After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2017, American DJ and electronic musician Porter Robinson tweeted, “I can make something good.” His words read as a mantra: the personal affirmation of an artist who had recently opened up about his struggles with depression. Four years later, the phrase resurfaced — this time during the chorus of “Look at the Sky,” the fourth single from Robinson’s sophomore album, “Nurture.” With bittersweet lyrics and uplifting production, “Look at the Sky” delivers a hopeful message for fans.
Robinson’s refusal to shy away from writing about his experiences with depression and self-doubt lends power to his gorgeous lyricism. This poignant honesty intensifies his hopeful declarations that “I will be much better then / And suddenly / I've restored your faith in me,” making the track both a joyous celebration of future possibilities and a tender acknowledgement of past realities.
However, “Look at the Sky” is not without flaws. The instrumental hook feels cliché in its sugary expression of positivity. In addition, although an energetic four-on-the-floor beat anchors “Look at the Sky,” as in many EDM tracks, Robinson truly shines in the quieter, more sentimental parts. As the pre-chorus begins, the beat drops out, leaving the listener with Robinson’s voice and a few instruments and synths. The beginning of the bridge strips this down even further, with only an acoustic guitar and Robinson’s voice remaining. Instead of allowing the listener to relax and anticipate the drop, these sparser sections outshine the choruses by providing a comforting refuge from the drop’s heavy and almost stale production.
However, it is difficult to discount a song so unabashedly hopeful in nature. During these uncertain times, in which life often feels overwhelmingly dark and isolating, “Look at the Sky” can serve as a mantra for so many — a reflection of their hopes for what the future might hold once the dark clouds pass. “I’m still here,” Robinson sings. “I can make something good.”

State Representative Jack P. Lewis, in partnership with the Boston Museum of Science and other members of the scientific community, announced at a virtual press conference on Feb. 4 that the dinosaur Podokesaurus holyokensis — also known as the swift-footed lizard of Holyoke — will be proposed to lawmakers as the official Massachusetts state dinosaur. Representative Lewis’s drive to establish a state dinosaur had gained massive support from educators, scientists, and citizens alike after Lewis announced the idea over Twitter.
For Representative Lewis, a primary goal of the state dinosaur project was to improve civic engagement and STEM education for Massachusetts citizens of all ages. Lewis said, “I was looking for an in, a bill that would allow me to have accessible conversations about the legislative process with both four-year-olds and 14-year-olds, in addition to 40-year-olds.” Lewis said that he hopes to educate citizens on the legislative process through this light-hearted bill. “Voting for which dinosaur you like is sort of like voting for which of the candidates on the ballot you want.”
Lewis spoke of his surprise and excitement over the widespread support for the project. “Paleontologists and people who worked in natural history museums, scientists, were all eager to explore what this project could mean for their own field of study,” Lewis said, “including everything from women in science and women in STEM, to better investments and support for STEM fields, to better understanding, prehistoric Massachusetts and the change of culture over time.”
Massachusetts citizens voted on two dinosaurs: Podokesaurus holyokensis and Anchisaurus polyzelus, which were described by Professor of Geology at Mount Holyoke College Mark McMenamin and Amherst College's Alfred Venne who works at the Beneski Museum. The two dinosaurs were the top — and only — picks for state dinosaur because, as Professor McMenamin said, “[they’re] the only game in town! There’s only two dinosaur skeletons that are known from the Hartford basin.” The winning dinosaur, Podokesaurus holyokensis, was around 3-6 ft long and 90 lbs, and could run roughly 9-12 mph.
Professor McMenamin went on to describe the winning dinosaur’s history, explaining that Podokesaurus holyokensis was discovered near Mount Holyoke, MA, and was significant as the first non-bird dinosaur to be named and described by a woman: Mignon Talbot. Talbot was a paleontologist and professor of geology from Holyoke College. Talbot’s discovery “was an incredible coup,” McMenamin said, “For a woman geoscientist to be publishing, in the American Journal of Science, a Yale University periodical in 1911—that was unheard of… It sort of shattered the glass ceiling for dinosaur science.”
Professor McMenamin is also looking forward to educating others on paleontology in Massachusetts, saying that having a state dinosaur is “exciting for science education, because it emphasizes that the remains of these creatures are right below our feet.” McMenamin hopes that this renewed excitement about paleontology will prompt the discovery of more dinosaur fossils in Massachusetts, saying, “I'm certain that there are many more dinosaurs to be discovered here in Massachusetts, particularly the Hartford basin… So I want people to have their eyes open. There's much more to be found and described here.”
Professor McMenamin isn’t the only person excited about the prospect of a state dinosaur with such a rich and inspiring history. The educator Nancy Stenberg showed the event to her students via virtual classroom and encouraged her students to vote on the state dinosaur. Stenberg used the dinosaur poll as a way to educate her students about science and the history of Massachusetts: “dinosaurs are something that the kids study in elementary school, and they also study the state… It fits in in so many different ways.” Stenberg also can’t wait to teach her students about Mignon Talbot, saying, “it's going to make a great follow-up lesson in March, for Women's History Month, because she's quite something!”
The MA state dinosaur facebook page and Museum of Science will continue posting updates about the progression of the state dinosaur bills (numbered HD 1392 and SD 698).

It’s about that time of year — Victoria Monét dropped her new single “F.U.C.K” on Feb. 1, just in time for some steamy Valentine’s Day escapades. From “Ass Like That” to “Moment,” the genius behind many of Ariana Grande’s hits never fails to disappoint on her own tracks. “F.U.C.K” is a must for any sophisticated consumer of music.
In just 205 seconds, Monét shows off a wide repertoire of throwback classics through the instrumentation and backing tracks in this song. Smooth rhythms coming from the drumset and Hi-hat layered over the heart-like pounding from the electric guitar. Monét keeps it classy, using sexy innuendos without explicitly divulging her desire to be a F.U.C.K. (A “Friend U Can Keep”). This is a conventional track with a chill tempo guaranteed to make you want to groove.
Monét’s silky voice can make anything sound smooth. After saying she wants to be a “friend u can keep,” she soon follows with “I’m just tryna jump your bones / We don’t gotta jump the broom, you know.” Does she just want a friend or something more? Well, why not both? In the opening verse, she sings, “Might not be the one but I’m definitely the prototype.” Things can never go south when nothing official is established, so why not just take your time and enjoy the ride? Monét seems to believe things are more fun without a label. Monet’s innuendo is always highly effective: “I think I want you to maybe meet me at my crib tonight:” Instead of directly saying “come over,” she dances around the idea to eliminate the pressure of the connection progressing to anything more serious than friendship.
It’s hard to decide the best aspect of this song, but the sultry harmonies in the bridge are definitely a top contender. While alluding to a more interesting ending, Victoria Monét stacks a few harmonies by repeating “oh.” Although not particularly breathtaking, they add onto the seductive tone presented throughout the song, acting as the icing on the cake.
Victoria Monét is definitely an underrated artist who deserves more recognition. While she may not be the greatest vocalist of all time, her lyricism more than makes up for that, and is what makes “F.U.C.K” one of her greatest songs yet.

Brent Faiyaz’s first release of 2021, “Gravity” featuring Tyler, the Creator, is both a genre-bending success and a relatable reflection on the difficulties of maintaining long-distance relationships.
Faiyaz is no stranger to distorting the normal boundaries of the hip-hop, rap, and contemporary R&B communities. In his early 2020 EP “Fuck the World,” Faiyaz explores everything from completely stripped vocals and snapping instrumentals on tracks like “Rehab (Winter in Paris),” to heavily pitched-down vocals and moaning ad libs on “Fuck the World.” When asked about the music industry’s tendency to immediately categorize Black artists, Faiyaz says: “I prefer to just make what I make. I feel like I’m in my own world with this shit, so I just focus on that.”
Faiyaz’s willingness to diversify his production elements leaves listeners feeling as though they too are in his unique world. Similar to “Rehab,” Faiyaz significantly pitches down his vocals while rapping the first verse and various ad-libs of “Home,” “Down,” and “Gone” throughout “Gravity.” This heaviness contrasts nicely with the lighter guitar and funky lo-fi bass line, contributed by Steve Lacy. As the deepest-sounding element of the instrumental, Faiyaz’s voice grounds listeners within his otherwise ethereal production. Accompanied by psychedelic visuals, “Gravity” transports listeners into a pseudo-acid trip, as though they have a bird’s eye view of reality on Earth.
Just as the instrumental components push listeners into an alternate reality, Faiyaz and Tyler’s admittance of everyday feelings like insecurity and desire pulls listeners back to the real world. Using galactic metaphors, they illustrate the unsatisfying reality of maintaining romantic relationships while rising fame pushes them worlds away. In reminiscing about his lover back home, Faiyaz says: “You held me up when I was down and out / But I don’t want you waitin’ ‘round for me (She hold me down).” Tyler echoes this sentiment in his brief verse as he says, “Hard to be down on Earth when you nestin’ on Mars.” Since balancing relationships with performing on the road is notoriously difficult for musicians, it’s refreshing to hear the harsh effects of fame reflected musically.
While most listeners aren’t touring musicians, the idea of home having a gravitational pull is oddly relatable at a time when it feels as though everyone is displaced from their loved ones. It’s undeniably hard to be connected to others when many are more physically, socially, and emotionally distanced than they’ve been in years prior.
As the world waits to return to normalcy, ‘Gravity’ pushes down the confines of genre and grants listeners a fun and thoughtful trip outside of reality — if only for a short 4 minutes).

As Valentine’s Day nears and as Covid-19 continues to confine us to our homes, there’s no better way to celebrate than by cuddling up with loved ones and watching a cozy, heartwarming film. Even if you’re single, the dreaded 14th of February can still be a fun day to sit back and relax with a funny movie — it will be a Sunday after all, so not even work can get in the way.
5. “Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown” Directed by Phil Roman, 1975
In the Valentine’s Day special, Charlie Brown (voiced by Duncan Watson) and his gang of quirky friends once again embark on an adorable journey on what many consider the worst holiday. As Charlie Brown prays and hopes to just get one valentine, the other kids do their best to get the most or the biggest. Even the pets trade cute cards. For youngsters dealing with a Valentine’s Day like no other, Charlie Brown can be a great opportunity to bring a sense of normalcy to a child’s life while also rekindling warm memories for adults.
4. “Warm Bodies” Directed by Jonathan Levine, 2013
Diverging from a typical lovey-dovey story, “Warm Bodies” follows the misadventures of a young woman named Julie (Teresa Palmer) as she faces death in the form of a zombie she nicknames R (Nicholas Hoult). The two embark on a journey of surprisingly touching self-discovery in the midst of a zombie uprising. Knowing that many people would rather gag than sit through the entirety of “The Fault in Our Stars,” the endearing yet goofy love story about a zombie who learns he still has a heart seems like the perfect film to watch this February.
3. “Sleepless in Seattle” Directed by Nora Ephron, 1993
Though far from a modern movie, the tale of Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) and Annie Reed’s (Meg Ryan) just happening into love is still a beloved classic. In this time-tested movie full of ‘90s perms and great sweaters, two everyday adults juggle the spontaneity of love and the value of in-person attraction. With great acting from a young Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, there’s no wondering why parents and children alike still know the name “Sleepless in Seattle.”
2. “About Time” Directed by Richard Curtis, 2013
When it comes to the classic romantic dramedy, one of the most popular movies — and undoubtedly the one that a number of couples will flock to — is “The Notebook.” It’s got Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, a cute and thoughtful multi-level story, and a cult-following. A movie that’s a little less well-known but rated just as high on IMDb is “About Time,” which in many ways outshines “The Notebook.” With the flair of British humor stoking the plot, “About Time” is a wonderful love story in which Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) falls in love with Mary (Rachel McAdams) without her even knowing it. As a time traveller who can only travel backwards in time, Tim meets Mary on a blind date, but fumbles his chance. The resulting story is one of almost-missed love and blindingly-cute lifelong adventures. The story continues with a fantastic father (Bill Nighy) adding the perfect touch of parental guidance and sage wisdom. There’s almost nothing better to watch on the loveliest of holidays than this truly heartwarming film that explores the value of every moment.
1. “Valentine’s Day” Directed by Garry Marshall, 2010
Because we live in a little bit of a dreary world, Valentine’s Day deserves to be paired with a light-hearted and ridiculously sweet movie: “Valentine’s Day.” Although seemingly trite and not excellently rated, the interwoven cutesy story of Los Angeles love is the perfect movie to watch with family, friends, or a significant other. With an ensemble cast featuring Ashton Kutcher, Jessica Alba, Jessica Biel, Bradley Cooper, Patrick Dempsey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Garner, Topher Grace, Anne Hathaway, Taylor Swift, Taylor Lautner and many more, just seeing some of the biggest names in Hollywood vying for screen time is worth the watch. To make it really stand out, the movie does an excellent job of juxtaposing genuinely hilarious moments with serious conversations about mistakes and lost love. “Valentine’s Day” is no Oscar-winning film, but it’s one that makes you laugh and cry at the same time.
Of course, with the dawn of the streaming age, there’s no reason to watch just one movie on Valentine’s Day. For those loathing the romance in all these titles, Peacock has all the “Harry Potter” Movies, Disney+ has “Star Wars”, and HBOMax has “Lord of the Rings” in 4K. On this Valentine’s Day, there’s bound to be something — and maybe even someone — out there for everybody.

January has always been a momentous month for hardcore J-Lo fans. Almost exactly twenty years ago, Jennifer Lopez made cultural history by being the first artist ever to hold the number #1 spot atop both the Billboard and box office charts in the United States simultaneously. This time last year, the mogul teamed up with Shakira to deliver one of the most dynamic Super Bowl halftime performances in recent memory. And on Jan. 20, in an admittedly befuddling series of events, Lopez performed the Woody Guthrie protest classic “This Land is Your Land” at President Joseph R. Biden’s inauguration — judiciously scrubbed, of course, of its most critical verses — before interpolating her 1999 hit “Let’s Get Loud” into the performance. A dynamic month, surely.
But on Jan. 23, the superstar threw a wrench in the excellent narrative she had spun thus far. In the middle of a global pandemic, with over 10 million people unemployed in the U.S. right now, the 52-year-old celebrated the aforementioned 20-year anniversary of her “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” era by attempting to start a TikTok-esque challenge. The premise of the #LoveDontCostAThingChallenge? Throw your valuables in the sand, kids!
In the palm-tree-lined video, Lopez begins her beach strut in a white trench coat and characteristically ginormous designer sunglasses, which are the first accessory to go. (“Think I wanna drive your Benz/I don’t” plays in the background — new forensics would confirm this, as it was alleged in 2019 that J-Lo had not driven since roughly 1994.) After the glasses, the coat is abandoned, revealing that the singer is wearing a graphic tee emblazoned with her own younger self. Next up is an ostensibly very expensive watch, tossed over her head like a superstitious salt ritual. As Lopez turns away from the camera, she commences the pièce de résistance: a slow, sensual removal of the aforementioned T-shirt, scandal cheekily averted at the last second.
It’s a fascinating 21 seconds, so delusional in its reading of the collective room that it takes on an air of surreality. Plus, the challenge itself was unclear: Film oneself stripping on a beach? Listen to “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” while tossing clothing around, location be damned?
Many Twitter replies lambasted Lopez for the tone-deafness of throwing valuables to the wind while millions await any semblance of government stimulus and the pandemic rages on. Others responded with GIFs and memes of them sifting through the sand for the jewelry she left behind. Twitter user @ronisverybusy wrote, “You want us all to rush to the beach in a pan de queso to have our friends film us throwing away good jewelry? I’m so confused.” With this comment, J-Lo got ratioed: That is, @ronisverybusy’s reply received nearly 10,000 more likes than Lopez’s original tweet.
Some loyal fans embraced the challenge, posting their own interpretations in their living rooms and hallways. Still, the hashtag didn’t quite catch on.
Since Jan. 23, J-Lo and her team have buried the initial video with clips from the singer’s latest Coach advertisement and a barrage of nostalgia press for the 20th anniversary of “The Wedding Planner.” But the video is still there, and indeed, Lopez’s particular brand of star power is timeless and arguably unassailable. This came close, but she marches on. J-Lo does not kowtow to her detractors, for better or for worse.
Lopez has always walked a fine line between proclaiming continued solidarity with her working-class Bronx roots and posing for lavish photoshoots at her bespoke Miami and LA mansions. Many other celebrities have attempted to maintain this balance, but few, if any, have been successful. Mega-celebrity conveys mega-wealth. When that celebrity draws on a narrative of social mobility, an inevitable clash of framing ensues. Lopez, who invokes Jenny from the Block to this day, walks this tightrope more visibly, and perhaps adeptly, than most. But by tossing off her jewelry on a sunny beach, Lopez made an exceedingly poor image calculation, bringing just how far removed she is from the daily life of the vast majority of Americans into heightened, glittery focus.
“Love Don’t Cost A Thing” is an iconic track, though. It does not deserve to become a casualty of this debacle!

The feminist punk movement in the Pacific Northwest was catalyzed by a Latina.
Mia Zapata, a Mexican-American punk rocker living in Seattle in the early 1990s, played a key role in shaping the nascent grunge movement with her band, The Gits. Known for their aggressive live performances and their straightforward, melodic punk music, the band, fronted by Zapata, quickly became popular among the feminist echelons of the Seattle punk movement. Their debut studio album, “Frenching the Bully,” was met with widespread support from the music community, and for the rest of their short-lived tenure, The Gits were musical mainstays in the punk and grunge scenes in Seattle.
In the ‘90s, Zapata was notable not just for her fiery lyrics and unapologetic stage presence, but also for taking up space as a Latina in a scene wholly dominated by white men (e.g. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden). Though her music focused rarely, if ever, on feminist politics, her presence in the movement was widely regarded as subversive all the same, and The Gits often played shows with more explicitly feminist bands like 7 Year Bitch.
In the summer of 1993, as The Gits were in the process of writing their second album, “Enter: The Conquering Chicken,” Zapata was brutally raped and murdered while walking home alone from a Seattle bar late at night. Seattle musicians fundraised to hire a private investigator, but the murderer wasn’t found until a decade later.
Immediately, her death sent the punk and grunge communities into a tailspin. A coalition of friends and fellow musicians created Home Alive, an anti-violence organization dedicated to teaching self-defense. Bands like Nirvana and 7 Year Bitch participated in benefit concerts or album releases to raise funds for Home Alive’s mission.
The tragedy also reinvigorated the Riot Grrrl movement — an underground punk and third-wave feminist movement committed to creating a space for women in punk while rallying against sexual assault and other dangerous manifestations of the patriarchy. Riot Grrrl band 7 Year Bitch, for example, released their classic sophomore album “¡Viva Zapata!” a year later in tribute to the singer, with many of the tracks commenting directly on her murder. In “M.I.A.,” singer Selene Vigil calls for vigilante justice against the murderer. Bikini Kill vocalist and Riot Grrrl activist Kathleen Hanna joined forces with established rockstar Joan Jett to pen “Go Home,” a song inspired by Zapata. The powerful music video showcases a woman who defends herself after being attacked late at night.
Of course, Zapata wasn’t the first Latina to make her name in the greater punk movement, though her role in the burgeoning ‘90s punk scene cannot be overstated. A decade earlier, Alice Bag, the Chicana frontwoman nicknamed “Violence Girl” for her aggressive performances, was already raging on stage as part of the East L.A. punk scene.
The legacy of Latinas in punk did not end with Zapata, either.
In Los Angeles today — a city which, in many ways, serves as a mecca for punk scenes — Latinx punk band Generacion Suicida plays melodic, ‘70s inspired punk tracks in L.A.’s underground venues. Latina Kiwi Martinez, the lead singer and drummer, is known for her tight, aggressive drumming inspired by hardcore scenes just as she is known for her Spanish language lyrics. Their motto, “Musica del barrio, para el barrio” (music of the neighborhood, for the neighborhood”), underlies recurring themes of alienation and the Latinx experience in their music.
All-Latina bands Destruye y Huye and Las Cochinas — hailing from L.A. and Santa Clarita, respectively — also make up the fabric of L.A.’s punk scene, where they play on-and-off in the city’s DIY shows.
In San Antonio, all-female Chicanx band Fea plays punk music that’s as powerful sonically as it is politically. “No Hablo Español,” a track from their self-titled debut album, reflects on the pressures placed upon Latinx immigrants in the U.S. to abandon their native cultures in order to fit in. Produced by fellow Chicana Alice Bag and released by Joan Jett’s Blackheart Records, the track was ranked by Village Voice as one of the best protest songs of 2016 and established Fea as one to watch in the punk genre.
Outside the U.S., Latinas in punk are gaining speed as well. Costa Rica’s Las Robertas have made themselves known globally as they play in major festivals worldwide. In Argentina, post-punk band Las Kellies explore the intersections of punk and reggae influence to critical acclaim. And in Mexico, Ruido Rosa has been lauded as “one of the hopes in bringing back the lost rock n’ roll essence to Mexico’s rock music.”
Unlike the bands made up by the Latina iconoclasts that preceded them, these newer punk outfits are less restrained by the need to be overtly political in their femininity. Instead, their music exists primarily as pure, unbridled punk pushing against the confines of the mainstream, much like Zapata’s own.

Internationally, the Latinx punk movement only continues to grow. Across Latin America and the United States, new scenes continue to crop up in places where the genre was once overlooked (such as Toledo, Ohio) and to expand in places where punk has long been a cultural mainstay (like Bogotá, Colombia). Once a genre reserved mainly for white, cis, heterosexual men, punk has more readily embraced the idea that its community should be a refuge for those who don’t fit in with or who want an escape from the mainstream. The Latinx community within the genre — namely the women and people of color — has played a big role in furthering that vision.
In New York City, it’s bands like Las Ratas en Zelo, an all-female outfit whose members pride themselves on their hard-hitting punk music which comes at fans with “more ESTROGEN than ever!!!” according to their Facebook page. Performing in both English and Spanish, the band is a mainstay in the city’s punk scene, where they have performed at various events including the 2018 celebration, Latinx Punk Fest.
In Monterrey, Mexico, it’s bands like Cremalleras. The female-fronted duo — inspired by the music of Chicana punk rocker Alice Bag — makes loud, unapologetic punk music driven by fierce drumming and even fiercer vocals. Songs like “Ex-Novios” (ex-boyfriends) are almost violent in their musicality as the singer rages against past flames.
In Bogotá, it’s female-fronted band Exilio, a group of Venezuelan refugees living in Bogotá who bring scathing political commentary into their performances. In Minneapolis, it’s Verminoze, a more melodic punk band that has been making music since 2015 with a sound similar to Los Saicos of 1960s Peru. In Toledo, it’s the hardcore band Frente Norte, known for being one of the only Spanish-singing punk groups in Ohio. And in Mexico City, it’s bands like Riña, an all-female hardcore group, who further the reach of Latinx punk beyond their home city.
The list of Latinx punk rockers taking the movement by storm is endless and part of a grander tradition forwarded by the Latinx punk legends that made their own scenes, primarily in Los Angeles and throughout Latin America, from as early as the 1960s.
Like the punk bands that took Latin America by storm in the 1980s during the third wave of democracy in the region, many of the punk groups making music now do so with politically-charged lyrics. Though the time and place has changed, the content of the music has largely remained the same. Bands like Diversity in Los Angeles are still protesting the same oppressive structures as their predecessors. Inspired by punk bands of the Reagan era and their own political rhetoric, Diversity writes music about issues specific to the Latinx community.
Still, the Latinx punk movement has room to grow in terms of inclusivity.
Though there are increasing numbers of female-led, femme, and queer punks in the scene —  like L.A.’s Causa, a “queer people of color punk” band who write about issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community, for example — the fact of the matter is that the men in the scene are still seen more prominently. Many simply blame the machismo of the Latinx community, but to simply write it off as a Latinx-only problem would be to ignore the long-standing sexism and misogyny that has kept women out of music scenes across the board. At the same time, bands like New York’s female-fronted group Olor A Muerte are actively taking a stand against this very misogyny with politically-charged tracks like “Fuck Your Macho Behavior,” in which lead vocalist Analia sings out against the scene’s machismo: “Fuck your macho behavior / I wanna feel safe…. You just care about your stupid shows  / We don’t like you.”
Though many of these Latinx punk musicians have yet to receive enough attention or validation from more exclusive, mainstream punk circles, the space they take up is only growing. In spaces like New York, where the general punk movement is smaller and more diverse, these otherwise segregated movements are blending and sharing influences, facilitated by key music venues like ABC No Rio on the Lower East Side. As movements continue to expand and globalize, the role of of Latinx punks will continue to grow and innovate at the fore of the genre — just as Los Saicos did in the very beginning, way back in 1964.

The pas de deux is arguably the centerpiece of classical ballet. Traditionally, it features a man and a woman dancing together, each performing solos, and then coming together once more for a coda. When the two are dancing on stage together, the job of the man is to support and present the ballerina, because “Ballet is woman,” as George Balanchine famously (or perhaps notoriously) said. While this may be true, there is much to be questioned about the role of gender in ballet.
Classical ballet contains extremely strict gender roles, with men and women performing different types of movements and dancing very different roles. In schools, though everyone takes barre and center together, the boys will then leave for a separate “men’s class” while the girls focus on pointework. Dress codes are gendered as well — pink tights and black leotards for the girls, black tights and white shirts for the boys. This rigid divide leaves little room for flexibility or the inclusion of those whose gender identity don’t fit within the traditional cisgender roles on which ballet is built.
Though companies like the all-male drag Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo exist, the company is meant to perform parodies, with a comedic element. Opportunity and inclusion of non-binary dancers in classical ballet are nearly nonexistant, and the stark gender divide may be difficult to surmount for transgender dancers. In 2018, Chase Johnsey broke barriers when he became the first man to perform in a female role in a major ballet company—English National Ballet. Though positively received, some, like former New York City Ballet principal Wendy Whelan, were cautious in their response, citing the possibility of yet more obstacles for women in a world already stacked against them.
Returning to the pas de deux, the ballet world has only recently begun to see more subversion of its traditional structure, albeit mostly with contemporary pas de deux consisting of two men. American Ballet Theater’s recent work “Touche” was groundbreaking as their first all male pas de deux and was also explicitly gay coded. Though these works are proof of progress and the breakdown of stifling traditions, they are once again primarily creating opportunities for men and not women. While perhaps this imbalance is due to higher visibility of gay males in ballet or the ability of men to perform partnering feats like lifts, standalone pieces such as the Royal Ballet’s 2017 “Duet” help to create barrier-breaking opportunities for women as well. A rare piece in the ballet world, “Duet” was choreographed for two women—by a female choreographer, no less.
Whelan’s reservations about Johnsey’s historic performance, while perhaps overblown in this context, are grounded in reality. As the first female in a position of artistic leadership at NYCB, she certainly knows the glass ceilings of ballet all too well. Though there are typically more women in a company of dancers than men, positions of power — artistic direction and choreography — have nearly always been, and continue to be, held by men. Underneath the showmanship of Balanchine’s “Ballet is woman,” these positions that dictate female visibility on stage are once again ultimately controlled by men, a reality that might even be said to be reflected in the choreography of the classical ballet canon. As dance critic Alastair Macaulay considers, is the male partner behind the ballerina “serving her or controlling her?”
Ballet, as an art form tied to tradition, can be a deeply sexist and exclusive place. But women are slowly but surely breaking through the glass ceiling and proving their capabilities. Tamara Rojo, artistic director of English National Ballet, is one of those rare women in a position of power at a major ballet company. She has successfully led the company to infinitely greater prestige in the last decade, while continuing to dance as a principal ballerina, and was also the director who gave the previously mentioned Chase Johnsey the radical opportunity to dance in the female corps.
Within the choreography and narratives of the classical ballet canon, there is certainly room to reevaluate how these works present and represent women and power dynamics between the sexes. Moreover, the ballet world must learn to let go of some of its rigidity and actively work to become a more inclusive and welcoming place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hockey occupies a unique, liminal position within the American sports landscape. Straddling the boundary between popular phenomena like football and more niche, prep school pastimes like lacrosse, it tends to attract most of its players from only select regions of the country, but in the places where it takes hold, it inspires a zealous devotion unlike anything else.
Half sports memoir, half reflection on fatherhood, Rich Cohen’s “Pee Wees” distills this fanaticism into a roughly 200-page journey through one hockey season with the Ridgefield Bears, the team on which Cohen’s own son, Micah, plays. In the author’s note, Cohen tells the reader that this year-long slate of hockey games encapsulates “the highest highs and the lowest lows” of his life with Micah, a statement which he goes on to support by imbuing each goal, injury, and coaching decision with life-altering importance.
The book’s richest scenes come when Cohen reckons with the sheer absurdity of the posturing and politicking carried on by the Ridgefield parents, whose children’s successes and failures define not only their mood but also their perceived status in the eyes of their hockey-watching peers. However, the book’s singular preoccupation with the sport of hockey itself often undermines its more compelling examination of the human drama unfolding off the ice.
The pace of Cohen’s narration is as brisk and quick-hitting as the game it spends so much of its time describing; the very experience of reading “Pee Wees” contains the same rhythms found within any season-long schedule of hockey games. Initial wide-eyed optimism gives way to euphoria one minute and despair the next, depending on whether the team happens to be winning or losing. The climax sees Micah’s Bears squaring up against their arch-rivals in a pivotal game with their parents looking on, white-knuckled — their mental state hanging precariously in the balance.
Cohen’s authorial talents primarily reveal themselves through his detailed descriptions of these parents — middle-aged professionals, most of them married, who have just a little bit too much riding on their offspring’s exploits on the ice. The way they watch their children play feels less like parental concern and more like the jitters of a gambler watching money slip away. Some drink in the stands to calm their nerves, others heckle the referee, and a few go so far as to become assistant coaches so that they can ensure their children have every opportunity to succeed. It is for these coaches — Coach Hendrix in particular — that Cohen himself seems to harbor the most resentment, often expressing anger about how they give their own children more ice time than Micah and looking down upon them for this nepotism while ostensibly sinking to their level.
Unfortunately, Cohen often relegates these adult conflicts to the edges of his story, as the increasingly repetitive breakdown of hockey games take center stage time and time again. To be clear, his gameplay narration captures the action in an eminently readable fashion that will surely appeal to any hockey fan, but this often comes at the expense of the more interesting stories unfolding off the ice. “Dance Moms”-esque drama only gets fleshed out in limited detail because the book appears far more interested in mimicking the structure of “Sportscenter.” As a result, the story lacks urgency; Cohen only gives his readers glimpses of why it demands telling.
At several points, “Pee Wees” gestures at the bigger ideas that it never quite gets around to exploring in detail. In the actions of Coach Rizzo, another of the aforementioned “parent-coaches,” Cohen sees “the corruption of America.” “As America fades as a dream, it becomes every man for himself,” he proclaims, in reference to the cut-throat culture of youth hockey. Yet lines like these are almost always presented in passing, offered as an explanation for low-level injustices like a player getting benched; Cohen never makes a sustained effort to interrogate the driving forces behind the culture that he so often bemoans.
Perhaps exposing how and why youth sports in America have grown into a corporatized, money-fueled behemoth in recent years was never Cohen’s intention in the first place. After all, “Pee Wees” is a carefully crafted love letter to a game that clearly means the world to both the author and his son. However, it lets slip the opportunity to offer a more nuanced critique of the greed, politics, and narcissism that drive parents to turn youth hockey from recreation to a matter of life and death.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Western genre is not the first that comes to mind when looking for literary fiction exploring femininity, gender, and identity. However, readers who pick up Anna North’s most recent literary release, “Outlawed” are in store for just that, along with intimate prose and fast-paced action.
“In the year of our lord 1894, I became an outlaw. Like a lot of things, it didn’t happen all at once.” Such begins the riveting, action-packed tale of Ada. A reimagining of the Western genre through an alternate history with a feminist lens, North crafts a compelling tale following Ada as she’s forced to forge a new life for herself after discovering she is unable to conceive a child. As Ada journeys from hometown to covenant to a role as a doctor in the notorious Hole in the Wall Gang, readers are in for a meaningful tale of adventure and hope in the face of strife.
“Outlawed” reads as a campfire confessional told from the perspective of Ada, who is as determined and intelligent as they come. The novel shares an engrossing account of both her internal and external development. The heart of the novel lies in Ada’s introspection of her emotional and mental state as she experiences love, loss, triumph, and failure. Ada is by no means a perfect protagonist, but she’s honest and good-hearted, making her failures heartbreaking and her triumphs all the more impactful.
Ada’s tale is accompanied by a cast of complex, gripping characters — most prominently, her fellow outlaws in the Hole in the Wall Gang. All of whom share a history of mistreatment by their community — with stories exploring issues of gender, race, and sexuality. Ada’s relationships reveal that companionships are earned, not given, as Ada goes from distrusted newcomer to trusted friend. Each character’s diverging opinions create tension, making for intriguing conflict among allies. However, because of the narrative’s focus on Ada’s story and the sheer number of people in the gang, some of these other characters feel one-dimensional comparatively, and the important issues raised by their diverse identities feel woefully under-explored.
The most interesting concept that “Outlawed” contributes to the literary zeitgeist is a new exploration of reproductive trauma. Stories of women who can’t conceive, or have other mental and physical wounds related to their reproductive lives are not uncommon. Despite this trend, many works with this kind of backstory make the women one-dimensional and convey a narrative that infertility is the worst (and only) misfortune to happen to a woman. As for “Outlawed”, it takes place in an alternate historical timeline, where a disastrous flu causes much of the female population to be “barren” or unable to conceive. Unsurprisingly, society blames the women, shunning them from society under thinly veiled accusations of witchcraft and treachery.
Ada’s journey in the novel is not about her trying to “fix” her reproductive issues, or even fully come to terms with her barrenness. Rather, Ada’s tale is one of finding purpose and fulfillment outside of the expectation of marriage and motherhood. Ada seeks out knowledge to understand why women are barren, and she fights for those women to be treated with the same respect and care that society gives to women who can conceive. With Ada’s aspirations, “Outlawed” provides a refreshing take on an issue that has been beaten to death with the same storyline time and time again.
Overall, “Outlawed” is a fascinating, feminist take on the Western genre. Anna North’s thoughtful prose and strong narrative arcs shine in this novel that is well worth a read. Though filled with fun action and various hijinks, at the core of “Outlawed” is a powerful tale about agency and ambition. Readers can find poignant resonance with a character devoted to creating the change she wants to see in the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To paint with broad strokes, members of the Harvard outdoors and climate change advocacy communities have a type — a flannel-wearing, tree-hugging, tofu-powered, Bernie-loving type. I call this community the granola advocates. You’ve probably noticed us around Harvard Yard. We’re usually yelling.
As a self-identifying member of “crunchy” culture, I have been quick to critique University President Lawrence S. Bacow and United States President Joe Biden’s climate change agendas. This is not uncommon: Granola advocates are uncompromising by choice. We are the people who camp outside of President Bacow’s office — in our mom jeans, thrifted shirts, and too-big glasses — demanding Harvard divest from fossil fuels, even after the administration made a commitment that the endowment will release “net-zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, mirroring the timeline set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
Our criticism feels particularly extreme when numerous progressive environmental organizations such as The Sunrise Movement have praised Biden’s climate change agenda. Especially compared to his predecessor, Biden’s decisive actions including rejoining the Paris Agreement – less than a year after President Donald Trump officially withdrew from it – come as a relief.
The realist in me pleads with her crunchy hippie twin to give in to the moderate eye-rollers and naysayers; we’ve won by electing a climate change advocate, now let’s talk about anything else besides the end of the world. The problem, my hippie voice replies, is that even the most progressive climate change goals proposed aren’t aggressive enough to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.
While taking a stand for effective climate change action is exhausting, endless, and scary at times, setting weak climate change goals is unacceptable, especially for leaders who claim to listen to science. While we are almost there, enough is never enough when it comes to ensuring a prosperous future for subsequent generations.
The Paris Agreement is a 2015 deal between 190 state parties and signatories agreeing to limit global warming “to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” Paris asserts that doing so will “significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.” Other institutions including many universities have supported the plan and Harvard appears to have matched its own climate commitments to the Paris timeline.
Although the U.S. and Harvard are now on a better path to curbing their emissions than ever before, Paris’s aggressive 1.5 degree Celsius goal – and even more so the scalding 2 degrees Celsius cap – is not safe.
In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a leading international body designed to assess climate change, never stated that a 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees warming goal is safe. The IPCC instead reports that warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius will produce changes capable of destabilizing our human institutions.
1.5 degrees Celsius warming would increase the mean and max temperatures in most land and ocean regions. More precipitation and disastrous floods would inundate some areas. Other regions would be plagued by droughts and wildfires. Such natural disasters could destroy infrastructure, slow economic growth, and increase political instability. Accelerating sea level rise would engulf coastal cities and island nations, fueling the refugee crisis. Ocean acidification and associated habitat loss would destroy biodiversity while disrupting food sources.
All of us will suffer on a 1.5 degrees warmer planet, but BIPOC communities, women, and individuals of a lower socioeconomic status, who tend to be the least to blame for global warming, will be particularly exposed. Such communities are disproportionately impacted by climate change because of compounding factors such as on-average lower incomes, less medical care access, and limited political influence resulting in problems funding climate change adaptation and disaster relief.
In other words, we have only made the first step in a long road to recovery. We cannot become complacent.
Atmospheric warming should not exceed 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures in order to protect our most vulnerable, a bar we have already surpassed. In the U.S., carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by about 80 percent by 2030 and to 100 percent by 2050 while protecting and expanding carbon sinks.
Instead of internalizing the warning enmeshed in the IPCC Reports’ findings, it appears that global leaders have treated Paris’s unjustified 1.5 degrees Celsius goal as gospel. As a result, decision-makers in the Biden administration, at Harvard, and elsewhere are implementing insufficient climate change mitigation goals.
In protest of these insufficient policies, granola advocates will continue to shout and sing, write and recite, unsatiated. The problem is that we are too small a minority at Harvard and around the world to make our local leaders — much less the President of the United States — listen.
Basically, we can’t do it alone.
To be an environmental advocate, you don't have to purchase Birkenstocks and kiss goodbye to capitalism. You do, however, need to embrace the same relentless pursuit of change, focus on the details, and find within yourself the conviction that we all can and must do better for one another and for future generations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I watched the insurrection at the United States Capitol unfold last month, I was surprised at the amount of diversity I saw throughout the crowd. I’m not talking about cultural, racial, or even religious diversity, but rather the myriad of different flags and related political symbols littered across the Capitol. On the one hand, some of these flags were familiar: The Betsy Ross flag of the original 13 colonies and the generic “Trump 2020” and “MAGA” banners were all strewn across Capitol Hill. On the other hand, I saw many I didn't recognize. There was a white flag with a red cross, a yellow flag with three red stripes, a green flag with black and white stripes, and many more.
However, one flag stood out to me from among the rest, and it was the one I had seen countless times before. With its sharp red background and intersecting blue stripes filled with white stars, the Confederate flag stuck out from the sea of colors. I eventually learned that many of the unfamiliar flags represented various far-right movements that I detest, ranging from QAnon to the Proud Boys. Still, the presence of the Confederate flag bothered me the most.
Why? So many of these movements start from the same misinformed hate, but that specific flag bothered me more.
This is the question I asked myself as I struggled to understand the reasoning behind the flag's appearance at the Capitol. As a Black person, that Confederate flag has always represented the beliefs of a people who fought to uphold the enslavement of my entire race. And while not everyone has this same background, what has always confused me is that it seems that the most outwardly patriotic Americans are the same ones who fly the Confederate flag with pride. It’s paradoxical — the Confederates took up arms against the “beloved” Union, so their existence should be hated, right? Clearly not, and for many, it is the exact opposite.
A poll taken by the Morning Consult and Politico in July of 2020 found that 43 percent of voters still believe that the Confederate flag represents “Southern pride” — including 74 percent of Republicans. It’s unnerving. And this revision of history doesn’t seem to just stop with the flag. There seems to be a prevailing theme throughout America that the United States Civil War was about anything but slavery.
For example, in December of last year, a popular conservative media company, PragerU, posted a now-deleted video defending Confederate general Robert E. Lee’s legacy, going so far as to imply that one of his greatest accomplishments was “crushing an attempted slave rebellion by radical abolitionist John Brown.” PragerU isn’t a small company; it has more than 2.86 million subscribers on Youtube and has amassed over a billion views on its videos. Millions of people are consuming and further spreading this material, and it only continues the cycle of misinformation.
Still, many people who understand the history of the Civil War do believe that it is an important enough reason to put away the Confederate flag, but to them, the issue just seems trivial. I’ve heard many comments like, “Why are we worrying about this, aren’t there much more prevalent issues in the world right now?” and “The Civil War ended ages ago — things can change, right?” Or, ironically, “Most Black people don’t even care that much, so let’s just move on.”
And surprisingly, I somewhat agree. The Confederate flag itself isn’t the most pressing issue in the world, and it isn’t even too common in urban areas where most Americans live. However, the real issue is that the flag represents the distrust many Americans have of scientific and historical consensus.
It doesn’t surprise me that 15 percent of Americans believe we have currently taken enough steps to fight climate change or that 10 percent of us believe vaccines cause autism, with 46 percent unsure. If issues like these remain contested, what do we expect to do for more layered problems like healthcare, immigration, and education reform? These people are our voting population — and when 43 percent of them still cannot recognize what the Confederate flag truly stands for, it’s not surprising that America is extremely slow to move forward.
So to answer my own question, the Confederate flag bothers me because it represents the deep dissemination of falsehoods into society that powerful actors don't do enough to dismantle. Harvard affiliates benefit from the social clout the school carries, and that should come with the responsibility to push back against false information. Many Harvard graduates go on to fill powerful leadership roles within society, and their voices all hold weight. As a collective, we can fight against many of the false narratives pushed in society.
We live in a democracy, and the people themselves have to agree on our history before any meaningful social change can occur. This just hasn’t happened yet. While I continue to be optimistic, something tells me that America is in for a very long ride towards reunification with fact.

After a grueling 11 months in a pandemic-shaken world, vaccines are finally here – quite literally, in Harvard’s case. Housed within our very gates sit shipments packed with vaccine doses, many of which have already been granted to Harvard affiliates made eligible for vaccination under Phase One of Massachusetts’ distribution plan. Once the University replenishes its load, Phase Two vaccinations will also be distributed to eligible and itching recipients.
Up until this point, we’ve all (hopefully) done our part to mitigate the spread of the virus. We’ve worn masks and religiously sanitized our hands, embraced new concepts like “social distancing” and “shelter-in-place,” and reconfigured how milestones like birthdays and graduations are commemorated, all in the name of public health.
Now, we have one more responsibility: getting the vaccine as soon as it becomes available to each of us.
The urgency of this duty should be intuitive. Covid-19 has infected more than 26 million people and killed more than 450 thousand in the United States alone. It has taken a disproportionately scathing toll upon the elderly and devastated communities of color. And it has exacerbated pre-existing inequities, shaking vulnerable populations across the country and the world. Inevitably, fighting this virulent outspread means that we need to get vaccinated – as many of us as possible, as quickly as possible.
As Harvard affiliates, our access to healthcare is greatly improved – for proof, we need not look further than the same-day Covid-19 testing that has been guaranteed to all on-campus residents since August while nationwide testing shortages persist. Now, Harvard is also armed with the tools required to immunize us, and it will soon be able to wield them once Massachusetts greenlights vaccines for the general public. This elevates us to a position of extreme privilege – one which comes with equally tremendous levels of responsibility. It is requisite that, from this privileged place, we think hard about our neighbors, vigilantly work to safeguard our friends, and firmly protect the surrounding metropolitan. Ultimately, there is no better time to interrogate our role in the fight against Covid-19, and to staunchly hold ourselves to account.
Just as we have a responsibility to receive the vaccine, Harvard has a responsibility to create conditions conducive to its widespread use. Vaccine hesitancy is partly an equity issue – one that disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. Distrust in these communities of medical professionals is deep-seated and profound, rooted in a painful history of deadly mistreatment that cannot be erased. Vaccine misinformation also plays a large role in why so many vaccine doses have gone untaken by eligible Americans. To do its share to promote vaccination, Harvard, ever-influential and a research authority, should actively work to quash repeatedly-debunked vaccine myths and animate itself around the hard task of quelling medical mistrust in vulnerable communities.
Beyond that, if Harvard decides to make students’ return to campus next fall contingent upon vaccine retrieval, it is essential that the supply be made free and easily accessible to all members of the community. This will be a rocky, difficult endeavor – not least because affiliates are currently spread out across the nation and globe. Aggravating this challenge, too, is growing trepidation about the lack of vaccine access lower income countries face after richer nations snagged vaccine stock. Given the complexity of the moment, we do not expect there to be any “perfect” vaccination plan, and unfortunately, it seems Covid’s exacerbation of inequality will deeply impact who is protected from it first. But we should not let the perfect become the enemy of the good. So long as the University is committed to vaccinating as many affiliates as possible, the community and the world will benefit.
The longer this pandemic goes on, the more all of us will hurt — not only from the virus’s physical toll but also from the pressure of enormous social strain and burgeoning economic stress. If we ever want life to return to normal, whatever that may look like in a virus-scarred world, we must commit to this final push. There is no winning without the vaccine.

More than 60 student and faculty volunteers provided free dental services to children at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine’s annual “Give Kids a Smile” event on Saturday.
The event — which administers free dental cleanings, oral examinations, and referrals — is part of the national “Give Kids a Smile” initiative that aims to increase accessibility to dental care.
Dental School students Ziwei Chen, Kadriye E. Hargett, and Jessica K. Murphree helped organize the event.
Chen, Hargett, and Murphree said organizers had to think of new ways to provide the same services while complying with the state’s social distancing guidelines due to the pandemic.
In previous years, Chen said the clinic hosted between 40 to 50 patients to come and receive free oral consultations and diagnoses.
This year, however, the number of patients permitted to receive in-person treatment was capped at 24. Patients signed up for their consultation online beforehand.
Families who were unable to receive in-person appointments during the event were given virtual consultations and follow-up care in person at a later date.
Chen said the virtual consultations allowed students and faculty to better understand the patient and ensure efficiency during the follow-up appointments.
“That saves time and saves the patients a lot of trouble coming in and out of the clinic, especially during Covid,” Chen said.
She added that patients who come in for follow-up appointments after virtual consultation will not be charged for their services.
The educational component of the event had to be shifted to a virtual format entirely.
In previous years, first-year and second-year dental students gave in-person presentations to families about oral health, dental hygiene and diet, proper brushing and flossing methods, and the importance of frequent dental appointments.
This year, Chen said dental students filmed videos of themselves explaining these concepts and sent them to the patients and their families to watch at home.
Families who had regularly attended the annual “Give Kids a Smile” event in years past were initially disappointed with its new virtual format, according to Hargett.
“This was a tradition they felt like they were missing out on, and they were just upset that they couldn't be one of those 24 in-person appointments,” Hargett said. “But thankfully, we were able to reassure them that they're going to be able to come in for a follow-up appointment.”
Murphree noted that the virtual appointments guaranteed access to families who live farther away from the clinic and accommodated patients who have hesitations about seeing a dentist in-person.
“We're also hoping that this will become more commonplace and that we'll do this year-to-year if there are people who can't come in or don't want to come in right away,” Murphree said.
Faculty dentists and students will follow up with patients who received treatment or consultations during the event. The organizers also plan to compile resources detailing where patients can be treated on a more regular basis based on their insurance plans.
“I personally really want Give Kids a Smile to be a starting point to a lifelong journey of having great oral health,” Chen said. “We just want to empower our patients to have all the right tools or resources to start that journey.”

In an update to the City Council on Monday, Cambridge officials announced that the city is moving forward with its reopening plans, despite an ongoing vaccine supply shortage in the city.
The city officially entered “Phase Three, Step 1” of its reopening process on Monday as case numbers continue to improve, according to City Manager Louis A. DePasquale.
Under the new phase, gyms, museums, and restaurants can operate at 40 percent capacity, up from 25 percent. In addition, libraries can resume contactless pickup. Indoor gatherings, however, are still limited to 10 individuals and outdoor events must remain under 25 people.
New Covid-19 infections have decreased since January, when the positivity rate in Cambridge reached its peak. The city continues to ramp up its testing regime, administering 4,919 tests last week and 31,595 last month, according to DePasquale.
There have been 4,489 confirmed cases in Cambridge since the start of the pandemic, with an active case rate of approximately 21 percent.
Due to the statewide shortage of vaccine doses, Cambridge still does not have a public vaccination site. Instead, Cambridge Health Alliance, Mount Auburn Hospital, and Beth Israel Hospital are reaching out to eligible patients to administer doses via individual appointment, according to DePasquale.
DePasquale said that while Cambridge has the infrastructural capacity to host a public site, he reiterated the city has “no control or authority” over the acquisition of additional doses, a responsibility that lies with the state. As of Feb. 5, Massachusetts vaccinators have administered 754,874 vaccines — 61 percent of the doses provided by the federal government.
“Our teams are ready to go as soon as the state provides us the vaccines needed to provide a site,” DePasquale said. “As you can imagine every community is trying to have vaccine locations in their community, not going to a neighboring community. We will continue to advocate for a site in Cambridge.”
“There is a possibility that we will not be able to have a Cambridge-specific public site in our city,” he added.
Claude Jacob, the city’s chief public health officer, said Cambridge is prioritizing residents over age 75 as it waits for the state to approve vaccinations for individuals over age 65 and those with at least two comorbidities.
“We are making sure that we are at the ready, so that we can at least ensure that we have ample vaccines on hand,” Jacob said.
According to Jacob, the state increased Cambridge’s vaccine allotment on Friday from 100 to 400 vaccines per week, which has allowed the city to ramp up its distribution efforts. For now, its efforts are focused on vaccinating the 1,300 residents and staff who live and work at the Cambridge Housing Authority’s 10 senior residence facilities.
Massachusetts has also launched a $2.5 million dollar public awareness campaign, called “Trust the Facts, Get the Vax,” to raise public awareness about the vaccine’s safety and efficacy.
“There's still even some misinformation out there, and so our goal is really to respond and reach out to specific communities around vaccine safety, confidence, rollout, and access,” Jacob said.
After the meeting, Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80 said it was “frustrating” to hear how little control the city has over vaccine distribution compared to Covid-19 testing, though she was encouraged by the city’s vaccination efforts so far.
“It was both heartening because many of our first responders, our homeless population [were] prioritized, and are now either getting the second dose or have gotten the second dose,” she said. “But it's very, very frustrating to realize that there's so many other people who are on the priority list eventually, but haven't been able to get it yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Diego Flores ’23 saw people on Reddit buying stock in GameStop, the struggling video game retail outlet chain, he didn’t take them seriously at first.
“I initially thought it was a joke,” he said. “I didn't really think much of it. And then it starts hitting the news, and GameStop stock skyrockets by like, 100%. I was like, ‘Damn it – I could have gotten in there earlier.’” He immediately bought $4,000 of stock, which he later sold for more than $800 in profit.
Flores was one of several Harvard students who jumped on the market trend and bought stock in struggling companies early this month. Several of them said in interviews that they had varying prior experience in investing, and held mixed motivations for making the risky investment — from an attempt to earn extra money, to a desire to punish the hedge funds that had bet on the stock prices going down.
For Hayden T. Teeter ’24, the $2,000 he invested in GameStop as the prices began to rise was his first real foray into investing.
“I’d been talking with my dad about opening a day trading account since last April, because he wanted me to pick up some kind of hobby over the Covid shutdown,” he said.
Teeter had been following a subreddit called “Wall Street Bets.” When he saw the price of Gamestop stock spiking, he took the opportunity.
With his parents’ permission, he used funds in their Fidelity account to invest in GameStop. For that week, he said, the whole family tracked the stock obsessively, talking about it at lunch and dinner.
As Teeter began to pay more attention, what started as a plan to “go to the casino and ride off with as much money as possible” quickly took on a more ideological character — he realized that his investment could bring about “systemic change,” he said.
“It’s like a little bit of class warfare,” he said. “It kind of feels like Occupy Wall Street, round two. But instead of it becoming a joke, this is real – it’s actually making people think twice about letting very rich finance people do whatever they want."
Teeter said he sold his stock before the price came down, netting more than $1,000 in profit.
Noah P. Tavares ’24 has been investing and closely following the stock market since middle school, and has become “successful” at it in the past couple of years, he said. But his investment in GameStop was different.
Tavares, who is in the Harvard Investment Association, realized early on that for him, investing in GameStop was no longer about GameStop, or even about profit.
Because he came to see the trend as a “redistribution tactic” that aimed to tackle “deep social and economic inequities” in the U.S., he said he decided to hang on to his stock even after the stock price peaked, out of “solidarity” with Americans hurt by Wall Street.
“I do believe people believed that this was a redistribution tactic,” he said. “And I’m certainly not going to be the one who sells and burns these people’s chance at whatever they're trying to do into the ground.”
Tavares said he only sold the stock last Thursday, after it became clear hedge funds had weathered the attack by retail investors.
“To be honest, the funds crushed it entirely, right?” he added. “They played it smart.”
Other experienced traders at Harvard decided to spurn the trend, opting for safer, long-term investments. Patrick J. Rak ’24, a member of the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, said he did not invest in GameStop.
“I’m more of a long-term investor myself, so I focus mainly on trying to get good returns years on into the future,” Rak said. He added that he would advise new investors seeking “long-term sustained growth” to “invest in really solid companies that would sustain past a crash.”
The GameStop saga left several of the Harvard investors reflecting on the implications of pursuing finance as a profession.
Although his experience investing in GameStop made him interested in learning more about finance, it put him off the idea of making a career of it, Teeter said.
“It seems way too dirty,” he said. “I’d rather not be someone on the other end who's manipulating the markets, shorting people — that just that just feels wrong to me.”
Tavares, on the other hand, said he was not dissuaded from considering eventually finding work at a hedge fund.
“I complain about the hedge funds a lot, but let’s be honest, that’s also a career path that most Harvard students, or a lot of Harvard students, would like to take,” he said. “This pretty much proves you can’t really win by betting against the funds.”
The ways he believed the hedge funds sustained their market clout during the episode — the New York Times reported on allegations that a popular trading platform had colluded with hedge funds to bar investors from trading GameStop and other stocks — ended up convincing Tavares that “it would definitely be cool to be on the other side of this,” he said.
“You don’t think that they’re just going to halt the trading,” he added. “You don’t believe that until it happens. And when it happens you say, ‘Oh wow, they have a lot of cool strategies that they can use. And this is even more interesting than before.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four women who were victims of sexual misconduct by former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez penned a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow Friday in response to an external review committee report published last week on the circumstances that enabled Domínguez’s misconduct.
In 2019, Bacow charged the external review committee with investigating the conditions in the Government department and across the University that protected Domínguez — who had a history of sexual misconduct involving at least 18 victims over the course of four decades — and others with track records of misconduct.
In their letter, the women — former Government assistant professor Terry L. Karl, Government Ph.D. graduate Suzanna E. Challen, and Government concentrators Charna E. Sherman ’80, and Nienke C. Grossman ’99 — thanked Bacow for the public apology he issued to Karl alongside the report, but took issue with the review committee’s finding that existing procedures to investigative sexual harassment allgeations at Harvard are “adequate to redress faculty misconduct.”
“Harvard is unwilling to take upon itself the burden of holding powerful faculty members accountable,” the women wrote. "Simply, we have watched Harvard’s staff and procedures silence and harm victims, especially those who have suffered the most egregious conduct, including quid pro quo sexual harassment and sexual assault.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed that Bacow had received the letter, but declined to comment further.
The women also wrote that given Harvard’s recent handling of sexual harassment allegations — including within the Anthropology Department — they feel “unable in good conscience” to encourage women to use current procedures in the Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution to report misconduct by tenured faculty members.”
“The challenges the Anthropology complainants have confronted in pursuing their claims are appalling,” the letter reads. “[Harvard] fails to provide basic supportive measures to community members risking their professional futures to expose harassment and misconduct.”
In their letter to Bacow, the women acknowleged that the recent formation of internal committee and working groups composed of current students, faculty, and staff to review the University’s sexual misconduct, discrimination, and bullying policies are “a step in the right direction.”
“However, the direct input of individuals with personal knowledge and interaction with its procedures, including Title IX and ODR, is critical to their legitimacy and success,” the letter reads. “Allow our lived experience to help Harvard effectuate real change.”
Last fall, 12 women who accused Domínguez and two Anthropology professors of sexual misconduct requested seats on a new committee being formed to review the FAS’s interim sexual harassment policy.
In a separate emailed statement, Grossman — one of the women who requested a seat on the FAS committee — wrote that while she is grateful for the external review committee’s “important and thoughtful recommendations,” she believes that the report “misstates the reality of the current Title IX and ODR processes, which are wholly unsatisfactory in relation to tenured faculty misconduct.”
“I urge the University to include women who have been failed by these procedures in its efforts to improve them,” Grossman wrote.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview Monday that the FAS Title IX committee has begun soliciting feedback from Harvard affiliates, aiming to issue a final report later in the spring.
The external review committee report issued Thursday found that “pronounced power disparities” and “inadequate reporting mechanisms,” amongst other institutional failures, allowed Domínguez’s sexual misconduct to persist for decades until his retirement in 2018. An investigation ultimately led Gay to strip Domínguez of his emeritus status and bar him from the FAS campus in 2019.
The report also laid out 10 policy recommendations to foster a more inclusive and safe working environment. The recommendations included encouraging reports of misconduct, ensuring more effective responses when misconduct is reported, and vetting candidates for leadership positions.
Karl, in a separate emailed statement Monday, urged the University to take immediate action in addressing past failures and preventing future sexual misconduct on campus.
“Change is pushed by the bottom when it is not carried out by the top. Apologies, remedies to victims, justice, and memory are essential in building a better future at Harvard and in our world,” Karl wrote. “But if the past is to prove instructive, it must be fully revealed — or institutional cover-ups will continue.”

Feeling stressed about classes? Feeling anxious because that special someone you’ve been slyly eyeing hasn’t texted you back yet? Go with the flow below to help you determine the answer to the undeniably more important problem. It’s almost Valentine’s Day, who really needs a 4.0 GPA anyway!
Sections
Whether you’re a lifetime hopeless romantic or you’ve found yourself pining for love this pandemic, you’ve probably heard of The New York Times’ “36 Questions That Lead to Love". Through rigorous peer review (AKA the opinions of my two friends), I’ve adapted questions from this hallowed list for everyone’s new prime date locale: Zoom. Use these icebreakers the next time you’re tossed into a breakout room with classmates you’ve never met, stuck answering the same questions at your club’s weekly social, or maybe even trying to cuff your pset partner before Valentine's Day ;)
Instead of #28, try “Tell your pset partner what you like about them; be very honest, sharing answers that you might not say to others in your class.”
If you want this relationship to go beyond the class, be upfront and let them know your priority is them, not the assignment. Tell your pset partner you like how their well defined silhouette doesn't fade in and out of Zoom backgrounds. Or perhaps let them know they freeze attractively, even with their mouth half open or while buffering with eyes half-closed.
Instead of #27, try “If you were going to become actual friends with your breakout room buddy, please share what would be important for him or her to know.”
You’ve had them pinned to your screen every section, but now it’s time to make your move. If you want to ease into taking this friendship to the next level, you might want to make a plan for a future call before logging off. Or even schedule a three hour study date because that’s how long it takes you to watch a 45 minute lecture at 1.5x speed.
Instead of #21, try “What roles do private Zoom messages and heart reactions play in your life?”
Let them know if you’re the type of person with a custom Slack react for every person in your life, or warn them if you can’t help but put up the heart emoji 20 times during every call. Does it make your heart warm to know someone logged onto a call and searched your name on the participants tab? Does it make you giddy to see private Zoom messages that will inevitably lead to you stifling laughter in the middle of class?
Instead of #13, try “If a Harvard email could tell you the truth about Fall 2021, Zoom camera policies, the endowment, or anything else, what would you want to know?”
Maybe you’re still concerned about those private Zoom message transcripts, so you would ask if Zoom really protects your privacy. Or maybe you’re still trying to place your bets on a ~moderately normal~ semester next fall, so you really need Dean Gay to slide you the plan ASAP. Time to find out about your partner’s true priorities (or favorite Harvard conspiracy theories) so both of you can be on the same page.
Instead of #4, try “What would constitute a ‘perfect’ Zoom date for you?”
No Zoom. We should really give Google Hangouts a chance.
Now, you are ready for the final step: stare past your webcam’s blinding light right into your Zoom partner’s eyes for 4 minutes — the headache will be worth it when you’re one step closer to being featured in your class’s Wedding Bells. Let us know if these reduce the amount of insufferable silence on your calls, and perhaps even lead you to true love!<3
