After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The forest loomed, crested blue and deep in the distance, a fading moon was still in the sky and the pale light of morning rose silvery pink against the trees. The birds were beginning to wake and sing. The air was sweet and clear with the smell of pine and grass from our meadow…I ran fast because when you got going there was no more pain, even when your feet were bleeding.” It is in individual moments like this that Cara Hoffman’s third novel “Running” shines, as the best aspect of the novel is its elegant and virtuosic descriptions of the world through which her characters wander.
The novel, set initially in 1988 in Athens, follows Bridey Sullivan, a seventeen-year-old American girl who lives with Milo Rollock and Jasper Lethe, a queer British couple. The three work as “runners,” hustlers who bring tourists in from trains to cheap hotels and later steal their passports to sell. They spend most of their days reading, drinking, and having sex with each other, and much of the novel appropriately reads like an unrealistic daydrem. The novel is split into three time periods—the first takes place in 1988 in Athens and is told from Bridey’s perspective; the second occurs in present day New York City, where Milo is a poetry professor at the New School; in the third, Hoffman explores scenes from Bridey’s childhood in Washington State, where she was raised by a kind but emotionally distant forest firefighter uncle named Dare who prepares her to survive in the event of nuclear attack.
The three different temporal settings work well together to create a fascinating landscape of memories, but the disjointed way in which the novel is executed feels jarring. The setting switches at the beginning of almost every short chapter, which makes it difficult to keep track of crucial details that establish shifts in alliances between the characters, and the constant alternations break the building tension and make the climaxes feel oddly placid and alien. In theory this approach should work, putting present-day actions in the context of memories that might provide deeper psychological explanations. But each chapter feels too brief to let the reader find a foothold in the relationships between characters or to form a real bond with Bridey herself.
Because the relationships between characters feel underdeveloped, the most affecting parts of the novel are the moments in which the characters are completely alone. Hoffman sticks to plain speech—she simply states what the wandering character sees and smells and feels and does, but the effect is powerful. “Back where the trail met the sand there was a secluded depression beside some tall cedars. I dug a little camp, collected some brush and flotsam and set it on fire, sat naked on my shirt, smoking. My skin warmed, dried from the fire, and I dressed in the only other clothes I owned. Then lay near the flames, in the clear silence and slept.” Hoffman has a keen eye for unusual but recognizable details, and her assured and practical control of simple words  makes it easy to slip into the character’s shoes and see, smell, and feel the same things.
Hoffman so successfully simulates a completely immersive experience that it raises the question of whether this work might be better suited as a virtual reality video game than as a novel. Although Hoffman conjures up a vast and gorgeous world, the characters fail to earn much sympathy by the end, on the one hand because of the distractingly disjointed structure, and on the other hand because Hoffman is stingy with backstories that would explain much of the characters’ behavior at pivotal moments. Hoffman’s artistic choice to obscure their backstories has some aesthetic value in creating a mystical atmosphere. But the characterization ultimately feels unsatisfying, and Bridey, Milo, and Jasper feel locked away, perhaps behind an unwillingness to seem too melodramatic, too easy—too real. They could almost be avatars in a game, with vague, sweeping backstories of great hardship and sorrow. Although “Running” has its flaws in regards to its narrative structure and characterization, it works as an escapist plunge into a flighty world of sensations, surprise, and a good dose of nostalgia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A conference on universities and slavery brought Harvard’s extensive and long-obscured historical connections to slavery into sharp relief Friday, with some participants encouraging the University to consider monetary reparations.
The conference, entitled “Universities and Slavery: Bound By History” and sponsored by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, is the latest in a series of efforts Harvard has taken to confront its ties to slavery. A year in the making, the daylong event featured historians and representatives from several universities, and a keynote address by The Atlantic writer Ta-Nehisi Coates. University President Drew G. Faust announced plans for the conference in March 2016.
In her opening remarks, Faust called slavery “an aspect of Harvard’s past that has been rarely acknowledged and poorly understood.”
“Harvard was directly complicit in slavery from the College’s earliest days in the 17th century,” Faust said. “This history and its legacy have shaped our institution in ways we have yet to fully understand. Today’s conference is intended to help us explore parts of the past that have remained all but invisible.”
Repeatedly describing slavery and racial discrimination that arose from it as “plunder” in his keynote address, Coates urged attendees to recognize the scope of slavery and the “systems of plunder that haunt us to this very day.”
Coates, a famous proponent of monetary reparations, laid out that case for attendees Friday, arguing that progress on racial issues requires institutions to repay their debts to enslaved people.
“I think every single one of these universities needs to make reparations,” he said to wide applause. “I don’t know how you get around that, I just don’t. I don’t know how you conduct research that shows that your very existence is rooted in a great crime, and just say ‘well,’ shrug—and maybe at best say ‘I’m sorry’—and you walk away. And I think you need to use the language of ‘reparation.’ I think it’s very, very important to actually say that word, to acknowledge that something was done in these institutions.”
History professor Sven Beckert, who has previously investigated Harvard’s ties to slavery, opened a panel Friday afternoon by reiterating this message.
“We cannot successfully move forward as a university, as a nation, or as citizens, without acknowledging this history, and making it important to the understanding of our present,” Beckert said. “And to be meaningful, that acknowledgement will have to have economic and political consequences; it cannot be purely symbolic or rhetorical.”
In a question-and-answer session in the afternoon, an audience member asked Beckert if he supports Harvard paying reparations.
“There is a responsibility to address these past injustices and also to address them in material terms,” Beckert responded. “What this exactly looks like, I can’t tell. But I think the importance is to acknowledge this and then to have a conversation in a community—for example, a university community—to see what the proper steps are that should be taken.”
In recent years, universities across the country have begun to delve into their historical ties to slavery and take action in response. Emory University’s Board of Trustees released a formal statement of regret, Brown University dedicated a slavery memorial in 2014, and Georgetown University agreed to offer preferential admissions status to the descendants of slaves the university sold in 1838.
At Harvard, the process of unearthing this history began in 2007 with a seminar on Harvard and slavery led by Beckert. Over the ensuing ten years, Beckert’s students uncovered stories of the slaves who worked on campus under two Harvard presidents, donations from wealthy slave-owners, and endowment investments linked to the slave economy. One of Beckert’s students, who presented the findings of her senior thesis at the conference, found that Harvard used the Caribbean plantation of a formerly slaveholding benefactor as a research station until 1961.
Slavery shaped the intellectual history of Harvard as well. Professor Louis Agassiz conducted research to support polygenism—a theory that grounded racial differences in genetics—and the photograph of a South Carolina slave he studied as a specimen stared out at the audience Friday from the cover of the conference’s program.
But the piece of Harvard’s past that first galvanized students and brought Harvard’s connection to slavery into the national spotlight was encapsulated by the three sheaves of wheat that used to adorn the Law School’s seal. The sheaves formed the family crest of Isaac Royall, Jr., a Medford slave owner who derived his wealth from a sugar plantation in Antigua. Royall’s 19th century bequest helped establish the Law School in 1817.
In 2015, a group of Law School activists began calling for the seal’s removal—a request a Law School committee granted in March 2016. After approval from the Harvard Corporation, the Law School removed the Royall crest from its premises.
The movement sparked University-wide conversations about Harvard’s connections to slavery. In April 2016, Faust dedicated a plaque to the four enslaved persons who worked at Wadsworth House, and appointed the faculty committee to brainstorm and recommend further initiatives. A new exhibit at Pusey Library explores the relationship between Harvard and slavery, and Faust has pledged to provide funds for a researcher to continue looking into this relationship.
But Faust has stopped short of offering reparations. After Georgetown announced it would provide an admissions advantage for the descendants of former slaves, the ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda wrote a letter to Faust, calling on Harvard to offer preferential admission to Antiguans and provide funds to construct universities in Antigua—a proposal the University rejected.
In an interview in fall 2016, Faust said efforts like Georgetown’s program would not be appropriate for Harvard, since the University did not directly own slaves.
“I am not aware of any slaves that were owned by Harvard itself, and slavery was much less of a presence and an economic force in New England than it was in Washington, D.C., and the South,” Faust said. “Mostly slave records were kept as economic records, business records, and the records we have of slaves at Harvard are much scarcer and less complete.”
In Coates’s view, however, adequately recognizing a past tied to slavery requires some form of financial reparations.
“Let me be very clear about something: I do think it involves a payment of money,” Coates said in a conversation with Faust at the conference.
The faculty committee will continue to examine Harvard’s connection to slavery and plans to release a set of recommendations to the University, Beckert said in an interview with The Crimson Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—If it wasn’t a rivalry before, it certainly is now.
In a game with no implications for the conference tournament next weekend, but plenty of pride on the line, it came down to a single possession.
With just over five second left on the clock and the score tied at 69, Princeton guard Amir Bell drove left and threw up a layup over freshman forward Chris Lewis. The layup found the back of the net and for the second time this season the Crimson (18-8, 10-3 Ivy League) fell to Tigers (20-6, 13-0) on a last second shot.
“It was a hell of a play, I think it was Bell, who shot a lefty hook over Chris,” freshman guard Justin Bassey said. “Chris played great defense, but I think it was really good offense. We’d like to have it back, and a few plays here and there, but it was a really good play and there’s not much more we could’ve done.”
In a game that saw nine ties, six lead changes, and a margin that never went beyond nine, it was ultimately a late turnover and a missed rebound that gave Princeton possession for it’s last second win, 73-69.
With the score tied following a pair of Harvard free throws and just under a minute left on the clock, freshman guard Bryce Aiken drove inside and committed an offensive foul for what would be the Crimson’s 18th turnover.
Despite an initial miss by the Tigers’ Spencer Weisz from deep on the other end, Princeton came up with an offensive board to set up Bell for what is perhaps only another chapter in a budding Ivy League rivalry.
With the win, Princeton is officially the sole owners of the Ivy League regular season title, its first  since 2011 and its first outright title since 2004. For the first time however, that distinction means less, as the Ivy League regular season winner will no longer receive the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Instead, Princeton will enter next weekend’s inaugural Ivy League tournament as the No.1 seed, needing to win two games to get to March Madness.
FROM DEEP EARLY
For a Harvard team that thrives beyond the perimeter, Friday’s matchup took it to a different level. The Crimson’s first 18 points came off threes with Harvard going 7-of-14 from deep in the first period.
In total, 21 of the Crimson’s 32 first half points came from beyond the arc with freshman forward Seth Towns pouring in 14 points and 4 rebounds over the span. He finished the game with a season high 26 points and eight rebounds on 9-of-12 shooting from the field and 4-of-6 from deep.
“If we get into a rhythm of shooting it and shooting it well then we want to stay with it,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “But certainly we needed to get to the foul line a little bit more and needed to drive it a little bit more, but that’s easier said than done against their length on the perimeter and how sound they are defensively.”
In the second half, Harvard kept the threes coming. The Crimson would cut a nine point first half deficit in the span of a minute and on three shots from beyond the arc. In total the Crimson took 28 three pointers and connected on thirteen of them.
For its part, Princeton kept up with the Harvard on the perimeter early—in the first half the Tigers went 6-of-14 from deep. On the game, however Tigers took 26 shots from deep and connected on only eight.

TOUGH TURNOVERS
Behind the hot shooting the Crimson jumped out to a 6-12 advantage in the first. Despite the early lead for Harvard, however, turnovers gave Princeton easy baskets late in the half. In total the Crimson coughed up the ball 12 times in the first frame for a total of 13 points off turnovers.
For its part, Harvard only scored a single point off three Tigers turnovers in the same span.
“We started on fire a little bit at the beginning, and I think we wanted to play with great pace, but we weren’t under control a few times and sometimes that happens when you’re trying to play a faster pace game,” Amaker said. “But you can’t do that on the road and be out of control and I think we did that a few times and just turned it over and allowed them to get extra possessions and score points off our turnovers.”
Despite outshooting and outrebounding the Tigers through 20 minutes of play, the turnovers proved to be costly as Princeton entered the half up by nine.
The Crimson would overcome the deficit in the second half, but ultimately Bell’s shot would be the only one that mattered as Princeton took a last second from Harvard for the second time this season.
“You can’t say enough about how hard both teams played,” Amaker said. “All the kids were just tremendous on both squads. It was a possession game and it’s been nailbiting and I’m proud of our kids for the effort that we displayed here tonight and obviously Princeton is very good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

PHILADELPHIA—Jackson Donahue had played 12 minutes on Saturday night without taking a single shot. But in the 13th minute, the shot he did take was a big one.
With 20 seconds left, a trip to the Ivy League Tournament on the line for the Quakers, and the score knotted at 72, freshman guard Devon Goodman brought the ball up for Penn, looking to find classmate Ryan Betley for the game-winning shot. With Harvard anticipating a Betley look, Goodman pulled an audible and dished to Donahue.
The sophomore was stationed deep behind the three-point line in front of Penn coach Steve Donahue. With a clear view to the hoop, Donahue let one go that hit nothing but net.
Penn coach Steve Donahue acknowledged in the post-game press conference that at first he wasn’t thrilled with the shot selection, but knew as soon as it left Jackson’s hand that it was good. Jackson claims he knew it was good when he first received the pass from Goodman.
“That play down the stretch, it was a great designed play,” Jackson Donahue said. “We were sure someone was going to help somewhere and we were going to find whoever made that mistake [and] Dev found me.”
The bucket put Penn (13-14, 6-8 Ivy League) up 75-72, which would hold for the final score as Harvard sophomore Corey Johnson couldn’t connect on a last-second three.
“It could’ve gone either way, both teams had moments to stretch it out, but couldn’t do it and both teams came back and fought back,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It’s always been a tough place to play here on the road against Penn and they’ve been very good here….We just didn’t make enough plays to win the game.”
Harvard (18-9, 10-4) and Penn traded leads in the second frame, eventually leaving the game to the final minute. But this was nothing new for either squad.
Just 24 hours earlier, the Crimson fell to Princeton on a last second layup by Amir Bell. The first time it faced Princeton, it lost on a last second layup by Steven Cook. Of its four Ivy League losses, Harvard has fallen by an average of just 2.75 points per game, with last night’s four-point margin being the widest of any Ancient Eight loss for Harvard this year. The point differential in Penn’s last four games—two wins and two losses—has also been just 2.75 points.
Jackson Donahue hit the three, but Saturday was Matt Howard’s night. Playing on his senior night in his 100th career game with the Quakers, the co-captain was fighting to make sure this was not his last game at the Palestra.
Just minutes after standing center court with his family in celebration of senior night, Howard went off, scoring all of Penn’s first 11 points. Harvard stayed within striking distance, but the Quakers went almost 14 minutes without trailing.
The Crimson took the lead with 6:05 left in the first as freshman wing Justin Bassey dished to senior center Zena Edosomwan, who slammed it home to give Harvard a 23-21 advantage. Edosomwan finished with 15 points on 7-of-10 shooting from the floor.

Despite Howard’s dominance, the Crimson went into the locker room up four, as every Quaker except Howard was struggling to find the bottom of the net. As a team, Penn shot 36 percent from the floor in the first frame, but those not named Howard shot just 5-of-18. A trio of Harvard players each contributed eight points—Edosomwan, freshman guard Bryce Aiken, and freshman forward Robert Baker.
Coming out of the locker room, however, Penn got hot. After freshman forward Seth Towns added to Harvard’s lead with a jumper, the Quakers quickly erased the gap with a 10-0 run, earning a four-point lead. Penn’s AJ Brodeur spurred the run, starting things off with a tip-in and eventually scoring six of the 10 points.
Edosomwan ended the run with a layup, and senior co-captain Corbin Miller locked the teams at 42 with a three just over four minutes into the period. A minute later, Harvard once again took a lead off an Edosomwan dunk that stretched to six over the next four minutes.
After Howard hit a three with 5:42 left in the frame, Harvard never led, but it never let things get out of hand as the two teams traded baskets until the waning seconds.
With Harvard having clinched a spot in the inaugural Ivy League tournament two weeks ago and locking up the two-seed last weekend, the Crimson had nothing to gain in terms of standings from this game. Amaker, however, was not willing to take his foot off the gas in the team’s final regular season game.
“I thought we came with an idea and attitude that we were going to give it our best shot,” Amaker said. “We didn’t always perform up to the level that we needed to, but I thought our kids competed and played very hard and that’s what we should do when we put the uniform on, we take the floor.”

Remember back in elementary school (or middle school, depending on which state you’re from) when you first learned about fight or flight? Those two options when faced with a stressful situation seemed like polar opposites, but we’ve always liked to consider Harvard students quite innovative. So here we are. With a response that could easily be considered both fight and flight—pulling a fire alarm.
Today, Flyby is going to answer a question that has plagued Harvard since whenever fire alarms became a thing. Is pulling a fire alarm fight or flight? Let’s begin.
Fight
So if you don’t really use Facebook or speak to other people, the fact that Martin Shkreli came to campus last month might be news to you. Shkreli is infamous for hiking up the price of Daraprim, an HIV/AIDS drug, from $13.50 to $750 per pill. He’s also infamous for competing with the best of the best of internet trolls.
Shkreli was invited to campus to speak by the Harvard Financial Analysts Club, but before his talk could even start, someone pulled a fire alarm. Now let’s examine. Someone decided that pulling a fire alarm would be the best course of action to stop this controversial event. As purely petty people, we can respect the fact that someone wanted Shkreli and attendees to stand out in the rain for 30 minutes. This event alone really racks up the argument for why pulling an alarm is definitely a “fight” method.
Flight
Given the number of times that Harvard students have done this during exams, we’re surprised that it’s not included in the “What to do if it’s the night before your exam” section of student study guides. The best part about the fire alarm pulled during the EC1010B exam is that this has happened over and over and over again. We were all taught to leave dangerous situations, but apparently some students have taken this to heart more than others. Sometimes simply zoning out is not enough. Pull a fire alarm and you get to physically leave the exam. A big con of this method though is that a fire alarm is just an alarm. You have to go back eventually.
Winner
Fight. The winning aspect of this method is that people aren’t pulling alarms to leave the situation forever. People are just pulling alarms as an ultra-annoying “screw you” to whatever situation that they’re currently in. And even if you don’t like to pull fire alarms, that’s a concept we can all understand.

Currier House. As the only upperclassmen house with buildings named entirely after female alumni, feminism is not the only reason to be excited about Currier. If you see green—we're talking morph suits and speedos, not just lanyards and novelty hats—on housing day, then know that you are about to enter one of Harvard's most welcoming if quirky communities. Tree jokes abound in this Quad House which sits right at the Quad Shuttle stop and just across the street from the Mac Quad. We hear that ~suburban living~ treats Currier well. Expect to see some of the largest singles on campus as well as one of the best dining halls.
In terms of housing, you can't go wrong with Currier. Nearly all sophomores in the house will be rewarded with a single for their troubles, joined together with another single by a shared sink room, with proper bathrooms off the hallway. A few lucky people might also get a suite with a kitchen, common room, and bathroom.
We mentioned that Currier is one of the more, shall we say, "quirky" houses. Expect to see grown men and women strolling around in spandex suits the color of rain-forest green (or the ill advised neon green). Like most Quad houses, Currier boasts a tight knit community and a hotel-like living space, and is home to some of Harvard's most-used party spaces, including the Fishbowl, the Solarium, and the Ten-Man. To give you a glimpse at the life of an average Currier resident, the House's HoCo chair Cara Jacobson '18 sat down with Flyby:
Can you describe Currier’s community in a few words?
CJ: Diverse, enthusiastic, and welcoming. Mainly though, we’re enthusiastic. A lot of students in Currier are really excited about Currier events and even create their own. We have coffee house nights that students produce and perform in, which is so fun and so nice. We also have things like Currier cinema, which was established by Currier members, where we watch cool movies. People are really enthusiastic about making Currier house life fun and exciting.
What’s your favorite Currier event?
CJ: Currioke, for sure. It’s a stein (a party for the house) once a semester. It’s just karaoke, but so many people in the house get involved and participate with their blocking groups. It’s so much fun.
Where are the chill spots to hangout?
CJ: Definitely the Fishbowl, which is the lobby area. It can be chill but it can also be super hype. We have Heaven and Hell there, so it can become a dance floor, but it’s also where Currier coffee house and other steins happen. We also pool tables, ping pong, and couches. The Mousehole is really nice too, which is behind the Fishbowl.
Still not quite sure what to expect if you've been sorted into Currier? You can find an answer to most of your questions here:
What Housing Day traditions should we know about?
CJ: There will be a lot of green. There may or may not be people in green Speedos and morphsuits. Be excited when you see green! You’ll get a tour of the house at night, and then there will be a celebratory event. You’ll meet the dog Milly, who is a golden retriever who lives in Currier. You’ll also meet Woody Evergreen who is our house mascot, the tree. We’re really excited about trees in Currier. You can see it in our beautiful arboretum [in the dining hall].
What does a tree have to do with Currier House? 
CJ: I think the longevity of the tree: trees live for a really long time, and I think the friendships that you build here are long-term. Also, you have your roots in Currier.
If you had to compare life in Currier to a Disney movie, does one come to mind?
CJ: Hercules. You know the song “I Can Go The Distance”? Well, you can go the distance, and when you do, what you find is great.
Is what they say about Currier’s dining hall being the best true?
CJ: Absolutely. We have the best food on campus, objectively, because we don’t share a kitchen with any other house. It’s nice because other members of the Quad come to eat here too, so this is the meeting place for a lot of the Quad.
What do you wish you knew about Currier moved into the house?
CJ: I wish I knew how comfortable it is to live here, how homey it is. I feel like here I’ve found a home and somewhere where I’m completely comfortable on campus that I hadn’t found freshman year, and I don’t know if I could have found that in another house.
What's your favorite Currier house memory?
Sarah Angell '18: At the end of a stein a couple weeks ago, everyone went in a circle and sang “Country Road, Take Me Home” together. It was a really nice moment.”

Surrounding the Quad Lawn on all sides, you could say that Cabot is the heart and soul of the Quad. This house is known for its idyllic and spacious housing, with almost all residents getting a single. With Dean Rakesh Khurana and his wife Stephanie Khurana as the Faculty Deans, what more could you ask for? You’re bound to be featured on Kesh’s Instagram before the end of your first semester living in this house.
If you like your personal space, Cabot is the place for you. Expect a single, either off a hallway or part of a suite. And not only do you get a single, you get a single large enough to finally have space to get out of your bed without hitting a wall. Only a few unlucky sophomores will be in a double for one year, but never again—definitely cause to celebrate and lord this fact over your classmates who might've been sorted into Eliot House this year.
We asked HoCo chair Jack Deschler ‘19 for the low-down:
How would you describe Cabot’s community?
JD: Incredible, welcoming, open, amazing, friendly. I think our faculty deans—Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana—have really put a premium on creating this open and inclusive community and I think that the two class years above me in Cabot (current juniors and sophomores) really doubled down on that. It’s created a space where everyone feels welcome and everyone feels like they have a home.
What is it like having Rakesh and Stephanie as Faculty Deans?
JD: It’s really, really cool: You’ll just be eating brunch on a Sunday and suddenly Stephanie will sit down and eat her eggs next to you and it’s always a cool conversation. A lot of times Rakesh will be hanging out in Cabot Cafe, reading papers with all the other Cabot students. They’re super present in the house and it would be really easy to forget that he’s the Dean of the College because he’s so focused on making it feel like a home for everyone.”

In addition to Cabot Cafe, what are the other cool places to hang out in the house?
JD: Cabot has tunnels underneath all the buildings and the tunnels have lots of hidden gems. We also have our own theater—I believe the woman who started the A.R.T. actually lived in Cabot, so she got the theater off the ground. People obviously love Cabot dining hall. It’s super homey. I would describe it as a giant family room. Then Cabot also has a really nice gym, an art studio, and a dance studio, so we have everything that you could possibly want.
What’s your favorite Cabot tradition?
JD: My favorite tradition is probably Festivus, which is a big holiday party inspired by Seinfeld, where we literally burn grievances on the Quad Lawn afterwards. Last year Rakesh brought out his speakers and played 90s music, so people were sitting on the Quad Lawn around these fire pits, burning their grievances from the past year and singing along to 90s songs.
What's the biggest misconception about Cabot?
JD: It’s a Quad myth in general. People get really worried that the Quad is super far away from things. But the Quad is actually a lot closer to some class buildings than the river, and once you’re in the Quad (if you have a bike) you’re not very far from anything in reality.

Do you want to give a defense of the Quad in general?
JD: I have so many feelings on this. I think getting quadded was honestly one of the best things that happened to me at Harvard. Because you’re all up there together, you (rightly or wrongly) have this shared struggle that’s projected on you by the rest of the Harvard community and that brings people much closer together. I think the house communities that have been created are really incredible. I would argue that you’re not even paying a price to be up there because it ends up feeling not far from anything and you’re reaping a ton of rewards in the form of the community.
What’s your best Cabot memory?
JD: My favorite Cabot memory is an intramural game: It was the ultimate frisbee semifinals, we were playing Lowell across the river, and it was pouring rain that night. We all biked down, and there was a puddle across JFK that covered the whole street, so it was this huge experience just to get down there. But so many people showed up for the game and it was incredible to see the community. We got back to the house, we were soaking wet, and people were asking us how it went, and that was really great.
If you had to compare life in Cabot to a movie, does one come to mind?
JD: It’s almost like any cheesy 70s or 80s movie, where it’s kind of corny because everyone’s super friendly with each other. People are fist-bumping all the time, for sure.
Anything else we should know about Cabot?
JD: Cabot is the house with the highest piano to student ratio. Every pair of entryways has a Steinway in their common room.
