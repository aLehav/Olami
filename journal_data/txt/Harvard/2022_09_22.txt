After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MUNA is the greatest band in the world. At least that’s what the band — an acclaimed indie pop three-piece hailing from Los Angeles — wants you to think. It’s evident with their larger-than-life confidence (ironic or not), their unapologetically effervescent songs, and their relentless commitment to creating and performing. With their current fall tour well on the way after a kickoff show in Boston on Sept. 18, they’re sure to convince you of their stardom.
Made up of members Katie Gavin, Josette Maskin, and Naomi McPherson, MUNA has been the go-to band for electro-pop bangers since 2017, though they’ve been around for much longer. Their debut studio album “About U” under RCA Records pushes listeners to the deepest depths of their inner psyche and back again. Bellied by brutally honest lyrics and kaleidoscopic production, it explores love and heartbreak in tracks like “Everything” and “Winterbreak,” yet it also posits an alternative: a “place” where one can go to escape the difficulties of the world, even if just for a second. “I know a place where you don't need protection / “Even if it’s only in my imagination,” Gavin sings on the album’s debut single, one of the first songs she, Maskin, and McPherson wrote together.
In many ways, “I Know a Place” continues to be the band’s mantra. Its themes are present across MUNA’s discography, including the iconic “Saves the World” and a new self-titled record that meets and exceeds expectations for the queer icons. The call to action in the track brings with it an energy that drives MUNA’s concerts and engulfs them in an unmistakable air of community. MUNA shows are a place to let go, to dance and to sing, and to envision brighter, more loving alternatives to what life could be. Their performances are, to quote Gavin at the end of their Sept. 20 show in Washington, D.C., a "queerful joy revolution."
Sunday’s sold-out Boston show at the Royale was no different. With the help of openers Meet Me at the Altar, a refreshingly fiery punk band for the modern age, MUNA delivered an unforgettable performance rooted in care, fun, and, to quote Gavin, “horniness.”
The band’s stage presence is undeniable, and made the show feel like an intimate night spent with friends, rather than the massive concert it was. McPherson, Gavin, and Maskin danced together, teased each other, and bantered as though they were letting the crowd in on their many jokes. At one point during “No Idea,” “one of the horny ones” from MUNA’s latest album, Gavin and McPherson had a moment on stage inspired by the song’s lustful lyrics. After the song ended, Gavin turned to McPherson, incredulously, “I can’t believe you let me put my finger in your mouth … That was fucking crazy.”
Throughout the show, the trio made sure to hit all the right notes, playing songs from across their expansive discography, complete with a cover of the heavily-memed yet adored “Mr. Brightside.” Songs like “Number One Fan,” “Anything But Me,” and “Pink Light” were emotional highlights, showcasing the band’s endless capacity for joy and self-love despite— or even amid— heartbreak. Others, like 2017’s “If U Love Me Now,” which Gavin called “the saddest song in our entire discography,” showed how far the trio has come. But it was "Home By Now" that really sold the show. Maskin, McPherson, and Gavin took over the stage, making sure to reach every corner of the audience with the song's chorus, their fists in the air.
It’s been a big few years for MUNA. After a difficult pandemic year, they became the second artist signed to Phoebe Bridgers’s Saddest Factory Records in May 2021. Their first single on the nascent label, 2021’s “Silk Chiffon” with Bridgers, became a chart-topping hit and indisputable queer anthem. Now, their self-titled album, itself a sort of rebirth for the band, has set MUNA on their biggest headlining tour to date. “The last time we were playing venues this size, we were opening for other people,” McPherson said from their post on stage left. “It's so cool playing shows like this.”
That sentiment was shared by the band. Talking about how the show represented the first night of a months-long headlining tour across the U.S., Maskin shared that “it just feels so special.” At another point, she said, “we haven't played a show in a month and this is just the biggest welcome.” Indeed, the crowd at night one of MUNA’s two-night Royale residency was fervent, the roars of adoration nonstop. Some traveled in from out of state, some attended with their exes, and for many, it was their first time seeing MUNA on stage. The majority, though, knew the words to every song and enough about the band to laugh along with their inside jokes, a testament to the community of inclusivity the band has intentionally built.
MUNA is the greatest band in the world. They know it, and now Boston does, too.

This past week, New York Fashion Week hosted hundreds of runways, showcasing up-and-coming designers alongside established fashion houses in the U.S. Fashion Capital. While New York Fashion Week can birth many aspiring models’ careers, it’s always helpful if said model was already born to parents who can give them the industry connections to get a stilettoed foot in the door.
These lucky few are nepotism babies, and New York Fashion Week is crawling with them. Every runway seems to feature at least one. Some, like Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner, have succeeded in catwalking out of the shadow of their parents’ and siblings’ profiles to be taken seriously as models in their own right. Other newer faces to fashion, like Kaia Gerber, Sophia Richie, and Ella Emhoff, still have their families to thank for their quick rises onto the most coveted runways.
While having rich and well-connected parents has been among the most bankable paths to success in most celebrity professions for decades, nepotism and high fashion modeling are a match made in heaven. In the supermodel heyday of the ‘90s, the models’ appeal came not only from their long limbs and perfect pouts but from the illusion that anyone could be them. Cindy Crawford, arguably the preeminent ‘90s supermodel, was famously discovered by a local photographer while shucking corn during her summer job in high school. She dropped out of her first semester of college and soon found herself gracing the cover of Vogue Magazine.
This story struck the perfect alchemy of relatability and aspiration. Young people latched onto this Cindy-rella story and others like it because it started at such an accessible, quotidien place — remember, she was shucking corn — but quickly ascended to glamorous heights. Young people and media alike latched onto this narrative that anyone from anywhere could be a star with some luck.
With social platforms democratizing media, traditional media sources have lost control of pushing similar aspirational narratives. Now, many people fixate on stories that don’t instill hope but instead reinforce inequality. These rags to runways narratives have been replaced by the less heartening reality that, in order to succeed in modeling, you can’t just be a Cindy, you have to be her daughter.
It makes sense that modeling is filled with the daughters and sons of A-listers. Modeling is often far from financially sustainable, and when you’re paid in designer t-shirts and exposure instead of money, it helps to have parents that can supplement your income.
It’s disheartening to confront the reality that most celebrity-oriented professions are almost impossible to break into or profit from without the support of rich and famous parents. But it’s also demystifying: Isn’t it better that we at least know how the machine really works rather than clinging to handpicked, embellished origin stories that provide us with a false sense of proximity to celebrities? Maybe, with newfound clarity, young people will look beyond professions that have a history of underpaying and exploiting their workers.
Maybe, we should leave those lines of work to the Jenners, Hadids, and Gerbers (by way of Crawford) who don’t need the extra cash anyway.

On Sept. 13, Nintendo released a trailer for the long-awaited sequel to the acclaimed 2017 video game “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,” providing a much-desired teaser for fans eager to experience the next installment in one of the most beloved franchises of all time.
Since the first “Legend of Zelda” game was released in 1986, the series has continuously garnered acclaim from fans and critics alike. Prior to “Breath of the Wild,” games in the “Zelda” franchise followed similar gameplay mechanics. The protagonist Link travels through an overworld and various towns in order to reach a number of enemy-ridden areas called dungeons. In these dungeons, the user must solve puzzles and defeat strong foes in order to obtain key items. These items allow the player to progress to the end of the game in a linear fashion, with Link usually rescuing the titular princess Zelda or saving his kingdom of Hyrule in the process.
When development of “Breath of the Wild” began in 2013, however, the development team was not content with sticking to this formula. When creating the game, producer Eiji Aonuma stated that their mission was to “quite plainly re-think the conventions of ‘Zelda’.” In doing so, the team behind “Breath of the Wild” radically rehauled the series — a bold risk for such an iconic franchise.
Its typical linear progression of dungeons and story was entirely eradicated: “Breath of the Wild” allowed players to freely journey across a sprawling open world in any direction they chose. This created an unstructured and three-dimensional experience, rewarding players’ spontaneity and experimentation and even allowing them to immediately access the final boss.
With these profound alterations to the game’s fundamental mechanics, the game’s soundtrack had to likewise transform. In a slightly controversial move, a franchise long cherished for its memorable melodies and epic themes shifted towards a considerably quieter, atmospheric feel. Upon the release of the game, soundtrack composer Hajime Wakai stated that this decision was intended to properly reflect the game’s “areas of sparsity and density.”
Thus, the upbeat fanfare typical of the series’ overworld themes was replaced. The music of “Breath of the Wild”’s vast open world is scattered, usually consisting of short piano melodies and chords with long stretches of silence in between, in which the player only hears the ambient noises of the world: grass rustling, birds chirping. Locations that once had some of the series’ most upbeat tracks in other games now now had the minimalist backtrack of a Steve Reich piece.
This is not to suggest that the game’s soundtrack is entirely devoid of energetic melodies or grand moments. Quite the contrary: Theme songs throughout the game, from boss battles to towns are consistently memorable and fleshed out, with the game touting one of the most heroic final dungeon themes in the series’ history. But the composers for “Breath of the Wild” crafted its soundtrack in a manner that reflects the game’s desire to experiment and reject the comforts of traditional form. Nowhere is this more evident than in the game’s battle themes, which constantly utilize inventive rhythms and unconventional time signatures.
This inventiveness is the quality that makes “Breath of the Wild” such a special experience for long-time fans of the series and newcomers alike. By injecting fresh air into the “Zelda” franchise, the development team accentuated the series’ heart: Its love of exploration and adventure. This bold rehaul has also demonstrated itself to be impactful to other creative teams, with numerous significant games such as “Elden Ring” and “Ghost of Tsushima” citing it as a significant influence. Other beloved franchises such as “Pokémon” and “Sonic” have similarly experimented with looser gameplay mechanics and open world elements since “Breath of the Wild”’s release, suggesting that the game’s reinventions may be motivating for other long-running franchises, too.
Five years after its initial launch, the subtitle and release date for “Breath of the Wild”’s newest installment was announced. It will be called “Tears of the Kingdom,” and it will reach fans on May 12, 2023.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re reading this, you outlived Queen Elizabeth II.
On Sept. 8, Queen Elizabeth II, Britain’s longest-serving monarch, died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Reflections on her seven-decade-long reign ranged from cries of “good riddance” to hopes that she “rest in power.” Social media was dominated by posts mourning her passing, meme-ing her death, referencing “The Crown,” and reminding the world of Britain’s legacy of colonialism and discrimination.
However, the internet’s response to Queen Elizabeth II’s passing posed the questions: As technology has granted us increased access to the monarchy and more outlets to critique them for their oppressive and discriminatory actions, what is the “right” way to react? How can people react “properly” when they were informed through comically mournful tributes and controversial memes? Why must people express anything except disdain for the monarch of an empire which sponsored genocide, drove displacement, enslaved millions, exploited natural resources, and oppressed nations?
In order to understand the sincere, the shitpost, the cynicism, and the criticism, let's attempt to categorize each faction through their social media responses.
The first responses came in six hours before Queen Elizabeth II’s death was confirmed. Following Buckingham Palace’s statement announcing that they were “concerned” for the queen’s health, Facebook and Instagram overflowed with sorrowful tributes. The mournful adopted a black-and-white profile picture to honor Her Majesty’s greatness.
Cartoons depicting the queen reuniting with her husband and approaching heaven alongside Paddington Bear and her dogs broke the internet. Several prominent people posted wondering what effect this would have on her beloved corgis; don’t worry — the dogs are going with Prince Andrew.
The second group of responses are characterized by their preemptive nature. They served as a voice of reason attempting to persuade the public out of memeing the moment. British writers Ian Dunt and Ben Judah encouraged their followers to show “restraint” and consider how devastating the moment is for British people.
These posts, although popular, did not prevent the messy Twitter madness that the third group of responders created.
With safety in numbers, comedy co-opted this moment of grief and captured every social media platform's main feed. From tweets celebrating that this generation has “outlived the queen” to TikToks asserting that Queen Elizabeth II will be reincarnated as Trisha Paytas’ baby because Paytas was allegedly going into labor at the same time, the third wave was as controversial as it was creative.
The last group was the public scholars — the people critiquing the queen’s complicity in British colonialism and reckoning with Republicanism. Academic Twitter or Twitter-based intellectual discourse is dominated primarily by professors, academics, journalists, and students.
Uju Anya, a Nigerian-American language professor at Carnegie Mellon University, was among the loudest voices in a crowd of unapologetic critics. “I heard the chief monarch of a thieving raping genocidal empire is finally dying,” Anya tweeted on the day of Queen Elizabeth II’s death. “May her pain be excruciating.”
This thread initiated a contentious twitter war between Anya and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, in which Bezos condemned her statement repeatedly. While Carnegie Mellon released a statement deeming her tweets “offensive” and “objectionable,” the assertion Anya argued has been echoed by columnists at The New York Times and Washington Post, although theirs are slightly less graphic.
The days following Queen Elizabeth II’s death have revealed how drastically the global understanding of the monarchy has changed. Members of this millennium are comfortable criticizing powerful figures like the queen and satirizing solemn events like her passing. So while many people are genuinely mourning the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, a lot of people are not. The internet democratized access to being a hater — and gave room for those the monarchy has harmed to voice their discontents — but the question remains whether or not society can handle hearing all the voices in the room.
(In any case, this writer believes it's a better use of your time to donate to organizations helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Fiona.)

When a friend told me that Harvard’s course catalog does not contain a single course whose description references Winston Churchill, I couldn’t believe him. How could one of the primary actors in the second world war — arguably the greatest politician of the previous century — not merit a single mention in any Harvard course description? Yet when I entered “Churchill” into the course catalog search function, Winston Churchill did not surface once. Appalled, I tried “Napoleon.” Nothing. The only mention of Stalin was a course that references the “Stalin era.” “Dickens” and “Hardy” had no references at all.
I’d argue that these phrases — all of which can be found in the 2008 course catalog — are missing because Harvard’s courses have largely shifted to focus on progressive ideas. The transition is partly a long overdue correction of academia’s focus on white male authors and historical figures. Yet the attempt to study underrepresented groups has been accompanied by an abundance of left-wing scholarship, without a corresponding focus on conservative ideas.
Today, Harvard abounds with classes that develop the intellectual merit behind the political left’s ideology, including the theory of intersectional politics, progressive views on race and gender, and an approach to world history that centers on the conflict between oppressors and victims. Students can choose from a plethora of classes on social issues, including “Race and Ethnicity in the United States,”  “Queer Theory,” or “Decolonizing Global Health” to understand the ideas driving liberal politics today. However, a similar treatment of the ideology underpinning conservative ideas, like the value of tradition and the importance of small government,  is conspicuously missing from Harvard’s course offerings.
Take the Women, Gender, and Sexuality department, which the Student Handbook explains is based on the hotly contested premise that “gender and sexuality are fundamental categories of social organization and power that are inseparable from race, ethnicity, class, nationality, and other categories of difference.” The idea that an entire Harvard department would similarly embrace a highly-disputed belief in the right-wing end of the political or cultural spectrum is laughable.
The politicization of academia in recent years is not inherently bad. But when universities do not balance classes promoting progressive ideas with ones embracing conservative biases, liberal students become complacent with their beliefs, conservative thought becomes exiled to think tanks that lack the opportunity to teach students, and political discourse suffers.
Harvard’s mission statement claims the school strives to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society.” When the University provides students courses that affirm one political perspective while ignoring others, they forsake their purpose. While it’s a welcome, long-overdue development to include non-white, non-cisgender, and non-male voices that have traditionally been ignored, it’s a mistake to do so at the expense of examining beliefs stimulating conservative politics. The two are not incompatible: Let’s not allow needed reforms to introduce novel problems.
Beyond the imbalance plaguing Harvard’s courses, graduation requirements worsen the effects of the asymmetry. Harvard’s current curriculum, which affords students tremendous freedom in determining which classes to take, allows progressive students to coast through four years of their education at Harvard enrolling in classes that affirm their beliefs without prompting them to rethink their principles. Conservative students are similarly unlikely to seek out new perspectives, and will also enroll in classes that do not challenge their beliefs — they just have a smaller selection from which to choose. The curriculum serves no one because it never forces students to seriously confront new ideas.
The one-sided nature of teaching at Harvard and in academia generally is also harmful to our national political discourse. Conservative thinkers have been relegated to think tanks like the Hoover Institution, the Heritage Foundation, and the American Enterprise Institute, where they have less influence on young students. As a result, liberal students are less likely to understand conservative perspectives and students inclined towards right-wing ideologies may have a shallower understanding of their political beliefs than their liberal peers.
If Harvard seeks to educate the citizen-leaders of our society, it must contend with a simple, basic, irrefutable fact: Although conservative people are a minority at Harvard, they are the plurality in America, and depriving the next generation of conservative perspectives will only worsen political dialogue. Educating our future citizen-leaders means educating students in both leftist and conservative world views: Students on both sides of the political spectrum will leave Harvard and become leaders in our country and around the globe. Given that many American lawmakers from both parties once studied at this school, Harvard should provide an education that serves our future leaders regardless of political orientation.
To properly educate its students, Harvard should offer more courses that apply a conservative lens to history and literature in the same vein that some classes explore these areas through a progressive framework. It should also redesign its graduation requirements to ensure that each student is forced to take classes with both openly progressive and conservative biases in addition to courses that aim for objectivity. Forcing students to take courses that challenge their beliefs will simultaneously encourage individuals to rethink and nuance their opinions, while also introducing them to foreign ideologies they have not yet considered. In an era of rampant polarization, Harvard should foster mutual understanding between students of various ideologies in the classroom.
Being an educated person today means understanding the salient political movements that are animating contemporary debate. Harvard’s task ahead involves creating new classes and altering the College’s graduation requirements to ensure students enroll in classes that acquaint them with both liberal and conservative ideas. Although these reforms will require much time and energy, this issue is too important to ignore: The blinkered liberal hold on Harvard’s academics must be relaxed if the school hopes to promote an honest and open discussion of ideas.
Our future citizen leaders are here — it is now time to begin educating them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During much of the year, you won’t find Cantabrigians — residents of this frequently dark and frosty town — complaining about the heat. But from May to mid-October, it’s hot and humid in Cambridge. And it’s only getting hotter.
Opening the windows does little to circulate the stagnant air of my third-floor Westmorly bedroom. While hot dorms might seem inconsequential, sweltering suites carry consequences. Comfortable indoor temperatures enhance learning in two ways: by improving sleep and long and short-term educational achievement. Harvard must keep this in mind now and while renewing the Houses. The College should allow personal air conditioning in undergraduate housing, and incorporate central, building-wide air conditioning in renovated Houses.
Extreme temperatures have negative impacts on sleep, performance in the classroom, and overall health. And campus is getting hotter — Boston set multiple heat records this summer, reaching almost 100 degrees in early August. In dorms with bad ventilation, the indoor temperature can remain hot throughout the night. Not only do people with sleep disorders sleep better at lower temperatures, but people who sleep in warm environments also experience elevated stress hormone levels. Cooler temperatures also increase metabolism, which can help people maintain a healthy weight.
Regulated temperatures in dorms are especially important in the post-Covid era, given that some courses, research projects, and many job interviews remain completely virtual — meaning students are spending substantially more time inside, exposed to unpleasant temperatures. High school students learning and taking exams at high temperatures perform worse, both on the particular exams and over their cumulative high school careers, demonstrating the short and long-term effects of unregulated temperatures. Even if exams at Harvard are held in air-conditioned spaces, consistent learning in an uncomfortably warm environment can still lead up to inferior exam performance.
House building managers and Yard-ops cite several reasons to disallow window air conditioners, from the potential fire hazard to electricity consumption. However, these concerns are outdated. Fire hazards are not the worry they once were because many new styles of personal heating and cooling units are much safer than previous models. If building managers are still concerned, they could check that portable units are properly installed, instead of banning them altogether. While it’s true that both personal heating devices and air conditioners use significant amounts of electricity, modern portable air conditioners have significantly reduced power consumption — some use just five times the power of the College-approved minifridge offered by Harvard Student Agencies.
Window air conditioning units must be allowed in College housing, but they are not an ideal long-term solution. Central, building-wide air conditioning must be installed in renewed Houses. To be clear, air conditioning should be available in all student rooms, not just hallways and public spaces like the House library or dining hall. Central air conditioning is more equitable, too: Every student should have access to air conditioning, not just those who can afford a window unit. The upgrades will likely use more electricity, and they won’t be cheap. But the improvement in student health and comfort is well worth the cost.
Regulated temperatures are not only a matter of comfort but also educational achievement and health and safety. The College should not sacrifice the health, academic potential, and comfort of its students to save on energy costs. The advantages of regulated temperatures are great. The College must invest in central and building-wide air conditioning in the renewed Houses. For now, a (verboten) window unit will have to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past July, The Crimson released the fifth installment of its Harvard faculty survey, diving (not so deep) into our professors’ ideological leanings. For the umpteeth time, and perhaps to no one’s surprise, the vast majority — 82 percent — of respondents identified as “liberal” or “very liberal.” Only 1 percent of respondents identified as conservative; exactly zero faculty members chose the “very conservative” label.
The talking point seemed, for once, to match reality: Academia was festering with liberal bias. An elated Fox News ran a feature on the poll (never, rather rudely, crediting The Crimson by name); a National Review columnist used the survey to argue that conservative perspectives in the country were being “ignored” or “routinely trashed.”
But does our faculty's ideological slant represent a genuine, practical problem?
For Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield, the answer is a resounding yes. Mansfield, who fancies himself one of the last conservatives on campus, has argued at length that the lack of conservative voices on campus poses a serious issue. In Mansfield’s eyes, his colleagues are either oblivious to how “Harvard is mocked by half the country” for its public and gratuitous ideological bias or willing to self-censor their views to fit in. The resulting absence of conservative voices poses, in his view, a substantial obstacle to both Harvard’s “impartiality and its devotion to veritas.”
We emphatically agree with Mansfield that debate and discourse are central to a vibrant intellectual community: Productive disagreement is the lifeblood of academia. Exclusive, unfounded adherence to any academic orthodoxy runs counter to our pursuit of veritas. Where our board disagrees with Mansfield — and rather sharply, we may add — is in his notion that a more even distribution of faculty along a conservative-liberal binary would increase productive disagreement in any meaningful way.
We find little reason to believe that. In fact, boiling down ideological and intellectual diversity to such limited labels strikes us as downright reductive.
At first look, the overwhelming majority of faculty identification as “liberal” or “very liberal” can be misleading, not least because less than a third of all faculty members fully completed the survey. These statistics suggest, on some level, that the majority of Harvard faculty agree on most if not all issues — that they all checked exactly the same boxes on some sort of ideological test. Such an interpretation is far from the case: While some degree of overlap is likely, self-identifying with a particular label hardly entails complete ideological symmetry. Disagreements in practice, if not on paper, are common, particularly when the labels span such broad political swaths. Options like ‘very liberal’ pigeonhole varied perspectives, funneling everything from hardcore Democrats to anarchist thinkers into a single monolithic identity.
Moreover, even professors with parallel political views might find themselves at odds in debates that are more directly related to their field: unwilling to disagree on abortion rights but eager to dispute the other’s interpretation of some empirical paper or set of data. Not all intellectual conflicts occur on the conservative-liberal — or, to all effects for American political media, Republican-Democratic — axis. The labels employed by the survey are limited in nuance and content; the relevance of our faculty’s concentrated selection of some over others is thus only limitedly revealing.
It is not this concocted notion of “diversity” we should concern ourselves with, but rather the actual quality and quantity of rigorous on-campus debate. In order to have open and honest discussions, individual opinions should be judged on their merits, not by the labels of those who hold those views. Therefore, we should assess our campus climate by how well it lives up to our institutional mission of truth and scholarship. Can students and faculty engage with one another’s ideas substantively, candidly, and constructively? Do our disagreements reflect genuine attempts to find answers? Can we take individual ideas seriously without conflating them with entire ideologies?
If conservative faculty feel undervalued or dehumanized by their peers in a way that affects their scholarship, that is an unquestionable problem. We find little evidence beyond Mansfield’s generic complaints that such a situation is actually the case; still, it should be seriously engaged with, lest our group biases render us excessively dismissive.
That doesn’t mean that Harvard ought to go on a hiring spree through red America on some wild goose chase for “political balance.” When Harvard seeks professors and guest speakers, its institutional obligation should be to reach out to those who are at the forefront of their fields and can contribute substantially to our intellectual community. It is not, by any means, obligated to satisfy some absurd ideological quota for the sake of avoiding clickbait headlines about “left-wing bias.” Mansfield's suggestion that the University select Commencement speakers of conservative leanings every other year strikes us as bizarre and unnecessary, a prioritization of intellectual difference over quality.
Novel and diverse perspectives are inherently essential to generating academic excellence, but there is no merit in being contrarian simply for the sake of it — those who forsake truth and good faith to argue the pseudo-scientific basis for racism, misrepresent historical facts, or deny climate change do not further Harvard’s mission of Veritas. Our campus and our truth-telling mission have no use for climate change deniers anymore than they have for Holocaust deniers.
We — professors, students, and community members alike — all have a role to play in cultivating a space for the intellectually challenging, good-faith discussions we want to participate in. Our campus culture is what we make of it. Instead of falling into the trap of labels, hear ideas for what they are — and make sure to probe them sharply.

James Hamlet Bolt Easton, class of 1883, had been a shoe-in for anchor four years in a row. There had been other anchors before him, and there would be anchors after him, but by 1887, Easton — known to be physically imposing even among athletes — had proved his reputation as a straight pipeline to victory for Harvard’s collegiate tug-of-war team.
Though tug-of-war is reserved for summer camps or family reunions today, it used to be a fiercely competitive sport, played at the collegiate and even Olympic levels. An 1887 Crimson article traces its history from its origin with sailors and navy men to its former place in the world of collegiate athletics, referring to the sport as “the most eagerly awaited event on the programme of a college athletic meeting.”
At the time, Harvard’s tug-of-war team was known as “the champion team among colleges,” according to an 1887 article in MIT’s newspaper, and had gone undefeated except for “one blot on their scutcheon.” On an unsuspecting day in March, the Harvard team’s undefeated record — and Easton’s ego — took a hit from an unlikely challenger: MIT’s ragtag tug-of-war team.
Easton, a law school student — not an unheard of addition to college athletics at the time — was credited with much of the Harvard team’s success during his 1883 to 1887 stint. Hailing from Minnesota, Easton was a Renaissance man of an athlete, lending his skill to the first Harvard lacrosse team and the second Harvard football team. But what he would become most known for was his role as tug-of-war anchor.
In tug-of-war, the anchor stands last in line and secures the rope. The term has also been utilized in other athletic contexts to indicate the fastest or strongest person on a team. According to an 1887 Crimson article, many strategic maneuvers used to gain an advantage in tug-of-war relied on the competence and action of the anchor.
Based on surviving records from Harvard’s archives, the fanaticism associated with the sport’s brief success seemed to have been foregrounded by Easton’s contribution. A December 1886 article reprinted from the Boston Herald described a match in New York in which “the Harvards were lying at ease on the plank, Easton alone keeping his hands on the rope.”
By contrast, the team from MIT that Harvard faced in March of 1887 had none of their prestige. Consisting of only four members and 10 pounds underweight, they had assembled at the last minute and entered the competition with only three hours of total practice and training. And they were gearing up to face a team made up of members with recent memories of victories at Mott Haven, the highly spectated New York intercollegiate competition that took place each year.
Perhaps Easton’s cleats failed, perhaps the Harvard team tried some trick maneuver out of arrogance that cost them the rope, or perhaps they weren’t as good a team as their fans on the Crimson thought they were. It’s not clear what happened in that match, but MIT managed to pull the rope two and half inches to their favor.
In the March 17 edition of its newspaper, an MIT reporter upheld the victory as “the greatest athletic feat which the Institute has ever accomplished.”
The Crimson’s article, published a few days later, took a more matter-of-fact tone: “We sent in four of our strongest men to pull against Technology, and we were fairly beaten.”
Still, the defeat caused contention among sports spectators. The article also makes reference to another previously published opinion, which the March 24 one referred to as “both extremely infantile in his arguments and ungenerous to ward [sic] the ‘Tech’ team.”
It’s not clear whether the Harvard team suffered any personal or public loss of reputation, but by January 1889, only 11 out of 300 freshmen tried out for the team. By 1891, Harvard and many other colleges had ended their tug-of-war teams altogether, presumably due to prolific injuries, contentious results, or an unsustainable smorgasbord of options for athletic participation.
As for Easton, who graduated after the 1887 season, he had driven himself to the point of near death with overwork throughout the course of his college athletic career. After college, his interests shifted as he embraced music, then race horse breeding, and eventually moved south seeking the solace of a different pace, growing citrus and sugar cane in Florida. There he died in 1921, at the age of 62, just a year after the Olympics officially removed tug-of-war from its roster.

On an afternoon in late September, Danehy Park has the calm of an open plain. Joggers and dog walkers amble; a few teenagers lounge by the track. Commercial sprawl adjoins the west side of the park; the east is lined by one of the wealthier neighborhoods of already-wealthy Cambridge; and to the south sit mixed-income affordable housing apartments.
In the center of the park, Maya Dutta is tending to the park’s 4,300-square-foot Miyawaki forest, which will turn a year old on Sept. 25. Dutta is bubbly and prone to rhapsodizing about the plants, some of which have already outgrown her — though, she points out, “I’m not that tall — I’m 5-foot-2.” She works for Biodiversity for a Livable Climate, a Cambridge-based nonprofit that advocates for biodiversity as a solution to the climate crisis. She is project manager for the Danehy Park Miyawaki Forest, a collaboration between the nonprofit, the city of Cambridge, and a Swiss forestry organization called SUGi Project.
If you decided to dig a hole 100 feet into the ground below the Miyawaki forest, a certain history would emerge. At the very bottom of that hole would be glacial bedrock, hundreds of thousands of years old. Just above it, you’d see a deep divot into a layer of clay, excavated by the New England Brick Company between 1847 and 1952. In the 19th century, according to the Cambridge Historical Commission, North Cambridge was dotted with “muddy claypits, smoky kilns, and vast drying sheds”; the New England Brick Company advertised a “Harvard”-style brick, burnished and water-struck like those in the Yard. Once construction and brick production in Cambridge slowed, the site became an industrial landfill. Fifty years worth of household refuse fills a thick layer beneath the surface of the park.
In 1971, the landfill was closed, sealed, and used as a staging ground for the extension of the MBTA Red Line through Alewife. In 1988, the city began to establish a park on the site. One of the first of its kind in New England, the “recycled” park was opened to the public in 1990; in the 22 years since, Danehy has maintained its status as the largest public park in Cambridge.
The “pocket” forest is designed according to the principles of the late Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, who recommended densely planting species native to their region. When planted alone, trees can’t build rich networks with other plant life; Dutta points to a solitary leafless maple several yards away as an example. But in tandem with other plants — and with a few years of maintenance following planting — hearty systems emerge. While the City Forestry department aims for a 90 percent survival rate among its trees, the Danehy Park Forest has only lost two percent of its plants in the last year, according to Andrew Putnam, the city’s superintendent of forestry. As the forest grows and the landfill’s waste inevitably permeates the barrier above it, the soil will help break down the refuse, adding its own layer of history to the patch of land.
Before that industrial waste was introduced, before the Brick Company, the Massachussett and Pawtucket peoples were the stewards of this land. They actively managed robust forests and closely studied the properties of local plants. The project of “reforesting,” as it is often called, is fraught; a “return” to forestry often neglects the long history of Indigenous care for Northeastern land. In an attempt to address this, the forest’s planners collaborated with local tribe members and Marylee Jones of the Yakama Nation to ensure that Danehy’s Miyawaki forest features a variety of native plants. Dutta hopes that as these projects expand, more Indigenous people will have central roles in the nurseries that supply these plants.
On this particular day, Dutta is measuring the heights of the forest’s trees. She is unsurprised to find they are shorter than projected the year before. As Dutta says, “The particular heat and dryness of this summer was not predicted.” Cambridge has endured a drought since mid-June; since July 21, it has stayed at a “critical” level. Putnam says that through the summer, all of the city’s water trucks were watering 12 hours a day and sometimes even through the night “to try to get through the worst of it,” he says. The forest also suffered, partly because the irrigation system in Danehy Park broke in late August. Yet only a few weeks after the heat wave subsided, the trees now appear sprightly and green.
Dutta imagines that forests like this one will become more crucial as the climate crisis intensifies. Miyawaki forests can be as small as 1,000 square feet or, as Dutta puts it, the size of six parking spots. “Take your parking lot, depave six parking spaces and turn it from hot, congested asphalt that doesn’t support anything [...] into something living,” she says.
In cities like Cambridge, urban heat islands will become more prevalent as global temperatures rise: Areas without much plant life become hotter, demand more energy use, and concentrate air pollutants. These areas, Dutta adds, tend to be clustered in poorer neighborhoods. A few parking spots’ worth of forest could, simply put, make these neighborhoods more livable.
As we circle the forest, Dutta says that one of her favorite parts is how it sounds: alive and buzzing. Dragonflies and monarch butterflies flutter overhead. Sumac, chokeberry, and elderberry grow in the underbrush. In November, a smaller Miyawaki forest will be planted in Green-Rose Heritage Park. The next summer, too, is projected to be hotter than the last. Will this young forest have time to grow?

“Why do you say ‘the’ like that?”
The question, coming from my friend’s mouth as we stood in line to enter our first grade classroom, seemed simple enough. Yet as the post-recess din around us began to fade, I just stood and blinked, taken aback.
“The? The?” I offered, my cheeks heating up.
“You’re saying it like ‘duh.’ It’s the,” she corrected me, spittle flying from her tongue.
“The,” I repeated. I thought about the the’s I’d grown up hearing from my parents, whose voices had always felt like home. Were we getting even this most fundamental word wrong? A sense of shame began to take root in my stomach, a seed of understanding planted: We’re outsiders. 
***
Though I grew up with both Mandarin and English, I primarily spoke Chinese or Chinglish at home. As I set down my backpack after school, I would chatter away as my mom asked me questions about my day. Our family dinners were always animated with conversations about everything from my sister’s social life to the news. Mandarin played such a core part in our lives that I took Saturday language classes from preschool to eighth grade and two years of honors Chinese classes in high school. But I spent most of my childhood and early adolescence trying to distance myself from the language.
Despite growing up in a predominantly Asian community in the Bay Area, I never felt at ease embracing my Taiwanese identity. I remember boys putting on exaggerated Chinese accents and laughing at them. I remember peers at my Saturday classes making ching-chong jokes. I remember a Chinese boy in my second grade class picking up a piece of nian gao (steamed rice cake) my mother made for our school’s culture week, wrinkling his nose, and saying loudly enough for my mom to hear, “Eww, what is this? It looks like poo.”
I remember the boys around him giggling.
Perhaps these were instances of ingroup joking; perhaps it was internalized racism. Perhaps both. Regardless, I grew deeply self-conscious about my identity — and by extension, my accent, my flagrant Asianness. Was I supposed to suppress and mock those parts of me, the way that my Asian peers did? Could I ever fit in if my own voice screamed foreign?
I wanted nothing more than to strip my tongue of the tang of Mandarin, but how could I do that when it was inseparable from my home? I didn’t even hate the language itself. I just hated the way it seeped into my English and hated what, to my peers, it stood for.
***
Soon enough, English became my language. As I blossomed as a writer, I unearthed new ways to turn everything I thought and felt into art — art that people appreciated, art that made me feel not just included but admired.
My brain still defaulted to Chinese when speaking with my parents, but increasingly, I found it easier to express myself fully in English. On birthdays and holidays, I wrote my parents cards in English, cards that my mother in particular struggled to understand, whose meanings I doubt she ever truly extracted. And when I was upset, I spoke in rapid-fire English, completely abandoning any effort at Chinglish.
At a rate that neither of us could keep up with, I spiraled farther and farther from being able to communicate with my mom. I grew impatient when I would speak to her in English, only to have to repeat myself because she couldn’t follow everything I said. I made passive-aggressive corrections when she grasped for the right words.
And while I recognized how disrespectful and arrogant my actions were, I remained too proud to admit it or to stop them.
***
Our conversations grew confusing and tense. I never knew what my mom misunderstood, and she never knew how I’d react if she asked for clarification.
In high school, in the middle of one of those trivial-turned-serious arguments, she finally turned to me and said, her voice a blade, “Can I be honest with you?”
She glanced away at her bedroom floor.
“I really hate the way you speak to me sometimes. When you talk in English, I don’t understand maybe 40 percent of what you’re saying because you talk so fast, and it takes time for me to process what you’re saying. But I usually nod along because you get so impatient when I ask you to repeat yourself, and I” — a tear rolled down her cheek — “I just feel so stupid,” she croaked. “I know it’s my fault I haven’t tried hard enough to learn English. But it just gets harder and harder as I get older.”
The tears I’d kept at bay for the past hour finally streamed down my cheeks. To see my mom, one of the sharpest and most assured women I know, in tears — and to know that I caused them — devastated me.
Between sobs, I delivered as much of a rambling apology as I could. I didn’t try to explain myself. It didn’t feel right.
“It’s OK,” my mom murmured as she hugged me. “It’s OK.”
But I didn’t think it could just be OK; I had to make it OK.
Slowly, I began paying more attention to the words coming out of my mouth, actively reigning in the fast-paced, English-speaking side of me. I tried to think about whether I actually knew how to say something in Chinese, and if I did, to say that instead. I started texting my parents and writing cards to them in Chinese, which required several drafts, white-out, and heavy dictionary use.
My efforts, especially when it comes to how I talk, aren’t perfect; linguistically retraining your brain, as my mother told me and as I’m always learning, is hard. But my mother seems more at ease when we talk. Save the occasional writing errors, she can fluidly read the cards and messages I write for her — and I get the sense that, even with my clumsy Mandarin, even when I feel like I’m not expressing myself as well as I could have in English, she picks up on every sentiment I’m trying to convey.
For my mother, learning English is a matter of survival, of getting by in this world. Mandarin, by contrast, provides her with a home. When I pause to think about how to say something in Chinese or rewrite a character for the third time, I try to tamp down the frustration that instinctively rises. I remind myself that this is how I offer her refuge.

When you think about public health, a recording studio may not be the first place that comes to mind, but The Record Co. was generous enough to give its space for a community conversation about disparities in healthcare last Friday. Several of the panelists were Black women, reflecting the diversity of the audience. An image of a smiling Black family lit up the screen behind them.
On September 16, the Boston Medical Center hosted “The Power of Now: Combating Health Inequity,” a panel discussion on healthcare disparities in maternal and mental health in underserved communities. At the panel, BMC President Kate E. Walsh, VP of Mission and Associate Chief Medical Officer Dr. Thea L. James, VP of Community Engagement and External Affairs Patrine M. Cherry, Psychiatrist Dr. Christine M. Crawford, and BMC Program Manager Giavanna A. Gaskin shared their experiences working to close racial disparities in health and their visions of the future.
The panelists talked about the systemic distrust of healthcare systems within communities of color, stemming from a history of racist practices, from James Marion Sims’ nonconsensual experiments on Black women and the U.S. Public Health Service’s unethical Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to the stealing of patient Henrietta Lacks’ cancer cells and the perpetuation of myths like Black people’s higher pain tolerance.
Boston Medical Center works to address these issues through programs such as the Health Equity Accelerator, which was launched in 2021 as Covid-19 made the racial and economic disparities in health more apparent. The project aims to eliminate racial gaps in life expectancy and quality of life by bringing together “leading-edge research methodologies, patient insights and community partnerships, and clinical operations capabilities” according to BMC’s Health Equity Report. The Health Equity Accelerator targets access barriers such as lack of transportation as well as structural issues like lack of economic resources.
In terms of resolving access barriers, Gaskin described one program that sends patients home with blood pressure cuffs. This allows nurses to monitor them remotely using a feature that enables them to exchange messages. Gaskin says this program is important not only to help with blood pressure management, but also to build relationships with nurses. With this relationship comes a more open line of communication, potentially helping patients  feel more comfortable opening up to nurses with other issues, such as lack of transportation which might affect their ability to get to appointments or pick up medications. Once these issues are identified, Gaskin says, BMC has worked to find solutions such as partnering with pharmacies in the area to get medication to clients.
In terms of addressing structural issues, one of the Health Equity Accelerator’s major projects is the Boston Opportunity System Collaborative, a partnership with hospitals and local organizations to create jobs and affordable housing in the community.
These opportunities at improving economic flexibility empower people to make their health a priority, by giving them resources that make survival easier, says James. “It all comes down to economics. They can’t prioritize their health when they are prioritizing survival.”
BMC and the Health Equity Accelerator are also working to break down the distrust of healthcare systems that exists within communities of color by recognizing the importance of centering community. BMC has collaborated with community-based organizations to facilitate conversations and advisory committees, so that people can have a say in what solutions best suit their needs.
Throughout, the panelists stressed that solutions cannot be effective without the input of the community, as they are the ones who understand what is needed to improve their lives.
“Nothing about us without us,” Cherry says. “Those closest to the pain and the problem should be closest to the solutions.”

On a typical Monday summer evening at the Smith Playground in Allston, creatively costumed skaters from around Boston descend on the street hockey rink. They are there to build skate skills and community as part of a larger Boston-based movement to create affirming spaces for people of all skill levels to get on wheels.
Lonely Bones Skate Co. and Skate Hags, both founded in 2020, are two skate groups working to combat white, cisgender, and male media stereotypes to make it clear that everyone belongs in the sport.
Lonely Bones, Boston’s first queer- and BIPOC-led skate collective, was founded by Claire I. Lee and her friend Rayven D. Tate, who were both inspired by the women-led collectives of the vibrant West coast skateboarding scene.
“I noticed that there were some gaps that I felt like weren’t fulfilled,” Lee says. “I think queer people, trans, gender non-conforming people, and people that don’t necessarily identify as women aren’t really seen in skate media or feel comfortable at skate parks. I think there was a big gap there in not only representation but in leadership.”
This sentiment seems to have resonated in Boston and beyond. About 80 people from the New England area showed up to the collective’s first event.
“We were so ill-prepared because I was like, ‘Oh, ten people are gonna show up,’” recalls Lee, “and from there it just really went fast.”
Just two years later, Lonely Bones events now draw up to 200 attendees. During the skate season — whenever there’s no ice and snow on the ground — they host at least two scheduled events per month, one “standard skate” meetup and another that incorporates other art forms, such as fashion and music. Their goals are to meet everyone where they are, helping those new to the community get comfortable with skate culture without having to dive in head-first and to build connections across creative spaces.
This summer, Lonely Bones held a vintage pop-up in collaboration with Bullshit Boutique, a local thrift store. They’ve also done clothing swaps, hosted bands and vendors, and partnered with brands like Converse.
Lonely Bones’s commitment to inclusion extends beyond the skate rink. They’ve facilitated fundraisers for organizations like Black and Pink Massachusetts, which advocates for prison abolition and LGBTQIA2S+ liberation, and Trans Resistance MA, which uplifts the “joy, safety, and liberation of QTBIPOC.”
“There’s a lot of beautiful things that can come from skaters interacting more with adjacent communities and artists and musicians, because there’s a lot of overlap there.” Lee says. “Sometimes I think of skateboarding as more than just skateboarding and almost like an art form and a vessel for self expression.”
Skate Hags, another queer-led group, was founded by long-time friends Jennifer M. Millis, Octavia D. Bennet, and Jennifer C. McMahon.
Initially just a trio of avid roller skaters looking for a place to practice, the group started small and put out an open invitation for locals to join them in a church parking lot in Waltham. It was there that they chose their name, reclaiming a historically insulting term.
“The term ‘skate hag’ is a slur that used to be used against women who would like to hang out at skate parks,” says Millis. “It suggested that they weren’t there to be cool and skate, they were there to try to get dudes. That was very funny to us and not ever what we were trying to do.”
Skate Hags has since expanded to host themed Monday-night skate sessions at Smith Playground with themes like pajamas and fruit. When the weather gets cold they move to The Edge, an indoor skate park in Taunton.
“The idea is just to have fun. If you want to dress to the theme, please be very creative,” Millis says. “The vibe is like silly cute goobers, just like how we started.”
The two groups represent a mighty push forward in the expanding Boston skate community.
“[The Boston skate scene] is definitely emerging a little bit more,” Lee agrees. “We keep showing up at skate parks and making it very clear to the people who feel like they dominate that space that we’re not going away and that we’re very intentionally carving out this space for ourselves.”

Josh C. Levin, a recent graduate of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education and a professional rock climber, walks into the Boston Bouldering Project with an orange-striped skateboard and a Harvard Basketball shirt.
Dropping off his bag and skateboard by the bouldering wall, Levin looks around for a quiet spot to talk before we climb.
Levin is popular among the climbers, and a friend catches him almost immediately to say hi. Another introduces Levin to a few novice friends as the best climber in the gym.
For Levin, climbing has always been in his blood.
“My parents would tell you all sorts of horror stories about trying to find Josh as a young child and not really knowing where I was, but then looking up into a tree like, ‘Ah, that’s where he went,’” he says.
When Levin was four years old, his parents decided to find a constructive outlet for his boundless energy. So, they signed him up for rock climbing classes at a nearby gym.
“From that point on, I just fell in love with movement-based activities,” he says. From martial arts to flying trapeze to, most recently, skateboarding and waterskiing, he’s tried them all.
Despite his natural affinity for climbing, Levin was a shy child who disliked group lessons so much he nearly quit the sport. Nonetheless, his head instructor, Stacey Collver, saw his potential.
“It was the first time someone outside of my immediate family believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself,” Levin says. “That made all the difference in the world.”
The two soon formed a close bond, and under Collver’s coaching, Levin soared to success. After winning his first national speed climbing title at only nine years old, he went on to become a 19-time national climbing champion and represented the U.S. at the Youth Olympics in 2014 and 2018.
But tragedy soon struck: when Levin was 10, Collver developed lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a rare lung disease that required a double lung transplant. Though Collver’s steadily decreasing lung capacity forced her to lug around an oxygen tank, she never stopped climbing.
When Levin joined American Ninja Warrior in 2016, 12 years after Collver successfully received the lung transplant, he was inspired to use the show as a platform to support others going through similar struggles.
“My big vision and drive to compete on American Ninja Warrior that first time around, and since then, has been to raise awareness for organ donation and advocate for people to register as organ donors,” he says.
To Levin, the show means more than just the physical challenge.
“It’s not only about doing these really advanced obstacles on a course, but it’s also a platform to understand how to overcome obstacles outside of that,” he says.
Before his first competition season, Levin, too, faced challenges in his personal life and academic life as an undergraduate at Northeastern studying mechanical engineering. Already struggling through a breakup and a difficult semester in which he earned a D in thermodynamics, Levin underwent surgery for a shoulder injury, putting a stop to all athletic activity for four months — including his plans to compete in American Ninja Warrior.
“It was the first time in my life where I really felt like the things that I identified with — namely, being strong academically, strong physically, strong emotionally — were all being pushed out,” he says. “I couldn’t have that same faith in my abilities that I used to have.”
Hoping to switch focus and escape Boston for a while, Levin accepted an internship at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California as a member of the Mars Perseverance Rover group. In the process, he gained perspective on the struggles of recent months.
“People were taking the same passion I had for climbing and applying it to solving these truly groundbreaking challenges, like putting a new rover on the surface of Mars,” he says. “That completely blew me away.”
Newly inspired to rise to his own full potential, Levin finally made it onto the eighth season of American Ninja Warrior in 2016 and was named Rookie of the Year. He returned again in 2017 and 2018, each time making it to national finals. This year, for season 14, Levin returned to the American Ninja Warrior stage for the first time since 2018, falling just short of the $1 million dollar prize. In the intervening four years, Levin reached for new heights in climbing and fine-tuned his academic interests.
When rock climbing was introduced for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Levin focused his efforts on his Olympic dream. He placed seventh at the U.S. Olympic Trials, falling short of the top four ranking required to qualify.
Around the same time, an opportunity knocked on Levin’s door. Levin’s former high school teacher had been developing a new American Ninja Warrior-themed physics curriculum at the Synapse School, a K-8 school in California. The teacher, who had seen Levin compete on the show, asked if he would like to be a guest instructor for the pilot course.
Levin was thrilled. “I sat there sitting at my phone like, ‘How can I say yes faster?’” he says.
In the following years, Levin worked with the Synapse School to develop a project-based model of learning that would bring the physics of the American Ninja Warrior obstacle course into the classroom.
“This opportunity for me to teach this class — which combines my three passions of education, plus technology, plus Ninja Warrior — was just the perfect intersection,” he says.
Realizing that he had developed an interest in teaching, Levin decided to pursue a master’s degree in education, enrolling in the Learning Design, Innovation, and Technology program at the Graduate School of Education.
Levin returned to the Synapse School this fall to take on a full-time teaching position dedicated to interdisciplinary, hands-on learning.
Still, no matter where Levin’s teaching and American Ninja Warrior dreams take him, he’ll never let go of the rock climbing journey that started it all.
“It’s very much a lifelong pursuit,” he says, scanning the crowded gym. “I know plenty of people in their 70s who still climb to this day, and I hope to be climbing to that age and beyond.”
His enthusiasm for the sport convinced me to try my own hand at climbing.
I ask about the most difficult path on the wall, and he agrees to demonstrate. He scales the wall with ease, leaping from one electric blue handhold to another. As he flies through the air, shouts of awe erupt from the mats below.
I try my luck on easier terrain. When I hit the ground again, chalk dust smeared on my jeans, I can see his knack for teaching. “See?” he says, giving me a high-five. “It’s just problem-solving.”

Taeku Lee is the inaugural Bae Family Professor of Government at Harvard University and one of three faculty members recently brought in as part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s ethnic studies cluster hire initiative. He previously served as a professor of political science and law at University of California, Berkeley. He currently serves on the National Advisory Committee for the U.S. Census Bureau. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Were you politically active as an undergrad at the University of Michigan, and if so, what were you involved in?
TL: In my college years I was supposed to be attending a lot of medical school classes, but I found myself actually very drawn to a lot of political causes that were activating and mobilizing students in my time.
The mid-1980s were a time where the United States and then-Soviet Union looked as though they were poised down this inexorable path toward nuclear warfare. My involvement in that issue then got me interested in a lot of other kinds of geopolitical issues. So I organized around U.S. foreign policy in Central America and the U.S.’s relationship to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa at the time. I did a good bit of work around hunger and famine particularly in what was then Ethiopia, now Ethiopia and Eritrea. Also, in Ann Arbor itself there are a lot of problems with hunger and homelessness.
FM: How did you finally make the plunge and decide to pursue political science research, and did you ever find yourself wavering between political science and other fields or running for office or being in an NGO?
TL: I drew a mentor who was actually a medical school professor at Michigan but who had also been an activist through most of his life, especially in the ’60s and ’70s. I was explaining a struggle I was having at the time where I was organizing close to 100 medical students to engage in an act of civil disobedience at the Nevada nuclear test site. But I was telling him that I actually had not reached that point in my own political views about civil disobedience that I thought I was willing to cross the line to be arrested for this cause.
So my mentor at the time, Dr. Arthur Vander, just looked at me with a wry smile on his face and he said, “You know, Taeku, you have to realize that some people are really good at doing and some people are really good at thinking about doing, and I think you might be the latter kind of person, even though your views on politics are obviously very heartfelt.”
That actually took me down a road of being a lot more interested in political philosophy. Eventually, from that, I made what was a very hard decision, especially for an immigrant and maybe also for an immigrant from an Asian American family — to choose to leave medical school to pursue a PhD which at the time was going to either be in philosophy or in political science.
FM: Much of your research has focused on Asian American political participation and public political participation at large. How did you become interested in this topic as an academic endeavor?
TL: A key turning point for me was 1992, with the LA uprising where I keenly felt the paradox of being in a PhD program at the time in political science, reading the works of different political philosophers, while [people in] Los Angeles — which is a city where a lot of my extended family was living, including an uncle and an aunt who ran a small mom-and-pop shop that was at risk of being burnt down — were just defending their lives and their livelihoods. I keenly felt like there was something fundamentally misguided about my pursuit of thinking about politics and political science without understanding at a very fundamental level the history of racial politics in the United States, and in particular, the history of anti-Black racism in the United States. And so I took a 180-degree turn away from what I was interested in at that time, which was a combination of game theory and Marxist theory, and then just dove into a lot of history and sociology courses about the Black experience in the United States. It wasn’t until I was further along in my career that I was able to really focus on Asian Americans.
FM: You serve as one of the principal investigators of the National Asian American Survey and have been involved with the survey since its first report in 2008. How did the survey and your involvement with it start?
TL: In terms of the ability to have an infrastructure for doctoral students in political science to be able to do dissertations on Asian American politics, you need access to data, and you need access to human capital, which means faculty who have given some thought and done some research on Asian Americans.
So I got together with a few fellow political scientists who had all just recently been tenured. None of us had been tenured based solely on our interest in Asian American politics, and we decided that since we now have a certain amount of job security, we’re going to take a risk, apply for grants that we had no right to expect to be funded, and then try to build that infrastructure. And we were lucky to be able to convince several foundations, and then the National Science Foundation, to help fund the first major political survey of how Asian Americans think and what they actually do in the realm of politics. And that was sufficiently successful that we were then able to do two more National Asian American surveys after that in 2012 and 2016.
In this case, I think there was such a dearth of interest in surveying the opinions of Asian Americans that we discovered some people wanted to stay on the phone and just keep talking to our interviewers. Some of our interviews went on for 50, 60, 70 minutes, and we had to start retraining the interviewers to break off on the interviewer end as opposed to on the respondent end. I think that’s a good example of what a gap there was between the lived experiences of Asian Americans and the trained social scientists who had the resources and the training to be able to go out there and study those lived experiences.
FM: In one of your recently published papers, you describe how belief in fake news, which you define as “the willingness of mass publics to believe that news that is verifiably true or that meets journalistic standards of facticity is instead a fiction,” becomes associated with Trump after he became president. Now that midterms and 2024 election are on the horizon, are you still seeing that belief in fake news is still associated with the sector of the Republican party that are supportive of Trump?
TL: I think what we’re learning at least since 2016, and maybe well before then, is the idea that democracy should be founded on institutions that mediate what is true, what is not true, what is evidence, what is not evidence. It’s one of the most foundational aspects of any working government, whether it’s a democracy or not a democracy. And today, there is this dire looming threat against what I think of as the epistemic institutions of democracy. So it’s not just mainstream media and the trust that the public has in what they are getting as news, but there’s a threat to universities and colleges that is growing. There’s a threat to government agencies whose basic job is to take evidence about what those social problems are and try to find solutions to them — everything from the FDA and the CDC to even the Securities and Exchange Commission.
There’s all sorts of fundamental threats to institutions that basically have to adjudicate truth every day as part of their work. I think the fact that those are being so deeply challenged today is a really understated part of this overall threat to democracy that we’re facing, and I think it has a lot of impact on what we see on the surface, which are things like the January 6 insurrection. Those things are fed by deep beliefs about what is actually happening in American society and what the government is and isn’t doing about that. And if we don't have any way to communicate about what actually is happening or what is not happening, then I think we’re going to see more incidents like that in our future.
FM: How do you suggest people navigate news and media in order to make informed political decisions?
TL: One of the foundations behind the fake news phenomenon and this threat to epistemic institutions is a fundamental erosion of trust in public institutions, whether it’s government or universities or what have you. It’s very hard to regain trust once it’s lost.
We probably need something like a Marshall Plan in terms of a reinvestment in institutions that can rebuild that public trust. Specific to elections, I think a starting point would be something like public funding of elections, so that you take the money out of a lot of the motive of different vested parties who have their own private interests to circulate news that they know is not true or evidence-based. You take that profit motive out, and I think you’re much likelier to have exposure to information that is evidence-based, that is tested, has facticity, and that is a foundation on which you can start to rebuild that trust.
FM: What is your advice to students who are interested in promoting informed civic engagement?
TL: Choose what your gateway drug is. Start somewhere. When you start somewhere and start working with other people, I think there’s much greater rewards to trying to make change and make change with other people in concert, whether it’s hugely successful or just somewhat successful. Just the process of doing politics with other people is rewarding.
FM: I understand that you’re working on a textbook for undergraduates to be published soon with the Cambridge University Press. What do you hope to accomplish, and what gaps in the existing literature do you hope the textbook fills? 
TL: This is written as a textbook both for college classes about racial and ethnic politics in the United States, and for an introductory course to U.S. politics, because in my view, and in the view of my co-authors, those two are not dissociable. So in a way, if you think about the current debate over what has been framed as critical race theory, in some ways we take a firm position on that — which is that it’s difficult, if not impossible to teach a course on American politics without at the same time teaching a course on the role that race plays in American politics, both historically and in the present day.
Now, what differentiates us from at least some versions of critical race theory is we don’t take it as an assumption that that’s the case. A lot of the textbook is a very careful vetting of the best available research and evidence that we have across a whole range of issues and across a whole range of institutions — from the courts, to the criminal justice system, to Congress, to state and local politics. And the evidence fully supports our views that wherever you think an issue is really about partisanship, or ideological differences, or class differences, or any other kinds of differences, there’s always a role that racial differences and racial divisions play in helping to explain what those politics really are.
FM: When can we expect to see it come out?
TL: We’re probably going to have some version of it that is ready by next spring, and it’ll be fully ready by next fall.
FM: Can we look forward to another potential book in the future? If so, could you give our readers a brief description of its topic and the questions it seeks to answer?
TL: The next book that I’m committed to working on is on a project with a colleague of mine at Oxford University looking at public opinion about banks and financial regulation. For us, that’s a fascinating topic because a lot of political scientists talk, almost casually, about this idea of business power: the idea that even in democratic societies, the interests of business elite, the one percent, will always be taken into account by elected representatives who in democracies are supposed to represent the interests of the majority. In fact, in most democracies, it is the case that if you work your way backwards from policies regulating banks, it certainly seems to be the case that they always represent the interests of banking elites. So we’re curious to know, what are the circumstances in which that’s not likely to be the case? Or, in short, what are the circumstances in which voters can be made to get angry, get outraged and turn towards specific kinds of regulations that would curb some of the unfettered greed of a lot of banks in democratic societies.
FM: You’re joining us from UC Berkeley, but you’ve previously served as an assistant professor at the Kennedy School. How does it feel to be back?
TL: Spatially, I think the university is quite different. Culturally, I think the university is different in the degree to which assistant professors are more fully part of the intellectual community and given every chance to have a career here at Harvard. I think culturally, also, the student body is much more active and activist than they used to be. Students have always been and will always be very active, but I think there’s a degree to which the events of the last few years are going to fundamentally change how young adults see themselves in their roles in a society that is facing lots of very urgent, serious issues. I would be appalled if students weren't more active, and they certainly seem to be quite active.
FM: What gap in our current faculty do you hope to fill, whether that be in the Government department or in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences as a whole?
TL: One of the things that’s really changing in the real world today is the degree to which identity-based politics is posing deep threats to what have for a very long period of time been very stable democracies. The politics of identity is playing a role that is inextricable from the rise of lots of populist movements, nativist movements in a lot of different societies, and that is an area that I think political scientists need to focus more on. So I don’t want to just say, “Harvard and other universities need to hire more people that are doing what I do,” since that is part of what I do, but I do think that this is an area where there are some profound changes going on in our society, and the more brainpower universities like Harvard could put to it, the better.
FM: This fall and spring, you’re teaching a research workshop class for graduate students. What other classes do you hope to teach in the future?
TL: Next year, I’m very eager to start teaching undergraduate courses. I think I’ll probably offer a course on Asian American politics, and I may also offer a broader course on racial and ethnic politics using this textbook that we’re just completing.
FM: You joined Harvard as one of three scholars hired as part of the FAS’s ethnic studies cluster hire initiative. What is your hope for the future of ethnic studies at Harvard?
TL: I think we are not quite at square one, because we now have three of us who’ve agreed to be part and to hopefully take the lead in this effort to build something. But we’re still very much in the early stages, and this is an exciting stage where anything could be possible. We don’t quite know where all the barriers are, but I do know that this has been the most recent culmination of a 50-year effort to hire faculty in this area and to try to build some programs. So I’m not going to assume that we will be able to figure out the secret sauce to building a successful program overnight, but I’m also excited to see what we’re able to build.
FM: Some scholars and activists are adamantly supportive of establishing ethnic studies departments in universities across the United States. Others push back against the concept of an “ethnic studies” department, arguing it lumps together unique areas and cultural studies that should be departments or programs in their own right. What is your take on this discussion? Would you hope that the FAS establish an ethnic studies department sometime in the future?
TL: Fundamental to a university is the organization of inquiry into not only different topical areas, but also different disciplinary perspectives. So one issue that has always been a challenge throughout the history of building ethnic studies programs has been a deep skepticism, often on the part of other disciplines or on the part of senior administration at a university, that there is a unifying discipline around ethnic studies. And I think that has to be one of the foundational challenges that Professor Lee, Hoffnung-Garskof, and I and whoever else that we’re able to hire or persuade to join our group — a lot of very open discussions about what we think this unifying perspective on inquiry into ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration would be at Harvard.
They’re different if you look across different universities. Some universities center the study of race and the way that they think about an intellectual hub like this one. Others center the experience of diaspora, some center the tension between diaspora and indigeneity. There are a lot of different kinds of ways to foreground what that unique perspective might be, but I think we need to have one. If you don’t have one, it’s always going to be difficult – firstly, to persuade Central Campus, if you will, that there is a basis, a foundation for a separate department. And if you don’t have that, even if you are able to persuade somebody, it will be hard to sustain that effort.

In just the third week of the Phillips Brooks House Association’s Summer Urban Program, Rachel E. Zhou ’24, a counselor at the Chinatown Adventure camp, reached their breaking point.
Zhou had spent the morning organizing a field trip to the Fogg Art Museum, rounding up campers, and occasionally chastising them when they didn’t follow directions. After an unbearably hot commute back to their school in Chinatown, Zhou sat down and started to feel dizzy. As the boys went downstairs to the bathroom, the girls waited with Zhou, who started to feel nauseated and began hyperventilating before breaking into tears.
Zhou tried to pull it together, not wanting the campers to see them in such a vulnerable state, and even asked someone else to step in as they tried to cool down. But without air-conditioning, Zhou felt like they couldn’t breathe. They ended up leaving camp early that day.
“I’m supposed to be responsible for their well-being. And I can’t because I was so overwhelmed,” Zhou says. “I was so exhausted that I just completely lost it.”
“I could handle getting bullied by middle schoolers all day, but as soon as I started to physically feel ill, I felt like the entire camp was destroying my body piece by piece.”
Though Zhou’s panic attack was in part due to the effects of heat exhaustion during a record-hot Boston summer, they also attribute it to what they see as unrealistic expectations for counselors at SUP.
SUP began in the 1960s as an effort to address educational inequality in low-income communities and has expanded over the decades to serve many Cambridge and Boston neighborhoods. This summer, it served more than 800 campers between the ages of 6 and 13 across its 12 camps, hosted in community centers and Boston Public School buildings. The camps offered six weeks of academic enrichment and extracurricular programming for just $140 per camper.
Though PBHA’s full-time staff supervise SUP, its day-to-day is run by 130 students from Harvard and other colleges. Some work as “directors,” an administrative role that involves overseeing camp operations, training and supervising counselors, and managing finances. Others work as “senior counselors,” leading a class of approximately 10 students in a part-camp counselor, part-teacher role. Ninety local high schoolers serve under them as “junior counselors.”
In interviews with 20 SUP affiliates, some counselors and directors said that their work, though challenging, left them feeling that they made a real impact on campers and forged genuine connections with the local community. “The community of students that I was working with was truly amazing,” says Mallory E. Rogers ’25, a director at SUP this summer. “It was truly an invaluable experience. I appreciate it in so many ways.”
But others, like Zhou, said the expectations of running the program are unreasonable for college students without teaching experience, and that the stressors of the job, exacerbated by inadequate training and poor communication from PBHA, left them exhausted and disillusioned. “We’re not adults — we’re not teachers,” says Zhou. “[I] couldn’t take a moment to make sure I was taking care of my physical health.”
Some counselors, as well as PBHA leadership, attribute any dysfunction to the scramble to commence in-person programming after two virtual summers.
Maria Dominguez Gray, PBHA’s executive director, wrote in an email that she “and the whole leadership team recognize that this was a challenging summer,” and PBHA is “open to looking at what could be done better.” However, she maintains that SUP was “overall successful” this summer, commending “the extraordinary dedication and thoughtfulness of the staff and students that stewarded the camps this year.”
In recruitment materials, PBHA describes a summer spent staffing SUP as “the hardest summer you’ll ever love.” But some counselors felt unprepared for just how hard it would be, and left the program disillusioned with public service at PBHA, wondering if doing social good must necessarily come at the cost of their own well-being.
Sumaiyea A. Uddin, a student at Wellesley College, has always wanted to be a teacher. At the start of the summer, she was eager to foster that passion by teaching refugee campers as a counselor for SUP’s Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment program.
“In the beginning, I loved PBHA. I loved the mission,” she says.
Seema Kumari ’25, another counselor at BRYE, was also looking forward to spending her summer working with kids and supervising field trips.
“When I started I was very happy,” Kumari recalls.
But neither of them anticipated the demanding work and long hours that awaited them.“[The] reality was horrible,” Uddin says. Midway through the summer, “I was contemplating quitting. And I know a few of my co-workers were as well.”
“I knew that I would have to wake up early and stuff like that, but I didn’t know that there would be days when I would have to work for 11 hours,” Kumari says.
Kumari’s days began just after the sun rose. Each morning at 6:30 a.m., she walked from her DeWolfe dorm to The Inn and boarded a Harvard-run shuttle headed for the Richard J. Murphy School in Dorchester, using the 25-minute ride to finalize the day’s curriculum. Once in Dorchester, she spent the next two hours escorting 90 BRYE campers onto the shuttle along 20 stops, coordinating pick-up times with parents over text. Around 8:30 a.m., Kumari and the campers arrived at the school, and the official workday began.
Kumari and her junior counselor spent the morning teaching and the afternoon playing games and organized activities. Once camp ended at 3:30 p.m., counselors and campers would board the shuttles, with Kumari again coordinating with parents so all campers made it safely back home.
Kumari didn’t arrive back on campus until around 6 p.m. From there, the rest of her night would be spent meeting with program directors, preparing the next day’s lesson, and cooking meals from groceries bought using her $5,000 summer stipend.
Though timing varied depending on the week, Kumari says she usually worked about 11 hours per day. Her longest workday lasted 13 hours when a shuttle broke down.
According to Kumari’s estimates, including time spent preparing over the weekend, BRYE counselors worked around 60 hours per week, amounting to 360 hours spent during the 6 weeks of camp. All SUP counselors also logged about 70 hours over two weeks of training before camps started. Senior counselors earned a $5,000 stipend for the summer, with $200 deducted from their paycheck for on-campus housing — though as an international student, Kumari says she had $700 deducted from hers. Using Kumari’s approximations, the pay for BRYE senior counselors averaged out to less than the state minimum wage, though the regulation does not apply to this type of stipend.
Though counselors at other SUP camps worked fewer hours a day because they were not responsible for camper pick-up or drop-off, many still felt their work was under-compensated given its challenging nature.
“It’s hard because this is service work, but it’s also extremely emotionally taxing to do this work,” Zhou says, noting that their doctor prescribed them anti-anxiety medication over the summer to cope with job-related stress.
Some counselors also found it hard to make ends meet. “I know that people have had problems with affording groceries,” says Khanh Le ’25, a student director of BRYE. Students were mostly left on their own for meals, apart from two Harvard University Dining Services meal swipes per week.
Dominguez Gray emphasizes that the money given to student staff is not an hourly wage, but a stipend meant to meet basic living expenses for the summer.
“We also take the extra step, because a stipend is also not an excuse for not paying people the minimum wage or a living wage,” she says, adding that PBHA adjusts the stipend according to how many hours students work until it “feels ethically okay.” According to Gray, students are saving on their housing by paying below an estimated worth of $2,000 for summer housing, and during training, breakfast and lunch are provided. “It's certainly above living wage,” she says. She adds that PBHA only expects counselors to work around 40 hours per week, and that time spent commuting and working on curricula is not factored into the stipend.
Despite the 40-hour expectation, some counselors felt compelled to stay overtime to ensure campers weren’t left unattended.
Tenzin T. Lhadon, a junior counselor for SUP’s Cambridge Youth Enrichment Program, says that though she was allowed to leave school at 3 p.m. each day, she usually stayed late. “I didn’t want to leave any of my kids unattended just because some of their parents didn't get to pick them up until 4, and I just felt like it was my responsibility to stay with them.”
Some counselors and directors also said that the training they received did not equip them to handle interpersonal challenges they faced on the job.
Mary M. McConville ’24 recalls that during her time as a director of CYEP this summer, she had to deal with much more interpersonal conflict and behavioral issues than she felt prepared for. One of the six-year-old campers would often run out of the classroom unannounced, “just sprinting down the hallways,” she recalls. As a director, McConville was responsible for talking with the child, but the issue persisted, leaving her feeling like she didn’t have the tools to handle it.
The two-week long training for senior counselors is developed “with a set of competencies that are reviewed every year,” Dominguez Gray says.
She adds that the training for director positions is more extensive and starts during the spring semester. According to her, the training — which includes weekly meetings during the school year, individual sessions with PBHA staff, and a week-long intensive at the start of the summer — goes above the American Camping Association’s standards for counselor training. During the summer, she adds, former SUP counselors return to help coach student directors.
“They’re really learning and being trained on and coaching and developing skills. It’s pretty much the equivalent of getting to run a small nonprofit,” Dominguez Gray says.
Despite the training, some counselors felt that a lack of professional personnel and resources meant some issues were outside of their control. In BRYE, this led to health risks for campers.
On the third day of BRYE, a senior counselor who requested to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions from PBHA, heard a camper complaining of stomach pain. Because no certified school nurses work within SUP, the counselor escorted the camper to the director’s office, where the child called her parents. She later returned to class after it was determined they were not coming to pick her up.
At drop-off, they heard a noise at the back of the van. The camper had vomited into her hands.
The camper was Muslim, and since there were no halal food options at breakfast or lunch, she hadn’t eaten anything since the day began. Her stomach empty, her vomit “was basically just bile,” the counselor says.
At the end of the week, the incident was brought up at a staff meeting, according to multiple attendees. But PBHA administrators didn’t take the complaints as seriously as some counselors hoped, instead suggesting that parents could provide lunch themselves in case PBHA couldn’t find money in the budget for halal food.
Counselors were concerned that their worries for their campers’ well-being were being dismissed. “If they’re low-income, they might be struggling with food,” Uddin says, arguing it was unreasonable to expect parents to provide lunch when the program advertises otherwise.
The meeting quickly devolved into an argument between counselors, directors, and administration, according to Uddin. Some left the PBHA building in tears. “It was pretty traumatic,” the counselor says.
SUP meals are provided for free by the Boston Public School system. Though BPS does not typically offer halal food over the summer, according to Dominguez Gray, it does provide vegetarian lunches which often happen to be halal — but none were provided until PBHA reached out when complaints were raised at the staff meeting. The issue wasn’t formally corrected by BPS until about two weeks later, according to Kerry J. McGowan, who works full-time for PBHA as the director of programs.
BPS wrote in a statement that it is “committed to ensuring all students are welcomed and affirmed, and all aspects of our instruction and operations are culturally sustaining.”
The district encourages students and families seeking Halal meals or other religious accommodations to contact the district’s Office of Equity, which then takes all possible steps to meet those requests,” the statement said.
BRYE doesn’t typically serve Muslim campers, but this year it partnered with the Refugee Immigrant Assistance Center, a Massachusetts-based refugee resettlement organization. A week before camp started, 15 Afghan students joined the program, but PBHA leadership failed to anticipate the need for halal food before camp started.
Some counselors saw PBHA’s attempts to retroactively fix the issue as half-hearted. At first, PBHA staff delivered Lunchables from the local Stop & Shop, according to the BRYE counselor. After a few days, snack packets of cheese, almonds, and dried cranberries were shipped in. Each Muslim camper was given two for lunch.
Dominguez Gray says she reached out to staff from BPS and city officials about the issue, adding that PBHA wants to “be partners in helping address [it] for all of our children.”
D’Ara S. Campbell, a junior at Howard University who worked as a counselor at SUP’s Franklin Intergenerational Outreach Summer Program, wrote in a text message that the work of managing a classroom of kids was made even more difficult with “centipedes, spiders, ants, and flies” crawling “all throughout” the James P. Timilty Middle School. Campbell and other counselors felt that some of the camp facilities — most camps are run in schools within the BPS system — couldn’t support the campers.
Many schools, including Campbell’s, lacked air-conditioning, and on days over 95 degrees, the Boston Public School system would close all schools, sometimes without warning, Campbell says.
Counselors would need to think on their feet, taking the kids to a library or organizing outdoor water-based activities, for which they needed to coordinate with parents. “It was a summer where we really had to lean on each other,” Campbell says. “There were moments where it seemed like we couldn’t stay there another day.”
“It was very surprising seeing the condition our camp was in,” she adds. “It was kind of like, ‘There’s got to be another option.’ And the fact there wasn’t made it very disheartening, knowing that SUP has so many connections — you know, it’s Harvard-affiliated — but it still felt like we were not getting the best of what we should have.”
According to Dominguez Gray, the facilities’ conditions are reflective of the economic reality faced by the communities they serve year-round. “It is not feasible to run SUP out of Harvard buildings for several reasons and I believe the idea is problematic from a values perspective,” she wrote in an email, adding that working in local buildings helps integrate SUP staff into the community and is more convenient for the campers.
“While there are some challenges in some of the facilities that may be surprising to some Harvard students who have different lived experiences, trying to figure out how we can help advocate with partners to make the situation better for all children and families is more in line with our approach and what we are planning to do to address these challenges for next year,” she wrote.
BPS is executing a district-wide push to install air conditioning in its non-HVAC buildings, which it expects to be completed in Spring 2023, according to a statement from the school system. The district also has a pest control program and intervention team to respond to reports of pests, the BPS statement said, adding that “the concern at the Timilty School was reported and promptly addressed.”
In May, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 rolled out a $2 billion city investment in BPS facilities, which she dubbed a “Green New Deal” for the district.
“We are not yet where we want and need to be, but we will continue to strive to make progress daily,” the statement said. “Mayor Michelle Wu’s investment in a Green New Deal for Boston Public Schools will make this a reality, addressing our infrastructure challenges and building a future for the district that meets the needs of all our students.”
Despite the conditions of the school, Campbell says “the attitudes of the kids helped keep me going every single day.”
Still, her fondness for her campers didn’t detract from her grievances with the program. Not only did she feel frustrated with the lack of resources and direction, but she felt that these issues were being ignored by program leadership. “Sometimes it does feel like we’re the little worker ants, and there’s a lot going on, and sometimes it feels like we can’t fix it or that we’re not being heard about it,” she says.
“I had to control how I felt about it, and quell how I felt about it, and make sure that I’m still giving these kids what they deserve,” she adds, “giving them a great summer, even with what we had.”
Some counselors, as well as PBHA leadership, attribute many of the issues this summer to the difficulties of revitalizing SUP after two virtual years.
This summer was the first time since 2019 that SUP functioned fully in-person, and few returning counselors had ever worked at non-virtual SUP. The summer felt a bit like “reinventing the wheel,” McGowan says.
Before the pandemic, Dominguez Gray says incoming counselors were more aware of the challenges their job would entail.
“It's the hardest summer you’ll ever love, right? That’s something that alumni have said for a really long time,” Gray says. “Most incoming counselors know how hard the experience will be because they know it from their peers. Peers recruit peers.”
But because of the pandemic, almost none of the counselors had a full picture of what working at SUP would be like.
In anticipation of that institutional memory loss, PBHA hired a team of SUP alumni support staff to help run the camps.
However, even with these measures in place, some counselors still felt unprepared for another pandemic-induced challenge: a higher prevalence of behavioral issues in campers.
Those who had experience with SUP before it went remote say that this summer, they noticed more behavioral issues with the campers, most of whom had spent several of their formative years in an unstructured classroom setting via Zoom.
When McConville recounts her experience handling the six-year-old who would run out of the classroom, she attributes part of the issue to the child having spent two years learning online. “They were probably illustrating behavior more like a 4- or 5-year-old,” McConville says.
“We were learning on the fly,” McGowan says. “As much as we know about running these programs, we’ve never done it before with kids, as well as adults, who have experienced the impact of a global pandemic for two years.”
“I don’t think it’s something anyone could have prepared for,” says Alan R. Dai ’22, a student director who returned to SUP’s Chinatown Adventure camp for his third summer. “[Covid] affects not only the campers, but it also affects those teachers or counselors,” he says. “Our own ability to respond to new challenges is impeded in some ways because we’re also learning the ropes.”
Though Dominguez Gray acknowledges the challenges of returning to in-person summer programming during an ongoing pandemic, she says “it also doesn’t mean that we turn our backs on our communities and the children and the families that rely on us, that have always relied on us for generations.”
Before camp started, SUP counselors received two weeks of training, covering topics like diversity and conflict resolution through restorative justice, communication with families, and curriculum planning.
Rogers, a SUP director, says the training gave her tools to handle most situations. “There were definitely conversations that would come up and I was like, ‘I don’t know how to handle this,’” she says. “But overall, I think [I] had pretty good training.”
Dominguez Gray says that the training attempts to strike a balance between being comprehensive and concise. She adds that training involves substantial time with teachers who help counselors understand how to work with each age group.
However, some counselors felt that the training was misaligned with the scope of the problems before them, making managing the campers more difficult on the job.
A lot of the training felt unproductive, says Zhou, adding that some of the time dedicated to sensitivity training would have been better spent teaching counselors how to handle a classroom. “The type of people who are drawn to this work are the type of people who are already going to be in social justice circles, who already care about community building, who obviously don’t know everything but already probably are somewhat familiar with race and racism.”
Trainings were not tailored to camp-specific issues, they say, noting that even when the trainings did discuss race, they failed to address AAPI-sensitive issues even though the Chinatown Adventure camp served almost exclusively Asian American campers.
“The training was very much just lofty and very much felt like the organization was trying to just cover their own liability or try and spout these very lofty principles,” says Zhou.
“We didn’t really learn about classroom management,” says Uddin. “It was a stupid restorative justice workshop that we learned nothing from at all.”
BRYE requires counselors to teach English as a Second Language, though the camp-specific training related to ESL was only four hours long. Counselors found themselves having to navigate conflict resolution with campers who didn’t speak the same language. Le, a BRYE director, recalls one instance when two campers who spoke different languages got in a physical fight over a simple miscommunication.
Hieu “Annie” Vu, a junior counselor at BRYE, says that much of the burden of translation fell upon her and a few other junior counselors from the area who spoke Vietnamese.
“I would say, honestly, you could never get enough training,” McGowan says, though he adds that some counselors already feel burnt out at the end of the training as is.
Vu attended BRYE as a camper for about five years, and says that she and her peers “went home with amazing memories.”
This summer, Vu became a junior counselor to give back to the program. “I want to give my campers good memories as well,” she says. “That’s what BRYE has given me.”
Though she admits there were challenges with communication and workload, on the whole, she’s satisfied with the work that BRYE has done to help campers gain confidence in their English. “I feel like BRYE still holds up the expectation of helping them connect to the place they call home,” she says.
For Rogers, seeing the impact of her work made her experience “one of the best summers that I’ve had.”
“I think sometimes you see Harvard students that come and do [SUP] for a year and don’t appreciate it, but you can see the community that it builds,” she adds.
Indeed, SUP’s success is often measured through its impact on its campers, many of whom would not have a chance to participate in a summer camp otherwise. According to a PBHA-conducted survey of 431 parents (72 percent of enrolled families), 98 percent said their child enjoyed their camp experience this summer.
However, the significance of the camp for the communities it serves underscores the importance of addressing student staff concerns before next summer, Campbell says.
“There’s a lot of kids who are coming from these areas, and who don’t have a choice,” she says. “Because they don't have a choice, we should make SUP better for them, and I really hope that can be done.”
Several student counselors and directors said they would likely not return to SUP in the future, discouraged from what they saw as the systematic undervaluing of student staff in the name of public service.
Some students even started to question whether SUP’s structure is sustainable.
“We’re not trying to make martyrs out of people,” says Dominguez Gray, highlighting the hiring of the SUP alumni support staff. “We’re not trying to run people into the ground. We’re not trying to burn people out. And so we really do pay attention to collective care and supporting one another.”
Asked if she believed students were prepared to run a program as intense as SUP, Dominguez Gray points to an exchange she had with a counselor who told her, “You told us it would be real service and it’d be hard, but we didn’t know what that meant, and we wouldn’t know what that meant until we experienced it.”
Le confirms this sentiment. “A lot of times we felt unprepared, but that’s also because of the nature of the job.”
“I think that’s the reality of PBHA service across the board,” Dominguez Gray says. “I mean, not that we’re trying to go hard and make things super difficult.” But, she argues that the difficulty of the work is part of the appeal; she says students and alumni have told her that working with PBHA has been “one of the most transformational experiences” they’ve had because “you’re involved in real-life things. This isn’t a cultivated spoon-fed experience.”
Zhou suggests that some of the challenges of the program stem from conflicting components of SUP’s mission.
“Is this a program for underprivileged youth, or is this program for college students?” Zhou asks. Right now, Zhou says, “it’s in this weird in-between space where the kids are screwed because college students don’t know what they’re doing, and the college students are screwed because the kids are kids.”
Clarifying the mission, according to Zhou, could help to reform the program for future years.
PBHA gives a survey to student staff at the end of each summer, and Dominguez Gray says that the results will help PBHA build on the program’s strengths and correct weaknesses in future years.
McGowan, the PBHA director of programs, says that SUP is still in the beginning stages of recovering from the pandemic, a process he likens to crossing a rocky stream. “We’re on step one here, we still have four or five more to go across to get to where we will be, and where we will be is not necessarily where we were in 2019 or before,” he says.
Though the SUP counselors and directors across the 12 camps had different experiences, all recognize the importance of preserving the mission of the program.
“I hit my breaking point really early on —like I was the first of the seven counselors to cry,” says Zhou. “But the one thing that kept me going was I didn’t want to give up [on] the kids.”
“In the moment it sucks, like it sucks a lot,” says Le. “I dropped two clothing sizes.” But after the program, he says, it’s all worth it.
The reason that Dai kept returning to SUP every year is that it was “something directly impactful and unambiguously meaningful for me to be doing with my time at Harvard,” he says. He also wanted to lend his three summers’ worth of past experience to help the student staff revitalize the program.
Though some of the student counselors and directors were discouraged after the turbulent summer, others say that they want to come back and help improve it, for both the staff and the campers.
After directing camp over Zoom, Dai felt especially fulfilled to return to the joys of in-person camp: seeing a crowded cafeteria and watching campers whip out a deck of cards, or grow a passion for chess.
He spoke fondly of Chinatown Adventure’s annual “CHAD Olympics.” “I just remember the joy the kids had with this one event, what’s called ‘Soak the Directors,’” he says, recalling the mischievous glee that five-year-olds and 13-year-olds alike took from chucking wet sponges at the staff.
Though he adds, “I still have bruises from it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, the temperature in the Greater Boston area reached highs of 100 degrees Fahrenheit plus humidity. Faced with record-breaking heat and no air conditioning, some students on Harvard’s campus for the summer reported adverse living conditions and minimal support from program administrators.
The University hosted 22 students on campus this past summer for its Summer Research Opportunities at Harvard — a ten-week program that connects undergraduates from other universities with research internships. The program participants lived in Winthrop House’s Standish Hall, a dorm that offers ceiling fans but not air conditioning.
Some SROH participants said their experience at Harvard was tainted by record-breaking heat and little communication from administrators. Some students left their doors open, stayed awake late into the night, or slept in labs, hallways, and house common spaces, according to four program affiliates.
SROH intern Lena R. Heinrich said living on Harvard’s campus left her in a “steady state of exhaustion.”
“I was up at 3 a.m. most nights during the heatwave. People were sleeping in the library, in the common areas, leaving their doors open and propping them with things so that we could get any kind of airflow,” Heinrich said. “It was really not pleasant. I really wanted to leave.”
SROH participant Abby N. Ross said an intruder broke into her dorm multiple times after she and her suitemates left the door propped open to improve air circulation. The trespasser, a 26-year-old man, was arrested on July 26 and charged with breaking and entering, per a Harvard University Police Department log.
When Denise Yoon, a peer mentor for SROH, asked program administrators to install portable AC units in the dorms to mitigate the heat, it took nearly a week — and intervention from a faculty mentor — for students to receive box fans as a substitute, according to emails obtained by The Crimson.
SROH participants were notified ahead of the program that they would be living in dorms without air conditioning, according to a Harvard spokesperson.
The lapse in communication between participants and administrators culminated in a transportation mishap in late July.
While preparing to travel to a conference in Hartford, Conn. with the other program interns, Heinrich noticed coolant leaking from the bus. Students were told to board the bus anyway, according to Heinrich.
The bus eventually stopped at a rest area due to engine problems, at which point a new bus — without air conditioning or windows that could open — arrived to transport the students. Heinrich said when a student on the second bus passed out due to heat stroke, the situation “devolved into pandemonium.”
“We were in this million-degree bus parked on the side of the freeway in the blaring sun, trying to deal with the person having heat stroke while the rest of us were actively unsafe and extremely overheated,” Heinrich said.
After the student was taken to the hospital, the other passengers were told to get back on the bus. Yoon said she later learned that this was because the bus could not stop on the highway and program directors had called for another bus for students to board at the next rest stop. At the time, the students believed they were traveling the rest of the distance to Hartford on the bus lacking AC.
“In some ways, that’s very understandable — you just can’t stop on the side of the highway,” Yoon said. “I think the major problem was that they got on the bus in the first place.”
In response to student criticisms, College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard welcomes participant feedback.
“We were delighted to welcome students from numerous academic institutions to Harvard's campus this summer for a variety of programs,” Goldman wrote. “Hearing their feedback plays a critical role in helping us to ensure that future cohorts have a meaningful and enjoyable experience.”
Besides the heat and transportation issues, some SROH affiliates reported a lack of clear communication from administrators throughout the summer.
“It’s almost weird to call it issues of communication because there just was none,” SROH mentor Dave Matthews said. “They never told us anything about when they were showing up or telling us about the research symposium that they had going on and making sure we knew deadlines.”
To improve the experience for future iterations of SROH, Yoon said she has engaged in conversations with administrators this fall.
Still, Matthews said he believes the program’s living conditions will make it more difficult for Harvard programs to recruit a diverse group of students in the future.
“You have all these students that have come here and had a horrible experience and been treated poorly by Harvard,” Matthews said. “It reflects poorly, and they now have a bad impression of what it’s like to be here.”
While Ross and Heinrich said they enjoyed their research in the lab, they said their impression of Harvard has been negatively impacted by their residential experience.
“The whole experience, in terms of people caring about your safety and just caring at all, I would say definitely put a bad taste in my mouth and was not what I expected from Harvard,” Heinrich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than two weeks after former Harvard instructor David D. Kane began teaching at Simmons University, the school announced Kane’s class would be canceled and his contract would not be renewed.
Kane left Harvard in June 2021 following accusations that he had posted a series of racist blog posts under a pseudonym. After he began teaching at Simmons University this fall, the school said it was not aware of the blog posts during its hiring process and that it would create a new section of the course and allow students to transfer out of Kane’s class without penalty.
But Simmons announced Friday afternoon that enrollment numbers for Kane’s class — Statistics 118: “Introductory Statistics” — had dipped below the minimum threshold, prompting the school to cancel the course section for the rest of the semester.
“In addition, Simmons will not be renewing his contract,” the university’s Interim Provost Russell Pinizzotto wrote in an email.
In September 2020, students in Harvard’s Government 50: “Data” course, which was taught by Kane at the time, accused the instructor of authoring racist posts on EphBlog, a website founded by Kane for affiliates of Williams College, his alma mater.
The blog featured several posts by an author named “David Dudley Field ’25,” one of which was signed “David Kane ’88.” In the posts, Field criticized “Black supremacy” in the NBA and alleged that more than 90 percent of Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted if not for their race.
Simmons announced that Kane’s section of the statistics course would be discontinued during a sit-in of Kane’s section, according to the college's newspaper, The Simmons Voice. Students flooded the classroom and questioned the instructor about the blog posts.
“Simmons respects the right of student free expression, and we believe that sit-ins, protests, and peaceful demonstrations are important forms of that expression,” Simmons President Lynn Perry Wooten wrote in a statement. “In the coming days, Simmons will host a meeting with students, and we are also reviewing HR best practices.”
Once university administrators sent notice of the course’s cancellation, students applauded as Kane exited the classroom, according to The Voice.

Despite national discussions about a teacher shortage across the country, several affiliates of the Harvard Graduate School of Education have said the shortages are both subject-dependent and more concentrated in specific school districts.
Affiliates said the local nature of shortages, as well as the lack of teachers in the STEM and special education fields, has driven the recent news coverage.
Teacher shortages all across the country have been much more common in rural and low-income areas, while suburban schools offering higher salaries are able to bring in more candidates, according to a recent New York Times article, which also mentions a particularly pronounced need for teachers in math and special education.
Martin West, academic dean at HGSE, said the situation highlights a broader issue in the education system.
“I'm not yet convinced that the situation we're facing now is a national teacher shortage as opposed to the continuation of a situation we've had for quite some time in American education,” he said.
West added that America faces “local shortages” primarily in schools “serving traditionally disadvantaged students.”
HGSE professor Heather C. Hill said she believes teacher shortages have “been a trend that's been ongoing for a long time,” pointing to a decrease in the number of people enrolled in teacher education programs since 2012.
Variations by state, district, and school further complicate staffing issues, according to HGSE professor Susan Moore Johnson, who emphasized that education is “left to the states” at a constitutional level.
“It seems very doubtful to me that the whole nation will focus on this and come up with a particular solution,” Johnson said. “The states regulate teacher licensing requirements, preparation requirements, evaluation requirements, and in some cases pay, and so I think we'll see really substantial state-to-state differences.”
Several affiliates also noted that some teachers have found scrutiny of the education system in the current political climate to be a deterrent from teaching.
Moore Johnson said she believes the “recent focus on banned books” and “constraints on what teachers can say or do in their instruction” have discouraged teachers from staying in the profession.
Hill also cited the move to “take away teacher authority” as a source of the shortage.
“Why go into a profession where you are just going to be doing what you're told as opposed to working creatively, developing expertise, making good judgments, being able to meet the needs of your learners?” Hill said.
When discussing solutions to address the shortage, multiple experts stressed the importance of looking beyond pay raises alone.
HGSE senior lecturer Elizabeth A. City mentioned the need for administrative support alongside wages to “make schools great places for people to work.”
“That means training the leaders, that means supporting the teachers when they're there, and of course, it does mean paying them a salary that's respectful and livable in the geographic context they're in,” she said.
HGSE student Eve Rybnick added that salary variations can also be a deterrent to teachers from moving to areas that do not pay teachers as well as some states in the Northeast.
“The amount of hours that a teacher puts in does not equate to the pay that they're receiving in most parts of the country,” she said. “I was very fortunate to work in New York and New Jersey, which are well-paying states for teachers, but it makes me less likely to work elsewhere.”
Rybnick said she believes increasing autonomy for teachers might help mitigate the logistical challenges of teaching, such as pay and support.
“We need to have more trust in teachers and give them more autonomy, because when you take that away, coupled with low pay and often poor resources, it's just a perfect storm for getting teachers to quit or leave the field which is really unfortunate, because we need teachers more than ever now," she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer reflected on his 42-year career as a federal judge at a Harvard Law School forum on Monday afternoon.
Intisar A. Rabb, director of the Program in Islamic Law at HLS, moderated the event, which also featured Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
Breyer, who graduated from the Law School in 1964, served on the United States Supreme Court for more than 27 years before retiring in June. He returned to HLS this fall to teach a course on constitutional law and regulatory policy.
Monday’s discussion encompassed a range of legal and humanitarian issues, including prison reform and the recent flooding in Pakistan. The justices also talked about the obstacles they faced in their respective courts, such as striving to reach consensus with justices who hold different views.
“Compromise if you can,” Breyer said. “Better to get 30 or 40 percent of what you want than 100 percent of nothing.”
Breyer added that learning played a key role during his time on the bench, citing Google v. Oracle, a case that contested whether copyright protections extend to software interfaces.
“It was a case involving computer language — Java,” he said. “It took me a year and a half, with two law clerks working on this thing, to figure it out.”
Both justices stressed the personal fulfillment their work brings, praising their judicial roles for allowing them to resolve disputes and impact their respective countries.
“If you're a judge, you're sitting there and you know that this case matters to somebody, and therefore you have to give your best, and you have to keep giving.” Breyer said. “As you get older you realize what a privilege that is — what a privilege to have a job where you must behave in that way.”
Shah explained that though he had no initial intention of becoming a judge, a former chief justice told him that becoming a judge on the Court was the best way to “fight for democracies.”
“I would say that at some stage of your life, do consider judgeship,” Shah told attendees. “I think the amount of contribution you can make is absolutely phenomenal, which a lawyer can never even fathom.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard professors and representatives from Black women’s rights organizations unveiled a petition for a posthumous presidential pardon for Callie G. House, who was described as “the foremother” of the slavery reparations movement during a press conference Wednesday.
Standing in front of a portrait of Ida B. Wells in the Harvard Kennedy School’s Fainsod Room, HKS professor Cornell William Brooks called on President Joe Biden to pardon House, saying the move was long overdue.
Brooks was joined by Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., a Harvard Law School professor; Lynn V. Dymally, acting president of the National Congress of Black Women; Erika Swaringen-Blankumsee, a representative of the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs; and a group of Harvard students who helped draft the petition.
Born into slavery in Tennessee in 1861, House later co-founded the Ex-Slave Mutual Relief Bounty and Pension Association, an organization that lobbied the United States Congress to provide reparations for ex-slaves in the 1890s. At its peak, House’s organization boasted hundreds of thousands of members, drawing the attention of several federal agencies that aggressively investigated the group. With scant evidence, House was sentenced in 1917, to a year in jail after she was convicted of mail fraud by an all-white male jury.
“As a consequence of her advocacy, she was targeted, charged, convicted, and incarcerated in her own country,” Brooks said during the press conference. “So here we are, 100 years later, seeking a pardon for a woman — the vindication of a legacy, and exoneration of history.”
Lindsey Batteast, a second-year master’s of public policy student at the Kennedy School who worked to draft the pardon petition, said the students were inspired by how House overcame numerous obstacles in her life to become a leading figure in the reparations movement.
“There’s this saying that you die twice: one time when you stop breathing and the second time is when someone says your name for the last time,” Batteast said. “We cannot allow for the legacy and leadership of Callie House to die.”
“Callie should be a household name without any debate,” Batteast added. “Her legacy should be honored — not stained with an unjust conviction.”
Swaringen-Blankumsee said the reparations movement led by House “should have changed the trajectory of where we are today in this country.”
“Callie House — a true American hero — deserves to have her name spoken in great regard and reverence,” Swaringen-Blankumsee added. “So today, we all stand before you giving Callie House the support that she really deserved, the voice that was stripped from her.”
Sullivan called on Biden to quickly approve House’s pardon, which he has “exclusive and nearly unfettered authority” under the Constitution to do.
“It was an awful, awful conviction designed only to stop a reparations movement,” Sullivan said. “It’s a horrific injustice that has to be remedied.”
The petition was sent to the Department of Justice and to the White House after the end of the press conference, according to Sullivan.
“With the stroke of a pen he can do it,” he said of Biden. “We’re going to call on him to do it.”
In an interview on Tuesday, Brooks said he expects Biden to quickly approve House’s pardon.
“I fully expect my students and our colleagues to go to the White House to celebrate the righting of a historical wrong,” he said. “There’s no question as to the guilt of the federal government in prosecuting an entirely innocent woman.”
“President Biden has a great many difficult decisions related to climate change, related to Ukraine, related to inflation, related to gas prices,” Brooks said. “This is not a hard decision.”

Two days before Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković is set to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York, he gave Harvard affiliates a preview, discussing the global consequences stemming from Russia’s escalation of its invasion of Ukraine at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Wednesday evening.
Plenković said discussions at the UN this week have centered around Russia’s war on Ukraine, which he described as an “unprecedented violation of international law where one permanent member of the Security Council has aggressed and invaded a neighboring country, also [a] member of the United Nations.”
Earlier on Wednesday during a morning address to the nation, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a “partial mobilization” of Russia’s military reservists and issued an implicit threat that Russia was prepared to use nuclear weapons against the West.
“In the event of a threat to the territorial integrity of our country and to defend Russia and our people, we will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin’s transcript of his speech. “This is not a bluff.”
Plenković said Putin’s most recent threats “makes this moment, this UNGA week, very specific.”
“It’s not very often that we discuss the potential of the use of the nuclear weapons in the world,” Plenković said. “We were trying to de-escalate, we were trying to disarm, we were trying to control — this was the objective of the international community within the United Nations system.”
Russia is an authoritarian regime that does not “really agree with the way that the world is globally governed” and takes a “conflictual” approach to world affairs, Plenković said.
Croatia and the rest of the European Union have relied on French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to negotiate with Putin in recent months because they are “the two strongest and the most influential countries” in the bloc, according to Plenković.
But Plenković said the format for negotiating with Russia might change in the future.
“I personally think that the moment will come where the international community might opt for someone who would be very respected from everyone — including in Moscow — as an international personality who can serve as an intermediator or negotiator or the communicator,” Plenković said. “That is an element that hasn’t been explored so far.”
Plenković also responded to a question from an audience member about the restitution of property that belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust from Croatia, saying he will meet with the leader of the World Jewish Congress in New York on Friday.
“We have a dialogue with the representatives of the Jewish community in Croatia and we are in the process of trying to address this issue adequately even though many, many decades has passed,” he said.
“I think there is a lot of goodwill on our side not only to engage into meaningful talks, but to deliver on symbolic gestures that would at least provide some sort of a compensation for the wrongdoings of those who did it almost 80 years ago,” Plenković added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard on Thursday unveiled an 18-member student advisory group that will counsel the search committee tasked with selecting the University’s 30th president.
The student advisory group, chaired by graduate student Christopher H. Cleveland ’14, represents all of Harvard’s graduate schools and the College. Only the College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the Business School are represented with more than one member.
Cleveland previously served on the student advisory committee in 2017 during the search that selected University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
In the Thursday announcement, Penny Pritzker, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, who leads the presidential search committee, said she looks forward to working with the student advisory panel and learning “about the varied perspectives of their peers.”
“Harvard is home to some of the world’s most remarkable students, and it will be invaluable to benefit from the views of this group of outstanding students from across the university, as our search committee thinks about Harvard and its future leadership,” Pritzker said.
The timing of the formation of the student advisory committee closely mirrors previous searches. Following former University President Lawrence H. Summers’ departure from Massachusetts Hall, the 2006 search committee appointed the first student group following a chorus of complaints about a dearth of student involvement in the presidential search process.
The announcement comes roughly a month after the University announced the faculty and staff groups that will advise the presidential search committee.
Though the search committee has not provided a timeline for its process, some long-time donors and higher education experts expect the committee will deliver a final recommendation to the Board of Overseers by the first or second month of 2023. Bacow and his predecessor, Drew G. Faust, were both named to Harvard’s top post on February 11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team traveled to Durham, N.C. to face off against Winthrop University and Duke University in a double header weekend. Despite two commendable performances, the Crimson was unable to find victory in its journey to the Tar Heel State.
Having picked up its first win of the season against Iona College (6-5, 1-1 MAAC) the previous weekend, Harvard (1-7) was eager to keep the ball rolling against Winthrop (4-7) on Friday. The first set would prove promising, as the northerners took advantage of Eagle errors and kills from sophomore outside hitter Corinne Furey to take a tight opener, 25-23. Furey had nine kills on the night, second only to junior outside hitter Katie Vorhies, who notched 13 and leads the team with 75 for the season.
“It feels great to be back; it’s so exciting to be with everyone,” said Vorhies about returning for another season. “This year is very special because we have almost the same team that we did last year…, so the chemistry is there and we already know how to work together.”
If the first set was Furey’s, the third was Vorhies’, as she recorded five kills including and put the Crimson one set away from its second win of the season.
The Eagles proved to be a formidable opponent, however. In the second and fourth sets, they frequently went on multiple-point runs. Sophomore libero Lindsey Zhang led the defense with 14 digs, but even with sophomore setter Rocky Aguirre’s 10, Winthrop handily took the second set, 25-17, and the fourth, 25-19, to force a fifth set sprint to 15.
An early Eagle six-point run for an 8-2 gap proved too much for Harvard to handle, as Winthrop took the match with a fifth set of 15-9. Thus, the Crimson would be forced to seek its second win of the season against a competitive Duke (9-2) squad.
Rounding out its North Carolina trip and non-conference play, Harvard took an early lead against the host Blue Devils from kills by Vorhies, Furey, and first-year outside hitter Brynne Faltinsky. Faltinsky has made her presence known in her rookie season, contributing the fourth-most points per set played.
“As a freshman, it’s so much to handle — coming to a new school, moving to a different state, trying to fit in with this new team that already has chemistry and culture —, but I think they’re all doing that really well,” Vorhies said.
Faltinsky has adapted well to the change: she was named to the Ivy-League Honor Roll after the Bryant Invitational.
Despite this strong rebound from the previous day’s loss, the Crimson could not capitalize on this lead, as Duke surged to take the first set 25-16 and an early 6-2 lead in the second which would soon turn into 15-7. Blue Devil errors and Faltinsky and Vorhies kills would make the rest of the set competitive, but the Durhamites managed to ultimately close it out, 25-21. The two teams were neck-and-neck throughout the beginning of the third, with only a three-point difference when each team crossed the halfway point. A nine-point run, however, allowed Duke to run away with the set, 25-14, and with it the match.
The trip to North Carolina marked the third consecutive multiple-match weekend. Harvard started its season in Rhode Island at the Bryant Invitational, where it fell in straight sets to Bryant (10-6) and Boston College (11-2) and lost a closely contested match to Montana St. (4-8), 22-25, 25-20, 29-27, 25-23. Against Bryant and Montana St., junior hitter Ashley Wang led the team with 10 and 13 kills, respectively. Along with Vorhies’ contributions, junior outside hitter Nicole Prescott earned the Crimson 10 and nine points, respectively, in the latter two matches of the weekend.
“[In] the Bryant weekend, the first match was jitters, and we saw that weekend with each match we were getting better,” senior captain Bella Almanza said. “We hadn’t gotten that win under our belt quite yet, but we were still really proud of each other because we could see in each game our connections getting better, whether in our hitting or our passing.
Harvard would thus have to look for its first win of the season the following weekend at the Harvard Invitational. The Crimson lost a tight home-opener against Utah Valley (5-6) in four sets; each set ended with no more than a four-point gap. Vorhies and Wang led the offense with 15 and 13 kills respectively, and the duo was assisted by Almanza and Aguirre, who set up 25 and 19 points. Harvard’s slide continued in its second match against Georgia (9-2). Although the hosts won the first set, 30-28, the Bulldogs took the next three by margins of nine, seven, and 11.
Disappointed by the slow start to the season, the Crimson was determined to emerge victorious from the weekend’s third match against Iona. A strong start from Harvard to win the first set, 25-15, was soon met by three nail-biting, two-point-margin sets (24-26, 25-23, 28-30). An Almanza assist, one of 38 for the match, to a Wang kill, one of a team-high 19, ended the fifth set, 15-11, and secured the Crimson its first win of the season.
“In that game we acted confident and played confident no matter how we felt,” Almanza recalled. “I think that went really well for us. We’re a team that thrives off energy and confidence; that’s how we play our best, and that’s how we competed against Iona.”
Despite the less-than-ideal weekend in North Carolina, the team is looking forward to starting Ivy League competition.
“These past three weekends, we’ve really been trying to figure things out and get in our rhythm,” Vorhies said. “At this point we’ve learned a lot about our strengths and weaknesses, and we’re ready to go into Ivies next weekend.”
Harvard will begin conference play this Saturday, when it will host Dartmouth at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson defeated the Big Green in two tight five-set matches last season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One year ago Saturday, Brown (1-0, 0-0) traveled to Harvard Stadium for the Ivy League opener in its 2021 season, and the large contingent of Harvard (1-0, 0-0) fans in attendance at the game were treated to a blowout, as the hosts came out victorious, 49-17. The rivals will face off again on Saturday, this time in Providence, R.I., at 12:30 p.m., and despite last year’s lopsided result last year and Harvard’s historic success against the Bears – the Crimson hold an 88-30-2 record all-time in the series – senior running back Aidan Borguet expects a new challenge.
“Absolutely not,” answered Borguet when asked whether last year’s game impacted his team’s mentality entering the contest. “This is a new team. We’re a new team, and we have to prepare for Brown just as we would any other team, any other week, and that’s with a clean slate…They’re a hungry team.”
This Brown team joined most of its Ivy League counterparts in victory last week (Yale was the lone Ivy to lose last weekend in its season opener) by eking out a 44-38, double-overtime shootout against Bryant at home. Junior quarterback and Everett, Mass. native Jake Willcox played tenaciously for the Bears, who trailed for most of the game but patiently chipped away at the Bulldogs’ lead. The Brown running back corps provided a spark when needed as well, with sophomore Jordan DeLucia blazing past the defense for a 50-yard score in the first quarter and senior Allen Smith hitting paydirt for the winning score in the second overtime.
Harvard also enters the game undefeated after a furious fourth-quarter comeback and a 25-yard score on the first play of overtime led to a 28-21 overtime victory over Merrimack, which put up a valiant effort in the first-ever contest between the two schools. The defense was stellar, recording nine sacks and holding the Warriors to negative-26 rushing yards, giving the offense its chance to rally. Borguet scored the Crimson’s final three touchdowns, including a 48-yard rush with fewer than five minutes remaining that cut the deficit to one score. A Second-Team All-Ivy selection in his sophomore campaign, he is off to a great start in his senior season, as he earned Ivy League Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts. After his offense was held to seven points in the first 55 minutes of game play on Friday, Borguet expects more urgency from Harvard on Saturday.
“We have leaders all around the team that are urging us to start fast,” he said. “We want to get up and play the way we want to early in the game so we can get the ball rolling early and then continue that the rest of the game.”
In the Ivy League, known for its emphasis on stopping the run – through one week of games, the top four rushing defenses in FCS all play in the Ancient Eight – Harvard’s chances of winning will largely depend on Borguet. In his award-winning week, the senior took his 20 carries for 127 yards and two scores, and added another two catches, 39 yards, and a touchdown as a pass-catcher. After recording just six receptions through his first two collegiate seasons, Borguet’s getting more involved in the passing game could prove a key new element to offensive coordinator Mickey Fein’s unit this season. Likewise, for the star to find holes to run through, the offensive line will have to be stouter than it was against Merrimack, when the Warriors’ front seven hurried senior quarterback Charlie Dean five times.
Last season, the Crimson heavily relied on the rush, but when it takes to the air, its hopes will rest on the shoulders of Dean. The Odessa, Fla. native started five games last season before suffering an injury in the Princeton contest, and he was choppy in his return to action, completing 18 of his 35 passes for 166 yards while throwing two interceptions. However, he was better in the fourth quarter and overtime, completing a 35-yard strike late in the game to senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly. Beyond Wimberly, Dean will have a large and diverse set of options to throw to: sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch and junior wide receiver Kaedyn Odermann are jump-ball threats, and a pair of tight ends – junior Tyler Neville and senior Haven Montefalco – made important contributions against Merrimack.
Hatch, Odermann, Neville, and Montefalco will need to use their size to their advantage against Brown, which boasts a large and athletic defense. Almost all of the Bears’ starters stand over six feet tall, and one of the only players who does not – five-foot-ten senior outside linebacker and captain Junior Gafa – is arguably the best player on the team, as he was an All-Ivy League Second Team selection in 2021. Last weekend against Bryant, Gafa recorded two hurries against Bulldogs’ quarterback Zevi Eckhaus, and tied for second on the team with five tackles. The Bears’ defense also excels at forcing turnovers, for senior safety Harrison Ochs and senior defensive back Cooper DeVeau each notched an interception. Junior defensive lineman Terrence Lane II recorded Brown’s only sack last week.
“They are a well-coached team that flies around and plays good football,” Borguet said. “So I think we try to focus on what we can do to the best of our ability and our coaching staff has really harped on that, about playing our best football.”
On the defensive side, the Crimson will try to leverage its experience and pedigree to contain Willcox and head coach James Perry’s deep stable of ball carriers. In the secondary, senior defensive back James Herring and senior linebacker Jack McGowan will try to follow up a relatively pedestrian game against Merrimack, in which the pass defense allowed 309 yards through the air, by clamping down on Bears receivers Graham Walker and Wes Rockett. Walker, who stands at 6’3” and torched Bryant for 116 yards last week, will be a tough task to cover, but Harvard will still look to return to its ball-hawking ways of last season — in seven Ivy League games last year, the Crimson had 11 interceptions — at the Bears’ expense.
The run defense will be expected to continue its stout play, even against a strong crop of running backs headlined by Smith, DeLucia, and sophomore back Stockton Owen. Two of Harvard’s premier run-stuffers, senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec and junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, will arrive in Providence with some new accolades and sterling Week 1 performances to build on. Senior lineman Leskovec, who had a school-record 4.5 sacks against Merrimack last Friday, took home the NCAA FCS Player of the Week award, while Griffith led the team with nine tackles (four for a loss) last week and earned an Honorable Mention for that award. Looking at the Brown contest, Leskovec still sees room for improvement in his individual approach.
“For me over these next couple of games, it’s really about settling down and really honing in on my techniques, and not just flying around with my head cut off like I did last game,” he said.
While Leskovec’s head-flying-around mindset still seemed to yield dividends against the Warriors, he signaled that the Crimson might be in for a different type of challenge against the Bears, a schematic one.
“We’ll put extra emphasis on the different types of schemes and places they run because they’re a little unique,” Leskovec said. “They’ll stay with the run game because that’s kind of what they have to do to set up some of the other plays in their playbook.”
Harvard will look to put together a full-team effort on Saturday and show that it has fully shaken off its offensive rust. Last season, the Crimson put up 30 or more points in four of its first five games and won all of those contests, but this season it remains to be seen if the team will be more reliant on its premier defense to close out games. With senior defensive lineman Truman Jones serving as the 148th Captain of Harvard Football this season, it isn’t hard to envision the unit emerging as the team’s emotional engine.
Saturday’s game will have a special aura around it, as it marks the opening game of conference play for both teams. Historically, the Crimson is 22-5 in its Ivy League season openers under head coach Tim Murphy, who, in his 28th season on the sidelines, is the winningest head coach in Ivy League history. Getting off to a 1-0 start in Providence would be an important first step in Harvard’s quest to win its first conference title since 2015. But Leskovec and the rest of the squad aren’t getting ahead of themselves just yet.
“We have a long way to go,” the senior defender said. “Hopefully, toward the end of the season, we play hard, fast, physical football and we like where we end up.”
For Crimson fans who cannot make the 46-minute train journey to Rhode Island, Saturday’s game can be streamed on ESPN+ and NESN+ and will be carried over the air by WRCA on 1330 AM, 106.1 FM, or 92.9 FM-HD2.

Passio GO! The literal bane of my existence. The shuttle tracking app just got a brand spanking new update in time for this school year. Apparently, the app “has been improved and is easier to use.” But any developer that has to explicitly state that its app is now “easier to use” is most definitely doing something wrong, and Passio GO!’s 1.4 App Store star rating proves as much.
While it’s frankly apparent that Passio GO!’s updates have not made the app “easier to use,” I’ll happily outline my grievances anyway:
Icon
The icon. Why does a map pin need a shadow? Why is the app the exact same rancid green color as Duo Mobile? My life is already confusing as it is.
Usability 
Once you open the app, it's immediately overwhelming and extremely unclear how to do anything.
It took me a long time to figure out you have to click the colorful circle of pain to see how far away the shuttle is from your stop, an even longer time to figure out that to see the order of stops you have to go to Routes < Schedule (or, you can click on Stops to see basically the same information in a more confusing and less helpful way), and an even longer time to realize that the shuttles do not actually follow the stated schedule. I truly find it easiest to locate the physical shuttle on the map and gauge how long it will take before it reaches my stop.
Kheath513 (from the App Store) stated it best in their scathing review: “The app [is] unusable. Half the time it says no connection and [half the time] it’s wrong. I just want to know when my bus will get there. That shouldn’t be that hard.” 
Another thing that I really don’t understand: In the Stops section it gives distance in feet, but the map gives distance in meters. Perhaps, they were trying to accommodate people who use different measurement systems. But, really? I can’t see why it’s necessary to go against convention in this way that would confuse people from literally any part of the world.
In an informal poll of my friends, 100 percent said they did not understand how to use Passio GO! The App Store says ages four and up, but I don’t think any level of education could prepare someone to navigate this app meant to help people navigate. Especially not prekindergarten.
Aesthetics 
The app interior is so ugly.
Look, I get it. Making an app is difficult (it's not like 50% of the Harvard student body has done it). My true grievance is that Passio GO! is a prime example of Quad negligence. Many quadlings rely on the shuttle system to get to class, especially in less-than-ideal weather. But Passio GO! makes the task unnecessarily difficult. Please, please just improve Passio GO! My sanity and the sanity of the two friends I polled will thank you.
