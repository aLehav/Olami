After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Well, it was no Coldplay-Bruno Mars-Beyonce (for this writer), but Lady Gaga turned in one of the most memorable Super Bowl halftime shows ever.
The Washington Post writes that Gaga “avoid[ed] politics.” FAKE NEWS! (For what it’s worth, Fox and Breitbart had similarly mystifying takes.) In addition to choosing the inextricably political “Born This Way” from her rich catalogue of huge hits, she sang a brief patriotic medley in front of a dazzling display of light-emitting drones in the shape of the American flag. “One nation,” she told the camera—seeming to emphasize the “one”—"under God, indivisible, with liberty...and justice...for all.” After the NRA bizarrely took it upon themselves to tell her to avoid politics, Gaga tailored her statement to be as irreproachable as possible—how can you criticize the Pledge of Allegiance?—while reminding an audience of 100 million of the nation’s core values. Especially during one of the most rancorous periods in decades, with heated debate focused on President Trump’s immigration restrictions, it’s impossible to read the show’s first minutes as apolitical. (Unless, apparently, you’re a WaPo critic.)
In total, Gaga raced through a whopping 13 songs, including brief shoutouts (“I’m on the edge!” she cried just after sticking the stadium-jump landing). According to the Wikipedia list of Super Bowl halftime shows, that ranks as the most ever. The pace might have delighted Gaga fans eager to hear their favorite track, but it made for a somewhat frenetic set—and transitions like that between the synthpop smash “Just Dance” and “Million Reasons,” a piano ballad from her latest album “Joanne,” created some pretty extreme mood whiplash. Still, the long setlist reminded us that, unlike some recent headliners like pre-“Uptown Funk” Bruno Mars, Gaga had the lasting star power and discography depth to stuff the show with beloved tunes. And considering that Gaga appeared to be throwing herself into the physical performance, she acquitted herself very well in her live singing.
Besides, regardless of how many Gaga anthems have dominated the airwaves in the last decade, the real appeal of a Gaga performance has always been the theater. There was no meat dress, but a leap off the roof of the stadium? Mid-air dance moves and flips? Singing “Born This Way” to Mike Pence? Actually catching a football? These images will undoubtedly go down in Super Bowl halftime lore. (Between the football catch and the stylish shoulderpad costume, Ms. Germanotta suddenly made it weird that halftime acts never acknowledge their immediate context.) Here’s to more halftime shows like Lady Gaga’s relentlessly bold, energetic, and winkingly political spectacular—as long as they aren’t followed up by a Tom Brady comeback.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If you voted for Trump, I hate you.”
This statement, which appeared on many Harvard students’ Facebook feeds in the aftermath of Election 2016, perhaps most succinctly encapsulates the anger with which that election’s results were received here.
It is a painful, dire expression. Given the caustic rhetoric and distressing policies that led up to the election, it is perhaps understandable. But due to its sweeping bitterness, the remark is symptomatic of dangerous disconnects between Harvard University and the country beyond it.
Hate is a grave emotion, and its use here suggests that one's vote for president is increasingly viewed as character-determining. It reflects the record high sentiment among partisans that the opposition threatens the nation. It hints at the zero-sum game into which Election 2016 twisted identity politics. More than anything else, it cries out for us, as students and global citizens, to do a better job of listening to each other and empathizing with others’ decisions.
Anyone here at Harvard during the days following November 8th―when campus felt like a surreal mix between The Twilight Zone and The Walking Dead―would have recognized the degree to which the election’s results shocked and hurt our community. Indeed, more than 87 percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates preferred the losing candidate. This is unsurprising: significant parts of the campaign’s rhetoric were hostile to many of our ideals and our people. But while no one should be in the business of telling others how to feel, hatred is a response that if left unexamined risks harmful festering.
If we at Harvard aspire to be effective leaders and compassionate people, we must be willing to disarm and discuss. Removing the poison from our language is probably a good way to start: “If you voted for Trump, I hate you.” The central problem with those who, disappointed by President Trump’s victory, responded by condemning those who voted for him is that this generalizes Trump voters as hate-deserving. This begets hypocrisy: if anti-Trumpers disapprove of Mr. Trump’s generalizations of Mexicans, Muslims, women, and others, they must take care to not themselves cope with loss by levying stereotypes.
Those unconvinced by this argument might insist that all Trump voters are in fact hate-deserving because they supported, or at least weren’t sufficiently bothered by, a candidate’s racism, sexism, and xenophobia. This retort would be complicated by the people who voted for Obama twice in key states like Pennsylvania and Michigan but who switched to Trump in 2016 and seem to have been crucial to Trump’s victory. The 29 percent of Hispanic voters and 42 percent of female voters who chose Trump further complicate sweeping claims. Evidently, perceptions vary greatly.
Democrats at Harvard and across the country make a grave political and moral misstep if, instead of analyzing why their platform fell short, they blame bad people rather than bad policy. While “-isms” may certainly have been motivating factors for some Trump voters, neglecting other factors like economics is a mistake.
For example, consider someone who lives in eastern Ohio, who voted for Obama twice but is facing rising prices and layoffs, who is confronted by rising healthcare costs and falling life expectancy, and who is called deplorable by a wealthy coastal liberal. People like this certainly exist, and they may lack the privilege we at Harvard have to evaluate a candidate’s pros and cons differently. Their vote for Trump should not earn them hate; it should earn them our earnest, problem-solving attention.
Hurling hate upon Trump voters is unhelpful and unwise. That some Americans were economically or otherwise desperate enough to weigh his promises greater than his denigrations is a phenomenon that should concern Democrats, not enrage them. That loyal members of the Democratic base were hurting enough to de-prioritize the race and gender issues they previously rallied behind should encourage analysis, not elicit scorn. We’ll have enough walls without raising mental ones between us. We must not let our humanity be this election’s casualty.
Many have observed that the echo chamber generated by Harvard’s lack of ideological diversity may discourage attempts to listen deeper. But we can take steps to be more productive political actors. In casual political conversations, we shouldn’t assume our peers think as we do and automatically speak derisively of the other side―this bankrupts the discussion. We should seek exposure to varied news sources, because to develop our arguments we must test our worldviews, not indulge them. To advance the cause of mindful civic participation, we ought to seek reasoned truth rather than psychological confirmation.
Just because the blue-collar Democrat who helped swing the election to President Trump lacks a seat in our wood-paneled halls does not mean she doesn’t exist and it does not mean she is somehow hateful, irredeemable, or lesser. It means we have to do a better job of checking emotion, invoking thoughtfulness, and reaching out. Hopefully we are successful in encouraging productive dialogue so that politics may again be about building each other up rather than tearing down the other 49 percent.
Because as it always should, love trumps hate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People in the United States were “praying, crying, fleeing frantically to escape death,” according to public opinion scholar Hadley Cantril. The year was 1938, and Orson Welles’s “War of the Worlds,” a fictional story of a Martian invasion, was being broadcast by CBS Radio, reaching an audience of millions. What followed, so the story goes, was a mass panic across the country. The listeners who tuned in following the start of the program missed the introduction which provided context for the broadcast, and some believed that a Martian invasion was really taking place. But how many?
Today, the alarm raised by politicians, researchers, and technology companies of all stripes about what they view as an epidemic of fake news on social media platforms echoes the concerns raised about “War of the Worlds.” Facebook recently launched a project in collaboration with five outside entities, including news organizations, to fact-check the news reports that appear on its platform and verify their accuracy. The problem of fake news even made an appearance in President Obama’s farewell address on January 10, 2017.
It would seem that fake news on social media is our modern-day “War of the Worlds” crisis — except that the supposed crisis following the “War of the Worlds” broadcast hardly took place. Perhaps the best documentation of listeners’ reactions was the thousands of letters written to the Federal Communications Commission, CBS, Orson Welles, and producer Richard Wilson in the following days. In fact, only six out of 1,974 letter writers reported fleeing their homes in terror. One listener wryly noted in a letter to the FCC that he “did not jump out of the window, did not attempt suicide, did not break [his] arm while beating a hasty retreat from [his] apartment…” after listening to the broadcast. The listener further noted that none of his co-workers reported having believed the broadcast, either.
Why, then, was public reaction to the broadcast so exaggerated? It was at least in part because newspapers, resentful of their displacement by the advent of radio, had used the opportunity to discredit the new medium by trying to define it in the public mind as lacking the credibility of print journalism.
Without suggesting similar motives today, it is worth asking whether people are taken in by the fictional world fake news portrays, as listeners supposedly were to the War of the Worlds broadcast eight decades ago. It is true that fake news articles related to the 2016 presidential election in the United States were wildly popular. Indeed, they achieved higher engagement on Facebook than factually correct stories, according to an analysis conducted by BuzzFeed. Even so, according to a separate BuzzFeed study, only 18% of social media users trust news on Facebook “all or most of the time.” This parallels the reaction to the “War of the Worlds” broadcast. Even though millions listened to it, very few seemed to have had trouble distinguishing fact from fiction.
The 1938 broadcast suggests that fake news is not a new phenomenon, but this does not mean that social media companies should disregard its proliferation. Instead, the “War of the Worlds” affair suggests that worry over fake news to some extent is misplaced; the scale at which it is produced and disseminated, the lucrative potential profits to be made, and the political context in which it is consumed are different today, and all present possible cause for alarm. However, in tackling fake news, “War of the Worlds” offers the lesson that readers themselves may not be as gullible as they seem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Amorino Gelato and Sweet Pizza looking to open stores on JFK Street, Harvard Square continues a recent trend of welcoming upscale food venues. Recently, Blue Bottle, a cafe described by one student as “yet another bougie addition,” announced its arrival in Harvard Square by next summer. And it's hard to forget that Panera Bread abruptly closed just last year, only to be replaced by its far more expensive cousin, Tatte.
Whether or not you appreciate Tatte’s polished white brick and marble interior, its presence reflects a pressing fact: there are fewer and fewer affordable food options in Harvard Square. While this trend may inconvenience many, it will most directly impact the college experiences of low-income students. It is very likely that the rising costs of restaurants will continue to exacerbate divides within the student body along socioeconomic lines because of who can and cannot afford to eat in the Square.
In recent years, administrators and students alike have been aware of the issue. When talking about the newly implemented start-up grant, former Undergraduate Council president Shaiba Rather ’17 explicitly acknowledged the issue of restaurant affordability, saying “it can be really overwhelming when your roommates or all your friends are eating out every day.” The College's new start-up grant, given to incoming freshmen from households making $65,000 or less, is an important first step in ensuring equal participation in campus life regardless of socioeconomic background. Given the intense debates about social inclusivity on campus, fueled by a running conversation on unrecognized single-sex social organizations, these grants are imperative. They are a tangible and uncontroversial way to promote inclusivity, and we hope that this ongoing three-year pilot program proves the continued need for these grants.
That said, there are still many shortcomings with the College’s support of low-income students. The start-up grant is new, having only been established this past fall and, as a pilot program, it is only guaranteed to freshmen until the Class of 2022. Additionally, it does not address the financial constraints that low-income upperclassmen face: students ought to be supported all four years of college, not just freshman year. Finally, students from households just above the $65,000 threshold do not qualify. All these issues pose challenges that Harvard should help address.
The administration can help support low-income students given the changing urban landscape of Harvard Square, but it is important that peers also shoulder some of the responsibility. All students should be sensible and empathetic when making plans, for instance by proposing a meal in a dining hall instead of in the Square to help ensure financial accessibility for all parties.
The increased presence of upscale restaurants will inevitably affect Harvard students, and it is important that students and administrators alike acknowledge that it will do so unequally across socioeconomic levels. As Harvard Square changes, it is imperative that the College’s financial aid and support for low-income students changes as well.

The call was long distance.
Niku Jafarnia, a student at Harvard Law School, dialed her mother and father in the Bay Area, where the couple, who emigrated from Iran in the 1970s, has lived for over twenty years.
Jafarnia asked them about President Donald Trump’s immigration suspension: A few days earlier, the president had signed an executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iran, for 90 days.
She hoped for reassurance. In the past, her parents had always told her not to worry about “these types” of things. They had been through much worse, they said.
This call was different.
“For the first time in her life, my mother said, ‘You know what, maybe it’s a good idea for us not to be living in this country,’” Jafarnia says.
Since its passage almost two weeks ago on Jan. 27, Trump’s order has sparked protests, lawsuits, administrative turmoil, and widespread uncertainty among United States residents with ties to the seven countries—Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—on the president’s list.
Harvard currently hosts 111 student and scholar visa holders who are nationals of the countries named in Trump’s act, according to the Harvard International Office, which processes visas for University affiliates. When Trump signed the order, the University was in the middle of processing visas for 21 additional scholars from these countries.
For its part, Harvard has taken a number of steps to challenge the order and provide resources for affiliates affected by it, including lobbying lawmakers, filing legal arguments, and hosting a town hall event.
Still, Harvard students and scholars impacted by the suspension say they are still trying to grasp its exact implications for their work at the University, their families, and their futures in the United States. Many say they are struggling to understand the reason for the order, which they call unjust.
Sitting in a Law School classroom, fidgeting with her red “Criminal Law” textbook, Jafarnia says she found her phone call with her mother and father “heartbreaking.” Her parents told her they were so anxious about Trump’s order they had stopped sleeping.
“They moved here to give us a better life, and they don’t want to see us dealing with these things,” Jafarnia says. “And they shouldn’t have to deal with it all over again—it’s the same thing, and they emigrated here 40 years ago.”
‘YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE’
For Mohsen Goudarzi and Narges Afshordi, a married couple who traveled from Iran eight years ago to do research and pursue postgraduate degrees at Stanford and now Harvard, Trump’s suspension made a bad situation worse.
Seated next to her husband in a cafe, hair covered in a bright hijab, Afshordi squints a little in the sunlight streaming in from the cafe’s large windows as she tries to explain.
“All of the things in the news make it sound like there was no vetting or there was just vetting for refugees, but there has been really pretty extreme vetting for Iranians coming to the United States forever,” she says.
Afshordi, who is studying psychology at Harvard, recalls how she and her husband, soon after graduating college in Iran, had waited months to obtain valid travel visas. Once they arrived in the United States, the couple did not leave the country again for over three years, even though their family remained in Iran.
The two were too scared to visit home, Afshordi says, worried they might not be able to come back to the United States if they did.
“It wasn’t unheard of that people would leave in the middle of their studies, and then they wouldn’t be able to obtain a visa to come back to the United States,” Goudarzi, who is studying religion, adds.
Eventually, Afshordi and Goudarzi began to take a few trips—to Iran to see their parents, to Europe for vacation. Still, nearly every time they left the United States, they were subjected to extensive questioning on their return, Goudarzi says. These sessions often took hours.
Leaning back in her chair, Afshordi recalls one occasion when she flew back to Boston after a visit to Spain. She was pregnant at the time, and had just debarked from a nearly eight-hour flight, she says. Airport security officials pulled her aside immediately.
“They kept asking me things they already had answers to, and then also weird questions like, ‘Were you in Iran?’” she remembers. “No, I was coming back from a visit to Spain. ‘Did you go to Syria?’ No, why are you asking me?”
Afshordi and Goudarzi have a one-and-a-half year old daughter. She has met her grandparents just once, when Afshordi and Goudarzi visited Iran over a year ago.
Though Afshordi’s parents have applied for visas to visit the United States multiple times over the past three years, their bids have been rejected every time, Afshordi says. Afshordi’s mother, a psychologist, was unable to be with Afshordi when she gave birth, Goudarzi notes.
The couple had just begun to “make peace” with the fact that their daughter would likely be three years old before she met any of her extended family when Trump signed the order, Afshordi says. Now, visits are out of the question.
“It’s been very, very difficult,” Goudarzi says. “Now it’s impossible.”
Afshordi says the days since the immigration order took effect have been “completely not productive.” She says she and her husband “do whatever is necessary” and spend the rest of their time glued to the news, checking for updates.
Goudarzi passes a hand over his eyes and looks quickly at his wife.
“If there is, now, a death in the family, then you have to choose,” he says, slowly. “You have to choose between either finishing your studies or going back and attending the funeral. Even if it’s your brother or your father.”
‘WILL WE BE ALLOWED IN?’
Ziad Reslan says he fell in love with the United States as a kid. Reslan, who was born and raised in Lebanon and whose father is Syrian, used to practice speaking English for hours, trying “very hard” not to have an accent.
Inspired by “what America has done” in the world, Reslan decided to pursue a career in international affairs. He dreamed of attending Harvard and traveling around the world. Now a student at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, he says he felt close to his goal, at least until the immigration order.
“I have conferences planned. I’m supposed to be going to Dubai next week for the World Government Summit, which is a conference that President Obama spoke at last year, and I’m one of four representatives from the Kennedy School,” he says.
Reslan, who has Syrian citizenship, is no longer sure he can go.
Apart from personal troubles, Reslan says he worries Trump’s immigration suspension will have a “chilling effect” on academics around the world who want to come to the United States. As an example, he cites the “Emirates Leadership Initiative Fellowship,” a program run by the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership that brings ten scholars from the Middle East to study at Harvard each year.
Reslan, an Emirates fellow, notes that, under the restrictions of Trump’s order, half of the current class of Emirates fellows would be unable to enter the United States.
He recalls an online admissions session for the program held a few days ago, when he heard questions from applicants for next year’s iteration of the fellowship. Reslan says every single attendee asked the same question.
“They are not even asking questions about what it is like to be at Harvard, what kind of courses can you take. Literally every question has been, ‘Will I be allowed in?’” he says. “And Harvard can’t say yes—it’s still up in the air.”
Reslan says Trump’s immigration suspension, and the closed-borders ideology it champions, may eliminate “the exact cultural exchange” of knowledge “we would want to happen,” especially at Harvard. He adds he is concerned that other nations may follow the example of the United States and start shuttering their borders, too.
At one point in the past two weeks, Reslan says, he started to question his childhood dreams. For the first time since he came to the United States, he asked himself, “If this place doesn’t want me, then why I am I staying here?”
But last Sunday, he says, something happened that convinced him to stay at Harvard. That weekend, Reslan was staffing a Center for Public Leadership program, called the Middle Eastern Refugee Service Initiative, that gathers together Arabic-speaking Harvard students and refugees from Syria and Iraq—mostly between 16 and 20 years of age—who have resettled in Boston.
The idea behind the day-long event was to start a “social connection,” he explains. The only rules were that no one could say the words “Trump” or “refugee.”
At the end of the day, Reslan recalls, a young Syrian refugee forced to take a five-year hiatus from school approached and thanked him, but said she was disappointed. She wanted to know why she had not received admissions materials.
“In that moment, Trump didn’t matter; immigration law didn’t matter. This 20-year-old woman who has been out of school for five years wants to come to Harvard,” Reslan says.
‘DON’T LABEL US’
It is Monday, and Professor Ali Khademhosseini’s laboratory at Harvard Medical School is buzzing with people. Some researchers tap furiously at computers. Others bustle by with pipettes and trays.
The room hums with different languages as scientists eddy in corners to compare data and discuss experiments. Ali Tamayol, an instructor in the laboratory, crosses his arms, glances around, and smiles.
“This lab is probably one of the most multinational and multicultural labs in Boston, and actually this is one of the most productive labs in the Boston area,” he says. “I think that’s an important fact.”
Khademhosseini’s laboratory boasts more than a dozen affiliates who come from countries listed on Trump’s order. In the wake of the immigration order, some of these scientists say they may leave the United States to pursue their research elsewhere.
Elmira Jalilian, an Iranian researcher in the laboratory who uses 3D-printing technology to engineer artificial muscles, says the executive order changed her “entire plan.” Jalilian, who moved to Boston seven months ago and hoped to earn a permanent position at Harvard, notes the suspension prevents her from visiting her family, many of whom live in Iran. She says she does not want to work in a country where she cannot see her family.
“I moved to work here at Harvard because everyone knows Boston is the best place to work in most research areas, especially my field,” Jalilian says. But right now, “I am not welcome here—I won’t be able to go back home to visit my family and they can’t come here.”
“This is a very important issue for me, and I will consider going somewhere else,” she adds.
Elaheh Zare, an Iranian scientist in the lab studying anticancer drugs, agrees with Jalilian. She says she would rather live in a place “where they respect other nationalities.”
Tamayol says the order has placed many in the laboratory in Jalilian and Zare’s situation: unable to travel, separated from their families. Iranian engineer Pooria Mostafalu, who also works in the laboratory, nods and notes he has not seen his relatives in Iran for over three years.
Mostafalu says he is working on developing smart, wearable devices that can be used to help monitor and treat diseases. He adds he came to the United States for “science, science, science,” and says he does not understand why Trump’s order would target researchers like himself and his colleagues.
“We are here to solve the problems in healthcare in the United States and to contribute in any way we can. That’s why I’m here,” he says. “There is a disease in politics. We are asking other people, other experts [to] solve this disease in politics.”
Mostafalu pauses and looks around. “We are hoping this kind of ban can be dissolved. There must be some kind of treatment for this disease.”
Jalilian adds that she does not see how Trump will make America “great” by disincentivizing “highly skilled” engineers and scientists from coming to the country. She warns that science moves quickly and that, if Trump’s immigration suspension remains in place, the United States may lose its leadership in the field.
Tamayol shakes his head in agreement.
“It’s not only overlooking the value of what we are doing in terms of science, or research, or developments,” he says slowly. “It’s overlooking our value as human beings.”
All are quiet.
Suddenly, Jalilian pulls out a much-scribbled and well-worn piece of paper. She consulted with other members of the lab, she says, and they have a message for Trump.
“We would like to say,” she reads, “Don’t label us because of our nationality. We are scientists, and science doesn’t have any borders.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has neared hiring an equal share of male and female ladder faculty members, the diversity of the body remains “concerning,” Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser said at the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday.
The Faculty also approved the withdrawal of former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68’s motion against the College’s sanctions on unrecognized single gender social organizations. Though Lewis withdrew his motion in late January, the motion—and a Faculty Council-backed counter-motion to indefinitely postpone it—were technically still on the table for discussion at the meeting.
No Faculty members objected to the withdrawal of both motions, ending the latest chapter in Lewis’s months-long campaign against the sanctions.
Zipser’s presentation, postponed for several meetings due to heated debate over Lewis’s motion, outlined recent Faculty trends in hiring and promotion. According to Zipser, 29 percent of the Faculty are women and 21 percent are racial minorities. While the proportion of women in the Faculty has increased in recent years, the hiring of racial minorities has largely plateaued, she said.
This academic year, 52 percent of incoming ladder faculty were women, according to Zipser’s report. But last academic year, 38 percent of external ladder faculty offers went to women.
“We need to remain incredibly vigilant here,” she said.
Zipser also detailed struggles women may face in the academic environment, including a lack of mentoring on work-life balance and more pressure to serve on administrative committees.
"Women feel that they are doing more committee service than men because we are constantly asking women to serve on committees,” she said.
While Zipser dedicated less time to hiring trends among minority faculty, she reported that while there has been an increase in the number of Asian faculty members, hiring of underrepresented minorities has plateaued.
After Zipser’s presentation, government professor Harvey C. Mansfield '53 questioned whether the University was employing “quotas” for women and minorities.
“There’s a great difference between a search which is made for the best candidate and one which is made with a quota in mind,” Mansfield said.
“For example, in my department the women have taken to voting in a bloc for any women that comes up,” he continued.
Zipser said that the University does not use quotas in its hiring processes.
“We want faculty to hire the very best candidate that there is,” she said. “And we believe that there is untapped talent among women and minorities.”
Zipser’s presentation followed the Faculty’s final withdrawal of Lewis’s motion. At the meeting, Docket Committee Chair Parimal G. Patil discussed the history of the motion and December’s counter-motion—which would have postponed discussion of Lewis’ motion indefinitely—and announced that they were both technically still open for Faculty discussion.
On Jan. 25, Khurana announced a new faculty committee will examine the current policy, which, starting with the class of 2021, prohibits members of the organizations from holding club and sports team leadership positions and receiving College endorsement for post-graduate scholarships. Lewis withdrew his motion in a letter to Khurana shortly afterwards.
University President Drew G. Faust was met with silence when she then asked if there were any objections to withdrawing Lewis and the Faculty Council’s respective motions.
Members of the Faculty also received an update from Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris on the status of the relatively new Biomedical Engineering concentration.
“It is a program that we think is healthy,” Harris said. “We think it's a tribute to our larger offerings both in engineering and in the life sciences as it bridges those two domains.”
At the end of the meeting, the Faculty heard a proposal by Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard to create a Master’s degree program in Data Science. The proposed program would be a combined effort between the Statistics and Computer Science departments. The Faculty did not vote to approve or deny the proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new policy will allow first-year students to reserve freshman dorm common rooms for private events, continuing a College-wide push to re-center social life in residential spaces.
The Freshman Dean’s Office announced the revised rule in an email to members of the Class of 2020 Tuesday. The new guidelines will allow students to host private events like birthday parties and movie nights in dorm common rooms, according to Michael C. Ranen, the resident dean for Ivy Yard. Previously, events reserved in dorm lounges had to be open to all first-year students and were advertised in the FDO’s weekly bulletin.
Ranen said he credits the new policy to the work of former Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17, whose agenda last year focused on strengthening first-year social life. Rather and Banks worked closely with Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in establishing the new policy, according to Ranen.
“The FDO and the College at large have always been trying to identify social spaces for first-year students,” Ranen said. “We want to make sure that freshmen have social opportunities in a safe environment.”
Freshman dorm common rooms will be available for reservation between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. on either Friday or Saturday nights, but not both. Students must submit event forms on Thursday before the event at the latest.
“We still want to preserve the spaces for students who just want to gather in an informal basis,” Ranen said.
First-year students may also apply to have their event funded by the FDO through the “First Year FUNd” program. As before, students are required to meet with the FDO to discuss their events as well as a potential budget. Past events funded by the First Year Fund program have typically been smaller-scale occasions under 50 people and have cost between $75 and $100.
Although proctors will not be directly supervising common room events, they will communicate with the host prior to the occasion. Dean Lee, a freshman proctor in Greenough Hall, said that he thinks the policy is an improvement, but supervision fall more heavily on proctors who live near the common spaces.
“I would treat it as any other people having an event in their own suite and I would still feel responsible to check in if it’s getting really out of control,” Lee said. “I think it will be helpful to prevent conflicts between people who want to use the room to study, versus people who want to have their own events.”
Creating social spaces for first-year undergraduates has been a priority of College administrators in recent years. In 2015, the student body voted to reject a ballot referendum by the Undergraduate Council that proposed turning Pusey Library, an underground repository containing the University’s archives and map collection, into a “freshmen-oriented social space.”
The College and FDO have attempted to address criticisms about a lack of freshman social spaces through funding “inclusive” College-wide parties and large-group social outings to Boston.
Arnav Agrawal ’20, a UC representative for Crimson Yard, said he thinks the new rules are better because they will allow freshmen to take more responsibility for hosting private events.
“I think it’s definitely a welcome move because it allows students greater access to affordable accessible social spaces on campus,” Agrawal said. “We’ve been seeing a lot of community conversations around that on this campus—where we have a dearth of social spaces—and that problem is aggravated for freshmen.”
The new rule will more closely mirror policies in the upperclassman residential Houses that allow students to book common spaces, like the Mather Junior Common Room and Cabot Aquarium, for parties. Unlike in the Houses, however, alcohol will continue to be banned in freshman dorms.
Ranen reiterated that the FDO’s alcohol policy will be enforced during private events held in freshman dorm common rooms.
“There is no alcohol allowed in the Yard and that will be strictly monitored,” he said.

UPDATED: February 8, 2017 at 4:12 p.m. 
Eight months after the College unveiled a policy that will penalize future members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations, College students still face questions about how the sanctions will be implemented or what form they will take. Formulated behind closed doors by administrators, the policy has been met with protest, resistance from faculty, and—for three unrecognized student groups—changes in membership policies.
Following a recent announcement that a new committee could revise or replace the sanctions, the future for Harvard’s Greek organizations, final clubs, and now, the single-gender social organizations policy itself remains uncertain.
What are the sanctions?
Breaking from the College’s near-three decade long pattern of administrative distance towards its unrecognized social groups, University President Drew G. Faust made the historic move in May 2016 to accept Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s recommended policy to regulate Harvard’s off-campus social life.
The policy—set to start with the Class of 2021—will bar members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities from holding leadership positions in recognized student organizations, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
What do people think of the sanctions?
Many graduate board leaders of male and female final clubs, as well as Greek organizations' national chapters, opposed the policy. The sanctions garnered national attention and sparked strong opinions across campus, with opposition from many students, faculty, and outside observers, and support from some professors, varsity coaches, and members of the Harvard Corporation.
In one of the most visible shows of resistance, hundreds of Harvard women rallied against the policy in Harvard Yard a week after its announcement, arguing it unfairly grouped sororities and female final clubs with the all-male final clubs that had been the focus of most administrative scrutiny.
Meanwhile, others at Harvard stood with the policy, arguing that gender discrimination and socioeconomic exclusivity plague the all-male final clubs.
How did faculty members respond?
Prominent faculty members, including former University President Lawrence H. Summers and former Dean of the College and Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68, publicly criticized the policy. In particular, Lewis and eleven other faculty members drafted a motion opposing the sanctions in May, resolving that “Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join.”  
But other professors, including Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Louis Menand, expressed their support for the policy at Faculty meetings.
How many groups changed their membership policies?
Three unrecognized single-gender social organizations, the Oak Club, the Sablière Society, and the Seneca,  have announced plans to go gender-neutral since the sanction were announced. They join the Spee Club, which allowed women to join in the fall of 2015. Still, seven out of eight of the all-male final clubs remain single-gender—the Fox Club, which briefly flirted with the idea of admitting women, saw a co-ed motion shot down by club alumni.
What did Lewis's motion mean for the sanctions?
No one was quite sure. The motion ignited months of debate between University administrators and members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The Faculty delayed discussing the motion at its October meeting, held an animated debate about the motion in November, and were prepared to vote on the motion in a December meeting before the meeting abruptly ended at the regular end time, tabling further discussion until 2017.
Several professors took issue with the language of Lewis’ motion, which does not refer directly to the policy itself. The Faculty Committee also declined to discuss the policy, citing the same concern.
Lewis said he believed the motion, if approved by the Faculty, would strike down the sanctions. Faust, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—stopped short of confirming this. Faust said in a November 2016 interview that the sanctions could be subject to change, while Lee said in December that the policy itself would not be revoked, though its implementation could determine its impact.
How did the College plan on enforcing the policy?
It's still up in the air.
To implement the sanctions, Khurana assembled a committee of students, staff, and faculty members in Sept. 2016 and charged the committee with crafting recommendations about how to implement and enforce the policy.
The 37-member committee, chaired by Douglas A. Melton, a Faculty Dean of Eliot House and a University Professor, and Kay K. Shelemay, a professor of Music and African American Studies, includes members of final clubs and Greek organizations and at least one athlete. As of January, the committee was on track to hand recommendations to Khurana within several weeks.
What's the deal with the new committee?
Following all of this criticism from faculty members, Khurana announced late January that a second committee would be formed—this time giving faculty a more central role— to evaluate on how best to confront the “problematic impact” of single-gender social organizations. More significantly,the committee will determine whether the current policy should be “revised or replaced.”  
This committee will provide a more structured channel for faculty to voice concern, though it will still include administrators and students. Smith will form the “faculty committee,” which will present recommendations directly to Faust. Khurana’s role in the new committee is uncertain.
Under the new committee, no changes to the current policy could take place without Faust’s stamp of approval. In an interview in January following the faculty committee’s announcement, though, Faust said she would welcome a change to the policy if it improved upon its original form.
What happened to Lewis's motion?
It’s over—for now.
After Khurana announced the new Faculty committee, Lewis withdrew his motion against the sanctions, adding in another letter to Khurana that he was “delighted” at the possibility of changing the policy. But Lewis and several similarly-aligned professors have said they would create another motion if the committee reaffirmed the sanctions “without adequate revision.”
Will the faculty committee interfere with the implementation committee?
Possibly.
Members of the implementation committee—which was close to presenting its findings to Khurana, according to Melton—were not consulted on the formation of the new committee and found out about it just ten minutes before the entire College.
Nonetheless, the implementation committee will still present findings on the current policy to Khurana in the coming weeks, and the policy in its current form will go into effect as planned unless a new policy is approved. However, the faculty committee is scheduled to conclude its work in the fall semester of 2017, and it remains to see what policy the Class of 2021 will be subject to when they arrive—or how soon into their time at Harvard that policy could change.

CORRECTION: February 8, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that final club affiliates played a role in formulating the sanctions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Science welcomed sophomore concentrators in a first-of-its-kind convocation ceremony that featured an alumni panel and a reception with SEAS student organizations.
All 320 sophomore SEAS concentrators—whose addition brings the school to a record-high 943 total concentrators—were invited to attend. Though SEAS Director of Events Susan Forrest said 200 concentrators RSVPed, only some of those students attended the event in Science Center B on a grey Tuesday evening.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff  said the convocation is “one of a number of outcomes we’re experimenting with to create a better community at SEAS. He added that classes of SEAS concentrators aren’t usually all brought together until graduation.
In his welcoming remarks, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III highlighted several SEAS student groups, including Engineers Without Borders and Harvard’s International Genetically Engineered Machine team.
“I could go through many other examples here of the amazing student teams, J-term, and summer term projects,” Doyle said. “These are the opportunities that are available to you, the newly declared concentrators in SEAS: to tackle hands-on projects, learn new skills, to experience different cultures, and work with people with a different perspective.”
SEAS has enjoyed significant and sustained growth since it became a school in 2007. In the 2007-2008 school, year SEAS had 291 undergraduate concentrators. The school’s 934 concentrators constitute roughly one-sixth of Harvard undergraduates.
After his initial remarks, Doyle moderated the alumni panel, directing questions to panelists about their time at SEAS and subsequent career paths.
Joanne B. Chang ’91, the chef and co-owner of Flour Bakery—which recently opened a Harvard Square location—spoke about “trying to find what [made] her heart sing” at SEAS. She graduated with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics before becoming a management consultant and then professional chef.
Eric N. Hysen ’11, the executive director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Digital Service, said he was opposed to concentrating in anything related to math or engineering when he first arrived at Harvard. He ended up concentrating in Computer Science with a secondary in Government, and integrated both as a member of the U.S. Digital Service in the White House.
“I would encourage everyone to look outside of what you’re studying,” Hysen said.
Julie Kitchenka Ferland ’98, General Manager at Shell TechWorks, and Dao Nguyen ’94, a publisher of BuzzFeed, were the ceremony’s other panelists.
A reception followed the panel, and the new concentrators were invited to speak with representatives from an array of engineering-targeted student organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer in Washington, D.C. last month, she told professors at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting.
Specifically, Faust said she spoke to members of Congress about the endowment’s tax-exempt status, research funding, and federal policies protecting undocumented students.
After President Donald Trump’s election in November, Faust said she is “ramping up” efforts to lobby the federal government and announced her plans to travel to Washington, D.C. in January, rather than in April as originally scheduled.
At Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, Faust outlined the three policy areas that she considers priorities in “the evolving political and policy environment.” She initially pointed to these areas at a Faculty meeting in December.
“I noted that there would be three areas of focus—continued advocacy for research support, making the case for the endowment and what it enables, [and] supporting the members of our community, especially those made vulnerable by new initiatives that have been appearing,” Faust said.
These policies face threats from the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers. During his campaign, Trump pledged to nix the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program—established by former President Barack Obama in 2012 to provide legal protections to undocumented young adults—in his first 100 days in office. Trump has said he will make a final decision on DACA in coming weeks.
The University has taken a series of steps to support its undocumented students, who administrators say number around 40. The Harvard University Police Department has pledged not to inquire about the citizenship status of affiliates, and the Law School’s Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic has hired an attorney to provide legal counsel to undocumented affiliates, among other measures.
Faust said she also discussed research funding and Harvard’s endowment with McConnell and Schumer. Faculty have voiced concerns that the University could lose some of its federal research funding, which totaled about $600 million in 2016, under Trump.
Some Republican members of Congress have also questioned the tax-exempt status of large university endowments, and Faust responded to congressional inquiries in a lengthy letter in April, defending Harvard’s tax-exempt designation.
“I think we had some success,” Faust told faculty members Tuesday of her January trip.“We will continue the work of advocacy for our students and our interests.”
Since her trip to Washington, Faust also signed a letter to Trump Thursday calling on him to reverse a recent executive order barring immigrants from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The order has directly impacted Harvard affiliates from the targeted countries, preventing some from entering the United States and jeopardizing visas of more than 100 scholars and students at Harvard.
Harvard’s General Counsel filed an amicus brief Friday in a suit challenging the executive order before a Massachusetts federal court Friday. Faust said Tuesday that she is working with the Massachusetts congressional delegation to assess the damage the order has caused to the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Security, Parking and Museum Guards Union, the University’s smallest union, voted Tuesday to ratify a new contract that offers workers higher pay, more personal days, and a fund to help members pay for health care.
Forty-six members of the 80-person union voted to adopt the contract, while two voted against the contract and one worker was undecided, according to Curt E. Rheault, a union organizer. Many union members did not vote during the two voting sessions that the union held on Monday because of conflicts with work, and the union only counted ballots from members who voted in person.
Even though 31 union members did not vote in the election, 46 votes were enough to ratify the contract. According to the union’s bylaws, a majority of voters in the election must vote to ratify the contract, and that majority must include at least 20 votes.
The University and HUSPMGU reached an agreement on the contract last week after months of negotiations.
Under the new contract, union members will receive a 3 percent pay increase on July 1, 2017, July 1, 2018, and July 1, 2019. In addition, the new contract increases the number of sick days that union members have in their “sick bank”—the number of unused sick days that workers can save to use later—from 25 to 30. They will also have one more sick day per year than under the former contract.
Rheault said that this contract was the first in 14 years that provides HUSPMGU workers with benefits comparable to those available to members of other Harvard unions. For many union members, “this was the first contract where the union hadn’t fallen behind,” Rheault said.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that Harvard provided equitable benefits to HUSPMGU members.
“The HUSPMGU agreement is consistent with other represented groups on campus and provides competitive wages and benefits to those in the respective industries—in this case, Parking and Museum Attendants,” she wrote.
In addition to increasing pay, the contract lowers the cost of health care for HUSPMGU members. On Jan. 1, 2018, the union’s premiums will decrease from 15 percent to 13 percent while cost of co-pays will rise.
To help union employees afford the higher costs of co-payments, the new contract creates a flexible spending account that contains money workers can spend on medical expenses.The University will add $275 to each individual’s account every year starting in 2018.
The new contract will also compensate Museum employees who staff events at an increased rate and provides union members with access to cheaper parking spaces near Harvard Square.
“We asked the members what they liked about and I think what they liked most was that we negotiated for such a long time and they thought we probably got the best we could have gotten,” said Rheault. “They liked the fact that we worked really hard.”
The new contract will be applied retroactively to union members starting on July 1, 2016 and will last until July 1, 2020.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of the Navy Raymond E. Mabus Jr. spoke about the future of warfare and his work with the Navy over the past eight years at an Institute of Politics event in Kirkland House Tuesday evening.
Mabus served during the Obama administration, and oversaw several organizational changes in the United States Navy including the integration of women into all combat positions and the repeal of the controversial “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which prohibited openly gay U.S. citizens from entering the military.
“We want a more diverse force, not for diversity’s sake, but because a more diverse force is a stronger force,” Mabus said. “The only qualification to do the job should be the qualification to do the job…Things like gender, color, sexual orientation, just shouldn’t matter.”
At the event, Mabus spoke about current innovations and future developments in military technology and strategy. The United States military has invested heavily in solar and wind energy, according to the U.S. Army 2014 Sustainability report, which details efforts to reduce waste in military practices.
“We’ve got SEAL teams in the field that are net zero in terms of water or energy,” Mabus said.
During his tenure as Navy secretary, Mabus made climate change a trademark issue for the branch. On Tuesday, Mabus reiterated that he considers climate change a national security issue that, if left unchecked, would result in physical danger to the United States.
Mabus said rising sea levels could destroy naval bases or entire cities. Additionally, as storms get more and more violent, Mabus said Marines will be put in greater danger as they respond to more intense natural disasters around the world.
Mabus also spoke about ethical questions on the use of unmanned drone strikes and the future of modern warfare, and said railguns—which eject projectiles that can break through many solid surfaces—are particularly strong prospects for future weapons development.
Towards the end of the event, Mabus stressed to attendees the necessity for adaptation and flexibility in future defense strategies.
“Nothing is permanent, nothing is immutable.” Mabus said. “And if you start thinking that way, you become defeatable.”

Harvard raised $1.19 billion in fiscal year 2016, marking the University's largest fundraising haul in a single year and surpassing Stanford for the first time since 2014, according to the Council for Aid to Education.
Fiscal year 2016 marks the third consecutive year the University has raised over $1 billion since the public launch of its $6.5 billion capital campaign in 2013. As of September, the University had raised more than $7 billion in its record-breaking drive.
For nine out of the last eleven years, Stanford has been more successful than Harvard in its annual fundraising. Stanford drew in $951 million in gifts during fiscal year 2016, according to the Council’s annual study.
This particularly high fundraising figure comes in a year when higher education institutions collected an unprecedented number of donations. According to the study, colleges and universities in the United States collectively raised nearly $41 billion in fiscal year 2016.
“Harvard is fortunate to have a community of alumni and friends who, each year, support our mission of teaching and research,” University spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan wrote in a statement. McKiernan added that donations to the University support financial aid and research funding, among other endeavors.
The particularly successful fundraising year comes as declining revenue streams could “significantly constrain” budgets across the University. The value of Harvard’s endowment sunk by almost $2 billion in fiscal year 2016, and Harvard Management Company expects its returns to be low in the future. Administrators are also concerned that federal funding levels could drop.
According to Ann E. Kaplan, the director of the study, the largest three donations from individuals to Harvard in fiscal year 2016 were $60 million, $50 million gift, and $30 million gifts, but Kaplan said those figures denote payments and not pledged or incremental gifts, like John A. Paulson’s $400 million gift. The Council for Aid to Education only collects data about the top three gift amounts.
Donations from foundations and other organizations to Harvard were up in fiscal year 2016. Kaplan said Harvard received $142 million from foundations and companies last year, $13 million more than it did in 2015.
Alumni donations to Harvard were down from fiscal year 2015, dipping from $650 million to $613 million, Kaplan said. But the numbers are still far higher than two years ago, when the University collected less than two-thirds of that number—$393 million—from alumni.
“They fit the pattern, but you can see where the pattern doesn’t tell the whole story,” Kaplan said.
Harvard received $134 million from individuals other than parents and alumni in 2016, Kaplan said, nearly double the figure from the previous year. Parent donations also increased sharply, from $43 million to $85 million.
Michael T. Kerr ’81, co-chair of the executive committee of the Harvard College Fund, said last month that raising more than $1 billion in a single year remains unusual despite the recent trend.
“It’s been the number during the campaign. When you get through the campaign we’re gonna go down to a lower number,” Kerr said. “You’re supposed to stretch the system during a campaign, and hopefully your loyal alums stretch a little more than they normally would because of some goal that they’re interested in.”
Another alumnus, Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60, said last month that such a benchmark could only be reached if Harvard can justify the donations.
“Harvard has to make the case with its constituencies that what it can do with these contributions justifies the very large size,” Buttenwieser said. “So that’s going to determine if a billion dollars is the new normal or not: if Harvard can make the case that it can use a billion dollars a year wisely.”
Harvard’s capital campaign will end in June 2018. Remaining fundraising priorities include bolstering financial aid, funding a house renewal project, and constructing a new campus in Allston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours after Betsy DeVos was confirmed as the United States Secretary of Education Tuesday, some Harvard student activists concerned about how she will enforce the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX started plotting a response.
DeVos, who has little background in public education, earned the Senate’s confirmation in a close 51-50 vote after Vice President Michael Pence cast the tie-breaking vote Tuesday.
Anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better is preparing a public statement that outlines their “dismay” at DeVos’s confirmation and reaffirms the group’s commitment to supporting victims of sexual assault at Harvard, according to organizer Jessica R. Fournier ’17.
Since President Donald Trump nominated DeVos for the position in November, Democrats and Republicans alike have raised concerns about her qualifications for the job. DeVos, a billionaire, has donated thousands of dollars to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy organization seeking to make it more difficult to punish college students accused of sexual assault.
During her Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 17, DeVos suggested that federal enforcement of Title IX—especially as it relates to sexual assault on college campuses—would likely shift under her guidance. She did not say whether she would continue former President Barack Obama’s approach to the legislation.
Under Obama, the federal government expanded its oversight of how universities respond to cases of sexual assault on campus. In particular, the Department of Education called on colleges to adopt a “preponderance of the evidence” standard for sexual assault investigations, among other stipulations. At the department’s urging, the University adopted the proposed standard in 2014.
“Obviously this is really disappointing news,” Fournier said. “Now more than ever, we want to emphasize we are still here, we’re not giving up, we’re not going away, and we’re going to continue fighting for the rights of survivors of sexual assault on campus.”
“DeVos is hugely concerning for many reasons,”she added. “One of those reasons is because she really has no interest in upholding Title IX protections for survivors.”
Fournier said she fears DeVos’s confirmation will lead to less federal enforcement of Title IX, meaning fewer investigations will be opened in sexual violence cases and victims of sexual assault will be less likely to earn redress.
“Given who she is, who Trump is, this is something we can expect to see,” Fournier said.
In an interview last week prior to DeVos’s confirmation, Harvard Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell vowed that any “relaxation in requirements” from the White House would not affect the University’s commitment to addressing issues of sexual assault on campus.
“In the unlikely event that new requirements come down, we’ll obviously comply with those requirements,” she said. “[But] it doesn’t really matter what’s happening in Washington in terms of the level of attention we’re going to provide to this.”
Bill D. McCants, Harvard’s Acting Title IX Officer, agreed with Newell and said he does not believe DeVos’s confirmation will affect the University’s stance on Title IX.
“This is my 15th year of doing civil rights investigations, including Title IX, and the wind has shifted over those 15 years in various directions and I don’t believe that the core mission of assuring equal access to the University’s programs and activities has wavered in that time,” McCants said.
“So that’s the reason why I’m confident this will not mean a course change for Harvard at all,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, Harvard wrestling must wait six months between the first day of school and the start of postseason competition. Now the Crimson must wait a mere four weeks.
At the start of March, Harvard (2-7, 1-3 Ivy) will travel to Lewisburg, Pa. for the EIWA Championships. Two weeks later, any successful wrestlers will trek to St. Louis, Mo. for the NCAA Championships.
The rest of the year is really a preliminary for these end-of-season competitions. In 2016, then-sophomore Josef Johnson joined then-seniors Devon Gobbo and Todd Preston at the NCAA Championships.
On this year’s team, Johnson has the best shot of booking a ticket to St. Louis. There is still, however, the matter of finishing out the regular season.
“We are such a talented team,” captain Jeffrey Ott said. “There’s no doubt in my mind that we can send a lot of guys to the NCAA tournament. What we’re trying to improve upon is just the belief in matches against highly ranked guys.”
On Saturday, the Crimson took another step toward that goal—albeit a shaky and largely forgettable step. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the team dropped two matches to Princeton and Penn, with no Harvard contestant going 2-0.
PRINCETON 33, HARVARD 3
When the referee’s whistle pierced the air, the junior Johnson stood up to exult. And for good reason.
Facing Jonathan Schleifer, the No. 17 college wrestler at 174 lbs., Johnson had hung tough early in the match. Then he had seized control for a 3-1 sudden triumph.
“Joe Johnson has been a rock,” Ott said. “He’s putting matches together, match after match. He’s very consistent.”
Any celebration was short-lived, however. Johnson’s upset win provided the only points on an evening when the Tigers (7-6, 3-0) nearly shut out the Crimson. Ultimately, Princeton sent the visitors packing by a score of 33-3.
Not counting Johnson, all but three wrestlers suffered defeats by decision. Freshman Connor Sakmar lost by technical fall, freshman Zeth Dean lost by fall, and sophomore Peter Bears lost by major decision.
Even so, several matches came down to the wire. At 197 lbs., Junior Logan Kirby dropped a 5-4 heartbreaker. Similarly, freshman A.J. Jaffe and senior Nicholas Gajdzik were on the wrong ends of 6-5 and 1-0 squeakers, respectively.
Rounding out the lineup were sophomore Samuel Goldman, freshman Hunter Ladnier, and junior Kanon Dean. Of this trio, Dean lost by the smallest margin—a 3-0 decision.
“Maybe in a couple individual matches this weekend, we were a little out-classed,” Ott said. “But the main thing you judge those matches on is just effort.”
PENN 27, HARVARD 17
The drive from Cambridge to Philadelphia winds past oil refineries, tollbooths, and roadside Subways. The six-hour journey feels like it takes six hours.
This past weekend, though, a glimmer of hope brightened the road. On Jan. 28, Harvard had lost to Cornell, 33-11—an expected result that nonetheless stood out because of three individual victories.
The dual contest at Penn offered a chance to leverage any momentum. Sitting at 1-4 in the EIVA, the Quakers seemed vulnerable for a defeat.
That defeat never came. Harvard took a 6-0 lead after Ladnier pinned his opponent, but five straight wins by Penn (4-6, 1-2) swung the match beyond the Crimson’s control.
Although Goldman claimed a 16-1 win by technical fall and Gajdzik took a 6-1 decision, Harvard never climbed back. Final score: Quakers 27, Crimson 17.
The prolonged losing streak started with the freshman Dean, who lost by fall. Next came Bearse, Johnson, and Dean, who combined for three pints. Kirby, who also lost by fall, rounded out the tough stretch.
Gajdzik, Goldman, and Jaffe—who claimed a 10-3 decision—kept the score close in later matches. But a major-decision lost by Sakmar put the result out of reach.
“We’re looking to improve,” Ott said. “We do a good job keeping things in perspective and knowing that what you judge a successful or an unsuccessful season by is really in the postseason.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second consecutive year, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team found itself paired up with crosstown rivals Boston University in the Women’s Beanpot Consolation game, with both teams looking to avoid finishing as the bottom team in Beantown.
In a back and forth affair in which the two teams combined for a total of 12 goals over the span of 60 minutes and neither led by more than one at any point, the Crimson (3-17-5, 3-11-4 ECAC) and Terriers (13-10-6, 8-8-4 WHEA) settled for a 6-6 tie after both team were unable to break through in the deciding overtime period.
“That was more like a lacrosse game than a hockey game.” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I loved how our kids continued to compete the entire game...I’m very proud of our effort. There’s not doubt this group of kids brings its best effort every time they put the jersey on.”
After combining for six goals in the span of the first 40 minutes of the game, a frantic third period saw the back and forth story continue as the teams once again put up six goals, this time in the span of a mere 20 minutes.
BU winger Rebecca Leslie scored just over five minutes into the final period of regulation to give her team a 4-3 only to see Harvard co-captain Sydney Daniels equalize almost immediately with a rocket from the point past Terrier netminder Erin O’Neil.
Former Harvard forward Mary Parker–who graduated last year for the Crimson with a year of eligibility remaining and opted to play for BU–recovered the lead for her new team as the fifth-year sent a laser from just inside the right faceoff circle past Harvard rookie goalkeeper Larcom for a 5-4 lead.
Harvard was up to the challenge once again, however, as junior forward Lexie Laing evened the score with a shot from the just outside the crease. Parker looked to have given her team the deciding lead, however, as a shot from teammate teammate Victoria Bach rebounded off Larcom to a waiting Parker for the 6-5 lead.
With time running out and just over a minute remaining in regulation, sophomore winger Kate Hallett scored a dramatic equalizer for the Crimson, poking in the puck from just outside the crease following a scrum in front of the Terrier net to rescue a tie for her team.
“Coach says we need to play a full 60 minutes and our team has done that continuously throughout the year” Hallett said. “We’re kids with a lot of heart, a lot of work ethic and we’re going to keep pushing no matter what.”
BU opened up the scoring in the first period as a shot by Terrier forward Maddie Elia set off a scrum in front Larcom. The puck floated around the crease before senior winger Nina Rodgers poked it home for BU to give her team the early lead.
It took less than five minutes for Harvard to respond, taking advantage of a powerplay opportunity to even the score as Terrier defender Connor Galway was called for an interference penalty.
It only took a few moments for the Crimson to find the back of the net as Harvard worked the puck up towards the goalline before Laing swung the puck across the crease for classmate Haley Mullins to tap in for a 1-1 scoreline.
BU regained control of the match at the beginning of the second stanza with Rodgers returning the favor to Elia, as the former sent a rocket towards the net that was redirected by Elia past a stranded Larcom.
Once again, however, it was Mullins who responded in less than five minutes for Harvard as the junior intercepted the puck in the Crimson’s offensive zone. After the puck managed to bounce around between a few sticks, Daniels fed Mullins who controlled the puck in the slot and sent flying past O’Neil.
After struggling to bounce back from deficits throughout the season, Stone credited her players for refusing to deflate and remaining aggressive despite falling behind throughout the game.
“I think our kids are fed up quite frankly.” Stone said. “They’re tired of being in that position and they’re proud, really proud kids. They want to be better than we are right now and our record doesn’t show our fight or tenacity that our team has.”
Though Harvard ramped up its aggressiveness on the attack after Mullins’ second goal, the Crimson found itself up in the most unexpected of ways.
A routine clearance by Harvard junior defender Chelsea Ziadie from the defensive zone sent the puck calmly towards O’Neil, who looked to immediately push the puck forward in order to keep the Crimson pinned back. The Terrier netminder, however, allowed the puck to bounce off her stick and between her legs, allowing it to trickle into the goal as she looked around in confusion.
Ziadie was given credit for the goal, her second tally in as many consecutive games, while Larcom was credited with the helper.
“I think Erin saw the couple of BU kids kind of fanning out and late in the process she made the decision ‘oh I can move this up quick’, forgetting she was in the middle of the net.” BU coach Brian Durocher said.
While the Crimson looked to be in control, a lapse on the defensive third allowed BU forward Victoria Bach to control the puck behind the net and skate unguarded around Larcom’s gloveside before sending a rocket into the top shelf to make it 3-3 and set up an eventful final 25 minutes of play.
With the tie now in its rearview mirror, Harvard looks to build on this result as the team makes a push to make the ECAC Playoffs, starting with a pair of road games at Union and RPI this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no place like home for the Harvard women’s tennis team. Playing its first matches of 2017 at the Murr Center, the squad picked up its first three victories of the season, stymieing Boston College, Georgetown, and Rhode Island over the weekend. Captain June Lee, junior Annika Ringblom, and freshman Irene Lu all won three singles matches over the two days. For her performance, Lee is The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week.
“We’re really proud of June and the way she’s been competing for us,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “She’s really grown tremendously as a student and a leader on our team. Her fitness is impeccable, she’s been working a lot on that and her leadership was amazing this weekend. Without her leadership, we wouldn’t be in the same place. The biggest part of her game is her energy.”
Lee, the only senior on a team that features seven freshmen and just one other upperclassman,  won all of her singles matches in straight sets, starting the Crimson (3-4) off on the right foot on Sunday against Rhode Island and clinching Saturday’s win over BC.
HARVARD 4, RHODE ISLAND 0
Harvard captured the doubles point in dominating fashion and never looked back, making quick work of the Rams (4-4) on Sunday afternoon. The freshman duo of Natasha Gonzalez and Irene Lu conceded just one game to their visitors from Kingston. Lee and sophomore Sabrina Xiong one-upped their first-year teammates, winning all six games against Rhode Island.
“It’s pretty tough to play three matches in one weekend, especially two matches in one day early on in the season to really test your fitness and focus,” Green said. “We definitely got a lot tougher from the overall experience and we’re looking to carry that momentum from those wins.”
With the doubles point in hand, Lee, Lu, and freshman Angelina Ye all secured two-set victories to end the match with the minimum number of completed games. Lee made the most of her first appearance of the weekend at the top singles spot, winning all 12 games against freshman and Norristown, Pa. native Mihaela Codreanu.
HARVARD 4, GEORGETOWN 3
The Crimson’s closest match of the weekend came on Sunday morning. Harvard found itself down early after the Hoyas (1-1) secured the doubles point to begin the match. Sophomore Erica Oosterhout and Lee fell to Georgetown’s Victoria Saperstein and Risa Nakagawa to give Lee her only loss of the weekend in six matches. However, the senior proved to be the catalyst for the Crimson when the match switched to singles action.
“Individually, I thought it was a pretty solid weekend,” Lee said. “There’s still definitely more work to do in doubles, individually and as a team.”
Lee beat Nakagawa in the No. 2 position and teammates Ringblom, Lu, and Oosterhout all posted similar results to give Harvard a come-from-behind victory.
“When you’re playing your singles match, you want to make sure you’re being positive and pumping up your teammates, keeping your composure,” Lee said. “When your teammates playing next to you are looking around, they tend to see what your attitude and morale is and feed off that.”
HARVARD 5, BOSTON COLLEGE 2
The Crimson began the weekend against an Eagles team that has given it fits over the past few seasons. After losing the doubles point, it looked as though history was about to repeat itself in Cambridge.
However, Harvard’s fourth, fifth, and sixth players made sure to not let that happen. The trio of Ringblom, Lu, and Gonzalez all picked up straight set victories in their respective matches to give Harvard some much-needed momentum.
Oosterhout and Lee picked up signature wins from the top two positions to seal the win for the Crimson. Oosterhout upset Asiya Dair, the No. 104 player in the nation, in a thrilling 6-4, 2-6, 12-10 affair while Lee was victorious over Lexi Borr in straight sets.
“This weekend was a great opportunity for our team to play some tough opponents and really test our mental strength and also our fitness,” Green said. “I’m really proud of the way our gang came together under different circumstances for different matches and pulled out the win.”

Hello, Harvard. Did you miss us? It’s the too-cool-for-school duo Betty and Hyemi, providing Harvard’s student body with the all the advice you so *desperately* need from us. Sorry for the huge delay. For those of you who’ve submitted questions to us, thank you! And for the rest of you shedding tears onto your keyboard right now because you didn’t have the chance to do so, not to worry! You can anonymously submit them right here. We’ll be here every two weeks to  and we’re a biweekly column so we’ll be back.
Favorite bad story about yourself?
Betty: True Life: I had an emergency wisdom tooth extraction in South Africa this summer. So here’s the story in all of its gruesome detail: I was in South Africa for two months this summer and, a couple of weeks into the summer abroad program, I went on a little weekend getaway wine tour with two friends (let’s call them Amanda and Sophia for the purposes of this story). We get absolutely “obligerated” (obliterated + belligerent, seek urban dictionary for reference). I’m talking some sort of wine drunk I never knew existed. I did not sleep that night. Not only did I still have the worst hangover of my young life, but our cabin was refrigerator temperature and the left side of my mouth was in more pain than I knew existed. Fast forward three days. A random dentist I found on the interweb examines my infected tooth/gum area. “Your pain will only get worse if you don’t get this wisdom tooth removed as soon as possible.” Next thing I know, my mouth is very minimally numbed up and this dude is tearing at my gums with something all-too-resemblant of an x-acto blade. His assistant holds my hand and whispers in my ear words of a language I don’t entirely understand. Tears stream down my cheeks uncontrollably for two hours, until my tooth is finally extracted. I walk back to my guest house, still alive to tell the tale.
Hyemi: One year during Harvard-Yale weekend, I locked myself out of my room after taking a shower so I had to walk to the security desk of Dunster from my fourth floor room in my electric blue towel and my fuzzy bunny slippers. Luckily, a lot of people had already left for Yale so the house was relatively empty, but that also meant all of my roommates were gone too. The security guard on-duty asked for my name and said this was the funniest sight he had ever seen. This event really made me reconsider my relationship with my bunny slippers.
Why does Harvard dating suck?
Hyemi: Agreed! The only time I ever go on dates are when I email my Datamatches to go on a “Zinnekens date” with me to write about it for Flyby (very pitiable, I know). In my ~expert opinion~ I wonder if it’s simply because we don’t want to take risks and place ourselves in a position of emotional vulnerability, but brush it off as “not wanting a relationship” or “being too busy for one.” So maybe we all owe it to ourselves and to those we like to be more honest about our feelings! I’m not excluding myself from this either. Sometimes, I don’t want to say hi to the cute guy in lecture even though it’s literally just a normal human greeting because I’m scared that the way I say “hi” or how I wave my hand will somehow reveal my crush on him and then I’ll be too embarrassed to ever come to lecture again and then I’ll fall behind in the class because of poor attendance and then I’ll fail said class.
Betty: Why is the Pope Catholic? Why was Harambe shot? There are some questions even I, with all of my wisdom, cannot answer.
Cool date ideas?
Hyemi: I personally think a cool date would involve art and beer! It would be fun to go on a late afternoon date to a museum and stay until closing time (which is often around 5 or 6 p.m. on weekdays and that’s ideal because you don’t awkwardly have to wonder when it’s socially appropriate to say you’ve seen enough), and then go for beer afterwards so you can chat and get to know each other in a more casual setting instead of feeling nervous about something long and formal like dinner.
P.S. This set-up is also perfect if you’re like me and tell your friends (or the entire campus) about every little detail in your life because then you can save dinner for late-night take-out with your roommates and debrief for DAYS about your date in the comfort of your PJs and pad thai.
Betty: Take me on a date to a Pats game and 9/10 I would marry you. For real though, I’ve spent quite a lot of time not going on dates (re: last Listen Up!) and therefore a lot of time imagining the coolest dates I could/should be going on. Sky Zone is a top-contender. What’s better than jumping around in matching orange socks? On second thought, I’d probably have like three asthma attacks after jumping for 10 minutes, and I can only imagine how devastating I’d look in all of my breathless, sweaty glory. So for now, I’ll probably stick to food and a movie (or Pats game) as the go-to date ideas. What’s better than some McDonald’s and ‘Flix?
What’s your favorite cocktail?
Hyemi: Quite honestly, I’m not an expert with alcohol so I always go for anything on the menu that has ~elderflower liqueur~ in it because doesn’t it just sound nice and fancy?
Betty: I’m not much of a cocktail kinda gal– I prefer the finer things, read: Spiked Seltzers. Must I choose a cocktail, however, I’d probably go with sex on the beach, mostly because I don’t not think it’s the funniest thing ever to ask my waiters for sex on the beach.
