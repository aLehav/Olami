After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over two weeks ago, a group of protesters interrupted a Bank of America recruitment event at the Charles Hotel. The protest ended quickly—Bank of America had wisely placed plainclothes police officers in the back of the event—but not before the protesters succeeded in disrupting the presentation. The protest was misdirected, inappropriate, and disrespectful to students.
The protesters followed up with hyperbole. A letter explaining the protest said students “might as well accept a job digging [their] own graves” as long as Bank of America invests in coal. They claimed that Bank of America’s job offers “make a mockery of our generation.” To the contrary, the protesters made a mockery of the intelligence of the attendees. They chose to interrupt something as innocuous as an information session instead of respecting students’ ability to make reasoned decisions—without theatrics. Their choice to disrupt rather than engage, to block a conversation about students’ futures rather than present constructive alternatives, is shameful.
The clear passion of the demonstrators could have been communicated respectfully. They can and should hold their own events, run their own ads, and even protest. In this case, the protesters failed to choose an appropriate time or place for directing their disgruntlement. They chose to target their peers rather than decision makers.
The protesters’ points about the harms of climate change are not entirely without merit, but ill-considered protests such as this one are counterproductive. Disrupting the event garnered some press attention and perhaps even sparked conversations, but the tactics of debate-by-tantrum hurt the underlying cause. The nature of the protest encourages the leaders of Bank of America to dismiss the protesters’ grievances. The students in the audience who were disrupted probably have a dim view of the protesters as well. Those who take time to read the protester’s letter are probably struck not by the important warnings about climate change but by the lack of reasonable solutions. The authors ignore, for example, what Bank of America’s shareholders might say about divesting from coal. Protesting is a legitimate tactic for change, but this protest was disruptive with no redeeming value.
Perhaps the protesters did not articulate practical solutions in a respectful manner because they have no solutions to offer. They present only a black-and-white vision of the world, where any coal investment whatsoever means that Bank of America is a bad company. A lot needs to change in a world threatened by climate change, but the protesters should start with the realistic rather than the fanciful. Students should choose discussion over disruption.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the beginning of logic class and my professor asks us a riddle: You visit an island where each person is either a knight, who always tells the truth, or a knave, who always lies. You find two islanders, Alfred and Clara, and Clara says, “If I’m a knight, then Alfred is too.” What are they? While the answer (they’re both knights) is not immediately clear to me, one thing is: When I end up getting a job, I’ll probably never need to know how to do these types of riddles. Is there a reason I should care about Clara?
It’s a common complaint. The kid who hates math wonders why he should study limits if he’ll never use them again in his life. The aspiring biologist wonders why he should waste his time understanding how Puritan culture influenced the development of New England. The aspiring historian wonders why he should waste his time learning the function of phosphofructokinase.
And it’s a complaint that relates closely to the recent decline in the humanities. In the wake of technological breakthroughs and high demand for STEM graduates, many study what will be most applicable to their future profession. Some accept this trend as a matter of prudence; in a hyper competitive, post-financial crisis job market, people look for majors that will get them appealing salaries. Others want to reverse this trend, arguing that humanities courses hone a capacity for critical thinking that can be transplanted into any profession, and moreover that people should major in what interests them rather than what puts a Maserati in the driveway.
I fall somewhere in the middle. While I’d urge people to reflect about whether money ought to be the primary pursuit in life, there are plenty of legitimate reasons to pursue a job for its income—the desire to financially support aging parents or children, for example. And given the success of many trade schools and the high demand for MIT graduates, it’s too idealistic to argue that general capacities like creativity, analytical reasoning, and critical thinking can substitute for the core technical skills developed in a STEM major, at least when it comes to post-graduate recruitment. Supplement, sure, but not replace.
That said, I fear that these students who switch to more financially practical majors are pulling the academic pendulum too far toward the technical side. It seems reasonable to fill one’s schedule with even more practical classes if one is pursuing a practical major. The physics major takes another physics course rather than a poetry class; the social studies concentrator opts out of quantum mechanics. But it’s a line of reasoning I don’t think is valid, because it reveals a diminished appreciation of the value of a liberal arts education.
Now, why should the English major take a multivariate calculus class? Simply because it would activate a part of his brain that would otherwise lie fallow. A great triumph of neuroscience is the discovery that our brains rewire according to our experience, that our neural connections are strengthened if innervated or lost if unused. My professor put this rather cynically by describing education as the process of shutting doors; as we spend more time learning certain subjects and ignoring others, we lose many neural connections, becoming locked in a narrow scope and unable to think thoughts we once could.
Taking classes from various disciplines activates different parts of our brains, counteracting this process of dispositional entrapment. Maintaining neural connections relevant to many different subjects gives us a greater capacity to synthesize and analogize information from different fields, paving the way for interdisciplinary and innovative problem solving. We shouldn’t solely focus on the depth-building classes found in a major and ignore the breadth of a general education, since breadth leads to depth—the general capacities created by studying various fields will enhance our ability to excel in any given one.
Taking diverse courses also makes us better world citizens, and frankly, more human. A consensus of world’s major scientific organizations supports adding GMOs to our diets and the majority of economists believe that rent ceilings reduce the quality and quantity of housing. These are issues for which intuitive aversion disappears with adequate knowledge. When we familiarize ourselves with the vernacular and style of thought of different subjects, we lower both opposition to progressive change found in irrational ignorance and vulnerability to pseudo-logical appeals to emotion often found in rhetoric. And we become more well-rounded people, not the products of an education machine that churns out social cogs who each do one thing efficiently.
So here’s my advice: Take a useless class. Pick one of our more than 3,500 courses. Enroll pass/fail if you have to. If you’re an economics major, try satisfying the United States in the World requirement with something other than Ec 10. We work out different muscles when we go to the gym. So too should we practice different mental exercises in the library, so we can maintain balance between our technical and general capacities.
Take a useless course, and you’ll find that it isn’t as useless as you thought—that it’s more practical to your critical thinking than many of your major’s requirements. But don’t take my word for it. Clara said so.

Some years ago, the Lord said, “Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.”
And with that, He laid the groundwork for one of Harvard’s most contentious requirements: learning a foreign language.
The language requirement has caused much debate over the school’s history, eventually coming to rest in its current form—two semesters of study with exemptions contingent on incoming test scores or bilingual backgrounds. While wise in principle, this requirement lacks purposed direction. We should rid ourselves of it and incorporate language into the General Education curriculum.
The language requirement dates to 1655, when President Charles Chauncy mandated that all students take a three-year program of Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, and Syriac. With a liberalizing trend in higher education and waning emphasis on the classical tongues, the requirement first evolved into a two-year program and then, after a 1968 faculty vote, into its existing form of one year.
No one doubts that learning a new language has substantial upsides. At its best it provides one with a new perspective, broadens one’s worldview, exposes one to new people, and gives one a fresh way of thinking. There are also numerous benefits of speaking more than English in these globalized times. Only 18 percent of Americans speak a second language as opposed to 53 percent of Europeans.
But what does requiring a year of study accomplish?
When the language requirement was shortened to a year in 1968, Professor Clifford C. Lamberg-Karlovsky commented, “I don't see that a one-year language exposure rule has any educational value. Even abolishing the requirement completely would have been better than this.” I disagree. One year of learning a new language has value. But if the rationale behind the requirement is to guarantee student proficiency, Harvard is falling short of its goal.
Two semesters is simply not enough exposure to a new language to ensure proficiency, especially for those starting at the beginner level. Many students will forget most—if not all—of a new language soon after completing the requirement if their experience is limited to two terms. As most students also know, receiving a passing grade on an SAT Subject Test or AP language test—which allows students to bypass the requirement—also does not prove proficiency.
Many students therefore take foreign language courses just to fill the requirement, failing to become proficient. Especially in the first two years when deciding a concentration, two semesters is a sizeable commitment to something for which you lack passion.
A better approach to language would be more truthful in its ambition; that is, exposure to language has academic value, just as chemistry, psychology, classics, and other traditional disciplines have. To be an educated citizen requires some language experience. This follows the same logic as the General Education requirements: Not everyone needs to be a math concentrator, but any educated person needs a rudimentary understanding of Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning.
A ninth Gen Ed, simply named Language, could include not only foreign language classes, but also linguistics, language-related anthropology, language philosophy and other courses. This would give even students with a strong aversion to learning syntax and semantics the opportunity to explore the complexities and benefits that language as a broader discipline has to offer. Those with a proclivity toward learning a foreign language in full could continue onward in hopes of fluency; others could choose a different path of study after the semester experience.
Just as with other Gen Eds, no one would be exempt from the requirement. Why? College-age language acquisition is a unique cognitive process—almost totally different from acquisition in the pre-puberty years. Processing involves different regions of the brain and neural pathways. And unlike the current requirement, the goal of this new Gen Ed would not be fluency. Instead, students would aim to increase the breadth of their mental and academic capacities.
We need to continue to learn language here at Harvard. The current requirement, however, lacks direction and coherent logic. Adapting language into a Gen Ed would give a more honest articulation of the academic goal. It would make things simpler—everyone needs to take language regardless of background. It would also be more palatable for those with strong foreign-language aversions.
Put simply, a shift from the current system to Gen Ed makes sense in any language.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, New Jersey became just the third state to allow online gambling, after Nevada and Delaware opened up the untapped market earlier this year. Those who are physically in New Jersey can now play all the games offered in Atlantic City without getting off the couch. Within a week, 37,277 signed up for gambling websites, putting HeathCare.Gov to shame.
In a country that worships individual freedom and the glamour of Las Vegas, the legal hurdle for online gambling seems easy to cross. However, online gambling has been a murky legal area since its conception in the late nineties. In 2006, after years of failed attempts to regulate online gambling, four Republican senators sneaked the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act as an amendment into a totally unrelated law on maritime security, and got it passed on the last day of Congress without a debate. Quietly and swiftly, Congress made this blossoming industry illegal.
After the act was signed, online gambling websites moved underground. The underground nature of online gambling means that those who placed bets with these websites were not protected from fraud. Full Tilt, a prominent online poker site, was accused of fraud, and its owner pled guilty to operating what prosecutors characterized as a Ponzi scheme in 2011. Nonetheless, an estimated 1,700 offshore websites continued to accept bets totaling $4 billion per annum.
The popularity of underground online gambling speaks volumes for consumers’ preferences. Gamblers who want to play casual games without visiting a casino have an option at their fingertips. Unlike casinos, online gambling is also cheaper, as the operators can cut the costs of operating a brick-and-mortar casino and paying skilled dealers. The barrier to entry for online gambling websites is relatively low, so websites will compete more freely for customers with deals and comps. Like Amazon’s displacement of retail stores and Netflix’s displacement of Blockbuster, online gambling has allowed us to gamble more efficiently and conveniently, and consumers have reaped this benefit.
Given that online gambling will be popular among consumers anyway, it may make sense to regulate, rather than ban, online gambling. Regulated online gambling will generate much-needed revenue through gambling taxes. Online gambling in New Jersey is subject to a hefty 15 percent tax on revenue, which is projected to generate $45 million for the state government. Legalization will also make online gambling safer, as regulators can protect gamblers from outright fraud and business practices that prey on gambling addiction.
So why was online gambling banned in the first place? I believe the ban was motivated by the lingering cultural stigma of gambling. Gambling was associated with the decadent lifestyle of gangsters and hustlers. For a few decades, it was only legally and socially acceptable to gamble in Nevada, the first state to legalize gambling. Gambling laws have loosened, but attitudes toward gambling have not. In a sense, gambling is analogous to heavy drinking—okay in a specific time and place, but not okay on a daily basis at home. Given this stigma, opponents of the law can easily conjure up an image of online gamblers as men who have lost control of vice in their private lives.
But there is no reason to think that gambling problems develop more easily online. First, since the cost of operating online gambling is lower, the bet size in online games can be as low as one cent rather than ten dollars, which is common in casinos. It is a lot harder to lose a large sum of money playing online. Perhaps more importantly, casinos offer much more than betting—and this turns people into problem gamblers. Last week, when I tried my luck at The Venetian in Las Vegas, I realized that it was not just the thrill of winning that pinned me to the table games. Casinos created a multitude of sensory stimuli with the clanking sounds of slot machines, the cheering crowds at table games, and the scantily dressed, way-out-of-my-league bartenders who serve free alcohol. The glamour and allure that makes casinos so successful can also disorient the gambler, in ways that betting in front of a laptop cannot.
Given that legal online gambling offers a cheaper, more convenient, and safer alternative to casino gambling, it is no wonder that one of the most vocal opponents of legalizing online gambling is Sheldon Adelson, the multibillionaire owner of Las Vegas Sands Corporation. Despite Adelson’s repeated claim that “money is not the consideration with me,” I am optimistic that online gambling will be competitive with traditional casinos and will be favored by many consumers. It will be up to state legislators around the country to open this new market to consumers.
Game on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study published in connection with the Harvard Kennedy School earlier this month found that university students and government nurses in Bangalore, India who cheated on a simple task were more likely to want government jobs.
The study was conducted by economists Rema N. Hanna, an associate professor at the Kennedy School, and Shing-Yi Wang, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. The paper is affiliated with the Center for International Development at the University.
The students who participated in the study were chosen randomly, while the nurses worked for the government and were selected based on their participation in a previous study on their absences from work.
During the study, the participants were asked to roll a standard die 42 times and self-report their own score. The researchers determined the prevalence of lying by comparing the participants’ answers with the median score for dice points.
According to the study, nurses who were above the sample median of dice points were 7.1 percent more likely to be fraudulently absent than those below it. In addition, students who cheated on the dice game were then 6.3 percent more likely to want a government job.
The study concludes that a relationship exists between students lying on the dice test and their desire to go into public service and nurses lying on the dice test and their dishonesty about their reasons for missing work.
Though the study may have some implications for those who wish to enter public service in certain countries, Wang said in an email to The Crimson that the results do not necessarily apply outside India. She added that her motivation for the study was based on what she has seen in developing countries, though similar tests outside of India would make for interesting follow-up research.
Similarly, Jane J. Mansbridge, a professor at the Kennedy School who studies political leadership, said in an email to The Crimson that study does not hold much weight outside of “situations where there were good opportunities for corruption.”
Though Mansbridge is not affiliated with the researchers’ work, she had read the study and said that the findings are not necessarily applicable in places like the United States, where there is not much opportunity for corruption at the state or federal level of government.

A Harvard study has found that consuming nuts on a regular basis can reduce a person’s risk of dying from heart disease and cancer.
The study was published on Nov. 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine and was conducted by researchers from the Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
According to lead researcher Ying Bao, a Brigham epidemiologist, previous studies have not examined the relationship between cancer and nut consumption. Yao said her study fills a gap in previous knowledge and is the first to not only link nut consumption with a lower risk of cancer, but also to look at the effect of peanuts, which are technically legumes, on mortality.
“We were particularly interested in the relationship between nut consumption and many specific causes of mortality, like heart disease, cancer, infection, and diabetes,” Bao said. “Previous studies have often only looked at one cause in particular, which usually is heart disease.”
The data, gathered over thirty years of extensive research and experiments, is based on a participant pool of around 118,000 healthy volunteers.
Volunteers who consistently consumed a one-ounce daily serving of nuts for seven days a week were 25 percent less likely to die from heart disease, 20 percent less likely to die from lung disease and diabetes, and 10 percent less likely to die from cancer. Subjects consumed a variety of nuts, including both peanuts and “tree nuts,” such as walnuts, cashews, and almonds.
Bao said the results did not surprise her and her fellow researchers, as previous studies indicated similar health benefits of nut consumption in daily diet regimens. In an announcement in July 2003, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said that scientific evidence suggests that eating 1.5 ounces per day of most nuts may reduce the risk of heart disease.
Funding for the study came from two National Institutes of Health grants and a grant of $150,000 from the International Tree Nut Council, though some claimed that the funding went against the Council’s mission. In an interview with The Crimson, the executive director of the Tree Nut Council Maureen Ternus said that the organization’s goal is to take the results of the study and use them to encourage health professionals and patients to talk about the benefits of eating nuts.
“We’re not going to fund research for cars. Who do they think is going to fund this research?” Ternus said. “The findings are the findings, and we don’t have any input with that.”
Though the research found a relationship between nut consumption and mortality from certain diseases, Bao said it is actually unclear why exactly nuts are beneficial. The researchers plan to study the association between nuts and a variety of markers for diseases next, according to Bao.
“You cannot expect nuts themselves to solve everything,” Bao said. “That would be unrealistic.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Dec. 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that the study was funded by a $150,000 grant from the International Tree Nut Council. To clarify, that grant only partially funded the study. The rest of the funding came from two National Institutes of Health grants.

Last month, the UK branch of the Personal Genome Project (PGP-UK) went online, following the American project started by genetics professor George Church and colleagues at Harvard Medical School in 2005. 
These projects, in addition to a Canadian project and similar ones slated for South Korea and Germany, seek to establish databases that provide individuals’ genomes alongside their medical histories. These databases are completely accessible from the project websites, both providing unprecedented opportunity for researchers and raising privacy concerns among many.
The PGP-UK is structurally identical to the Harvard-run project. “The key aspects of the [project] started at Harvard have been completely taken aboard,” said Stephan Beck, PGP-UK director and professor of medical genomics at the University College of London Cancer Institute. “I don’t think we differ in any way at all.”     
However, each project is autonomous. “We felt that we should have entirely independent research teams in each country, maybe even more than one per country, because of the laws, customs, and language barriers from region to region,” said Church, director of the Harvard PGP. “The UK project is a pretty big deal in that England tends to be very forward-looking in genetics.” 
Church said that the American team assisted the British team only with experience, computational infrastructure, and the project’s consenting mechanism—a rigorous test that ensures participants’ understanding of the risks of putting their genetic and medical information in the public eye. Each potential participant is prohibited from participation until he or she scores 100% on this test. According to the project website, risks include the use of information to determine paternity, to falsify DNA evidence, and to identify genetic predispositions towards certain diseases. 
The last item has been a particular cause of concern to critics of the project, due to the perennial fear that genetic weaknesses may come to influence individuals’ chances of getting insurance and their rates. This fear is coupled with general concerns about privacy, as corporate data-mining practices and government attention to individuals’ digital information increase. However, Church has argued that privacy cannot be protected against cyberattack anyway, and as a result strongly favors a totally open database with all the data that researchers need. 
Since its establishment, the American project has uploaded 3,141 online participant profiles to date, many of which include the complete medical histories and genomic sequences of individuals. The British project will start with 50 volunteers in its first year and aims to work up to 100,000 individuals with time. Any party can access the information. “It’s like Wikipedia,” Church said.

Emeritus professor and founding director of Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs Robert R. Bowie passed away early last month at the age of 104. A graduate of Harvard Law School, Bowie served as a foreign policy adviser under four separate presidential administrations over the course of his career.
Current executive director of the Weatherhead Center Steven B. Bloomfield credited Bowie with establishing “a sense of community and scholarly purpose” during his time as director. Bloomfield went on to describe the Center as a “strong and capable research center, owing greatly to [Bowie’s] steady guidance for many years.”
Bowie was appointed director of the newly-created center in 1957 after serving for four years as the head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff for then-U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
During his time at the helm of the Weatherhead Center, Bowie presided over a number of distinguished foreign policy staff, including former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and former Dean of the Kennedy School Edward S. Mason. Bowie also developed a program to bring government officials from around the world to study foreign policy at Harvard for a year.
He remained director for fifteen years and continued to teach international policy at Harvard as the Clarence Dillon Professor of International Affairs until retiring in 1980.
Bowie is survived by his two sons, Robert R. Bowie Jr. of Monkton, Maryland and William Chapman of Springfield, Massachusetts, and three grandchildren—Alice, Robert and Peter.
Besides his professional achievements, Bowie is also remembered for his compassion and care for others.
Bowie Jr. described his father as having a “deep moral sense” and a “complete commitment to trying to do the right thing both personally and professionally.”
According to Bowie Jr., when his mother, Mary, developed dementia towards the end of her life and was living in an assisted living facility, his father would visit at least two or three times a week and bring her flowers.
To look after Mary, Bowie would write out 3x5 note cards detailing the minimum caloric intake she needed each day and spend lunch with her, making certain she ate no matter how long it took. Bowie Jr. remembered walking into the dining hall of the assisted living facility and seeing only two people remaining: his mother and father.
When asked what he missed most about his father, Bowie Jr. recalled reading New York Times articles with him during the almost daily visits to his father’s assisted living facility for the last ten years of his life.
Bowie graduated from Princeton University in 1931 before going on to earn his law degree at Harvard in 1934. Upon graduation, Bowie returned to Maryland to practice law as an assistant attorney general before enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1942. Four years later, Bowie returned to his alma mater to teach corporate and antitrust law at HLS.
Besides his teaching appointments, Bowie also served as legal adviser to US High Commissioner for Germany John McCloy from 1950 to 1951, counselor to Secretary of State Dean Rusk from 1966 to 1968, and Chief National Intelligence Officer of the CIA from 1977 to 1979.
In 2009, on his 100th birthday, Bowie was awarded the Commander’s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bowie was recognized for his work towards a united Europe through French and German reconciliation.
During his lifetime, he was also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the American Law Institute and the American Academy of Diplomacy.
 A service for family and friends will be held at Old Wye Church in Wye Mills, Md. on December 7 at 11 am.  The Weatherhead Center also plans to hold a memorial gathering in the spring.

Authors and political journalists Mark E. Halperin ’87 and John A. Heilemann visited the Institute of Politics Monday to discuss the details of their book “Double Down: Game Change 2012” on the recent election.
“The reporting job in this [book] is just truly extraordinary,” said Joe Klein, a political columnist for Time Magazine and moderator of the forum.
Klein asked the panelists a series of questions ranging from the secrets behind their success as writers to the changing role of political journalists.
Halperin, an editor-at-large and senior political analyst for Time Magazine, and Heilemann, national affairs editor of New York Magazine and an MSNBC political analyst, provided an insider’s look at Barack Obama’s election victory over opponent Mitt Romney.
Halperin attributes the success of his writing to what he considers a rare commodity: time.
“We have the greatest luxury that you can have…we have time,” Heilemann said.
He added that, despite journalism becoming increasingly instantaneous and reliant on social media, the authors spent a full year investigating the 2012 election. He said that this time allowed them to conduct deeper analysis than a typical news story.
Heilemann and Halperin suggested that their more than two decades of experience have afforded them unique reporting strategies.
“In asking for interview time, we always have the subject line of the email be, “Do you like piña coladas?” Heilemann commented, elaborating on one of his favorite tactics.
The duo also said that there has been a significant shift in the relationship between journalists and presidents in recent years.
“We have a lot less access than we used to,” Halperin said. “When I first started covering Bill Clinton, when we woke up in the morning, we saw him in the hotel lobby. That kind of access doesn’t happen.”
The event, the last JFK Jr. Forum of the semester, was well-received by audience members. A student in attendance, Sean R. Weller ’17, said that the two “offered intriguing insight into presidential campaigns from a journalistic perspective.”
“You hear so much on the surface... throughout the campaigns about a here and now, how the polling is going,” said Weller. “It’s not until you go forward [that]…you start to see the insights and see what the election is all about.”

UPDATED: December 3, 2013, at 3:12 a.m.
Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, the Undergraduate Council Vice President-Elect, will not resign as previously planned, he said late Monday night, a move that is expected to elevate him to the UC presidency.
With his running-mate, President-Elect Sam B. Clark ’15, still set on resignation, Mayopoulos will assume the top position at the Council’s Dec. 8 inauguration based on the organization’s succession rules.
Clark could not immediately be reached for comment late Monday night. Mayopoulos confirmed that his former running mate still plans to resign.
With Mayopoulos’s reversal, the UC vice president seat will be vacated immediately after the inauguration, forcing the Council to hold an internal vote to elect a new vice president.
Mayopoulos said Monday night that in the days leading up to the election, he and Clark had decided that the “smartest thing” to do was to resign their positions if elected. However, he continued, soon after the election results were released and the duo announced their intent to resign, Mayopoulos began to change his mind.
“We started a conversation by participating in the election and winning the election, but to ensure that change would happen both in terms of how the UC is seen by students and how the UC deals with administrators would actually be to respect the wishes of the voters and serve,” Mayopoulos said. “My goal is to connect with students in a way that the UC hasn’t done before and try to continue using the same kind of energy Sam and I brought to the campaign, into the UC.”
Running on a satirical platform built on promises that more tomato basil ravioli soup be made available for all meals and thicker toilet paper be provided for students, Clark and Mayopoulos won 43 percent of the vote in the UC presidential election, which took place Nov. 18-21. They defeated two tickets composed of current UC members.
Shortly following the announcement of the results the night of Nov. 21, Clark and Mayopoulos released a statement to the UC Election Commission indicating that they would resign as soon as they were able to do so. Several hours later, Raghuveer said that the Council would proceed with plans to inaugurate them at the Dec. 8th meeting and that the UC would move to an internal election if either they stepped down before the inauguration or afterwards—a plan that was affirmed through legislation proposed during Monday night’s UC meeting.
Although Mayopoulos said that he was aware that presiding over the student government is “a massive job” and that “people on the UC are worried that this will make the UC look like a joke,” he said that he is committed to serving. He explained that he thought that it would have been more of a joke if both he and Clark stepped down, disregarding the will of the voters. 
“I am hoping to dispel people’s fears that, ‘Oh, this is just going to be more of a joke,’” Mayopoulos said. “It may be funny, but it won’t be a joke.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After years of frustrating college students into cabs or an early return from nights out in Boston, the MBTA will run all of its subway trains and most popular bus routes until 3 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays beginning next spring, the Boston Globe reported on Monday.
The pilot program will last for at least a year, the Globe reported. Currently, MBTA service ends at 1 a.m., and, Transportation Secretary Richard Davey told the Globe that under the new plan, the last train would leave Boston, on weekends, at around 2:30 a.m.
The program is expected to appeal to the thousands of college and university students who call Boston and its suburbs home, but who have complained about the MBTA’s weekend hours.
“That’s going to change Boston,” Eduardo S. Cabral ’16 said of the plan. “As a student, it will be way easier to enjoy the nightlife in Boston…. I can definitely see myself going into Boston for things on the weekend now.”
The program is also aimed at Boston’s growing technology sector, according to Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78.
“This is about how we make the system modern for the kind of economic growth we have been experiencing and will be experiencing,” Patrick told the Globe. “The folks who work in the innovation sector—they live differently.”
Extending hours for the MBTA’s subways was a popular issue among students and young Bostonians in the city’s recent mayoral race. Patrick told the Globe that the pilot program will be funded using money from corporate partners and other modifications to the state’s budget.
Even though the program is not set to launch until next spring, students are already anticipating the benefits of the change.
"Ever since they shut down the Harvard Square movie theater, you couldn't go to midnight showings because you'd go to Park Street and be stranded there,” said Eric A. Bersin ’14. “I will have to take advantage of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just hours before the Undergraduate Council Vice President-Elect told The Crimson that he no longer plans to step down, the UC met to approve a change to the bylaws designed to prepare for potential vacancies in the President and Vice President-Elect positions.
The new provision came after winning UC ticket Sam B. Clark ’15 and Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 announced plans to resign come the UC’s Dec. 8 presidential inauguration. On Monday night, Mayopoulos said he had changed his mind about resigning, a move that will make him the UC President provided Clark steps down, according to UC rules.
The bylaws previously allowed for an internal UC election to fill the President and Vice President roles if those spots were vacated following the inauguration, but did not specify what would happen if elected candidates resigned any earlier. The new rule, approved Monday night by a 31-4-0 vote, provides for an internal election by the UC if either the President or Vice President-Elect resign prior to the inauguration. 
Despite the change in the Council’s bylaws, current UC president Tara Raghuveer ’14 said that as of Monday night’s meeting, the “UC is operating under the assumption that it has a President and Vice President-elect.”
While some UC representatives voiced concerns that possible internal elections for the top Council positions might generate backlash among students, no members presents voted against the proposed measure. 
“I am not ever in favor of making policy based on anticipated backlash. We know the UC serves a function. If we have to sacrifice how the UC looks for a little while, I’m fine with that,” Raghuveer said.
C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15—who finished second in this year’s UC election, third place candidate Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15, and Oak Yard representative Giora A. Ashkenazi ’17 abstained from voting. 
Prior to voting on the bylaws changes, members shared their thoughts about the new Richard A. & Susan F. Smith Campus Center in a focus group led by representatives from the administrative campus center team and London-based architectural firm Hopkins Architects. 
“It’s fascinating for me to be here tonight and hear what the UC had to think and could invent in the space of one evening,” said Michael Taylor, a senior partner at Hopkins Architects. 
Officially announced earlier in November, the Smith Center will be located on the first three floors of what is currently the Holyoke Center and is expected to begin construction in 2016. 
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said that this meeting was one of many focus groups planned with undergraduate and graduate students for the coming months. The feedback collected in these meetings will inform the design process, he said. 
“The idea is to figure out what we really need on this campus that isn’t already available,” Lassonde said. “We want to emerge from this process with a consensus about what should go in that space.” 
The facilitators broke up audience members—mostly current UC members—into four groups to discuss the pros and cons of the of the building, previously known as the Holyoke Center, and brainstorm potential ways to fill the new student space. 
“Right now I feel that there’s not a space at Harvard that feels unconditionally welcoming to everyone,” said Shawheen J. Rezaei ’17. “I would like the student center to be welcoming and less intimidating.” 
Some of the ideas for the campus center proposed by attendees included a roof garden, a nap room, a 24-hour dining area, and even a ball pit. At the end of the meeting, each attendee voted for the five ideas he or she thought were most important.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May, 26 2017, at 10:50 p.m.
The median grade at Harvard College is an A-, and the most frequently awarded mark is an A, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said on Tuesday afternoon, supporting suspicions that the College employs a softer grading standard than many of its peer institutions.
Harris delivered the information in response to a question from government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 at the monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“A little bird has told me that the most frequently given grade at Harvard College right now is an A-,” Mansfield said during the meeting’s question period. “If this is true or nearly true, it represents a failure on the part of this faculty and its leadership to maintain our academic standards.”
Harris then stood and looked towards FAS Dean Michael D. Smith in hesitation.
“I can answer the question, if you want me to.” Harris said. “The median grade in Harvard College is indeed an A-. The most frequently awarded grade in Harvard College is actually a straight A.”
Harris said after the meeting that the data on grading standards is from fall 2012 and several previous semesters.
In an email to The Crimson after the meeting, Mansfield wrote that he was “not surprised but rather further depressed” by Harris’s answer.
“Nor was I surprised at the embarrassed silence in the whole room and especially at the polished table (as I call it),” Mansfield added, referencing the table at the front of the room where top administrators sit. “The present grading practice is indefensible.”
On the other hand, Classics Department chair Mark J. Schiefsky, who was in attendance at Tuesday’s meeting, said he was surprised by how high the median grade was.
“I don’t know what should be done about it, but it seems to me troubling,” Schiefsky said. “One has a range of grades to give and one would presumably expect a wider distribution.”
Schiefsky said Harris’s comment raised a number of questions about the distribution of grades and that he would appreciate more discussion about the topic.
Classics professor Richard F. Thomas, a member of the Faculty Council who was also in attendance at the monthly meeting, said he expects FAS will discuss grade inflation at some point in the future.
Such a discussion, if initiated, would not be without precedent at Harvard. In 2001, FAS’s Educational Policy Committee labeled grade inflation “a serious problem” at the College after a report in the Boston Globe labeled the College’s grading practices “the laughing stock of the Ivy League.” Despite disagreements on the nature of the problem, the faculty responded in 2002 by moving the College from a 15-point grading system to a more conventional 4.0 scale grading system and capping the number of honors graduate at 60 percent of the class. The Globe had reported that in 2001, 91 percent of Harvard students graduated with honors, and that about half of all awarded grades were in the A-range.
The issue of grade inflation has taken center stage at some of Harvard’s peer institutions as well. In 2004, Princeton substantially restructured its grading system, instructing professors to award grades in the A-range to no more than 35 percent of their students in undergraduate coursework and no more than 55 percent of students in junior and senior year independent study.
The change has been frequently referred to as a policy of “grade deflation,” and since the shift, some have speculated that the tough standards have hurt Princeton’s admissions yield. This fall, Princeton President Christopher Eisgruber announced that the school will review its grading policy.
Yale has initiated its own discussion about grading policies in the last year, forming an ad hoc committee on the subject. In a review last spring, that committee found that 62 percent of grades awarded at Yale College from 2010 to 2012 were in the A-range.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time Harvard played an early-season tournament, junior guard Wesley Saunders was on the bench. In the 2011 Battle for Atlantis, the freshman averaged just over 16 minutes a game, backing up the upperclassman backcourt of Brandyn Curry and Oliver McNally ’12. In three games, Saunders tallied four shots and 13 points.
Two years later at the 2013 Great Alaska Shootout, Saunders reached those milestones in just 22 minutes of play. No longer a role player, the junior has blossomed into, in the words of coach Tommy Amaker, “our best all-around player.”
In the three Crimson wins, Saunders averaged a shade over 14 points, shooting 53 percent from the field and chipping in eight rebounds and 4.7 assists a game. He was later named the tournament’s Most Outstanding Player, joining a group of past winners that includes NBA players Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen.
“He was very deserving of the Most Outstanding Player,” Amaker said. “There is no question that he earned that and did everything for us on both ends of the floor.”
As the team’s leading scorer, Saunders is asked to do a lot on the offensive end—taking over 10 shots and dishing out nearly four assists a game. However, Amaker said, the team has placed a lot of defensive responsibility on him as well. The team’s best perimeter defender, Saunders guards everyone from forwards to point guards.
When the Crimson faced Green Bay in the semifinals, the 6’6” Saunders was matched up against the opposing team’s best offensive player—the 5’11” Kiefer Sykes. The speedy Sykes scored 26 points in the game, but only three in the final eight minutes. During that same span, Saunders added six points, two rebounds, and an assist as the Crimson ended the game on a 22-8 run in a 76-64 victory.
“For Wesley to draw [Sykes] defensively and do the job that he did was phenomenal,” Amaker said. “From an offensive standpoint, he did a fantastic job and I think [Green Bay is] a great defensive team with a dynamic offensive player in Sykes.”
It was not the first time Amaker asked Saunders to defend a speedy point guard. Howard’s James Daniel came into Cambridge on Nov. 15 averaging over 23 points a game, making more than four shots a game from behind the arc. Normally, the task would have been given to Curry, an ace perimeter defender, who was a game-time decision. Minutes before the game, with Curry sidelined with an injury, Saunders was notified that he would guard Daniel.
If Saunders was nervous, it did not show. The junior harassed Daniel into a season-low 14 points. The Howard guard missed 10 of 14 shots from the floor, including all four three point attempts. A game later, Saunders did the same to Bryant’s Dyami Starks—who came in as the nation’s leading scorer at 33.3 points a game. Starks had only 11 points as Saunders forced him into three turnovers, coming up with three steals and two blocks. On the offensive end, Saunders poured in 25 points on just nine shots.
Still, the junior credits the team behind him for his defensive success. Following the win against Bryant, Saunders said he tries in Amaker’s scheme to deny his man the ball and, if that fails, funnel him towards shot-blockers senior Kyle Casey and junior Steve Moundou-Missi. After the Green Bay victory, the junior said he tried to do the same thing against the shifty Sykes.
“[Sykes] is a great player,” Saunders said. “His quickness and ability to get the basket was phenomenal. It was a tough assignment. He is a great player and it was a group effort to defend him. My teammates were helping me out and we did a great job containing him.”
Saunders closed out the weekend by showing another side of his game. In 33 minutes against TCU, he attempted only five shots and finished with a team-high nine assists as the Crimson built a 29-point lead late in the first half and coasted to a 21-point victory.
Amaker said that the team came to the tournament looking to put its name in the rafters alongside major basketball powerhouses and former champions Kentucky, Arizona, and Duke. With the inspired play of Saunders and Moundou-Missi (38 points in three games), the Crimson became the first Ivy League team to win the tournament.
“It’s great to come here to a tournament that has such a great history with so many great players on so many great teams,” Amaker said. “We came this far and didn’t want to come out here without a [championship] win. We were able to do that against a great team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
James Blake ’00 didn’t have a chance to react before it ended.
Down 6-2 in a fifth-set tiebreaker, Blake walked to return the ball as he had thousands of times. Settling into a crouch, Blake stared down his opponent—the 6’10” Ivo Karlovic. Next to the Croat, Blake was a child.
Karlovic tossed the ball, uncoiling his massive frame as he rose to meet the ball eleven feet into the air. Eyes on the ball, Blake split step, ready to move in either direction. He never would.
The ace thundered past Blake at 120 miles an hour. Eyes hidden underneath his black ball cap, Blake lifted a finger to the sky, challenging the call. As he walked to the net, he tapped the line with his racket. The replay confirmed what Blake’s face said: Game over.
A year earlier, it was Blake’s fellow leading American—Andy Roddick—bidding professional tennis farewell. A stone’s throw away in Arthur Ashe, Roddick blinked back tears as he gave his final on-court interview. Blake’s ending had a different feel.
Blake slowly walked to the net, shaking hands with Karlovic and the umpire and packing his bags. His face reflected conflicting emotions—the pain of an end that came too soon and the calm of a man at peace with his journey. Fans rose in applause, whistling and cheering.
One could forgive Blake if he had taken a second to look back. After all, Blake announced himself to the world on the same court that he bid it farewell—Louis Armstrong, the U.S. Open’s second show court. In 2001, a 20-year old Blake, dreadlocks and all, stretched world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt to five sets with the blistering serve and rocket forehand that characterized his biggest wins.
If Louis Armstrong was the sight of Blake’s birth, Arthur Ashe was the sight of his renaissance in 2005. His opponent was French Open champion Rafael Nadal, who had risen to No. 2 in the world on the heels of a 24-match winning streak that included that year’s Canada Masters. By comparison, a year prior, Blake had been lying on a hospital bed with a broken neck, shingles, and his father’s death hanging over him.
No matter. Blake took down the teenage Spaniard in four sets, reaching the quarterfinals. A year later, he reached the same round before falling to Andre Agassi—both results his best ever in a major.
But in 2013, the man who enjoyed the best times of his career on the blue hard courts of Flushing Meadows waved goodbye. He did not look back as he strode off the court—shutting the door on an unusual career in which he took the road less traveled to the top, accomplishing much and leaving with little regret.
THE ROAD FROM HARLEM
There is a sad irony to Blake not ending his career on Arthur Ashe Stadium—the colossal 22,547 seat show court at the U.S. Open. Ashe, who spent a large part of his career training in Harlem, was the first black man to capture the U.S. Open. However, for all the shortsighted comparisons of the two during the latter’s career, Blake had his roots in a different Harlem.
Growing up, Blake was the prodigal son of the Harlem Tennis Center. Blake began coming to the center when he was one year old. In the beginning, he watched his parents play. He was on the court by age four and quickly moved up the junior ranks. By the fourth grade, his family made the move to Fairfield, Conn. to give Blake and his brother Thomas better instruction.
At the nearby Tennis Club of Trumbull, the Blakes bloomed. Harvard coach Dave Fish remembers Blake at 13 being “a little pencil of a kid,” but he quickly developed into one of the top juniors in the nation. In his senior year of high school, Blake made the finals of Kalamazoo, the most prestigious junior tournament in the United States.
“[Tennis] was something our parents were into, so we naturally gravitated towards it,” Thomas said. “He started to get pretty good around fourteen or fifteen…. By the time that he was 18, he was one of the top two players in the country.”
Scholarship offers from the University of North Carolina and the University of Virginia—two of the nation’s premier tennis programs, were on the table. His older brother, who would reach the NCAA Round of 16 later that year, was Fish’s right hand man in pitching Harvard to the younger Blake.
“I [eventually] talked him into it,” Thomas said. “He was thinking about possibly playing for other schools and whether he would be playing as much at Harvard as UNC or UVA. I just gave him my view on what it had been for me there and said I thought he would be able to hack [it].”
In high school, Blake had watched Thomas play at Harvard and had spent time with the team for the last three years. After talking with Fish and his older brother, Blake followed in Thomas’s footsteps, making the jump to Cambridge, and with it, collegiate tennis.
A PART OF A TEAM
Right when Blake got to Harvard, Fish knew that he had a different kind of player on hand.
“Have you ever seen the Batmobile, when [Batman] pushes the button and all of a sudden there is something that nobody expected?” Fish said. “That was James. He had several gears that put him at the head of the pack.... Something would happen, then he would fire out and be a different player. He had more levels to go to than a lot of people do.”
Under Fish’s tutelage, Blake found another gear. The player Fish said had “opened a lot of eyes” before arriving at Cambridge was not physically ready for the ATP Tour as an 18-year old. Collegiate tennis helped him mature mentally and physically in a way he could not as an 18-year-old pro.
“You become a part of a team that is more important than individual success,” Blake said. “Starting as a freshman and paying your dues is a great learning tool. I probably played more matches in a school year than I did in almost any full year on tour. Nothing else builds confidence and makes you feel comfortable on the court like winning.”
While Blake stands now at 6’1”, early on his short stature earned him the nickname “Squirt Gun” from members of the Harvard tennis team.
“He used to come to [Harvard] matches when he was in high school,” said Kunj Majmudar ’99, Blake’s doubles partner at Harvard. “My early memories of him were when he was a little kid, and he wasn’t that big.”
Playing Ivy League tennis allowed Blake’s body to develop physically. As he put on muscle, his forehand—which was clocked at 125 miles per hour in 2011—became a Tour-level weapon and the center of his game. The relatively relaxed environment of Cambridge allowed the 18-year old to refine his technique and find an identity in his game.
“I don’t know that his body would have held up if he had gone right back on tour like a lot of the other guys that went out of high school,” Thomas said. “It was a good intermediate step where the competition was better than the juniors but not as good as on Tour. It let him get stronger without being under a ton of pressure and not having to battle for a living.”
Blake’s route was unusual, but certainly not unique. Many of tennis’ big hitters, including top-20 players Kevin Anderson and John Isner, were All-American college players first and pros second. Isner, who trained with Blake in Tampa, Fl., said the pressure of collegiate tennis prepared him well for the Tour.
“You’re not playing for yourself—you’re playing for your teammates and you’re playing for your school,” Isner said. “Playing in a very big, very heated college tennis match is about as pressure-packed a situation as you can get.... I’ve been more nervous playing college tennis than I ever have been actually playing in the pros.”
Blake’s juniors experience may have prepared him somewhat for the level of competition, but not for the team atmosphere of college tennis.
“It’s an individual sport, so we don’t have that many opportunities to feel like part of a team,” Blake said. “But when we do, they are usually memorable.  The screaming of ‘Go Crimson’ after every big point and the support was so much fun during dual matches.”
A change in the format did not affect Blake’s excellence on the court. When he began competing as a freshman, “Squirt Gun” quickly became more deserving of his older brother’s nickname—“Tommy Gun.” The freshman blew past all expectations, teaming up with Majmudar and upsetting the top-seeded doubles team in just the duo’s fourth match together en route to the NCAA quarterfinals.
Blake’s meteoric rise continued in his sophomore year, when he became the first Ivy League player ever to win both the singles and doubles tournament at the ITA All-American tournament, a collegiate Grand Slam event.
“He was improving so fast that agents were calling me all the time to see if they could get an in with him,” Fish said.
Over winter break, Blake won a low-level professional tournament. The sophomore, who said the win “made me realize that I had a chance to play on that level,” had a decision to make. He had always planned to finish college, but collegiate tennis no longer offered a high enough level of competition.
“As the best guy in college, when you have outpaced your opponents in college, you can talk about it a bit more,” Fish said. “He needed more challenge at that point and the college game wasn’t giving it to him.”
Blake delayed the decision until the end of the year. In the NCAA tournament, he battled to the singles title before falling to the second-seeded player, University of Florida’s Jeff Morrison. That summer, he was chosen as a practice partner for the U.S. Davis Cup team. After discussing it through with Fish, Blake turned pro.
“I think it began to be clear that if he was going to be offered so much money that he could pay for school many times over and have a safety net to go out on the Tour for a couple years without risking everything, then he should go for it,” Fish said. “If I am telling him to stay in college so that we can win a lot more matches, that’s a lot like trying to staple a leaf back onto a tree.”
LIFE ON THE TOUR
Blake joined his brother in the pro ranks in the summer of 1999, teaming with Thomas in doubles at the U.S. Open. No longer playing for a team, the 19-year-old James found the atmosphere of the Tour a world apart from Harvard tennis.
“It is an extremely selfish endeavor on tour,” Blake said. “We are playing for ranking points and money out there, but at college, we wore our team colors with pride and played for that. But the intensity level does jump up quite a bit when guys are playing for their livelihood.”
Blake spent the majority of his first two years on tour on the Challenger circuit, slowly moving up the ATP ranks. In 2001, he joined the U.S. Davis Cup team. By the end of that year, he broke into the top 75. By mid-2003, Blake had risen as high as No. 22 in the world, won his first career ATP title, and reached the third round of the U.S. Open.
Then, disaster struck. In 2004, when it rained for Blake, it poured. In May, Blake slipped on a line at the Italian Open, breaking his neck. Two months later, his father, who had been diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer, passed away. In the midst of this, Blake developed shingles.
By April 2005, his ranking had dropped all the way to No. 210. He returned to the Challenger circuit, playing for four—not six—figure paychecks. Driven by his hardships, Blake began regaining some of his success—and more.
“His life became much more real,” Fish said. “It focused his energies in a way nothing ever had before. Things had come very easily before, and he thought that his was a chance he would never get again.”
A revitalized Blake, as always, found success at home. He made back-to-back U.S. Open quarterfinals in 2005 and 2006, rising to No. 4 in the world by the end of 2006. The former Davis Cup hitting partner was the world’s top-ranked American, a skeletal frame belying his power game.
“When he was on, when he was hot and in the zone, he could absolutely beat anybody in the world,” Isner said. “He just crushed the ball and it would somehow find the court. For being not such a big guy, he could hit the crap out of the ball.”
Blake’s signature shot was his screaming forehand, but he quickly earned praise for other parts of his game. The 25-year-old quickly developed a reputation as one of the best returners in tennis.
“If his opponent hit a very big serve to his forehand, or his opponent hit a big forehand to his, he used pace,” Isner said. “He could return a serve harder than his opponent hit the actual serve.”
On the Tour, Blake found joy once again in its only team competition—the Davis Cup. In 2007, the team of Blake, Roddick, and the Bryan brothers defeated Russia to win the title for the first time since 1995.
“[That was] the most special moment of my career,” Blake said. “We had so many great and tough times together. To finally win it and have all of us contribute was an amazing feeling.  We have so few opportunities to play as a team and that one was the pinnacle for us.”
Competing for the United States brought out some of Blake’s best tennis. At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, Blake upset top-seeded Roger Federer in straight sets to reach the medal rounds. But Blake failed to reach the podium, losing to the Fernando Gonzalez in the semifinals and to Novak Djokovic in the bronze medal match.
“Playing for your country is different because you feel such a sense of pride and duty,” Blake said. “[You are] so proud to wear USA on your chest, but also aware of all the great players that have worn it before and what they accomplished.”
THE END
After success in 2008, age and injuries began taking their toll on Blake’s body, and the American would never crack the top 10 following the 2009 Australian Open. At a time when the average top 10 player was less than 24 years old, the 29-year old’s body left him on the outside looking in.
As his body wore down, Blake began to consider ending his career.
“I knew my body couldn’t handle the type of training I used to be capable of,” Blake said. “So that would reflect in my results being less than what I thought I could do.  When that became apparent to me and that I couldn’t improve the way I used to, I thought it was time to stop.”
Entering the 2013 U.S. Open, the 33-year old had struggled to find his previous form. He had failed to qualify for the Australian Open and had won only one major singles match all year.
Before the tournament started, Blake made clear it would be his last. His brother cited the relentless grind of the Tour—unlike other sports, tennis has no offseason—as the main factor pushing him to consider retirement.
“It isn’t like other professional sports in that you are playing 11 months out of the year, and that month off, you have your charity events and are still traveling,” Thomas said. “He had been doing that for 15 years, and you get worn out. At that level, if you cannot give it your all then the guys at that level are just too good, regardless of how you are hitting the ball.”
Blake bypassed qualifying rounds into the U.S. Open after being given a wild card by the tournament, and was slotted to play Karlovic for his first-round match.
The end was short—after falling to Karlovic, Blake waved at the fans in Armstrong Stadium, the final time he would do so as a singles player. Blake said that after he walked off the court, he was honored by the amount of support he received.
“People I hadn’t heard from in years were texting or e-mailing to congratulate me and wish me luck in retirement,” Blake said. “Juan Martin del Potro, Andy Murray, and Alex Bogomolov [greeted me] after my last match in the locker room. They waited around to wish me well, and that was such a classy move by them and I will not forget it.”
Reflecting back, Blake acknowledged that he would never experience anything quite like the Tour again.
“I will miss the competition and the friendships the most about the tour,” Blake said. “I realize I won’t ever feel that same pressure of a fifth-set tiebreaker or anything like that after my career, and I loved those moments. The friendships I made were special to me and I will remain close with many of the guys on tour, but not seeing them in the locker rooms every week will be different.”
That loss was one felt not just by Blake, but by friends and fellow players on the Tour, some of whom Blake played with for years. Support poured in over the days following his announcement, both directly to him and over social media.
“It’s going to be a little bit of an adjustment for me, and for everybody, really, to not see him around in the locker room anymore,” Isner said. “[His retirement] was pretty tough for me to swallow, and a lot of other guys are good friends with him. But I think he went out his way—he had an incredible career given all the setbacks and everything he had to overcome. He had an incredible career, I think a career that he never could have imagined having.”
Blake’s setbacks might have broken a lesser player. No one would have faulted him for quitting in 2005. But he kept going, reaching the pinnacle of his career the next year with encouragement from his friends and coaches.
“Part of his success is that he puts in a lot of hard work and a lot of time,” Majmudar said. “But I think also a big part of his success is how he handled success and stayed grounded.... While you can’t necessarily quantify that, that was a definitely a large part of his success, especially when he went through difficult times.”
It is easy to see Blake’s career as that of an overachiever. The “pencil of a kid” played twentieth-century power tennis in a different era; when injuries sapped his strokes of their power, he won on guts and experience. In his 15 years after leaving the safe confines of the Murr Center, Blake battled back from adversity on and off the court. Even his trademark doggedness occasionally did him in—his 2004 neck injury came from an inadvertent dive into the net post, trying to recover a drop shot.
Yet, the title of overachiever demeans and trivializes Blake’s success. Harvard’s most famous tennis player had wins on the biggest of stages—from the junior courts in Kalamazoo to the fortress of Arthur Ashe—and the talent to match it. In the end, perhaps it would be more accurate to term Blake an achiever. Looking back, his brother said that Blake can rest satisfied on a career that had a little bit of everything.
“He always says and our coach always stressed that when you retire you want to look back and feel like you gave it your all,” Thomas said. “And I think he can look back and say he did that.”

CORRECTION: Jan. 7, 2014
 
An earlier version of this story misstated the name of the tennis facility where the Blake brothers “bloomed” as young players. In fact, it was the Tennis Club of Trumbull not the Trumbull Tennis Center.

Reading period is almost here, and students’ sleep schedules are sure to take a brutal hit. Mugs full of Lipton black tea and nondescript coffee will inevitably dot library tables, but why settle for the usual dining hall drinks to get your energy fix? Mix it up with these alternative sources of caffeine.
 
 
J.P. Licks Cappuccino Crunch Ice Cream
If you’re not worried about the extra calories (note: at this time of year, you shouldn't be), then ice cream is a delicious option for staying awake. One of the main ingredients of this J.P. Licks favorite is coffee, and that extra sugar high can't hurt either. Forego the double scoop this time, though—the ensuing food coma might counteract the caffeine. 
 
X8 Energy Gum
One small stick of this gum contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee. The brand even claims that the gum will “increase mental awareness,” which you’ll have to test out for yourself. Just be careful not to chew it loudly and obnoxiously in the library.
 
Perky Jerky
Yes, there is actually a food product with this name. And yes, this is actually beef jerky jam-packed with caffeine. (It also comes in Turkey jerky form.) You might even get some extra brain power from all that protein.
 
Yerba Mate Tea 
Derived from naturally caffeinated plants, mate tea is all the rage within health-conscious communities (read: California hippie-types love it). Try out the Guayaki brand—the tea is pretty tasty and won’t stink up your breath like coffee. Plus, mate has about far more caffeine then regular black tea.
 
Sprayable Energy
This is how Sprayable Energy works: you spray a “caffeine secret sauce” onto your neck like perfume, your skin absorbs the caffeine, and you become more alert. Sure, it’s a little strange, but spritzing your neck to get your caffeine fix is also pretty simple.

The #Harvardinautumn social media campaign has produced a plethora of posts containing vibrant foliage, dusky evenings, and preppy fleeces. It's produced such an idyllic picture of the fall season you can almost smell the pumpkin-spiced latte. But fall at Harvard can also be pretty darn ugly. For the sake of creating a more honest portrait, we’ve rounded up a few images of the real #Harvardinautumn.

By now, you’ve probably woken up from your turkey-induced coma and gotten back into your normal weekday routine (just in time for reading period to start and mess with it again). And let’s be real—the only exercise you got over break was from stampeding innocent fellow shoppers on Black Friday. So, to help you lose those post-Turkeyday pounds, Flyby suggests taking some of these easy steps:
1) Walk to the MAC. Slip into your sneakers, grab your blender ball, and prepare your body for exhaustion. While there are plenty of fitness classes available inside the Malkin Athletic Center, these are really all superfluous. After a pleasant stroll to and fro, you should start to feel the pounds melting away.
2) Force yourself to eat in Annenberg. Rigorous exercise (Step 1) is really only half the battle—the other half is diet. By making yourself visit Annenberg for every meal you will guarantee that you will rarely overeat. This even applies to upperclassmen, who might want to sneak in and relive their frosh days.
3) If you do decide to venture out into the gastronomic paradise that is Cambridge, make sure that you eat right. Stick exclusively to healthy foods, like Yogurtland. It’s just frozen yogurt, which is just frozen milk, so it’s just frozen calcium. Don’t worry.
4) Visit a friend in the Quad. Undoubtedly, the trek to this distant region of the galaxy is arduous but will pay dividends if you are trying to drop that turkey weight. If you get winded, you can always hail the shuttle to take you the rest of the way.  For extra motivation, promise to treat yourself to Insomnia when you get back.
5) Train like Rocky. Put on some grey sweat pants (don’t worry, no one will judge), jog around Harvard, and punch a ton of meat in a local butcher shop. Finally, run the steps of Widener and bask in your own glory. Pump-up music optional.

We all know about the disgusting "poopetrator" who roamed the halls of Yale earlier this fall, but lesser known is the “Pooh-petrator” targeting the beloved Winnie the Pooh house next to Harvard’s Science Center. Apparently, a pooh-petrator has been stealing the sacred door to Winnie the Pooh’s house since the summer, and keeps coming back. Luckily, our friends from Cambridge Rindge and Latin have come to the rescue time and again.
Flyby spoke with Betsy Bard, the teacher from Cambridge Rindge and Latin who noticed when Winnie the Pooh’s door went missing and decided to do something about it. Bard works at the daycare center for teen parents and teachers at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, and she said that she and the daycare students go to the Science Center about once a week to see Winnie the Pooh. While visiting Pooh’s house one day in the fall, the daycare students realized that the house had no door, so they took matters to a carpentry class at the high school.
“The kids in the class said they’d take measurements [for the door] and make a new door…those kids were really proud of it,” Bard said. The carpentry students heroically installed their first replacement Pooh door in October.
Then, a few weeks ago, Bard realized that the door had been stolen by yet another pooh-petrator.
The Winnie the Pooh house was clearly very important to the Cambridge and Harvard students, so the carpentry class once again came to the rescue. The students in the carpentry class made another door for Winnie the Pooh’s house. This time, Bard's daycare students helped out, making notes telling people that Winnie the Pooh needed a door for the winter. As adorable as the gesture from the daycare center was, the pooh-petrator was not phased. A few days later, Bard said, the door was stolen yet again.
Our heroes from the Cambridge Rindge and Latin carpentry class have just completed yet another door for the Pooh house.
As for the “pooh-petrator,” it appears that he or she is still on the loose, though Bard has alerted the police of the situation. So Pooh-petrator, beware. No one messes with Winnie the Pooh’s house.
