After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Robert W. Healy’s last Cambridge City Council meeting as city manager Monday evening, the Council made a move to look into divestment from fossil fuels.
Council members unanimously approved a policy order resolution from Councillor Leland Cheung requesting that the City Manager “urge the Cambridge Retirement Board of Trustees to review Cambridge’s investment portfolio to consider divestment from fossil fuel companies and report back to the City Council.”
The policy order also resolved that the “City Council go on record supporting the principle of fossil fuel divestment.” Councillor Craig A. Kelley said in an interview after the meeting that the vote on the divestment policy order is a request to look at divestment as a possibility rather than a decision to divest.
The policy order, one of several passed on Monday, did not spur debate from Council members at the time of the meeting.
Several Cambridge residents addressed the divestment policy order during at the start of the meeting during the public comment period, including James M. Recht, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
“Our city boasts a reputation of leadership in human rights and public health issues, and that reputation for leadership carries responsibilities,” Recht said, speaking in support of the policy order. “Our city has the strongest possible reasons for acting now.”
Also on Monday evening, members of the Council thanked Healy for his decades of service to the city.
Healy, who has served as Cambridge’s chief executive since 1981, announced in March 2012 that he planned to leave Cambridge city government. Last month, the Harvard Kennedy School announced that Healy would serve as a Taubman Fellow at the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston. Healy will teach as an adjunct lecturer and work with Kennedy School affiliates on a variety of projects.
Richard C. Rossi, the deputy city manager, has been appointed to a three-year term as Cambridge’s next city manager.
At the meeting Monday, the Council unanimously approved a policy order requesting that the new city manager act to commission a portrait of Healy, which will hang in the Manager’s office. The policy order also renamed the office the “Robert W. Healy, Jr. Executive Suite.”
At the end of the meeting, members of the Council addressed Healy with words of gratitude.
“Over the decades that you have served, your name has been synonymous with city hall itself, and your influence on our municipal government is unquestioned,” Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons said.
"There's nothing complicated to say except thank you," Councillor Marjorie C. Decker said. "You have been an integral part of really shaping the narrative of what the community is."
After the meeting, Cambridge mayor Henrietta J. Davis praised Healy’s work as the city’s Manager.
“He’s had a great long career and has had an influence on everything in the city, especially affordable housing, human services, and putting the city on a strong financial footing,” Davis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As University President Drew G. Faust applauded the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on race-conscious college admissions Monday, several legal experts said they do not expect the decision to end holistic admissions processes like Harvard’s.
In the case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, Abigail N. Fisher sued the University of Texas at Austin, saying that she was denied admission in 2008 because she is white.
In a 7-1 decision that both advocates and opponents of affirmative action claimed as a victory, the Court did not directly address the constitutionality of the University of Texas at Austin’s policies, instead sending the case back to the lower courts for further review. The majority opinion, delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy, argued that the lower courts did not “apply the correct standard of strict scrutiny,” which stipulates that universities must show there are not race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action that can achieve the same goal. Still, the opinion affirmed that universities have an interest in encouraging diversity in their student bodies and may consider race as one factor, among others, in the admission process, as outlined in previous decisions.
In a statement posted on Harvard University’s website Monday, Faust lauded the Court’s decision as a victory for universities with holistic admissions processes.
“We are heartened that the Supreme Court today has affirmed the vital interest of universities in bringing together students from many different backgrounds and points of view,” Faust wrote. “Such diversity enriches the learning experience for all our students, as they live and learn in a community whose collective variety of experiences, interests, and perspectives opens minds, expands horizons, and better prepares students to live and serve in a pluralistic world.”
Several legal experts interviewed for this article said they believe the ruling is unlikely to bring about staggering changes to race-conscious admissions processes at schools like Harvard.
"Certainly Harvard is going take a position that its program has been repeatedly ruled positively by the Supreme Court, and so it will take a position that it doesn't have to do anything, and that's almost certainly right,” Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 said. “I don't think there will be any effect on whatever it is that Harvard is doing in the area.”
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, added that in the wake of the ruling, "race-conscious admissions in some form or [an]other may still be able to survive into the future.”
Still, legal experts said the decision may lead to greater scrutiny of affirmative action programs.
"I don't think there is a lot new there,” said Tomiko Brown-Nagin, a Law School professor who jointly submitted an amicus brief on the case with Law School professor Lani Guinier ’71 on behalf of Advancement Project, a nonprofit civil rights organization. “Most of what is in that opinion has been said before.... At the same time, the major stress through the opinion is that the federal courts must scrutinize in a very robust way how universities are actually implementing their affirmative action policies.”
Brown-Nagin added that she was not speaking about the impact of the ruling at Harvard specifically.
Lake said that another significant implication of the ruling could be the filing of further lawsuits challenging affirmative action programs.
“[Sending the case back to the lower courts] virtually guarantees that the Court will look at these issues again,” Lake said.
Harvard has used a race-conscious admissions process for years. In the Fisher case, the University, along with several peer institutions, submitted an amicus brief defending the University of Texas’s policies. Harvard’s admission program was also cited as an example of a constitutional affirmative action policy in the majority opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court decision that set a precedent for the acceptable use of race as a criterion of admission in higher education.

BOSTON—As the final voters cast their ballots in the state’s special election Tuesday evening, the two men vying for the Commonwealth’s open Senate seat gathered with supporters at two hotels here to take in returns and, they hoped, to celebrate a victory.
 
At the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers in Back Bay, supporters of U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey, the veteran Malden Democrat that analysts expect to win the election, gathered before a massive American flag and a well-stocked bar and buffet. Markey, who has served in Congress for 37 years, has had the support and assistance of influential Democrats from the start, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Secretary of State John F. Kerry, President Barack Obama, and a host of other officials. In April, he cruised to victory in the Democratic primary over South Boston Congressman Stephen F. Lynch.
 
Markey’s opponent, Republican businessman Gabriel E. Gomez, gathered his supporters at the Seaport Boston Hotel. After an easy victory in the Republican primary in April, Gomez, a former Navy SEAL, has struggled to drum up the same swells of support that propelled then-state senator Scott P. Brown to a surprise victory over state Attorney General Martha Coakley in a special Senate election here in 2010.
 
On Monday, Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, the state’s chief election official, predicted a record low turnout of just 1.6 million voters, or about 37 percent of the Massachusetts electorate. Conversely, in the 2010 special Senate election, more than half of the electorate went to the polls, in part representing a surge of independent voters who supported Brown.

UPDATED: June 26, 2013, at 1:09 a.m. 
BOSTON—Edward J. Markey, a Malden Democrat and 37-year veteran of the House of Representatives, became the nation’s newest Senator-elect Tuesday night, riding a wave of party support to defeat Republican challenger Gabriel E. Gomez in a special election to fill the seat vacated earlier this year by Secretary of State John F. Kerry.
“This election is about your hopes, your dreams, your families, your future. And I know that,” Markey told a crowd of his supporters gathered at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel in Back Bay after the race was called.
Earlier in the evening, when returns showed that Markey had gained the advantage in votes counted, a cheer erupted among Markey supporters in the hotel’s ballroom. As Markey’s lead expanded, the atmosphere grew more and more celebratory. The Associated Press called the election for Markey shortly before 9:15 p.m., and final vote tallies late Tuesday night showed a 10-point victory for Markey, 55 percent to 45 percent.
In a race which drew little attention even within the Commonwealth, Markey boasted a vast field operation. According to campaign spokesperson Andrew Zucker, 7,200 volunteers made about one million voter contact attempts on Tuesday alone. In the four days before the vote, Zucker said, 15,000 volunteers made three million voter contact attempts. All told, 19,000 volunteers worked for the Markey campaign, according to Zucker.
Markey also received help from party leadership. Perhaps the three most recognizable Democrats in the nation—President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Vice President Joe Biden—each made a trip to the Commonwealth to stump for Markey, as did former president Bill Clinton.
“When you get major figures like Obama and Bill Clinton and Joe Biden coming into the state, that tells Massachusetts voters that this is a nationally important contest,” Dan Payne, a Democratic political consultant who has done work for Markey, said in a phone interview after the race was called.
Gomez, on the other hand, struggled to generate the energy and enthusiasm that propelled Republican then-state senator Scott P. Brown to a surprise victory over his Democratic opponent, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, in a 2010 special Senate election. While, like Brown, Gomez cruised to an easy victory in the Republican primary, by many accounts he lacked Brown’s charm and engagement on the campaign trail and observers said his performance in televised debates against Markey was up and down.
Some have suggested that Gomez was further hurt by a case of election fatigue in Massachusetts, where voters have been called to the ballot box four times in the past four years for special elections to fill open Senate seats.
On Monday, Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin, the state’s chief election official, predicted a record-low turnout of just 1.6 million voters, or about 37 percent of the Massachusetts electorate. Conversely, in the 2010 special Senate election, more than half of the electorate went to the polls, in part representing a surge of independent voters who supported Brown. As of Tuesday night, Galvin’s estimate appeared ambitious; with all precincts reporting, only about 1.17 million ballots had been tallied.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A student’s self-reported financial aid status was made public to the student body Monday when a College administrator inadvertently replied-all to the student’s email inquiring about Pre-Term Planning.
Writing from a Pre-Term Planning email account, Assistant Dean of Undergraduate Education Katherine Stanton carbon-copied her reply to the student’s email to a Pre-Term Planning Mailman list, which went directly to other College students’ accounts. In the accidentally shared email, the student identified as “a financial aid student.”
The Crimson reached the student via email on Tuesday and chose not to publish a name in order to protect the student’s privacy.
In an emailed statement Tuesday, College spokesperson Colin Manning described the incident as “an inadvertent and regrettable mistake.”
“The Office of Undergraduate Education apologizes for the error. Student privacy is of the utmost importance, and OUE is working to put in place controls to prevent something like this from happening again," Manning wrote.
The College Handbook for Students’ statement of privacy for financial information states that “all information submitted for the purpose of securing financial aid is protected under Harvard’s Enterprise Security policy, the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act of 2000 (GLB). Under these provisions, Harvard ensures the privacy and safeguarding of all financial aid information.” The statement does not directly address a policy regarding students’ statements about their financial aid status.

One of the most accomplished rowing coaches in history, Harvard men’s heavyweight crew coach Harry Parker died Tuesday. He was 77.
He arrived at Harvard in 1960 and became head coach following the death of Harvey Love in 1962. In his 51 seasons leading the Crimson, Parker coached the team to 22 undefeated regular seasons, the most recent of which was this spring, and a combined 16 official and unofficial national championships.
“Harry Parker has been one of the nation's iconic coaches and educators," Athletic Director Bob Scalise said in a statement. "He has touched the lives and has influenced countless Harvard oarsmen over the years. His love of the sport, dedication to the success of his students and devotion to Harvard are evident in all Harry has done. His legacy and impact on our program over the last five decades will remain. We will miss him as a coach, role model, leader and a friend."
Before Harvard, Parker competed in the 1960 Olympics in the single scull. He went on to coach six Olympic teams, including the 1972 men’s eight that won a silver medal.
A resident of Winchester, MA, Parker is survived by his wife, Kathy Keeler, two sons, George and David, and a daughter, Abigail.

Five current and former Harvard women’s hockey players edged another step closer to the Olympics as USA Hockey announced its 25-player U.S. Women’s National Team in a press conference Monday morning. Rising seniors Lyndsey Fry and Josephine Pucci and rising junior Michelle Picard will join Crimson alumnae Kate Buesser ’11 and Julie Chu ’06-’07 as members of the squad that will begin a residency training program in September based at The Edge Sports Center in Bedford, Mass.
Harvard and Minnesota were the top-represented NCAA schools on the roster, each with five players named to the team. The squad will train under Katey Stone, the head coach of both the Harvard team and Team USA. This season, Stone coached the Crimson to her 402nd career win and led this past year’s National Team to a gold medal at the 2013 World Championships.
“I think we’re going to be fast,” Stone said at the press conference. “I think we’re going to play a very up-tempo puck possession game. We’re going to play great defense, and that’s where we’re going to start. We’ve got a lot of threatening players, so we’re going to make it very difficult to play against in all three zones.”
Fry and Picard were instrumental to this year’s Crimson team, which earned its first NCAA tournament slot since 2010. Fry, the team’s second leading scorer with 16 goals and 20 assists, will join Chu and Buesser at forward. Chu, the oldest member of the squad, is a three-time Olympian with two silvers and a bronze to her name. Picard, who helped the Crimson rank first in penalty killing percentage in its conference, will team up with Pucci, who took this past year off due to injury, as defensemen.
The squad was chosen after a weeklong selection camp that included 41 top American players in Lake Placid, N.Y. Jillian Dempsey ’13 was invited to try out but did not make the final team. The team, which currently numbers 25, will be pared down to a 21-player Olympic roster by late December 2013 and look for gold in Sochi, Russia, in February 2014.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a resounding straight-set win against Thiemo de Bakker on Tuesday, James Blake is once again in the second round of Wimbledon. It is the first win in five first-round efforts for Blake, who had not won a main draw match since the Sony Open in March, where he won two rounds before falling to Spaniard Albert Ramos in three sets.
Blake was the No. 1 rated college player as a Harvard sophomore in 1999, before dropping out to join the pro tour.
Against de Bakker, Blake surrendered just six games in breaking his opponent in every set. He amassed 17 break points and converted six of them, a low 35 percent conversion rate that was offset by his strong serving. The Yonkers, New York native had seven aces against just one double fault and won 88 percent of his first serve points. He allowed his opponent only one break point, which he saved.
After reaching a high of number four in the world in 2006, Blake has slowly slipped down the rankings over the last four years due to a combination of inconsistency and injury. Throughout it all, Blake’s one-handed backhand has always been a volatile stroke. When it shows up, he can play with anyone—as evidenced by his wins over all-time greats Roger Federer (2008 Olympics) and Rafael Nadal (2006 U.S. Open). However, he is prone to spray balls off that wing and as he has gotten older, Blake has struggled to defend his backhand as well as he once did by running around to hit inside-out forehands.
Blake, a former ATP Comeback Player of the Year, has been making yet another charge up the rankings. He started the year ranked no. 123, needing to play qualifying to get into the Australian Open. His ranking is up to 96, with a boost that will come from the second-round (or better) points he gets from Wimbledon.
Blake will have a challenge Thursday against either Sam Querrey or Bernard Tomic to reach the third round for the third time ever and the first time since 2007.
