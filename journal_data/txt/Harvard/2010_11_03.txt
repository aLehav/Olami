After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having made considerable gains in both houses of Congress, Republicans will soon undertake their much-anticipated attempt to improve the economy by getting the government out of the way of the private sector. True, the current occupant of the White House and a strong Democratic presence in the Senate will sharply limit the GOP’s ability to cut taxes and regulation, but the new members of Congress will inevitably contribute to a recovery over the next two years merely by reducing government activity and thus economic uncertainty.
On Sunday, economist Kevin A. Hassett published an analysis of America’s economic health during periods of unified and divided government, the latter of which occurs when at least one chamber of Congress is controlled by the party opposite the president’s. Since 1970, divided government has witnessed median GDP growth of 3.3 percent and median unemployment of 5.7 percent in years of divided government, compared with three percent GDP growth and 6.1 percent unemployment during one-party rule. Equity markets, Hassett says, have “practically jumped for joy at political division” since 1970: The Standard & Poor 500 has grown at a median rate of 13.5 percent per year under divided government and 9 percent per year during unified government, and the spread is more than twice that amount since the beginning of the Clinton administration.
This is presumably because the government doesn’t accomplish as much when the two parties share control. Bolstering this hypothesis is data indicating that equity markets do better when Congress is out of session and thus passing no laws. A 1997 University of North Carolina at Charlotte study found that almost the entire advance in the stock market since 1897 corresponds to the periods when Congress was in recess and that cumulative returns, throughout the year, during recesses are thirteen times those experienced while Congress is in session.
But is the government less active when it is divided between the two parties? One way of answering this question is by examining the “Congressional Quarterly” presidential success score, which quantifies the percentage of congressional votes on which the president’s position prevails—if this entails passing a bill, the president will sign it. Success scores tend to be higher during one-party control of government, a pattern that has been reaffirmed during the current Congress: Obama’s 2009 score was 96.7 percent, higher than that of any other president since Congressional Quarterly began keeping track over fifty years ago. The next closest score is Lyndon B. Johnson’s 93 percent in 1965, at the beginning of which Democrats enjoyed more than two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate.
While this metric might be dismissed on the grounds that it counts defeats of bills opposed by the president as successes, such votes are unlikely to be frequent when the president’s party controls the congressional agenda. This is certainly true of the current Congress, which has spent most of its time debating President Obama’s economic program.
The problem with a Congress that has a serious chance of enacting legislation with sweeping economic consequences is that investment decisions must be based in part on what the government is likely to do, making individuals less likely to take the risks needed to generate growth. Hiring and investment were surely deterred by the uncertain prospect of higher taxes and the employer mandate during the yearlong debate over healthcare reform as well as the new regulations in the Dodd-Frank financial oversight bill that became law during the summer.
Irrespective of the impact of healthcare reform and Dodd-Frank, private actors now know the rules of the game, and those rules are unlikely to change for the next two years since most of the president’s economic proposals will no longer be on the agenda. Republicans can now easily block the Employee Free Choice Act, which would have established mandatory government arbitration for organized labor contracts and made it much easier for employees to unionize. Another casualty of the elections is the Paycheck Fairness Act, currently under consideration in the Senate, which would facilitate pay discrimination lawsuits. Also off the table are the proposed tax increase on carried interest and the bank tax, or “Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee,” both of which would have hampered investment by making risk taking less profitable. Perhaps most significantly, there is little if any chance the government will ration fossil fuel use through a cap-and-trade system, or approve more stimulus spending that would affect interest rates and ultimately require higher taxes. Holding other factors constant, the economy should improve during the next Congress since investors and employers no longer have to account for how these policies would affect their bottom line.
Thanks to Republican electoral victories, private sector decisions over the next two years will be made based on how consumers—and not the government—are likely to behave. Perhaps after its members are sworn in, Congress could simply adjourn until 2012. It wouldn’t be the worst thing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the proudly crass gossip website Gawker revealed that Christine T. O’Donnell had a one-night sleepover with a stranger three years ago, according to the anonymous stranger himself. Although in this instance the disclosure was particularly relevant given O’Donnell’s outspoken moral platform, information relevant to voters, including personal choices, ought to be shared regardless of the circumstances.
Given the ubiquity of the media and the insatiable curiosity for political and sexual scandal, stories like O’Donnell’s have become commonplace. However, while some journalists have criticized Gawker’s decision to distribute this particular story, the site deserves commendation, if only for allowing voters a fuller depiction of those vying to become their future representatives.
Considering that O’Donnell’s campaign for a Senate seat in Delaware has repeatedly accentuated the politician’s stringent personal moral code, scrutiny of her past personal actions is especially appropriate. O’Donnell has worn her strict standards on her sleeve, explicitly ascribing a moral authority to them. Since these standards are alienating to some, her consistency in abiding by them is important to discuss. Ultimately, her campaign has given voters little else of substance to evaluate her on beyond these values.
Despite the laudability of Gawker’s disclosure of O’Donnell’s sexual encounter, the timing—just a week before O’Donnell’s midterm election—was unfortunate. If Gawker held the story until the final week intentionally, then we express our disappointment in the site. If, on the other hand, the anonymous source waited to reveal the story in order to garner more attention, then he deserves condemnation. Revealing the encounter last week gave voters insufficient time for voters to process the event or question its validity before the election, suggesting that those responsible for the timing likely did not wish O’Donnell success as a candidate.
While use of an anonymous source may call into question a story’s credibility, journalists’ ability to cite individuals without revealing their identities is essential to the trade. Without such allowances, important stories like this may never have been revealed. In specific cases, anonymity allows relevant information to be shared that otherwise would never be disseminated.
Under fire from the New York Times, the National Organization for Women and, of course, the O’Donnell campaign, Gawker’s explanation for its decision to publish the piece was an admirable response. Its reasoning holds up, and despite the timing, Gawker’s disclosure proved to be useful in evaluating the Delaware candidates for senator.

November is quickly approaching—leaves are piling on the ground, temperatures are getting chillier, and most importantly, the Harvard-Yale football game is almost here. “The Game” symbolizes centuries of long-lasting rivalry between the two schools, and as part of this excitement, we display our Crimson loyalty through Harvard-glorifying t-shirts, which will soon be on sale. These t-shirts raise money for student groups, help build anticipation for The Game, and are a fun part of the annual traditions. However, it is important that we not let our impassioned support for the football team and desire to surpass our New Haven rival sanction apparel that is deeply offensive and degrades women.
Even where there is no aggressive or violent intent, many Harvard-Yale t-shirt designs constitute attacks on the female population and endorse a negative message over which we as a community should be striving to triumph. Last year, the Yale Freshmen Class Council decided to not use what the freshmen class voted on to be their Harvard-Yale t-shirt; after an outcry. The original shirt, which read “I think of all Harvard men as Sissies,” referencing the quotation from F. Scott Fitzgerald, was pulled before it could even be printed. It was decided that the use of the word “sissies” as an insult plays too well into a history of its use to disparage members of the queer community. Making the decision to censor the shirt not only protected the marginalized but also protected the integrity of Yale’s image. In the same vein, we should protect students in our community from the intensely offensive connotations of certain t-shirt designs that degrade women, promote sexual violence, or positively allude to rape, by speaking out against the design and sale of such t-shirts, and most importantly, not buying them.
In the past, I have seen Harvard-Yale shirts that, in the name of cleverness, glorify aggressive if not violent male sexual dominance in both language and imagery. Among them is a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words “Bulldog… Just a Fancy Word for Bitch,” depicting the disconcerting image of a Harvard pioneer raising a paddle to a crouching Yale bulldog. Another shirt most likely recycled from this design depicts a bulldog being walked on a leash by a semblance of John Harvard. This image is an obvious portrayal of sexist imagery as it is intentionally meant to make the bulldog look subservient to a dominant male figure. Likewise, another past t-shirt depicts a Yale bulldog kneeling in front of a representation of a muscular Harvard male mascot, insinuating lewd behavior and configuring women as sexual objects. Not to mention the more recent, overtly insulting design “Veritas Bitches.” That shirt in particular undeniably uses destructive, caustic language, debases women, and seems to connote rape. The design shows our John Harvard mascot yielding two swords and menacingly looking at the outspread legs of a bulldog.
Such shirts portray blatant sexual overtones which are fundamentally problematic. Women are not things to be sexually dominated by men and using that paradigm as a basis for a joke is offensive, damaging, and cheap. Walking around in such explicitly degrading apparel in the name of school spirit in no way brings glory to our team.
Moving forward it is important to make a conscious effort to ensure that a long-standing football rivalry does not also maintain long-standing systems of gender oppression. All of the work and media we produce should be reflective of the respect we feel for other students on this campus. We should live by this principle every day and should not compromise it during the frenzy of Harvard-Yale weekend.

Asked once his thoughts on pragmatism, the late Columbia University professor Sidney Morgenbesser is said to have replied: “It’s all very well in theory, but it doesn’t work in practice.”
Like a bad party guest, that last retort wouldn’t leave the mental premises as I made my way through Harvard history professor James T. Kloppenberg’s new book “Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Political Tradition.” Released Sunday, “Reading Obama” is a highly sympathetic account of Obama’s intellectual influences, designed to establish him as no less than “the most penetrating political thinker elected to the presidency in the past century.” But the grab bag of thinkers and ideological positions presented make trying to pin an intellectual label on Obama—like Kloppenberg’s preferred phrase “philosophical pragmatism”—a strained enterprise. Obama may be a shrewd politician, with both a moral vision and knack for the give-and-take required of Oval Office negotiations, but calling him a pragmatist doesn’t make understanding his decisions any easier. In fact, it may actually paper over inconsistencies—both in his own views and in those of pragmatism itself.
For starters, there’s something deeply odd about the book’s emphasis on an “intellectual” account of Obama’s philosophy, excised from his actual career—not only because Obama is a working politician long past kibbutzing about Peirce and Dewey in Langell Hall, but because pragmatism itself rejects the line between theory and application. (A peculiar note in the acknowledgements thanks a historian colleague “working on his own biography of Obama, although he does not share my interest in the importance of ideas in Obama’s life.”) That oddity points to the knottier issue of Kloppenberg’s distinction between “philosophical” and “vulgar” pragmatism. It is a distinction which, as he admits in the book’s introduction, is “not always clear in practice because philosophical pragmatists can and sometimes do recommend what seems simply practical.” But, he says, “I will insist on the difference.” Surely this begs the question—for it is precisely this element of decisionism in pragmatism, the seemingly arbitrary moment that those in power “insist on the difference,” that is itself at stake.
Essential to the mild civic debate Kloppenberg advocates is that no citizen’s view be too strongly argued. Indeed, what Kloppenberg seems to want is disagreement—but not too much. He is against anything that threatens to disrupt what he variously calls “civility” and “comity”—repeatedly dismissing journalists’  “sensation-driven coverage,” which he claims distracts from the “careful scrutiny” Obama’s books deserve; and Nietzsche’s radical perspectivism, which in each of the book’s multiple references becomes a synonym for “valueless, post-Christian nihilism,” and “ensnaring” despair.
The fact that America is actually capable of sustaining these mild disagreements may be because its values are relatively homogeneous. (Tocqueville noted this with some surprise in his travels of America in 1831; modern surveys confirm.) But take Germany, where a major recent upswing in anti-immigrant sentiment threatens to boil over precisely because as an issue it defies consensus. According to a recent poll, one third of Germans want foreigners repatriated; 10 percent of Germans advocate not just a strong leader but a “führer” (a word used in the country today only with reference to Hitler). This month Chancellor Angela Merkel announced that multiculturalism in her country had “utterly failed.” The left’s response trickled forth a few weeks later from liberal darling Jürgen Habermas. Three pages where one would do, discoursing obliquely toward a solution that never quite arrives, the piece terminates abruptly in a three-sentence conclusion: “The United States has a president with a clear-headed political vision, even if he is embattled and now meets with mixed feelings. What is needed in Europe is a revitalized political class that overcomes its own defeatism with a bit more perspective, resoluteness and cooperative spirit. Democracy depends on the belief of the people that there is some scope left for collectively shaping a challenging future.”
The problem with the idea of democracy as a testing ground for “collectively shaping” ideas, however, is that at times values might conflict irreconcilably—or arrive at the “wrong” conclusions. Consensus is itself an empty category; the tragedy of democracy is that it is not always just. If most Germans agreed that Turks and Arabs should be ousted from their country immediately, this would not make it more acceptable. As Obama himself makes no pretense of hiding (writing in “The Audacity of Hope” that “I am robbed even of the certainty of uncertainty—for sometimes absolute truths may well be absolute”) there are certain times when a leader’s rigidly held beliefs may override citizens’. Kloppenberg himself cites the “heroic convictions” of Lincoln’s stance against slavery as an example. But if the philosophy of pragmatism really does require an option to override consensus, its coherence as a doctrine must be questioned.
Perhaps the most troubling line in Kloppenberg’s book comes at the end of the first chapter, when he starkly states: “America in the early twenty-first century has enemies.” He means enemies abroad; that this is taken for granted, in such unequivocal language, sends warning signals. Indeed, the civic tolerance he has Obama advocating seems to break down when it comes to foreign relations. In one of the few critical notes in the book, he writes that: “The strident tone of his inaugural address and startling speed and extent of his expansion of the American military’s role in Afghanistan suggest [that] in the sphere of international relations, Obama may prove no more successful in using philosophical pragmatism to harness his ambitions than Woodrow Wilson.”
So we’re left with this coy evasion: Is he, or isn’t he? Either Obama is not always a philosophical pragmatist, or philosophical pragmatism might not actually be effective—neither of which Kloppenberg wishes to concede. (The link between Obama’s “ambitions” and his pragmatism remains tantalizingly undeveloped.) Times are hard, ideas are soft—averse to absolutes, philosophical pragmatism may come to mean simply whatever it means when implemented. What’s certain is that as considered here it is too broad, and leaves too many questions unanswered, to serve as a satisfactory political theory. After all, if one weren’t already on board with Obama’s actions in office thus far, how would one really feel about a “pragmatist” in the White House?

Five Harvard undergraduates are helping SaferTaxi, a start-up that aims to improve the safety and comfort of taxi rides, launch a free iPhone application for use in the Boston area starting next week.
Founded in 2009 by Wharton student Christian Lechner and second-year Harvard Business School students Clemens H.V. Raemy and Jesus Fernandez, SaferTaxi currently allows users in London and Buenos Aires to submit and access reviews of taxi drivers through a text message-based system.
The iPhone app will allow users to search for reviews of taxi drivers, send text message or e-mail alerts in cases of emergency, and rate their own experiences.
“We encourage people to sign up early and really contribute to the database,” Raemy said. “Every person can help other people within their city. If it’s a bad review or a good review, it doesn’t matter.”
Harvard College Consulting Group members Regan Bozman ’13, Molly L. Yang ’13, Kerry V. Hammond ’14, Brandon Liu ’14, and Natalie C. Sandman ’12 began working with the founders this semester to bring SaferTaxi to college campuses in the Boston area. The undergraduates have contacted area taxi companies to inform them of this new service.
After hailing a cab, a rider can enter the taxi license plate number to receive instant feedback about the driver. A rider can also enable the DoubleSafety feature, which informs an emergency contact if arrival is not confirmed. The application will remind the user to record experiences after each use.
Raemy and his co-founders set out to develop SaferTaxi after what they describe as a dangerous taxi experience in Buenos Aires.But the service could be useful in Boston as well, he said.
“The biggest complaints are that credit card machines aren’t working, drivers are consistently on the phone, and taxis are in really bad condition,” Raemy said, adding that they have come across reports of verbal abuse and sexual advances from drivers in the Boston area in their research.
“As a college woman, in my early 20s, I don’t always feel safe getting into a taxi,” Sandman said. “I think this service provides accountability for the driver, and...it can make the community a better place.”
An Android application for SaferTaxi will be available within the next few months, and students can sign up to receive updates about product development at www.us.safertaxi.com.

Robert C. Darnton ’60, director of Harvard University Library, discussed his new book, “Poetry and the Police: Communication Networks in Eighteenth-Century Paris,” at the Harvard Book Store last night.
The book tells the story of the “Affair of the Fourteen,” a police crackdown in 1749 France that resulted in the arrest of 14 students, young priests, and clerks for unauthorized poetry recitals. It also describes a world in which information traveled orally through songs and poems.
Standing behind a wooden podium, Darnton told the audience that he wrote the book for two purposes: “One is for fun,” he said. “It is written not just for other history professors, but for the general public.”
Darnton related the book to a detective story in which readers follow the police officers as they track the suspects through the streets of Paris.
Darnton said that the second purpose, a more serious one, was to explore the history of communication and understand how information travels. French newspapers in the 18th century faced heavy censorship, so the public relied on gossip and oral communication to gather information, according to Darnton.
“Oral communication system is the most difficult for historians to trace,” Darnton said, “because it disappears through air.”
Poems in 19th century France were disseminated by being copied, read aloud, passed around on pieces of paper, and, most effectively, sung on the streets of Paris, according to Darnton.
“Music is a great mnemonic device,” he said. “Think about it. Isn’t it true you always carry around in your head a repertoire of tunes?”
During the discussion, Darton recited some of the poems in French and played a recording of songs by cabaret artist Hélène Delavault.
“This is a very lovely, simple ballad,” Darnton said, referring to one of the songs.
Emily W. Hogue, resident of Medford and a recent graduate of Bennington College in Bennington, Vt., said she had read one of Darnton’s previous works, “The Great Cat Massacre,” and wanted to hear him speak about his new book. Having studied 18th century England in college, Hogue said that she was interested in reading about France during the same time period.
“I want readers to enjoy themselves, and find that history is, indeed, fun,” Darnton said.

To determine the role of health care reform in the midterm elections, two researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed 17 recent polls and found a sharp divide between Republican and Democratic opinions of the legislation passed eight months ago.
As voters headed to the polls yesterday, many pundits and political commentators billed the 2010 midterm congressional elections as a referendum on the major legislation of President Barack Obama’s first two years—particularly health care reform.
In their study, Professor of Health Policy and Political Analysis Robert J. Blendon and Research Scientist John M. Benson found that 16 percent of Democratic voters wished to repeal and replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in contrast to 71 percent of Republicans.
Similarly, the pair found that 72 percent of Republicans were less likely to vote for a candidate due to his or her vote for the legislation, while 67 percent of Democrats were more likely to cast a ballot for an individual for that reason.
Republicans and Democrats have starkly different conceptions of what makes for good health reform: Democrats favor governmental approaches and Republicans favor private sector approaches, according to Benson.
“Democrats’ view of what health care should look like in the next Congress is 1,000 miles apart from the Republicans’ view of what it should look like,” Blendon said.
The study indicates that Republican voters believed that the bill would harm the economy—and given that the economy is a hot-button issue in this election, the health care debate has become even more important.
A total repeal of the health care bill seems unlikely, according to Benson. The researchers point out that even if the Republicans win both the House of Representatives and the Senate, they will be unable to muster enough votes to override a presidential veto. Benson said that Republicans are more likely to defund unpopular sections of the bill.
“On many of these issues, the center has disappeared,” Blendon said. The United States goes through cycles of polarization, he said, but the current political climate is one of the most divided he has seen in his career. Meanwhile, the respective political landscapes of the Democratic and Republican parties have grown increasingly homogenous.
The PPACA includes various provisions such as subsidizing health care, mandating health insurance, establishing health insurance exchanges, and extending coverage for children and young adults.
The HSPH researchers’ article was published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week.

Two Harvard affiliates were robbed at knifepoint Monday night, with one victim receiving stab wounds to the arm, the Cambridge Police reported yesterday.
The two incidents occurred just six minutes apart shortly after 11 p.m. on Monday in the vicinity of Kirkland and Irving Streets and Harvard Divinity School.
According to yesterday’s Cambridge Police advisory, which was distributed to the Harvard community via e-mail, both victims described the suspects as African-American males, one “very heavy set and the other as tall and thin.” That description matches those given in a series of four street robberies at knifepoint near MIT last week.
In the second of the two incidents on Monday, the victim resisted handing over his property after asked by the suspect.
“When the victim refused, the tall male stabbed the victim in the upper arm while the heavy suspect assaulted him.  The suspects took a cell phone, wallet and cash from the victim and fled the area,” the advisory stated.
The recent string of robberies has caused the police to reiterate that victims should not resist in such a situation—a point that yesterday’s e-mail emphasized in all-caps.
Four local police departments, including those of Harvard and MIT, are “deploy[ing] extra resources” in an effort to apprehend the suspects, Cambridge police said.

Harvard students looking for support can now turn to HarvardSmiles.com, an online hub launched last week to direct students to mental health resources on campus.
Spearheaded by the Student Mental Health Liaisons—undergraduates who work with Wellness Tutors on campus to reach out to students seeking help—Harvard Smiles features information about mental health and sexual assault as well as a calendar of mental health events. The web portal also provides links to academic and personal counseling resources.
Students can add comments and submit posts anonymously. Content from this past week ranges from a handwritten note on ways to reduce stress to a Stephen Colbert video on laughter.
“Fundamentally, it’s set up as a blog concept,” said Seth A. Riddley ’12, a mental health liaison who developed the website. “We’d like to make that an active part of the website to keep the website alive and to provide an area where students and others can support one another in mental health.”
The Student Mental Health Liaisons, founded in 2008 by University Health Services Department of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling, strives to raise awareness of mental health issues and provide peers with support and resources in their dorms.
According to Riddley, students tend to turn to their peers first in times of need.
“Having students involved in mental health on campus is important in enhancing the resources we have on campus,” he said.
Personal experiences with mental health have encouraged many to get involved in this effort, Riddley said.
“Having challenges myself and having friends going through challenges in mental health, I was really glad to find SMHL on campus,” he said.
The greatest factors contributing to mental health illness, which can interfere with academics and social life, include stress, sleep deprivation, and relationship trouble, according to Paul Barreira, UHS director of behavioral health and academic counseling, who advises the group.
“When students first come to campus from high school, they need to remember what helps them keep in balance,” Barreira said.

Your friends may be determined by whom you see, where you live, and what you do more so than race, Harvard and UCLA researchers say.
Using Facebook friend activity data, Harvard Sociology teaching fellow Kevin Lewis and UCLA Sociology Professor Andreas Wimmer studied how factors such as ethnicity, race, geographic proximity, and common interests affect the formation of friendships.
The findings, published Monday in the American Journal of Sociology, reveal that race plays a much more minor role in explaining the basis of friendships than previously thought.
“Just because people are friends and of the same race doesn’t mean that that’s why they are friends,” Lewis said.
The pair compiled a database of Facebook activity from about 740 college freshmen. By tracking friends “tagged” in Facebook photos and comparing listed interests and extracurricular activities, the researchers were able to find associations among students.
In deciding how to measure friendship, Lewis said that looking at friend requests was not a sufficient method.
“We weren’t satisfied with just Facebook friendships because there was little meaning,” he said.
By tracking which friends were tagged in photo albums, they were able to more accurately identify friendships “as they occur outside of online interaction,” Wimmer said.
“Picture-posting is a stronger measurement of friendship. If you took a picture of someone, took the time to tag the picture, you probably have a stronger relationship with them because it is inferred that you were spending time with one another,” Lewis said.
The researchers also analyzed personal information, listed interests, and similar social characteristics displayed on Facebook profile pages.
The study also revealed that roommates, former classmates, and people of similar ethnic backgrounds were most likely to bond.
Roommates were seven times more likely to form friendships. Asian students were 31 percent more likely to form bonds with similar ethnic identities; Caucasians were 25 percent more likely; and African-Americans and Latinos twice as likely.
“There’s a misconception that people go out and seek out people who are like them,” Wimmer said. “But it’s not true—it’s the social and physical constraints.”
Lewis noted two unanticipated correlations in the data: students from Illinois and Dave Matthews Band fans in particular tended to befriend one another.
Wimmer added that the study’s findings are not limited to college students.

The new Doña Betsaida Gutiérrez Housing Cooperative that opened in Jamaica Plain on Saturday is the latest project made possible by the Harvard’s 20/20/2000 Housing Initiative.
The Housing Cooperative represents the latest phase of a $50 million affordable housing development at the Blessed Sacrament parish site.
The ribbon-cutting ceremony also celebrated the 20/20/2000 initiative’s first ten years, during which time it has helped build and renovate more than 4,350 affordable housing units in Boston and Cambridge.
“We are pleased to join with the leadership of both cities on the 20/20/2000 initiative, which has helped to finance nearly one out of every six units built in Cambridge and Boston and provided many local working families with homes,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release.
Established in 2000 and spearheaded by former Vice President for Government, Community and Public Affairs Paul S. Grogan, the program is a $20 million, 20-year, low-interest loan fund that assists the financing of affordable housing developments.
Harvard created the initiative to support a community response to the growing need for affordable housing following the end of rent control in the 1990s. As federal and state resources declined, housing costs increased dramatically in Boston and Cambridge.
The 20/20/2000 Housing Initiative responded to local efforts to increase the availability of affordable housing by establishing a $20 million fund that would be used to grant low interest loans to non-profit housing agencies, coupled with $1 million in direct grants to local agencies to explore innovative approaches to affordable housing development.
“The Harvard loan provided a critical investment at the right time and right price that helped sustain us at a very critical point in development,” said Philip Giffee, executive director of the Neighborhood of Affordable Housing.
Giffee said that the non-profit organization used Harvard’s 20/20/2000 resources to help build a 14-unit, first-time homebuyer development outside of East Boston. The development provided housing for 14 low-medium income families that never owned a house before.
“Low-interest loan money, when you are borrowing lots of money like we are, helps a lot.” Giffee said. “Although Harvard clearly has an international presence, we encourage Harvard’s on-the-ground connection to the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of Asian American Awareness Week, the Harvard South Asian Association hosted a presentation on Bollywood cinema last night to discuss the vast variety of films that encompass the Indian movie genre.
Richard S. Delacy, a preceptor in Urdu-Hindi who has worked in the Indian movie industry, gave an hour-long introduction to the Bollywood film industry. He discussed the perceptions and realities of Bollywood movies by using clips from popular films like “Sometimes Happiness, Sometimes Sadness” to demonstrate that some, but not all films, promote the Bollywood stereotypes.
“I wanted to show that there’s a variety of films being made in South Asia at the moment,” Delacy said. “It’s very hard to fit them into an overall understanding of particular formulaic mode of filmmaking.”
Riya Goyal ’12, the academic and political chair of the South Asian Association, said she organized the event as an opportunity for students to gain a greater understanding of Bollywood films in light of Asian American Awareness Week.
“The Bollywood industry is something people have heard of but don’t really understand,” Goyal said. “Through this event, you kind of learn what the perceptions versus realities in Bollywood movies are.”
Anuv Ratan ’14 said the presentation offered him a new perspective on Indian films. Having watched most Bollywood films with his family, Ratan said he decided to attend the presentation to learn about a different side of the industry.
“I thought it was really cool analyzing [Bollywood] from a different viewpoint, seeing what other people think about it, not just for entertainment value, but also representing...symbolic aspects of Indian culture,” he said.
The South Asian Association makes an effort to bring together students of all ethnicities, according to Co-President Punit N. Shah ’12, who is also a Crimson blog editor.
“There is some universality in stories that allow people, no matter what culture or background, to come together and experience that story,” Shah said. “I think this is an interesting workshop to try to see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives yesterday but fell short of reclaiming the Senate, according to projections based on early returns, riding a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment to success at the polls.
Yesterday’s conservative resurgence affected both veteran and newly elected law-makers and reached across the country. But Republican success at the polls fell short of the “tsunami” that some had projected as Democrats retained key seats in Senate and gubernatorial races.
As The Crimson went to press, Republicans had gained 59 seats in the House, 20 more than the 39 necessary to gain control of the House.
On the heels of a deep economic recession, voters have grown broadly dissatisfied with the Barack Obama administration and the Democrat-controlled Congress. That disaffection was prominently on display last night as voters consistently chose to pull the lever on behalf of challengers.
The influence of the Tea Party, the populist right-wing movement, made its presence most clearly felt in Kentucky, Florida, and South Carolina where conservatives unseated more moderate candidates. In Kentucky, Republican Rand Paul, a darling of the Tea Party, captured a decisive victory. In Florida, Republican Marco Rubio unseated former Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who ran as an independent.
One of the Senate’s most liberal members, Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, lost to Republican challenger, Ron Johnson, last night. Meanwhile in South Carolina, Nikki Haley, an anti-establishment Tea Party candidate, triumphed in the gubernatorial race.
While the Tea Party delivered the votes necessary to assure victory for some of its favored candidates, its ability to deliver votes did not quite live up to the most hopeful pre-election estimates.
“I think it’s been overstated,” said Richard Parker, a Kennedy School lecturer. “Overstatement of an insurgent movement is a characteristic of the American press.”
In California, Democratic candidates fought off self-funded challengers from the right who poured money into the race. Jerry Brown defeated Meg Whitman to become the next governor. Incumbent Barbara Boxer defeated her challenger, Carly Fiorina, as well, according to early results.
If the Republicans sought to win the Senate, the night did not get off to the right start for GOP hopefuls as early returns on the East Coast did not lay the groundwork necessary for a Republican take-over of the Senate.
In Delaware, Republican Christine O’Donnell was unable to make inroads among moderate voters, many of whom viewed her as a right-wing extremist, and lost resoundingly to Democrat Chris Coons.
With the help of Democrats in Congress, Obama has pushed through a series of sweeping legislative projects—including health-care reform, a financial reform bill, and a massive stimulus bill—during his first two years in office. But many of those measures have grown unpopular with the electorate, and that sense of disillusion manifested in yesterday’s mid-term elections.
“There’s no question that midterm elections in a president’s first term are in many respects a referendum on his presidency, and the fact that he campaigned as extensively as he did meant that voters would interpret it as a referendum on his presidency,” said Kennedy School Professor and presidential scholar Roger B. Porter.
During the past year, the Tea Party  has capitalized on wide-spread dissatisfaction and fear of strong federal social policy to foment anger against incumbent Democrats.
“Do we wish to live free or be enslaved by debt? Do we believe in the individual or do we believe in the state?” said Paul, the victorious Kentucky Republican, in remarks that expressed some of the underlying currents of the Tea Party movement. “America can surmount these problems if we just get government out of the way.”
The Tea Party, which styles itself as a grass-roots organization, has mobilized conservative activists against incumbent Democrats and helped foment the anti-establishment narrative that has dominated media accounts of the election.
“When people are angry about the economy, they turn out the people in power,” said Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, a local politician and former Boston city councillor. “That’s what’s happening. It doesn’t mean they’re going to do anything magical, but now the Republicans own it. Good luck to them.”
As The Crimson went to press, the Republican party had gained control of the House but it remained unclear exactly how many seats they would claim from Democrats. It seemed unlikely they would reclaim control of the Senate.
Regardless of the magnitude of the Republican’s gains, the election will have serious consequences on Obama’s legislative ambitions.
“Whether the Republicans pick up 45 or 55 seats, the Democratic domestic agenda is pretty much dead for the next two years,” said Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer David King. “President Obama will have to focus on world politics—China on Russia and other areas where Congress won’t have as much say.”
With a Republican majority in the House, Obama will have no choice but to trim his sails to the prevailing political winds, according to Porter. But, he added, the extent to which Obama will be able to work with Republican leaders will depend on two things: the state of the economy when Congress reconvenes and what type of working relationship he is able to establish with Congressional leaders.
With yesterday’s voting, Republicans have gained control of the House but it remains unclear whether newly elected Republicans will be able to work well with the Republican establishment or whether internal divisions will lead to a lack of party unity.
“The big question mark moving forwards is whether or not the Tea Party and the Republican party establishment will be able to coalesce around a set of issues and desired outcomes that are consistent with where they are coming from,” said Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, a Kennedy School adjunct lecturer and director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy.

Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 won reelection on Tuesday night, although many of his fellow Democrats were unseated across the nation.
Patrick had garnered 49 percent of the vote, handily defeating Republican challenger Charles D. Baker ’79, who received 42 percent of the vote, with 96 percent of precincts reporting. The remaining votes went to Independent candidate Timothy P. Cahill and Green-Rainbow Party candidate Jill E. Stein ’73.
In general, Patrick took the major metropolitan districts of the state, while Baker proved popular in rural areas.
Patrick won Cambridge with 82.1 percent of the vote, according to Cambridge Election Commission Volunteer Daniel A. Schockett. In Cambridge, 54 percent of registered voters cast ballots in Tuesday’s midterm election.
The incumbent governor also carried Boston, garnering 70 percent of the vote.
Former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, who said he continues to follow local politics closely, attributed Baker’s loss to his attacks on Cahill.
“He lost some time and money doing so,” DiCara said. “He should’ve ignored Cahill. Attacking him strengthened Cahill’s resolve to stay in the race.”
DiCara said that Cahill ultimately attracted some of the “angry voters” that would have gone for Baker.
Patrick’s victory was a hard-fought one, with pundits predicting earlier this week that he would win yesterday’s election by a margin of just a few points.
“If I’d listened to pundits and pollsters four years ago, I wouldn’t be in this job,” Patrick said in an interview with The Crimson two weeks ago.
Patrick’s top priorities for 2011 are to create jobs, reduce health care costs, reform education, and address youth violence, he told the Boston Globe earlier this week.
“I believe in leadership that is about asking people to turn to each other and not on each other. And I see in my opposition exactly the opposite,” Patrick told The Crimson.
According to his campaign, during his first term, Patrick facilitated the creation of 60,000 local jobs and implemented a series of education reforms that made it easier to shut down failing schools and increased access to charter schools in poorly performing districts.
“The second term is about finishing that work,” Patrick told The Crimson. “It’s about finishing what we started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The shake-up in Washington yesterday has made waves that will soon make their way to Cambridge.
The Republican Party’s gains in the House and Senate will have significant effects on the status of issues like the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy and the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act—policies that deeply concern Harvard.
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for communications and public affairs, echoes the idea that the results of the midterm elections will have great influence on these policies.
“If there is a leadership change, then agendas can shift dramatically,” he says.
ROTC ON CAMPUS
University President Drew G. Faust says that Reserve Officer Training Corps’ return to campus is predicated on the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, but with yesterday’s conservative gains in Congress, that seems to be an unlikely outcome.
Harvard currently does not officially recognize ROTC because Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell violates the school’s anti-discrimination policy.
Recently, Massachusetts Senator Scott P. Brown publicly blasted Faust for the University’s policy on ROTC.
While Faust says she looks forward to a repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, Harvard’s position is unlikely to carry weight in Washington, according to Nathaniel G. Butler ’68, a Navy veteran and board member of the Harvard Gay and Lesbian Caucus.
The House of Representatives already passed a version of an appropriations bill that would repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. If the Senate makes any changes to the bill, then the House will be required to pass the bill again.
But Arizona Senator and former Republican presidential nominee John McCain says that he would lead a filibuster in the Senate to prevent the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. Although the Democrats held on to a majority in the Senate, they do not have the 60 votes required to break a filibuster.
“Ultimately these members of Congress will look like they supported discrimination,” says Robert Greenwald, managing director of the Law School’s Legal Services Center. “Time and history will show that the right thing to do is repeal Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
If the law is not repealed in Congress, it can be decided on in the court system. According to Law School professor Michael J. Klarman, the law is based on prejudice against LGBT people and “that’s not a sufficient justification for sustaining a law under well-established constitutional doctrine.”
According to Greenwald, the election of a more conservative House yesterday reflects the country’s views on economic policy, rather than its opinion on Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.
The majority of people in the United States support the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, but the fiscal mood of the country pushed voters to chose more conservative candidates, according to Greenwald.
Butler—who says he was forced to lie about his sexual orientation when he served in the navy—says that if Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is eventually repealed, Harvard would reinstate ROTC immediately. Harvard students can currently participate in MIT’s ROTC program.
I HAVE A DREAM
Yesterday’s election results play a key role in determining the outcome of the DREAM Act that Harvard has consistently lobbied for over the past few years.
If passed, the DREAM Act would provide qualified undocumented youth with a six-year-long conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
On Sept. 14, Nevada Senator Harry M. Reid announced that the proposed DREAM Act will be amended to military legislation that was scheduled for vote on the Senate floor the following week. However, on Sept. 21, the legislation failed to see a final vote in the Senate due to a Republican filibuster.
Despite the setback, Harvard College Act on a Dream Co-Director Nicolas E. Jofre ’13 is hopeful that Reid will bring back the proposed legislation during the lame duck session after this election—a promise Reid has made on television. If reintroduced during the lame duck session, the DREAM Act would stand alone.
“In theory, we did have the numbers if the politics of it hadn’t been so controversial,” says Jofre about the filibuster in September, adding that the change in the make-up of the Senate complicates the DREAM Act’s chances.
“We would have to see how leadership is formed in post-election congress,” Casey says.
Jofre says he hopes that the favorable attention the DREAM Act garnered during campaign season will help convince Republicans to vote favorably during the lame duck session.
“I think it is critical to have the Dream Act passed; and focus as well on the Southern border,” writes Deborah E. Anker, a Law School professor who specializes in immigration issues, in an e-mail.
In May 2009, Faust wrote a letter in support of the legislation to Massachusetts Representative Michael E. Capuano. Faust also met with Massachusetts Senator Scott P. Brown, in part to urge him to support the DREAM Act.
To show their support for the DREAM Act, eight leaders of institutions of higher education in Massachusetts—including Faust—co-signed a letter sent to the state Senators in September.
Brown, who has remained ambivalent on his position in relation to the legislation, voted against the defense resolution and the appended DREAM Act on Sept. 21.
“We’re hopeful that regardless of party control, sometime soon, that in the complicated area of immigration reform, the one area that there may be bipartisan agreement on is the DREAM Act,” Casey says.

Harvard University has retained its “triple-A” credit rating—the highest possible—from two major rating agencies as it prepares to issue about $1 billion in new bonds next week. The favorable rating allows Harvard to borrow at low interest rates.
The two new bond issues of $730 million and $300 million—a net increase of about $300 million—will bring the University’s total outstanding debt to $6.6 billion, which is more than double the amount outstanding in 2006.
According to Moody’s Investor Service, the University’s liquidity situation—which affects its ability to repay creditors—has improved since the endowment’s precipitous drop in 2009 as Harvard’s money managers have said they have become more cognizant of the University’s need for cash.
“We believe the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the endowment’s investment management, and the University have become increasingly integrated in assessing organizational liquidity needs,” the Moody’s report stated.
It added that in fiscal year 2010, the University reported $9 billion in unrestricted cash and investments that could be liquidated within one month’s time.
Harvard’s new debt would be used to support the ongoing renovation of the Fogg Museum as well as refinance existing debt obligations, according to Moody’s.
But both Moody’s and Standard & Poors, another rating agency, emphasized that the University intends to lessen its capital spending this year and next.
As early as 2009, University President Drew G. Faust announced Harvard’s intention to cut as much as half of its capital budget in future years.
In contrast to its strategy for the past decade, when much of Harvard’s new construction was financed primarily by borrowing, the University is now focusing on obtaining private donations to finance building projects, such as the Fogg renovation, which will be supported by donor contributions as well as the bond sale.
A new Harvard Business School building in Allston announced last month will be financed by a $50 million gift from Indian billionaire Ratan N. Tata.
Additionally, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp is implementing a new capital planning process to further centralize decisions about how financial resources are best utilized.

Firesheep, a free plugin whose name is reminiscent of its host application Firefox, has generated considerable debate since its release on Oct. 24, potentially posing a privacy threat to Harvard’s users of social websites.
The approximately 200,000 users worldwide who have downloaded the program can “side-jack” accounts and thus view anyone’s private information on Facebook, Twitter, and other social sites. Hackers can then read private messages and even post status updates without knowing the password to the hacked account.
In response, FAS IT issued a cautionary email last Friday, informing the Harvard community of the privacy threats posed by Firesheep and outlining steps to remedy the issue.
One such step recommended by FAS IT is to access the Harvard network using Virtual Private Networking (VPN) connection, which encrypts all traffic from a computer over the wireless network, ensuring the security of the information.
The only way users on wireless Harvard networks can be vulnerable to individuals using Firesheep is if both users had the same access point—for example, if they lived in the same House, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Senior Client Technology Advisor Noah S. Selsby ’94.
A week after Firesheep’s initial release, Eric Butler, the program’s designer, defended the legality and ethics of the plugin in a blog post, writing that the notion of Firesheep as a tool for “harassing or attacking people” is “completely false,” given that some users are hacking the accounts of their consenting friends as a test of a given website’s security.
He added that he does not think “Firesheep turns otherwise innocent people evil,” since people make the distinct choice to use the program maliciously and without permission.
Matthew J. Chartier ’12, a teaching fellow for CS50, echoed similar sentiments. He said that he thinks Firesheep is not offered “maliciously, but to demonstrate user vulnerability to the mainstream,” since other hacking programs that are more difficult to use have existed for at least five years.
CS50 students discussed this vulnerability in “a really valuable, if scary, conversation” in class last week when the teaching staff demonstrated how accessing Facebook over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks left users vulnerable to potential “session-hijacking attacks,” according to course instructor David J. Malan ’99.
In light of this vulnerability, FireShepard, a program designed to “herd” the hacker program, was released by University of Iceland engineering student Gunnar Atli Sigurdsson a few days after Firesheep’s release. This program releases a string of junk characters which, when read by Firesheep, will allegedly cause the plugin to crash over the local wireless network.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the election results filtered in last night, a wide array of emotions were on display at campus watch parties held by the Harvard Republican Club, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Institute of Politics.
As students watched the House of Representatives map turn from blue to red, Republicans grew elated as Democrats became subdued.
In a conference room off of the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the IOP, the Republican Club popped open Martinelli’s sparkling apple cider when unexpected early Republican victories were announced.
Rachel L. Wagley ’11, the HRC vice-president of campaigns and activism, made no attempt to hide her enthusiasm, wearing a red jacket, red shoes, a pin that said “Kill the Death Tax, don’t wound it”, and a National Rifle Association baseball cap.
“I’m ecstatic,” she said. “We just fired Nancy Pelosi. It doesn’t get better than that.”
Other Republicans were equally excited, though slightly more reserved.
“I’m thrilled with the House results,” said Kevin R. Palmer ’13, who arrived at 6:30 p.m. to start watching results. “It’s too early to tell but we picked up some seats we weren’t expecting to pick up.”
Despite the excitement of winning majorities in the House, the members of HRC were not as confident about the Senate results.
“Things are looking up in the Senate,” Antoine Martinho III ’13 said. “We don’t know if we’ll pull a majority, but we’d like to even things up a bit.”
Outside the conference room, a gathering of mostly Harvard Kennedy School students in the JFK Forum had a more scholarly air. Students said that they attended this particular watch party instead of a partisan event because they wanted to have discussion about the results, instead of simply celebrating.
“There have been good, heated discussions,” said Alexander Y. McCue ’14, who campaigned with the Democrats. “If you have both parties present, it keeps you in check.”
Some Kennedy School students even participated in a contest to predict the winners of certain races.
Outside the confines of the IOP, there was less elation over pizza at the Democrats watch party in Currier House, according to Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, president of the Harvard College Democrats.
“There is slight disappointment, but I’m not saying that was beyond our expectations,” he said. “We had the sense that we would lose the House and keep the Senate, and it looks like that is going to be the case.”
Over the course of the campaign, the Democrats knocked on just under 10,000 doors, which is in itself a feat, especially during a midterm election, Berkenfeld said.
“Win or lose, we had always defined success as waking up on the morning of November 3 feeling as though we had done everything we could to put Dems in a position to succeed,” Berkenfeld said, “That is undeniably a benchmark that we met tonight.”
Back at the Republican camp, the party went on. As John McCain won the Senate Race in Arizona, Wagley screamed in elation. “Whooo!” she said. “John McCain finally won—two years later.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lauren A. Williams ’14 remembered her first “positive no” while campaigning for defeated Connecticut Senate candidate Linda McMahon.
“I’m never going to vote for Linda McMahon,” said the woman opening the door. But although she didn’t share their Republican views, she still offered to take Williams and her canvassing partner to her next-door neighbor’s house because she was impressed that the pair was “doing their civic duty.”
In preparation for the midterm elections, Harvard students from both sides of the political spectrum spent weeks hitting the streets and manning the phones in support of both candidates and specific issues.
“A CAMPAIGN ORGANIZATION”
On Saturday morning, a group of about 30 students huddled outside Johnston Gate at 10 a.m., drinking coffee and eating pastries while they waited to get on a yellow school bus that would drive them to New Hampshire.
After Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 and Campaigns Director Evelyn R. Wenger ’11 successfully corralled everyone onto the bus, Berkenfeld gave a quick pep talk about the necessity of grassroots canvassing.
Every weekend about 25 to 30 volunteers devoted their Saturdays to campaigning, according to Berkenfeld: “The Harvard College Democrats are really a campaign organization, and we are at our finest when we are devoting our efforts to campaigning specifically,” Berkenfeld said.
About an hour later, about 15 minutes from campaign headquarters, Wenger stood up to explain the views of the candidates for whom the group was canvassing—defeated Paul Hodes for Senate, defeated Carol Shea-Porter for Congress, and reelected John Lynch for governor—and the importance of the races.
After getting off the bus, the group separated into pairs and headed to campaign headquarters for training and route assignments. At 1 p.m., Allison Gofman ’14 and Gary D. J. Gerbrandt ’14, maps and flyers in hand, were ready to canvass.
The campaign had given the pair a lists of houses to go to, where they woul talk to voters and remind them to vote on Tuesday. These lists also included voting records, so Gofman and Gerbrandt knew how many times each voter had voted in the past three elections.
Early on in their campaigning, Gofman and Gerbrandt received a positive reception from a voter who had voted in all three of the past elections. “Tell your friends to vote,” Gofman reminded her.
“I’ll tell my friends to vote,” the woman said. “Well, most of them. The Republicans, I’ll tell to stay home.”
If the voter was not home and had voted three out of three times or zero out of three times, Gofman and Gerbrandt were supposed to mark “NH”—meaning “not home”—on their sheet and continue. The voters who had not voted in the past elections would be visited and called again by the campaign to ensure that they would vote.
If the voter was not home and had only voted once or twice in the past three elections, Gofman and Gerbrandt left campaign brochures, marked “NH” on their sheet, and continued.
During his multiple trips to Manchester and his one trip to Exeter, N.H., Gerbrandt gained a lot of experience about where to leave pamphlets—never in mailboxes because it is a federal offense—and learned that canvassing during a Patriots game is rarely successful.
Gerbrandt, a native of Canada, said he became involved with the Harvard Democrats because he was interested in progressive causes, despite the fact that he could not vote in the United States. “It also seemed like the logical thing to do, especially during a midterm election,” he said.
A few hours later, after Gofman and Gerbrandt had visited the 65 houses on their list, the campaign driver returned them to campaign headquarters, where they left telephone messages for the voters who were not home.
When the Harvard group piled onto the bus around 4:30 p.m., not all of the 35 volunteers were present. About five, including Berkenfeld and Wenger, stayed to sleep on floors and couches in supporters’ houses and continued canvassing and phonebanking for the next few days.
Reluctantly, Gerbrandt got on the bus back to Harvard to work on his Expos paper. His time in Cambridge was brief—the next morning, he was back on the bus to Manchester.
A CLUB, AND PARTY, REENERGIZED
There’s an increased level of engagement and energy in the Harvard Republican Club this year, according to Kevin R. Palmer ’13, the club’s vice president for social events.
While the group’s membership levels haven’t increased—hovering at around 79 dues-paid members—“there’s more energy,” Palmer said.
With the Republicans likely to take back a number of seats in the election, the club had a core group of members who spent the political season campaigning to make this happen in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.
Palmer remembered one particular house in Connecticut he visited while canvassing for McMahon with the club. The voter opened the door while on the phone and was clearly displeased to find solicitors—but his demeanor changed once he saw their Linda McMahon pins. “Hey, I’m going to have to call you back. They’re with Linda,” he told the person on the line, and proceeded to talk with Palmer about McMahon.
The increased support for Republicans this election season, said HRC President Mark A. Isaacson ’11, is partially a result of voters’ top two issues this election: the economy and jobs.
“No one even had to think about it,” he said. “You can really sense the voter’s dissatisfaction with government and politics broadly.”
Though they have spent a few days campaigning for McMahon in Connecticut and senator-elect Kelly Ayotte and Congressman-elect Frank Guinta in New Hampshire, the majority of the Republicans’ efforts were in state.
The group had been canvassing and phonebanking for defeated Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Charles D. Baker ’79 regularly. Ten to 15 people headed to Baker’s campaign headquarters every other Thursday night to phonebank, and four club members interned for Baker. Outside of the club, there were a handful of other Harvard students also interning for Baker, said Rachel L. Wagley ’11, HRC vice-president of campaigns and activism.
The group considered going to New Hampshire again last week but ultimately decided to stay in Massachusetts and campaigned for local races. “New Hampshire is in the bag for us,” Wagley said.
CAMPAIGNING CLOSER TO HOME
Aside from the standard campaigning by the HRC and the Dems, another collection of students emerged in opposition to an issue on the Massachusetts ballot this election.
Students involved with the successful “Vote No on 2” Campaign spent the past few weeks working to convince Massachusetts voters not to pass Massachusetts State Ballot Question 2, an initiative that would repeal the state’s Affordable Housing Law. Voters followed the student’s advice and voted no.
“For me, I feel like it might be an imperfect law, but it has done a lot and we shouldn’t just throw it out without having something else to offer,” said second-semester junior Lucy Claire Curran, who was involved with the campaign.
Maya S. Sugarman ’12 said she felt especially drawn to the campaign given the strong impact that homelessness had on her family. She remembered driving around with her mother as a young girl, in search of her homeless uncle. Whenever the pair spotted a homeless individual, Sugarman’s mother would say, “Maybe that’s him.”
“But it never was,” Sugarman said. The experience taught her that anyone can fall on hard times and that “everybody deserves a safe, comfortable place to live,” she said.
The “Vote No on 2” Campaign primarily worked to draw attention to the initiative. One of the main problems, Sugarman said, is that voters were not well-informed about the different ballot initiatives. Although this was a state-wide issue, the Harvard branch of the campaign stayed mainly in Boston.
“It is hard to build that excitement and urgency on campus,” Sugarman said, noting that the campaign primarily handed out flyers and held signs by T stops, grocery stores, and other places frequented by locals.
Curran said she enjoyed the experience of campaigning to block the initiative.
“It was democracy at work,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Until coming in as a substitute on Saturday against Dartmouth, field hockey captain KJ Warren hadn’t played in a game since the Bush Administration.
Her last appearance came on Nov. 8, 2008, four days after Obama was elected president.
Warren, who played in 16 of the team’s 17 games that year, has been plagued by injury for the last two seasons. According to senior forward Chloe Keating, Warren underwent extensive surgery around her knee at the beginning of her junior year. Warren faced a number of setbacks, the most serious was a second surgery last March.
Even with an injury, the senior was still named co-captain this year.
“Most of my experience with KJ was her helping everyone get through the hard practices [and] helping the team realize what’s important, what things need to get done, [and] how to hold each other accountable on and off the field,” says sophomore Kim Goh, who until last Saturday had never seen Warren in action.
Warren, one of just three seniors on the team, actively had a role in leading the team this year. Despite not being able to play, she has travelled with the team throughout the course of her stint off the field.
As an underclassman, she was given relatively limited playing time, starting just seven games in the two-season stretch.
But as the captain, Warren has been an integral part of maintaining the team’s cohesion even though the team has been hit with a number of injuries and has struggled on the field this year.
“Injuries have been an issue for our team in general, and [it’s nice] having a captain who could really show that you are definitely more to the team than what you bring with a stick in your hand. You bring your whole self to the team everyday—that’s her philosophy and what she taught all of us,” Goh says.
Throughout the season, it wasn’t ever clear when—or if—Warren would be able to return. Her recovery is hardly complete, and last weekend’s appearance limited the field hockey captain to just 11 minutes of play in the second-to-last game of her college career.
“I think everyone on the team was just so excited to have her back, and everyone had watched her recovery and her resilience through the last two years, so it was nice see some of that materialize into actually playing the game on Saturday,” Keating says. “I think the whole group was just really uplifted by her coming back.”
Warren has been able to stay active in team leadership partly because of the team’s youth.  Fourteen of the team’s 20 players are underclassmen—including eight freshmen—and the team has grown from its 16-player roster last year.
“[She’s] a teammate you look up to for so long as a leader and a team player, and to actually get to experience it on the field, everything sort of falls into place,” Goh says. “You can see the fruits of all of that energy and all of that spirit come into play as a competitor, and that’s something really special.”
This Saturday’s game, at home against Columbia, is the season’s final game. Warren last played a home game 728 days ago.
While an Ivy title may be out of reach for the Harvard field hockey team, the Crimson co-captain will get one more chance to play at Jordan Field before graduating.
“This entire year, whether or not she would get back was up in the air,” Keating says. “It was nice to see her get out there, at least for a little.”
Goh echoed the same sentiment.
“She has been in rehab for years, and has had a number of injuries [and] several surgeries, but despite not playing for an entire season plus, she never questioned that she needed to do everything in her power to get better,” Goh says. “Ultimately, I’m thrilled that it’s paid off for her to be able to play in these last two games.”
“It speaks to her incredible optimism and commitment to the team that she was willing to put in every ounce of effort that she could to get physically better,” she adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore Alex Fallstrom found himself in quite the conundrum on Monday night. While suiting up for Harvard’s exhibition game against the U-18 national team of his native Sweden, he couldn’t help but think what it would be like to play against his old friends and countrymen. Luckily, he didn’t have to wait too long.
“It was fun,” Fallstrom says of the game. “A couple of my good friends from home are on that team.”
Fallstrom and the Crimson ended up falling, 2-1, in that matchup.
The 6-foot-2 forward was born in Stockholm and knows many players on the Swedish team from his time playing for his native club team Djurgarden Hockey as well as several stints with the U-18 national team.
“I actually played with the national team last year,” Fallstrom says. “[We] came to Canada for three exhibitions games as part of tryouts for World Juniors. I’ve played against most of the players, and I know five or six of them personally.”
Fallstrom performed well against his countrymen, assisting junior forward Ryan Grimshaw for Harvard’s only goal. The play of his fellow teammates has Fallstrom looking forward to the rest of the year.
“I think we showed that we’ve made a lot of progress during the preseason,” Fallstrom says. “We were the better team throughout the game. We came back really strong in the third period. All that was missing was a couple goals.”
These are goals the sophomore will look to provide for the Crimson this year, especially after the loss of classmate Louis Leblanc to the NHL.
“Louis was our leading scorer, so of course it’s a big loss,” Fallstrom says. “I don’t think it will have an impact on the way we perform this year. It just means there will be more responsibility for the players on the team. A lot more players, like myself, will have to produce more points.”
Fallstrom certainly looks poised to make a splash this year. He skated in all but one of Harvard’s 33 games last season, scoring four goals and notching eight assists.
“Everyone is looking for Fallstrom to have a great year,” junior forward Alex Killorn says. “Over the past year, he’s matured a lot hockey-wise. We expect a lot of him offensively, and I think he’ll do much to contribute.”
In the exhibition game, Fallstrom relished the chance to compete against his good friends. One of them, Gabreil Landeskog, had a nice day as well, assisting on a Swedish goal.
“We played on the same juniors team back home, and we’ve been to several national team camps together,” Fallstrom says. “That’s how we built our friendship. He’s playing in the OHL (Ontario Hockey league). He made the decision to go across the pond. It was great to see him.”
Fallstrom’s desire for a top education and the option to go pro prompted him to come to the U.S. at the age of 16 and attend school in Minnesota. He feels that being at Harvard gives him the best chance to pursue both goals.
“I always wanted to play hockey in the States, and school has always been really important for me,” Fallstrom says. “I wanted to go to the NHL draft. I knew the transition from Swedish school to college would be tough. I had an opportunity to go to school in Minnesota and thought that would be a great way to prepare for college.”
The Minnesota Wild drafted Fallstrom in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft and then traded his rights to the Boston Bruins. Fallstrom wishes to one day play for a team in the NHL, an aspiration he makes very clear.
“My ultimate goal is to go pro,” Fallstrom says. “That’s my biggest goal. I feel like going here and playing for Harvard is something that can really help me reach that goal.”
Although the prospect of beating his good friends enticed Fallstrom, he insisted that Monday’s contest was simply business as usual.
“Of course, going into the game, there was a little more excitement,” he says. “But once the puck dropped, it was like any other game. It didn’t have any effect on my play.”
The forward also wasn’t worried that the events of the game would change the relationships he forged as a young kid. Unfortunately, the Crimson could not live up to the bluster Fallstrom jokingly portrayed to his old friends before the game.
“There was a little trash talk, but they’re my good friends, so I knew there weren’t going to be any hard feelings. What happens on the ice stays on the ice,” Fallstrom says.
With this exhibition behind Harvard, Fallstrom looks forward to the rest of the year with an optimistic and excited outlook.
“The goals we set for ourselves are really clear,” Fallstrom says. “We obviously worked hard all summer and all preseason. We’ve had two good preseason games, so we’re ready for the season to get going here.”
Hopefully the sophomore can help propel the Crimson to a successful season this year—and defeat a few friends along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a soccer player from Pleasant Garden, N.C., I never felt much of a connection to ice hockey. The sport was something I saw as a Canadian thing, a Minnesota thing, and, after watching my own Carolina Hurricanes play, a lose-your-teeth, get-slammed-into-a-wall thing. Needless to say, I stuck with sports that kept to the grass and away from the skates.
Sports writing at Harvard was a game changer.
Those early and rather ill-informed perceptions lost their credibility when I watched Crimson hockey for the first time; it opened my eyes to a sport that combined grit and grace, hard hitting and finesse.
When I ventured to Bright Hockey Center last year as the neophyte beat writer for the hockey team, I immediately hated the cold and alienating feel of the rink, the loud sound made when puck connected with stick, and the juxtaposition between the sports with which I was familiar and the one which I was presently facing.
My hatred was short-lived, however, as I quickly realized I was covering a sport that, yes, was unfamiliar, but that was absolutely exhilarating, that pulled you in and kept you on the edge of your seat from the starting whistle.
Unlike the frequent stops for substitutions, fouls, penalties, timeouts and play calling with football and basketball, hockey doesn’t give the watcher the chance to take a breath. It’s fast-paced and intense, with players jumping from the bench to the ice in one movement, taking hits that would put most people out of commission.
But they always get up in an instant, without thought of pain or hesitancy, hungry for the puck, hungry for a goal, and hungry to hit back.
I was hooked.
The players skated with a fluidity that seemed effortless, making it look easy. I found myself believing that I could go out onto the ice and glide with similar ease and comfort.
Of course, reality checked in and I remembered that I could hardly put one skate in skate of the other when I was in a rink; I more frequently ate ice than moved on it.
Before I knew it, I learned about fore-checks and icing, the nature of penalties and power plays, and that losing one’s teeth did not actually happen on a regular basis.
Mostly, I learned that ice hockey excited passion in its fans, coaches, writers, and players in a way that was unique and powerful. The very things that had initially turned me off from the sport—the cold, the noise, the hefty equipment, and the ferocity—were all exercises of the passion inspired by it. I came to understand the sport not through its technicalities or rules, but by recognizing the aggression and the desire in each of the player’s eyes—a mark that distinguished an athlete from a mere mortal.
Like any Division I athlete, hockey players train year-round. Whether it’s during holidays or during the summer, they are practicing, lifting weights and building fitness, all the while proving their dedication and fostering their hunger for the game.
Although the hockey season has just begun, it has not yet failed to continue my growing admiration. Just in the last women’s game against Brown, I saw tri-captain Kate Buesser go crashing into the net in an attempt to score; that kind of commitment is impossible to deny and impossible not to admire.
Although I began as a soccer player, I have become not only a hockey writer, but also a hockey fan. Whereas I used to scoff, I now respect both the players and the sport. The sounds are still loud and the hits still hard, but instead of being unattractive and ominous, they have become the representation of skill, music to the ears of one who knows the passion behind each.
Grass may have been where I first came to love sports, but it is on ice where I now find myself transfixed by the turn of a blade and the swipe of a stick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of us were busy planning costumes for a weekend of Halloween mayhem, Francesca Den Hartog ’83 readied herself for a different sort of celebration. 
 
Last weekend, the former Harvard women’s lacrosse captain and two-time All-America honoree was inducted, along with seven other lacrosse greats, into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. 

 
According to Lacrosse Magazine, Den Hartog played in the inaugural competition of three major lacrosse events: the Massachusetts high school state championship, the women’s NCAA national tournament, and the women’s World Cup. She led the Crimson to three Ivy League titles and is thought to be the first women’s lacrosse player to use a stick with a plastic molded head. 
 
During Den Hartog’s time at Harvard, the Crimson went 20-3 in Ivy League play and earned a trip to the quarterfinals of the NCAA women’s lacrosse tournament. Den Hartog garnered first team All-Ivy honors after each of her four seasons at Harvard, including two nods as Ivy League Player of the Year. 
 
The former captain dominated the record book in the early 80’s for Harvard. Over the course of her career, Den Hartog tallied 249 goals and 315 points, good for all-time records in both of these categories.  She also holds the school records for goals in a single season and goals in a single game, with 83 and nine, respectively. Den Hartog currently claims the league record for most points scored in an Ivy League season with 46.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore wrestler Adam Hogue—known by friends and teammates alike as The Hoguey Bear—was welcomed to Harvard last fall by being assigned J.P. O’Connor ’10, 2010 NCAA national champion, as his practice partner. After spending hours on the mat with the aspiring-Olympian, Hogue tries to explain what makes the champ unstoppable. But that’s not all. In this exclusive interview, Hogue explains why he would make a good women’s volleyball player and why it’s not a good idea to eat too much before a wrestling match. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
 
Name: Adam Hogue
 
Year: 2013
 
Stats: Despite battling an ankle injury as a freshman last season, Hogue managed to finish fifth on the team in total wins, compiling a 7-6 record. At Blair Academy, the 165-pounder captured the 2009 Prep National Championship and was a three-time National Prep All-American.
 
Time for the inquisition!
 
1. Typical pre-game meal. 
 
After weigh-ins, I usually eat a cold bagel with cream cheese, a banana, and oatmeal with honey. I drink two Gatorades and a water. The whole filet mignon pregame meal isn't exactly readily available in a gym at 7am. 

 
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up. 
1. “I am Mine” by Pearl Jam
2. “Up, Up, and Away” by Kid Cudi
3. “Seven Nation Army” by The White Stripes 
4. “Party in the USA”.....don't judge 
 
3. Favorite team to play against and why. 
 
I would have to say Lehigh or Cornell. I have friends on both teams and both sets of fans are extremely intense. Also, both schools are within driving distance of my house, so I get to see my little brother and sister when we compete in Bethlehem or Ithaca. 
 
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room. 
 
I plead the Fifth. 
 
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the mat. 
Probably my senior year of high school, when I threw up a little bit in the middle of my first match of the day. I must have eaten a little too much after weigh-ins, and with about five seconds left in the first period it happened. My opponent gave a less than friendly, "Bro, did you just throw up on me?" That was a less than stellar match for me. I do not recommend having to get [vomit] cleaned off of you while wearing a singlet in the middle of a crowded gym. 
 
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why. 
It's funny, but my teammates call me The Hoguey Bear, and I would have to say a koala bear. Koalas are cute and cuddly until you attack them, then they are very aggressive and relentless. I would like to think that is how I am perceived off the mat and on the mat.
 
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in. 
My sophomore year in high school, my opponent's dad ran out of the stands and started yelling, "I'll killya! I'll killya!" as we went out of bounds near him. The match was in my home state of Ohio, and let me tell you, he was probably serious. They are crazy out there. 
 
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why? 
Probably women's volleyball. I'm an avid supporter, and I think the spandex uniform would make it a smooth transition. But seriously, baseball, I used to love playing in high school. 
 
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch. 
I think I would probably be the goalie. I'm pretty agile, but in dead sprints, I look like I have a refrigerator on my back. The less pure sprints, the better I am. Also, I have a pretty hard head. I think I could take a few shots off my dome and be okay. 
 
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
Being from Cleveland, I would have to take LeBron James to a dark alley somewhere. I need some closure, it's so hard to say goodbye. 
 
11. Key to defeating JP O’Connor (so I can get my revenge).
Off to discover the mythical key to defeating JP. I haven't found it yet. I swear he has opposable thumbs on his feet or something. He's unreal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They're going to the 'ship.
Classmates Esther Lofgren '07-'09 and Henrik Rummel '09 are bound for the Grand Finals for a chance to win the World Championships. The road to the finals was relatively painless for Lofgren, whose 8+ won its heat convincingly. Rummel, on the other hand, had to take a slightly longer route: after taking second in its heat, his four had to brave repechage to make it to the finals.
WOMEN'S 8+
Calendar Girls have the best times. Or so it seems after the heats in the women's 8+ at the Rowing World Championships in Lake Karapiro, New Zealand.
On Tuesday, the eight lived up to its calendar slogan "Power and Grace" in its first race at Worlds. The US led its heat at every 500-meter mark and finished the race with open water on second-place Great Britain.
The US women had the fastest time of the day in the event. The Canadian 8+, the winner of heat two, was over a second behind.
Five-seat Lofgren was a two time All-American at Radcliffe. She has been writing a blog on her national team experience.
For full results, check out the official results here. Lofgren, Laura Nicholson '09 and Laura Larsen-Strecker '08 are all featured in the "Power and Grace" catalog, the cover of which was row2k's Photo of the Day today.
MEN'S 4-
After failing to win heats in its opening race, the United States four without coxswain was faced with a do-or-die scenario: the squad needed to finish in the top two in order to make it to the A Finals. And Henrik Rummel '09 and co. passed with flying colors. The US 4- edged Italy by less than a second to win the repechage and earn a chance to compete for world championship gold. Its time, 6:15.59, stands as the fastest posted during reps.
Rummel's four was relegated to the Repechage after finishing second to New Zealand it its heat. The boat posted the fourth fastest time in the event. Rummel and the US will face New Zealand and Italy again in the Finals as well as crews from Great Britain, Greece, and France.

Did you dress up as a burrito this year for Halloween? Well, in the years past, you could’ve gotten a free burrito at Chipotle as part of their annual tradition. However, the promotion was discontinued this year.
"It cost us a fortune," Mark Crumpacker, Chipotle's chief marketing officer, told Advertising Age. "And it wasn't doing a whole heck of a lot for me from a marketing perspective."
The incentive was replaced by a $2 per burrito promotion, and proceeds were donated to benefit the Jamie Oliver Food Revolution.
Kim Randell, the manager of the Harvard Square Chipotle, was excited about the change in promotions: “Instead of just giving people free stuff, now it goes to a good cause.”
When asked if the lack of free burritos was a deterrent to customers, she said that the number of customers was as big as it was every year, and that supposedly customers were aware of this change.
And for the students who wanted truly free burritos on Halloween, Boloco did fill this void for customers who said “Trick or Treat” at the register.

In this series, we bring you creative and delicious recipes that can be made in 10 minutes and less, all within the constraints of Harvard’s dining halls. Have a recipe you'd like to share? E-mail us at flyby@thecrimson.com.
Today we bring you a healthy-ish entrée and less healthy dessert, but both are equally delicious! For a guiltless lunch, we’re presenting a tomato-mustard grilled cheese that you can make on your own, avoiding the grease of the grill. For dessert, we bring you a delectable cookie froyo sandwich. The grilled cheese is perfect for lunch and can be made using the panini press and just a few ingredients. The froyo sandwich is great for lunch or dinner, and has the perfect touch of sweet to finish off a meal.
TOMATO-MUSTARD GRILLED CHEESE
Ingredients:
2 slices of bread (white or whole wheat)
3 slices of cheese
4 tomato slices
mustard, to taste
Directions: Grab two slices of bread; pop them in the toaster until brown. Take out the bread, and spread mustard on one slice of bread, to taste. Put three slices of cheese on top of the mustard, and then add the four tomato pieces. Combine both pieces of bread into a sandwich, and use the Panini maker to melt your cheese for a delectable butter-free lunch.
COOKIE FROYO SANDWICH
Ingredients:
2 cookies (any flavor!)
froyo (chocolate or vanilla)
Directions: Grab two cookies from the dessert section and, on a plate, pop them into the microwave for a quick warming session. Make sure that one cookie is right side up and that the other is upside down. After 15 seconds, remove the cookies. They should be soft. Head over to the froyo area, and put either chocolate or vanilla froyo on the upside down cookie depending on your taste. Finish off your sandwich by putting the remaining cookie on top. There you have it – a delicious froyo sandwich.

In  this series, we chat with the freshmen who were lucky  enough to  land dorm rooms that once housed Harvard’s most famous  almuni.
Today, we’re looking at the Wigglesworth dorm room that was once occupied by Bill Gates and currently is the home to Luke E. Sundquist '14, Matthew D. Moellman '14, Andrew Wang '14, and Anthony A. Palillo '14. The suite is a mess; boxes and clothing crowd the floor and the sound of Halo from the television fills the room.
All of the roommates, except for Palillo who was unable to attend the interview, agree that they are the perfect students to be living in Gates’ old room. Sundquist prepared an unsolicited statement in which he wrote the following:
“So for me, it’s been motivating living in the same room as Bill Gates once did. I think I can speak for everyone when I say that we all dream of dropping out next year, just like he did. We treat our Xbox 360 like a shrine to Bill Gates, Microsoft, and all of the technological progress that he has made. We also play a lot of Halo Reach.”
Here are some excerpts from our conversation:
If Gates drops a thousand-dollar bill on the ground, he actually shouldn’t bother to pick it up; in the four seconds that the effort takes he would have made the money back. How long would you spend trying to pick up a thousand-dollar bill glued to the ground?
Wang: First of all, there are no thousand dollars bills…
Sundquist: I would probably spend 10 hours.
If Bill Gates were a country, he would be the 37th richest country on earth. If you could be any country, real or imagined, what country would you be and why?
Moellman: The United States. Obviously. Because we’re the best at everything, except for speed skating.
Wang: I mean why would you be anything other than the US?
Sundquist: Multi-nationalism.
Gates’ favorite game, according to his website, is bridge. What is the first word you think of when you hear the word bridge?
Moellman: Jumping. 
Sunquist: Newspaper.
Wang: Dictionary.
On a scale of 1-10, how jealous are your neighbors?
 
[Arjun A. Mody ’14, who has been listening to the entire interview, contributes]
Mody: With 10 being very jealous? I don’t know, like a three? I mean it’s kinda cool, but I spend enough time here that I can soak it up.
Sundquist: No, with 10 being so jealous that you live here. Oh wait, you’ve already slept in my bed!
Wang: Yeah, mine too…
Bill Gates lived in Currier House after his freshman year. What are your feelings on the Quad, and what house do you want to live in? 
Sundquist: The Quad is way far away.
Moellman: I think Adams is nice.
