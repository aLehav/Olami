A couple weeks from now millions of people will line up to watch the first of two movies based on the seventh Harry Potter book. Some will come hours in advance, some in costume, some with friends; some will cheer at the end of the movie, some may cry, and many will come back to watch again. All will come to see the story of a boy coming of age in a magical world; all will come compelled by the spell of a fairy story. But what kind of powerful spell is it that calls so many, regardless of age or class or taste?
My fourth grade teacher gave me “The Fellowship of the Ring,” but my love of fantasy began much earlier than that. C.S. Lewis’s Narnia books and Susan Cooper’s “The Dark is Rising” sequence were childhood favorites; something in me leapt up at the idea that a wardrobe could lead to an enchanted kingdom, that an uncle-turned-magician could open the way into a shadowy realm at the edges of my world. Harry’s crossing through the back of a London pub into magical Diagon Alley struck that same chord.
J.R.R. Tolkien’s address titled “On Fairy Stories” at the University of St. Andrews in 1939, a year after the publication of “The Hobbit,” helps to explain this phenomenon.  In this lecture he set out not only to define the fairy story—which he considers a nearly impossible task—but also to defend it from charges of escapism.
I grant that my childhood reading was an escape. But what kind of escape was it? An escape to mere delusion, to worlds that lured me away from reality, away from this realm of limited possibilities where animals never speak and wardrobes lead only to the last forgotten coat and the hard finality of a dusty wooden panel?
Tolkien wouldn’t have thought so. On the contrary, Tolkien thinks much of his contemporaries’ literature—literature straining for realism—escaped reality by denying universal human experiences in favor of modern minutiae, by being more concerned with factory chimneys than with trees.
“Much that... others would call ‘serious’ literature,” Tolkien writes, “is no more than play under a glass roof by the side of a swimming pool bath. Fairy-stories may invent monsters that fly the air or dwell in the deep, but at least they do not try to escape from heaven or the sea.”
In fantasy, then, we escape from the narrow confines of our own limited experience, from the crippling conviction that there is such a thing as “just” a tree or indeed “just” anything at all. In fantasy we learn to reengage the real.
Tolkien suggests that this was the direction artists of his time should take, artists growing bored of the same old art, however skillfully wrought: rather than turn on the old art, turning to purposeful misshapenness in rebellion against the well-shaped but stale, they must make us see what is old as if it were wild and new—to meet the centaur and the dragon in order to greet the horse and snake with appropriate wonder.
In “The Hosting of the Sidhe,” as in several of his early poems, W.B. Yeats acts out the escape offered by the fairy story. “Empty your heart of its mortal dream,” cries Niamh, the daughter of the god of the sea in Irish mythology. Yeats continues, “The host is rushing ‘twixt night and day, / And where is there hope or deed as fair? / Caolite tossing his burning hair, / And Niamh calling Away, come away.”
Over the course of his career Yeats also turns away from folklore only to return at last to the reality that greets us at the turn of the fairy-tale’s final page. “The Circus Animals’ Desertion,” from his last collection, has a sense of bitterness, of his being unable and unwilling to enumerate old fantastical themes. The poet is led at last back to the ground of his inspiration, the hard dirt in which his visions took root: “Now that my ladder’s gone / I must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.”
The old “masterful images” of his early poetry have faded, yet the beauty of these final lines undercuts the bitterness of that departure, sends off the old tales with fitting tenderness, and suggests the heartbreaking inexorability of the final return to reality. And this is what millions will line up to experience this November: the journey from the fantastical around at last to the terrible splendor of things as they are, a reality still more startling than the most wonder-filled tale of the wondrous realm of faerie.

Directed by Joseph G. Hodgkin ’12, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s production of “Antony and Cleopatra” takes William Shakespeare’s classic tragedy of ill-fated sexual and political liaisons and vivifies it with strong acting and truly brilliant theatrical effects. The show, which opened on Friday in the Loeb Experimental Theater and will run until November 6, draws upon such a rich array of creative elements that it breathes new life into the long and verbally complex text.
“Antony and Cleopatra” tells a fairly standard story of romance complicated by politics. Antony, a ruler of Rome, engages in an illicit love affair with Cleopatra, the queen of Egypt. Following the death of his first wife, Antony marries Octavia to ease political tensions within Rome, to Cleopatra’s great jealousy and ultimate demise. The political nuances and shifting power relations that compose the plot are secondary, however, to the dazzling theatricality of the production.
Before a single line is even uttered, the play awes, for its majestic, multi-tiered set manages to capture the distinct spirits of two great empires. Dull gray walls, linear Doric columns, and hard black wooden furniture evoke Rome’s austerity, while Alexandria’s luscious exoticism is celebrated with a rich red velvet chaise, golden goblets, and a brightly-painted backdrop of papyrus in shades of warm gold and verdant green. Perhaps most impressive is the tall, glowing obelisk which looms above Egypt, illuminated from within to reveal an expanse of haunting hieroglyphs.
Just as the actors enjoy a visually rich backdrop for their performances, so too is this aesthetic echoed in the play’s costumes. Cleopatra (Sara S. Lytle ’13) is all sparkles, often bedecked in floor-length gowns in shades of royal purple, thick layers of necklaces roping her neck and softly tinkling bangles announcing her every movement. Likewise, her faithful attendants Charmian (Susanna B. Wolk ’14) and Iras (Rachel V. Byrd ’13) consistently frame their queen’s sartorial grandeur with their own exotic costumes. With long robes cinched by leather studded belts and sandals in shades of metallic silver and gold, the two attendants infuse their Egyptian royal garb with a distinctly modern edge. In contrast to the opulent adornments of the Egyptians, all of the Roman characters are dressed in contemporary army fatigues, sporting cargo pants tucked smartly into heavy black boots. Likewise, the play’s Roman women are garbed in austere modern safari attire, their neck scarves and khakis as businesslike and practical as the Egyptian women’s heavy jewels are opulent and excessive.
In particular, Lytle takes full advantage of the lavishness afforded by her costume, inhabiting her sweeping, glittering robes with the power and the presence of the elegant queen she portrays. Constantly snaking her body, Lytle is lithe as a softly-swaying papyrus reed in moments of sensuous seduction, yet snaps like a viper to fierce, steely stiffness whenever her forceful will is met with resistance. Tall, thin, and acutely aware of her own sexual prowess, Lytle plays Cleopatra as a haughty, manipulative, jealous, and self-indulgent queen.
Like Cleopatra, the portrayal of Antony (Caleb J. Thompson ’14) evokes the spirit of a handsome, proud leader; yet Thompson plays his ruler as something of an emotionally-distant military man, whose external confidence and glory don’t quite translate to private complexity. And though distant and vaguely inaccessible as an individual character, Thompson comes to life during scenes with Lytle, as they possess excellent on-stage chemistry. Their interactions, both verbal and physical, capture the spirit of a passionate couple whose smoldering sexuality and violent anger are experienced with equal intensity.
Other notable performances include that of Emily B. Hecht ’11, who portrays Pompey, a powerful political rival of Antony and Octavian. Booming, larger-than-life, and ever in-control, Hecht entirely commands each scene she is in, whether delivering a threatening monologue to her enemies while her comrade films her in what eerily resembles a modern terrorist video, or drunkenly carousing on her ship with her newly-formed allies.
Also charming is Michael S. Segel ’14, who plays Alexas, a messenger to Cleopatra. Bright-eyed, baby-faced and delightfully perky, Segel and Lytle enjoy excellent comedic chemistry in a scene when the explosive, jealous queen must be informed that her lover Antony has just married Octavia (Georgina B. Parfitt ’13). Octavia, in turn, gracefully portrays the archetypical political wife: pearl necklace-choked, quietly reserved in manner, and deeply unfulfilled in her marriage, she is as somber and proper as her prim black dress.
In addition to its lavish costuming and sets, the play incorporates a number of creative and daring technical elements. On three occasions, brief videos of fighting animal pairs are projected onto the stage, depicting violent battles between various forms of dangerous Egyptian wildlife, such as scorpions, scarabs, and crocodiles. The music is also well-chosen, alternating between haunting Near Eastern melodies of mysterious strings and airy flutes, and loud, rough gunshot sounds to signal the arrival of enemies during war scenes. Interestingly, both acts of the play begin with brief dance interludes featuring Cleopatra’s two attendants, whose swaying and intertwining beckon the audience to join them in their exotic land. In the play’s famous closing scene, Cleopatra’s tragic suicide is electrified by the use of a live snake, whose unpredictable slithering through the actors’ hands is nothing short of riveting.
At roughly two and a half hours, the play is rather long and its adherence to the original Shakespearean text can make it verbally hard to follow at times. But even its length and somewhat complicated plot cannot obscure the brilliance of the actors and technical elements that interweave to create a truly rich and engaging performance.

Nov. 5 - 6, 8p.m. & Nov. 6, 2 p.m.
New College Theater
Directed by Samantha C. Cohen ’12
Produced by Andrea I. Moreno ’12
Access to the coveted selection of George Balanchine’s neoclassical ballet choreography requires months of planning and negotiations with the Balanchine Trust. Pieces from his renowned collection fused with exciting contemporary creations from Harvard student choreographers develop the vision for the upcoming Harvard Ballet Company’s “Barre None.”
“The Balanchine work is more on the classical side while other pieces contain music the audience will recognize and like,” the Company’s Director Samantha C. Cohen ’12 says. “We strove to have elements that were accessible while maintaining a high quality show.”
Cohen and producer Andrea I. Moreno ’12 discuss the energy and positive feedback the Company received after last year’s “Momentum.” Hoping to build off that enthusiasm, the Company invited acclaimed living guest choreographers—from Peter Pucci to Deborah Wingert—to create an even more diverse and ambitious show. “Barre None” will also feature choreography from alumna Nina K. Stoller-Lindsey ’10, Ricky D. Kuperman ’11, and Marielena Sosa ’12.
“Every show we try to foster student talent, as well as bring in guest choreographers so they have the opportunity to work with both their classmates and professional choreographers. I think this is something we offer that is really unique,” Moreno says.
Cohen and Moreno both expressed the Company’s delight to be back in the New College Theatre, a venue that enables them to incorporate interesting production factors that appeal to a wide audience.
“Sharing elements of dance with the Harvard community who might not have had that experience is really exciting,” Cohen says.

“Some people when they were young shot deer, and foxes. Faulkner shot a bear, Hemingway shot lions and a lot of things,” writes James E. Franco in his new collection of short stories on teenage vice entitled “Palo Alto.” “We shot animals, and people. But they were all small animals, and we didn’t kill anyone.” This type of grasping rationalization is typical of the narrator of “Killing Animals,” a high school student with a penchant for BB guns. He stumbles through episodes of violence and petty crime—most of which involve a BB gun—with numb defeatism. He typecasts his companions and racially brands his victims. He grasps at comparisons with literary greats to leech a modicum of meaningful self-expression from their fame. This portrait of the lost teenager would be a stark and tragic one—that is, if Franco himself managed to avoid the same simplistic and unreflective mistakes.
The compilation is Franco’s first literary attempt in an artistic career otherwise dominated by his work on screen. The actor is best known for his role as Harry Osborn in the “Spider-Man” series and his recent portrayal of poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2010 movie adaptation of “Howl.” The 11 short stories in “Palo Alto” follow a group of dissolute teenagers in the namesake Silicon Valley community, through fatal drunk driving accidents, illicit relations, and dreams of murder. For Franco, though, such torrents of physical, emotional, and sexual trauma are not symbols of vicious prejudice and selfishness; they appear to him as tragic symptoms of bleak nihilism, a sense of psychic homelessness in the complacency of suburbia.
The theme, however, is a tired one, and Franco does not manage to treat it with any originality. His formulaic plotlines almost universally involve outbursts of testosterone and pangs of regret; his characters suffer from a lack of motivation and differentiation; and his direct, terse style seems more empty than poignant. Franco’s failure to extract meaning from the chaos he depicts seems not so much a natural reaction to the teenage condition, but rather a trivial consequence of the poverty of his insight.
One of the more provocative of the “Palo Alto” pieces, entitled “Chinatown in Three Parts,” chronicles the decline of a young half-Vietnamese woman called Pam into a state of quasi-prostitution. In the space of one day, the ninth-grade narrator introduces himself to the “pretty ugly” Pam, invites her back to a friend’s house to smoke pot, and seduces her into losing her virginity by claiming, “‘I heard that Chinese people have sideways vaginas.’” Before long, and with little reflection, the narrator finds himself and his friends taking turns receiving blow jobs from the girl in an abandoned park. He sodomizes Pam with root vegetables during an orgy and offers her to the bartender of an Italian restaurant for a free meal.
Throughout each of the three sections of the story, Pam remains relatively quiet. The narrator himself presents the story as fact, with little reflection other than the occasional observation that “she got really messy.” Instead of adding to the power of the piece, though, such extreme detachment deprives the narrator—and Pam—of credible motivation. The characterizations become thin, and the reader’s investment wanes; by the time the narrator finishes, our indifference rivals his own.
It could be argued, of course, that such unreflective detachment is entirely Franco’s intention. Perhaps we should count this chronic numbness among the other, more obvious vices of the teenagers depicted. After all, the blunt, staccato tones of “Chinatown” resonate through most of the stories; to Franco, it seems almost universal. But it is precisely the refrain of this tone that weakens it; with little variation in style, Franco’s narrators bleed into one another until they are almost indistinguishable. It becomes hard to remember, at any one given point, whose perspective is currently being voiced—and thus difficult to empathize with the particularities of their problems.
One particular flaw that each of Franco’s narrators shares is a tendency for reductive description that borders on the offensive. “I’m really good in math class,” one Marissa asserts, “but I don’t announce it because I’m a girl.” “Farmers, Italians, and sociopaths kill cats,” another claims. By way of introducing the African-American population at his school, yet another says, “They got bad grades and wore parkas.” In a singular case, a blanket statement might contribute constructively to a narrator’s characterization. In such volume, however, they seem to belong more to the author than to any given character. As such, they retain only shock value.
Franco falls prey to the same kind of over-simplification in writing his characters. Their concerns are stereotypical, their quandaries textbook. Insecurity, jealousy, needless aggression, and thrill seeking are recurrent themes; perhaps unsurprisingly, teenagers wind up endangering themselves and others while under the influence of various mind-altering substances. One inebriated teen, speeding to catch his girlfriend in the clutches of a rival, kills a lonely librarian in the road; another is killed in a drunken fight over an insult. In one representative moment, a teenager bemoans his station in life: “I was weak,” he claims, “and stupid, and wimpy, and I had no opinions, and I was a bad talker, and I didn’t know how to make friends, and I had big ears, and an ugly nose, and my hair was ’fro-y, and my dick, and my stomach, and my mind were all bad.”
At certain points, however, Franco appears to turn such simplifications to his own comic advantage. “I thought I had no hair because I masturbated so much,” one narrator admits. “Picasso was a master at age sixteen and I was a perfect shit,” another observes. Still, in the context of these dark musings on the teenage condition, it is worth wondering whether these moments are properly intended as satire. At best, they are gems among the debris, moments of inspiration in an otherwise confused and shallow treatment of likewise confused and shallow teenage chaos.

Leif Ove Andsnes’s latest album, featuring the third and fourth Piano Concertos of Sergei Rachmaninov completes Andsnes’s cycle of the Rachmaninov concertos, which he began in 2005. Known primarily as a proponent of composer Edvard Grieg, the Norwegian pianist made headlines last year when he collaborated with conceptual artist Robin Rhode on “Pictures Reframed,” which combines Mussorgsky’s epic piano cycle “Pictures at an Exhibition” with film and animated images projected behind the pianist.
With his newest recording, Andsnes returns to convention with two of the great twentieth-century piano concertos of the virtuoso Russian school (Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich). In choosing this repertoire, Andsnes joins the ranks of great pianists who have made their mark on the Rachmaninov cycle. Vladimir Horowitz exuded pure romanticism in his approach, whereas Martha Argerich took the edgy, experimental route. Andsnes and company opted instead for moderation, yielding subtle though expressive results. The soloist’s impersonal, straightforward approach—bolstered by Antonio Pappano’s sumptuous London Symphony Orchestra—clears the view often fogged by virtuosic bombast, revealing nuances in Rachmaninov’s icy landscapes.
This interpretative clarity is best heard in the third concerto’s opening movement. Moving smoothly along with a moderate pulse, Andsnes’s delicate rendering of the concerto’s haunting theme is understated and elegant. In the ensuing arpeggiated runs, he maintains this poise, and an ever-present sense of restraint tempers a potentially overwhelming cascade of notes. Rachmaninov’s third concerto is infamous for the daunting technical difficulties it presentsand the composer’s own tendencies to bombast (look no further than his second symphony) threaten to alienate any innocent listener. Andsnes’s streamlined approach then serves to sidestep sensory overload. Ultimately though, the soloist does let loose, and to great effect. In an impeccable cadenza, Andsnes delays dramatic rubato until the section’s final moments, building unbearable tension in the process.
The fourth concerto’s Largomovement displays similar qualities. A relaxed atmosphere pervades this movement, where warm strings and plump pizzicati evoke a sort of pleasant ennui. Here, the soloist is not the star of the show, but merely a commentator on the orchestra’s activity. By placing himself in the background, Andsnes allows this action to unfold organically, riding the orchestral wave up to its pseudo-climax and back down again before the terrifying jolt that opens the finale.
Despite Andsnes’s smart interplay with the orchestra in the middle movement, their interpretation of Rachmaninoff’s fourth concerto is markedly less engaging than the third. Beyond a dreamlike middle section, the concerto’s concluding movement is constant stimulation, endless piano-orchestra banter that rings hollow. As such, the record comes to an unfortunate close.
The third concerto is surely the highlight of the entire affair, with its romantic Adagio and whirlwind Finale. In this final movement, Andsnes truly shines as a virtuoso as he navigates breakneck staccato passages with apparent ease and cool agility. And where Rachmaninov’s fourth concerto revels in thunderous crashes worthy of cartoonish onomatopoeia, the third concerto’s finale is exhilarating in its rhythmic propulsion. Here, orchestra and soloist triumph together on the verge between order and chaos as the Brazilian chôro pulse (in Rachmaninov, surprisingly) threatens to derail both.
The recording’s sound balance is also somewhat odd—it seems that the orchestra overpowers Andsnes in several tutti sections, with varying results. In one sense, this orchestral domination is frustrating in the climactic sections of the concertos’ first movements. We lose the soloist at the very moment he should rise to the occasion. On the other hand, this sound mix is somewhat enthralling. It feels like sitting amongst the orchestra itself, or on the soloist’s piano stool, being engulfed by giant waves of sound and engaged in a sonically intense experience.
If Andsnes’s recording is not seminal, it at least provides new looks at old favorites. His playing is smart—navigating an elegant balance between expression and virtuosity—and the sweeping narrative arc of his interpretations is worth the minor troubles along the way.

On October 26, 1977, the day after his mother died, French philosopher and literary theorist Roland Barthes began the “Mourning Diary”—a series of reflections written on small pieces of paper the size of index cards, that he kept through September 15, 1979. Compiled and published posthumously, “Mourning Diary” is Barthes’ final work.
“Mourning Diary” also functions as an accessible introduction to Barthes’ writing, style, and method. Barthes was a pioneering figure of structuralist theory, one of the foundational schools of postwar thought in the West. Structuralism’s claims about the nature of language as a radical network of signification—a structure whose own meaning is self-prescribed—reverberate through the world of literature and cultural theory to this day.
Barthes’ own search for meaning is evident in the notes presented in “Mourning Diary.” Henriette Barthes—to whom he refers as “maman”—lived with her son throughout his adulthood, her death—consequently the loss of Roland’s closest confidant and friend—had a destabilizing effect on his life.  As his mourning progresses, Barthes learns to live by himself without his mother’s physical presence, and to cope with the loneliness he feels despite the sympathy of those around him. He continuously contemplates his own imminent death and the uncertainty of time; he writes, “The truth about mourning is quite simply: now that maman is dead, I am faced with death (nothing any longer separates me from it except time.”
His notes are full of moments in which he records being suddenly struck by sadness. In one note, Barthes writes of crying after the rather ordinary experience of shopping, and of hearing the girl behind the counter say, “Voilà,” the word he would use when bringing his mother something as he took care of her. Each bout of grief is more intense than the last, Barthes explains: “At each ‘moment’ of suffering, I believe it to be the very one in for the first time I realize my mourning.” Anyone who has lost a loved one can relate to Barthes’ details of the frequent and unexpected feelings of sorrow that well up during the course of everyday life.
These descriptions of arresting grief are perhaps the most poignant moments in the work, but Barthes’ notes are consistently fluid and thoughtful throughout. Despite the seemingly short, fragmented style of this diary, a constant theme is Barthes’ conflict between his grief and his natural literary mode of expression. Although he writes towards the beginning of his notes, “I don’t want to talk about it, for fear of making literature,” he later admits, “No doubt I will be unwell, until I write something having to do with her.” Writing seems to be a necessary part of his grieving process, despite his fear that whatever literature he makes will not live up to the memory of his mother or the intensity of his sadness.
As Barthes explains this inner conflict, “Mourning Diary,” provides a window into the process by which he wrote his last major work, “Camera Lucida,” in which he analyzes the photographs of his mother. Although Barthes’ ‘diary’ seems for the most part intended as an outlet for his private thoughts, he was at least partially conscious of the literary value they might eventually have. At one point he writes, “Who knows? Maybe something valuable in these notes?”
Pervading Barthes’ notes is the spirit of his principle philosophy: any person has the freedom to decipher meaning in any aesthetic. This philosophy has direct bearing on the relationship between Barthes’s depiction of his mother and his idea of literature. “Maman” is presented as an image of perfection throughout his notes: “How maman is present in all I have written: in that there is everywhere a notion of the Sovereign God.” Barthes’s “maman” is always honest and never misrepresents herself, because she is never, as Barthes’ describes, a “pose, deliberate image.” In essence, Barthes’s proffers his mother as the symbol of the pinnacle of truth.
His recording of his mourning process leads to a deeper contemplation on his mother as a real, unimagined figure. These contemplations eventually lead him to realize the necessity of stark truth in literature. Near the end of his diary, Barthes concludes: “Literature = the only region of Nobility (as maman was noble.)”
“Mourning Diary,” is itself a work of literature as Barthes defines it. As Barthes believed that a person, and as such, a reader, has the agency to create his own meaning, so the reader is forced to interpret meaning in these compiled notes that may or may not have been intended for publishing. Despite its brief, fragmentary—and therefore somewhat incomplete—nature “Mourning Diary” nevertheless provides a comprehensive view of Barthes’ understanding of his mother, his grief, and his writing process.

After writing 10 novels and five collections of stories, author Rose Tremain should be a master at navigating her own literary terrain. Yet, in her eleventh novel, “Trespass,” the English writer wanders astray while attempting to explore how haunting childhood memories, consuming desire, and disputed hometown property can bring about the collision of four tainted souls.  Although “Trespass” has potential in the themes it undertakes, it fails to go beyond the formulaic, archetypal thriller and only wades in the concepts of envy, corruption, sex, greed, and love without realizing their complex scope.
“Trespass” is constructed as a typical thriller. Set in a small, isolated, and hauntingly beautiful village in southern France, the novel revolves around two major story arcs that become quite predictably connected. The first concerns the elderly Anthony Verey, a self-absorbed but deeply insecure antiques enthusiast, struggling to come to terms with the downward trajectory of his career. Unable to handle the fame and prosperity of his peers, and unable to let go of or sell his ‘beloveds,’ he turns to his sister, Veronica (nicknamed V) for a fresh start. Moving in with V and her artist girlfriend, Kitty, Anthony consequently falls in love with the prospects of the countryside life. As he searches for a French abode in hope of jumpstarting his future, his eyes are immediately fixed on an estate entitled Mas Lunel.
Parallel to this storyline, brother and sister Aramon and Audrun Lunel happen to live on the very piece of land that Anthony desires. Bound by a dark past of both paternal and sibling sexual abuse, the two have a twisted relationship of hatred and deep understanding of one another’s strengths and vulnerabilities. Things begin spiraling out of control when Aramon and Audrun disagree on whether or not to sell the property. After much scheming and dreaming, the separate Verey and Lunel sibling spheres overlap, culminating in a dramatic confrontation between all four characters.
With only four major protagonists and full chapters that alternate back and forth between the characters’ viewpoints, “Trespass” could easily unfold as a study of the complexity of human relationships. Yet it quickly becomes evident that Anthony, Veronica, Aramon, and Audrun are not only unlikeable, but also a tad cliché. Tremain attempts to make her protagonists multi-faceted, but only ends up assigning certain sinful traits to certain characters and attributing these flaws to disturbing and troubling childhoods.
Anthony, on one hand, suffers from an almost Dorian Gray-like obsession with glory and eternal life. He is overwhelmed by the beauty of young boys, which, he feels, forces him to “enslave himself to their virility and youth.” Such insecurities are explained in flashbacks during which an adolescent Anthony desperately tries to please his dismissive, irritable, and unfaithful mother. In other words, his constant need for approval and attention stems from a childhood devoid of love. Thus, although the antique collector has the potential to be a complex figure, his situation is reduced to this simple cause and effect equation.
Similarly, Aramon and Kitty lack the substance needed to blossom into fully dynamic characters. While the former is simply depicted as the villain who is caught in the abused-abuser cycle, the latter is only defined by her sexual jealousy towards Anthony, who has distracted his sister from her lesbian lover. Over and over again, Kitty describes how intolerable Anthony is and how annoyed she is to have been “relegated to second place.” While these thoughts and emotions are understandable and fundamentally human, Tremain reiterates them so much that they lose their original potency.
Despite the fact that Tremain sacrifices depth for ineffective breadth, she does manage to showcase her skills as a writer through mood and tone, creating an overall landscape that becomes more memorable and powerful than the characters. The author poetically describes Mas Lunel’s desolate yet beautiful surroundings: “On the bare mother-rock, tiny particles of matter accrued in cracks and declivities: filaments of dead leaves, wisps of charred broom. And in the air, almost invisible, were specks of dust, grains of sand and these settled in amongst the detritus, making a bed for het spores of lichen and moss.” Likewise, the peculiar fogginess of the estate is evoked with mysterious and oddly fantastical descriptions of “plumed dark weeds that hugged the shingle banks of the Gardon in a few shady corners, where snakes sometimes made their nests, in places the fishermen avoided.”
The ghostly mood is also accentuated by Tremain’s incorporation of a silkworm as a motif throughout the novel. The writer’s descriptions of these creatures as “incubated worms under their heavy skirts, white worms against the white flesh of their bellies” serve as a foreboding indicator of all bad things to come. Yet, even though these descriptions are eerily effective, they appear so often in the novel that the author spells out the silkworms’ symbolic presence too blatantly, and by the end of the work the motif is tired and overused.
Even though Tremain’s prose in “Trespass,” is often elegantly constructed, the novel as a whole is no more than a typical contemporary thriller with little originality or realistic insight into human behavior. With themes and characters that are simplified to their most generic, trite forms, Tremain’s newest work is far from captivating and fails to reach its full potential.

“Which came first, the music or the misery?” This question, asked by “High Fidelity” protagonist, Rob Fleming, a depressed record store owner, is more or less inapplicable to Warpaint’s debut album: the music came first, and it’s pretty miserable. Gloomy albums are not innately bad, but successful, gloomy bands like the National and The xx encourage listeners to indulge their sorrow by being gloomy in lots of different ways. Warpaint aims for the dark atmospherics of The xx, with whom they recently toured, but Warpaint’s repeated use of glossy, deep bass loops and unimaginative guitar lines to create dolorous atmospheres is overwhelming and begins to wear rapidly. Unfortunately, the band foregoes some of the essentials, like nuance and songcraft, in creating the nine overly similar tracks of “The Fool.”
Despite their limited tonal vocabulary (re: gloomy and reverberating), which constrains the LP’s 47 minutes, Warpaint succeeds in creating movement within the songs, affecting dynamic shifts with Stella Mozgawa’s restrained yet powerful drumbeats. The controlled beats coupled with the tracks’ sparse orchestration makes even the slightest alteration, be it an additional hi-hat twitch or tom breakdown, doubly effective. “Bees” begins with a basic drum machine track that keeps the song interesting despite the overly-produced, cookie-cutter riffs tossed off by the guitarists. The creative drum work is only reinforced by the group’s strong melodies and vocal arrangements. However, the disappointingly unimaginative bass and guitar lines keep the song from realizing the potential suggested by the drum and vocal parts.
In fact, the bass and guitar work on the album is remarkably lackluster, with every part falling short of the atmospheric effect it intends to create while blatantly suggesting what it’s failing to achieve. The bass and guitar parts function as placeholders, as if inserted into the songs by ambitious musicians who thought they’d find inspiration later on in the recording process.
“Composure” is perhaps the most glaring example of these shortcomings. The song begins with an embarrassingly bombastic and lengthy intro. The guitar repeats a commonplace chord progression while the drums dramatically flutter behind each exasperatingly declarative strum. A dispensable bass line mumbles beneath a busy guitar line, which eventually fuses itself into what sounds like a gesture to the full-blown guitar freakouts of Johnny Greenwood, but with only some of the feeling and none of the style.  The melodic instruments become mere unimaginatively atmospheric tools, and when the song slows to a stop with a sound like a turntable powering down, you barely realize it was ever spinning at the proper speed.
The album’s single, “Undertow,” suggests some of the unrealized potential of the album.  The bass chords are simple, but pleasant—almost nostalgic—and the guitar line is more restrained than on the other tracks. The vocalists experiment with beautifully melancholic harmonies, often progressing in heart wrenching, contrary motion à la Stevie Nicks’ best vocal performances. The singers cast lovely, if obscure lyrics over the beautiful instrumental parts. Lines like “Your brown eyes are my blue skies / They light up the rivers that the birds fly over” are fittingly evocative, even if the line “nobody ever has to find what’s in my mind tonight” proves an apt statement given the occasionally inscrutable nature of the group’s impressionistic lyrics.
On “Baby,” one of the two acoustic tracks of the album, the band offers another saddening snapshot of what could have been. Though the music of the song is still relatively unimaginative, it’s not the track’s most prominent feature.  Instead, the three vocalists ease out some of the album’s most delicately beautiful melody lines, each memorable part blowing like a soft breeze through the speakers, mixing with the others, but never interfering. This is what the album was meant to be and what, at its best moments, it is. The unimaginative music is merely the basis over which the singers cast their siren song.  Unfortunately, in most every other song on the album, the beautiful vocal work is weakened by pervasively dull musicianship. If nothing else, this album suggests that Warpaint has interesting ideas that, if properly executed, would truly make for something special.

Taylor Swift’s “Speak Now,” though it has glimmers of promise, never fully shines:  while her lyrics can at times show depth of thought, her voice inevitably sounds like the screams of a young girl, and her style is still stuck at the level of when she made her debut as a sixteen year old. Her new album serves mainly to show that, though full of potential, Taylor Swift is far from maturation. Greatly overshadowed by her first two albums “Taylor Swift” and “Fearless,” “Speak Now” unfortunately does not yet find Taylor Swift taking full advantage of all of her talents.
Even after the public fallout with Taylor Lautner of the “Twilight” film series fame, Taylor Swift cannot muster up expressive vocals that match her emotive lyrics . She wails on and on about what “she should have known,” whom her heart belongs to, and the fate of her “Last Kiss.” Swift’s voice is sweet and clear, but she fails to experiment with its range. Everything becomes a monotonic blur of complaint as she sings the same pitches over and over again, though in slightly varying arrangements over the course of the album. Swift garners praise for her excellent live shows due to her well-developed vocals, and it is a shame that she does not fully take advantage of her skills in her recordings.
Though not all sung in the same key, the songs in the album fall into two major rhythmic categories: upbeat and happy, and slow and morose. Tempos of each category are near identical which makes it difficult to differentiate between songs. Each track either starts with a guitar chord in a major key or a steady beat on the cymbals, and there is very little variation in the layout of the songs. Using these leads, the songs progress into rhythmic repetition, mostly in common time.
“Speak Now” does at times showcase Swift’s potential for song writing, which makes her other shortcomings that much more noticeable and disappointing. In “Innocent,” and “Never Grow Up,” Swift speaks of the days “before the monsters caught up to you” and of nostalgia for a time where “no one’s ever burned you / nothing’s ever left you scarred.” These lyrics seem to come from a thoughtful young woman who has real regrets and hopes. In “Dear John,” though it is held back by the repetitive lyrics, she shows a sense for poetics when she sings that she “took your matches before fire could catch me.”
This flow of great lyrics is unfortunately butchered by ones that can only be described as immature. In “Mean,” it is unclear whether Swift is speaking metaphorically or literally about abuse. She repeatedly calls him “mean,” and thumbs her nose at his ability to succeed in life. The musical sensibility in this song is at odds with the lyrics as well, as the quick and almost merry beats of the song seem to mock the gravity of the lyrics. Similarly, Swift complains bitterly about another girl stealing her man in “Better than Revenge.” Witty phrases like “no amount of vintage dress gives you dignity” and “sophistication isn’t what you wear”—which show Swift’s potential to create great pop artifacts—are lost in the snide, unbecoming tone of the song
The resounding problem with Swift’s new album is that it is torn between promising flashes of her talent and discouraging reminders that she has yet to mature as an artist. While her “not a girl, not yet a woman” attitude is still sweet and endearing, Swift cannot keep up the act for much longer. Her lyrics do show signs of growth, but she has yet to rid herself of the the naïveté of her voice and style. Her developing ability to write meaningful lyrics is unfortunately caked and concealed by her self-imposed limitations in other regards. “Speak Now” falls short of the trajectory of growth shown between her debut and sophomore albums. However, her talents and expanding skills are clear, and there are golden classics waiting to be uncovered once Swift learns to realize her potential.

It’s a long way from an uncle’s attic to a professional studio, and Small Black are feeling the distance. The indie rock quartet self-recorded its first release, an eponymous EP, in the aforementioned attic in 2009, garnering praise for the record’s creativity and intimacy. Their recent debut LP, “New Chain,” came from quite another source—reputable indie label Jagjaguwar—and while Small Black’s tracks are undeniably fuller-bodied and more complex for it, they also appear somewhat stripped of the band’s individual creative spark.
“New Chain” certainly sees Small Black flexing their composition muscles with the expansive production opportunities a studio provides—each track is a dizzying collage of synthesizer textures and electronic beats, deftly laced with neo-tribal percussion and gently breathed vocals.
“Camouflage” begins the album with a dark synthesizer pattern and the heavy footfalls of a drum machine, gradually weaving in shimmering keyboard waves and clattering percussion until it rises into a chaotic interplay of synthesizer wails. The rest of the album follows suit, an elegantly choreographed bustle of synthesizers, beats and vocal echoes. “Photojournalist” builds a woozy electronic opening into a perfect blur of computerized swirls and thuds; “Panther” floats soaring vocals over delicate tones and an echoing beat; “Invisible Grid” fades the album out with an ethereal texture of synthesizer shrills.
As works of technical composition alone, the tracks are near perfect—they are cohesive through a common palette of sounds, but they remain diverse and balanced through carefully organized, admirably complex mixing. In this regard, “New Chain” is a triumph, a phantasmagoric and captivatingly dense world of sound.
Yet in the context of Small Black’s contemporaries and influences, “New Chain” also shows some unwillingness to expand from the sounds of well-established groups—or, for that matter, to further explore the unique sound Small Black seemed already to have.
The DNA of the band’s predecessors is glaringly obvious in “New Chain”—Yeasayer’s tribal-infused indie-pop, Flying Lotus’s garbled beat collages, Passion Pit’s glittering synthesizer waves, and (by far most evidently) circa-2008 Animal Collective’s electro-freak-folk aesthetic. “New Chain” seems to take pieces from all these sources and knead them together into track after track. It’s not done unconvincingly; indeed, Small Black’s tracks often turn out as good (and sometimes even better) than those of their influencers, but they lack exploration of any original sound.
This is particularly tragic in Small Black’s case, considering they already exhibited a promisingly novel sound in their earlier releases. They weren’t just another Animal Collective imitator—rather, the electronic beats that drive “New Chain” were combined with lo-fi fuzz and jangling riffs to create a unique hybrid. But instead of expanding on or reproducing this sound, they have renounced their cross-breed and stuck to collages of purely electronic beats and textures.
Furthermore, the “Small Black EP” style seemed to capture a feeling their new sound cannot. On “New Chain,” they are unable to resist the charms of studio-produced instrumentals and dense layering, but this approach is insufficient to evoke the depth and emotional power some of their songs could have had.
In particular, “Light Curse,” “Crisp 100s,” and the title track are contemplative and meandering as well as relatively long, and not surprisingly they begin to feel boring or repetitive. For most bands this would present a flaw in songwriting, but for Small Black it is a question of method—with the intimacy of Small Black’s lo-fi side present on their earlier work, these tracks could have been raw, tender or restless. Instead, the band stubbornly uses the same old formula of echoing vocals, unobtrusive beats and undulating synthesizers, which ends up feeling incongruous and purposeless for such slower, gentler pieces.
Granted, these tracks can still be considered impressively mixed and dazzlingly lush—their flaw is that they carry little emotional weight because they frame contemplation in the same elements that made cuts like “Search Party” and “Camouflage” energetic. Small Black seem too entranced by the magic of the studio to consider their creative intuition.
Even so, “New Chain” is admittedly a very strong debut LP overall—new to the studio, Small Black already show themselves to be confident composers, clearly possessing the chops to craft a lush, cohesive and sturdy addition to the neo-psychedelic canon. But presently they are merely one link in this chain—to begin forming their own truly new chain, they need only return to their creative spark in tandem with this album’s evident compositional skill.

Emily Dolan, Assistant Professor of Music at the University of Pennsylvania, describes Spectralism as a renaissance. “[Spectral music] is the rebirth of musical aesthetics—the return of music to human perception and sensation,” says Dolan, who was a panelist for “Sensations of Tone.” Held in the exhibition space of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments on October 27 and 28, this event showcased the movement of Spectralism, which uses the spectrum of sound to influence musical compositions. Covering an array of topics from the history of Spectralism to its various components, “Sensations of Tone” also featured vocalist Jane Sheldon and the Firebird Ensemble. The musicians performed pieces by prominent Spectralists.
Sheldon and Peter Godfrey-Smith, Professor of Philosophy, envisioned “Sensations of Sound” about seven months ago. They approached Peter L. Galison ’77, Professor of History of Science and of Physics, with the concept. “This sounds like a perfect opportunity to mix science and art,” said Galison, recalling the proposal.
According to Sheldon, the Spectral movement began in the 19th century as a reaction to the mathematical, formulaic methods by which composers were producing music. Music theory first originated as a collection of loose conventions, typically sounds that had been observed to please the ear. Later, however, it came to be a series of equations that dictated what music should be.
“The aim of the [Spectral] movement was to go back to how sound was experienced by any human ear. The aim was to create things human ears found interesting,” said Sheldon.
According to Sheldon, Spectralists started producing music that subtly altered a note’s dominant chord so the ear could perceive these slight changes. The shifts exposed tones, pitches, and timbre more fully. With the advent of computers in the 1970s, Spectralists could use graphical and scientific representations of sound waves to portray slight modifications in different components of music.
Dolan began the panel by defining timbre as “everything that remains after pitch and dynamic level” are extracted from the music. The term timbre was first coined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau as a vague, perceivable difference between qualities of sounds. A sound’s timbre can discern its harshness, softness, darkness, or brightness. Over time, as new instruments were invented, and bands and orchestras expanded, the increasing diversity of instruments gave conductors a choice of a variety of timbre. Conductors could envision an overall sound and pick instruments according to their ability to produce timbre that would contribute to that sound.
Pitch, as another component of sound, also became a field of study in Spectralism. “Pitch is a more subtle experience than it may seem,” said Eric Heller, Professor of Chemistry and of Physics. “It masquerades as an objective attribute of sounds… not measurable in the sense of frequency.” Ears summarize sound the same way eyes process what they receive before a person perceives the image she “sees,” Heller said.
“What makes Spectralism unusual is that diverse parameters—timbre, pitch, tone, sounds—are all very closely related and often beautifully connected,” said panelist Alexander Rehding, Professor of Music.
Michael A. Einziger, guitarist and lead composer of the rock band Incubus, had a musical background that neglected certain intellectual aspects of music. He was accustomed to, as he says, “picking up instruments and banging on them.”
“Rock musicians tend to frown upon the intellectualization of music,” he said. “They think that it’s got to come from some raw emotional place.” Einziger, who is taking courses at Harvard, says experiencing an “intellectualized” environment has countered his impressions of the purpose music serves in his life.
“I felt like I was seeing music though a specific lens and had a desire to expand upon that. There are underlying structures to things like sound. If you just hear them with an unaided ear, it will sound a certain way,” he said.
Einziger notes that technological developments have allowed further exploration of music, by dissecting sound to tone, timbre, and pitch. According to Einziger, just as magnifying lenses and microscopes aided biological understandings of life, new technologies in music are aiding a physiological understanding of music.
Panelist Jimena Canales, Associate Professor of History of Science, discussed how graphs and mathematics can be used to analyze sound. According to Canales, how waves stimulate a particular organ influences the sensation felt by a person. “The differences between seeing and hearing, and hearing and touch, are caused by how they excite different nerve apparatus,” Canales said.
Throughout the performances of Sheldon and the Firebird Ensemble, the sounds they were producing were represented on a graph. The x-axis depicted time, while the y-axis depicted frequency: the higher the vibrations, the higher the waves on the y-axis. The color of the waves represented loudness, ranging from black to blue to green to yellow—black being no sound and yellow being the loudest.
Galison hopes the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments can use their exhibition space to further showcase similar performances in order to bring exposure to its collection. “After all,” he said, “we want to do things with the instruments—we want to bring together scientists, musicians, all types of people.”

“This is a weird town,” observes Frank, a visiting photographer, of Shirley, Vt., in Annie Baker’s “Body Awareness.”
“It’s small,” offers Jared, the son of Frank’s hosts, by way of explanation.
“Small and weird,” Frank mutters.
Although most of “Body Awareness”—directed by Paul Daigneault in a SpeakEasy Stage Company production at the Boston Center for the Arts—takes places in the home of Phyllis (Adrianne Krstanksy) and her partner Joyce (Paula Plum), it immediately becomes clear that the show’s exploration of empathy and political correctness is as much an appreciation of the charming weirdness of Baker’s fictional college town as it is about the experiences of this unconventional family. Its amiable performances and polished production save “Body Awareness” from falling victim to flaws in storytelling and character, and it proves to be an entertaining and rambunctious—if insubstantial—visit to a town rich with contradictions.
The story follows the conflicts that ensue when women’s studies professor Phyllis, who is organizing Body Awareness Week at Shirley State University, volunteers to host Frank (Richard Snee), a photographer famous for his provocative female nudes. Phyllis feels threatened by Frank’s “objectifying” photography even as Joyce is drawn to his unflappable joie de vivre. In a mostly parallel storyline that never fully integrates with the Phyllis-Joyce-Frank triangle, Jared (Gregory Pember), in denial about his Asperger’s Syndrome, becomes increasingly erratic as he tries to prove to his mothers that he can have a normal social life.
One flaw in the play’s script mitigates another: It is so overstuffed with action, conflict, and symbols that the plot’s melodrama never fully sinks in. This  combined with the characters’ humorous banter, makes for entertaining if not thought-provoking viewing. In particular, Snee’s wry portrayal of Frank injects balance and levity into a dynamic that might otherwise be weighed down by the other characters’ neuroses.
Given Baker’s clear talent for crackling, observant dialogue, it is surprising that her portrayal of Phyllis is so far off the mark. The character is intended as a gentle send-up of academia, but Phyllis is portrayed as unable to say anything remotely intelligent about gender studies. The interludes in which she introduces events for Body Awareness Week are painful not only for her difficulty with public speaking, but for her obvious ignorance of the topics she discusses.
“There’s the gaze,” she says in the particularly insipid final speech, “and the white male, and the white male gaze, and they all relate back to each other!” She refers to “Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom” for “quotes to use in [her] speech” and typically enough, reads “Middlesex” in bed. Academics share many qualities that deserve to be satirized, but in general, ignorance about their field is not among them. It is ultimately unclear whether Baker simply does not understand gender studies beyond platitudes from “Women’s Bodies,” or if Phyllis is simply an extremely misguided parody. Just as one begins to accept her rather implausible personality, she does an about face, embracing Frank and letting go of her dogmatic political correctness—an abrupt shift that is weakly motivated by the preceding events.
The script’s rough patches belie the gorgeous technical execution; there are no curtains at the Stanford Calderwood Pavilion, the better for the audience to admire Cristina Todesco’s elaborate set design. The action takes place entirely inside Phyllis and Joyce’s home, and the set’s careful detail—the worn board games, the frumpy dishtowels, the hodgepodge of refrigerator magnets—and warm color scheme do as much to expose the dynamic between the characters as the action and the dialogue. Similar attention is lavished on the costumes, which are keenly attuned to the characters’ sensibilities and insecurities.
If “Body Awareness” falls short as a satire of liberal academia, it succeeds as a portrait of a family—its most entertaining and insightful moments are not the confrontations between Joyce and Phyllis, but rather the quotidian interactions as the characters try to live with their guest and with each other. The comedic climax, when Joyce, Phyllis, and Jared attempt to recreate the Seder that Frank demonstrates in the first act, is more poignant than their tearful arguments just moments before. Ultimately, the script of “Body Awareness” has both heart and charisma—it’s just not where Baker seems to think it is.

Few stand-out performers dominate the mainstream, straight-ahead jazz field these days. Then, there are those rare musicians like Detroit native Regina Carter, who use the spirit of jazz to create essentially genreless but engaging music. This Saturday, Carter performed with her touring quartet at the Charles Hotel’s Regattabar, and transformed what could have been a simple set into a sophisticated musical showcase. Carter, arguably the most well-known jazz violonist in the world today, used the fundamentals of jazz to create music that can’t be called straight-ahead, yet remains in the tradition by coupling improvisation and jazz rhythms and techniques to tunes and melodies borrowed from other cultures—in this case, Africa and its diaspora.
Carter’s quartet, comprised of Will Holshouser on accordion, Chris Lightcap on bass, Alvester Garnett on drums, and Yakouba Sissoko on kora—a 21-stringed West African harp lute—seemed so diverse as to border on whimsical, yet its sound was precise and carefully selected, just like the arrangements themselves. Carter opened the set with an arrangement of “N’Teri,” a song by legendary Malian guitarist Habib Koité. It began with a shimmering interplay between the kora and the violin, both plucking their strings to create a rubbing, fast-paced tonal interplay that formed the core of the piece. The accordion gently supplemented their melody, weaving the entire tonal texture together through its distinctive tone. They sounded like a band of traveling gypsies, playfully borrowing from the jazz string tradition that partially began with Django Reinhard, a Gypsy jazz violinist. However, Carter and her group maintained their own, distinct tone the entire time, creating a new kind of fusion music that defies classification in a tradition or a genre.
One of the strongest songs of the evening was Carter’s reinterpretation of “Artistiya,” a song by the blind Malian Afro-pop couple Amadou and Mariam. The original, which has a tight, pulsing guitar beat overlaid with light, almost bird-like traditional singing, is a driving, danceable tune. Lightcap opened on bass, sliding into a supple groove, which Garnett then supplemented with a popping, delicate damp beat. Sissoko, a virtuoso on the kora, frenetically plucked the strings, improvising on the vocal solos of the original to produce a glistening, rising sound. Holshouser’s accordion played off Carter’s riffs, which quickly morphed from a straight reinterpretation of the melody into a fiery, bluesy solo. The entire song was a beautiful example of what this curious group could produce—the sound melded into one pulse overlaid by Carter’s fiercely brilliant playing.
Despite Carter’s brilliance and the pulse of the tune, the group didn’t manage to pull off the original grittiness—a slightly lo-fi homespun funk—of “Artistiya.” Throughout the evening, there was always something slightly too safe about the sound, despite the unusual combination of instruments and tunes. This is perhaps due to Carter’s strict training under the Suzuki method as a child—her tone is always clean, precise and deliberate, no matter how fast-paced her playing. It’s one of her great strengths as a musician, but almost limits the reach of her group in how deep their groove and their playing can extend.
This was also evident in the musical project that the group presented that evening—the musicians were excited to be reinterpreting lesser-known African melodies, but handled them with so much respect that the fundamental spontaneity of musical cross-pollination was sometimes less apparent. Before two of the pieces—a traditional Ugandan song, “Mwana Talitambula,” whose title roughly translates to “The Child Will Never Walk,” and “Zerapicki,” a Mauritian accordion dance—Carter paused to play ‘field clips’ of the originals. The arrangements were beautiful—in particular, “Mwana Talitambula” featured Carter playing artificial harmonics on her violin with Holshouser on the accordion. Together, they produced piercing, shimmering lines of sound, like two gold threads rubbing together. Yet both pieces were enshrouded with a weighty respect and care for the musical tradition they were borrowing from—respect that is important, but almost overshadows the possibilities for creative play. To a certain extent, the strongest songs of the night were simply the ones based on the most compelling original tunes, no matter how much the group’s own improvisations shone.
In a way, Carter is responding to another musical lineage that has been gaining a lot of ground lately with the rediscovery of jazz- and funk-influenced traditional music coming out of Africa and its diaspora. One of the most well-known examples is “Ethiojazz,” prominently featured on a music series called “Ethopiques,” a compilation of jazz and funk Ethiopian music recorded by Amha Records in the 1960s and ‘70s. This kind of musical approach was found all over the world in the 1970s, extending from Ghana to the French Caribbean. These musicians borrowed from jazz irreverently and spontaneously, organically extending their understanding of sound and music. Carter, by contrast, is carrying out her project with the utmost deliberation, showcasing each tune and its tradition before demonstrating what she has done with it. On one hand, this is a great way to bring awareness to the beauty of indigenous music; on the other, the care and the planning put into the project carry the danger of making Carter’s group seem less like a jam-filled improvisational ensemble, and more like a collective of talented ethnomusicologists.
However, Carter and her group remain fantastic musicians, and their skill and musical feeling feed the project’s vitality and move it beyond potential pitfalls. In the middle of the set, Carter stepped away from her arrangements to do a more straight-ahead jazz tune, simply with bass, drums and accordion, and here the band truly came into its own. Holshouser played his instrument like a piano, starting out with short, clipped riffs that prompted Carter’s dipping violin. The playful duet almost bordered on silly at times—Holshouser somehow spread his sound to mimic a Hammond B-3 organ, underpinning the piece. Carter soulfully dipped and slid through her notes, creating a swinging melancholy that was pure jazz at its root. Garnett exploded on the drums, driving the beat forward with a virtuosic solo of snaps, crackles and syncopated beats—he yelled over his own playing, throwing out guttural groans and shouts that really made the room and the music come alive. That spontaneity, the life and movement of their playing, was the stand-out moment of the night.
Whether playing beautiful African melodies or simply quoting old standards in a new way, Regina Carter and her band were at their best when they forgot about musical tradition and simply channeled the real spirit of jazz.

“The more beautiful the map, the more you should distrust it,”  Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Professor John R. Stilgoe warns the room at large. It is 9:25 a.m., and already the room is slowly filling for a 10 o’clock class. The digital generation listens in rapt attention as they are told they are timid and gullible; corporations, and maybe even the government, are taking advantage of their insecurities; and their faith in cartographical honesty is just the tip of the iceberg.
Only the naive, then, would see maps as pure realism, unadulterated representations of the world as it really is, rare opportunities for total objectivity. However, beneath the geographical shapes and boundary lines that constitute our image of the map lies an unseen, intricate web of decisions. These decisions—rather than the straightforward ‘content’ of maps—inform the studies and artwork of a small but vibrant cartographical community on campus. Harvard houses a world-renowned collection of antique and modern maps; many of its most compelling and original pieces have recently gone on display in an exhibition entitled “Rev. Badger’s Misfits: Deviations and Diversions” in Pusey Library.
The burgeoning activity of this community at Harvard has demonstrated that maps are not studied simply for their informational value. Rather, they are seen as vital cultural artifacts, conceptual art objects, or as purely theoretical representations. In design conceits and the inclusion of content that extends beyond mere land formation, mapmakers express more than geographical relations. Rather, they make subtle arguments about the way we conceptualize our built and natural environments.
DYSTOPIAN TOPOGRAPHY
Maps can depict more than simple geography, and yet for us to recognize a map as such we must see color patterns, borders, topography, place names, and natural features. “Schlarraffenlandes,” a piece in the “Rev. Badger” exhibit, plays with this dual reality. Its imaginary continent, which resembles a misshapen homemade pizza or denatured plant cell, could easily be mistaken for a distorted view of the Middle East. Made by Peter Schenk, a famous cartographer of the late seventeenth century, the map is modeled on a satirical poem by Sans Sachs more than a century earlier. It  boasts countries with Latinate names like “Bibonia” (Land of Drunkards). Bibonia in turn features towns with idiomatic German toponyms like “Schlampen” (Guzzle) and “Schickihnheim” (Send Him Home).
“It’s a dystopia,” says Joseph Garver, the librarian in charge of map research and acquisitions. Garver, who sits at the main desk in Pusey’s map room and sports a fittingly distinguished and scraggly white beard, is the curator of the “Rev. Badger” exhibit. The exhibit displays a selection of the works that eluded categorization under the scrutiny of the map collection curator from 1889 to 1892, Rev. Henry Clay Badger. Badger was the first to impose a rigid classification system on the collection, though it dates back to the historic donation of Israel Thorndike in 1818. The university now owns more than 400,000 sheet maps, 6,000 atlases, and several thousand antiquarian maps, making its collection the oldest and one of the largest in the country.
“The collection is adequately used by faculty and graduate students, but I wish that more undergraduates would come in,” says Garver. In his experience, undergraduates tend to find the map room only during the two or three weeks before they graduate or just in order to print out a map for dorm room decoration.
STORIES OF SPACE
While students may not know about the esoteric underground beige box that is Harvard’s world-class map collection, there has been a recent outcropping of theses and other projects that relate to maps as art. Ben C. Cosgrove ’10, a former music concentrator, made an auditory map of Massachusetts as his senior thesis. After traveling the state and conducting a series of interviews, Cosgrove composed a 20-minute piece and wrote an accompanying essay. “The central argument of the thesis was about showing the changing relationship between people and land as you travel from the western part of the state to the eastern one. It’s a balance that shifts pretty steadily,” says Cosgrove. “It worked as a pretty cool narrative arc: you start out in the mountains and work your way into the city.” The product is an auditory collage of instrumentals, interviews, and field recordings of ambient noise.
In its aesthetic conception, Cosgrove’s piece seems diametrically opposed to the traditional notion of maps as means to ends, objects only as valuable as they are useful. Cosgrove admits that “understanding a place and how you feel about a place is obviously such a subjective thing,” but argues nonetheless that “trying to represent that seems like just as noble a venture as trying to represent roads or mountains.” In fact, Cosgrove’s sonic map may be seen as no less subjective in its viewpoint than those very same road and mountain maps. “Any map is a distillation of something, of whatever the cartographer deems the relevant points of something are. It’s way of conveying points about a place, idea, or system,” he says.
The project that Rebecca A. Cooper ’11, an inactive Crimson arts writer, worked on over the summer bears more material similarity to conventional maps. Still, it is an equally significant departure from their characteristic use.  Cooper walked around Manhattan handing out blank maps of the borough and asking each person she met to fill in whatever was significant to them about the city. “In order to get a complete picture of a city you need to refract it and see it from a million different views,” says Cooper. For her, pure representation of the city’s geographic and built features does not accurately depict the city as it is. “By the time I was a senior [in high school],” she says, “every street corner was loaded with emotion. To map the street just in order to get there in the future didn’t manage to capture anything that was meaningful.” Though the different mappings of New York that constitute Cooper’s piece are disparate in form and content—one map is covered in graffiti, one shows simply a workplace and home, another a series of sexual misadventures—she believes that the collection provides a holistic representation of the city’s most salient features.
LOST IN TRANSLATION
Both Cosgrove’s and Cooper’s works pose a fundamental question about their medium: if their pieces count as maps, then what are the essential, unifying qualities that all maps possess? Garver elucidates the standard notion of a map, which is “a graphical representation of spatial relations.” Stilgoe subscribes to a similar concept, claiming that a map is simply any “two-dimensional representation of something three dimensional.” Paintings, photographs, and even film are included under this definition of maphood, which focuses on the necessary relationship between material and space. Under this definition, Cosgrove’s project would not be a map, due to its material irregularity; nor would Cooper’s, due to its departure from strict spatial representation.
“Etymologically, a map is just a card, a square, a surface,” says VES Professor Tom Conley, now finishing his third book on map theory entitled “An Errant Eye: Poetry and Topography in Early Modern France.” This definition, however, fails to capture the full realm of objects that count as maps. More roughly, he says, a map “is a locative mechanism that induces in its spectator a sense of place, or placeness.” Cosgrove’s and Cooper’s works fit neatly into this more abstract characterization; each project pursues an alternate but viable path towards the evocation of place.
Bill J. Rankin, a graduate student who is writing a dissertation on the transformation of territory and corresponding shift in cartography in the twentieth century, believes maps to be nothing more than a “translation of one set of things to another set.” DNA mapping, for instance, constitutes a form of mapping that has a highly tenuous relationship to any geographical foundation. For Rankin, the verb ‘to map’ is more telling than the noun ‘map’, which carries with it all sorts of unintended connotations.
The list of convincing and intelligent definitions of the concept of maps may be endless; the richness of maps may simply resist clear characterization.
“SNEAKY AS HELL”
What is clearer, and what definitively unites all maps, is their transcendence of mere content in a unique interpretation of the way space looks and functions. “No map is not biased,” says Cosgrove. “You can make any map using only objective facts and it doesn’t matter, you still choose what you represent… any map requires that you eliminate 99% of the information that you could put in.” Just in the content of maps, then, there is already an implicit decision-making process and thus a concrete agenda. The very notion of a concise, legible representation of the world around us is unrealistic; each representation will reflect the subjective priorities of its maker.
Because of the widely held faith in maps’ objectivity, the partiality built into every cartographic item affords an opportunity for unnoticed argumentation. “When someone shows you a map that comes up on a PDA or cellphone, you have no idea how easy it is to manipulate you… it’s really sneaky as hell,” Stilgoe says. He sees the famed Mercator globe as an example of this deception: because of the disproportional sizing of the Northern hemisphere, Stilgoe believes that it “played right into the British imperial plan.” According to Stilgoe, such overlooked psychological ploys can also be seen in the proliferation today of Google maps and Global Positioning Systems. “Nowadays, Americans are timid, afraid of being lost, and want maps that they can wholly trust,” he says. “The graphic design of contemporary maps, including these on board navigational devices, is intended to speak to that timidity and fear of being lost.”
Similarly, says Rankin, maps can be distorted by the agendas of the institutions that commission them. “There is a long-standing relationship between maps and governments,” he says. “For several hundred years, the only people who could afford to make maps were governments.” This fact means that all maps “came pre-approved by the state.” Not only does this mean that maps aligned primarily with the state’s interests, but also that government-issued maps are more often seen as canonical versions. Rankin’s point is most obvious in reference to the standard continent maps that hang in most grade school classrooms. “Every time we draw a map that shows national borders as the most important feature of a map,” he says, “we’re reinforcing certain ideas about the importance of nation-states.”
PLACE AND PEDAGOGY
By analyzing the arguments maps present, one can gain a deep historical understanding of people, states, and cultures. Rankin, for instance, is currently studying the representations of American Indian reservations on maps. “Most maps, road atlases, and school atlases show Indian reservations in the way they do national parks or forests. The state boundaries are primary, and Indian reservations get another color,” Rankin says. And yet, the constitution qualifies Indian reservations as separate nation-states that have a international relationship with the federal government. Showing reservations as national parkland, then, seems to imply that Indians are not autonomous but rather inhabitants of demarcated areas of culture preserved for a sort of antiquarian sensibility. Maps, therefore, provide crucial insight to the psychology of average Americans towards American Indians—and possibly into the reality of those indigenous people themselves.
Conley has used the notion of maps for entirely more abstract purposes. His current studies concern the idea of cosmography and Early Modern French poetry, which he sees as an exercise in the topography of space and language. “This is what poets give us,” says Conley. “They have a tactile sense of the world…[there are] recurrent signs and markers in the abstraction [of poetry] that the perceiver will find and use to plot an itinerary.” Mapping, then, need not take place on the level of physical place; it is also appropriate on the level of emotions and objects. Just as maps are an abstract representation of geographical formations and state boundaries, so too may poems be abstract representations of the contours of human emotion and interaction.
Stilgoe also sees human subjectivity as an inherent feature of maps; after all, he pointed out, “we walk around the subway grates in front of the Holyoke Center and never think about anything, while a woman in heels knows about those grates. We all have little details of things we don’t like, things that are important to us.” In their essence, maps form individual interpretations of space. The very idea that we have the ability to plot out their towns, regions, countries and continents in supposedly definitive images implies that we have a subjective mastery and understanding over our environment, that we understand and triumph over the chaos of nature.
And yet, it is not simply that maps represent this assertion of humanity over its surrounding world. Rather, maps themselves have brought about a definitive change in human understanding. “A lot of the way people experience space is in a sort of mapping space,” says Rankin. “We visualize ourselves as being located somewhere on a map and as we move around the world we think of ourselves as moving around that map.” Their impact on our thoughts and beliefs diverges drastically from the simple supply of information.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time, I was nine years old. I took spelling tests and struggled with long division. After school I would go over to friends’ houses and play with Barbies and Tamagachis. Sometimes, we would listen to music and bounce around. My childhood friend—who was, and remains, much cooler than me—would slip Christina Aguilera’s album into her boom box; shaking our hips to the beat, we would wonder exactly what it meant to be rubbed the right way.
Occasionally, I went to birthday parties at places like Mars 2112.  Aliens would descend upon me; it made me anxious. This was the closest I ever came to a real party until high school.
Flash forward to my junior year at Harvard University. It is Saturday night and I go into my blockmate’s room to inquire as to whether my outfit for the birthday party we’re about to attend (sadly, not at Mars 2112) is appropriate.
“Have you seen it?” asks one of my blockmates, looking at her computer, her eyes wide.
It, turns out to be popular music’s latest gift to the world: Willow Smith’s “Whip My Hair.”
The music video features Smith, the nine-year-old daughter of actor/singer Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, singing/rapping her defensive, angry party anthem which implores all the ladies out there to whip their hair back and forth. Willow Smith, who was recently signed to Jay-Z’s record label, brings color into the sterile, white, presumably elementary or middle school cafeteria by dipping her hair in a boom box that contains red and blue paint and proceeding to whip it back and forth. A dance party erupts as the other children delight in their newfound color.
Smith sports long, tacked-on nails and stick-on crystals on her lips and eyelids.  Her hairstyle appears to change with every setting, as she repeats the monotonous, caustic chorus: “I whip my hair back and forth.” It’s catchy in a sort of assaulting way. While singing, Smith scowls, flips her hand to indicate nonchalance and disdain, and, of course, shakes her head up, down, and side to side.
There is something profoundly grotesque about the spectacle, but I just can’t stop watching. First of all, the song is terrible.  It’s mostly comprised of the chorus, which is monotonous at best, more accurately described as migraine-inducing.
The more one listens to the lyrics, the more perverse and puzzling the song seems: “Hop up out the bed turn my swag on / Pay no attention to them haters cuz we whip em off…I’m just tryin’ ’a have fun / So keep the party jumping,” the nine-year-old sings.
First of all, what swag? Do you swagger on into P.E.? English language arts? Furthermore, what party? The last party you went to at Chuck E. Cheese’s? I don’t go to very cool parties, I admit, but the idea of a pre-teen in attendance makes me very, very uncomfortable.
But wait. It gets worse. “I gets it in mmmm yea I go hard / When they see me pull up I whip it real hard / I whip it real hard, real hard, I whip it real hard,” Smith almost shouts.
Come again? One wonders if Smith even understands the implications of going hard, let alone whipping it real hard. Yes, ostensibly she’s talking about her hair, but the post-pubescent listener certainly isn’t thinking about the singer’s tresses.
Therein lies the grotesque nature of the video.  To spout a cliché, in the age of YouTube and Facebook, it seems as though the concept of childhood is fundamentally changing.  What does it mean for a child to sing about parties and hate, all while flaunting her hair, one of the most obvious signifiers of female sexuality? The child is introduced into the world as sexual object, as mini-adult.  I have a word for this—pedophilia.
But it’s more than that. The video is more than just grotesque, it’s terrifying. Why are we teaching young women that their power comes from their hair and not their minds? I have no problem with pre-teen rebellion, sometimes school sucks and parents suck but a kid just wants to argue back—not become hyper sexualized, not whip your hair back and forth, but talk back. I want angry young women all over the country to use their minds, not just their bodies, to feel powerful.
Perhaps the most terrifying image in the video is when a toddler, dressed in a blue jacket, leggings, and high-tops, who can barely stand up on her own, dances to the beat surrounded by a group of delighted bystanders.  She dons a pink bow in her tufts of baby hair. She too can learn to whip her hair Smith seems to be telling us.
While the sexualization of young women is nothing new to the music industry, Smith seems to have taken it one step too far. While the feminist movement is about taking ownership of one’s body and sexuality, it is also about recognizing that women are more than just their hair. Furthermore, it’s about allowing girls to truly experience childhood.
Even an annoyingly catchy tune can’t hide what “Whip Your Hair” really is—the tune of yet another lost childhood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his peripatetic career as a director, Danny Boyle has traversed the drug-addled backstreets of Edinburgh (“Trainspotting”), a post-apocalyptic future (“28 Days Later”), and most famously, the fairy-tale success story of a boy from Mumbai (“Slumdog Millionaire”). Now, in “127 Hours,” perhaps the grittiest film of his entire career, Boyle has turned his attention, for the first time in over a decade, to realism. The film traces the true story of Aron Ralston, an intrepid hiker who falls down a gorge in Utah and finds his right arm trapped under a rock. Over the next five days—the time period referenced in the film’s title—Ralston (played by James Franco) wages a remarkable battle against the elements and his own fears and insecurities, reflecting in excruciating detail on his life and, eventually, summoning the courage to extricate himself, amputating his arm with a blunt, Chinese-made multitool.
Boyle, 54, says he has always been attracted to stories of extraordinary human courage and suffering, whether of the trapped Chilean miners or the incarceration of the kidnapped Irish writer Brian Keenan in Beirut in the 1980s. “I first heard of Ralston’s story in 2003,” he says, “but while Aron wanted to make a docu-drama, I preferred the idea of a real-time experience film.” He says that the medium of cinema is uniquely suited to convey a story such as this. “When you go to the cinema, you’re trapped in a black box: you’re committed to the film. The only way the audience can tolerate Aron amputating his arm is if they are invested in the film.”
After a decade of fantastical and sometimes dystopian films—in particular his multiple collaborations with writer Alex Garland—it is perhaps surprising that Boyle should turn his attention to such a story. However, he insists that he has never intended to specialize in a certain kind of film. “The studios want you to be a specialist, but I’ve never wanted to repeat myself. That’s a danger with success: it breeds familiarity.” The film required Boyle, always known as a technical innovator, to shoot in specialized ways. “Most of the film was shot in long takes—for instance, a 22 minute talk of James trying to move that rock, and then we edited until we had the perfect footage.”
Boyle is full of praise for Franco: “Unusually for a lead actor these days, he has real variety and range.” Boyle emphasizes that while they collaborated with Ralston at various stages, he wanted this to be Franco’s impressionistic rendition. “I wanted James and the audience to go through the experience together, rather than to exactly portray Aron’s story. Aron read each of this scripts, but this was our version of the story.”
The script itself is notable in that, for the first time in his career, Boyle receives a screenwriting credit. “I’m not a writer, I don’t like writing,” he avers, “But when Simon [Beaufoy, the screenwriter] first heard the idea, he didn’t quite get it, and asked me to write a draft first.” However, he does not intend to write his own scripts again. “Now I can go back to my day job, which is critiquing other people’s scripts.”
Beaufoy, along with producer Christian Colson, composer A.R. Rahman and many other members of the crew of “127 Hours”, worked with Boyle on his previous film, “Slumdog Millionaire”, which garnered Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. The films could not be more different, except in the vibrancy that characterizes all of Boyle’s work, but the director asserts his love of working with a group. “I’m a team player, and like to be surrounded by people who will be honest with me. Success makes people say yes to you, and it’s important to work with people you can trust.”

Corruption, violence, death threats, murder-suicides, and a daring investigative journalist out to set the truth free—“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” has all the makings of a Hollywood thriller. But its attempts to realize the edge-of-your-seat excitement of a blockbuster are lost somewhere amidst a confused jumble of guns, fights, and fast-paced action. What saves the film from being another third-rate flop, however, is Noomi Rapace’s tender, adept portrayal of Lisbeth Salander, which leads to a handful of moments in which all aspects of the movie come together brilliantly.
“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” opens with the surprisingly swift murder of two policemen on a lonely road. From there, the plot takes off, hurriedly switching amongst several tales without giving much hint as to the connection between them. The editing—which cuts from scene to scene abruptly, and pans and shifts between shots confusingly—is as awkward as the storyline, leaving the viewer as disoriented as the bed-ridden Lisbeth.
As the movie progresses, however, there are successful moments. These primarily revolve around Rapace, whose acting endows certain scenes with the clarity and power that the movie otherwise lacks. Though she rarely speaks, her acting conveys both inner strength and pain. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie, for example, is one in which Rapace limps to her bed, sits, and struggles to eat the barely palatable food the hospital has provided. Her face betrays pain overcome by a fierce determination—not simply that of a patient trying to recover, but that of someone who has been hurt deeply and has a plan for retribution. She consistently hints at Lisbeth’s power, though, cloaked in her hospital gown and heavily bandaged, she appears frail. Rapace nails the contrasts that are necessary for Lisbeth’s complex character throughout the movie.
Rapace’s exceptional acting brings the rest of the movie’s elements up with it. The ordinarily shoddy cinematography is more stable in these moments, with each shot focusing on the appropriate spaces and framing just what is necessary. Unfortunately, these moments are sporadic and are not enough to distract from the monotonous, ill-chosen music and the generally inept camera work.
The last third of the film is a marked improvement, as the movie shifts from confusingly alluding to the truth of Lisbeth’s past to the climactic courtroom scene, in which Lisbeth is tried for murdering her father. The trial is captivating, and interspersed with moments of clever dialogue, touching sensitivity, and hope. Here the film finally stops trying to be what it is not—a big budget Hollywood action movie—and slows to a pace that enables it to be interesting, clear, and effective.
“The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” offers little of note in the way of morals or themes. Granted, the film makes some vague statement about the level of corruption in politics and the disgusting abuses of power that it permits. However, these themes have been more successfully handled in other movies.
Rapace’s portrayal of someone who has gone through so much pain gives the movie some depth by presenting an interesting potential role-model—though Lisbeth’s experiences have scarred her permanently, the character provides the audience with a strong heroine. Lisbeth is courageous throughout and does not allow her pain to detract from her determination. Small in size and importance compared to the bad-boy politicians she is up against, the character still commands respect as she faces unimaginable obstacles without hesitation or timidity.
Though far from perfect, Lisbeth’s security in herself and the complexity that Rapace lends to her character present a heroine worthy of admiration; a heroine, in fact, that makes “The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet’s Nest” somewhat worth watching.

Internationally acclaimed Portuguese filmmaker Pedro Costa arrives at the Harvard Film Archive (HFA) this Sunday at 7:00 p.m. to present a screening of his sixth feature-length film, “Ne Change Rien” (“Change Nothing”), a documentary on the working life of French cult-chanteuse Jean Balibar. Expanded from a 2007 short of the same name, “Ne Change Rien” is Costa’s latest feature, and the first since the completion of the Fontainhas Trilogy, a cycle of films about the inhabitants of the titular slum-village on the outskirts of Lisbon, with “Juventude em Marcha” (“Colossal Youth”) in 2006. Those films received unanimous praise for their stark, unflinching depiction of a marginalized underclass of service workers, immigrants, and drug addicts, and the considerable formal innovations—a pioneering use of digital video, chief among them—used to capture Fontainhas in its claustrophobia and the chaos of its subsequent real-life demolition.
Subject matter notwithstanding, “Ne Change Rien” hangs together with the films from Fontainhas in its radical formalism; filmed entirely in high-definition digital video (black and white, transferred for screening purposes to 35 millimeter film stock) in a series of hypertrophied static takes, Costa’s documentary is as much a tribute to his friend as it is a singular investigation of spectatorship and the production of art in modernity.
HFA Director Haden R. Guest, who will introduce Costa on Sunday, characterizes the director’s aesthetic as a central blow to the artificial boundary between documentary and fiction filmmaking. “He represents a post-documentary turn in cinema. I don’t think its been as unequivocally stated and as brilliantly stated as in Costa’s work.” The director typically casts amateurs for his fiction features, Guest adds, whose hypnotized performances—the result of a rigorous personal rehearsal strategy—evoke the aestheticized spiritualism of Robert Bresson, in “a marriage of exquisite beauty and stark, poignant, harsh reality.”
In “Ne Change Rien,” rehearsal becomes an end for Costa in and of itself. During the course of the film, we see Balibar rehearsing in the studio with her band and elsewhere, arranging the smoky, eclectic pop songs that would find their way to her 2006 album “Slalom Dame.” These scenes are intercut with footage of Balibar rehearsing for a production of an Offenbach opera, this with a pain taken and a classical precision that bears almost no resemblance to the crooning on Balibar’s albums. In either case, Balibar rarely ‘performs’ throughout Costa’s film. Costa’s primary interest is in the exhaustive and demystifying process behind performance: the singer’s voice falters, tracks from her band fade in and out, and rarely is a song played completely without an interruption or correction, either from her collaborators or herself. The most lasting images of Balibar playing for a proper audience come at the beginning—a long take of the singer’s face, which seems to float amid a gorgeous ocean of changing light—and whose argument constitutes Costa’s principle target, as he undermines the aura of the celebrity with asymmetrical, depersonalized framing more analogous to surveillance video than the gaze of an adoring fan in the film that ensues.
Nevertheless, the object of Costa’s affection is clear: effortlessly, “Ne Change Rien” is as much a deconstruction of performance and artistic perfection—its closest referent being Jean-Luc Godard’s 1968 feature “One Plus One,” a quasi-documentary using footage of the Rolling Stones as they recorded “Sympathy for the Devil”—as it is a platonic love letter to Balibar. The songwriter and actress exudes a seductive coolness even at her most bored or absentminded. Balibar’s music becomes a metonym: her pursuit of music is Costa’s pursuit of cinema, the notion of whose conclusion Costa seems to assert is merely a construction. Costa imposes this inability to obtain wholeness as a stricture on the viewer: whether near or far, singing or silent, in the spotlight or invisible, Balibar in her perfection is the one we’re waiting for, and the one we never really meet.
“Ne Change Rien” not only reaffirms Costa’s status as world cinema’s most important working filmmakers, but raises the profile of a burgeoning generation of experimental Portuguese directors for whom Costa is the central figure. Recent series at the HFA featuring the works of Miguel Gomes and João Pedro Rodrigues indicate the movement towards a cinematic vibrancy in Portugal unseen since the most productive days of Manoel de Oliveira and João César Monteiro. “Portugal is a marginal place on the map in world cinema, acting productively as irritants; a burr on the saddle of conventional cinema,” Guest volunteers. “It’s only of late that it’s getting the attention it’s deserved.”

Until Saturday evening, millions of paying Cablevision customers in the New York City and Philadelphia metro areas were the unfortunate victims of a two-week blackout of all FOX channels, due to a contractual dispute over rebroadcast rights. Although both the timing and duration of the blackout were extremely unfortunate, we are nevertheless pleased to see that both FOX and Cablevision have stopped their petty squabbling and come to a fair, negotiated solution that will restore service at a critical time of year for millions of Americans. In the future, though, these sorts of disputes can be avoided by having both content providers and cable companies focus their efforts on expanding the role of streamed online video and the Internet space as a whole.
Until this past weekend, we had little evidence that either side was going to make a good-faith effort to negotiate. Both companies had effectively pulled out all of the proverbial stops in their attempts to convince the public of each other's evil. Cablevision, at one point, ran an inflammatory message on loop, encouraging customers to call FOX and complain. By contrast, News Corporation (which owns FOX) openly encouraged affected customers to purchase over-the-air antennas. Regardless of one's position on who was at fault for the original blackout, this catalog of childish retorts does not reflect well on either company. Instead of running flashy public-relations campaigns, Cablevision and News Corporation should have been trying to strike a fair deal the entire time.
The contract dispute has also highlighted a key transition in the global entertainment industry: the importance of the Internet space. At its heart, the dispute between FOX and Cablevision is a battle between two business models (traditional over-the-air broadcasting and "packaged" cable subscriptions). However, over the last decade, a third business model has become very popular, particularly with young Americans—streaming online video via sites such as Hulu. For many Americans, whose careers or families may make it impossible for them to schedule discrete and arbitrarily determined blocks of time to be in front of the television, the online platform offers the most in terms of innovation and flexibility. As such, all of the content providers involved in this dispute should explore various methods of expanding online streaming.
To that end, either the content providers themselves or the Federal Communications Commission must encourage a rapid move to the Internet space and a wholesale restructuring of the entire industry. In the future, cable providers like Cablevision should only be responsible for the physical infrastructure of the network itself, while content providers like FOX should offer paid subscription packages (either online or cable-based) that allow customers to pick and choose from a variety of channels and content. For example, the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network could offer paid online subscriptions that would allow subscribers to have access to the same live coverage as television viewers. Similarly, Hulu, a joint venture between several of the major networks, could expand on its Hulu Plus platform to offer paying subscribers full back-catalog access to its most popular programs.
Of course, such a radical change in a key sector of the economy should not be undertaken without considerable forethought.  However, there are several compelling reasons for the entertainment industry—which is hopelessly wedded to an outdated business model—to move toward the Internet space. Perhaps the most compelling is that it is already losing millions of eyeballs (and advertising dollars) to unauthorized "pirate" broadcasts hosted on overseas websites. By not offering a legal alternative for Americans who may not have cable access or choose not to deal with companies like Cablevision, cable and content providers are losing out on millions of dollars of potential income. The technology to stream high-definition content over the Internet is already in place; it is simply a matter of making that content available to consumers.
A far less-publicized—but equally important—aspect of the blackout was News Corporation's (thankfully short-lived) blocking of Cablevision customers on Hulu. This points to another key issue in the ongoing transition of the communications industry. Cable content providers, in their pursuit of profitability, should not let their squabbles with cable companies spill over into the Internet space. Not only does it violate the basic principles of net neutrality (that all data be treated the same, regardless of its source or content), but it is especially troubling because it creates a perverse system of incentives for both sides of the current dispute. Moreover, as many cable companies are also Internet-service providers, such childish tactics can only have a chilling effect on the industry as a whole.
Finally, as the millions of baseball or football fans cut out of the loop can attest, one particular aspect of the dispute that also needs to be addressed is the role of both Major League Baseball and the National Football League in the Internet space. Although both of America's most popular professional sports leagues have made some efforts to expand their viewership in the online space, they still have not made the full transition to allowing online customers to enjoy the same viewing experience as their television-bound counterparts.
At the very least, the two leagues should expand their online offerings to prevent more and more young viewers from becoming "hooked" on the pirate broadcasts that are easier, simpler, and faster than the various cumbersome alternatives currently offered. For example, one New York Times writer criticized MLB's Postseason.tv product—marketed by both Cablevision and MLB as an alternative to FOX's coverage—as "not, by any means, an appropriate substitute to the broadcast that many viewers in New York and New Jersey are missing." Similarly, the NFL offers no method of legally streaming either regular season or playoff football games.
At a time when the World Series, the NFL season, the midterm elections, and the ever-popular selection of various sitcoms are all competing for airtime, it was particularly inexcusable for what was essentially a contract dispute to deprive millions of Americans of a service that they had already paid for, and for which time was of the essence. We are happy to see this blackout come to an end, and we hope that in the future, similar blackouts will be rendered unnecessary by a digital revolution.

The idea that governments keep some things secret that they shouldn’t seems fair enough; clearly, the knowledge that the Bush administration manipulated evidence of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction was a good revelation. It helps Americans choose whether or not to vote for more people like Bush and warns them to more stringently hold their leaders accountable for what they say. But this doesn’t mean the entire world should know everything the U.S. government does. Some things are kept secret for a reason, and “secrecy” does not deserve to be consigned to a list of proscribed words. Julian P. Assange, editor-in-chief and spokesman of WikiLeaks, seems to think otherwise. He also seems to think he should be the one to decide what gets leaked. The recent release by his so-called “whistle blowing” website of nearly 400,000 U.S. military field reports on the Iraq War—hot on the back of the August release of a similar stash of records from Afghanistan—does nothing other than put yet more lives at risk while maliciously representing as fact every detail of reported rumor and witness hearsay found in the “Iraq War Logs.”
The media’s characterization of Assange as a “whistle-blowing journalist” is unwarranted and falls for his entire strategy. Assange is no such thing: Journalism should be about gathering, editing, and accurately reporting news. Indiscriminately leaking some 400,000 stolen documents, while passing off everything in them as “the truth,” does not qualify as journalism. Real journalism should also be accountable and transparent; WikiLeaks operates by trying to avoid being held accountable in any one jurisdiction. While reports of turning a blind eye to torture and the murder of more civilians are indeed distressing, it is spurious to present initial evidence gathered by the military as incontrovertible fact. Real journalists with experience in war-torn countries have written repeatedly of the extreme difficulty in establishing what amongst the trough of rumors and hearsay actually happened.
Yet journalism appears less and less to be the true goal of WikiLeaks’ actions. Instead, Assange uses WikiLeaks to promote a radical anti-government and overtly anti-American ideology. In a widely reported email exchange, Assange reportedly denied a request for interview on the grounds that “I’m too busy ending two wars.” To accept that Assange is a journalist is to accept his implicit impartiality.
The release of these files cannot do much further damage to the already-tattered reputation of the U.S. military in the Middle East and beyond. Still, this leak provides a mass of information to anyone on the workings and the operations of the U.S. military, including in some cases the names of Iraqi informants. The administration’s continuing inability to suppress these publications only makes America seem that much less reliable an employer and a trusted ally  to foreign citizens.
This is not to say that all information WikiLeaks spreads is bad or particularly harmful. The effort to publish the full report behind a large toxic spill in the Ivory Coast likely contributed to the strength of the victims’ cause, while the decision to release a video of a helicopter killing (later-to-be-found) innocent Iraqis in 2007—widely known as “Collateral Murder”—is hardly an issue of national security. The leaking of 50,000 text messages sent during the 9/11 attacks may have been pretty tasteless yet still far from causing anyone a serious problem today. Even so, none of this is real journalism; much of it simply requires the guts and legal anonymity to publish things that other people won’t.
Assange’s ability, on the other hand, to give away so many classified files, many of which have nothing to do with alleged misconduct, to the globe is not so innocuous—especially considering his remarkable success so far in passing off what’s reported as fact. While undeniably succeeding in his tacit goal of harming the interests of the U.S., Assange is only helping prolong turbulence in Iraq and Afghanistan. This kind of leak—what it does and doesn’t show, how it gets represented, who it harms—is an example of why we need some secrecy more than we need none at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The British government announced drastic cuts in spending over the next few years two weeks ago, and its sweeping action has earned praise from pundits. News institutions and ordinary citizens believe that the government is taking bold and necessary action to pull Britain from the brink of bankruptcy. They are right in one aspect—this certainly is bold action. But the tragedy of the unnecessary British policies is that they will be devastatingly counterproductive: These cuts will cause immense pain for Britain’s poor and middle classes, place the country’s fragile economic recovery at enormous risk, and leave debilitating long-term effects.
Britain most certainly has a budget deficit that is far too high, a consequence of misguided financial planning and a recession that has created steep drops in tax revenue. It does need to deal with its budget problems, but now is certainly not the time to do so. The bond markets trusted Britain enough to let it borrow at low rates even before the announcement of the austerity budgets, which suggest that the concern that companies will not begin hiring or investing until the deficit is cut is nothing but a myth the British government uses to make governmental policy for purely ideological purposes.
These cuts will hit the poor and middle class the hardest. Britain’s government has chosen to make some of the most drastic budgetary cuts in the country’s history. About 490,000 public-sector jobs will be cut over the next four years, creating a considerably larger amount of unemployment at a time when job creation is weak. These are jobs that are often held by middle-class and low-income workers who don’t have a wealth of options in today’s jobless British economy, and cutting hundreds of thousands of jobs will add 3.5 percent to the unemployment rate . In addition, long-term unemployment benefits will be drastically cut, a cruel idea during a recession that has more or less become synonymous with long-term unemployment.
David W. Cameron’s grand plan to replace the cuts in the social safety net is for a “big society” of local institutions and charities to help their follow citizens. But British local governing councils are highly dependent on government funds, and because of these cuts, their viability is in question. Simply put, only the British government can perform the collective action needed to protect its poorest citizens, and these budget cuts will leave an enormous and damaging void in the lives of exactly those people—the unemployed, the poor, and the homeless, who, needless to say, depend on government benefits to sustain their budgets during recessions.
Britain’s policy will not only crush the poor and middle class but will also cause immense damage to its already weak economic recovery. The nation’s GDP grew at a measly 0.8 percent in the last quarter, and there is no guarantee that Britain’s private sector is about to come roaring back: Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Global Resources, predicts that unemployment in Britain will rise from its current level 7.7 percent to a full 9 percent by 2012. Recent Nobel Prize winner Christopher A. Pissarides, an expert on unemployment, has stated that the British government “shouldn't allow unemployment to become entrenched,” adding later that Cameron’s administration is “probably cutting the budget a little too fast.” Echoing those sentiments, Roubini Global Economics agrees, arguing that “growth is expected to moderate further as surprisingly strong construction output is dragged down by government spending cuts.”
During tough economic times, a government should not cut spending—rather, it should increase spending to make up for the demand that is lacking from the private sector. Politicians often rebut this by citing concerns about government spending “crowding out” private sector spending, but this is only an issue when the economy is at full capacity, and there is actually a shortage of loanable funds. In a situation like this one, however, government spending can lead the economy back to growth by making up for the gap between Britain’s full output capacity and its weak current output. A short-term stimulus combined with a plan that reduces the budget deficit after the economy has recovered would strengthen the economy in the short run and in the long run. Instead, Britain has doomed itself to years of anemic growth if not a double-dip recession.
There are fair and contrasting views of what the size of the British government should be and the degree to which it should participate in the economy. In a simple juxtaposition, the Labour faction believes  in a large state that provides many services for its citizens and employs large numbers of people; the Conservative government—as manifested in the Cameron administration—supports a reduced state that plays a smaller role in the affairs of everyday lives. Of course, the Conservative view is a fair viewpoint to hold, but what is unfair is to leave a weak economy at major risk for purely ideological purposes.
During tough economic times, budget cuts are not just silly; they are dangerous.

In a New Delhi village where a staggering 85 percent of women are victims of sex trafficking, the Najafgarh Community Centre is imprinted with the sign of Venus, the symbol for the female gender and for the anti-trafficking organization “Apne Aap Women Worldwide.” On its website, Apne Aap says it runs the Najafgarh Community Centre for the empowerment of women and children, a claim that it makes to donors worldwide. Unfortunately, the striking symbol and the large letters etched below it spelling out “Apne Aap” seem to be the organization’s only mark on the village.
We learned all this when we arrived in Najafgarh this summer with a bold idea to help the villagers transform their situation. After reading about Apne Aap and corresponding with its founder, Ruchira Gupta, we raised $20,000 to fund a vocational training program that would teach the women to sew and provide a sustainable job option as an alternative to prostitution. After an initial $12,000 donation, we received monthly reports from Apne Aap listing names of women and children involved in programs at the Community Centre. Yet we also received desperate e-mails from the community coordinator complaining that Apne Aap was not allocating money appropriately. But in light of the international accolades the organization had been receiving for its efforts to help female sex workers, we were loath to think our $12,000 contribution had been misused, much less that the reports Apne Aap was sending us were blatant misrepresentations. Instead, we hoped this project would allay our exasperation with the sexism and inefficiency we had witnessed on previous visits to the country of our heritage.
Our quixotism was shattered when we finally visited Najafgarh. The “Community Centre” that Apne Aap claims to run is a dank two-room building accompanied by a weathered eight-feet-wide by 10-feet-wide rug placed on the dirt where the children sit. More than half of the children do not attend school, and the informal education “class” for the children has no teacher or curriculum; instead, the kids sprawl themselves on the rug, drawing on slate boards and occasionally chucking pieces of chalk. The vocational training program is a daily sewing lesson taught by a 15-year-old village girl to five of her peers, instead of to the 19 girls and women Apne Aap claimed were attending. The women are completely disillusioned and continue to work in the sex trade. Indeed, after spending several weeks working in Najafgarh, we found that Apne Aap had nearly no presence there, apart from a few foreign interns it sporadically stationed there to “teach English.” Devastated by this farce of an initiative, we contacted the organization to ascertain the fate of our donation. After applying significant pressure upon the organization, we were granted a meeting with the founder, who offered to return $4,000, an offer that remains unfulfilled.
As a result of this experience, we returned to college profoundly disillusioned and mistrustful of NGOs. Apne Aap continues to be recognized as a success in the social-change space; in September, its founder, Ruchira Gupta, was invited to speak at the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting. The misrepresentation of Apne Aap's work is extremely deceitful to donors, because they may come away with a false understanding of how their contributions are used. Moreover, such misleading assertions will continue to set back true progress in Najafgarh, whose reality as a struggling village with extremely poor infrastructural resources is masked by false assertions of impact.
We deeply lament the lack of transparency and integrity in an organization that the social-change community has held in such high regard. Moreover, we fear that this may not be an isolated case. During our time in Najafgarh, we interacted with two other non-profit organizations of questionable efficacy.
Yet to solely blame these sorts of situations on the organization would be to vindicate ourselves from our own burden as donors. Nathaniel Whittemore, founder of AssetMap, recently highlighted that donors tend not to follow or care about the actual impact of an organization. This must change. If they are truly dedicated to creating positive impact, every funding body, grant maker, and donor has an obligation to critically evaluate and seek to understand the social value of any type of donation.
We can no longer subsist on deceit or misrepresentation. At all levels, we need to engage in greater dialogue about what “impact” means, and we need to recognize and not be afraid to discuss failure, while simultaneously working to maximize success. We must focus on honesty, integrity, and transparency if we hope to effect meaningful change.
Despite our experiences this past summer, we are slowly regaining faith in the ability of people to do good. We still believe in the possibility of impact. Nonetheless, in this day and age, a commitment to an ideal of change is not enough. We need follow-through.

Harvard will celebrate its Asian and Asian American communities this week during the second annual “Asian American and Pacific Islander Awareness Week,” a series of events hosted by the College’s different Asian American groups on campus that will express the cultural diversity on campus.
While the Asian American Brotherhood is coordinating the celebration every major student group dealing with Asian or Asian-American life is involved. For example, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association is organizing a panel discussion on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in modern politics.
“This event highlights different facets of our community,” says Athena L. M. Lao ’12, the co-president of Harvard’s Asian American Association.
Cultural events—on everything from tradtional Asian cuisine to modern immigrant life—are a major part of the week’s festivities.
“We are looking to bring our culture to other students on campus,” said Lisa M. Yu, ‘11 one of the co-presidents of the Chinese Students Association. “We are doing an event on the path of Chinese food to America, and how it’s actually more American than Chinese.”
Yu said events such as this highlight the dynamic connection between Asian communities in America and those on the Asian continent.
Last night, the Harvard Vietnamese Association hosted “A Lens on Vietnam,” a screening of four short Vietnamese documentaries exploring topics ranging from traditional art in the village of Sinh to juvenile delinquency and the Vientamese criminal justice system. Two of the directors whose films were being showcased were in attendance, and one who could not attend the event answered questions from the audience via Skype.
Amy N. Vo ‘12, co-president of the Harvard Vietnamese Association, said that events like last night’s screening highlight the great diversity of Asian cultures that are lumped under the general term “Asian American.”
“When you think of Asian American, you tend to think of East Asians as opposed to Southeast Asians” Vo said.
The week also helps to raise awareness of some problems that members of Asian communities on campus face.
“This week is very important to celebrate because I don’t think we have much of an opportunity to challenge stereotypes” says Lao.

The Harvard University Employee Credit Union was robbed last Saturday at 10:47 a.m. by an unarmed white male, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s log.
Harvard University Police Department revealed that the robber took $8,372 in cash from the Credit Union.
The robbery was a “quiet process” and no one was injured, according to Thomas Montilli, vice president of marketing at the HUECU.
According to Montilli, the robber—who wore a mask, baseball cap, and sweatshirt—went straight to the counter, gave the teller a bag, and demanded that she empty the cash register. The teller complied in accordance with bank provisions meant to protect employee safety.
“He left without incident and got into a car that was waiting on Mount Auburn Street,” Montilli said.
The bank, which usually closes at noon on Saturdays, did not reopen after the robbery.
Officers from HUPD and CPD searched the area for the person without success, according to the HUPD police log.
This was the second time that the Credit Union has been robbed within the past year. Last December, the bank saw a similarly quiet robbery in which a man demanded cash in a letter he handed to the cashier and fled with an undisclosed amount of money.
In response to the robberies, the bank put together an internal task force to “review different procedures and options,” according to Montilli.

The Undergraduate Council has committed to lobbying the Department of Athletics, the Office of Student Life, and the Boston Police Department to allow kegs at future Harvard-Yale football tailgates.
The legislation, which the Council passed last night, comes in the wake of last month’s announcement that kegs and hard alcohol would not be allowed at the 2010 tailgate. The College first banned kegs at the Harvard-Yale tailgate in 2002. While the Council did not begin acting early enough to change the policies for this year’s Game, the legislation places the tailgate question as a future priority for the committee, said UC Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12.
According to Dunster House representative Annemette H. Harnes ’12, a sponsor of the legislation, the Boston Police Department remains the largest barrier in the efforts to allow kegs at tailgates at the Harvard Stadium. The legislation requires the committee to spend next spring working on a report that will examine other Boston universities’ relationships with the Boston Police Department in preparation for their lobbying of the police in the coming months.
The act, co-sponsored by EAC Chair Jackson S. Salovaara ’11 and the chairs of the Quincy and Dunster House Councils, cited concerns about the environmental impact of cans and bottles, the effects of the keg ban on alcohol consumption, and the potential monetary savings of kegs for House Councils.
Ebrahim said that the Council has worked with the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services in the past on the issue of kegs, and added that the college administration has been generally supportive of lifting the ban.
“We’re going to end up buying the same amount of beer,” said Colin J. Donovan ’11, a co-chair of the Quincy House Council and a co-sponsor of the bill. “I don’t think people are going to drink less if it’s in a can than if it’s in a cup.”
Although it remains unclear what exactly the savings would be if House Councils could buy kegs for the tailgate, Harnes estimated that the kegs could save a few hundred dollars per house. Harnes, who is active on the Dunster House Council, said that a successful lobbying campaign would permit Houses to devote more money to decorations and food for the tailgate.
“Not allowing kegs is a financial burden for HoCos and doesn’t really present any serious safety benefits,” said UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11. “We’re looking at this from a sensibility point of view.”

Over the past year, private, nonprofit four-year colleges reported a 4.5 percent increase in their tuition rates, raising the average private college tuition—including room and board—to $36,993 per year, according to the “Trends in College Pricing” report recently released by the College Board.
Public four-year universities charged 8 percent more in in-state tuition and fees, bringing the average in-state tuition with room and board to $16,140.
At the same time, universities across the nation have awarded increased financial aid packages to students, enabling families to cope with the unprecedented increase in college expenses, according to the College Board’s “Trends in Student Aid” report.
While the last five years have seen a dramatic increase in tuition rates at both state and private nonprofit colleges, increased funding from government financial aid programs—including Pell grants—and from educational institutions have made a college education more accessible for students. Moreover, the average tuition—after taking inflation, grants, and federal tax benefits into account—has actually decreased over the last five years, the College Board reports.
“In 2009-2010, students got $28 billion in Pell grants, and that’s $10 billion more than the year before. When you look at how much students are actually paying, on average, it is lower, after adjusting for inflation, than five years earlier,” Sandy Baum, the lead author of the reports, told the New York Times.
Harvard University has exemplified similar trends to those shown in the reports. The University increased its tuition and fees by 3.8 percent this year, bringing the total cost to $50,724 per year. With the intention of keeping a Harvard education affordable, the University increased need-based awards by 9 percent this school year, bringing the total annual financial aid awarded by the college to $158 million.
“Harvard remains committed to a fully need-blind admissions policy that will enable us to continue attracting the most talented students, regardless of their economic circumstances,” said Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
More than 60 percent of undergraduates at Harvard receive financial aid packages, with an average award of approximately $40,000.

Christopher Greenslate, co-author of “On a Dollar a Day,” described his month-long experiment in which he limited his daily food budget to one dollar and encouraged increased discussion of the origins and costs of food at an event hosted by the Food Law Society at Harvard Law School yesterday.
Greenslate, a high school teacher near San Diego, said he undertook the project after a complaint about rising food prices during a grocery store visit led him to reflect on the travails of people who have little money to spend on food.
In September 2008, he and co-author Kerri Leonard each ate only a dollar’s worth of food per day, forcing them to subsist on items such as oatmeal and beans, with a dollop of peanut butter as an indulgence.
“This is not anything I ever intended,” Greenslate said, explaining that what began as a blog-documented personal curiosity led to him being contacted by The New York Times and ultimately publishing a book about his experience and the issues that it illuminated for him.
Greenslate also addressed policy issues in his talk and even made specific pleas to the Harvard Law School students in attendance to take action on matters such as transparency in the food industry.
Greenslate was invited to the Law School by the Food Law Society, a group approved last month that was founded by third-year Law School students Michelle S. Ahmadian and Nathan A. Rosenberg to increase attention to food issues.
Rosenberg said that he thought Greenslate’s comments on policy were an especially valuable aspect of his visit.
“It’s important for law students to realize the impact they can have,” Rosenberg said.
First-year Law School student James R. Tager also said that it was “really refreshing” to hear Greenslate address not only the need to examine one’s individual behaviors, but also the importance of using one’s education to create change on a broader scale.
First-year law student Lara N. Berlin said she found Greenslate’s emphasis on self-awareness important because “people of means” are often not conscious of the significance of the food choices they make.
Greenslate said that people should start with a self-study to assess their own awareness of the personal choices they make about food.
He recommended beginning by asking oneself, “Why do I eat what I eat?” and “Is my behavior in line with my values?”
“I want people to know that you really are in control of your food choices,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years after millions enthusiastically pulled the lever for Barack H. Obama, voters will return to the polls today to cast ballots reflecting their opinions on the first half of the president’s term.
While Harvard professors agree that Obama has since combatted an unprecedented combination of political and economic challenges, they offer varying degrees of approval of the president—and accordingly hedge their predictions of the results of today’s elections.
Professors are nearly unanimous in predicting that Democrats will lose the House when tomorrow’s votes are counted. But they maintain that the extent to which Republicans win now-Democratic congressional seats will strongly indicate how voters feel about Obama’s success in rebuilding the economy, reforming health care, bridging political divisions, and addressing race relations.
TACKLING THE RECESSION
In the face of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, professors say that the Obama administration’s efforts to rehabilitate the economy have been largely successful, despite facing the partisanship that has plagued Congress.
“The Obama administration’s policy accomplishments...have been very significant in the economic domain, including the stimulus package, financial regulatory reform, and health care policy,” writes Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert N. Stavins in an e-mail.
Government and Sociology Professor Theda R. Skocpol also commends the Obama administration’s successful efforts to pass economic reform, especially “in a highly polarized political system.”
Other professors, however, offer a slightly less glowing assessment of how the administration handled the financial crisis, but recognize that tension between Republicans and Democrats in Congress limited the president’s actions.
Jeffrey A. Frankel, a professor at the Kennedy School, says that the economy needed twice as much stimulus—though he adds that a stimulus package that size would have been impossible to pass in the recent discordant political environment.
Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, a professor in the government department, says that the cost of the stimulus bill and the administration’s spending will contribute to the “massive bumping” of Democrats out of office that he predicts will occur in today’s elections.
JUMPING OFF A CLIFF
Though health care reform sparked heated debate and partisan fighting that lasted for months, professors agree that the Affordable Care Act signed into law on March 23 was ultimately a success.
“It’s a historic step forward in American social policy,” says Skocpol, who recently published a book on health care reform.
Obama’s efforts to make health care more accessible, to decrease the number of uninsured, and to improve the quality of care were impressive, says Robert Greenwald, director of the Law School’s health law and policy clinic.
But in the eyes of other professors, the process of ushering health care reform through Congress encountered many roadblocks and political bickering that tainted Obama’s record in his first two years.
According to Kennedy School Lecturer Elaine C. Kamarck, making health care the top priority on the agenda was risky from the start.
“I think that [the Obama administration] didn’t understand that bringing together the left and the right meant agreeing on an agenda,” Kamarck says. “The agenda they ran with was in fact not at all an agenda that the Republicans were interested in, and that was health care.”
Mansfield put it more bluntly, saying, “Democrats jumped off a cliff” with health care reform because it was unpopular with the American people at the time.
The health care act also faced resistance because of the general population’s lack of understanding about the bill, says Nathaniel G. Butler ’68, who has worked in health care—including the state Medicaid program—for 30 years.
Most of the population has been deceived by Republican distortions of the reform bill, Butler says.
“Government takeover of health care? This is not a government takeover of health care. But people have been led to believe that,” Butler says.
A NATION DIVIDED
Obama campaigned on the promise of bipartisanship, and he was elected with a vision of a unified America.
Yet in Obama’s first two years, Congress has become even more mired in party politics.
Karmarck says that the president’s partisan choice of placing health care reform on top of the agenda has only led to political division and contributed to the birth of the recent Tea Party movement, one of the most potent forces in this year’s election.
“Those [Tea Partiers] were people worried with spending,” Karmarck says.
The movement—which targets large federal spending bills like the stimulus and health care—has attracted hundreds of thousands, by some estimates, and might be potentially fueled by wider disdain.
“At heart, the Tea Party movement is an expression of the desire of a certain slice of American society that wants to take back for themselves the America that they believed once existed—to take it back from the coalition of ‘liberal elites’ and people of different ethnic and racial groups,” Kennedy School Professor Alexander Keyssar ’69 says.
In his victory speech after the November 2008 election, Obama tempered the Democratic Party’s “great victory,” by promising to accept the congressional and presidential gains “with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.”
But health care reform—a feat that many professors acknowledged was a wide-ranging revolution that had proven unachievable in previous presidencies—passed Congress without a single Republican vote.
“They’ve just said no to everything,” adds Frankel, referring to Republican members of Congress. He notes that the disagreement between the political parties extends beyond health care.
Frank questions whether the president was so naive that he believed Republicans would cooperate with Democrats or whether Obama thought that Republicans would cave under public pressure to consider Democratic policies. “Because, right now, people are blaming the Democrats as much as the Republicans.”
Frankel maintains that Obama has made “clear efforts to work bipartisanly...but you need to have a dance partner to dance.”
THE BLACK WHITE HOUSE
The belief that Obama’s critics might be motivated by certain prejudices has inspired some discussion on the effects of having the first black president in the White House.
“On race, I think Obama is more constrained than any white president would be,” writes Law School Professor Michael J. Klarman, a renowned scholar on issues of race and the law.
Given that a number of Americans regard Obama as “the other,” Klarman says that the president seems to be restricted in addressing “some of the racial difficulties facing the  United States today,” as he might be labeled “the president for black people.”
“I think that’s a terrible shame, but I think it’s the political reality,” Klarman says.
As an Illinois state senator in 2004, Obama captivated America with his speech in favor of a nation that is unified—racially and politically.
“There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America; there’s the United States of America. There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America,” he said at the time.
Since that speech, Obama has attempted to stay away from mediating racially charged disputes, only intervening when directly prompted by critics or the media.
Yet professors agree on the significance of having a black president in the White House.
“I think he has changed the landscape, although it’s too early to begin to see,” Keyssar says.
Obama’s imprint on history will not only rely on his being the first president of color, professors say.
“This a guy who took control of the jetliner when it was in freefall,” Frankel says. “In the first six months, he brought the nose up, and now he’s brought it rising up again.”
“You have to go back to at least to Roosevelt or maybe even Lincoln to find a president who’s taken command with a country in such a set of circumstances and performed so spectacularly,” Frankel adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Americans across the state and the nation go to the polls to cast their votes in an election that pundits say will likely reflect a widespread sense of disappointment with the Democratic Party.
The Massachusetts gubernatorial race between current Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, a Democrat, and Republican Charles D. Baker ’79 has been particularly close, drawing President Barack H. Obama to campaign for Patrick in a state usually considered a Democratic stronghold.
The latest Real Clear Politics poll average shows Patrick leading by 4.5 points with 44.3 percent of the vote, Baker trailing at 39.8 percent, and independent candidate Timothy Cahill third with 8.5 percent. According to the latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of likely voters, Patrick leads by just 2 points with 46 percent of the vote, compared to 44 percent for Baker and 6 percent for Cahill.
“People are angry, and when people are angry they tend to vote against the body in power,” said former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, who continues to follow local politics closely.
Two years ago, Obama won Massachusetts easily with 62 percent of the vote. Earlier this year, however, the state elected Sen. Scott P. Brown, a Republican, as its junior senator.
“People are out of work and, notwithstanding Obama’s best intentions, if you’re out of work, you really don’t want to know the details,” DiCara said, adding that he believes that the economy and job creation are the most important issues in the race.
Baker told the Boston Globe that his top goals for 2011 are to reduce the sales and income taxes, abolish the alcohol tax, cap pensions, enforce tougher immigration policies, change business regulations, order a hiring and pay freeze, and ban project labor agreements.
Patrick’s top goals for 2011, as shared with the Globe, are to create jobs, reduce health care costs, reform education, address youth violence, and “continue to govern at the grass roots.”
DiCara said he believes that Patrick will ultimately win the election. He predicts that Patrick will win by 4 points, winning 46 percent of the vote to Baker’s 42 percent, close to the Real Clear Politics poll averages. He thinks Cahill will garner around 12 percent of the vote.
Despite the polling numbers, Baker’s campaign remains optimistic.
“We’re feeling very good about our chances,” said Baker campaign spokesman Rick Gorka. “Voters are anxious for a change, and they know Charlie Baker is the only candidate who has turned anything around.”

Along with the typical Yale-bashing, tailgating, and general revelry, this year’s Harvard-Yale football game will also feature an army of vuvuzelas—a South African instrument whose loud buzzing monotone gained international attention at the 2010 FIFA World cup.
Last Wednesday, Eric M. Cervini ’14 and Johnathon H. Davis ’14 launched the Silence Yale Campaign, a campus-wide effort to distribute hundreds of vuvuzelas to fans before The Game.
“During the upcoming Game, Cambridge cannot afford to endure the noise pollution produced by so many whining Harvard rejects,” according to the Silence Yale Campaign’s website.
Cervini and Davis cited the need to avenge Yale’s 2004 prank at the Harvard-Yale Game—in which Yale students distributed pieces of colored paper to Harvard fans that, when raised together, spelled out “We suck”—as one of their primary motivations for their new vuvuzela campaign.  According to the pair, the special-edition horns will be used to overwhelm Yale fans during fight songs and kickoffs, and volunteers would be stationed in the stands to help coordinate vuvuzela calls.
“We will make our presence known,” Cervini said.
So far, students have latched on to the opportunity to brandish a Harvard-Yale vuvuzela, which is crimson-colored and emblazoned with “The Game 2010” on the bell.   Over 200 vuvuzela orders had already been placed as of noon yesterday.  And while the majority of vuvuzelas will go to freshmen, Davis and Cervini said they have received orders from all of Harvard’s twelve upperclassmen houses.
The vuvuzelas are slated to arrive beginning this coming weekend and continuing into early next week. Davis and Cervini are taking orders for the $8 horns on the Silence Yale Campaign’s Facebook page—www.facebook.com/silenceyale.
The vuvuzela is capable of 127 decibels at full volume, louder than a chainsaw, which clocks in at 100 decibels.  While extended exposure can lead to hearing loss, Cervini and Davis insisted that vuvuzela use at The Game would be very limited in both quantity and duration compared to the vuvuzela noise produced during World Cup matches this summer.
Yale students have already taken note of the new campaign to drown out their cheers at The Game.  “Harvard’s going to need something a lot stronger than $8 vuvuzelas to overpower Yale at the Game,” read a Yale Daily News blog post written on Saturday.
But with the Silence Yale Campaign in full swing, Harvard fans said they were skeptical of Yale’s ability to counteract the blare of the South African horns.
“I think that Yale doesn’t have anything legal that’s louder than a cacophony of vuvuzelas,” Kevin T. Wittenberg ’14 said.
When asked about the Yale Daily News article, Cervini and Davis said they were unfazed and unconcerned.
“We found it really entertaining,” Davis said.

Partisanship in Washington has become so exaggerated that it prevents transformational and innovative policies from being put forward, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough said at an Institute of Politics panel last night.
As part of the panel, entitled “The Midterms and Beyond: The New Way Forward,” Bloomberg and Scarborough described their opinions on the current American political system and the best way to improve it after today’s midterm elections.
Scarborough, host of the talk show “Morning Joe,” and Bloomberg blamed the news business for polarizing American politics. But they also decried the fact that many politicians often dismiss any idea coming from their opponents.
“There is no monopoly of great ideas,” Scarborough said.
Bloomberg added that even though people might disagree with Obama on a lot of issues, they should wish him to succeed because it is in the interest of America.
Susan Milligan, a former Boston Globe journalist who is an IOP fellow this fall, said she agreed with Bloomberg’s and Scarborough’s comments about partisanship.
“I have covered the White House for 27 years, and I have never seen such dysfunction,” she said.
But Scarborough said that the shifting political winds could soon change the partisan dynamic.
He said he was confident that the likely shift to a Republican House and possibly Senate after today’s elections would improve the situation by encouraging collaboration between both parties. With a Democratic president in the White House, neither party will be able to enact legislation without compromise, Scarborough explained.
“I think great things are going to happen, but it will require people to move together and put the partisanship behind,” the former congressman said, adding that Obama would be faced with a unique opportunity to redefine his presidency after today’s elections.
“I want to see the Barack Obama that made me tear up,” Scarborough said, referring to a speech by a more idealistic Obama during his presidential campaign.
Eric Lu ’12, chair of the IOP survey committee, said he enjoyed the insight on American politics that the talk provided.
“I am always impressed with how much Bloomberg knows about national issues,” he said, alluding to persistent rumors that the mayor is considering a presidential run.
When asked if he was considering running for presidency, Bloomberg dismissed the prospect.
“I’ve got a better job,” he said, before advising students interested in public service to consider running for the leadership of a large city, which he said is a great way to make a concrete difference in people’s life.
Yesterday’s talk will be featured on Scarborough’s show this Thursday.

In a meeting yesterday, the Cambridge City Council voted eight to one to rescind two paragraphs of an ordinance passed Sept. 27 that many alleged would lead to an increase in obtrusive corporate billboards by increasing the height limit for signs.
The decision was a response to a petition drive led by the group Save Our Skyline, which had collected enough signatures—15,535, of which 11,461 were certified by the Board of Election Commissioners—to force the Council to either rescind the controversial part of the ordinance or put it on a ballot for voters to decide.
After a month of debate about whether the ordinance actually relaxed signage regulations, many City Councillors said they were willing to move forward by rescinding the provisions concerned.
“It is not the most important issue [for Cambridge citizens,]” said Councillor Marjorie C. Decker. “It has become a distraction. It’s time to move on and start over.”
Although the City Council eventually conceded to Save Our Skyline’s demand, it had accused the group of resorting to “misinformation and exaggeration” in its campaign to gather signatures.
In its petition campaign, Save Our Skyline had argued that the ordinance would lead to an increase in “billboards.” But Vice Mayor Henrietta Davis said that the Council had voted to prohibit signs higher than 90 square feet, a size far too small to be considered a billboard, which she said would be at least 288 square feet.
“I am not going put my tail between my legs on this issue,” said Mayor David P. Maher.
Although he voted to rescind the provisions in question, he insisted that the group had misled some Cambridge citizens into signing the petition.
Echoing the mayor, Cambridge citizen Sean D. Hope said his mother and grandmother were scared by the prospect of what Save Our Skyline called a “corporate takeover.”
“The combination of misinformation and fear-mongering effectively misled members of my family to sign a petition which they did not support,” Hope said.
But Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that some members of the Council were not well-informed on the issue, either.
“If we aren’t 100 percent accurate, and we certainly weren’t in this case, I found it difficult to fault [Save Our Skyline],” Kelley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
For the first time in his second go-around with the Dartmouth football team, Buddy Teevens has four wins in a season—and the campaign is just over half over. So when perennial powerhouse Harvard came to Hanover, N.H. last weekend, Teevens and his Big Green had a chance to make a statement. With a rowdy Homecoming crowd in the stands and the game aired on NESN, Dartmouth could have cemented its role as a team to watch. But instead, the Crimson came away with a dominant win, and Teevens is now faced with the task of making sure his team—currently 1-3 in Ivy play—doesn’t let up in the season’s final three games. Here’s what he had to say after the game.
What Teevens said: We were on the field an awful lot in the first quarter and the first half. They had 60 plays to our 24, so it was tough to get anything going. Harvard's a good football team, very physical up front. We've been getting some movement up front, didn't get quite what we would've liked, and we're facing second and eight, third and eight, and usually we've been third and three, third and four. Our third down conversion [rate] was 1-of-9, so really did put ourselves in a bad situation.
What Teevens meant: Teevens got right to the heart of the game here—Harvard’s defensive line was able to pressure quarterback Connor Kempe and tailback Nick Schwieger in a way no other opponent (and that includes Penn) could. The stat that most people will point to is that the Crimson was able to sack Kempe, who had been sacked once in Dartmouth’s first six games, four times on Saturday. Kempe was also forced into throwing a season-high three interceptions, and many of those came on poorly-placed throws that were rushed because he was being hurried by the defense. But Harvard also held Schwieger to a season-low 69 yards rushing (although the tailback sat out the fourth quarter with a minor injury). The Crimson’s defense came to play, and it stopped the Big Green dead in its tracks.
What Teevens said: We're closer. It wasn't what it's been in the past [against Harvard]. I thought we competed hard. Obviously we have tremendous respect there—they've won so many titles of late. Coach Murphy and his team, they come and they're always ready to play, and I thought it was a different approach this year than what I've seen in the past from my guys. And they had the confidence that they could go out and execute, and they feel worse now, because we let some things get away.
What Teevens meant: Dartmouth came into the game having lost 12 of its last 13 against Harvard, including dropping the last six contests. But the Big Green came in with a bit of swagger, sitting at 4-2 with a real chance to make some a move into the middle of the Ivy pack. Sure, Dartmouth did play better than it had against the Crimson in the past, and had things gone a little differently—if Foley Schmidt hadn’t missed a 40-yard field goal, or if Michael Reilly hadn’t dropped a catch in the endzone—it could have been a real game. But the game never felt that close. Even though Dartmouth has made some big steps in the right direction, it’s still a long way away from a powerhouse like Harvard, and the Big Green’s losses to 4-0 Penn and 3-1 Yale prove it further.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the game on Saturday against Harvard, Dartmouth junior quarterback Conner Kempe had been spoiled with great protection in the pocket. He had been sacked just once all season, avoiding tackles behind the line of scrimmage for 24 consecutive quarters. But this all changed once Kempe and his linemen were introduced to Crimson senior defensive tackle Josué Ortiz.
“Josué is a key part of our team and our defensive line,” said senior defensive tackle Chuks Obi. “He’s very destructive at the line against any offensive lineman. He’s one of the most remarkable [players] you have out there. He’s strong, he’s fast, but most importantly he’s versatile. He just creates havoc out there.”
A second-team All-Ivy selection a year ago, Ortiz’s dominant form led Harvard’s defense in an unrelenting attack that trampled over the Big Green offensive line for the entire game on Saturday. With the start of the first quarter, it was clear that Ortiz and his teammates had come to Hanover, N.H. strictly for business. By the end of the game, the Crimson defensive corps had registered 56 tackles, four sacks for a loss of 24 yards, and three interceptions to hand the Dartmouth offense its worst outing all season.
Ortiz twice accomplished what both Penn and Yale failed to do once against the Big Green. Ortiz claimed two sacks for a combined loss of 17 yards, despite being double-teamed by offensive linemen for much of the game.
Ortiz’s first sack of the game came at the most opportune time for the Harvard defense. In the third quarter, the Dartmouth offense marched down the field in just under four minutes to reach the Crimson 17-yard line. The hosts seemed poised to score until on a crucial third down, Ortiz sacked Kempe for a loss of eight yards to push the Big Green back to the 25-yard line. With this sack, Ortiz had robbed Dartmouth of a relatively manageable third-down conversion and replaced it with a fourth-and-long situation.
On the next play, the strong pass-rush efforts of Ortiz and his teammates this time resulted in an inaccurate pass by the Big Green quarterback that sophomore linebacker Bobby Schneider intercepted.
Ortiz’s second sack was less vital but still caused a long third-down attempt that the Big Green ultimately converted. This brought the senior’s season sack total to five, good enough to lead the team along with junior defensive end Benjamin Graeff.
Ortiz has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments, especially in the last couple of years. Last season—his first year with extended playing time—Ortiz was a breakout player despite not starting a game.  Ortiz led the team with nine tackles for loss while also adding two sacks to his season total.
As a starter this year, Ortiz’s staggering performances on the line of scrimmage, especially against Dartmouth, have only reinforced his image as a very capable defensive end. But in light of his talents, Ortiz remains humble and is driven to continue improving.
“As a defense, including myself, we were able to make a couple of big plays that helped us win the game against Dartmouth,” Ortiz said. “But overall we still have a lot of improvements to make, especially for myself. There were a couple of times where I missed a tackle, so there is certainly room for improvement for myself and also for the rest of the defense, and that’s something that I will work on for the rest of the week.”
With Harvard approaching the most critical point of the season as they face Columbia, Penn, and Yale, one thing that remains certain is the level of tenacity Ortiz will bring to the field. In addition to his competitiveness, his leadership, experience, and success have garnered the respect of his teammates.
“I think he’s a great guy,” Obi said. “He’s got a great personality, he’s very strong-willed, and he’s a guy that a lot of the younger guys look to as an example. He works hard in the weight room and especially on the football field, and it shows through his performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three weekends of rather limited action, the Harvard sailing team took part in two of the most competitive regattas of the fall, as both the co-ed and women’s squads set out to qualify for their respective Atlantic Coast Championship regattas taking place later this season.  That is precisely what each team was able to accomplish over the two days of competition, with each squad finishing with matching third-place finishes.
“We were able to qualify for [the Atlantic Coast Championships] in two weeks down in Florida, and that was our main goal this weekend,” junior crew Alexandra Jumper said, “so we were very happy with our performance.”
The women’s team placed third at the Victorian Coffee Urn regatta—hosted by Connecticut College—to earn their ticket to the Sunshine State for ACCs the weekend of Nov. 13–14. The co-ed squad, meanwhile, will be heading to Annapolis, Md. in two weeks to compete in ACCs thanks to a third-place team finish at this weekend’s Erwin Schell Trophy regatta.
A rookie Crimson co-ed contingent also competed this weekend at the Nickerson Trophy regatta, taking 12th out of 15 teams.
ERWIN SCHELL TROPHY
The Harvard co-ed squad finished with a third-place effort in a field of 18 teams this weekend at the Erwin Schell Trophy regatta. It was the 70th anniversary of the event hosted by the Coast Guard Academy and served as the qualifier for the Atlantic Coast Championships later this season.
“We had been in second for most of the regatta but ended up in third for the weekend,” senior John Stokes said. “But that was alright because we still qualified for ACCs.”
A trio of Crimson seniors, skipper Alan Palmer and crews Quincy Bock and Meghan Wareham, combined to finish third in the A division of racing, with three victories out of the 18 races held this weekend.
“There was a good breeze and somewhat shifty conditions out there this weekend,” Stokes said. “The wind got up to 18 to 20 knots, so the conditions were kind of weird.”
Harvard had six sailors contribute to a fourth-place finish in the B division of racing, as Stokes served as both skipper and crew for the Crimson boat in the division at different times during the weekend. Captain Tedd Himler also fulfilled the skippering duties in the B division as the winds started to pick up on the second day of racing.
“We were able to utilize the strength of our team in the B division,” Stokes said. “We pretty much sailed all of the combinations we could in the B division because that is what the situation called for and it is a sign of our team’s great depth. However, we still need to continue to work on our starting techniques and race management tactics as we prepare for ACCs in two weeks.”
WOMEN’S VICTORIAN COFFEE URN
The Harvard women took third place out of 18 teams this weekend at the Victorian Coffee Urn regatta held in New London, Conn. The tournament was also an ACC-qualifying regatta.
The junior duo of captain skipper Emily Lambert and Jumper finished second in the A division of racing, finishing in the top two in half of the 12 races in the division.
“We were able to take all of the practice and time we have put in so far throughout the season and capitalize on it,” Jumper said.
Four Crimson freshmen, skippers Caitlin Watson and Morgan Russom and crews Louisa French and Isabel Ruane, combined to finish ninth in the B division, with one first-place finish in the ninth race of the weekend.
“We had quite a number of freshmen compete this weekend as we were trying out different combinations, and the freshmen definitely stepped up to the plate,” Jumper said.  “It was great for our team to be able to do well in interesting conditions with very shifty winds as we get ready for ACCs.”
NEW ENGLAND FRESHMEN CHAMPIONSHIPS, NICKERSON TROPHY
Skipper Ames Lyman and crew Alice Kenney teamed up to finish 13th in the A division of racing at the Nickerson Trophy, the New England Freshmen Championship regatta where Harvard placed 12th out of 15 teams this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first test of the 2010-11 season, the Harvard men’s hockey team was able to keep up with the visiting Swedish Under-20 team in an exhibition game at Bright Hockey Center last night. Sweden took the contest by a 2-1 count.
“For a team that hasn’t played a real hockey game really until tonight...I thought there were a lot of positives,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. “That’s a very skilled hockey team—up and down the lineup, probably as skilled a team as we’ll play this year, and I thought we did a lot of good things.”
Harvard dominated the pace of play in the first period, including an outstanding shift midway through the frame where the Crimson kept control of the puck in the offensive zone for a full 40 seconds, generating a number of shots.
“I think our play was really good starting from the first period,” assistant captain Kyle Richter said. “We controlled the play a lot in their zone, which we wanted to do, threw a lot of pucks on net early, and I thought our pressure off our forecheck was very good.”
But it was Sweden who got on the board first. Just under 14 minutes into the period, Johan Sundström took a shot from the slot that goalie Richter turned away. But the puck wound up on the stick of Dennis Everberg, who beat an out-of-position Richter to light the lamp.
Harvard continued to generate good offense throughout the remainder of the first half, finally breaking through in the last minute of play. Sophomore Alex Fallstrom, a Swedish native, drove towards the net from the right side. Though he whiffed on the first shot, Fallstrom put the puck on net, and the rebound bounced out to junior Ryan Grimshaw in the left circle.
Grimshaw launched a high shot past Johan Gustafsson and into the back of the net to tie the game at one. Sophomore Marshall Everson was credited with the secondary assist.
The second period was a bit of a different story, as Sweden dominated play in a frame marked by nine penalties. The Crimson had three power-play chances in the first half of the period but only got five shots on goal.
“I once had a coach tell me that first a power play has to look like a power play before it can start to score goals,” Donato said. “I thought it looked like a power play. We have to generate more shots, more rebounds, and that’s something we’ll get back to the drawing board [with].”
Harvard then committed five penalties in the span of less than eight minutes.
After a cross-checking penalty on Brendan Rempel with 7:30 left in the period, Sweden set up camp in the Crimson zone. Richter stood tall through an initial barrage of shots, but near the end of the advantage, Ludvig Rensfeldt let off a shot from near the top of the left circle that got over Richter’s leg and into the back of the net. Nils Andersson and John Klingberg assisted on the score, which came with just under six minutes to play in the frame.
Harvard dug itself into a pair of 5-on-3 holes late in the period, but solid play from Richter and his defense—particularly junior Peter Starrett, who made a few key blocks in the crease—kept the Swedes off the board for the rest of the period.
“I felt good,” Richter said of his play. “The guys really helped me out with seeing the pucks. Especially on the penalty kill...we did a good job of clearing guys out and clearing rebounds out, which makes my job a lot easier.”
The Crimson bounced back to play a solid third period, but its power-play struggles proved costly in the end. Harvard had two power plays in the final five minutes but couldn’t light the lamp.
Junior Daniel Moriarty had some of the best looks in the closing minutes, hitting a pipe with four minutes to play and putting a well-placed shot on net with 2:46 to go that needed a wicked glove save from Gustafsson to keep it out of the cage.
Harvard opens its season officially on Friday at home against Union.
“Union’s a top-20 team right now,” Donato said. “They’ve played eight hockey games and played well, so it’s a great challenge for us, but I do think that our guys are excited.”

Last weekend’s Rally to Restore Sanity/Fear at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., generated a slew of media attention. Around 200,000 people, including this Flyby correspondent, gathered to hold ironic signs and, despite the turnout, managed not to cause a ruckus.
”Everyone was really calm,” said Anastasia N. Roda '12, who attended the rally.
The huge mass of people present made it almost impossible to hear or see anything without being directly in front of the stage, but that did not dampen the event’s carnival atmosphere.
A large number of people wore costumes, including a robot with a sign that read “Toasters United Against Teabaggers.” There was even someone offering psychiatric help for five cents.
Those who attended the rally echoed estimates quoted in news reports that put the number of spectators in the hundreds of thousands.
“At one point, some of my friends picked me up. Looking down the mall, you couldn’t see the end of the crowd,” said Roda.
“We all came not knowing what to expect,” said Benjamin B. Wilcox '13. “We didn’t know if we were making a political statement or seeing a comedy show.”
Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert went out of their way to play with this ambiguity, as most of the show consisted of jokes about current affairs and references to the rally. For example, Colbert estimated the crowd size at 6 billion just after emerging on the stage in a pod similar to the one used to rescue the Chilean miners—and in typical Colbert fashion, he was wearing a stars and stripes jumpsuit.

Stressed out? Harvard Smiles is here to help.
This new website is a one-stop shop for mental health resources at Harvard, founded by Harvard’s student mental health liaisons. It hopes to raise awareness on these issues and to foster a supportive community, according to the website.
In addition to providing news and information, the site offers options for peer or professional counseling. And the founders of the site said that they are concerned with more than just academic stress.
“It’s geared towards issues of mental health more generally,” said Seth A. Riddley ’12, the director of the project.
In light of incidents such as the Sept. 18 suicide on the steps of Memorial Church, Riddley said that these issues represent an ongoing concern for students.
“The press coverage created a climate where people are definitely looking in the direction of these things,” said Riddley, referring to on-campus mental health resources.
However, he said he felt that the general trend is positive.
“People are becoming more and more aware of issues of mental health,” he said.

Be nice to that overeager Gov 20 section guy, for like many on Congress’ current roster, he may someday take the well-traveled road from Harvard to the Hill.
Harvard has graduated more members of the 111th Congress than any other university, according to a recent article in U.S. News & World Report. Fifteen members of the current congressional roster boast a Harvard undergraduate degree, including Barney Frank ’62 (D-MA) and Al Franken ’73 (D-MN). Many others hold degrees from HBS or HLS.
Yale, Stanford, and UCLA follow Harvard in number of degree-holding congressmen.
All in all, 95 percent of today’s lawmakers hold at least a bachelor’s degree. About 8 percent of the 533 members of the current roster earned a degree at an Ivy League school, according to the U.S. News & World Report.
But despite the quantity of Harvard degrees on Capitol Hill, some members of Congress are questioning the quality of a training program that sends government workers to the Harvard Kennedy School for its Senior Executive Fellows program— a course that costs taxpayers more than $18,000 per enrolled employee.
The Kennedy School offers more than 25 open enrollment Executive Education programs. The government spends about $5 million a year on Harvard training programs, according to the article. Total money spent on high-level executive training by U.S. organizations approached $2.8 billion in 2007, also quoted by the article.

The newest installment of On Harvard Time highlights the humorous and memorable incidents of the fall semester so far. This edition tackles Peretz, Parents Weekend, and the new “anti-final-club club.”
During a segment on the Marty Peretz scandal and the subsequent social studies walkout, the OHT hosts humorously excused Peretz’s remarks, blaming them on the professor’s “Peretz Syndrome.”
The hosts followed the segment with some “Peretz Syndrome” outbursts of their own.
The funniest clips of the show come when one OHT correspondent interviews some clueless freshmen parents—visiting for Parents Weekend. While many of them attended their children’s lectures, they were unable to speak intelligibly about what they learned.
Parents remarked on how the combination of texting, skyping, phone-calling, and e-mailing kept them in almost constant contact with their offspring. However, one parent voiced concern about her son joining “one of those ‘special places.’” We know she meant a final club, but her naivety was far too precious.
With surprise Swedish Fish appearances popping-in throughout the episode, OHT wraps this show up by showcasing poking fun at the campus’ new anti-final club organization.
But don’t take our word for it. Check out the new episode of On Harvard Time.
