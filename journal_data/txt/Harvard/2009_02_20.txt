After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dr. Thomas Michel ’77 considers himself the leading accordionist among the deans of Harvard Medical School. During the summer, the Dean of Education at HMS, specialist in cardiovascular medicine, MCB 234 professor, and multi-instrumentalist (piano, violin and accordion) takes his talent to the streets of Harvard Square. One might have spotted Michel last summer playing Klezmer music with Ted Sharpe ’76, a computational biologist at The Broad Institute at MIT and an amateur fiddle player. Michel and Sharpe are not the only street performers who boast an impressive resume of academic credentials and musical training. Street performers around Cambridge and Boston defy the stereotypical perception of performers as glorified panhandlers. Many of them are at least college-educated and have a range of other careers available to them—from teaching to designing software. They choose the street because it affords them the opportunity to share their art and provides them with instantaneous contact with audiences.HARVARD STREETThere were 275 licensed street performers in Cambridge last year, according to Julie Madden, Director of Community Arts at the Cambridge Arts Council (CAC). The CAC gained jurisdiction over the street performing scene in the mid-1990s, making Cambridge one of few cities to have a formal street performer program; even though the city of Boston now permits street performing, there is no established organization that oversees the newly legal practice. For the price of $40 and the time it takes to complete a short application, almost anyone in Cambridge can turn the city streets into his or her own stage. “We don’t do an audition,” Weeks says. “We want to make [the program] as broad as possible. Anybody that professes to be a performer is entitled to be in public space doing their thing.”Even some Harvard undergraduates are taking advantage of the Square’s welcoming atmosphere.“I’m actually surprised that there aren’t more students that street perform. I think it’s a great opportunity we have,” says Matthew H. Coogan ’11, a classically trained cellist who was introduced to the Harvard street performing scene as a child. “I feel satisfied feeling that I’m contributing something to the Cambridge community.”Coogan and his performing partner, violinist Nora K. Ali ’11, are only two of a group of students that street perform. Ari J. Kriegel ’11 has juggled for the Cambridge community, while Felice S. Ford ’11 plays the ukulele on Church Street. Anna M. Resnick ’09 also holds a street performing license from the Cambridge Arts Council, and Robert S. Yi ’10 just purchased one this week.A CLASS ACTCoogan decided to join this vibrant forum for public art the summer after his freshman year. Then, last summer, he invited Ali to join him, and the two took their Bach and Mozart duets to Brattle Square. “I had always wanted to try it kind of as a joke,” says Ali, who also performs for the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra, the Pops, and the Mather House Chamber Music Society. “I would say ‘Oh, I want to try to perform in the street and see how much money I could make’ and when Matt asked me if I wanted to play with him I got excited because no one ever seriously asked me to play in the street before.”Ali and Coogan found success in Brattle Square, earning as much as $50 for one evening of performing, but they were also confronted with unexpected challenges. After their first performance, the two had learned that scoping out a favorable spot in the Square was a competitive sport, bringing extra sheet music comes in handy when a crowd gathers, and especially for Coogan, performing on the street renders one much more vulnerable than when performing in a concert setting. But Coogan grew to enjoy the challenge of attracting an audience and plans to play more often. This spring he hopes to expand his street performing repertoire by adding folk music.“I had people walking by and [I was] not knowing what they thought,” Coogan says. “It really took getting used to. When people did stop, it was really gratifying. In recitals people pay attention because it’s customary.”Not only did Ali and Coogan win over the crowd, they also gained the support of the management of Bertucci’s, the restaurant in front of which they performed. The manager was so pleased with the clean cut duo and their classical repertoire that he often gave them free dinners and offered them the opportunity to come play every evening in the prime Brattle Square location. But performers with less high-brow acts have received less amicable treatment and certainly no free meals. David Johnston, a Brattle Square regular who plays acoustic guitar, complains that he has been experiencing ongoing clashes with both Bertucci’s and Hidden Sweets. While the management of Bertucci’s declined to comment, owner of Hidden Sweets Mike Braverman described his relationship to street performers as cordial. Still, Johnston feels that the store managers disregard his artistic contributions. “They [Bertucci’s manager and Hidden Sweets’ owner] were ganging up on me saying nobody wants to hear us and that we’re being too loud,” says Johnston. “A lot of people assume that if you’re playing on the street you’re not any good.... I have a band, I’ve made recordings, I’ve played in clubs, and I have had a CD reviewed by the Boston Globe.”BROTHER BLUE IN CRIMSON LANDIn addition to the common misconception that street performers are not talented artists, it is also easy to assume that they are uneducated. Looking at Dr. Hugh M. Hill ’48, who sports glasses with blue-tinted lenses, a blue coat and a blue beret both accessorized with large, metallic blue butterflies, one would never guess that the sash across his chest that reads “Brother Blue: Storyteller” could also list a number of his academic accomplishments. Brother Blue began his street performing career as a Harvard undergraduate in the 1940s, telling stories in the Square. He has the credentials of a University professor, including an M.F.A. from the Yale Drama School and a Ph.D. from the Union Institute. Brother Blue also served as the storyteller in residence at the Harvard Divinity school from 1974-1976. Now a member of the Cabot House Senior Common Room, Blue takes time to lead several workshops, including a weekly storytelling class at the Episcopal Divinity School on Tuesday nights.“I’ve studied with some of the greatest minds in the world,” Blue says, “but they didn’t satisfy me.”Blue felt his desire to have a vast outreach was better served on the streets than in a university setting. Instead of pursuing academia he followed what he identifies as a calling to reach out to those in need through storytelling. “I was anointed before I was born, to come here and change the world,” Brother Blue says. Blue took his message of love and kindness into prisons during the 50s as part of his doctoral work with the Union Institute and continued to spread the word to all who would listen while he stood barefoot on sidewalks in the Square. Brother Blue will tell you the story of how the universe was created in the Blue Period, a time before the possibility of time, and is willing to give a rendition of King Lear in under five minutes. In fact Brother Blue sees the ability to capture the crowd quickly as essential to street performing.“Just to hold a crowd for five minutes is a miracle. You’ve got to be great,” says Blue, who has performed in storytelling festivals from Russia to South Africa. “Overseas they say I’m the greatest story teller and poet they ever saw.”NOT JUST BUSKING FOR A BUCKMuch like Brother Blue, David Neiman built a career out of street performing after graduating from Brown University in 1981 with a joint degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. Nieman, who was classically trained in guitar, also minored in Music. Considering Neiman’s resume, he is far from a beggar looking for a quick buck. When asked why he started performing, Neiman responds, “I saw someone playing the dulcimer on the Boston Commons while I was in school. It was really the instrument that I fell in love with.”In 1985, the Cambridge resident began his own street performing career playing the same instrument in the same location and soon became a regular among the street performers at Faneuil Hall. He then branched out internationally, playing in Tokyo in 1986 for audiences as prestigious as a Japanese princess. “Your job is to get an audience. Not like on a stage when you pretty much know people are coming to the venue. You have to create the venue pretty much out of thin air,” Nieman says. “There were times it wasn’t working. At times it can be brutal being out there performing....Some people [think] ‘Why is this guy doing this?’ Some people look at street performers as beggars. There is that element. Be that as it may, I performed anyway.”Neiman was able to make a comfortable living from performing music and giving dulcimer lessons for 15 years. Now that he has started a family, his education has proved valuable and earned him a job at a software company.STARTING OVERWhile some buskers perform full-time and others part-time, Michel and Sharpe donate all of their earnings as street performers to Partners In Health.“All I can say is that we’re very glad we have day jobs,” Michel says when talking about the amount of money they have earned street performing. “It’s quite a different thing for those of us with day jobs and the folks who are trying to make a living doing this, for whom I have the greatest respect.”Garnering such respect for street performers in the Boston area has taken many decades of advocacy work. Stephen Baird, one of the most prominent national busker advocates and director of the Community Arts Advocates, has been attempting to increase the prestige of street performing for more than 25 years.  After being threatened with arrest while performing in Boston Commons in 1972,  Baird recognized the need for legislation to protect the rights of performers. He worked to put together the street performing ordinance now used by the Cambridge Arts Council.“I wrote the ordinance to take the licenses from the police to the Arts Council so that the artists were not treated like criminals,” Baird says. Although Neiman and Brother Blue among others were able to establish sustainable careers as street artists, until the 1990s performing for money in Cambridge was legal in only certain locations and at designated times. And despite Baird’s best efforts, there is still a stigma attached to street performing. “You do your show and at the end people come up to you and come to give you money. Five minutes later and you’re a bum again,” says David J. Holzman, a clown with a B.A. in Philosophy from the University of California and a Master’s Degree in Elementary Education from Lesley University. “The new people coming just assume you’re a bum and you have to start all over again.” —Staff writer Bora Fezga can be reached at bfezga@fas.harvard.edu.                                —Staff writer Melanie E.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Visual and theater performance artist William Pope.L is best known for his interventionist public art, including the 2005 installation-on-wheels project, “The Black Factory.” Recently commissioned by the Carpenter Center of Visual Arts to create an installation that incorporates the building, the only North American structure designed by architect Le Corbusier, Pope.L has created a performance piece and exhibition in the Carpenter Center. The Crimson sat down with Pope.L to discuss his thoughts on masculinity, the role of arts in a liberal arts education, and “Corbu Pops,” his upcoming Carpenter Center installation.The Harvard Crimson: Give us an overview of your initial ideas for this exhibit and how the Carpenter Center became its home.William Pope.L: I was invited to do a commission here as part of a series of exhibits at the Carpenter Center. I had three other proposals before this one....my first proposal dealt with how the Carpenter Center is meant to interface with students. I thought, could I do a piece that would circle around all those interests the fact that the student population is very important to this community, as is archive life?I wanted to collect saliva from students of color and urine samples from the white students, to display them, and to let them age over time to see what kinds of information—just by looking at them visually—could they tell us about these populations. But of course we ran into legal problems about owning the DNA of other people.THC: Your visit here included both the opening of the exhibit and a performance piece with Harvard students. How did you want these students to approach this piece?WPL: Their role is to choose, to involve themselves in something that requires something different from them. I expect them to think about what they’re doing, but at the same time I expect them to take risks and to simply allow themselves to be a part of something where you don’t judge right away, because it is different from what one is used to.THC: Since you are both a visual and theater performance artist, how do you integrate these two art forms to communicate your artistic message? WPL: I think that “getting your message across” is a popular expression. What people imply is that when people do something, there is only one message that they’re trying to communicate. In most cases, the reason people have difficulty communicating is because they have more than one intent.People want to can what you do so they can package it for a certain kind of delimited consumption. I understand why that is, but that’s not the way my work operates. I can, however, reduce it to a blurb and that says, “Corbu Pops is a visual and sculptural exploration of modernity, masculinity, and whatever relationship exists between them.”THC: Do you have any advice for how the average Joe, who is interested in looking at art but doesn’t have any formal training, might approach your work?WPL: I think everyone should be interested in the story of gender and in stories about the power of winning and losing. In the battle of gender—at least from the written text that we have available—men seem to be winning a lot...SEEM to be.I’m interested, to be very basic, in “guyness.” What is guyness? What is masculinity? What is the relationship between masculinity and the modern period that we still live in? Forget post-modernism; without modernism there is no post. So how did we get to this thing called masculinity, and why is it so invested in being great? And why is it always building all these monuments to itself?Yet it seems like masculinity is very fragile sometimes. I think all along I was interested in doing something that was social and perhaps pushed the boundaries of what was appropriate. I think Le Corbusier was a very troubled man in terms of his masculinity. For many years until his thirties he was not sure how he felt about women, and he seemed more relaxed when the women in his life were defenseless. Here you have this guy who based his career on monumentality and greatness, yet in some ways his biggest fears had to do with women.THC: You are an artist but you also have the role of an educator. How do you think the creation, practice, and interpretation of the arts should be taught at academic institutions like Harvard?WPL: What I find interesting about the arts in education is creating a healthy suspicion of the status quo. Institutions should create a safe environment where that kind of exploration can be fostered. That doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be a critical assessment of the quality of that suspicion, because not all of it is equal. For me, the arts is all about taking risks and pushing the boundaries of an area: of chemistry, neuroscience, music, theater, or whatever. An artist will perhaps ask a question differently, with a different tone that may allow one to see the problem differently. In some cases, it will ask the question impractically, which I think is of value.I think we make practicality very important in America, and there is a celebration of people who only do things because they make money or because they have results. But many things that humans do do not have a clear result. It’s a fact—you cannot predict that A will result in B. So we glorify this kind of certainty in the face of the lie that we can never have it. The stuff I’m interested in, I just admit that I’ll leave it to the void of exploration. I can’t promise you what the result will be. I can only promise you the commitment to leap.—Interview conducted, condensed, and edited by Monica S. Liu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in 2004, Gwen Stefani made her debut as a solo artist with a posse of Japanese females in tow. Christened the Harajuku Girls, they introduced the American public to a particular brand of the Japanese fashion scene, though its representation was severely skewed. The style originated in Tokyo’s eponymous district and draws upon countless chronological and geographical influences, both aesthetically and commercially—European luxury brands regularly vie for the attention of Harajuku consumers alongside local designers. The potential origins of this uniquely Japanese amalgamation of cultural pressures are currently on display at the Museum of Fine Arts in “Showa Sophistication: Japan in the 1930s,” which is on display until November of this year. The Showa period of Japanese history, which translates to “period of enlightened peace,” lasted from 1926 to 1989 and witnessed a government-sanctioned boom in urban renewal via tourism, sporting, and even fashion. The exhibition utilizes these three topics in order to shift the works into separate but relatable categories. In the 1930s, though Japan had only opened its ports to Western trade mere decades prior, nationalistic ambition generated the impetus to fashion Tokyo after the capital cities of Europe with a hope to rival them in opulence and global status. The campaign included an official bureau of tourism, a national park system, improved transportation, and department stores large enough to include swimming pools and zoos.The entire exhibition consists of paintings culled from the collection of Hosokawa Rikizo, a businessman and avid art collector who founded a luxury hotel at the start of the Showa period. Since the works were commisioned, produced, and exhibited for Japanese audiences, many visitors will appreciate the use of quotations from Frank H. Lee, an Englishman living in Tokyo at the time, in order to address apparent discrepancies and familiarize viewers with the subtext within the images. For instance, a large screen painting of a rooster, lacking in significance to Lee, is explained to be a symbol of courage and strength, especially meaningful in an increasingly militaristic state. A cormorant perched on a rock, seemingly a simple depiction of nature, actually represents a tourist attraction.With 17 paintings and two artifacts, the moderately-sized exhibition attempts to emphasize its theme of tradition manipulated to serve commercial interests, though in some cases the claim lacks evidence. A screen depicting a waterfall is said to represent that nation’s desire for tourism, though the author’s own words indicate only a personal attraction to the subject matter. Similarly, a supposedly symbolic representation of a bamboo forest appears to be only marginally related to tourism, though the plant’s functional and traditional purposes in Japanese history are indisputable. The paintings containing human—especially female—subjects function as the exhibition’s centerpiece. The moga, or “modern girl” was the Showa period’s crucial cosmopolitan. Working in shops, partaking in sports, or purchasing the latest Parisian fashions, these girls make manifest the clash of present and future in images where kimonos are paired with severely bobbed hair. Titles like “A Stylish Beauty Dressed in a Kimono Standing Beside a Decorated Christmas Tree” and paintings of women wearing mid-calf length daydresses and cloches aboard a sailboat resemble a vintage issue of Vogue, encapsulating the feeling of the era’s unprecedentedly rapid Westernization.The works within “Showa Sophistication” capture the unbridled optimism of a nation, yet harbingers of the forties are visible even amongst the characteristically radiant imagery. Two elaborately decorated under-kimonos reveal upon closer inspection that they contain varied portrayals of Japanese military activity among the tourist spots. A stylish female skier on a snowy slope is accompanied by captions describing the 1940 Tokyo Olympic Games that never came to fruition. Though the exhibition struggles at times to maintain a strong narrative, it successfully casts light on an often overlooked, idealistic portion of an otherwise destructive era—romantic images that clearly influenced modern Japanese Harajuku style.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if looking good was so much to ask! Daddy was yelling his lungs up downstairs but I bet that’s because he, like all men, thinks a girl can just get pretty lickety-split.“Well,” I said real sly to myself, “someone has the Easter jitters.” I was back at the mirror, back to that black silk dress with the white cuffs, when I heard him billowing up the stairs with clunks and sighs. By the time he’d opened the door I was seeing how the lime green chrysolite pendant would look even though it hung a little lower than my collar and—“You’re still dressing!” he wailed. “How?”I twirled from the mirror with a big failure of a smile. “Do you think this topaz would look better than the chrysolite? I think yellow suits the black silk more than green would.”“You’re in mourning!”“Well, sure, but—” “But what?” His eyebrows crumpled and he said, “Yesterday I couldn’t even get you to leave the house.”“Well,” I said, twirling the necklaces, “here you are, I’m leaving the house.”“No ma’am,” he said, eyeing my baubly dangles. “Not as a gypsy.” I glared and scoffed all over the place. “Winnie, I’m sorry we haven’t talked about this, but I thought you knew.”“About what?”“Mourning.”“I do. Which is why I don’t want to launch someone else into it when they look at me.”“It’s not your duty—it’s the opposite of your duty, in fact—to be the comeliest woman there.” I heard the horses neigh their assent as Ezekiel pulled up with the buggy.“Need I you remind you, sir, that someone in my position has no real duty.” His ruby face went numb pearl.“Being a dead soldier’s fiancé is no different than being a dead soldier’s wife.”“It’s different to me.”“Well not to me! You’ve been holed up this whole time but I’ve been going to town. I’ve heard how the Northerners talk.”“They talk about me?”“They talk whatever they want. They don’t care about gossiping right in the open. I’m trying to keep you out of that.”Here I probably threw in a little eye roll. “Well, that’s fine, Dad, but how do you think I’ll feel when I see everyone else today, all decked out in their Easter finery while I’m over in a corner—”“You’ll feel like a widow! Because that’s how folks think of you: not as a dead mean’s fiancé, but a widow.”“I barely even knew him.”“Did you know I wanted to leave a quarter of an hour ago? Did you hear me say that yesterday?”“Yes.”“Well, you have one minute, Winifred.”It would have been fine—his slamming the door and all—but that little porcelain canary I kept over my doorway spilled from up top and scattered the ground like your first toss of corn feed. My silk creaked as I stooped to the wreckage. The bird’s beak sat up as tall as you please in the center of its own mess.I couldn’t clean it. I’d never touched it after putting it up there so I certainly wouldn’t now. When she’d bought it for me, Mama had only said, “Now that’s something” as she watched the canary eye me plucky from the palm of my lace glove. (Maybe she explained the one for Quinn better—“pheasants are mindful, just like you”—because he was younger). But Mama up and died before I could ask what she meant and then Quinn followed her out before I could engage his pheasanty powers of perception and then Daddy went and Humpty Dumptied this moxious thing to its doom. I shot my necklace at the dresser as I stomped over the fowl yellow candies.Daddy waited more than a minute. I knew he would. The guilt from all that howling of his was probably tearing him up. And I felt soft until Ezekiel helped me into the back of the buggy and I saw Daddy wasn’t going to say a thing. So as I smoothed my dress I smiled away from him, thank you very much.And furthermore: as we trundled off, I saw just how sweet this moment would be. If we’d left when Daddy wanted, we wouldn’t have caught any of this. The way the fog nuzzled the palmettos’ shingly bark as it slunk to the marshes. Or how Ezekiel yelled to another Negro, “Boy, what you doin’ fishin’ when the Lord’s arose? Get you some doctrine.” It’s true that the Spanish moss, once we were in the forest, would still have teased the horses with its fuzzy pendants, would’ve swathed us in the dusty breaths of its crinkling leaflets.But as we neared the forest’s other side, the curtains of moss began to billow and heave, to snap as they finished snaking. Yes, the air was much heartier than if we’d left when Daddy wanted. Even through the heavy foliage, the air was breezing in savory—fast and chilly for April. And that’s when I laughed at this Carolina Sunday, breathed it in. Maybe some churching would be just my delight.My bottom lifted a smidge as we tore from the forest. I grabbed the front seat as I leaned towards it. Ezekiel must have heard my breathing. He kept his eyes on the road but turned his head towards me. “Could be a soppy mornin’.”“What’s that?”“Rain’ll beat us there, Miss Winnie.”“Hmm?” I inquired with a ready smile. But then I looked forward. Amethyst clouds were digging in from the other side of town. “Oh!” I blurted out like an old man falling out of bed.Daddy looked up as I tried to lean back real innocent. But the glare he shot me was something sharp. Had he known we were in for rain? Is that why he was so crazy about leaving early?Now it was my turn for guilt: if we got to church wet I’d be the Easter Executioner. (And, on a very unrelated note, look significantly less fetching.)I tried, “I’m sorry if we’re running a little behind.” He shook his head. “You could care less about duty, couldn’t you.”“Duty!” I almost died laughing. “I left the necklaces at home if that’s what you’re so tart about.”“Winnie, do you even feel sorry that Trent died?”“Do you?”He tried to gasp but I spit out, “Because we knew him about equal. And that’s to say not very much at all.” “That’s not—”“But, yes, I probably bawled my eyes out solid for the first two weeks.”“Then why aren’t you still mourning?”“’Cause I’ve already done it. And just because I’m sorry for him doesn’t mean I’m sorry for me.”His eyes popped. His whole body turned towards me. “Never say that to anyone.”“What?”“You will not say those words to another person.”Wasn’t now my time to tell him?His eyes kept inflating. “Don’t ever say that again, Winifred.”“Sure,” I said, examining the toes of my shoes. They’d been so chic ‘til last year! War, you ruiner of fashion. He turned and spit to the dust. We went miles without a word.But just when I was checking my hand for raindrops, he burst out, “You don’t make sense, Winnie. The way you’re acting now. It don’t correlate.” Shouldn’t I tell him? I could get it out real quick, like a gun shot: Daddy, I sent a letter to Trent that said I didn’t want to marry him but I don’t know if he got it before he died or as he was dying or after he’d gone up, and, Daddy, I didn’t mind the mourning thing, I just don’t think I can keep it up any longer.I bet I would’ve said all that. Except right then Daddy had to say, “It only took a few days of knowing your mother before I was dumb with caring. We weren’t even courting and I was sick for her.”Now I sure as shooting couldn’t tell him about Trent. My eyes were shut too tight. ‘Cause all I could see was Mama, back at that store. Back at the counter, paying for that canary. Isn’t that strange? I can’t remember any of those wonderful things she said to me every single hour, but I can still think up her paying for that dumb canary. She had the surest smile I’d ever seen.Ezekiel hustled the horses and I finally came to, pretending the sky was clear and pretending to watch it. But I kept thinking of Mama, and when I looked at Ezekiel, I had to wonder if she would have liked that he was free now, driving our carriage as proud as lemons past fields that Sherman had lit up and shut down.

Correspondence is not the way of communication in the 21st century. More and more is said with buzz words and abbreviated slang. It’s getting easier to forget that there was a time when subtle, deliberately constructed letters, ripe with frustration and emotion, were the common form of exchange.Guy Debord lived in such a time. Born in Paris in 1931, he was a founding member of both the Lettrist International and Situationist International movements, and he wrote letters—a lot of them. The SI movement attempted to use art for social and political change. Indeed, SI embraced propaganda—what they saw as “arts as a means”—within and without the organization. Unlike other movements before them, this group aspired towards action rather than the formation of a set of doctrines, resisting the term “situationism.” Their ideology—actively creating “situations” around them, refusing to be taken in by the “dead time” of everyday routine—even allegedly helped spark France’s May 1968 Revolution.“Correspondence” traces Debord’s interactions with other key members of the movement as he worked to create and sustain SI from 1957 to 1960. These letters not only show the behind-the-scenes development of this highly influential organization; they serve as a sort of manifesto, revealing the deliberation required for artistic innovation in this environment.The collection of letters presented in “Correspondence” does an excellent job of shedding light upon the less glamorous aspects of being an architect of culture. When one things of the avant-garde, there is an image of the creative, carefree bohemian that naturally comes to mind. But as McKenzie Wark points out in the introduction to the letters, Guy Debord was as much a secretary as a theorist or an artist: “Deadlines, delays, and debts... Of all the roles he chose for himself, not to mention those assigned to him by posterity, the one that receives the least attention is that of secretary.” Debord’s correspondences reveal a leader who is a stickler for details—more politician than artist. Many letters find Debord nagging the various members of SI for projects that have not met their deadlines, and in many others he catalogues how many copies of a certain article need to go to specifically designated places. There are few letters of great philosophical weight to be found. A typical letter from Debord to the members of SI reads: “Following up to what I wrote to you on 5 February, we need to hurry editing the journal, for which texts should be returned to the printer by March 15th.” For Debord, control of procedure is essential.Debord’s political maneuvering within the organization also becomes clear when his exchanges with various people, addressing the same issue, are viewed side-by-side. While he claims that SI has no need to “fabricate fake disciples,” he is constantly trying to appease and manipulate his colleagues. He often addresses Pinot Gallizio, the elderly, successful painter of the early SI as “Carissimo, Grande e Nobile,” which translates to “dearest, great and noble.” The collection also serves to show his willingness to disown the members when they prove a hindrance to the Situationist movement. Within a month of the latest flattering address to Gallizio, Debord writes to another member that the old painter’s show was “manifestly a reactionary farce.” Through his letters, Debord is presented as unafraid to share with members the issues he is having with others; he comments each time that the addressed member has known all along that the recently expelled member would prove to be trouble.Insofar as SI was essentially Debord’s brainchild, the movement shares its creator’s calculating nature. SI aimed to shock. As Debord wrote; “the element of surprise is essential and will ensure our success.” The falling out between Debord and Gallizio occurred because the latter had ceased to shock his audience. Debord excitedly writes about the possibility of a scandal whenever a new exhibit is being planned. Indeed, SI is cited as an instigator in the fashionable rise of anarchism of the 70s. This behind-the-scenes view of SI captures the irony of birthing a movement with both artistic and political aspirations—the perceived spontaneity of creative drive is inherently contradictory to the labored machinations of political planning. In this way, “Correspondence” shows the struggle to resolve structure with chaos, Marxism with  Surrealism— this is the general project of Situationist International.While “Correspondence” serves to paint a vivid portrait of an artist of the political bent and the ways he brought his movement to fruition, his practical leadership qualities render much of his correspondence patently dull. Many of the letters are laundry lists of tasks that must be tackled by the addressed; at times they can sound like office work rather than the start of an artistic revolution. Nonetheless, “Correspondence” presents a friendly introduction to Situationist International, by virtue of the fact that these letters constitute a portrait of the original Situationist. Through his correspondences, Guy Debord delegates and manipulates those closest to him, he is deliberately creating a situation in the name of great social and political change.

In a time when readers desire fast-paced information and authors vie for 15 minutes of fame, those who pen novels often become names on book covers and photographs on book jackets. Rarely do we hear of unattributed works and anonymous publications in print.John Mullan’s “Anonymity” recalls a time when the majority of books were published anonymously. He reclaims these authors’ private lives from obscurity, awakening afresh their dreams of fame or their longing for privacy and their motives for anonymity that have been forgotten in the intervening centuries.Mullan begins his book by seeking patterns to explain the psychology behind various author’s motives for publishing without attribution. His case studies read like a Who’s Who of English literature—from anonymous authors like Jane Austen, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and Walter Scott to those like Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll) and the Brontë sisters, who used psudonyms. Mullan profiled authors who concealed their identities for social propriety, literary promotion, or mere mischief.Others, like John Locke, were forced into concealment by the necessity to avoid persecution in a time when their writings challenged the prevailing religious or political norms. The authorities of the Tudor and the Stuart eras, failing to uncover these anonymous authors, in turn executed printers.By the 18th century, anonymity became less a matter of mortal safety and more a strategy for marketing. Readers and reviewers were left to speculate on the gender and identity for the author. Jonathan Swift, author of “Gulliver’s Travels,” for instance, went to rather elaborate means to preserve his secrecy. He arranged for the manuscript to be transcribed to disguise the handwriting, and the manuscript was later delivered by an intermediary. Mullan says that Swift’s obscurity “was a kind of self-promotion–an incitement to his first readers to discover his ‘genius’… Sometimes the last thing that an anonymous author wants is to remain unidentified.”Anonymity returned to literature in 1996, once again as a political strategy, with the  publication of “Primary Colors.” The book followed the campaign trail of Jack Stanton—governor, adulterer, and Democratic contender for the American presidency–in short, the real life story of Bill Clinton. Anonymity, in this case, implicitly suggested a narrative candor and incited a media frenzy to discover the writer. It also kept the book on the bestseller list.These thoroughly-researched examples reveal Mullan’s keen eye for detail and his mastery at dissecting and interpreting text.  Through close reading, both of the authors’ novels and correspondences, “Anonymity” offers startling insight into the lives and psychological workings of the writers profiled. Given the academic nature of Mullan’s material, he still manages to ground his literary scholarship in a relatively accessible tone.To reduce complex literary history to straight-forward analyses, however, always carries the risk of over-simplicity. This book should be primarily read as a survey—a case study offering glimpses into the lives of the authors, and not an investigation into historical trends. As such, the author would ideally leave the reader to guess at much of what was behind these trends. Instead, Mullan excels in offering rather disparate anecdotes, that fail to cohere as a whole. Those anecdotes, however, are enlightening stumbles for repetition. Had this book been one-third its length, it would have guided the reader along a delightful journey through history. But 374 pages translates to being told, over and over again, that anonymous publishing may be the result of authorial mischief, publicity-seeking, or genuine need for safety.In the epilogue, Mullan finally admits that no bigger themes may be discovered in the history of anonymity. In the all-too-short conclusion, he writes that this book “is a book about the importance of authors, and about how and why readers need them.”The author, in a sense, is a public entity that is kept alive by our imagination. The true anonymity is not the lack of names on a book cover, but being forgotten by history, being generalized into a mere name. John Mullan’s book, then, rescues the authors from anonymity by giving readers their life’s story, their reasons for concealment. This, I think, is the true treasure in Mullan’s book.

When Asobi Seksu’s breakthrough album, “Citrus,” came out in 2006, it filled a gap in underground music. Loud enough to satisfy My Bloody Valentine fanatics but pretty enough to entice indie pop listeners, the album acquired a large and diverse audience. The band soon developed a reputation for intense live performances fueled by pounding drums and passionate vocals, but listening to their new release, “Hush,” one would find this hard to believe. Leaving rock sensibilities behind in favor of meandering pop musings, Asobi Seksu has transformed into a far less exciting band.Yuki Chikudate, the female lead vocalist, is known for her impressive vocal range, but on this album, she showily displays her talent without varying her style or expressing any real growth since “Citrus.” Her light and airy voice, somewhat reminiscent of Regina Spektor, never seems to descend from the highest octaves. On “In the Sky,” one of the album’s best examples of her limited vocal experimentation, she groups her phrases into short bursts, shooting up the octave over and over as if she was not yet content with how high her voice can reach. Whereas “Citrus” fused dream pop with a healthy dose of punk attitude, “Hush” lacks any type of edge. Despite the occasional pounding drum, the songs never depart from the prevailing dreamy tone, making much of the album essentially indistinguishable. As “In the Sky” fades into “Meh No Mae,” the album reaches its nadir, with the next several songs just as unexciting as the previous. Even when they mix up the formula—like when guitarist James Hanna makes a vocal appearance on “I Can’t See”—any notable differences are enveloped by the overwhelming reverb.“Me and Mary” stands out, however, as a pleasant surprise. This song gives the album a much needed shake awake with its faster pace and more aggressive tone. Cymbal and drum fills propel the song, hinting at the punk-ish attitude and raucous live shows they’ve been known for. Unfortunately, only two other songs on the album convey the same appeal; “Sing Tommorow’s Praise” showcases their shoegaze influences, creating a dense wall of sound rather than an delicate melody, while the volume fluctuations of “Sunshower” allow it to be pretty without being irritating.The band’s disinterest with variety on the rest of the album is nothing short of frustrating. Someone felt the need to include “Risky and Pretty,” the album’s 45-second interlude, as a purely instrumental track with more of the same boring sounds, adding another useless track to the rest of the indistinguishable mess. As background music, “Hush” can be tolerable, even more-so when Chikudate stays quiet or knocks down her vocals a couple octaves, but as rock music the album can’t hold one’s attention.Asobi Seksu fails to take a step forward with their music, and perhaps even ends up taking a step backwards. Their last album, “Citrus,” was a fun and exciting listen; “Hush” is anything but. There are solid segments when the music is muddled, the vocals are so high so often that it become irritating, and there are only three songs on the new album that Asobi Seksu can rock their audiences with. Though their sound can be pretty, it can also be pretty bland, and “Hush” leaves no more of an impression than its title implies.

M. Ward plays the kind of folk music that you could expect from a musician writing and performing out in Portland, Oregon, interspersing his songs with neat guitar licks and elegant pop melodies that bring to mind a cultured city. On the singer-songwriter’s new album “Hold Time,” the bucolic passion that imbues the most moving of folk albums makes a strong presence. On the edge of the soundscape are Beach Boys-esque surf-rock melodies and guitar arpeggios that tumble in like the Pacific surf. “Hold Time” is M. Ward’s sixth solo album and his first since 2006’s politically-tinged “Post-War.” From his debut in 1999, M. Ward has made a name for himself at the national level, bringing his distinctive fingerstyle guitar, lush musical arrangements, and reverb-drenched vocal melodies to a wide audience. In 2008, M. Ward gained even more national attention with “She & Him,” a well-received collaboration with actress and fledgling songwriter Zooey Deschanel. Deschanel returns as a guest vocalist on this album’s second track, “Never Had Nobody Like You.” While she provides a dainty counterpoint to M. Ward’s forceful vocal performance, what really stands out is the songwriting. At first listen, “Never Had Nobody Like You” sounds like a simple upbeat pop ditty. With closer attention, however, the incorporation of disparate musical styles emerges. The instances are subtle: the bluesy snare drum break that gives momentum to the transition from chorus to verse, the folksy vocal melismas that make the chorus downright infectious, and the blissful, gospel-esque vocal solo that delivers the song to its outro. M. Ward’s excellent and intuitive songwriting is the glue that holds these various stylistic elements in harmony rather than in dissonance.On a consistent basis, M. Ward is able to integrate his eclectic instrumentation brilliantly as he does on the album’s best song, “Epistemology.” In the song’s chorus, for instance, M. Ward fields not just a traditional rock set-up with guitars and drums, but an orchestra and a folksy hammer dulcimer. If one listens closely, every instrument can be heard distinctly—the light-speed chiming of the dulcimer, the sweeping musical figures of the orchestra, the tight rhythm-keeping of the rock band—together creating a sublime sea of sound upon which M. Ward’s impassioned vocals sail.  “Hold Time” is less successful when M. Ward tries to combine diverse instrumental sounds into a single song.  The issue that emerges is balance. When each distinct sound is allowed its own room to breathe, the results can be breathtaking. When one dominates, the results are tedious.  There are a number of songs on “Hold Time” where one instrument is prevalent to detrimental effect. The title track, for example, is completely awash in lush but lumbering strings that devour the song’s hammer dulcimer and synthesizer. After a couple of minutes, the song has the same effect as sitting in a lecture hall without A/C on a hot and humid day. It’s stifling and sleep-inducing. “Hold Time” has one other significant flaw: M. Ward loves to record his vocals with reverb. On songs like “Stars of Leo,” everything he sings echoes two or three times. Without a doubt, there are instances where such recording techniques are appropriate; atop the rollicking surf-pop of “To Save Me,” M. Ward’s reverb-heavy vocals help to give the song the expansive, almost symphonic sound that it needs. On M. Ward’s soft folk songs, however, this recording technique can be an incredible ear-sore. One such instance occurs on the unassuming album opener “For Beginners.” All of the instrumentation—the glistening layers of beautiful acoustic guitar and the panflute—are unamplified, giving the song a very mellow and organic feel. M. Ward’s reverb-drenched vocals, unfortunately, feel as alien as bulldozers in an Oregon forest. M. Ward has a fine voice for folk music; why he feels the need to envelope it in reverb all of the time is a mystery. But “Hold Time” generally prevails in incorporating its distinct sonic elements to serve the holistic direction of its songs. What results is a unique, creative, and diverse musical effort with a handful of absolutely wonderful moments. On the chorus of “Epistemology,” M. Ward sings, “…I roll and I tumble, down the long road I stumble, while shooting in the dark as to what’s best.” Although M. Ward does take his occasional stumbles and tumbles on “Hold Time,” he ultimately does succeed in crafting a vibrant album that can excite and captivate.

The path of love never did run smooth. But for Ciara and the now mole-free Enrique, the path is rougher than most could bear. Not them though. Their smoldering good looks match the steamy melodrama of this video, in which the pair portray unlikely but vengeful lovers busy at work destroying the interior of their home. Serene, airbrushed features are contorted as their relationship implodes. Beginning with shots of Iglesias scowling and head-tossing interspersed with scenes where Ciara vogues against a wall, it’s never clear whether the duo are angry or just turned on. The situation devolves into rampant vandalism, with the couple pettishly destroying each others’ prized possesions. Ciara goes for the big ticket items, covering Enrique’s sweet ride with paint and throwing his prized artwork in their pool. Enrique, on the other hand, is content smashing Ciara’s perfume bottles and dropping a pitcher of milk. It seems he’s too busy scowling to put any effort into his vengeance. The violent sounds of this tempestuous break up—glass shattering, shrieks of rage, car alarms—are drowned out by the tepid tune of a rather weak pop ballad. Everything happens in slow motion; the events taking place within the dim interior of Ciara and Enrique’s fictive home seem as though they were transpiring underwater. Objects don’t fall, they float through the air and shatter delicately against the floor. You begin to wonder what the creators were trying to do—are we supposed to take this seriously? In any event, violence has surprisingly little impact when everything seems drowned in silver lighting and dance beats. Such glamorization of violence can be dangerous; don’t let Chris Brown see this video.The images on the video are objectively passionate and tempestuous, but no similar feeling is communicated through the music. The beat is infectious but not irresistible, the images glamorous but vapid. Ciara’s strong voice almost makes up for Enrique’s ubiquitous posturing. Together they are a satisfactory pop duet.—Catherine A. Morris

It’s Miley! That really cute, cool girl who may or may not also be Hannah Montana is treating us to another awesome video. “The Climb” is a super deep meditation on the nature of struggle and how you can learn more from the bad times than the good ones. Also, the video offers us a sneak peek at her new movie, “Hannah Montana: The Movie.” Yay! Enough pre-teen enthusiasm already. “See You Again” may have been inexplicably catchy, but it seems the Miley magic couldn’t stretch to a second song. The hideously extended metaphor of mountain climbing as spiritual growth that runs throughout “The Climb” sits very oddly with the clips from the new movie. These show Miley doing normal teenage things like riding a horse, driving in a car, glaring lustfully at an attractive guy in a cowboy hat and getting very wet jumping into a rock pool. Keep in mind that Miley is 17, so if those last two sound a little creepy, that’s because they are. I would say the video fortunately consists of more than this, but it really isn’t that fortunate. We get Miley walking down a Roman-straight road, getting rained on—ending up wet once again—and somehow finishing up at the top of the Grand Canyon in blazing sunshine. There are also some CGI horses—which kind of resemble the stampeding Gallimimus from “Jurassic Park,” except much lamer—and a bizarre repeating habit where Miley throws a rose, her coat and not one but two boots over her shoulder. Dear Miley: it’s only lucky when you throw salt over your shoulder. And a casual disregard for your clothing doesn’t make you a diva. So, while for Miley it may be “all about the climb,” for us it’s really about surviving to the end of this dirge. Tweenage girls will probably love it. Those creepy guys in your entryway who insist on blaring out “See You Again” every night might even enjoy it. But for the rest of us, we’ll have to hope that suffering really does make you stronger. If so, watching this video is as good as working out.                                                      —Chris R. Kingston

In 2002 …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead (henceforth referred to as Trail of Dead for obvious reasons) released “Source Tags & Codes,” a darling album for indie rock enthusiasts. Since then, their music has been received with less than tepid ethusiasm. Some say that it was because they signed with Interscope. Some say that it was because Neil Busch, bassist and electro-noise maker, left the band. Some say that “Source Tags & Codes” was so perfect that anything that came after it would naturally pale in comparison. Whatever the case may be, Trail of Dead has been in a slump for the past seven years. The latest release from them, however, is a solid effort that combines elements of noise-rock and headbang-inducing guitar riffs, which may just bring Trail of Dead back into grace.“The Century of Self” attempts to capture raw musicality starting from its production process. Unlike the past two albums by Trail of Dead, the tracks were recorded live without excessive editing, and the energy and sincerity that seemed missing in previous albums “So Divided” and “Worlds Apart” comes through.The opening track, an instrumental of two and a half minutes, sets the tone for the rest of the album. The short interlude of noise followed by a crisp piano entrance recalls “Source Tag & Codes,” the glory days, which opens in the same way. The ominous repeated notes on the piano are joined by guitars and a hit of the cymbals, the combination of which then escalate to a mass of sound that is at once harmonious and overwhelming. Just when the threshold is near, it comes back down, daring you to listen again.The longer songs on the album, such as “Iris Unveiled” and “Halcyon Days” are symphonic in scale. “Iris Unveiled,” for example, starts with an upbeat, in-your-face crescendo into a catchy riff, accompanied by lyrics of literally Biblical magnitude: “I have made you in my likeness and I will make you a keeper of my Garden.” While carrying this on for a full song would have made a satisfyingly catchy pop track, Trail of Dead avoids this simplicity. They slow down and draw out the song, adding layers of feedback and flourishes. The layers then drop out one by one, leaving a series of rhythmic, restrained chords, over top of which is a vocal melody that begs the listener to sing along. The chords slow down and fade out, and one would expect the song to end here. Then the tease of the bass and the same upbeat, in-your-face crescendo that jump-started the song returns to bring the track back full-circle.These epic, guitar-driven tracks avoid becoming overbearing by merit of the piano ballads and simpler tracks sprinkled throughout the album. “Inland Sea” stands out for its ability to balance a laid-back rhythm with still complex instrumentation. Equipped with a bright introduction and a catchy chorus, the track “Fields of Coal” is proof that the spirit of straight-out rock is still with Trail of Dead. The album is rounded off by the folksy and acoustic “Luna Park.” The record as a whole works like the song “Iris Unveiled.” Trail of Dead brings the listener through different volumes and speeds, intuiting well, for the most part, when the listener will be tired and need respite from it all and inserting moments of calm piano parts or sounds reminiscent of the ocean. Towards the end of the album, high-energy track “Ascending” interrupts a comfortable string of low-key songs. While for some this may be a welcome intrusion (like the return of the upbeat guitar riff in “Iris Unveiled”), Trail of Dead crosses a certain threshold here that makes the album lose focus and difficult to get through. Nonetheless, “The Century Self” is a welcome return to the high-energy sound that we have not heard from …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead for many years. Reminiscent of the epic sound of “Source Tags & Codes,” while still managing to surprise the listener with its many twists and turns, this album may be the beginning of an artistic renaissance from the veteran rockers.

It might just be the distorted looking glass of the last 20 years, but there’s something about the 1980s and its music that brings to mind the Atlantic City casinos built in that decade. The casinos aspire to grandeur—domed, cream ceilings, great pseudo-classical columns, golden moldings—and yet are undone by the very beginning of paint peel, the first sag of the ceiling, the discolored hint of water damage from shirking on the plumbing. They might have looked good when they were first built, but they were never built to last. The defects were there from the beginning, but they were covered up by young plaster and the excitement of novelty, by the distraction of the slot machines and the desire not to see beyond the superficial dazzle of it all. Now, there’s nothing left to conceal the flaws.And Morrissey, the one-time lead singer of 80s superstars, The Smiths, suffers acutely from this exposed condition. No longer the international sex symbol of his twenties, Morrissey’s sexuality is not the burning issue it once may have been. No longer the ringleader of iconoclastic innovators, he’s the frontman for only his overindulged self. No longer politically relevant, he can pontificate on matters of state all he wants, but the papers don’t really care. The persona of Morrissey has lost its allure; there’s nothing to conceal the insufficiency of his music. His newest attempt, “Years of Refusal,” is overwrought and ill-conceived, the result of a warped ego that has not yet realized its time has come and gone. Morrissey’s voice has morphed into something wholly unsuitable for the roaring guitars that make up his instrumental bed. Like floorboards, driven apart over the years by heat and humidity, there’s a divide between the vocals and the instrumentation. Morrissey has given in entirely to his natural tendency to caramel crooning, and, nearly always stalled in throaty vibrato, sounds more like a second-rate Broadway singer than a rock star. Gone is the occasional roughness, the edge of the lead singer of the Smiths, a thinness that emphasized the honeyed richness of his voice even more. Now it’s incessantly cloying and sickly sweet all of the time. But even as he’s aged, he’s clung to his heavy electric guitars. There’s swirling distortion in “Mama Lay Softly On the Riverbed” that clashes with the vocals and squeezed-in synthesized organ. “All You Need is Me” ultimately manages to harmonize Morrissey’s fussy vocals with the backing guitars, but only after the initially heavy instrumentation is abandoned for lighter fare. Morrissey’s voice, thankfully, never duels with the powerful, profound chords, and he’s free to embellish his autobiographical quips—“I was a small fat child in a welfare house / There was only one thing I dreamed about / Fate has just handed it to me”—with his whole range of vocal contortions. Morrissey’s pseudo-intellectual musings are also somehow unbecoming of so mature an individual. “It’s Not Your Birthday Anymore,” a slow ballad that recounts the harsh words of a jaded man to his soon-to-be-discarded lover (“It’s not your birthday anymore / There’s no need to be kind to you”), comes off as juvenile and pitiless. “One Day Goodbye Will Be Farewell” makes use of end-rhymes that can only be described as puerile: “And the smiling children tell you that you smell / Well, just look at me / A savage beast, I got nothing to see / And when I die I want to go to hell.”And yet, like gambling, there’s something addictive about Morrissey’s new CD, no matter how bad you know it is. Every song seems to have a few bars that hit it just right, as if the old Smiths star shines through the fat every now and then. One of the high points is the chorus of “That’s How People Grow Up,” where Morrissey’s tenor tremors in sync with the sinister riffs. “Throwing My Arms Around Paris” is the one track that makes good use of lyrical pretension in its resonant declaration of lovelorn-fueled wanderlust: “I’m throwing my arms around Paris because only stone and steel accept my love.” These moments keep you listening, like small wins at the craps table. You keep listening because you think you might just win, that Morrissey might all of sudden stiffen his beer-sodden body and pull himself together again into something of beauty. But that’s the problem, because that’s exactly the logic that keeps fooling the AC’s casino clientele and Morrissey himself. They think that, if only they wish, everything will be as it was in the 80’s. But, sadly for Morrissey (and for those of us who would be his fans), that just is not the case.  —Staff writer Sanders I. Bernstein can be reached at sbernst@fas.harvard.edu.

To most people, the Boston Marathon is a race hosted annually by the City of Boston on Patriots’ Day in April. But to a select band of individuals from across the country, “the” Boston Marathon happens in February, and requires 24 hours, not 26 miles, of endurance. Every year since 1976, a few hundred fans have spent one full day enjoying the best and worst of the last century’s science fiction cinema. The festival’s location has changed since the event first began—moving from the old Orson Welles Theatre in Cambridge (which burned down in the mid-80s) to West Newton to its present Davis Square home. And each year’s event has a different theme (this year’s was “Alien Attack”). But the close-knit audience remains more or less the same; there are multiple people who have been to all 34 festivals. For a stranger to the sci-fi community, the overnight festival—which took place this year from last Sunday to Monday—can appear somewhat inscrutable. Little seems to link the bizarre assortment of films, ranging from the most camp B movies of the 1950s (“I Married a Monster from Outer Space”) to new releases (“Chrysalis”) to, perhaps strangest of all, mass-marketed Hollywood fare (“Transformers”). But fans point to the distinctive worldview that sci-fi films provide as a unifying thread through the festival.“I like the positive view of the future,” says Jim Peterson, a 10-year attendee of the event. “Science fiction shows us new ideas.” “It’s meant to be escapist,” says Jen Simon of Philadelphia. “It’s less mundane than normal life.” Simon is on her second trip to the festival; she was introduced to it by her fiancé, Steve Lento, who’s been a regular at the festival since middle school. The highlight of this year’s festival was the recently-released “Alien Trespass.” Directed by former “X-Files” producer R.W. Goodwin, the film pays homage to five iconic 1950s sci-fi films. Any great sci-fi movie, says Lento, “should be aware of and contain genre conventions; ideally, it should play with these conventions or do something new with them.” The self-referential nature of science fiction means that style and an extensive awareness of the genre’s history—rather than substance—separate a good sci-fi film from a merely average one. That’s not to say that sci-fi movies are devoid of meaning or broader concerns. The widely mocked B movies of the 1950s were certainly characterized by tackiness, but they also explored clever political allegory at the height of the Cold War. In luring people back to Somerville year after year, the lineup of films is secondary to the festival’s unique communal experience, a theme that emerges repeatedly in conversations with both male and female audience members. (Contrary to any stereotypes of sci-fi as an exclusively male pursuit, the festival draws at least as many female attendees as male ones.) The festival is a richly interactive experience, with performers and audience competitions (years past have put on costume contests; this year featured an alien mating cry contest) interspersing the screenings. Rick Juskiewicc has been making the trip north from Rochester, New York for 30 years, and now finds himself too old to sit through the entire show. Still, he is brought back every year by the camaraderie of “the Boston Marathon.” Malden resident Darryl Davis, a veteran of 20 festivals, feels similarly. “I come to meet the friends I’ve made that I see here every year,” he says. Even the movies themselves depend on the community atmosphere. “I wouldn’t watch the B movies at home by myself,” Simon says, “but here we all willingly suspend disbelief together.” Given this community, it is no surprise that ties to the festival run deep, and the event is often a family affair. Miriam Dennis of Weymouth has come to every festival since 1986, and has brought her daughter Alex along for the last decade. And while the festival does attract the occasional lone eccentric—such as a self-proclaimed “magician” from Somerville who rotates the names Michael Fishman, Tuna Oddfellow and Fish the Magish—families are perhaps the most common type of attendee. Not all fans are fortunate enough to have cooperative children, however. In his 30th year at the festival, Cambridge resident Barry Perlman lamented his inability to pass on the sci-fi tradition. “I try to bring my children, but they’re too square.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Typically in bloom for two weeks of the year, cherry blossoms have captivated generations struggling to come to terms with the frailty of human life. But despite their transient existence, these harbingers of mortality are a far cry from bleak or empty representations of death. Instead, the obvious beauty of these flowers, no matter how short-lived or delicate, is a testament to those unbreakable bonds worth striving for—love, familial ties, and friendships. German director Doris Dörrie’s “Cherry Blossoms” is a similar reminder to appreciate life’s transient but spectacular moments. This touching film, though at times overstated in its sentimentality, incorporates the evocative power of the plant’s symbolic imagery to encapsulate the experiences of a family coping with an unexpected death. Not long into the film, Trudi Angermeier (Hannelore Elsner) discovers that her husband Rudi (Elmar Wepper) is going to die. Concealing this fact, she convinces him that they need a vacation, but then unexpectedly dies herself on the Baltic Coast. Initially unable to relinquish his grief, the aging Rudi travels to Japan carrying all his money and a suitcase of his wife’s clothing in an attempt to transport her spirit to the one country she had always longed to visit. Once in Tokyo, which takes the adage “the city that never sleeps” to a whole new level of disorienting proportions, Rudi ventures around his alien environment wearing his wife’s sweater and skirt to finally bond with the woman he never appreciated while she was alive. In a similar vein of love and loss, “Cherry Blossoms” is also an especially poignant portrayal of a dying man not only coping with the passing of his faithful life companion, but also reflecting on the slow disintegration of the family structure. Sentiments aside, the direction of the movie, which is set in Germany and Japan, pays tribute to a cross-cultural exchange between East and West embodied in the interaction between Rudi and a teenaged Butoh dancer named Yu (Aya Irizuki). While Rudi travels to Japan as a way of making amends to his dead wife, it is not until he meets Yu that he learns about an aspect of his wife’s life that had previously eluded him. Thus, Butoh’s dancing becomes a means through which Rudi can honor the memory of his wife while abandoning his own personal inhibitions.This seamless melding of contrasting personalities and viewpoints is also manifest in the film’s varied dialogue of English, German, and Japanese. To communicate with each other, Rudi and Yu must abandon their native tongues and speak English, thereby intimating that language is no communication barrier for this ostensibly odd couple. What is fascinating about this burgeoning friendship between a homeless Japanese girl and an aging German man is that the relationship transcends labels—it is neither sexual nor paternal. Instead, these two are spiritual partners in life, sharing a mutual obligation to help each other find beauty in loss while overcoming grief.The success of this film rides on the fact that Dörrie guided what could have been an overtly maudlin disaster into an aesthetically stunning and thematically satisfying piece of visual art. But the movie falters when it begins to show signs of the skewed persepctive that so often characterizes the depiction of the fetishized East by a Western gaze. Though there is no denying the symbolic resonance of age-old emblems—the titular cherry blossoms, for instance, or the impressive Mount Fuji—their prevalence trivializes Rudi’s earnest attempt to reconcile his past wrongs with a renewed love for his wife. As generic and exaggerated symbols, their impact wanes by the story’s conclusion.Succumbing to mortality almost as soon as it reaches the peak of its blooming season, the image of the cherry blossom may be effective in grounding certain larger themes in perspective. Regrettably, in reference to the film’s unique take on a subject already revered for generations, the innovation gets lost in translation.—Staff writer Eunice Y.

“I want to torture people the way they did my family,” proclaims Budi, a young Indonesian boy, at the start of Robert B. Lemelson’s documentary film, “40 Years of Silence: An Indonesian Tragedy.” Such is the sentiment that now prevails over the long silence that followed in the wake of the mass killings which took place in the mid-60s in Bali—deeply embedded anger is passionately released, experiences of discrimination and pain fervently expressed. In a film both moving and disturbing, psychological anthropologist Lemelson explores the lives of four individuals and their families in Indonesia, and reveals their suffering through “one of the largest unknown mass killings of the 20th century.”Produced and directed by Lemelson and edited by two-time Academy Award winner Pietro Scalia (“Black Hawk Down,” “JFK”), “40 Years of Silence” documents the systematic and discreet extermination of an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Indonesians from 1965 to 1966. The killings, which targeted members of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), a then-legal political entity, occurred under the direction of General Suharto at the time of his rise to power. Suharto eventually ascended to the presidency and remained there until 1998. It is only now, a decade after his resignation and 40 years after the massacre, that survivors of the atrocities are finally sharing their stories.The film, which was screened at Harvard on February 12th, was well received by its audience, but also subjected to certain pointed criticisms. Spectators found fault with the film’s lack of emphasis on the involvement of the U.S. government in the killings, and on Lemelson’s portrayal of the PKI’s lack of culpability. The former criticism held that the film ought to have addressed the CIA’s involvement in the atrocities, which included covert support and funding of Suharto’s army. In response, Lemelson stated that the choice to omit that part of history was an “editorial decision,” and cited the limited amount of time allotted for imparting information.The latter criticism contended that Lemelson did not adequately express the PKI’s role in the atrocities of 1965, choosing instead to lay all the blame on Suharto and his “New Order” regime.Of this criticism, Lemelson admitted, “[The film] gives a little bit of a false picture.” Although he is a self-professed “anti-Communist,” he conceded that the film is “soft” on the PKI’s contribution to the extreme tensions in Indonesian society during 1965.Despite these criticisms, however, the film is strong in several areas. The film’s score, which was edited by Richard Henderson (“Borat,” “The Life Aquatic”), is entirely original and complements the intense testimonies of the participants. The use of archival footage and historical commentary is also effective, as is Lemelson’s attention to character development. As one spectator commented, the film does not attempt to “glamorize or create saints” out of the victims. Rather, they are portrayed honestly as complicated people coming to terms with the trauma of their past. In fact, all of the survivors interviewed in the film are struggling with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the social stigmatization that still haunts Communist-affiliated citizens in Indonesia.Lemelson, a professor at the Department of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Sciences at UCLA, began conducting research in Indonesia in 1996 as a Fulbright Scholar, and has continued his work on culture and mental illness there ever since. He learned of the 1965 holocaust through a conversation with a man who had lost his family as a result of the purge. Lemelson said he hopes that the film is eventually viewed by President Obama, who moved to Indonesia the year that Suharto became President. Lemelson believes a public acknowledgement by Obama of the victims’ suffering would serve to validate their experiences. For now, “40 Years of Silence” gives voice to both survivors and victims in an attempt to legitimize a painful history and ensure that the memory of it, once hidden, is not lost.—Staff writer Anita B.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traditionally, the Ivy League has been the early stomping ground for bankers, politicians, and a range of other six-figure professionals. Though it counts amongst its alumni famous names in the humanities and arts, on any campus of the Great Eight you are more likely to find an amateur particle physicist than an actor or actress. Sure, Natalie Portman ’03 shot a few “Star Wars” movies while at Harvard, but she studied Psychology, and the movies trashed George Lucas’ career.The few examples of Ivy cinematic glory notwithstanding, the overall dearth of our representation (at least in acting) in Hollywood is simply because, despite grand notions of liberal arts, these schools teach obsessive compulsive practicality and pragmatism as the highest and most glorious art of all. In our many lecture halls, one must un-learn the practice of risk-taking for that of cozy financial security. Some lucky few though, like Cornell graduate and actress Carla Gallo, skipped those classes on paper-pushing perfection in favor of greater passions. If you’ve watched one of Judd Aptow’s brohiem sagas from the past five years, then you probably have seen Carla Gallo. To jog your memory, she played “Toe-Sucking Girl” in “The 40 Year Old Virgin,” “Period Blood Girl” in “Superbad,” and “Gag Me Girl” in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” More recently you might remember her from Showtime’s “Californication” as Daisy, the utterly endearing pornstar from season two.Having just read this list, you are probably reacting similarly to how I did when I first read her IMDB filmography. I, too, noticed the trend of her roles, but I was intrigued by the fact that she is an alumnus of Cornell. Had this Ivy Leaguer gone bad or just totally nuts? I decided to talk to Carla Gallo herself and put the whole story together.Her acting career began almost simultaneously with her undergraduate career when she was cast in David O. Russell’s first acclaimed film, “Spanking the Monkey,” during the summer between her performing arts high school graduation and her first semester at Cornell. When it seemed likely that filming would conflict with her freshman fall, Gallo’s mother told her, “Over my dead body are you not going to school,” and then promptly demanded Russell be finished with Carla by the start of the semester.“I left the set at 5 am and was at Cornell by 5 pm,” Gallo said. Once “Spanking the Monkey” wrapped, Gallo totally immersed herself in school, majoring in theater and saving Hollywood for after she graduated. “I don’t want to do anything else [but act],” Gallo said, “but I don’t have the fear other actors have because I got an education, I have this degree, and I know if I have to go into another field, I can.” After graduating, Gallo made her Aptow connection, co-starring alongside Seth Rogen in Aptow’s TV show, “Undeclared.”“On ‘Undeclared’ I was actually the only person who had gone to college,” Gallo noted. “Here we are doing this college show, and no one had actually really been, and it was so bizarre to me.”Aptow, not usually known for creating leading female roles, kept his loyalty to those around him at the launch of his career, and has given Carla some of his more memorable female characters (for example, the girl who bleeds on Jonah Hill in “Superbad”). Despite the potential embarrassment that might come with such roles, Gallo has enjoyed greater visibility from these projects. “Now it’s like, ‘Oh! You’re the girl!” Gallo recalls of her more recent auditions.Gallo has also been a regular on HBO’s “Carnivale” (as a stripper) and Showtime’s “Californication” (as a porn star). “Here I am, having gone from stripper to porn—porn actress—and [my friends] are like ‘Why you?’.... I’m not that girl. I’m the girl next door, not the sex symbol.” Gallo guesses her “good girl” appearance and personality on screen creates an interesting tension between expectation and reality. And her sweet-looking, gross/kinky-girl casting has followed her. But exposing it all turned out to be less difficult during “Californication,” leading Gallo to think, “Oh my god, I have lost my mind because I am totally comfortable doing this.”When I asked her how her friends and family felt about her roles, Gallo said that while her friends were excited for her, her family had difficulty adjusting. Her father respected the art of her roles, commenting that he “would much rather that [she] were doing this than be in a bathing suit on Baywatch.” Her mother, on the other hand, “has major problems with [‘Californication’]” and was unwilling to tell other relatives about the racy role right away. As for her future on the show, Gallo said, “I don’t know how long the pornstar who breaks up a marriage gets to stay in the picture. I’m not sure it will be a happily ever after.”Nonetheless, her major role in “Californication” will probably be a springboard for her acting career. She has an upcoming role in Aptow’s “I Love You Man,” though she says going forward, “What I really honestly want is just to be working steadily... I would love to just be on a great TV show and have it run for awhile.”I have to say I admire her dedication to her passion and her commitment to taking the acting leap even after graduating from the pragmatic atmosphere of one of the country’s top schools. No one, except someone who truly loved acting, would ever take the kind of risks Carla Gallo takes when she is on-screen. Whether she is asking to be gagged, sucking Steve Carell’s toe, or baring it all in “Vaginatown,” Carla Gallo is doing the only thing on-screen she ever wants to do: act. And her Ivy background will always be a “badge of honor,” allowing her to be “the oddly funny, and intelligent, porn actress,” with definite emphasis on “intelligent.”                                                         	—Columnist Andrew F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid the shrill chatterings of hurried students rushing to class at the Center for Government and International Studies (CGIS South), the mystical images on the walls of the bottom floor remain placid and vibrant. “Sufism: Mystical Ecumenism,” the exhibition of photographs by Iason Athanasiadis currently on display at CGIS South, includes pieces from Iran, Pakistan, Syria and Turkey. “The exhibit is a visual journey through Bilad ash-Sham, Khorassan, and the Punjab,” says the Harvard Gazette, “chronicling the movement and rhythm of zikr, the ecstatic ceremony practiced by Sufi orders around the Muslim world.”Through the use of photography, Athanasiadis, a photojournalist and former Nieman fellow, seeks to shed light on oft overlooked aspects of Islam, allowing for a better understanding of what has become a world religion intensely scrutinized by mainstream media. The photographs represent Islam as meditational, peaceful, and beautiful.“Sufism focuses on how an individual develops his or her own personal devotion to God,” says Ali S. Asani, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures at Harvard University. “It is about becoming less egocentric and more God-centric.” Walking through the exhibit, this act of personal devotion is plain to see. In one photograph, a meditating man shakes his head passionately. The viewer can tell from his eyes that the man is experiencing mystical elation. Post-9/11, the Muslim world has, by and large, been portrayed in the media in conjunction with politics, international relations, and violence. Images like those described above are rarely seen. “It is so easy to fall back on stereotypes. Images produced and reinforced through movies and other media offer tempting caricatures of the complex world we live in, not just of Muslims but of numerous others in our midst,” says Na’eel A. Cajee ’10, president of the Harvard Islamic Society. “The media we expose ourselves to powerfully impacts us, and it often makes it easy for us to think we know, but we have no idea.” Regrettably, Americans are seldom familiar with the personal elements of Islam. “Muslim societies have been perceived in the media as one dimensional,” Asani says. “But there are many other dimensions, such as art, literature, music and poetry, which create a very rich mosaic rarely portrayed.” This mosaic is what these photographs begin to reveal. “I was struck by how well [the photographs] were selected to portray at least three important themes of peace, passion, and submission. These themes are of course central in Sufi thought, but they are also very important Islamic themes, though rarely ever associated with Islam either by the media here, or by those outspoken violent agents who pull the world’s attention to themselves with their violence and their claim to represent Islam,” says Dr. Sadeq Rahimi, postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.Passion fills the images of meditational prayer or whirling dance. Motion enlivens each image as tresses fly in rapturous movement. Yet despite the perceptible presence of spirituality, the images are personal and human. These people are in simple rooms, often in simple clothes, giving insight into the day-to-day practices of Muslims.Rahimi believes that initiatives such as the CGIS South exhibition allow for a more complete understanding of Islam, which would foster better appreciation of Muslim culture by Western societies. Cajee says that photography and, more broadly, the media can and should be used to reveal similarities—such as religious devotion and prayer—between U.S. and Islamic societies. “People have this politicized image of Islam, but for the overwhelming majority of the Muslim umma [community], it’s simply personal, devotional. These photographs help us to understand what ordinary Muslims aspire to and how similar those aspirations are to any other community,” Cajee says. “Just as the media around us has the power to forge stereotypes, it also has the power to shatter them.”Indeed, because the photographs reject media stereotypes in order to focus on Islam’s spiritual elements, we are able to consider the religion not as constantly problematic but rather as a peaceful way of life. “We can see the complexity, the beauty of the Muslim world. The exhibit highlights the crucial relationship between religious adherence and cultural values and helps us understand both better,” says Paul Beron, director of the outreach center at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. The exhibition has proven an effective way of communicating the crux of Muslim spirituality. But this is just one small step. “Much more needs to be done. This should ideally be part of a larger project at Harvard incorporating the arts as powerful vehicles to foster learning and teaching about cultures that are not properly understood,” Asani explains. “This would be in keeping with the recently released recommendations of the Task Force on the Arts.”“The images are able to emphasize something that is normally absent for typical media reports,” says David R. Odo, Harvard lecturer on anthropology and visiting curator at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. “[But] there is no single form of knowledge sufficient to capture or understand human experience. We need to use many forms. Photography, and indeed the arts more generally, can contribute to this.”Yet even this small exhibition is able to produce a powerful effect for many viewers. Rahimi says, “It is vital for all of us to remember the message of the Sufi, to remember that love is the only way forward, and the only way to peace within or in the world is through a passion for love and submission to beauty of the universe. I think it is a wonderful moment in time for us to go and rediscover the message of love that is the Sufi doctrine, and the media can certainly play a significant role in doing so. There is definitely a lot of joy within Islamic cultures that is awaiting discovery.”

Photographer Peter Vanderwarker relies more on blinding colors than provocative themes in his works of art. From his portraits of prominent Bostonians to his photographs of the city’s architecture and scenic locations, Vanderwarker’s attempt to emphasize the cultural diversity and vivacity of Boston lacks innovation and depth; at the very most, his artistic visions are cliché. “Vanderwarker’s Pantheon: Minds and Matter in Boston,” Vanderwarker’s current exhibition, is on show at the Boston Athenaeum through May 2.
Peter Vanderwarker has developed an intimate familiarity with Boston and its community. Trained in both photography and architectural design, he was a Loeb Fellow at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. “Vanderwarker’s Pantheon” is a continuation of his exploration of Boston as a historically innovative urban center. Vanderwarker strives to relate his vision of Boston’s unique aspects by capturing prominent buildings, locations, and individuals on film. The portraits and architectural photos endeavor to depict Boston in its ongoing development as a commonwealth center of life, culture, and community. However, while Vanderwarker’s intentions are admirable, the way in which he uses photography to document Boston’s growth gives only an unoriginal glance at the city.
The series of photographs of the John Hancock Tower, taken from the MIT Boathouse, are merely flat, frontal views of the building. The pictures present the same, grid-like, glass-windowed Tower; the only noticeable difference is that they are taken with different lighting. The sole creative element of these large, vertically oriented photographs is how they are reminiscent of Monet’s paintings of cathedrals at various times of the day. Otherwise, the intent behind the series is ambiguous, as it seems only to depict a superficially beautiful image of a skyscraper. Such a representation of the Hancock Tower lacks an intriguing perspective as well as a sense of artistic mastery.
Furthermore, Vanderwarker makes even the most familiar, comfortable images of Boston trite. His photographs include the Public Garden in the winter, the Charles River, the grand marble staircase of the Boston Public Library, and Harvard’s very own Sever Hall. Taken in sharp focus, the photographs are intensely colorful. However, this over-saturation of color cheapens the images, making them look like blown-up postcards. The angles and views of the locations are more ‘familiar’ than the sites themselves because they are essentially formulaic. As a result, it is impossible to develop a deeper personal reflection on the seemingly mass-manufactured photographs.
The portraits that comprise the majority of the exhibition depict individuals who have contributed specifically to the Boston community, from painters to University professors to members of the medical community. These people are meant to represent a select cross-section of society. Many of the portraits are displayed one next to the other, some even tangent at their sides. With African American educator next to Asian American pharmacist next to Caucasian judge, the juxtaposition of the portraits strives too obviously to emphasize the diversity and unity of the Boston population. Vanderwarker’s portrayal of these individuals is forced rather than sincere, and the contrivance renders the photographs too idealistic.
Adding to the contrived nature of the exhibition are statements by the individuals depicted in the photographs. While Vanderwarker attempts to inject a personal voice to the portraits, most of the writing sounds like an excerpt from a cover letter. Moreover, the labels seem like product placements; each placard also includes a thumbnail of the logo of the company or institution to which the individual belongs. Because the relationship between the subject and the setting of the photo is exceedingly apparent—for example, a doctor placed against a background of pill containers—there is hardly any room for imagination or analysis on the part of the viewer. While it may have been Vanderwarker’s intent to create a scrapbook of his “heroes,” the lack of creativity and innovation in his execution makes these tributes seem more like enlarged Facebook profile pictures.
“Vanderwarker’s Pantheon” does succeed in capturing picturesque snippets of locations in the city that are integral to Boston’s urban identity, but it fails to convey any inspiring or provocative messages. Overcome by clichéd perspectives and overly deliberated connections, the exhibition is muddled by the cheap, commercial nature of the photographs. While there was no gift shop in the Athenaeum, the museum very well could have shrunk Vanderwarker’s images to sell them as postcards to tourists.

Just over a year ago, stately 19th- and early 20th-century paintings from Harvard’s massive art collection adorned the walls of the main corridor in Massachusetts Hall. Recently, this hallway, which bustles with the traffic of the University’s top administrators and professors, has been decorated with the artwork of current students. In an effort to inject a contemporary feel into the high-profile space and to increase the visibility of student art at Harvard, University President Drew G. Faust welcomed the work of student artists to Mass Hall on February 5. The exhibition, which features the creations of 22 students in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies, showcases the artistic diversity of Harvard’s undergraduate population. “We wanted to give a sense of the range of approaches that students in the VES Department take to art,” says Virginia Anderson, assistant curator of American art at the Harvard Art Museum and curator of the Mass Hall exhibit. “We hoped to display their work in a very public place.”At the hallway entrance, two strategically positioned mirrors refract light from a bent-wire sculpture glistening with museum wax, a substance that drips so slowly that changes to the work are barely noticeable until the next day. This installation gives the illusion of visual dynamism without physical movement. “The piece is in infinite, continuous flux,” says artist Sara J. Stern ’12, who tailored her work specifically to the space. “Transparency, reflection, shadow, and light are all central to [the piece].” Directly across from this sculpture, an enormous charcoal-on-paper piece utilizes traditional sketching and shadowing techniques to capture the versatility of human movement within the artistic confines of a linear plane. A few steps down the corridor reveal equally fascinating creations, from faces with penetrating expressions illuminated against silkscreen backdrops to eight colorful digital animations looping on a video projector. One of the standouts is “Do Rivers” by David L. Rice ’10—a black pen on white scroll paper creation that utilized modern animation techniques to convey what Rice describes as “a sense of restlessness seeking peace, a feeling of being always in the midst of roiling phenomena but sensing, out of this storm, a glimmer of quiet, a possible calming unity.”“Given the extraordinary diversity of the work displayed,” Anderson says, “what unifies the collection is that there is a compelling quality to every piece. You keep thinking about each of [them] even after you have left Mass Hall.” Indeed, each artist employed a unique approach to attracting and holding attention: one student accented a predominantly grayscale portrait with bold green and orange brushstrokes, while another’s imaginative use of materials one might find in a neglected dormitory corner—masking tape, paper towels, red thread, and even human hair—created a hypnotizing, organic mixed media image. The inspiration for the students’ work was often rooted in their everyday experiences as residents of the Cambridge and Boston areas. Emily C. Milam ’10 was on a bike ride down Cambridge Street when she took a snapshot of an interesting intersection in space between a railroad crossing and a flock of birds flying in a perpendicular trajectory. Snoweria Y.K. Zhang ’12, whose digital photography piece captured a little girl’s bored yet pensive expression on a Boston subway, describes the simple story behind her work: “It was pretty fortuitous—I was on the T with my camera, and I thought the scene in front of me would be a good picture, so I took it.” The newfound focus on bringing student art to the forefront of campus life is due in large part to the work of the University-wide Task Force on the Arts, whose December 2008 report included a recommendation that more spaces on campus be dedicated to the arts in addition to broader suggestions for arts-oriented curricular and instructional changes. “We are looking for spaces throughout the campus where we can showcase students’ talent and artistic energy. For me, daily encounters with the student work in Mass Hall have been a welcome reminder of the artistic vitality at Harvard,” says President Drew G. Faust, who initiated the creation of the Task Force in Fall 2007. Kayla A. Escobedo ’12—whose acrylic-on-masonite piece “Leda and the Swan” is an abstract, textured interpretation of William Yeats’ poem of the same name—commented on the University’s recent focus on the arts: “I think what President Faust and the College have been doing for the arts is fantastic, and I deeply appreciate the obvious sincerity involved. President Faust showed genuine interest in the students and their work at the opening reception for the exhibition.” “This push for the arts… is about validating the arts at Harvard as an important part of what the University produces. The Mass Hall exhibit affirms that by putting art in the nucleus of the University,” says Timothy J. Reckart ’09, whose stop-motion animated film “Token Hunchback” in Mass Hall encourages viewers to think about the “ethical status of entertainment careers built on the display of disability,” Reckart says.While the names of these student artists may not yield Wikipedia search results quite as impressive as those of the 19th century artists whose paintings once graced the Mass Hall corridor, their ingenious, meticulously executed work adds new vigor to the administrative heart of the college.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just when I was starting to get used to the passionate debates that characterize meals in Annenberg, a recent dinner conversation threw me a curveball. Last week, I had the unique—and frustrating—privilege of dining with the last individual on earth who does not believe in global warming.
Or so I thought. Further research indicates that my acquaintance was far from alone; according to a 2008 Gallup poll, about 11 percent of Americans still think that global warming “will never happen.” (Within the scientific community, this statistic is only three percent.) Perhaps most disturbingly, the study reports that 13 percent of Americans believe that no further climate control measures are necessary—in other words, that we as a society should take no action to further reduce carbon emissions or attempt to combat global warming in any way.
Whether these “unbelievers” remain unconvinced due to differing interpretations of the data or mere apathy, their stance is not only untenable, but also dangerous. Though it’s easy to brush off such wrongheaded beliefs in our relativistic culture, those who think global warming is a hoax are not simply another case of mere “difference of opinion.” These people are gambling the welfare of the entire planet on the off-chance that the majority is wrong.
Evidence that the average temperature on Earth is rising is abundant and convincing, but I suspect I would be preaching to the converted if I were to summarize it here. The bottom line is that the scientific community has come to a clear consensus that the evidence of a warming trend is “unequivocal” and that human activity has “very likely” been the main cause for that change over the last 50 years.  It is thus troubling that one in five Americans remain unconvinced by the vast majority of the scientific community that we have an immediate obligation to change our behavior and to protect our planet.
Beyond the scientific evidence, one can support a plan of action that reduces carbon emissions based on moral considerations alone. In an article entitled “Perspectives on Environmental Change: A Basis for Action,” Professor Michael B. McElroy of Harvard’s Center for Earth and Planetary Physics cites Pope John Paul II’s opinion on global warming as he expressed it nearly 20 years ago: “Theology, philosophy and science all speak of a harmonious universe, of a cosmos endowed with its own integrity, its own internal, dynamic nature. This order must be respected. The human race is called to explore this order, to examine it with due care and to make use of it while safeguarding its integrity.”
McElroy himself reflects that humans do not “have the right to place the balance of the global life support system at risk when there are sensible actions that can be taken to at least slow the pace of human-induced change.”  Put another way, the ethical imperative of preserving our planet outweighs the groundless opinions stubbornly maintained by a global warming skeptic.
This may seem pessimistic, but unfounded optimism is a privilege humanity cannot afford with only one planet to protect. Scientists have informed us of the imminent dangers of global warming, and we have the tools at hand to combat it. All that is needed now is a concerted, united effort to effect change. Those who deny the geological deterioration that is likely already underway are both foolish and disrespectful to future generations of our species and others. If preserving life on Earth as we know it is not reason enough to pay higher taxes, take public transportation, and err on the side of caution, I cannot imagine what else is.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late in the evening of February 9, a landmark building in the Beijing skyline, the Television Cultural Center, was consumed by fire just a few weeks ahead of its grand opening.  Ironically, fireworks celebrating the end of the Chinese New Year  were responsible for starting the blaze. In a sad spectacle rich with historical metaphors, it was as if the old Chinese spirit rebelled against the tyranny of the glass and metal skyscraper behemoths now being erected across China. 
The most curious and revealing part of the whole mess, however, was the media response to it: As the Chinese government struggled to suppress all footage of the incident (caused by their own TV personnel), blogs and tweets  carried cell-phone photos and videos around the world. Ultimately, the government’s inability to stifle the flow of information encapsulates the internal inconsistencies and long-term inviability of the Chinese political system. 
The 34-story Television Cultural Center, which was supposed to house the spiffy Beijing Mandarin Oriental, was designed by renowned Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, who intended to match the aesthetics of the adjacent China Central Television headquarters. Amidst the Olympics mania in 2004, the Chinese government hired Koolhaas’s firm to design a new headquarters for CCTV. The massive six-million-square-foot complex that resulted, which includes the Television Cultural Center, came to be known as “Zhichuang,” or “knowledge window.”  With two leaning towers connected in mid-air, the complex’s design seeks to challenge what is possible, much like the Chinese government itself.
Under direct control of the autocratic Communist Party through the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, CCTV is the largest broadcaster in the country. With 16 national channels and over 10,000 employees, it reaches over one billion people in mainland China, with around a 30-percent airtime share.  In a knowledge era, CCTV is at the core of the government’s control over the population. 
It has now become clear that CCTV employees were to blame for starting the fire that destroyed the Television Cultural Center. They ignored a government regulation forbidding the usage of fireworks and chose the unfinished building as a backdrop for their display. It soon became a chaotic spectacle, after some of the explosions ignited flammable materials within the building’s internal walls.
But, if you had been tuned in to CCTV, you would not have heard of it. As the flames consumed the symbolic building adjacent to the network’s headquarters, a notice was circulated to Chinese news websites, media outlets, and blogs telling moderators to stop reporting on the fire. The government allowed no more posts, no more news, no more photos, hoping to contain what they saw as a tragedy and perhaps a threatening omen. 
In an age of increasingly democratized media, however, the “Great Firewall of China,” as bloggers and analysts have baptized the government’s grip on the Internet, is becoming increasingly useless. In and out of China, pictures and live video feeds from cell phones were swiftly circulated, as well as Twitter updates and Google Maps photos. They even made it to the Huffington Post, where people worldwide speculated as to how the government would try to control it—the media, not the fire. 
Eventually, the government released an “official” account through the state news agency, Xinhua.  Thereafter, CCTV issued an apology regretting the damage to “state property,” although they forgot to mention the firefighter who died while combating the flames. And, finally, 12 CCTV employees were arrested “on suspicion of creating a disturbance with dangerous materials.”  Their fate is, at this point, unclear. 
Although Western hopes for change in the human-rights arena around the Olympics were thwarted last year, the CCTV complex fire shows that the current government grip on dissent and free information will become, sooner or later, unsustainable. No matter how they spin it, it was not possible for the government to control the imagery around the tragedy; everyone with access to the Internet could see the skyscraper burn. Perhaps more importantly, within China it was obvious that the elite employees of CCTV tried to get away with circumventing laws forbidding the use of fireworks in the complex. In more ways than one, it backfired—but the fact that such aristocracy exists in Chinese society is deeply resented by the rest of the population. 
China has shown the world in the last 30 years that development can be defined in many ways. But the combination of censorship, autocratic rule, and an oligarchic elite resented by lower classes does not bode well, particularly in times of economic downturn. If media censorship is the Chinese version of the French Bastille, perhaps the next fire at CCTV headquarters will be more than an unfortunate accident.

It’s Saturday, and I am writing this in Starbucks.  I had to arrive early to fight my way to a counter space between that homeless-looking guy in the bomber jacket and the two TFs who like to grade papers in total, ominous silence over their cappuccinos.  To those of you who spend your Saturdays in the airy, mostly sweet-smelling spaces of Lamont Café or the Widener Stacks, never needing to elbow anyone more threatening than a group of Weld freshmen in order to secure yourself a spot: Don’t smirk and fold your arms complacently. This could be you sooner than you think.
In a recent memo to library staff, Elizabeth Johnson, chief of staff for the librarian of Harvard College, noted that the entire Harvard College Library system is contemplating shutting its doors on Saturdays, due to budget cuts. 
This is a terrible idea on a number of levels, and it is just one more in a series of cost-cutting measures that hit students hardest.  From freezing faculty salaries, offering buyouts to Harvard’s longest-standing employees, and serving chicken nuggets twice a week, Harvard is hitting students below the belt. Harvard may be saving money, but at what cost? Granted, this university has never been famed for its fine cuisine, but its gifted faculty, dedicated staff, and world-renowned library system have played a great part in making Harvard the institution it is today. Besides, wandering through the Widener stacks is like dating an undergraduate: something that requires special permission unless you are an undergraduate.
Besides the problems this poses for thesis writers and others who need access to Harvard’s extensive collections on weekends, closing the libraries on Saturdays is exactly the opposite of how Harvard should respond to the crisis. We are going to be out in the real world dealing with the challenges of the economy in a year or two.  Instead of taking away one seventh of our access to the treasures of the Harvard library system—the largest academic library in the world—Harvard should be shoving us through those imposing Widener doors.  There is so much knowledge in the Harvard library system that there must be a solution to the financial crisis buried in there somewhere, probably between the back issues of “Playboy” and that mysterious book entitled “Privies Galore” that I’ve had to retrieve from the depository twice. Widener has everything—Henry James’s “Wings of a Dove,” the “Wings of a Dove” DVD, and several tomes on bird wings throughout history. This is the kind of knowledge that we need to be able to immerse ourselves in before we graduate, so that when future crises arise we can face them with aplomb and a withering quip from Voltaire. Also, Widener has a surprisingly excellent DVD collection, and for those of us who let our Netflix lapse—we’re in a crisis!—the loss of Saturdays puts a real damper on movie nights. 
As someone who has worked behind the Widener desk for the past two years, I can definitively state that Widener’s collection is both broad and deep.  What other library has the personal effects of Emily Dickinson and some book called “The Tao of Poop”? Harvard should be giving its students more opportunities to think great thoughts without being interrupted by calls for grande lattes, not fewer. If the people who designed our current economic system had been denied the opportunity to access Widener on Saturdays, we would probably be bartering.
Besides the academic ramifications of closing the library, there are also pressing social ramifications. Saturday is the only day people can check off the Widener box without the nagging guilt of unfinished assignments. Unlike Primal Scream, which happens but once a year, Widener was always there for us. But now we’ll have to plan our assignations around its budget cuts. And for people who rely on BoredatLamont for their romantic interactions, Saturday nights just got a lot lonelier. Everyone will have to find other places to do those things we always do in libraries, like having free wireless access and not sleeping.
The man occupying the other side of my Starbucks counter just started softly singing “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.” This would never happen at Lamont.

Members of a nutrition advisory body debated the merits of various methods of presenting calories and serving sizes for dining cuisine at a meeting of the Committee on House Life yesterday. The possibility of installing an ATM in the Quad was also on the CHL’s agenda.The nutrition group—comprising Harvard University Dining Service officials, University Health Services dieticians, undergraduates from the Community Health Initiative and Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, and House administrators—debuted a revised approach to providing nutritional information about dining hall cuisine.In an effort to accommodate students dealing with or recovering from eating disorders, HUDS removed caloric information displayed conspicuously on placards under food titles at the beginning of the academic year.But this removal did not sit well in the stomachs of some students and parents. Concerned that the lack of information could fuel unhealthy eating habits, they requested that dining hall managers reinstitute the nutritional labels.In a pressure cooker from health-conscious parents and students and individuals concerned that visual reminders could cue body image concerns and eating disorders, HUDS representatives said they’re trying to strike a balance between both sides.  On the table are two proposals, to be implemented in March. The first would provide less numerically detailed information about an item’s nutritional value on an accompanying card—for example, whether today’s chicken pot pie is a good source of fiber. The alternative plan would supply nutritional analysis of the day’s hot entrees, including calories, serving size, and fat content, in printed packets available at kiosks in each dining hall.Additionally, HUDS plans to revamp its Web site to make obtaining nutritional information more user-friendly.QUAD FAST CASHIf you’re a quadling ordering late-night takeout, it may be ATM access—not nutritional information—that gets in your way.   A Currier House resident on the Committee on House Life is spearheading an effort to bring an ATM to 64 Linnaean St., in light of the inconvenience and safety issues stemming from the lack of ATMs in close proximity to the Quad. Quad residents said this has forced them to trek to either Porter Square or Harvard Square to withdraw cash—a concern highlighted when students need money for cab fare or midnight snacks.  But a Harvard University Police Department representative at the meeting said HUPD would prioritize safety over convenience, citing the risks associated with installing an ATM in a residential area, which include increased foot traffic and public access.  While ATM providers, including Bank of America, told Quad students leading the effort that budget woes would prevent them from installing an ATM, at least one bank—Harvard University Credit Union—has said it would provide the ATM at its own expense.  Tamar Holoshitz ’10, chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Student Affairs Committee, said Quad UC representatives have received more than 200 responses about the ATM issue. She added that she didn’t anticipate river Houses requesting ATMs as well.—Staff writer Bita M. Assad can be reached at bassad@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Ahmed N.

Medpedia—an online collaborative medical encyclopedia affiliated with Harvard Medical School—debuted Tuesday after months of closed beta testing, receiving 12,000 unique visits on its first day, according to its founder. James M. Currier, the Web site’s founder and chairman, said that the encyclopedia solicits advice and articles from medical professionals, including HMS professors, in an effort to serve as an accessible, comprehensive source for health-related information, which he said involves too much paper-pushing and not enough technology at present. He said that 5,000 medical professionals signed up to edit the Web site on the day of its premiere.“The old model of medical knowledge development and creation is paper-based, hierarchal, and closed,” he said. “The new model has to be web-based, collaborative, and open.”Currier, who is a graduate of the Business School, said that Medpedia’s institutional relationship with Harvard Medical School is limited to the right to use its name and seal on the Web site. Individual faculty members are not obligated to contribute or edit articles. HMS Professor Joseph B. Martin, a former dean of the Medical School, serves on Medpedia’s Board of Advisers. Currier said that “a small percentage” of articles on Medpedia were authored by HMS professors.“We’ve taken content in from only the most prestigious and reputable sources,” Currier said. He added, however, that because medical decisions should be based on the advice of personal doctors, “ultimately, we can’t be authoritative.”To ensure that content is accurate, Medpedia requires writers and editors to verify their medical credentials before participating. Professors from the Medical School, Stanford’s School of Medicine, UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, and the University of Michigan Medical School have all contributed to the Web site.Medical professionals who have signed up to edit the site have praised Medpedia for its potential to bridge the gap between doctors and patients.Michael N. Strong, a post-doctoral fellow at HMS, said the Web site’s distinguishing feature is the option to view articles in either “plain English” or “clinical” terms.“I originally signed up out of curiosity, and I think the goals they’ve set up are excellent goals,” he said.HMS Assistant Professor of Medicine Graham T. McMahon said that Medpedia could enhance doctor-patient interaction.“I just thought it would be a way to make a contribution to patient education,” said McMahon, an endocrinologist. But only time will tell how Medpedia will impact the practice of medicine, according to Ishir Bhan ’96, an instructor in medicine at HMS.“We haven’t really had this sort of thing in medicine,” Bhan said. “If it’s active enough, you could have the benefit of experts without having to pay for it.”

Three Aces Pizza on Mass Ave., a favorite haunt of quadlings and graduate students, remains closed despite a sign that promises a January 16 return of the “original management,” after renovations are completed. The restaurant, which has been closed since January 11, is located at 1613 Mass. Ave., just beyond the North Yard construction at the Harvard Law School.The abandoned pizzeria shared the one-story retail building—owned by Harvard Real Estate—with four other businesses: the boutique “Looks,” the manicure shop Fancy Fingers, Crimson Cleaners, and Central Barber Shop. “Looks” recently moved to Harvard Square, while manicure shop Fancy Fingers and Crimson Cleaners are now closed but have not relocated. Only Central Barber Shop remains open.Mary-Ita O’Connell, who lives next door to the complex, said she has been watching the businesses in the area close one by one over the past two years.“Three Aces was a friendly place,” she said. “I got a slice of pizza there every few days, and they always had lots of students there as well.”O’Connell said she was unsure of the reason for the sudden closure of the neighborhood eatery. She also said that Harvard’s North Yard construction projects along Mass Ave. have changed the feel of the neighborhood.“I see lots of construction, but it’s all for the Law School with their big cranes,” O’Connell said. “There were five small and human businesses in that block, and the behemoth is going to devour them all.”Since 2003, the university has approved several construction projects in its Northwest campus, including plans for a large academic complex. For instance, the Everett Street Garage and the Wyeth Hall dorms were bulldozed in summer 2007 to accommodate a new academic complex on Mass. Ave. Associate Vice President for Harvard Real Estate Services James Gray stated that plans for Law School building developments in the North Yard would not affect local businesses, but he was reluctant to discuss Three Aces’ closure. “We generally don’t make comments about business relations with individual tenants,” he said.—Staff writer Shan Wang can be reached at wang38@fas.harvard.edu.

Professor Jeff W. Lichtman and his team painstakingly craft their colorful masterpieces—but their paintbrush is the genome, and their canvass the brain. Lichtman and his colleague Joshua R. Sanes, both molecular and cellular biology professors at Harvard, are mapping neurons with a pioneering method, dubbed “brainbow” for its psychedelic appearance. Already, the technique—recently honored with a Nobel Prize in chemistry—is shedding light on the development of the human mind, and how disorders such as Alzheimer’s and even anxiety alter the brain.“To get an idea of how the wiring of the brain changes, we have to figure out how things are wired,” Lichtman says. “Brainbow gives us an idea of how things are organized.” Lichtman’s group recently mapped only the second “connectome”—a group of neurons dedicated to a single function—in history. The image showed neurons for a particular mouse muscle were inexplicably longer than necessary—strongly suggesting an alternative use for the pathway.The brainbow’s bursts of color belie what its creators say is a revolutionary potential to solve the mysteries of the mind.“I think it holds the promise of changing how we look at genetics and the brain and consciousness,” Sanes says. “It’s like the human genome project.”Though the researchers have hopes for brainbow, the technique must clear some hurdles before it can illuminate the course of mental diseases and disorders.To produce the maps, researches add specialized genes to individual neurons, causing them to glow fluorescently in different colors. A connectome’s map is built by developing pictures of individual slices of nerves, and combining them to form a larger image of a passageway, like taking slices of a pipe and putting them back together. “Picture a radio in the olden days that is full of wires soldered together,” Sanes says. “Imagine slicing it into slices one millimeter thick. With each slice you can see a little shred of each part...You need to put them together to figure out the whole wiring diagram.”But the simple concept requires massive volumes of data—far beyond the capacity of current technologies. According to Sanes, mapping a human brain would demand enough storage space to host all the photos on Facebook millions of times over—now a wildly unrealistic demand.“Everything” will have to advance before such data can be processed, Sanes says. More powerful computers will need to be used, as well as perhaps some way of mathematically modeling the data.“You’d like us to tell you what this means for consciousness or for uncovering how diseases act in the brain, but we are far from that,” Sanes says. In the meantime, Sanes has a more modest goal: mapping only the neural passageways from the eyes to the brain, carefully matching up the colors on each slice to create a complete picture of the neurons, and ultimately, their functions.The researchers say they hope discovering how and why neurons change will help answer why human brains are truly different from those of other species—a question that scientists have yet been unable to elucidate.Lichtman says the explanation may lie in humans’ longer period of mental development—a process tied to how connectomes change. If brainbow can illuminate such developments, scientists could begin to better understand the brain.“I was interested in behavior in some way that was hard to put your finger on,” Sanes says. “What spot in the brain accounts for how we act? When somebody has a nervous breakdown, what is actually breaking down? We’re beginning to claw our way there.”But as Sanes and Lichtman seek to add to human understanding, they say they’re also hoping to attract undergrads to their field. Both teach MCB 80: “Neurobiology of Behavior,” where they say the sheer amount of new material in recent years illustrates the growing importance of neurobiology.“Sometimes there is this feeling that science has gone only so far, and all there is left to do is to pick up the scraps,” Lichtman says. “That couldn’t be farther from the truth with the brain. There is just this incredible reservoir of questions.”—Staff writer Paul C. Mathis can be reached at pcmathis@fas.harvard.edu.

The House of Blues, a former Harvard Square institution, broke in its new digs in Boston last night to the tune of a reunited J. Geils Band.Dan Aykroyd and Isaac Tigrett—who also founded the Hard Rock Café chain together—opened up the first House of Blues in Harvard Square on 96 Winthrop St. in 1992. It closed in 2003 after outgrowing its original space, which held only 180 people. After the House of Blues closed, Brother Jimmy’s, a southern-themed bar and restaurant, moved in for about two years. Tommy Doyle’s, an Irish-themed pub and restaurant, currently occupies the space. The House of Blues has since expanded into a national chain with about a dozen other locations. The concert promoter Live Nation bought the company in 2006.The music club chain’s new space at 15 Lansdowne St. was once occupied by popular nightclubs, including Avalon and Axis. Boston nightlife mogul Patrick T. Lyons originally planned to replace the nightclubs with a complex called Music Hall before making a deal with the House of Blues.In addition to a performance space, the Boston House of Blues will boast a restaurant, gift shop, and VIP lounge.Howie Y. Turkenkopf, the brand marketing manager for the location, said that choosing the new space—which seats nearly 2,500 people and sports eight bars in total—was a careful process. “You’re just not going to find any old property,” he said. “You need a good...space to put this venue together...so, you take your time, you find the right place.”The location was chosen for its size, its proximity to Fenway Park, and its colorful history, which includes performances by The Grateful Dead and Led Zeppelin, Turkenkopf said. He said that the inaugural show sold out in about 40 minutes. “It’s a perfect fit in terms of inaugurating a new venue,” he said of the J. Geils Band, a “legendary blues-based rock act” that performed in the same space in spring 1968, when the location was called the Boston Tea Party.Though the new House of Blues complex marks a significant departure from its cozy origins, it hasn’t lost its sense of history. About 30-40 pieces of artwork that were in the original 96 Winthrop St. location are displayed at the new locale, including 12 busts of “Blues gods,” Turkenkopf said.Some of the original staff from the Harvard Square location have also stayed with the company, including two bartenders, a security officer, and the director of sales.As the staff geared up for a busy first night, guests were already having drinks at the attached restaurant’s bar.“It’s down to the last minute,” said Turkenkopf, who received three phone calls over the course of the interview.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard will lose yet another prominent academic when proteonomics specialist and Medical School Lecturer Joshua LaBaer leaves for Arizona State University this June. Earlier this year, LaBear received an offer from Arizona State University to head the newly-founded Virginia G. Piper Center for Personalized Diagnostics, where he was promised a sizeable research fund of $10 million and an 8,000 square-foot lab space to work with. LaBaer, the founder and current director of the Institute of Proteomics at Harvard Medical School, is one of a handful of innovators in the relatively new field of proteomics, the study of protein structure and function.He said that he wanted to accept the offer in order to focus more on his career goal: developing personalized medicine technologies that would allow doctors to treat patients by tailoring medicines to their individual genomes. LaBaer’s research in proteomics is a crucial towards realizing this treatment paradigm. At ASU, he will work with the Scottsdale-based Piper Charitable Trust and the Phoenix-based Flinn Foundation, which are at the forefront of this venture. These foundations have already donated millions of dollars to the project.LaBaer said that he was pleased to participate in such a riveting new project at Arizona State University.“The Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University is an exciting program in which scientists and technology development people all over the country are going to gather to build something from ground up,” he said.  When asked about his decision to leave Harvard for an institution that is not traditionally regarded as a strong contender in biomedical research, LaBaer said that he would rise to the occasion. “It’s precisely this that makes ASU a challenge but an remarkable opportunity,” he said. The University administration said it has no current plans to replace LaBaer. The lecturer’s research will be halted in the meantime, and about half a dozen of his current staff will also transfer with him to ASU.

Members of The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, treated a room full of attentive audience members to selections from the newly reissued “Alice’s Adventures in Cambridge” at Harvard Book Store last night.The book was originally written in 1913 by R.C. Evarts, a Lampoon alumnus, as a parody of Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland.” The Lampoon contributed the foreword to the new edition, which Lampoon President Matthew K. Grzecki ’10 read aloud to the nearly-filled room.“This is an unbelievably impressive showing,” said Grzecki before delving into selections from the book.This reissue is based on an original version owned by Gus Sousa, a rare book collector and resident of Salem, Mass.  The ’Poonsters admitted in the foreward that the nearly century-old work might not appeal to readers with more modern tastes, saying that if the work was not their “‘best’ parody,” it was certainly their “most inaccessible.”“Not that this should stop the well-intentioned, naive reader from making an attempt or giving up actual money for the chance to [read it],” Grzecki read aloud.The audience laughed along as Grzecki read the book’s surreal second chapter, which featured the Keezer Cat—who offers to buy Alice’s skin— and a mustachioed Humpty Dumpty.John B. Owen ’10, another Lampoon officer, then took over and read what he claimed was a historical document he found at Widener Library. The work was called “A Guide for the Freshman of this College” and featured rules for proper freshman behavior. It also appeared in a recent issue of the Lampoon.The Harvard Book Store was pleased to host the event, said Heather Gain, marketing manager of the shop.“We’re such close neighbors here, just on opposite ends of Plympton Street,” she said of the Lampoon. “It’s great to be able to work with them on a public event.”

Harvard-affiliate Massachusetts General Hospital, considered one of the nation’s premier medical centers, has a death rate more than double the state’s average for the most common procedure used to treat heart attacks, a Harvard study reported earlier this month.The study—commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health—found the angioplasty death rate for patients admitted with heart attacks or in a state of shock was 12.6 percent at Mass. General in 2007, far above the state average of 5.5 percent.Angioplasty, a process by which a doctor clears blocked arteries using small inflated balloons, is performed on more than 1 million people in the United States each year, according to the American Heart Association.Dr. Michael A. Fifer ’74, head of Mass. General’s angioplasty program, said the hospital has known about the data for a year and that the high death rate may result from caring for many critically ill patients.“We very carefully analyzed the deaths. The findings of the reviews showed there were no quality of care issues,” Fifer said. “Every one of the reviews showed that we are faced with critically ill patients.”Fifer said he’s concerned similar studies may cause physicians to stop taking the hardest cases, which he added is occurring in his department, where doctors are “not taking on as many high risk cases” to lower mortality statistics.Medical School Professor Sharon-Lise Normand, who led the study, agreed there was a chance doctors would shift away from treating critically ill patients, but said her study controlled for risk factors that would be affected if some hospitals had a sicker body of patients than others.The death rate may reflect post-op care, Normand said, which reflects both the work of individual doctors and the entire hospital staff.“There is this tendency by the physicians and the hospitals to say they did the procedure properly,” she said. “We want people to understand mortality also measures what happens after the procedure.” Cardiologists examined the study, and hospital and physician outliers—like Mass. General—were then examined by oversight committees of cardiologists, Normand said.Normand said the state sponsored her research to provide patients with information about local hospitals, so they could make informed decisions about their treatments.“From a public perspective, it’s important to quantify standard of care,” she said.

The Cognitive Evolution Lab in William James Hall will be switching from bananas to bones as Pyschology Professor Marc D. Hauser has decided to stop his research with cotton top tamarin monkeys to work with dogs instead.Hauser said that the rising costs of care for the 40 tamarins that reside in the lab were getting too high—especially in the current economic climate—considering that his research is purely behavioral.“The granting that funds behavioral work have nowhere near the kinds of budget as the funds for biomedical research,” Hauser said.While the monkeys have been a source of controversy for animal activists, they provide a relatively rare research opportunity for Hauser’s lab, the only behavioral research lab at Harvard that uses monkeys.He said that with only 40 monkeys in residence, the sample size for his experiments is quite small.“Lots of the questions that I and my students have become interested in are questions that demand a different kind of species and testing environment,” said Hauser.He said they’d gotten to a point when they needed a bigger sample size, which could be provided by dogs that, unlike monkeys, would be brought by volunteers.“I’ve got 40 tamarins, and I can have 100 dogs,” he said.Dogs offer other advantages besides availability—they are “incredibly attentive to humans” and will therefore listen to and obey researchers, Hauser said.One of the driving questions of the lab is what makes human unique—what Hauser has termed “humaniqueness”.If something initially considered to be unique to humans is found in any other species, whether that species is dog or monkeys, then that hypothesis is defeated, Hauser said.Katherine J. McAuliffe, a graduate student in Hauser’s lab, is currently completing work on a project designed to study inequity aversion in the tamarins, which she says will be done in the few weeks before the tamarins leave.“We’re looking for a sense of fairness,” said McAuliffe. “Do primates care if they are in a set up where another individual gets way more food than they get?”Hasuer said that her work could potentially provide the first example of spiteful behavior in a non-human animal.While he said he is excited about the challenges that lie ahead and the new questions he will be able to answer using dogs, he said that he has been working with the monkeys for 16 years and has gotten to know them well.“It’s a sad moment to think this is the end of a long run,” Hauser said.Hauser is currently working on finding sanctuaries where the tamarins can spend the remainder of their lives.“Some will probably be an upgrade [from William James],” Hauser said, “in Florida or something like that.”­—Staff writer Alissa M.

Popular among bikers, rappers, and rebellious teenagers, the tattoo may become the identifying mark of a perhaps unlikely group—diabetics.Scientists at the Cambridge-based Draper laboratories are developing nanoparticle tattoo ink that changes color to indicate glucose levels in the skin. The researchers are aiming to test the ink on mice by the end of the month, said Heather Clark, a member of Draper’s biomedical engineering group. The small tattoos could replace the often painful finger-pricks that diabetics endure up to twelve times a day to monitor their blood glucose levels. The ink is composed of a glucose-detecting molecule, a color changing dye, and a molecule that mimics glucose, all of which float in spherical polymer bead. When a glucose-detecting molecule approaches the edge of the bead, it should latch onto either a glucose molecule or the glucose-like molecule.  If glucose levels are high, the detecting molecule should attach to glucose in the bead, making the ink appear yellow. If glucose levels are low, the molecule should latch onto the glucose mimic, causing the ink to turn purple. A healthy level of glucose would be represented by a color somewhere in between, explained Clark. Clark and her colleagues’ original goal was not to produce a glucose-measuring ink, but rather one to measure sodium levels in the skin, she said. When that project showed promising results in mouse trials, the director of the bioengineering department at the time challenged the researchers to apply a similar approach to glucose. Though they were initially skeptical of the project’s feasibility, Clark and her team now hope to begin animal testing in a few weeks.According to Clark, one concern that has been voiced about the technology is whether glucose measurements taken from the skin are as accurate as those taken from the blood. Others have asked whether this technology—which is still years away from being tested in humans—could be read through different skin pigments.But Gordon C. Weir, a professor of medicine at the Medical School’s Joslin Diabetes Center, remained cautiously optimistic. “Everyone is always coming up with new ideas but if this technology does what it says it does, I believe it would be a great tool for diabetes patients,” he said.

As the exodus of Harvard faculty to the Obama administration garners national attention, some students at the Harvard Kennedy School are lamenting the negative effects the appointments have had on their academic experience.The departure of four prominent Kennedy School professors—John P. Holdren, Jeffrey B. Liebman, Lawrence H. Summers, and Samantha Power—resulted in the cancellation of three spring term classes. The trimming of the course list has disappointed many students, according to student government President Benjamin M. Polk, who said that some students are now being forced to take their third and fourth-choice classes.Polk said Kennedy School administrators did not officially notify students of professors’ departures, leaving students to find out through the news media.“Some of the frustration students feel is that there’s zero communication from the administration,” he said.According to Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, who lectures on public policy at the Kennedy School, students have expressed frustration over the fact that some of the courses were cancelled on the first day of shopping period.“The administration waited a long time to announce that people were leaving,” he said, adding that he knew about many professors’ departures before students did.Due to the cancellation of Summers’ class, “The Contents of Globalization: Issues, Actors, and Decisions,” only one International Trade and Finance class is being offered this term, posing a challenge for some ITF concentrators.The Kennedy School administration has presented a more sanguine view on the situation, stressing the benefits professors will reap from experience in Washington.“For us it’s exciting that we have the caliber of faculty that a new administration would turn to and call on,” said Melodie L. Jackson, associate dean for communications and public affairs. “In the grand scheme of things, having faculty moving in and out of government is a good thing for us.”Jackson said the Kennedy School is trying to fill the void by reassigning the workload among remaining faculty or bringing in high-level visiting professors. Kennedy School Professor of Government Graham T. Allison ’62 noted that the school is also attracting people leaving the Bush administration, including Meghan L. O’Sullivan, a former deputy national security adviser, and R. Nicholas Burns, former undersecretary of state for political affairs.Polk suggested the Kennedy School’s administration accelerate the searches that are currently underway for high-level faculty positions.“The student body would have liked it if the administration had worked to bring in some rock star professors to replace the rock star professors that have left,” he said.—Staff writer Niha S.

Emmy Award winner and original “Saturday Night Live” cast member Dan Aykroyd will be honored as the Artist of the Year next Saturday at the 2009 Cultural Rhythms Show. The event, organized by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, will kick off in the afternoon with a roast of Aykroyd, followed by a luncheon held in Kirkland dining hall. The day’s events in Sanders Theatre will feature an award presentation and performances by a number of Harvard dance and singing groups, including Harvard Bhangra, the Harvard-Radcliffe Kuumba Singers, and the Expressions Dance Troupe.This year marks the 23rd time the Foundation has given the Artist of the Year Award, which recognizes humanitarian efforts and achievements in the arts.Aykroyd is well-known for his performances in comedies such as “Ghostbusters” and “The Blues Brothers,” and has been an Oscar and Grammy Nominee.According to Cultural Rhythms Co-Director Nworah B. Ayogu ’10, Aykroyd was selected for the award for both his popular and charitable work.  “The Artist of the Year is not only chosen for their contributions to the arts, but for their contributions to society,” he said. “Dan Aykroyd is someone unique because of his commitment to humanitarian organizations like Artists Against Racism.”Co-Director Jacqueline C. Hairston ’10 said Aykroyd’s influence in the music industry was also an important factor in deciding the award.“We selected him because he has done a lot in terms of race relations and bringing black music to the forefront,” she said. “We thought he would be a great addition to our program.”Ayogu said the event “is a chance to celebrate the cultural diversity of Harvard and share it with the rest of the campus.”Past Cultural Rhythms Artists of the Year include Will Smith, Matt Damon, Denzel Washington, Halle Berry, and Jackie Chan. Proceeds from the show will go the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.Tickets for Cultural Rhythms are available at the Harvard Box Office in the Holyoke Center. Cultural Rhythms representatives expressed their excitement for Aykroyd’s visit.“He’s a comedian and writer, so we’re excited to see what his creative mind will come up with next Saturday,” said Ayogu.—Staff writer Wyatt P.

His first two points of the night are huge, as the team goes up, 54-51.37.1: Controversy. McNally steals the ball, but doesn't look to have control, and ball goes out off him. The referees rule that it was a steal, giving Princeton a BIG break to run more time off because this ruling resets the shot clock.

Then the team leads, 50-49.2:50 Housman board on Princeton miss. Good D from the Crimson. Yale just upset Cornell. If Princeton wins, the team is a game back in the loss column, along with Columbia, for Ivy League first place.3:30 Housman takes it to Davis, big bucket, 49-48 Harvard. Every time at Princeton, Drew just gets to the bucket at abandon. He has 14 to lead the Crimson. Lin with 13.

Not good news for a Harvard squad struggling mightily, to put it mildly.10:12 Davis with jumper over Lin. 41-34 Princeton.Somehow, the Crimson is only down five. Looking at the stats, I don't know how its possible. They're being out shot 50 to 39.5 percent, Princeton has made six threes to Harvard's sole trifecta. What's keeping them in the game: 11-16 from the free throw line. Princeton has one free throw makeLin comes back in, finally, but Kenyi gets offensive foul. Things are unraveling for the Crimson.

Pretty play to tie it at 34-34.14:18 Lin is hurt. On the last possession, Lin traveled, and it looks like he is cramping, or an ankle injury. Does not look serious.Both teams cold on the offense end, as Housman barely misses tough layup.15:16 Lin misses two.Housman comes over the top to steal from the bigs. Lin gets fouled but no call. Princeton misses three. Harvard can't corral the rebound. Tigers miss a runner, and Harris somehow snags the board. Lin takes it to the basket and gets fouled hard, and he will take two shots.

Housman is playing well, but Lin needs to get going for Harvard to get back in it.7:22 Harvard has picked up the offense--a tad--and now it's 16-11 Tigers with just over seven minutes to play.11:00 Lin hits beautiful fade away three, 10-7 TigersSlow start for the Harvard Crimson here, as the team is only 1-9, I repeat, 1-of-9 to start, trailing Princeton 8-4 with 11:36 to play.
