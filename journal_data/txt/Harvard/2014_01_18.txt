After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Golf is a uniquely competitive sport. Whilst you are attempting to outperform your opponents, their performance has no impact on your game. You play in a vacuum. To win you must overcome your own mental demons.
“We try to look at [golf] as you’re not actually trying to hit a serve past someone or block a shot or tackle someone, you’re really much more trying to play your game to the best of your ability,” said Kevin Rhoads, head coach of both the men’s and women’s golf teams at Harvard. “[Our philosophy] is about trying to focus our efforts onto things we can actually control.”
Rhoads, who was recently named the 2013 PGA New England Teacher of the Year, has coached the women’s team to Ivy League championships in four of the past six seasons. He has led the girls to their best start to a season in recent memory this year, winning three tournaments outright already in 2013-14.
Rhoads’ success as a coach is guided by a distinct philosophy that aims to alleviate the mental rigor of competitive golf. In seeking the best outcomes for his players, Coach Rhoads consistently stresses the process over the outcome.
“It makes logical sense to me that we are always trying to judge ourselves on controllable factors and though I care very, very deeply about the outcome in golf, namely the outcome of ‘the score’, unfortunately it is a couple of steps removed from what we can actually control,” Rhoads said. “So when people get really focused on trying to beat an opponent or shoot a certain score on a given day, sometimes they do it and feel really good about themselves but oftentimes they don’t … which leads to diminished performance.”
Rhoads’ introduces his argument with the following thought process: For a round, can I control the score I am going to shoot today? No, he answers, otherwise I would just shoot my best score every time. On a given hole, can I control the number of strokes I am going to shoot? No again, otherwise I would make a birdie every time. He continues: on a given shot, can I control exactly where I want to hit it? No, not even tour players have that ability, he says, if they did then they would play perfectly every day.
By embracing the above logic, Rhoads’ players are encouraged to consider what things are truly under their control, subsequently optimizing those through a well-defined process. The process is different for each player and Rhoads coins the term ‘sensory focus’ as to what goes into each individual’s process.
“We like the idea of sensory focus, which can mean many different things,” Rhoads says. “It can mean I see the outcome of the shot, I visualize it and I try to make my body do it. Or it can mean I focus on a certain tempo and when I swing like that my ball tends to go in a certain direction. For some people it’s more of a technical feel and can be feeling the club coming from a certain direction or feeling what their wrists are doing at a certain time in a swing.”
Through practice, players are able to nail down what they need to focus on in order to produce the process most suited to their game.
Crucial to this philosophy is rewiring one’s brain to evaluate shots not by their specific outcome, but rather by how the process was followed. In this way, Rhoads can ensure his players’ temperament never becomes too negative. This allows them to unleash, as he puts it, their inner athlete.
“Defining that as success instead of the other stuff frees us up to say ‘Hey, I’m doing the things I am supposed to be doing’”, Rhoads says. “Having the freedom to really only judge on those things, in my opinion, frees up each player’s athlete or machine to perform at its highest level. Whereas if we are focused on ‘I want to shoot a certain score’, or ‘I don’t want to hit it in the water’ or ‘I do want to beat that person’, then most people’s bodies don’t know what to do with that and they get a bit defensive, and they don’t perform the same way.”
Senior captain Bonnie Hu, who has played under Rhoads for four years, explains that while this philosophy has always been part of Rhoads’ creed, it has been stressed more this season than in years past. During the spring last year, Rhoads met several influential coaches in Arizona who emphasize a more mental approach to the sport, spurring him to formalize his philosophy in practice.
Hu said that her continued experience under Rhoads has allowed her to gain more from his philosophy, as she has the self confidence to overcome short-term bad outcomes.
“Once experienced you’re able to get a better perspective on things and not get too attached to an individual shot outcome,” Hu says. “As you get older you are able to have more confidence in yourself as a player. You are able to better internalize the notion ‘I just hit a bad shot, but that doesn’t mean I’m a bad player’.”
Hu’s specific process is grounded in being fully committed to the shot and that coupled with her experience has allowed her to blossom under Rhoads’ tutelage.
“When I do hit a bad shot, Kevin encourages us to think back whether we did the things we needed to focus on to hit a good shot,” Hu said. “For me personally, one thing I especially have to focus on is staying committed to the shot. Generally, when I am not committed to a shot, the shot goes badly.”
“Everyone on the team understands where he is coming from,” Hu continued. “They really understand the system as it pertains to themselves.”
However, the coach is keen to stress that process alone is not why his players compete. He cares deeply about outcomes and likes his players to be fiercely competitive. Reconciling this desire to win with de-emphasizing outcomes is the final piece to Rhoads’ puzzle, which he describes as a ‘calibration component’.
“I don’t want us to be completely passive in using ‘process’ as the goal of the outcome,” Rhoads says. “There is a calibration component where we take every shot, we say ‘did I do my process correctly?’ and if the answer is yes, then we can start to say ‘and if I’m doing my process correctly, did the ball go in the right place?’. If the answer is no, then we do have to say ‘well, what do we need to change?’ Do I either calibrate the input I am using or do I change the input I am using based on other known parameters?”
Combining this calibration with an internal acknowledgement that the traditional outcome, the quality of the shot, is real ultimately leads to a successful refinement of the individual’s process.
Rhoads’ whole system of thought is designed with the intention of lessening the mental blow of a bad shot on a player, increasing the consistency of his player’s performance and banishing mental demons. After four years at Harvard, Hu has fully embraced her coach’s philosophy.
“I think for me personally focusing on process means not worrying about whatever the outcome is because in a lot of situations the outcome is not fully controllable,” Hu says. “It’s about focusing on those things which are under your control. When I hit a shot, whatever happens happens and I’m okay with whatever the result is because I know that given the situation I tried to the best of my ability with the tools I had at that moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Returning home after a nationally-televised rout, the Harvard men’s hockey team walked into a hostile, sold-out Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday night looking for its first conference win in two months. It left with one of its most frustrating losses of the season.
 
The Crimson (5-9-3, 2-7-3 ECAC) played some of its best minutes of the year Friday, dominating the offensive zone for long stretches of the third period in front of a Big Red-heavy crowd. But the hosts could not overcome their earlier mistakes as No. 12 Cornell (9-4-3, 5-3-2 ECAC) skated to a 3-2 win.
 
“You can’t just walk away from this one,” freshman Sean Malone said. “Those are points that we need right now. I thought that there were a lot of things that we did well but you have to do this consistently, every game. I thought maybe for 10 minutes there we didn’t and it cost us the game.”
 
A short-hander and two last-minute strikes off Harvard turnovers gave the visitors all the goals they needed. After goals from Malone and freshman forward Devin Tringale erased a two-goal deficit, senior center Dustin Mowrey provided the game winner with 20 seconds left in the middle frame.
 
Cornell’s first two goals came in the first period off a shorthanded breakaway from junior Madison Dias on Harvard’s first power play and, 13 minutes later, a strike from sophomore forward Christian Hilbrich with four seconds left on the clock.
 
Senior goaltender Andy Iles did the rest for the Big Red in the third, making 11 saves in the final frame and killing off two Crimson power plays in the final 10 minutes of regulation.
 
Harvard entered Friday looking for its first conference win since a 5-3 win at Princeton on Nov. 15. Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 opted to start goaltender Steve Michalek after the junior came off the bench to replace senior starter Raphael Girard in the Crimson’s 5-1 loss to Yale in the Rivalry On Ice game at Madison Square Garden on Saturday. Michalek was a solid presence between the pipes for Harvard on Friday, stopping 25 of 28 shots and yielding no easy goals, but the Crimson left points on the table.
 
“I think we are frustrated. We beat ourselves,” Donato said. “Both times [Cornell scored in the last minute of the period] we had full possession of the puck and basically turned it over and first goal we get beat on a bad change and gave up a breakaway. We didn’t make them work for their opportunities.”
 
In its first game of 2014, Cornell showed little rust in the opening minutes, holding Harvard to zero shots on goal through the first nine and a half minutes and keeping any Crimson opportunities to the outside. On offense, junior defender Joakim Ryan set up Cornell’s first two goals with blueline-to-blueline passes. With Hilbrich in the box early in the first period, Ryan intercepted an attempted dump-in from Harvard junior defender Patrick McNally and advanced the puck to Dias, who broke away to beat Michalek over his right shoulder 6:22 into the opening frame.
 
Ryan struck again in the final seconds of the period, stripping sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey of the puck in the neutral zone and then lofting a pass to Hilbrich. Hilbrich skated around Harvard junior defenseman Max Everson in the slot before beating Michalek right-side to put the visitors up, 2-0.
 
Malone helped Harvard respond with goals five minutes apart in the second period. The freshman center muscled a shot past Iles while drawing a hooking penalty at 10:17 and then, five minutes later, won a battle on the Cornell back boards to find Tringale isolated against the Big Red goaltender for a shorthanded strike.
 
The puck seemed to be sliding in Harvard’s favor, but Cornell capitalized on one more costly Crimson turnover as time expired in the second. Hilbrich stripped the puck from McNally behind the Harvard goalline and advanced it on to junior forward Brian Ferlin, who cycled the puck to Dustin Mowrey in the right face-off circle for a one-timer with 19.7 seconds left in the frame. The goal proved decisive.
Harvard had multiple chances to tie in the third but were unable to convert. Vesey rang a shot off the pipe 33 seconds into the period, and Iles came up with a stop two minutes later on a point-blank shot from sophomore forward Brayden Jaw under the right faceoff circle.
The Crimson commanded the Cornell zone for the final ten minutes of regulation, and freshman Harvard center Alex Kerfoot and Jaw drew minor penalties at 11:32 and 15:40, respectively. Despite looks from Vesey, Esposito, and Criscuolo, Iles carried the visitors through the man advantages and the final minutes of regulation.
 
Midway through its conference season, Harvard finds itself in a familiar position, tied for the fewest number of wins in the ECAC. While the Crimson showed glimpses of its potential on Friday, the team and its coach are not prepared to accept moral victories.
 
“The team has high expectations top to bottom. I think that we are not going to settle for, ‘Hey we have a lot of young guys and it was a close game’,” Donato said. “We expect better for ourselves, and I think we will get there very quickly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team needed to score a season high five goals to get past Colgate in a come-from-behind-win, 5-4, Friday night as the Crimson (13-2-2, 8-2-1 ECAC) was able to battle back from a lost lead and beat the Raiders (5-15-2, 2-8-0) at Starr Rink in Hamilton, NY.
In a game that saw three lead changes, Harvard was able to persevere and overcome a 2-4 deficit early in the third period after it took a 2-1 lead at the beginning of the game.
“Overall I think we would have wanted to come out with a faster start, but we got better as the game went on and answered back when we needed to and protected the lead at the end, which was key for us,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said.
Colgate broke through during the first minute of the game on a goal by junior forward Taylor Craig. The junior was assisted by classmate Katie Case, who passed Craig the puck in front of the Crimson’s goal.
The Raiders had more shots on goal than Harvard with 29 to the Crimson’s 25. Harvard goalie Emerance Maschmeyer had 25 saves on the night for the Crimson, while Colgate’s Ashlynne Rando had 20 saves.
“Obviously we had to battle back from a lot of adversity going down a couple times and I think we showed a lot of character and drive by being able to come back from a two goal deficit,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said.
Harvard was able to answer Colgate’s early goal with back-to-back scores in the second period from Crowe and sophomore forward Mary Parker. Parker’s goal came on an assist from sister Elizabeth a minute into the second period. Mary took Elizabeth’s pass and made a shot to the left and found an empty pocket in the back of the Raiders’ goal to tie the game at one.
“It definitely felt really good to get that first goal for the team, especially after the team went down 1-0,” Parker said. “There was a lot of good passing involved and we all put effort into that first goal.”
The Crimson’s go-ahead goal in the second period came less than a minute after Parker’s, when Crowe drove down the ice, unassisted, and drove the shot into the Colgate goal.
“Going into the second period coming off being down in the first period we just came out in the beginning [of the second period] and pop a few quick goals in to boost our confidence,” Parker said.
Harvard’s lead came to an end as the second period dwindled. The Raiders went ahead 3-2 on a goal at 10:35 from Colgate senior forward Jocelyn Simpson, who was assisted by senior forward Rachel Walsh.
However, going into the final period of play, Harvard was determined to finish the game right.
“We knew that if we stuck to our game, worked hard, and put pucks on the net that good things were going to happen and we didn’t need to freak out,” Crowe said. “We focused on playing fast, but not hurrying because we had faith in ourselves if we focused on playing our game for a solid 20 minutes.”
The Raiders tacked on another goal at the beginning of the third period to put the Crimson in a two-goal hole, 4-2, with 17 minutes left in the game. The final 10 minutes of the contest proved to be the most valuable for Harvard, with three goals, including the game winner, coming in the final stages of the game.
“We hadn’t been testing the goalie as much as we could have been in the beginning of the game,” D’Oench said. “That’s how we’ve been successful earlier in the season so we just wanted to do more of it.”
With six minutes and eight seconds left in the game, Crowe was fed a pass from teammate Briana Mastel, took a wide angle shot that saw the puck find the back of the net above the goalie’s glove.
“It was an awesome feeling,” Crowe said. “Everyone was ecstatic in the huddle and it gave us the momentum we needed to maintain the lead and play solid defense for the remainder of the game.”
From that point on, Harvard was able to play tough defense and hold its lead.
“From that point on it was just about working hard and playing smart and working hard to make sure we win battles,” Miye D’Oench said. “It was just about trusting each other and making sure everyone was doing their job and not trying to cover for anyone else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Coming off the 2014 Rivalry on Ice game against Yale, the Harvard men’s hockey team battled another ancient rival in No. 12 Cornell.
 
The final score may have been closer, but the same frustration remained.
 
Giving up two goals in the final seconds of both the first and second period, as well as a shorthanded score in the first as well, the Crimson (5-9-3, 2-7-3 ECAC) could not come back against the visiting Big Red (9-4-3, 5-3-2), falling 3-2 Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
 
With a fairly young team this season – 29 of the last 32 goals have been scored by underclassmen - Harvard has had difficulty putting together a complete 60-minute performance thus far. Again this was the case Friday night, with a few mistakes resulting in a Crimson loss.
 
“You know you can’t just walk away from this one,” freshman forward Sean Malone said. “Those are points that we need right now. I thought we did a lot of things well but you have to do it consistently every game and I thought for maybe 10 minutes there we didn’t and it cost us the game.”
 
Both the first and third goals for Cornell were the result of ill-timed changes, leaving Harvard vulnerable without any support to defend the rushing Big Red skaters. Madison Dias broke free and netted his first goal of the season to open the scoring, while Dustin Mowrey finished strong puck movement by Cornell and beat Crimson junior goalie Steve Michalek high glove side.
 
Harvard pressured the Big Red throughout the third, especially in the final half of the period, but was unable to find the equalizer, with senior goalie Andy Iles making half of his 22 saves in the final frame.
 
LAST MINUTE LAPSES
 
The 142nd matchup between the Crimson and Cornell featured hard-fought hockey throughout, but it was two late period lulls - one in the first and one in the second - that ended up costing Harvard in the end.
 
“We are frustrated. We beat ourselves,” Crimson coach Ted Donato '91 said. “We gave up two goals in the last 20 seconds, one at the end of the first, one at the end of the second. Both times we had full possession of the puck and basically turned it over… we left the door open with the two goals at the end of the periods.”
 
In the closing seconds of the initial period, Christian Hilbrich was able to take a pass from Joakim Ryan, deke the Harvard defender, and then beat Michalek with a backhanded shot with just four seconds remaining to make it 2-0.
 
The Crimson was able to tie it up in the second period, gaining momentum with two straight goals in response. But with just under 20 seconds remaining in the second period, after Cornell won the battle behind the net, Mowrey finished off two consecutive passes from Brian Ferlin and Hilbrich to put the Big Red up for good. 
 
SHORTHANDED, NO PROBLEM
 
Coming into Friday night’s contest, it was expected that special teams would be a factor, with Cornell having the second best power-play unit in the nation and the Crimson possessing the 11th best penalty kill.
 
But it was the Big Red’s penalty kill that struck first, with Dias scoring the first shorthanded goal for the team all season. The junior forward found himself all alone in front of Michalek after a long pass up ice from defenseman Joakim Ryan, who is now tied with Brian Ferlin for team lead in points with 18.
 
That would be all the offense Cornell would get from its special teams, with the Crimson shutting out the Big Red power play, 0-3 on the night. Harvard did not only kill all of Cornell’s man-advantage opportunities, it was able to knot the score at two with its own shorthanded goal.
 
After Malone won the battle along the boards behind the Big Red net, he sent it in front of the goal to freshman Devin Tringale, who was then able to beat Iles for his first collegiate goal.
 
“I tried to pressure them and skate as hard as I could and fortunately got the bounce and got it up to [Tringale] for the goal,” Malone said.
 
Malone was a bright spot for the Crimson in a night where four of the points came from freshmen, which Harvard has relied heavily this season. The young team hopes to correct the costly mistakes, using its experience against 10 ranked teams thus far in the coming weeks in the final month of the season.
 
“We expect better from ourselves and I think we’ll get there shortly,” Donato said.
