After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not The Game, but The Race.
And after the Harvard men's heavyweight crew's first varsity eight cruised to a 9.9-second victory over Yale in the 147th Harvard-Yale Regatta, the Crimson has now captured both historic events in the 2011-12 season.
The rest of the Harvard boats fared just as well in the regatta, sweeping the Bulldogs.
“All of the seniors thought it was really important to us to leave a little legacy as we are graduating,” said senior Nick Jordan, five seat of the second varsity eight. “I was really proud of all of the boats doing well in occasionally tough conditions.”
With Saturday’s results on the Thames River in New London, Conn., Harvard recorded its fifth straight sweep of Yale and its 12th varsity win over the Bulldogs in its last 13 tries.
The Crimson seniors capped off their H-Y careers by never having experienced a loss to their historic rivals during their four years on the team.
“It’s pretty special that no boats have lost to Yale in my memory,” captain Michael DiSanto said. “I have never been down here and known a loss to Yale. We have now tied the longest record for consecutive sweeps at five, and it was cool having been a part of four of them.”
Jordan reflected on the uniqueness of the historic Harvard-Yale Regatta experience.
“You are engulfed in the team all the time and away from all other distractions,” Jordan said. “You really appreciate the guys in your crew and the tradition of Harvard rowing as a whole.”
The Harvard first varsity eight capped off its undefeated dual season with a clear victory over the Bulldog crew on the four-mile course. The Crimson finished in 19:41.3.
The Harvard rowers’ previous H-Y experience helped contribute to their success on the longer-distance course.
“[Harvard coach] Harry [Parker] builds in training for this race throughout the year, since our first week in school,” DiSanto said. “It is not the first time we are seeing the four-mile distance.... And, as a senior, you have done it a few times before.  We had four seniors in the boat, so we had some knowledge of how to race the four-mile distance, which was helpful.”
The second varsity race was the most uneven matchup of the day. The Crimson took the lead early in the race and continued to stretch it throughout the three-mile course. Harvard won in 14:55.5 with a 31.7-second margin over Yale.
“I think Yale just didn’t show up to race,” Jordan said. “We were pretty confident going in. But we thought they were going to be aggressive off the start and try to throw us off our game, so we tried to do the exact same thing.”
After taking a boat-length lead over the Bulldogs, the whole boat was energized to keep increasing the gap.
“We took 12 seconds in the first third of the race,” Jordan said. “We kept going for more. We got pretty tired for the second half of the race because we had put a lot into the first half. But by then, we had a really good margin and just cruised on over to the finish.”
The freshman eight posted an 8.5-second win over Yale after the two-mile race had to be paused and restarted by officials. Large waves from a passing speedboat disrupted the crews and threatened to affect the race. After the restart, the Crimson finished off the last half mile of the race for a combined winning time of 10:25.6.
The combination fours raced on Friday, with both Harvard crews finishing ahead of the Bulldogs. The Crimson A and B fours finished in 11:22 and 11:27, respectively, over Yale’s time of 11:48.
IRA National Championships are the last remaining event of the collegiate rowing season.  Harvard looks to boost its speed as it will face big-name crews in the faster-pace championship racing.
“We have certainly picked up some speed from where we were at [EARC] Sprints,” DiSanto said. “Harry [Parker] has worked us hard, and we have responded well. I am excited to get on the water down in New Jersey and see how fast we can get it going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, things looked bright for Radcliffe heavyweight crew, as the Black and White took home two victories in the inaugural Ivy League Championships.
But that momentum proved to not be enough against the nation’s toughest competition in this past weekend’s NCAA Championships. In a 16-team field, Radcliffe placed 12th overall while the varsity eight took ninth on Mercer Lake in West Windsor, N.J.
The varsity four also placed 11th, its best mark in nine years.
“There was just fast racing all around,” said junior Scout Moran, two seat of the 1V. “Races were won and lost by hundredths of a second, which just really shows how fast Division I rowing is right now. So to have the opportunity to race [at the NCAA Championships] was really exciting for us.”
“There was some really good competition that we hadn’t really seen before, especially the California schools and some of the Midwest and Southern schools,” added freshman Kristen Faulkner, two seat of the varsity four. “So it was great to get the chance to compete against them.”
None of the three Radcliffe boats—the varsity eight, the second varsity eight, or the varsity four—advanced to their respective Grand Finals on Sunday. Instead, the 1V and varsity four took third and fifth in their respective six-boat petite finals, while the 2V placed last of the four boats in its third-level final.
The conclusion of the NCAA Championships marks the end of a season highlighted by the Radcliffe first varsity eight’s first Ivy title in nearly a decade.
And for the Black and White 1V, along with its varsity four counterpart, the weekend event started off strong. Both took third in their heats on Friday, earning them an automatic entry into the semifinals the following day.
But that was as far as either boat went. Both finished in fourth place in their semifinals on Saturday, one spot away from earning a trip to the grand finals on Sunday.
For much of its semifinals race, the Radcliffe 1V threatened the eventual top-three finishers—Virginia, USC, and California. Halfway through, the Black and White was just one seat away from passing California, in third at the time and at the race’s conclusion. But Radcliffe could not overcome the deficit, ultimately finishing 1.90 seconds behind the Golden Bears.
“We came up short [of qualifying for the Grand Final], but we were very close,” Moran said. “We really made a great effort to push it to Cal. In our sprint, we gained a lot of seats. We still weren’t fast enough to make the top three.”
In the varsity eight petite final, UCLA held the edge over Radcliffe  and Stanford coming into the final portion of the race while Yale, Cornell, and Ohio  State trailed further back. In a tight finish, Stanford just beat out  the Black and White for second place by 0.03 seconds.
“The petite final was another barnburner,” Moran said.
In the varsity four semifinal race, Radcliffe held on to a tenuous third-place position—good enough for a grand-final berth—heading into the final 500 meters of the race. But Washington overcame the Black and White, ultimately finishing in third at 7:11.25, less than a second ahead of fourth-place Radcliffe.
“In the last 250, 200 meters, Washington just sprinted so fast and really caught us off guard and ended up out-touching us by very little…. If the race had been about 15 to 20 meters shorter, we probably would have gotten them,” Faulkner said.
A similar pattern emerged in the following day’s petite final. Though the Black and White were ahead a quarter of the way through the race, the lead proved short-lived, and Radcliffe finished in fifth place.
The Black and White second varsity eight did not enjoy the same success on the weekend and did not qualify for its semifinal. Ultimately placing last of the 16 second varsity eight boats, the Radcliffe 2V placed fifth out of six in its initial heat on Friday. With a sixth-place finish in the repechage later that day, the Black and White failed to qualify for the semifinals and was instead relegated to Sunday’s third-level final.
