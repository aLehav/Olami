After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
In its story "The Rise of HPAC" (May 30, 2013), The Crimson rightly identifies many of the roles that Harvard communications plays in the life of the University. We highlight the work of students and the research of Harvard faculty. We work collaboratively with colleagues at Harvard’s Schools. We convey information about milestones and initiatives ranging from research breakthroughs and faculty papers to Harvard’s 375th anniversary and the return of the ROTC to campus. We also serve as a coordinator for media inquiries to ensure accuracy in how the University is portrayed in the press.
Unfortunately The Crimson’s characterization of HPAC's growth and size is wrong on the numbers and incomplete on context. The Crimson asserted that the number of Harvard communicators has more than doubled since 2008. That is not even close to true. Core HPAC staffing levels have grown by only 3.7% annually since 2008. Moreover, HPAC’s core budget has grown by only 2.3% annually over the corresponding period, in line with most school budgets and most central administration departments. The direction given to HPAC, as to other central units, has been to find ways to be both more effective and more efficient as we continue to operate in a resource-constrained environment.
We seek to do this in a rapidly changing communications environment; one where the 24-7 nature of the news media is amplified moment to moment by new technologies, where social and digital tools are central to storytelling, and where the communications demands on respected, global institutions such as Harvard grow daily. As a result, Harvard Public Affairs and Communications (the renamed Office of Government, Community, and Public Affairs, which has existed for more than 40 years) has grown over the last decade, as have communications teams at most other institutions around the country.
Unfortunately, The Crimson’s story completely misses several relevant pieces of information. Eight of the positions counted as “new” by The Crimson in 2013 are identical to positions that existed within this unit in 2008. The Crimson does not count those in its 2008 number. An additional eight of the "new" positions also existed in 2008, but moved within HPAC as part of a central administration-wide effort to bring similar expertise, once strewn throughout various silos, under one roof to increase efficiencies and—importantly—to reduce a reliance on outside vendors and consultants. A similar exercise took place in other central departments.
It is true that new positions have been added to meet the demands of digital communications, although in many cases colleagues counted as part of HPAC by The Crimson actually report to Alumni Affairs & Development, not HPAC, based on an effort to combine those units to—once again—create efficiencies.
We would have happily explained all of this to The Crimson before publication of its story, but neither we nor our colleagues in Human Resources or Finance and Administration were asked by The Crimson to verify the numbers. We have provided this information in detail to The Crimson since publication, but the correction posted to The Crimson website does not address the inaccurate characterizations of the department’s size or growth.
As the University department that regularly provides information to—and organizes interviews on behalf of—the media (including The Crimson), we understand that reporters, in an effort to be fair and accurate, typically provide the opportunity to comment on specific claims such as a growth in staffing or budget numbers. The Crimson chose not to do so in this instance, and the accuracy of its story suffered as a result. We are pleased to set the record straight.
Sincerely,
Christine Heenan
Vice President, Public Affairs and Communications
Paul Andrew
Assistant Vice President, Communications
Editors’ Note: The claims in this letter are based on an earlier version of The Crimson's May 30, 2013 story "The Rise of HPAC," which has since been corrected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MUNGULE, Zambia—Out comes the “knife girl” amidst ferocious applause! Why have a flower girl when you can arm a pre-pubescent girl with a large carving knife instead?
She dances down the aisle in pink jeans and a tank top with a crew of back-up dancers in shiny purple taffeta. At the end of the aisle is a large, white-frosted wedding cake waiting to be sliced. The only aim the “knife girl” has is to make it down the aisle towards the cake and garner as much applause and money as possible. According to tradition, people are supposed to sprinkle money near the “knife girl”—proceeds for the wedding party.
I sit about three rows back from all this in a plastic lawn chair. Alongside me is the village pastor who insisted on bringing me along despite the fact that I most certainly was not invited. This is the first wedding I’ve ever crashed, and unlike Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson I do not have a set protocol for these things, or a convenient way to blend in.
The only wedding I thought I would be attending this summer was my brother’s, due to take place in a Long Island wedding hall in early August. I have watched the wedding unfold into a yearlong saga of Facebook status updates, save-the-dates, bridesmaid dresses, and wedding registries. This has given me time to anticipate the moment and all that it might hold, both good and bad.
This wedding, in contrast, I had only learned about an hour ago. I hadn’t had time to anticipate anything, buy a gift, or even get dressed. But, having left my overanxious tendencies back in America, I was having a pretty great time.
Americans dispel stress by planning. We plan for the worst-case scenario, no matter how unlikely. “Does the wedding hall have flood insurance in the one in a million chance Long Island gets a hurricane in early August?” we ask. And, of course, it does.
Zambians dispel stress by refusing to worry. The wedding that I attended that day was supposed to start at 2PM. I showed up at 4PM and finally watched the bride walk down the aisle a little after 5PM. And it went very well. All the close friends and family waited patiently, knowing it was an important day, and the bride and groom were successfully, thrillingly married.
I’m in danger of some extreme, anthropologically-incorrect overgeneralizing in those previous paragraphs. I’m sure there was a lot of planning that went on behind-the-scenes of the Zambian wedding (I mean, look at that choreography!). I also think Americans are more than capable of dealing with delayed weddings, after all, it’s been the staple plotline of American sit-com finales for decades. I think the real difference I noted was the attitude Zambians had in dealing with last-minute mishaps.
When a close friend or family friend is experiencing one of the most important moments of their lives, it doesn’t really matter if the steak is overcooked, or if the great uncle is drunk, or the wedding starts late. So much good will has been invested in the moment, that it is the obligation of those who have the honor of attending to return that investment of good will. We can all afford to live a little more in the moment.
At an American wedding no one would ever give a seven year-old a long, sharp knife and tell her to dance down the aisle. (Think of all the worst-case scenarios there.) But maybe we can learn to approach life this way— childish smiles on our faces, only the goal of enjoying the present moment, dancing towards our destination.

ENOSHIMA, Japan—How odd to find myself standing on the other side of the ocean that I had swam in all my childhood. Yet there I was, together with three other American students, making my way towards Enoshima, an almost-island stuck out into the Pacific and connected to the mainland of Japan by a defiantly narrow spit of sand, far too small to accommodate the foot traffic that Enoshima receives. The breeze off the water makes the area a popular place of refuge from the stifling summer heat. On the weekends, hundreds of people from Tokyo, ourselves included, flock to the area. We found the pedestrian bridge thronged with fellow tourists. Here, as elsewhere in Japan, the traditional brushes shoulders with the modern -- the edges of the thoroughfare were lined with people selling paintings, calligraphy, and Jet Ski rides.
Tiny Enoshima is hilly and thickly forested, and a village is built up the side of a slope, its main road snaking upward towards the shrine that crowns the island.  Dominating the skyline was a huge vermilion torii, the gate which marks the entrance to Shinto shrines and divides the sacred world from the profane. We climbed upward towards the holy site, but here too the road was packed with day-trippers. Numerous barbecue stalls made the air thick with the smell of smoke and frying squid and sent out punishing blasts of heat whenever there was a flare-up. The owners of the street’s many tiny shops leaned out of their doorways, enticing passersby to come in with competing calls of “Irasshaimase!” or “ Welcome!” Their wares often spilled out of the confines of their shops and onto the sidewalk. We jostled past racks of kimono and paper fan displays on our way up the hill.
But when we reached the top, the heat and bustle of below seemed far more distant than the few steps it took to pass under the torii gate’s arch. In stark contrast with the densely crowded streets and shops, the buildings of the temple complex were scattered throughout the woods, and as we walked through the dappled shade, free at last from the throng of people, I felt what is so elusive in a city of over ten million: peace.

Treasury secretary... Harvard President... Federal Reserve chair? Speculation that the resume of University professor Lawrence H. Summers might lengthen even further swirled this week after the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that he was interested in heading the central bank. According to the Journal, some of Summers’s current and former colleagues described Summers as ambivalent about the job, while others characterized him as "hellbent" on it.
Summers, who was Harvard president from 2001 to 2006, is no stranger to the Obama administration. He was director of the National Economic Council from 2009 to 2010, a term that, according to the Journal’s anonymous source, ended with a private conversation with President Obama about Summers becoming Fed chief.
Current Fed chairman Ben S. Bernanke will finish his second four-year term on Jan. 31, and many believe that he is unlikely to seek another, which will open the door for a replacement. Late last month, several outlets reported that the White House has a shortlist of candidates for the job, but their sources did not offer names. But Summers, Fed vice chair Janet L. Yellen, former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, and President and CEO of retirement services organization TIAA-CREF Roger W. Ferguson, Jr. are widely considered to be potential picks.
Summers’s spokesperson Kelly Friendly told Flyby on Thursday that Summers would not comment on his interest in the job or any conversations he may have had about it with Obama. And Politico reported Wednesday that Summers’s acquaintances said that he has settled into his professorship in Cambridge and has no particular desire to return to the capital.
Still, with observers in the media sharing countless opinions about whether Summers is—or should be—a frontrunner for the job, it seems unlikely that the speculation will end anytime soon.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert D. Putnam, the author of Bowling Alone, a social science book on the deterioration of American community, on Wednesday received a prestigious award and met a really awful bowler.
Barack Obama, a graduate of Harvard Law School who once bowled a 37, honored Putnam at the White House for his work in "deepening our understanding of community in America," according to a statement released by the White House Office of the Press Secretary.
Putnam was recognized as one of 12 recipients of the National Humanities Medal for 2012. The award, which was presented to the recipients personally by the president, honors individuals or groups who have made significant contributions to the expansion and preservation of humanistic studies.
"Examining how patterns of engagement divide and unite, Dr. Putnam’s writing and research inspire us to improve institutions that make society worth living in, and his insights challenge us to be better citizens," the White House statement read.
Putnam has penned more than a dozen books, including the best-selling "Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community." At Harvard, Putnam teaches public policy courses to undergraduates and graduate students, and his research deals extensively with the decline of American community since the 1960s, particularly in terms of social capital. He also holds an appointment in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Putnam said in a phone interview Friday that he was "a little surprised" to receive an award typically given to humanists, but said his work with community falls in line with some "basic themes of the humanities."
Putnam added that his White House experience was "great fun," and that he was delighted to receive the award.
"I’m honored to be in such distinguished company, especially as a social scientist," he said.
Last year, Harvard affiliates received three of the nine National Humanities Medals awarded for 2011.
