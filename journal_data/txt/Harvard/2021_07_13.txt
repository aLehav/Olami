After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Murina,” directed by Antoneta Alamat Kusijanovic, the unpredictable waters of the Adriatic Sea reflect both the tranquility and turmoil of adolescence. Kusijanovic’s first feature film, it premiered on July 10 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival and was largely inspired by Kusijanovic’s 2017 short film, “Into the Blue” (which was well-received in the international film festival circuit).
Set on a rocky island in Croatia, “Murina” continues the story of Julija (Gracia Filipovic), a restless teenager living with an at-times abusive father, Ante (Leon Lucev), and apologist mother, Lena (Danica Curcic). A new horizon seems to appear for Julija when Javi (Cliff Curtis), her father’s wealthy ex-employer and sometimes-friend, comes to visit the family under the pretext of buying land from Ante and developing it into a resort. It is then that Julija decides she would rather replace her father with Javi, leading to a tangled mess of jealousy, hope, punishment, and desire.
In following the fraught relationship Julija has with her family, “Murina” focuses primarily on her struggle for control and her repressed desire to escape an environment in which she is forced to weather the often irrational wants and whims of those older than her. Filipovic’s portrayal of Julija is a mature one. For example, when Ante throws her off the boat because she warned him of dangerous rocks, she calmly swims back and rejoins the group, her expression more cold and unbothered than choleric, as if Ante’s antics were just a child’s game she was bored of. It is perhaps for that reason that “Murina” feels less like the typical coming-of-age film than it does a story of escape. While all the adults in her life — her mother, father, and Javi — are easily angered, reactive, and often hostile, Julija is reserved and stoic for the vast majority of the film. Only at the film’s climax does she finally reveal the depth of the emotions she had been harboring since the beginning, when she would otherwise suppress any reaction to the very clearly distressing and unfair behavior of those around her.
To aid her in untangling and exploring Julija’s situation and the relationships that hold her down, Kusijanovic finds a powerful narrative weapon in the ocean. Throughout the film, Kusijanovic strengthens the imagery of the ocean as a necessary aspect of Julija’s character. A talented swimmer and diver, Julija spends much of the film swimming or in a bathing suit, fresh out of the water. She goes swimming to detach whenever her family is overwhelming her, and it is what eventually provides her some sense of control over her life.
While the ocean does symbolize an escape for Julija, it is also representative of the obstacles that keep her shipwrecked in her family’s home. In many ways, the ocean’s grip on her is equatable to that of the men in her life, namely, her father — creating a complex and intriguing premise for Kusijanovic to work under. Ante capitalizes on her love for diving by routinely making her go spear fishing with him, an activity she says she “hates,” despite his claims otherwise. Further, the ocean is what threatens her life in the film’s last act, and when Ante forces a reluctant Julija to read a poem in front of a group of New York adults, it is a poem comparing the ocean to himself. Her father, like the ocean, is inescapable.
Kusijanovic also shows her flare for symbolism in other ways, such as her portrayal of the murina, or Mediterranean moray eel (which Julija and Ante hunt for), that she repeatedly uses to represent Julija herself. Perhaps most compelling, however, is Kusijanovic’s deep dive into Julija’s overwhelming restlessness. Through slow, lingering shots of a straight-faced Julija around her family, and through various displays of both Ante and Lena’s hypocrisy and emotional volatility, Kusijanovic creates a tense atmosphere for her audience, pushing Julija’s drive to escape beyond the screen. In the follow up to her critically acclaimed short film, the Croatian director shines yet again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Vogel is a terrible father. That, it seems, is the general message of “Flag Day,” a film starring Sean Penn (who doubles as director) along with his real-life children Dylan and Hopper. “Flag Day” follows the real-life story of Jennifer Vogel’s (Dylan Penn) attempts to cope with her father’s absences, criminal behavior, and spiraling web of lies — and somehow reconcile her perpetual disappointment in him with her lingering love for him.
Visually, “Flag Day'' is beautiful, and its ravishing montages illuminate the euphoria of John at his best. In an early nostalgic scene, silhouettes of Jennifer, her brother Nick (Hopper Penn), and John are viewed through blurry blades of grass, outlined against a golden sky with soft country music playing in the background. In another, we see colorful vignettes of the titular Fourth of July celebrations and fireworks above a glittering waterfront. The roller coaster highs and lows of having a charismatic, but absent and untrustworthy, parent is unfortunately common, and somewhere in the ethereal imagery of these scenes, Penn highlights that range of feeling with true emotional honesty. John constantly lets his children down, but it’s not hard here to see how his grand gestures are able to win them back — at least for a while.
In her acting debut, Dylan effectively captures Jennifer's competing feelings for her cruel father — of love, anger, disappointment, and, at times, hope. However, her performance tends to live mostly in emotional extremes; she does not react to her father’s disappointments with variety or nuance, instead opting for over-the-top screaming. Her ability to maintain that high intensity is impressive, but the lack of subtlety that comes with it leaves Jennifer’s character feeling irrational and underdeveloped.
Sean Penn's John is similarly disappointing. Given that Penn is both director and star, one would think he could manage to make John at least somewhat sympathetic. But surprisingly, he isn't. We are given no explanation or rationale for his compulsive lies and manipulation — no insight into his interior thought — and only see the effects of his actions on others. Penn certainly plays a convincing, and at times entertaining, con man, but he fails in giving his character the kind of genuine remorse or inner turmoil that could elevate him from villain to genuine human being.
Another weak point is the film’s dialogue, which is painfully clunky, rarely lifelike or believable, and full of cheesy moralizations and failed attempts at depth. It feels as though screenwriter Jez Butterworth was never given the old adage “show, don’t tell.” He constantly beats viewers over the head with obvious platitudes and exposition that would be (and often already have been) better illustrated by the plot itself. “My father’s misguided sense of pride seemed so endlessly wed to his own sense of shame,” says Jennifer in one unnecessary voiceover, belaboring a point already expressed through Sean Penn’s performance. In another, a policewoman waxes poetic out of nowhere to describe heroin use as “100 rehearsals for the ultimate rejection.” Combined with often exaggerated performances from Dylan and Sean Penn, the artificial style of the dialogue results in a high-emotion film that can feel more contrived than grounded.
The biggest problem with “Flag Day,” however, is its lack of purpose. It replays the same problems between the same two characters for nearly two hours. Dylan Penn’s Jennifer never quite finds peace or resolution, and Sean Penn’s John is never redeemed, remorseful, or truly humanized. The film’s portrait of the pain of loving someone who repeatedly lets you down is certainly compelling, but beyond that pain, “Flag Day” ultimately has little to say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Catherine Corsini’s “The Divide” begins with a series of late-night text messages. The marriage between protagonist Raf (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) and her wife Julie (Marina Foïs) is on the rocks, and Raf is acting out in a flailing attempt to get Julie’s attention. The vitriolic texts backfire, of course, but Raf continues to literally chase after her wife — breaking her arm and landing herself in the emergency room in the process.
Refreshingly, “The Divide”’s portrayal of a two-woman family is thoughtful and respectful, creating a normalized and loving portrait of two wives who are so much more than just queer. Raf is given a richer psychology, a more layered and multi-faceted personality, and a greater wealth of quirks and individuality in the film’s first five minutes than some queer protagonists get in an entire movie. Audiences learn from her unrestrained text messages that she is madly in love with Julie but shows that love in twisted ways; that she is desperate to save their relationship but doesn’t know how; and that she is volatile, immature, and struggles with self-control.
Julie, played by longtime LGBT advocate Marina Foïs, is arguably even more interesting. Julie’s character seems to be a thoughtful deconstruction of toxic masculinity among more butch-presenting queer women, who can feel the need to be stoic “protectors” so they can still “play the man” in the relationship and justify their identities to the outside world. Corsini both engages with that mindset and critiques it, showing how Julie’s attempts to protect Raf at her own expense and stoically weather Raf’s emotional volatility are unsustainable and make Julie deeply unhappy. In so many ways, it’s clear that this is a story written with a nuanced understanding of the joys and messiness of queer families, full of all of the little details someone just checking a diversity box would never think of including. That sensitivity is not only a testament to excellent storytelling from Corsini (who, herself, is an openly queer woman), but a reminder of why representation makes just as much of a difference behind the camera as it does in front of it.
However, “The Divide” is not primarily about queer identity, but an attempt at larger social commentary. Raf happens to be hospitalized on the same night as a major protest led by the gilet jaunes (“Yellow Jackets”), who were part of a French workers-rights movement in 2018 that fed on a frustration with government elitism and social inequality.
Corsini tries to address a melting pot of government problems — understaffed hospitals, police brutality, workers losing jobs for medical leave — that are overly broad, unfocused, and given no answers or resolutions. Arguably, Corsini just crams a multitude of social issues to craft a dramatic story, and, without offering solutions or resistance, merely normalizes these dysfunctions.
One example of this normalization is the character Kim (Aissatou Diallo Sagna), an exhausted nurse working her sixth shift of the week. Kim endures countless forms of abuse from her patients, from Raf's childish insults to extreme violence from a patient suffering from psychosis. Rather than challenging that bad behavior, Kim accepts it dutifully, even failing to press charges against a patient who held a knife to her neck and threatened to kill her for several minutes. She is rewarded for this apparent martyrdom — and even affirmed for it — by Raf, who says “I admire you.” By extension, it seems that Corsini too is praising and heroizing this behavior. This is actively unhelpful: psychologists who study burnout in medical professionals have often pointed to unrealistically high standards of productivity and perfectionism as one of the primary reasons nurses don’t complain about their working conditions or request better hours. With its many scenes of overburdened hospital workers, “The Divide” seems ostensibly designed as a call to action to support these hospital workers. However, by portraying the only nurse with a developed character as a superhuman saint, it’s more likely to make people “admire” healthcare workers than make sure they get the break they need. Additionally, by casting a Black woman to play Kim, Corsini is normalizing a longstanding cultural stereotype of Black women as long-suffering care-givers who will always put the needs of others above their own.
By forcing the upper-class, often out-of-touch Raf to share a wall and waiting room with a protestor who’s been shot by police, Corsini seems to be aiming for a message of togetherness — along the lines of “we’re not so different as we seem.” But not only is that point made with heavy-handed and too-convenient storytelling, it also offers cheap absolution for people on one side of the aisle and no real answers for the oppressed workers. The wealthy and ignorant Raf leaves the hospital feeling better about herself after she is educated by Yann (Pio Marmaï) on the systemic inequality and police brutality he has experienced. Yann, on the other hand, is not nearly as well off as he rushes off to drive a truck with a still-injured leg. Not much change or introspection is required of the central Raf in order for her to achieve a happy ending and implicit moral redemption; and, by extension, it seems that not much is required of audiences, either. As a result, the film feels more like a self-gratifying absolution of the French elite than a genuine attempt to problem-solve the issues that led to the gilet jaunes protests.

A federal judge ruled last month that a defamation lawsuit filed against Harvard and the former director of Harvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab over tweets he posted in 2018 can proceed.
Francesca Viola, a former journalism professor at Temple University, filed the suit against then-Nieman Lab Director Joshua Benton and Harvard in March 2020. She alleged privacy intrusion and defamation after Benton used his administrative access to reveal that Viola was behind several anonymous comments posted to the Nieman Lab’s website, then posted the comments on Twitter with her name.
In his June 28 ruling, District Judge Leo T. Sorokin denied parts of Harvard’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, but allowed several counts to proceed.
Sorokin wrote in his decision that Harvard is “vicariously liable” for Benton’s actions, given that he plausibly acted within the scope of his job at Nieman.
Still, Sorokin dismissed Viola’s allegation that Benton violated Harvard’s privacy policies, given that the policies she cited do not apply to the Nieman Lab’s website.
Benton — who founded Nieman Lab within Harvard's Nieman Foundation for Journalism in 2008 — and University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment for this story. An attorney for Viola also declined to comment.
According to her complaint, Viola — under the display name “truthseeker” — posted a comment on May 4, 2018 in response to another commenter who criticized a Nieman Lab article published that day titled “People Who Are Delusional, Dogmatic, or Religious Fundamentalists Are More Likely to Believe Fake News.”
“I am a journalism professor at a major east coast university and I completely agree with you. I follow Nieman but this is an article designed to insinuate that 1) Trump supporters who happen to be religious are delusional 2) conservative media that don’t tout the democrat party talking points are disseminating ‘fake news.’ I will no longer use Nieman as a source,” Viola’s comment on the Nieman Lab website reads.
Later that day, Benton published a chain of tweets on his personal account displaying comments posted by the “truthseeker” account and attributing them to Viola. The comments included her response on the May 4 Nieman Lab article as well as additional posts on other publications’ sites authored by “truthseeker.”
“I think that this attitude — permanently rejecting a news source because it accurately reports something you don’t like — is exactly what you want in a journalism professor, yes? Also, spell our name right, Francesca Viola of Temple University,” Benton wrote in the first of his tweets, all of which remain public.
At the end of his thread, Benton tagged the Twitter accounts of Viola’s employers and colleagues.
Viola’s complaint states Benton had the ability to view email addresses of commenters on the Nieman Lab website and wrongfully used this access to identify Viola, her employer and colleagues, and previous comments posted under the “truthseeker” name.
Viola alleged that Benton’s disclosure of her identity violated Harvard’s privacy policies, and that his actions constituted defamation.
According to her suit, initially filed in Pennsylvania and later transferred to the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, Viola lost her job at Temple and experienced “severe emotional distress for which she has sought counseling” after Benton’s tweets drew significant attention from the media and colleagues critical of her comments.
On May 9, 2018, Benton issued an apology on Twitter for sharing Viola’s identity, workplace, and comments without first reaching out to her.
“By revealing such details without making an effort to contact her and seek confirmation and explanation, and otherwise adhere to rigorous reporting methods, the tweets did not meet Nieman’s journalistic standards. I apologize and regret my error in judgment,” Benton wrote.
Sorokin also wrote in his ruling last month that Viola “plausibly alleged that Benton may have been negligent in his failure to verify that she was the author of the truthseeker comments,” allowing libel and defamation counts to proceed.
On another website that uses the same third-party comment-managing service the Nieman Lab uses, the user “truthseeker” posted a comment on an article, which referenced Muslims praying for Ramadan, stating: “Scum. Deport them. They hate us. Get rid of them.”
Benton included that tweet in his thread, referring to her as its author, but Viola denied in the suit that she wrote this comment.
Viola acknowledged her authorship of other comments by “truthseeker” in Benton’s tweet thread, however, including one promoting a conspiracy theory accusing the Democratic National Committee of murder and another falsely claiming that Donald Trump won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election “because of some illegal votes cast [for Hillary Clinton] in California.”

Members of Harvard’s graduate student union voted 61.5 percent in favor of a two-month contract extension last week, accepting the University’s offer to extend the contract to Aug. 31 as the two sides remain deep in negotiations.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers Bargaining Committee put the contract extension to a union-wide vote after a committee vote split 5-5. A total of 714 members, or 35 percent of eligible voters, voted on the extension between July 6 and July 9, according to HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla.
Besides depleted benefit funds that have to be renewed by a new agreement, all provisions of the current contract will now be maintained through Aug. 31, including access to arbitration through the grievance procedure and the no-strike clause.
Mancilla said the extension vote did not represent “a radical situation or change.”
“Extending the contract for two months and having something in writing in order to sort of secure some assurances from the administration, through the grievance procedure, through access to orientations lists, et cetera, I think that that was what most people were more comfortable with,” Mancilla said.
The vote opened after the union’s monthly general membership meeting last Tuesday, during which rank-and-file members asked Bargaining Committee members questions about the extension and discussed it among themselves, according to Mancilla. The union discussed the vote further at separate organizing committee meetings.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Sunday that the University is “pleased” that the union accepted the extension and “looks forward to future bargaining sessions.”
“As we’ve said previously, we remain committed to reaching an agreement that addresses the University’s and HGSU-UAW’s priorities,” he wrote. “The University will continue to negotiate in good faith, both at the main-table and within several small working groups, and looks forward to future bargaining sessions.”
HGSU-UAW steward Zeke Benshirim ’19 said he supported the decision to put the extension to a union-wide vote, though he ultimately voted against it.
“It shows a commitment to democracy,” Benshirim said. “It makes me happy that I’m part of a democratic union that makes official decisions representing its members’ voices.”
After attending the general membership meeting, Benshirim said he also talked with other students in his department before voting against the extension to “send the message that I want a better contract now.”
“I’m not unhappy with the results overall because I know this allows us to continue using the formal grievance process for our members over the summer and to keep organizing with minimal disruption as we fight for a better contract,” Benshirim said.
Currently, the union and the University have tentative agreements for five of their contract articles: employment appointment security, workspace and materials, job posting, family friendly benefits, and the employee assistance program. None of the most contentious issues, however, have been resolved, including wages, health benefits, union security, and procedures for handling harassment and discrimination complaints.
“We just hope Harvard comes back to the table ready to bargain a better contract,” Mancilla said. “We’re moving a lot on a lot of the less contentious issues, I would say. These small groups have been very productive, especially on getting language that we both agreed on done, but on the major issues we’re still pretty far apart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Anthropology professor Theodore C. “Ted” Bestor died July 1 at the age of 69 after a long battle with cancer.
Bestor, who served as Reischauer Institute Professor of Social Anthropology, was a specialist in contemporary urban Japanese society and culture, with a focus on Tokyo. His major works include books “Neighborhood Tokyo” and “Tsukiji: The Fish Market at the Center of the World.”
Bestor joined Harvard’s faculty in 2001, having previously taught at Columbia and Cornell. Bestor served as chair of Harvard’s Anthropology department from 2007 to 2012 and director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies from 2012 to 2018.
Anthropology department chair Ajantha Subramanian wrote in an email Sunday that Bestor inherited the chair position during a “very turbulent time” for the department, and responded by “ably and wisely” guiding it through a structural transition. She wrote that he continued to contribute to the department even in the final year of his life.
“Even during the last year of his illness, he remained as active a member of the faculty as he could. The last time I saw Ted was on June 10th when he Zoomed into the doctoral defense of his last PhD student,” she wrote. “We stayed on for an extra 20 minutes to be able to talk with Ted who was his usual wry, philosophical, and engaging self even while struggling for breath.”
“Ted was a teacher, mentor, colleague, and friend to many of us in Harvard Anthropology and we will remember him well,” she also wrote.
Anthropology professor Arthur Kleinman, a longtime colleague of Bestor’s, wrote in an email that he would remember the positive impact Bestor had on the field of anthropology and Harvard.
“Ted was committed in a serious and enduring way to the Department of Anthropology, to Harvard, to Japanese and Asian studies more broadly, and to his students and colleagues,” he wrote. “His presence and contributions, despite the problems of the last few trying years, will not be soon forgotten.”
The recipient of many accolades, Bestor received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese government for his contributions to the study of Japan, as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Anthropological Association’s Society of Urban, National, and Transnational Anthropology in 2017.
In 2018, Bestor stepped down as director of the Reischauer Institute after a Harvard investigation found he had committed two counts of sexual misconduct — one verbal and one physical — during an interaction with a female professor at a 2017 conference at University of California, Los Angeles.
Bestor told The Crimson in 2020 that he took “full responsibility” for his actions at the conference, calling it a “one-time isolated incident” that he attributed in part to his struggles with alcoholism.
A 2020 investigation by The Crimson also revealed at least two other women had also accused Bestor of sexual misconduct as early as 2013, and multiple people had raised concerns about him to the University’s Title IX office. In response to the reporting, Bestor denied those allegations and said he was unaware anyone had raised concerns about him with the Title IX office prior to the incident at the conference.
Bestor was born in Champaign, Ill. in 1951 and moved to Seattle as a child. He first visited Japan in 1968 when his father taught as a visiting professor in Tokyo.
He graduated from Fairhaven College of Western Washington University in 1973 and received two master’s degrees and a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1983.
Bestor is survived by his wife and colleague Victoria Lyon Bestor, son Nicholas, and brothers William and Thomas.
