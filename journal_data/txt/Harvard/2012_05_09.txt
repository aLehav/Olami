After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students are no strangers to a demanding schedule. As the stress level on campus reaches a fever pitch during finals period, many turn to caffeine to stay awake and productive. Some, however, seek out more dangerous substances. Last week, The Crimson published an article documenting the manner in which some students abuse Adderall—a prescription drug used to treat attention deficit disorder—as a study drug. Adderall helps the mind focus and be more productive, so that taking it, students are reportedly able to pull off impressive intellectual feats, such completing a course’s entire reading in a matter of hours.
Illicit Adderall use should be regarded a serious problem on campus, one that carries the potential for serious widespread abuse. Students should consider turning to drugs of this kind to be unethical, if not a deplorable last resort to be shunned. The use of Adderall compromises one’s academic integrity. More menacingly, if this habit becomes normalized on a campus, it would put pressure on all students to abuse Adderall or other similar but less fashionable substances, just to keep up with their peers. This is a frightening prospect, especially considering the noxious health effects of Adderall.
The physiological and psychological consequences of abusing study drugs are harmful and well documented. Adderall is an addictive amphetamine, classified by the Drug Enforcement Agency on a par with cocaine and opium as a Schedule II controlled substance. Abuse of Adderall has been linked to rapid weight loss, long-term cardiac problems, and even an increased risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia. Some might say that Adderall is simply a study aid, no worse than caffeine. There is, however, a difference that ought to be clear to all between a simple cup of coffee and a controlled substance that can lead to hospitalization.
Thankfully, the wrongful use of Adderall does not yet appear to be widespread. According to a survey of graduating seniors published by The Crimson last year, slightly less than 7 percent of students on campus have ever used a study drug. Yet the Harvard administration should recognize the severity of the problem, however small, and its potential by mounting a strong effort to publicize its strict policies on controlled substance abuse in general and the harmful side effects of Adderall in particular. Recently, the student body witnessed the administration’s vigorous promotion of its new alcohol policy. In the case of Adderall, while the stakes appear to be higher, the University’s position has been far more muted.
While we would be amiss to overemphasize the problem, it is not implausible that if Adderall abuse proliferates and goes unchecked, it could fast become a problem that spirals out of control. If students feel pressured to use a performance-enhancing substance just to stay level with their peers, particularly in competitive and curved classes, a campus could rapidly find itself ridden with an unseen and destructive type of pharmaceutical arms-race among its undergraduates. Certainly, our studies should be taken seriously. But surely the last thing we would want is to end up like the Chinese high school where teenagers were put on IV drips of amino acids so that they could continue to study without collapsing from exhaustion.
Students who misuse Adderall, and in doing so cause grave harm to their own bodies, seem to miss the fundamental point of what a college education means. Grades matter, in many cases a lot, but once our four years at Harvard conclude, we should all hope to emerge better, more wholesome people. Putting one’s health and academic integrity at risk for the sake of academic performance is myopic and unethical at best, and lethal at worst. By abusing Adderall, students not only put themselves at risk, but also degrade the value of the education they receive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent months, it has become a trend to decry the apathy of Harvard students. Christine Hurd wrote in the Harvard Political Review Dispatch about “Harvard Political Apathy.” Anita J Joseph wrote in The Crimson, “We got into Harvard by showing respect—nay, devotion—to social rules, and rebellion just isn’t in our blood.” And the Crimson staff itself opined, “Harvard’s culture simply does not lend itself to creating the levels of concerted protests seen recently at Berkeley and University of California Davis.”
There are plenty of apathetic students at Harvard. As a student activist, I have encountered students who agree with the end goals of protest but are uncomfortable with direct action as a means of enacting change. I have spoken with others who simply don’t agree that workers deserve higher wages and Wall Street bankers lower. The Harvard student body could certainly be more mobilized and activist. However, articles that deny the existence of student activism are not only inaccurate, but also destructive.
In fact, Harvard students do mobilize around the issues that they care about—and student activism at Harvard is stronger than it has been for at least a decade, and maybe half a century. This past year saw one of the largest student mobilizations in Harvard history: hundreds of people showed up to the first night of Occupy Harvard. Some of these protestors were faculty, workers, or perhaps curious bystanders, but the one hundred and twenty Harvard students who slept in Harvard Yard on the first night of Occupy certainly demonstrated commitment to a cause.
In fact, 1969, often cited as an era of “true” student activism, was not all that different from 2011. The group from Students for a Democratic Society that occupied University Hall in April 1969 was made up of three hundred and fifty student protestors. Many of the twelve thousand students who marched to Harvard Stadium and eventually voted for a student strike disapproved of SDS’s radical actions; however, they were motivated by horror at the decision of President Nathan M. Pusey ’28  to call four hundred police officers to brutally evict student protestors from University Hall, arresting hundreds and sending dozens to the hospital with injuries. When similar police violence took place at the University of California Berkeley and University of California Davis campuses this fall, students at those universities mobilized as well. I am certainly grateful for the 2011 Harvard administration’s decision to simply lock the gates of Harvard Yard instead of sending police to brutalize student protestors. However, that decision undoubtedly contributed to students directing frustration against Occupy Harvard instead of against the Harvard administration or the police.
Before a journalist suggests, yet again, that Harvard students never put their feet on the ground about issues they care about, I think it’s important to point out the impressive nature of this school year’s student activism. In the fall, students from the Trans Task Force and Anti-Imperialist Movement  protested President Drew G. Faust signing an agreement that brought Naval Reserve Office Training Corps back on campus. The students of the Environmental Action Committee and Students for a Just and Stable Future travelled to Boston and Washington D.C. with the Tar Sands Action Campaign to protest against the Keystone XL Pipeline; meanwhile, the Global Health and AIDS Coalition held multiple actions all year calling out both Senator Scott P. Brown and Merck & Co. for their failure to support global health goals.
While students staged a walkout of professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s Economics 10 lecture and prompted Goldman Sachs to cancel recruiting events at multiple colleges, Occupy Harvard maintained a tent city in Harvard Yard for over two months. Other students concerned about economic justice organized with library workers to demand no layoffs in the restructuring process. The Palestine Solidarity Committee held a one-day hunger strike in solidarity with Palestinian administrative detainees; black student groups organized a rally for Trayvon Martin. And just last Saturday, Harvard students joined with feminists from around Boston to protest the War on Women. Moreover, this year’s student campaigns have been successful: In response to student demands, Harvard not only halted future investments in HEI Hotels and Resorts but also funded cage-free eggs in the dining halls and sustainable jobs for Harvard’s food service.
When Harvard students are organizing around issues ranging from labor rights to environmental sustainability to global health to justice in Palestine to queer and women’s rights, it seems ludicrous to suggest that our campus is politically apathetic. Denying the existence of student activism demeans the organizing done by student activists on Harvard’s campus, discouraging future activism and discounting true victories.
Not every sympathetic student will come to every action—after all, even those who strongly believe in direct action understand that the largest march must be complemented by weeks or months of organizing—but Harvard undergraduates have a pretty good track record so far. So let us recognize, and celebrate, the achievements and victories of student activists at Harvard this past year—and let’s spend the summer researching, planning, and organizing for another year of making our campus, and the world, a better place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Commencement Day approaches, advice to graduates can be found in words of congratulations in the yearbook, videos of past commencement speeches, and even articles that reveal what graduation addresses “don’t tell us.” At first glance, these pieces of advice seem to follow a predictable template that tries to illuminate, through examples both trivial and serious, how we should lead our lives going forth. A closer look at this reveals two types of advice that have fundamentally different implications on the meaning of happiness and the role of education.
The first type is perhaps epitomized by Steven P. Jobs’ famous commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005 that concluded with two imperatives: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish.” Through examples of the failures and ultimate success in his own life, he urged graduates to pursue their dreams by believing in themselves and aggressively overcoming obstacles. Although motivational, Jobs’s advice to graduates to strive for a life of the utmost degree of individuality seems to presume that the goal of education is to enable the pursuit of happiness through individual success alone.
The second type of advice foregrounds the importance of morals and ethics that come with education and sees graduates as individuals connected to the world by what they have learned about the past and what they can determine about the future. This type of advice suggests, though often subtly, that pursuing happiness is only significant when happiness comes from endeavors beyond the individual. In his brief note to the class of 2012 in the yearbook, Professor Peter J. Burgard from the German Department writes that we should “never stop grappling with challenging texts” as a way to “act ethically.” While we have to “pursue the good life,” happiness is “not good enough” in a life without reflection, courage, and honor. This type of advice urges us to think of education as a continuous human endeavor built upon reading texts and engaging with the world—engaging with what has happened, and even more importantly, what has been undertaken and thought by moral and intelligent people in the past—in order to change the beliefs we take for granted and to act morally.
This type of advice emphasizes that the “good life” should be defined by morals and ethics and not just pursuing success—success being a natural consequence of the knowledge and analytical skills we have acquired. To paraphrase another commencement speaker, David Foster Wallace, the true value of a liberal arts education goes beyond teaching us “how to think” to enabling us to choose “what to think,” meaning that it should allow us a closer glimpse of truths in order to decide what is right and then to act on this knowledge even when we are inclined to do otherwise. In practice, this means taking classes that challenge our fundamental beliefs, changing our beliefs after critical engagements with texts, ideas, and knowledgeable people, and keeping what we know at the forefront of our existence as adults on a regular basis. Acting morally and ethically at all times as an educated person would inevitably, through things big and small, make the world a better place, and only the happiness that comes with this moral engagement with the world is worth pursuing.
Yet education is more often viewed merely as the necessary preparation for a life of personal success, while it should really be about engaging with the world, utilizing the knowledge we gain from this engagement, and opening up our defensive, self-interested minds to effect positive change in global, national, and local issues. The lessons from our Ethical Reasoning requirement should really be taken away as “things that regularly influence how we think” instead of merely “things we know.” Indeed, the world needs scientists, economists, bankers, and influential figures like Mr. Jobs, but all these people play larger and more important roles as citizens, community members, parents, and educators. Fulfilling these roles in a moral and enlightened way is an imperative of education that far surpasses personal success in importance.
Beyond the scope of college, this type of advice reflects fundamentally upon the idea of education and learning in general. What prevalent mentalities on education lack is an emphasis on its moral, ethical, and humanistic dimension. Education is neither merely the necessary path one must take in order to become a professional and achieve financial success nor a “battlefield” in which competition is necessary for individual gain. If every student in a classroom had so-called “tiger parents” and always had to “win,” the whole foundation of education would fall apart as the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to a selfish endeavor. If educators, parents, and students at all stages acknowledged that the goal of education is to enable a moral life based on knowledge and truth, education systems the world over could be more equal and instill in students the true value of learning—a value that is not only revealed at college graduations, but also guides our actions before, during, and beyond our years of formal education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many students at Harvard, I spent most of my childhood immersed in books. For most kids, books, movies, television shows, and the stories those mediums tell are more than enjoyable entertainment; they are formative and influential experiences that contribute significantly to children’s development. Although not all forms of entertainment are intellectually stimulating and some can actually inhibit development—especially television and movies—other forms that show us a new perspective, place, emotion or idea can be valuable. Education is conventionally defined by the time and effort we spend in school, working toward a degree. But as a recent New York Times article suggests, activities such as reading fiction that engage our minds in a more imaginative way are educational in their own right. Such pastimes affect how we experience and interact in real life, expanding our emotional intelligence and individual creativity in an increasingly impersonal and homogeneous society.
In a culture that is saturated with television shows, blockbuster movies, and other seemingly frivolous forms of entertainment, the forms of entertainment that can provide a nontraditional and nonacademic education are being greatly undervalued. At a place like Harvard, people often consider taking time away from our classes and homework to read for pleasure or to watch a television show wasteful. Students constantly feel the need to justify taking such a break, guilty that we are not using that time to do homework instead. Even when students do take that time, they usually turn on an episode of “Jersey Shore” instead of reading the novel that has been collecting dust on their shelves. Given the perceived luxury of pleasure reading or television watching, students are much more likely to turn to a “light” form of entertainment over something with more intellectual value. If our society emphasized “stimulating” entertainment rather than the superficial and expanded our conception of education to include nontraditional activities, perhaps students would be more inclined to pick up that book for entertainment and for their own educational development.
In some ways, those hours spent reading a book or watching a movie are even more impactful on intellectual, moral, and behavioral development than what is traditionally considered “educational.” School and classes may provide students practical knowledge and the necessary experience to work in a particular field, but their experiences outside of class will help them realize how they want to apply that knowledge. Our ability to interact with others, to find our place in society, and to understand ourselves is nurtured by experiences that are not strictly academic. In an increasingly complex society dominated by interpersonal relationships, emotional intelligence is just as important as academic and conventional intelligence. After all, it influences how we handle the social interactions and problems that we face on a daily basis.
The problem is choosing those forms of entertainment that are both enjoyable and valuable. Reading, especially, exposes us to the kinds of situations, people, and evocative experiences that we will face in real life, and thereby increases our ability to navigate such circumstances. Stories provide us with a sort of pseudo-reality that mimics the emotions and choices of real life—we relate to the characters we read about in books and see in movies and television, and we unconsciously empathize with them. We are naturally disposed to absorb the experiences we see in a fictional setting and relate it to our own lives, learning from the characters’ successes and failures, triumphs and tribulations. This sort of entertainment can influence not only individuals, but also large societal groups. For example, a recent Vanity Fair article examined the effect of the hit early 2000’s drama, “The West Wing,” and how it inspired positive action by the next generation of policy-makers, instilling in them an idealistic mission to change Washington.
We need to orient our culture and our perspectives to appreciate all kinds of intelligence and education. Despite the apparent benefits, it is easy to dismiss all entertainment as superficial. Much of what is presented in our media is superficial and of little value. But why not elevate the positive and enduring forms of entertainment above the rest and acknowledge the importance, if not necessity, of enjoying them? School is only one part of our education and students should not feel like they are slacking off or neglecting their education by sitting down with a good novel or turning on an episode of The West Wing. To reach the highest potential that we are capable of achieving it is important to take time to develop all parts of ourselves.
So do yourself a favor—take a break and pick up that novel you’ve been meaning to read. There’s nothing wrong with getting lost in a story for a while. You may not be the same when you come out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Dunster Grille, students pay $3.50 for mozzarella sticks. But only a few block away at Eliot Grille, another student with the same late-night craving pays $4.00, due to price discrepancies that exist between the four grilles in undergraduate houses.
Despite the discrepancies, grille managers said that business has not suffered, as their unwitting customers are generally unaware of the price differentials, and favor the convenience of grille food.
The four grilles—located in Dunster, Quincy, Eliot, and Pforzheimer—independently set the prices for individual menu items based on the cost of each item and its popularity among students, according to incoming Quincy Grille manager Margaret Jiang ’14.
Managers at Quincy, Dunster, and Eliot Grilles all noted that the most popular menu item is mozzarella sticks. Though the full menu offerings are identical from house to house, at the Quad and Dunster Grilles, a serving of mozzarella sticks costs $3.50. In Quincy, the order costs $3.75. Eliot charges the most with its $4.00 order.
Across the menu, Dunster and the Quad offer the cheapest food, while Eliot and Quincy tend to be pricier, charging as much as a dollar more for certain items.
Though all four house grilles order ingredients from Sysco—the food supplier used by Harvard University Dining Services—some grilles make a profit while others struggle to cover the cost of purchasing food and paying employees.
Elena M. Pepe ’13, one of the Eliot Grille managers, said that Eliot Grille was shut down during the fall semester of 2010 because it could not cover its costs.
But now Eliot Grille is currently turning a profit, and that its management hopes to lower prices soon, Pepe said.
Dunster Grille, which has not had the same success, relies on a yearly $1,000 boost from Dunster HoCo, according to Golbari.
Golbari said that Roger and Ann Porter, Dunster House Masters, support the Dunster Grille because it fosters house spirit, and the students who run the Grille host community events like game nights and movie nights.
“The Porters wanted to make the Grille a House thing.... We provide food for study breaks and Dunster Happy Hours,” said Golbari.
Dunster Grille caters largely to its own residents and Matherites, while Leverett residents tend to frequent Quincy Grille instead.
“[Quincy Grille] offer some of the cheaper late night food in the Square and [we] try to keep it that way,” wrote Quincy Grille Manager Mackenzie L. Luick ’13 in an email. “We do have to account for extra costs such as being able to pay our employees well too.”
As the most centrally located of the grille locations, Quincy Grille makes a consistent annual profit.
“During the week, it’s mostly Quincy residents and people studying in Quincy dining hall [at Quincy Grille],” said Luick.
According to Jiang, the managers typicall split the profit—which totals at about $1,000—at the end of the year.
But now they are looking to use that profit to further enrich house life, Jiang said.
“We’ve [been] trying to institute this ‘Quincy Grille gives back’ program because we want to improve Quincy life,” Jiang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an era of increasing workplace pressure, a new book by Harvard Business School professor Leslie A. Perlow encourages companies to create policies that allow employees to break the 24/7 work habit.
In “Sleeping with Your Smartphone,” which will be released later this month, Perlow addresses the harmful effects of a work culture that requires employees to respond to work demands at home, during weekends, and on vacation. Through a survey of over one thousand managers and professionals, Perlow found that 26 percent slept with a smartphone, while 70 percent checked their smartphone within an hour of waking up each day.
According to Perlow, career pressures often keep individuals tethered to their mobile devices, even if the work itself is not urgent.
“You can turn off, but that doesn’t mean that everybody else turns off,” she said.
Though Perlow acknowledges that institutional change is a large-scale endeavor, she said she believes that work habits can evolve if company employees make little improvements within small teams.
“We have tremendous power as a team to take ownership of our work time and make a difference along the way,” Perlow said. “My message is that you, on your team, tomorrow, can make a difference.”
“Sleeping with Your Smartphone” centers around a 2007 experiment that Perlow conducted on a small team of Boston Consulting Group employees. Team members were each assigned specific nights to be “off” from work, in which they were not expected to respond to their smartphones or email.
The employees also engaged in weekly discussions about changes that they observed in their productivity and satisfaction.
According to Deborah N. Lovich, who managed this first team that collaborated with Perlow, employees involved in the experiment were 75 percent more likely to report envisioning themselves at BCG for the long-term.
“We found that people who were working in this new way were happier on every dimension of job satisfaction,” Lovich said.
She continued that employees within teams learned to prioritize their work and gained more control over their personal lives—leading to a more enjoyable work experience. Since Perlow’s first experiment, the team-building initiative has grown within BCG and is now being implemented within their offices in Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Chicago, and London, according to Lovich.
“It was really quite viral,” Lovich said. “In 2007, I did the first experiment with my own team; by the end of this year, this will be something in place in most of BCG’s offices around the world.”
Lovich, who is now the head of consulting and business services at BCG’s Boston office, said that Perlow’s recommendations have helped the company retain its key staff. She added that she expects more companies to embrace Perlow’s strategy for achieving a better work-life balance.
“This is rolling out of BCG because it works, and I suspect it’ll go elsewhere,” Lovich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I and Part III of this story appeared on May 7 and May 11, 2012.)
Students headed to summer school most likely imagine long days in stuffy classrooms filled with their least favorite academic subjects instead of their favorite summertime activities.
Most students probably do not envision the lush trees and historic red brick buildings of Cambridge. Nor do they expect top teachers culled from schools across the country, creative projects rather than remedial reviews, and other cutting-edge educational methods designed to generate enthusiasm among students.
Yet this is what happens when Harvard resources meet public summer schools.
The University supports two summer programs catered to Cambridge high school students. The first, Crimson Summer Academy, brings approximately 90 high-achieving, economically disadvantaged students from Boston and Cambridge to live in Harvard dorms and take rigorous classes for six weeks each summer. Students pass through a highly selective admission process to win a spot in the three-year CSA program.
Just a few blocks down Broadway, more than 300 high school students prepare for the coming school year at the University-funded Cambridge-Harvard Summer Academy, Cambridge’s sole high school summer school and a joint project of Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and the Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Teacher Education Program.
CSA and CHSA, both funded by the University President’s Office, have garnered much attention since they were established in 2004 and 2001, respectively. Through these innovative programs, the University and the community help students to excel long after the summer ends.
CLOSING THE GAP
Waking up in his dorm room in Weld from a nap after his morning statistics class, Regal Sealy glanced at his clock to discover that he was an hour and a half late to his expository writing class.
Frantically, Sealy packed his backpack, ran through the Yard, rushed past Annenberg, and slowed as he entered CGIS.
He apologized to his instructor, who told him not to worry.
“It was a little different, the amount of time you [had] between classes,” Sealy says.
Sealy, the child of immigrants from Panama and Barbados, is a senior at the Academy of the Pacific Rim in Boston, and for the past three years he has attended CSA in hopes of becoming the first person in his family to go to college.
CSA students, known as Crimson scholars, spend weekdays in the summer taking classes and participating in activities on Harvard’s campus. The highly selective free program draws many students from Cambridge public schools—many of whom had spent time on the federal Department of Education’s watch list due to poor standardized test scores.
The program accepts about 30 students each year, with an average family income of $28,000, according to CSA Director Maxine Rodburg.
CSA started in 2004 as part of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which eliminated family contributions for full-year students with incomes less than $40,000 and boosted recruitment of low-income students.
“The programs have evolved with what the needs are and have helped CPS’s efforts to address the achievement gap and inspire students,” says Thomas J. Lucey, Harvard’s director of community relations for Cambridge, speaking about both CSA and CHSA. Rodburg says that CSA aims to expose students to college opportunities and help them prepare to apply.
“It’s not a pipeline to Harvard but a pipeline to increase the opportunity of higher education at highly selective institutions among local students,” Rodburg says.
Since graduating its first class in 2007, CSA has helped nine of its graduates enroll at Harvard. Students have also attended other Ivy League schools and top-tier universities. For the first time, CSA students are headed to the west coast this year: two students will attend Stanford in the fall.
Rodburg takes CSA students on New England college road trips during February and April break.
Sealy says that before going on the trip, his top priority for a college was that it have a city campus. But as soon as he stepped off the bus at Williams College, he fell in love with the rural atmosphere.
“You never know what you’ll miss out on,” says Sealy, who will matriculate at Williams in the fall.
Doreen M. Kelly-Carney ’85, a college counselor for CSA who previously worked as a Harvard admissions officer and a freshman proctor, says the exposure to other schools is one of the key components of CSA. Last summer, she advised Eda Kaceli, a senior at Boston Latin School, to keep Harvard on her wish list.
“I didn’t think I would get into Harvard, but [Kelly-Carney] was very encouraging. That was exactly what I needed to hear,” says Kaceli, who applied to 15 schools. She was admitted to Harvard, which was her first choice, and will enroll in the fall.
Even though many of the students in the program live in Cambridge, some had not visited Harvard’s campus before CSA.
Tobias J. Estime ’13, a first-generation college student, did not consider applying to Harvard until after his third summer at CSA.
“[CSA] helped me direct my focus to colleges and universities, particularly liberal arts,” Estime says. “I thought to myself, well, if I get in, I’ll be excited, but if not I’m applying to nine other schools.”
CSA requires students to take a college preparatory class and teaches them about interviews, essays, and the Common Application.
A major difficulty in creating the program, Rodburg says, was crafting a curriculum that would not overlap with any of the 34 Boston and Cambridge schools from which CSA accepts students.
In the first year of the program, students take a quantitative reasoning course, a writing course, and an elective, and in the following summer, they can choose a science course and other electives. In the third year, students choose their own math and expository writing courses offered through the Harvard Summer School.
“At school, classes were easy enough to go through. CSA was like something else. Quantitative reasoning really gave me trouble. I was like, maybe I’m not as smart as I thought,” Sealy says.
CSA students also meet three times a week before classes with mentors who are Harvard students or CSA graduates.
Mentors continue to help CSA students beyond the summer, including providing weekly homework help.
When applying to colleges, Sealy says he reached out to CSA graduates to ask about their college experiences.
In its early years, CSA benefitted from a grant from Goldman Sachs, which allowed CSA graduates to return to the program to take classes during the summer after their senior year of high school. Although that grant no longer exists, many CSA graduates, including Kaceli and Sealy, wish to return as mentors.
AN INNOVATIVE SUMMER
Instead of a history paper or a biology worksheet, an assignment at CHSA might be a family history narrative or a mock trial about genetics. This project-based learning is supported by teams of teachers, often three or four in one classroom—one veteran educator and several student teachers from Harvard’s Teacher Education Program.
As the official summer school of Cambridge, CHSA primarily serves students who failed classes in the previous school year. Others enroll in the same classes voluntarily to take extra courses for enrichment.
These innovative classes attract teachers across the nation. This summer, teachers will come to CHSA from Los Angeles, Denver, and Philadelphia.
Amanda Dillingham, a teacher at East Boston High School, says that the program is well known in Boston. She will teach at CHSA for a third summer this year.
“I’m tired of being asked, ‘Why do I care? Why do I need to learn this?’ [and being told,] ‘I don’t care. I don’t care,’” Dillingham says. That frustration led her to come up with the mock trial method to teach her summer school students about genetics.
CHSA is directly connected to Cambridge’s public high school as well as its two charter high schools and one Boston school, Cristo Rey, but any student in Cambridge, including those who attend private schools during the year, can apply.
While originally the program was geared toward cramming remedial course content into students’ heads, former co-directors Kyle J. Hartung and Drew M. Echelson decided to revamp the curriculum in 2010 to focus on project-based education. The new approach has received much praise from the school community.
“I want to credit the folks at the academy for taking that feedback and improving it so the students are doing less of the drill and kill and more of the project-based learning,” says Cambridge Superintendent of Schools Jeffrey Young.
Brendan Kells, a teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School who serves as co-principal of CHSA, says that the new method does not attempt the nearly impossible task of teaching a summer school course as if it were a regular class.
“You can’t condense all of U.S. History II in six weeks,” Kells says.
Instead, Kells asks his students to interview their family members of different generations and then write about their relatives’ experiences in the context of the historical events of their generations.
Since working at CHSA, Dillingham has tried to incorporate more project-based learning into her classroom during the school year as well.
CHSA was the brainchild in 2001 of Katherine K. Merseth, who directs the Teacher Education Program at the Ed School, and Paula Evans, the former principal of Cambridge Rindge and Latin.
Teacher Education Program participants have their first student teaching experiences at CHSA, where they work under experienced mentor teachers. The Ed School students gain teaching experience and high school students benefit from the lower student-teacher ratio. Merseth calls it a “win-win.”
The experienced and novice teachers motivate each other. “Working with inspiring educators, there is a certain energy and excitement that renews some of your faith and challenges you to take some risks in the classroom,” Kells says of his shared classroom time with new educators.
Every teaching team leads one course for two hours, then spends another two hours assessing their work.
At the end of CHSA, students present their projects at an exhibition night. Local residents are invited, introducing community members outside of the school system to the summertime collaboration between Cambridge schools and Harvard.
Administrators of CSA and CHSA say they hope their innovative summer schools to be used as models for other cities, and Cantabrigians who spent their summers as Harvard students hope for others to be able to share the enriching experiences.
“I just wish there could be more Crimson Summer Academies. It changed my life,” Sealy says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New details have been released regarding the death of a primate in a Harvard Medical School research lab in October 2011.
The primate, which has been identified as a marmoset, died in the New England Primate Research Center in Southborough, Mass. after escaping from its cage, being caught with a net by NEPRC staff, and undergoing an imaging procedure.
The marmoset was being used for research on aging, according to John J. Pippin ’71, director of academic affairs for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a non-profit organization that advocates for alternatives to animal research.
The marmoset was among the five primates that died in the past 21 months at the NEPRC, which recently received a citation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture concerning the death of a cotton-top tamarin monkey in February.
Dean P. Jones, a professor of medicine at Emory University and the lead researcher of the project involving the marmoset, confirmed the details which Pippin had found on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website.
According to Jones, the NEPRC study aims to learn more about how the body’s chemistry changes as it ages so that researchers can ultimately find solutions to the physical frailty that comes with aging.
Jones said that marmosets’ life span, typically 15 years, allows researchers to study chemical changes from marmosets’ birth to their death in a shorter time period than is possible with humans. Jones said the study is observational and not harmful to the animals. To collect data, researchers place  marmosets, which are native to South America and grow to about eight inches long, in tubes to prevent movement while they are scanned with an EchoMRI machine, a medical device that provides body composition analysis.
But Pippin said that he believes the marmoset’s death is “part of a pattern of lax oversight and faulty protocol and poor performance that is characteristic of the NEPRC.”
Pippin pointed to observational research being conducted on humans at Washington University in St. Louis, Tufts University, and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center as evidence that the use of animals is unnecessary.
Pippin also released a Nov. 29 letter sent to the National Institutes of Health by Richard G. Mills, executive dean for administration of the HMS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
In the letter, which was obtained under the guidelines of the Freedom of Information Act, Mills acknowledged the “corrective actions” recommended by a HMS IACUC subcommittee.
The letter recommends that researchers also submit additional information including a plan “to address issues arising when an animal either escapes from its cage or appears to struggle in the tube,” as well as “a description of methods of placement, including alternate methods that may be used.”
After the animal’s death research was temporarily suspended until corrective steps were taken. Research has since resumed, according to Jones.
The Harvard Medical School declined to offer more details on the case.
“Humane and regulated use of non-human primates in medical research benefits humankind through countless lifesaving therapies and interventions that are developed through ethical research,” the Medical School said in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess,” an adaptation of the 1935 opera, scooped up ten Tony nominations last Tuesday, second only to “Once,” the musical version of the eponymous 2006 film.
The production, which premiered at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge last September before moving to Broadway in January, was nominated for “Best Revival of a Musical.” Director Diane M. Paulus ’88, who serves as the Artistic Director for the ART, received a “Best Direction of a Musical” nomination.
“I was completely overwhelmed,” Paulus said. “When you work on a project, you’re never thinking about this moment, but when it happens it’s such a moment of recognition.”
In addition to those two nominations, the production received nods for four of its actors and its costumes, sound design, lighting design, and orchestrations.
“The recognition of the whole show—that was such an honor,” Paulus said. “The nominations are a great tribute to everyone involved.”
According to Paulus, “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” diverges in both score and dialogue from the original opera, which featured music composed by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, and a libretto by Heyward, who based the work on his novel “Porgy.” Paulus collaborated with Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Suzan-Lori Parks and composer Deirdre L. Murray on the adaptation.
“Our interests were to build a production that could stand side-by-side with the opera,” Paulus said.
These revisions, which were given the blessing of the estates of Gershwin and Heyward, were not welcomed by all. Hilton Als, who reviewed the ART’s production for The New Yorker, noted that the composer Stephen Sondheim expressed disapproval at the thought of revising the opera.
However, according to Paulus, “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” allowed for greater exploration of the characters than had been seen before.
Though concerns about the depiction of African-Americans in “Porgy and Bess” have been raised since the work’s 1935 premiere, serious complaints surfaced during the 1960s, when some viewers argued that the opera’s broad, often simplified characterizations perpetuated racial stereotypes.
“[The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess] is a production that allowed for the strengthening of the arcs of the characters,” Paulus said.
Paulus emphasized the importance of the nominations not just for the production and the ART, but for the university as a whole. She noted that Harvard students were connected to the show in different ways, including enrolling in an English class on “Porgy and Bess” that she co-taught with Visual and Environmental Studies Professor Marjorie B. Garber last spring. According to Paulus, teaching the course “English 198: Porgy and Bess,” was important to how she approached the production. In addition, ten undergraduates worked on the show in the summer of 2011.
“It’s a moment of recognition for the arts at Harvard,” Paulus said. “It’s a real tribute to Drew Faust’s commitment to the arts here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a bronze medal in the U23 World Championships and a fourth-place finish at senior worlds, Andrew Campbell established himself as the top U.S. single sculler in the summer of 2011. At that point, Campbell’s doubles partner Will Daly was a sweep rower with his eyes set on the U.S. lightweight straight four.
But it didn’t take Daly, who said he generally “only sculled a few times a year”, long to pick up the trade, and now he and Campbell are the top lightweight double in the country. The pair will race next weekend in Lucerne, Switzerland to try to earn a spot in the Olympics.
For Campbell, the transition was natural. There is no lightweight single event in the Olympics, making the lightweight double a logical event choice for top lightweight scullers.
But for Daly it was less straightforward.
“For me, it was a really hard decision,” Daly said. “I’d invested a lot in the four and wanted to see it do well.”
But Campbell and Charley Butt, coach of both Harvard lightweight crew and the U.S. lightweight double, had identified Daly as potential partner for the sophomore. And when Butt gave Daly the invite, the 2006 Boston University graduate and former Riverside Boat Club rower decided to return to his home waters.
“It looked like the best opportunity for me to go to the Olympics and try to do well,” Daly said.
Despite the fact that Daly had done the bulk of his training in sweep boats, he advanced in sculling quickly and finished second behind Campbell in the lightweight single at the USRowing East Coast Fall Speed Order.
But as Campbell explained in the fall, speed in the single does not always translate to double dominance. And so, Campbell and Daly headed to New Zealand to search for speed.
“A couple weeks, we decided to give the flipped lineup a try and it ended up going really well,” Campbell said.
The new lineup put Daly in stroke and Campbell in the bow.
“Will is a natural racer,” Campbell said. “He thrives in a racing environment. It’s awesome to have him in stroke. It adds a level of competitiveness to our makeup.”
With their newfound speed, Campbell and Daly were able to keep pace with the New Zealand men’s heavyweight pair and Kiwi women’s heavyweight quad much more successfully.
“Something clicked,” Daly said of the new lineup. “We struggled for a while to keep up [with the pair and quad], but after that we were right there, so we were really excited about it.”
“We got in a lot of hard steady state along with very competitive team-wide pieces,” Campbell added. “Our speed improved dramatically. Day in, day out, skirmishing with the pair forced us to be fast.”
By the time the duo arrived at the U.S. non-qualified Olympic trials, they had three regattas and months of training alongside fast national team crews under their belt.
“That gave us a big advantage,” Daly said. “We were much more comfortable, we knew what things worked, what things didn’t. By the time we got to trials, we were going through motions of what we had already established.”
On April 12, they won the regatta with over a six second margin of victory, allowing them to finally shift their sights to the goal of competing in the Olympics.
But even more so than at the U.S. trials, they are truly facing the unknown in Switzerland.
This final qualification opportunity features entries from all of the countries that were unable to qualify at the 2011 World Championships in Bled, Slovenia. The fact that none of these crews have qualified does not indicate a lack of speed. Neither Campbell nor Daly competed in the lightweight double in Bled, and other countries could similarly feature rowers who had previously competed in other events.
“It’s hard to say what the field will look like,” Campbell said. “People place a premium on going to the Olympics and will do a lot of crazy things to get there.”
“It’s going to be a hard regatta,” Daly said. “The regatta itself is very stressful. We’re going to be with people. Some are going to be in a better position, some in worse. We just have to stay in our own bubble, do what’s been working for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tommy Amaker has put together a number of strong recruiting classes during his five years as the Harvard men’s basketball coach.
But there’s a chance the members of the future Crimson class of 2017 could put them all to shame.
On Monday, national recruiting analyst Evan Daniels reported that Stephen Domingo—the No. 28-ranked recruit in the class of 2013 by ESPN.com—has narrowed his list of colleges to four: Stanford, Washington, Georgetown, and Harvard.
Domingo, a 6’7” wing with a sweet shooting stroke, was one of eight prospects to visit Cambridge this past fall.
Another four-star prospect from the high school class of 2013 has kept Harvard on his short list as well.
Nigel Williams-Goss, a shooting guard ranked No. 68 in his class by ESPN.com, told National Recruiting Spotlight on Saturday that Washington and Harvard were his two leaders.
If either Domingo or Williams-Goss were to pick the Crimson, he would be the highest rated prospect ever to select Amaker’s Harvard squad.
That honor currently goes to Zena Edosomwan. An athletic power forward ranked in the top 100 by Scout.com, Edosomwan turned down offers from UCLA and USC to pick the Crimson and will arrive in Cambridge in the fall of 2013.
Edosomwan could be joined in the Class of 2017’s frontcourt by 6’8” forward Alex Foster. ESPN.com’s 31st ranked power forward in the high school class of 2013, Foster visited Harvard this past fall along with Domingo and Edosomwan.
During the visit, Foster tweeted, “Looks like I know where I’m going for college.”
And in April, he announced that he will “most likely” commit to the Crimson over Tennessee, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Minnesota if he receives the necessary scores on his ACT.
But as Amaker has learned the hard way, that can be a big “if.”
Four-star prospect Pe’Shon Howard, a member of the high school class of 2010, told Sports Illustrated in 2009, “If the admission office clears me, I’m going to Harvard.”
But things didn’t work out for Howard, and the shooting guard ended up at Maryland.
The Crimson has had a number of other close calls as well. Top-100 prospects Rod Odom, Dwight Powell, and Andre Hollins all had the Crimson among their final choices. But the trio ended up going elsewhere, settling on Vanderbilt, Stanford, and Minnesota, respectively.
But if the Crimson can get Domingo, Williams-Goss, and Foster to join Edosomwan in the Class of 2017, it will make those near misses a whole lot easier to forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, the Ivy League and NBC Sports Network announced an extension of their television partnership through the spring of 2014. The agreement commits the network to televising between six and ten football and men’s basketball games, and up to four men’s lacrosse games.
“We are pleased to showcase more Ivy League competition nationally to our passionate fan base which has a thirst for Ivy League athletics,” said Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris in a statement released by the Ivy League on Monday.
From the perspective of a fan of Ivy League sports, I’m pleased about the prospect of showcasing our athletes to audiences across the country. But as the league seeks out higher levels of national exposure, it appears caught between two masters: the pressure to excel as a sports conference and the pull of tradition to maintain the status quo.
Now, I would have no problem with the Ivy League remaining a small, nationally trivial sports conference if Ivy administrators truly believe their mission to be enforcing the highest of academic standards for all students. But the expansion implied by the extension of this TV deal suggests quite the opposite. And on the surface, I think that’s fine too; but if that’s really the path down which the Ivy League is traveling, it needs to discard its reliance on tradition as a primary method of determining policy.
By this, I don’t mean to denigrate the place Ivy sports occupy in history, but there’s a difference between appreciating history and blindly adhering to tradition. I marvel at the fact that Harvard played a central role in the founding of intercollegiate sport, given the place that college athletics currently hold in the national consciousness. The championship banners in Harvard Stadium, for instance, help us understand just how far sports have come in the last century and Harvard’s place in that development. Yeah, we really did win a football national title in 1919; that’s an incredible feat that I respect.
But there’s a reason we don’t do most things the same way now that we did in 1919: it was 1919. One year later, our university investigated and expelled eight students on charges of (gasp) homosexuality. I think it’s fair to say that the times, they have a-changed a bit in the interim. Using “tradition” as the primary reason for doing anything is perilous, because it implies little more than “that’s how we’ve always done it” as its justification. The passage of time should be an opportunity for evolution, not stagnation.
Which brings me to what is, in my view, the most egregious example of the Ivy League’s deification of its own tradition: the ongoing obstinacy of Ivy leadership to allow its teams to participate in the FCS football playoffs.
First, I should address the other, more practical arguments made for restricting Ivy League football play to just the regular season, which I believe are all untenable. Too much missed class time? Ivy football teams’ seasons run for 10 weeks; for comparison’s sake, Harvard’s basketball team played for 20 weeks. The playoffs might conflict with exam schedules? That’s the case for many spring sports teams, including men’s lacrosse, which this year has two Ivy teams in a field of 16 vying for the national championship in late May. The playoffs would diminish the importance of the regular season? Football is the only varsity sport for which the Ivy League has disallowed national postseason play.
That leaves us with tradition. The comments of Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman during a push for postseason play a few years ago reveal a viewpoint singularly out of touch with reality.
“If the focus of competition became postseason play, we would inevitably lose some of that great tradition,” Tilghman told the Daily Princetonian in March of 2006.
Presumably, Tilghman was referring to the tradition of maintaining the importance of intraleague play. The Ivy League championship is a prestigious honor, the thinking goes, and to set a goal above that—a national championship—would cheapen that distinction.
But what, other than the importance we attach to tradition, could possibly make a title earned against seven other teams more prestigious than one earned against 121 others? To me, this screams of the elitist, “exclusive club” atmosphere that the Ivy League is often accused of representing. Let the gentlemen have their own competition, apart from the squabbling of the masses.
Why limit the heights a team can achieve for the sake of an abstract non-reason like tradition? It’s important to understand and honor our history, but not at the cost of sacrificing the opportunity to write new chapters in the history books. Personally, I’d like to see a new banner hanging on the old cement of our stadium: 2019 National Champions.

Despite New York Knicks fans’ recent hopes that Jeremy Lin ’10 would pull a Willis Reed, surprising the basketball world by coming back from a severe injury and willing his team to victory, it was announced on Tuesday that Lin will not play in his team’s first-round playoff series against the Miami Heat.
Following the Knicks’ practice, interim head coach Mike Woodson spoke to the media about Lin’s unavailability.
''Speaking with medical and Jeremy, he will not play in this series,'' Woodson said. “He’s just not physically ready to play.”
According to reports, Lin has been able to shoot and work out without significant pain, but swelling and tightness has consistently occurred after the fact, rendering his return at all this season highly unlikely.
The Harvard alum, who tore his meniscus with a month remaining in the regular season, is now one of three guards for the Knicks to have to undergo significant knee rehabilitation in the offseason. He is joined by Iman Shumpert and Baron Davis.
New York will have to take on the Heat, who lead 3-1 in this best-of-seven series, without a majority of its backcourt. Woodson stated that veteran Mike Bibby will now start at the point guard position.
After winning Game 4 on Sunday night, the Knicks will look to stave off elimination once more on Wednesday in a pivotal Game 5.
