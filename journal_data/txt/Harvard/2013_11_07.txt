After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A middle-aged guitarist, dressed in black from head to toe, sang passionately as a train to Braintree approached. He waved his hands in the air and winked to acknowledge his audience. As I circled around him, appreciating his music and attempting to make sense of what exactly he was saying, he quickly caught on that I was lingering for a bit longer than usual. He smiled at me and gave me a thumbs-up, and as soon as he finished his song, approached me with a smile and said hello.

 
He introduced himself as Jay Scott Henderson, and I asked him where he had lived prior to finding himself singing on a subway stop in Cambridge. “That’s a good question. You know, I was floating around for a while,” he begins. “I kept seeing this planet—this blue thing—and said that maybe one day I’ll go there. While passing Neptune, I decided to drink of its blue inert gas. I sat down on Mars, and I saw Saturn receive its crown—and I eventually wound up in this place,” he continued with a mischievous smile on his face. “But where am I from? Not sure, but Neptune was cool though. I tried to bring some of that gas here on Earth, but they’d probably lock me up for that.”
 
He says the first time he heard his voice in the shower at the age of four he loved it so much that he was confident that singing was something he wanted to do forever. He soon started writing songs and performing everywhere that he could, and eventually ended up frequenting T stops. “I write my own songs but I also borrow material from others. But I guess we all borrow from people—I borrowed some genes from my dad, some from my mom. We all borrow genetics, just like I borrow my music,” he says.
 
His favorite song to perform is “When Earth Was Blue,” which he sometimes calls “When Earth Was All Blues” or “Sky Blues”— depending on his mood. “The song is about all these synthetic things on this earth, like genetically modified food, that make it hard for us to claim the Earth. But who owns the Earth? We all do, we all really do. The Earth is all of ours, so let’s enjoy the apples that grow on the trees and not genetically modified things.”
 When we ended our chat, Henderson reminded me to love everyone (and taking his own advice called me “beautiful,” which I obviously appreciated). As I walked away I noticed him smiling as he continued to sing. I couldn’t help but smile myself.

In an email sent last Wednesday, the Winthrop House masters announced that Winthrop will be the fourth House to undergo construction (and the second to undergo full renovation) as part of Harvard’s multi-billion dollar House Renewal project. Its renovation, due to take place in 2016-17, will follow a one-year pause in construction after work on Dunster in 2014-15. Although the prospect of modernized upperclassman housing is an exciting one, it is crucial—especially for a project of such magnitude—not only to assess and learn from past projects but also to develop strategies by which to maintain high-quality facilities into the future.
A need for upkeep and restoration is to be expected in century-old buildings, but the scope of the problem in houses such as Winthrop is unacceptable. Residents report the presence of cockroaches, non-functional electrical outlets, and disintegrating window frames. Harvard’s unparalleled yield and the disconnect between freshman and upperclassman housing reduce the importance of high-quality facilities as a draw for prospective students, but this is not a justification for allowing facilities to rot—in some cases literally. Regular maintenance in future years would serve both to make incremental improvements to House conditions in the short-term and to reduce the severity of the need for another major renovation project many years down the line. The bottom line is that Harvard housing should not be permitted to reach Winthrop’s current level of disrepair. Winthrop is a beautiful house with a wonderful layout and an impeccable community. The upkeep of its physical plant should reflect that.
We opined in September on the renovation of Old Quincy (now Stone Hall) and continue to believe that while it was an overall success, it is a project to be improved upon rather than repeated. Despite the beauty of the renovated space, its replacement of some traditional suites and their private common rooms with “cluster common rooms” along hallways was met with a lukewarm reception and even outright criticism. With suite-style living so integral to the upperclassman experience, it is important that future restorations take student feedback into account and enhance current suite-style arrangements instead of removing them altogether.
Between the renewal of the Houses and the planned Allston expansion, it is certainly an exciting time to be at Harvard. However, to make this experience as constructive as possible for the university and students alike, it is imperative that upcoming renovations both look back on and learn from those of the past and develop strategies going forward—such as more frequent and thorough House maintenance—to avoid the issues that necessitated this project in the first place.

“What Makes a Leader?”“How Can We Foster Leadership in Students?”“Seven Traits That All Successful Leaders Have.”No matter what the headline, the message remains the same: leaders are the only ones who count.
Along with “social media,” “innovation,” and “changes in technology,” “leadership” has become a buzzword associated with wealth, success, and accomplishment of near-universal interest. In fact, as a social media intern this past summer, I was told, “Put the word ‘leadership’ in the headline. That’s what gets people to click.” Why? Because everyone wants to learn how to be a leader, even though leaders are not necessarily what the world needs.
As Harvard students, we’re subjected to a uniquely intense pressure to exemplify the leadership that our parents, teachers, and even our friends seem to expect of us. We are saddled with the responsibility that comes with going to an institution known for producing graduates—and dropouts—like Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and seven US presidents. Many feel an obligation to at least strive to follow in their footsteps. After all, we went to Harvard—if we don’t at least lead in our chosen field, we’ve failed. To be a leader is to make a difference. To make a difference is what it means to succeed. Right?
Wrong. Upon closer examination, the seemingly obvious tie between being a leader and making a difference is not nearly so clear-cut. Left out of the oft-repeated leadership narrative is the fact that every group is composed of both leaders and followers—and both are vital for success. By brushing over the contributions of followers, we create only a generation of self-important leaders-to-be, all desperately vying for control in their need to live up to expectations of leadership.
In fact, the recent government shutdown in Washington, D.C., so often billed as a “crisis in leadership,” could rather be a crisis in followership: A situation in which everyone felt that they should be acting as a leader, while failing to accept that, sometimes, being a follower can advance the greater good.
In reality, every change in human history was predicated on a collaborative effort between leadership and followership. Rome was not erected by kings. The Nobel Peace Prize this year was awarded to the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons—not an individual, but a group that accomplished the most to advance world peace. Even the Civil Rights movement could not have succeeded without the hard work of on-the-ground activists as well as the revered figureheads. Here at Harvard, things aren’t all that different. For example, final projects in the popular introductory computer science course CS50 are products of collaboration between students and teaching fellows and staff—innovative solutions to social problems that rely on both leaders and followers.
As poet Bertolt Brecht laments in his poem, A Worker Reads History, “Who built the seven gates of Thebes? The books are filled with names of kings. Was it the kings who hauled the craggy blocks of stone?” Whether recorded or not, followers shaped history as much as leaders did.
Change comes from working together to create a larger movement. Everyone wants to be a CEO and a leader and the “face of the movement,” the one who goes down in history books as truly remarkable. But true change is never accomplished alone. Rosa Parks was merely a representative of the NAACP, a fighter in a larger movement for change. Change comes from teamwork, from a web of effort rather than a single person.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Barbara Kellerman, author of the book Followership, believes that the democratizing forces of technology and globalization are flattening any remaining hierarchies. In an interview, Kellerman said, “It should not be a universe of leaders. It should be a universe of global citizens.” If we want to cultivate a world of global citizens, intent not on the personal glory associated with being the “leader,” we must recognize the value of being a follower. Both leaders and followers are fluid categories that should allow for shifting of power between the two. If the ultimate goal is a better world, maybe it should not matter so much who is doing the leading.
You do not have to be a leader to matter. If you are truly passionate about making a difference, perhaps it is time to let go of the delusion that you must be a leader. Perhaps it is time to learn the value of following.

As an institutional force, the labor movement has failed. Union headquarters in Manhattan might be across the way from Goldman Sachs. Yet there is no parity between labor and finance in the money game, or labor and management in the organizing game. The movement’s 2011 recall campaign against Wisconsin governor Scott Walker came to naught, as did its attempt to enshrine collective bargaining rights in Michigan’s state constitution. Last year, only 11.3 percent of the workforce belonged to a union. The movement is locked in a negative-feedback cycle. After each defeat at the ballot box, conservatives and corporate types smell blood in the water, and grow bolder in their drive for right-to-work laws and other curbs on labor. Union membership drops. The process repeats.
For the most part, labor is not to blame for its shortcomings, mainly the product of countervailing historical forces. In 1935, Congress passed the Wagner Act, which granted private-sector workers the right to form unions, collectively bargain, and strike. Growing in number, unions eventually counted one-third of the American workforce in their memberships.
In 1947, the rules were changed. With the approval of the Taft-Hartley Act, secondary strikes were prohibited, right-to-work laws allowed, and communists forced from the union. Bereft of its ideologues and robbed of useful tools, the movement was defanged and institutionalized. Labor, helmed by conservatives, hung to the back of the 1960s civil rights struggle, inspiring a biting critique from folk-singer Phil Ochs. The unions lacked the vital energy to even defend themselves, as automation and globalization ate away at hard-won gains and decimated the ranks.
In the seven years of famine that have been the past three decades, Pharaoh has never starved—and it’s not because he stored the country’s grain. Institutionalized, unions developed their own bureaucracies, with outrageous perquisites for bosses—million-dollar salaries, food allowances, chauffeurs, junkets. Executive excess, aside from its tawdriness, has impeded remedial action.
If it is to survive, American labor must abandon the suites for the streets, putting a renewed focus on grassroots organizing and popular education. It must adopt an ethos of confrontation and unconventional tactics, working outside systems that structurally disadvantage labor.
The union authorization process, with its ample opportunities for employer intimidation and appeals, has become one of these systems. Hearkening to the era before the Wagner Act, some have stressed collective action for better wages and working conditions over the traditional organizing push. At Wal-Mart, where numerous unionization efforts have stalled, the United Food and Commercial Workers has sponsored OUR Walmart, a non-union organization, which has encouraged the store’s associates to vent their frustration through day-long strikes. Fast-food employee advocates have urged similar strategies.
A return to the pre-New Deal model should exclude a return to the period’s ideology or aesthetics. Labor is not going “to bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old,” nor will the Wobbly dream of “one big union” ever be realized. Clenched fist salutes, renditions of  “Solidarity Forever,” and shouts of “the workers united never will be defeated” are hokey and anachronistic. Too often, this iconography is shamelessly appropriated—a phenomenon evident on our own campus—and meaningful activism lost in the welter of spectacle. How to inspire today’s workers in the absence of yesterday’s messianic, socialist vision is a problem of considerate proportion, and it vexes labor as much as other progressive movements.
The self-aware leftist, of course, need not discard the labor songbook. Scores of Woody Guthrie tunes are as relevant to the Walmart superstore as they once were to the assembly-line. During the Occupy Wall Street protests, Guthrie’s music was a common refrain. Labor’s success, however, depends on the evolution of new modes of expression for working-class desire and angst.
Only with a renascence of proletarian culture is there hope of raising the class-consciousness of the American worker. We, in the United States, as has been observed time and time again, view class as fundamentally malleable. In a contemporary idiom, labor culture could undermine these assumptions, which are insidious to items of popular consumption.
Labor doesn’t need its own buildings if it has Goldman’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent editorial titled “Don’t Police Speech,” (November 4, 2013), The Crimson has pronounced last week’s disruptive protest at Brown against New York City Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly HKS ’84 to be “ill-conceived” and—even worse!—“ill-mannered.” We thought the protest was quite well conceived and excellent; we’d have done the same as them.
Despite being “troubled” by the stop-and-frisk policy, The Crimson defends Kelly’s right to speak in the name of “freedom for the thought that we hate.” We disagree with the notion that Kelly was censored when members of Brown University and the surrounding community began challenging him. Kelly, by virtue of the powerful position he holds, has access to a “platform” whenever he wants one. His voice is already all over the press; harder to find are the voices of his critics.
The Crimson casts the problem with stop-and-frisk as one of “balance” between “incursions of liberty” against people of color on the one hand, and “maintaining order” on the other. But whose “order” is maintained by stop-and-frisk? Does a young black or Latino man feel that “everything is in order” after he’s been manhandled by a cop for no reason? Does this racial harassment leave communities of color with a sense of “good order”? Liberty is not to be traded for order; rather an order that threatens liberty is to be resisted, to borrow a phrase from Malcolm X, by any means necessary.
The Crimson writes, “Kelly has unquestionably reduced crime in New York City.” In fact, a number of detailed studiesdiscredit Kelly’s claims about the effectiveness of stop-and-frisk. Furthermore, reports have shown that NYPD crime reporting is replete with manipulation that makes its programs look more effective. One also wonders if the people of New York do not “question” the commissioner’s success, given that one of his few high-profile critics, Bill de Blasio,was just elected mayor  in a landslide.
We must take issue with this contention that the ideal way to debate policy is by politely talking about whatever powerful people have decided to talk about according to their rules. Is it not clear that we have not a worse, but a far better debate on stop-and-frisk precisely because those who have been hitherto marginalized have forced themselves into the discussion? The Crimson editorial, with its “unquestionable” citations and identification of “order” with order for whites, is itself a demonstration of this basic inequality. And if one side of the debate is treated unequally from the start, all talk of protecting “free thought” is tendentious—one cannot protect what isn’t there.
We extend our solidarity, and our thanks, to the students and community members who protested Ray Kelly. If more were like them, we would have a better and freer society.

The first thing I learned about Owen Beane, as I sat in Chameleon Tattoo and Body Piercing waiting for him to arrive, is that he is a consumate professional. He doesn’t break out of that professionalism, I’m told, even when his colleague shows him hand-drawn penises while with clients.
“Step into my office,” Beane invites with air-quotes around “office,” before explaining that the cushy chairs just outside the glass doors of Chameleon do not in fact constitute an office. This was the first of many phrases he would qualify with air-quotes.
Long hair, full beard, a hoop in his septum, a flower stud below his lip. Upwards of six feet tall and quite thin, he wears a black t-shirt revealing two arms sleeved in dark blue/black ink tattoos, with open circles exposing each elbow. On the knuckle of his right pinky is the letter “O,” and the rest of his name is spelled out across the next three fingers: O-W-E-N. He holds a Fruit and Nut Delight Kind bar.  He asks my permission to grab a coffee before the interview, and returns with a venti iced from the Starbucks downstairs—no, it’s not black.
When he graduated high school in 1996 (he was born in ’78, making him 35 now), “dyeing your hair crazy was the thing...grunge was the thing,” Beane explains. “Looking the way I wanted was more important to me.” CVS had about as little interest in hiring him as he had in being hired by CVS. “People would just be like, ‘nah.’”
Beane let it slide, even though he couldn’t afford being discerning. “I didn’t have a fallback plan,” he admits. “But I needed to look the way I wanted to look. And I was planning on being a rockstar too, so I was like, I don’t have to worry about that.”
Out of high school in Manchester, MA and from a musical family, Beane enrolled in a year-long sound engineering program that didn’t require SAT scores, “which was important for me,” he added, chuckling, “because I didn’t take ’em.” While in school with some student loans, he hung around Chameleon, where his music buddy, Greg, had landed a piercing job. Noticing that Beane was strapped for cash, Greg made a proposition: five bucks a day to take trash out and clean tools, if they even had customers.
“And it wasn’t like, ‘sweet, I’m an apprentice,’” Beane said. “I was just like, ‘yeah, whatever, that’s cool. I’m gonna be here anyways, so I might as well.’” He recalls that it seemed like an insignificant choice at the time.
After about a year, Greg asked him if he wanted to be an actual apprentice.
While a part of him had hoped to work as close to music as possible, Beane came to understand how little control the people he interned for had over the music they worked with and how much they struggled on a daily basis to make ends meet. They’d begin work at 2 p.m., and never quite knew when they’d finish for the night, sometimes 2 a.m., sometimes noon the next day.
As he explains it, he agreed to learn the piercing trade because he loved music “too much to risk ruining it” for himself.
The nature of the piercing business has evolved immensely over Beane’s 18 years inside it. When he began working in the ’90s, piercings were generally a gay subcultural phenomenon, and many days at Chameleon saw no customers. The turn of the millennium saw two additions to pop culture: Baywatch (in which Pamela Anderson displays a navel piercing) and Aerosmith’s music video for Cryin’ (in which Alicia Silverstone gets her navel pierced). Suddenly, piercing had entered the mainstream, and people got off Beane’s back about when he would put in another application at CVS.
One day about seven years ago—which Beane cites as piercing’s peak—he set a personal record of 61 piercings in a day. “Not a happy day,” he sighs. People waited three hours between signing up and being pierced, forcing Beane to apologize to the pissed-off before even beginning the usual process of gaining trust. Each had fewer than five minutes, and no chance to reconsider placement or jewelry choices.
Beane takes pride in Chameleon’s shift to prioritizing quality over quantity. Now that he’s manager, he demands at least 15 minutes per piercing. On nine- to 10-hour weekdays the store usually serves 10-15 clients, while Fridays and Saturdays can mean as many as 25 or 30. While he still actively works to gain each client’s trust, many people he pierces have been referred to him specifically, so that part of his job is already half-done.
As the piercer’s world has changed, so has the world of the piercees. Students have become an essential client base.  Harvard students specifically, however, didn’t jump in until about six years into the boom. He says you could tell when we began to show up. Our representatives seemed more intellectual than the typical customer and almost never talked of parties or any “social stuff.” They exuded an air of superiority, which Beane is quick to defend as probably earned, because “you’re not gettin in there unless you got brains.”
Over the past five years or so though, Beane has seen a change in the Harvard students eager for his services. They seem more open to the bohemian style, focused on fashion, and chatty about last night’s party or someone’s trip to the hospital. They now express interest in visible piercings beyond the safe nostril and ear choices.
While he sees the lines increasingly blurred between customers from different schools, Beane does have something to say about how most Harvard (and perhaps MIT) students differ from our counterparts from other schools in the Boston area.
“It’s totally not fly by the sea body modification,” he explains. “It’s way more, like, deliberate, approaching it from a really analytical mind.”
Beane admits that he is making generalizations. However, as a Harvard student having recently pierced my tragus at Chameleon—a move that 1) the boy from high school I was about to end a relationship with did not support and 2) would mark the first thing I did without asking my mother— accompanied by my straight-laced varsity athlete pre-med freshman roommate for her last-day-of-classes-release/rebellion of a cartilage piercing, I would say his understanding is pretty astute.
“I take an interest in the people that I work on,” he says. “I try to bridge the gap a little bit and be like, what’s your world like? And let me teach you about my world.”
By the end of the hour that Beane has spent talking to me, he commands the cushy chairs just outside the glass doors of Chameleon with an openness and ease that could’ve convinced me we had been sitting in his office all along.
“‘Fake it til you make it’ kind of diminishes what I’ve done,” Beane says, before slowly conceding, “but it… kinda… sums it up.”

I try not to drop the T-bomb if I can help it. I get on just fine by saying I have three siblings and letting people’s polite interest in my past be satisfied. Months or even years later, it’ll slip in by accident. People who think they know me inside and out discover that I am an entirely different personn—that they’ve never known the real me. At least, you’d think so based on their reaction when I say, “Yeah, I was skyping the other night with my twin—oh shit.”
Once someone finds out I have a twin, the next 20 or so seconds of conversation are fairly predictable. Step 1: Denial. “What? No way!” This tends not to last long, but you’d be surprised at the convincing I’ve had to do. Step 2: Incredulity. “I can’t believe I’ve known you all this time and I’m just finding out you have a twin! This changes EVERYTHING.” Step 3: Blaming. “Why didn’t you tell me this when we first met?” Step 4: Awe. “Wow. It must have been great growing up with a twin. It must have been really special for you.” Step 5: The question which without fail terminates the conversation: “Identical or fraternal?” Step 6: Disappointment. “Oh, you’re fraternal? Well…ok.”
Indeed, we are the boring kind of twin. I have a brother who happens to only be 25 minutes older than me, with nothing crazy like mind reading or zany comedic value. My twin is shorter, blonder, and sweeter than I am, and sometimes we hardly seem related. I’m convinced we wouldn’t have been friends at all if we hadn’t spent most of our lives (and then some) in such close proximity.
But tell us a joke and we’ll glance at each other and gain quick, tacit approval to find it funny together. We’re less chatty than you’d think because we’ve already had most conversations and there isn’t much more to say that we don’t already understand. He’s not merely a brother who happens to be the same age as me. There’s something added into the mix. Sharing a womb, crib, bed, and bunk bed through freshman year of high school turned our lives into a logistical dance of close proximity which we resolved with surprising ease—except for that one lego he left out that tore a bloody crater into my foot. We shared space and bumped elbows and talked into the night, and as a result we’re somewhere on the spectrum between friends, family, and self.
So when my twin flew out for our joint 21st birthday last year, I seized the opportunity to introduce my other half to my college friends who thought they knew me. At the party we threw in my room, I wanted to stand up on top of a table and point at my brother and yell, “This! This, right here!” Instead, I trotted him up to my closest friends one by one and introduced him: “I’d like you to meet my twin.” They immediately launched into feverish conversation while I retreated a bit, giving them space but watching them out of the corner of my eye. They glanced at me every so often with a mix of amusement, approval, confusion and understanding. Far too soon my friends went back to mingling and my twin rejoined me, and it took all of my willpower not to grab their scalps and force their heads back together until I felt they truly knew each other. People haven’t met me until they’ve met my twin.
College has changed the two of us. Nascent bits of our personality surged under our newfound independence. We haven’t stayed in as close contact as either of us would have hoped. In the past, we didn’t have to try in order to know what was going on in the other’s mind at any given moment, so we made no such efforts. Of course spending three years apart has caused our lives to diverge, and yet we communicate electronically as if we still saw each other every day. Sometimes, it’s difficult to know whether we’re just kidding ourselves into thinking we’re as close as we once were, or if there is some nature within us that is both shared and immutable.
Last week was my 22nd birthday. I pushed myself up and back into the booth at the bar, marginally diminishing the babble of my celebrating friends around me. My finger caught on the cracks in my phone screen as I dialed my twin. It was 12:05 AM in Cambridge, making it 10:05 PM the day before in Colorado, where he goes to school.
“Hey, man. Guess who’s the older twin now?”
He was waiting for this. “Yeah, well, you’re gonna die before me so enjoy it while it lasts, grandpa.”
This banter is our consolation prize for being apart. But I heard the raucous noise of celebration on his end and he heard the huddled friends at the bar on mine. We’ve carved out two distinct spheres for ourselves, which in itself seems kind of unbelievable. “Listen bud, I’ll call you when it’s midnight over there.”
“Alright Kevin, have a great night. Happy birthday.”
I hung up and pulled myself forward to re-engage. We would have great nights in our different states, but it was still our night. And we understood that without saying anything.

Downtown Williamstown, MA has two streets: Spring, and Water. In the dead of winter in the Berkshires, it is crawling with shivering Williams College students seeking solace in the lone coffee shop. In the summer, it is actors clad sleekly in black and designers in paint-splattered jeans that stalk the two streets. If you’re lucky, you’ll see Leonardo DiCaprio getting ice cream or Bradley Cooper at the bar.
The Williamstown Theatre Festival, established in 1955, takes over the two streets and campus from June-August each summer. When I visited Williams College the summer after my junior year of high school, I found the posters proclaiming “WTF” particularly hilarious; my parents didn’t get it. Its ’62 Center for Theatre and Dance sits on Route 2, a monstrous shining building of glass and wood that boasts three theaters, multiple professional shops and seemingly unlimited rehearsal space. Williams counts Stephen Sondheim ’50 as an alumnus; “WTF” earned its Tony in 2002.
I came to the festival as one of 68 apprentices. The administrators called us “the lifeblood” of the festival in the opening and closing speeches of the season. We were college students and grads, roommates and all struggling actors. We’d been told Williamstown was where the New York theater scene summered. Painters and carpenters and stage managers and actors seeped from their schools across the country to the Berkshires to maniacally put on six main productions in 10 weeks for the public and countless others just for the festival. This was not a feat achieved in typical working hours—the festival operated 24 hours a day nonstop from mid June through August.
As an apprentice, we didn’t know our daily schedule until 9 p.m. the night before. Each night, we crowded the call board to see if we got to go sweep sawdust at the mill, have a Shakespeare class, or enjoy the rare coveted “Off” in which one would ideally do laundry but most likely sleep. When a show closed, another one loaded in the same night, calling for a “changeover” schedule in which apprentices would be called from 12-8 a.m. with seven hours to sleep afterwards. Theater magic definitely happened at “WTF,” but it wasn’t well-rested.
I’d often walk down Route 2 before my first shift of the day to watch the sun rise. The Berkshires hug Williamstown from every direction with mossy green and purple arms. I trudged through the mist to earn a latte, basically the only thing worth spending money on in town. There was a bar that burned a hole in most of the festival’s pocket, but I had to settle for the curse and blessing of being probably one of ten out of hundreds of people not yet 21. I would often see actors completing the same daily pilgrimage, sweaty from the exertion of maintaining their stage-worthy physiques. I knew their faces well after pointing a hot spotlight eight shows a week. Most didn’t know mine.
As hard as everyone worked, the festival made sure we had a good time. There were black tie galas at the nicer restaurant on Water Street, dorm ragers lit to perfection by lighting interns, and rarely a night passed without some theatrical event to attend. Inevitably, everyone ended up at the bar. There were always whisperings that this actor or that director, in town for the night to see a show, would be there to rub shoulders with. The whispers were usually wrong, but it was fun to fantasize. Parties aside, some of my best memories came from the occasional twenty-minute road trip to Walmart in someone’s dad’s car or a dip in the watering hole, avoiding the leeches, of course.
Time warped when crossing the blackened quad at 3:30 a.m. after finishing cooking middle-of-the-night breakfast for ravenous carpenters. We had no days off for the entire season, so the weeks overlapped with the months and mingled between the minutes and seconds. We were constantly exhausted, but only because we knew there were just ten precious weeks to see all the midnight shows, play improv games, and spend time with people who had, if anything, an intense respect for theater. If you were sleeping, someone else who wasn’t got the chance to perfect the last prop that might send the show to Broadway. There was a collective understanding that what we did was important.
I now have an impressive array of apparel declaring “WTF happened to me” and “WTF: Have you been?” Frankly, it would be a shame not to take advantage of such a versatile acronym. I collected these snarky souvenirs along with the newfound knowledge of how to change a wig in under three seconds, how to talk to someone who’s won three Tonys, how to always watch the midnight shows because no matter how tired you are after a full day of shifts, you’re seeing the product of three weeks of rehearsals that began and ended even later in the night.
Most people go to the mountains each summer to catch up on rest. If they go to the theater, it’s for some light entertainment. If you’re one of those people, Williamstown may not be what you expected. But you will leave finally knowing WTF is going on.

In October 1985, years before she enshrined  her self-ravaged tongue in a best-selling memoir on antidepressants,  Prozac Nation, Elizabeth L. Wurtzel ’89 was a freshman comping The  Harvard Crimson, as well as an all-too-young fan girl of The Velvet  Underground. With the recent passing of the VU’s frontman, Lou Reed, at  the age of 71, FM has decided to reprint the first article Wurtzel wrote  for the Crimson: an arts review of Lou’s 1985 solo compilation "City  Lights." It’s a rather strange and salient read, coming off well-nigh as  an obituary for the then (mostly) alive heroin-addict/ punk-poet.  "Let’s face it," Wurtzel wrote, "Lou Reed should be dead." To Wurtzel,  like the rest of us, Lou was a damn near perfect rock musician, lacking  only the privilege of perenniality that comes with posthumous listeners,  and with an end like Hendrix’s and Elvis’s and Morrison’s—unflinching  and with a bang. In stirring, memorializing language well beyond the  talent of most Harvard freshmen, Wurtzel attempted to correct for the  deficiency, eulogizing instead the things we remember most fondly of  Lou: his decade in the Velvets, his old alcoholic sound, its  melodeclamation and feral whip, that he rhymed "vial" with "vile," that  he was constantly pissed off at everyone except for "Sweet Jane." Most  of all, Wurtzel eulogizes what would become Lou’s forty year solo  career—one that would come to perfection on October 27, 2013. 


Sole Rock N Roll Survivor
Classic Performances by Lou Reed: City Lights Produced by Arista Records


October 12, 1985
In the summer of 1981, Jim Morrison  appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone. The caption read, "He’s hot,  he’s sexy, and he’s dead." And the editors of Rolling Stone are  tasteless. And astute. After all, they were onto something.
The hottest and sexiest creatures in youth  culture today now loom eternal in heaven, purgatory and (most likely)  the deadlier, diabolical realms down under. Think about it. What does  become a legend most—Natalie Wood in blackglama mink or Natalie Wood in a  shroud? And who would Harvard students most want to see gracing their  dorm walls—Mel Gibson brandishing a laser gun or James Dean brandishing a  cigarette? And what picture better represents mock-native cinematic  sexuality than Marilyn Monroe struggling with her out-of-control white  frock over a dark subway grid? Even Madonna’s hairy armpits can’t  compete.
But getting back to rock stars, we all know  that Jimi Hendrix is the greatest guitarist who ever lived (and died),  that Janis Joplin cornered the market on blues, and we dare not  challenge their legends. Weren’t we all taught not to speak badly of the  dead, since they’re not around to defend themselves? Instead, we let  their sacrosanct memories be grappled with and protected by biographers,  former lovers and marketing geniuses of all types. And the faces of the  long gone past gain the mystique of the unknown—what if they had lived  on?—and the privilege of never becoming old, decrepit, or friends of  Ronald Reagan.
Which brings us to Lou Reed, who in the age  of the legendary dead and dying has the misfortune of being alive and  kicking. A misfortune only because, in the tradition of felines and rock  stars, Lou Reed must have nine lives. Nine distinct incarnations  ranging from junkie to jogger, from wife-beating closet queen to  affectionate husband, from Velvet Underground frontman to the man on the  Honda scooter who won’t settle for just walking. And he’s had to watch  his various lives fold and unfold in the public eye to varying degrees  of interest. But worse than that, pardon the melodrama, probably hardly a  day goes by for Lou Reed that he doesn’t have to live with being a  survivor. A survivor in the rock and roll sense of the word.
While many rock stars who were once heroin  addicts have now kicked smack (with an exaggerated sense of  self-importance and fanfare) to delve into the pleasures of clean  living, none had previously told the story of the vicissitudes of  drug-crazed existence quite so blatantly or prolifically as Lou Reed.  None wrote a song called "Heroin." None has quit the music business so  abruptly, pleading lethal side effects and a litany of near-death  experiences.
LET’S FACE IT: Lou Reed should be dead.
Which adds mortal irony to his recent  return to the music industry with a big bam boom. Last year’s album, New  Sensations, captured a series of everyday experiences that Reed could  describe with virginal excitement because they weren’t drug-influenced.  It was, to say the least, an upbeat album even if it lacked anything  like a raw edge. And it gave us the first Lou Reed video, "I Love You,  Suzanne," a video which combined staccato sensuality with a  simple-minded song to terrific results. The album even included a  reworking of an old Reed tune, "Fly Into The Sun," about facing death  fearlessly.
Lou Reed, it seemed, was trying to face life fearlessly.
But even more interesting than Reed’s  resurfacing was the concomitant new interest in the Velvet Underground.  Considering the band’s last studio project, Loaded, was released in  1970, loving the Velvets is akin to loving the dead.
Which didn’t keep Velvets’ pal Gerard  Melanga and British writer Victor Bockris from penning Up-Tight, a  comprehensive Velvet Underground bio. The Polygram/Verve label  remastered the first Velvets album, The Velvet Underground and Nico, and  rereleased the second and third albums White Light/White Heat and The  Velvet Underground, long out of print.
The label also released VU, some unfinished  basement tapes, lost but not forgotten during the fragmented and  fractious end of the Velvets’ career. In fact, for the first time ever,  the Velvet Underground had a Hot Hundred album.
So besides having to live up to his own  position as a rock ‘n roll survivor, Reed is constantly forced to prove  that he was wise to leave, and consequently break up, the Velvet  Underground. And truthfully, he hasn’t done such a great job.
It’s no small feat to abandon successfully  what’s often been called the most innovative rock band ever, the  founding fathers of punk, the band that did heroin when everyone else  was doing acid. Critics can rave about the Velvets ad nauseam, and they  often do. When the critics have positive words for the new Lou, they’re  usually in light of his former greatness.
Lucky for Lou, he’s usually seen as the  elusive figure in the eyes of the Velvet vortex. He wrote the songs, he  set the tone, he was the first to wear pre-Ray Ban black shades. So the  newfound love for the Velvet Underground has spilled over to Lou Reed,  which naturally means that someone—namely the record companies—cashes in  on it.
WHICH EXPLAINS why Arista Records, with  whom Reed was affiliated from 1976-80, has just released Classic  Performances by Lou Reed: City Lights, an album attempting to chronicle  the most underrated and, honestly, least coruscating years of Reed’s  career. These were the years after RCA, Reed’s original and once-again  label, abandoned him as a relic, a shadow of his past triumphs. He  migrated to Arista and did a few years of soul-searching songstering  (and drying up) before returning to RCA and getting back on track.
The concept of the album is interesting.  You can’t do a greatest hits package without a single hit, and someone  was really exercising creativity in subtitling the album "classic  performances."
But try to listen to the album in its  proper context: remember that the late seventies’ most enduring  contribution to humanity was herpes. And as the liner notes convey, this  collection could be justified because it shows Reed coming of age,  discovering romance and reflection after years of cynicism. Here we have  the seminal influence on punk rock doing love songs and happy music  just as the Sex Pistols and the Clash were creeping into the public  consciousness.
The most interesting part of this album is  that it reminds us that Lou Reed is always going against the grain, and  is always more than a bit ahead.
Now, in the mid-eighties, Sid Vicious dead,  the Clash has broken up, and people are listening to treacly love songs  and talking about getting married (something Reed does quite a bit of  on 1980’s Growing Up In Public, whose selections are included in this  compilation).
The first side of the album is a 1978 live  performance from New York’s Bottom Line of three songs from Reed’s early  post-Velvets career. The soulful "Coney Island Baby" is even more  soulful live, "Berlin" is more bittersweetly melancholy and "Satellite  of Love" gains a full-bodied, joyous harmony and electricity that it  lacks on the more sedate studio recording. City Lights is worth the  purchase price for these three selections alone, since they’re  unavailable elsewhere.
The second side follows a lyrical theme of  romantic desire and longing for connection, but the music is pure  cut-loose rock ‘n roll. In fact, most of the sadness and restraint is  left behind on the first side. "Senselessly Cruel" is an easy  adumbration of the kind of danceable music that Reed has been producing  more recently. "City Lights," a reggae-funk tune written with Nils  Lofgren, is about looking for love ("Don’t those city lights bring us  together?/Together") instead of hate in the big city. And "Looking for  Love," a rough-and-tumble number, touches on the seamier side of that  pursuit.
The album hits its peak when Reed assays  the extremes of his emotional range. "Temporary Thing," with its  high-pitch backbeat and religious-chant vocals, delves into Reed’s usual  sphere of bad relationships, bad karma, and bad moods. It isn’t  pleasant, but it is pure and passionate, and it leaves us with Reed’s  optimistic message that even the worst of things is just a temporary  thing.
But marriage, in Reed’s mind, is not a  temporary thing, and he conveys this eloquently on the album’s closing  piece, "Think It Over." Taken from Growing Up In Public, an album noted  for being "mature," the song is a marriage proposal complete with an  ambiguous response about taking the time to think such a big move over.
As the song peters out, some contemplative  notes beckon certainly and an answer, which of course comes later, in  Reed’s post-nuptial recording career. Which is only the latest in the  trail of meteoric Lou Reed incarnations. And for those who like the new  Lou and the old Lou, but never took the time to investigate the middle,  this album provides an interesting look at the missing link.

Let’s face it: We students are notorious for not leaving the “Harvard bubble.” A 20-minute bus ride or equally time-consuming trek to Somerville’s Union Square may not seem worth the effort, but this destination is a hidden gem. During daylight hours, locals flock to its many cute cafés and weekly Saturday morning farmer’s market under the shadow of the well-known and yet seldom-visited Prospect Hill Monument. As the last rays of sun fade and afternoon turns to evening and night, Union Square offers a tremendous number of unique restaurants with cultural dishes you’ve likely never tried, as well as a hopping young professionals’ bar scene.
For the “locavores” out there
SHERMAN CAFÉ AND MARKET
One of the first businesses you see upon arriving in Union Square from Harvard, Sherman Café and Market offers only local food, with specific farm names and locations listed on each fruit, vegetable, or grain in sight. With a distinctly quaint and hipster-esque vibe, members of the friendly staff greet you at the door to recommend their favorite item that particular day. If the local and organic food, alternative music, and chill atmosphere aren’t enough to convince you to go, a trip to the bathroom yields a room filled with old and wildly amusing newspaper clippings plastered to the walls. You’ll spend so long reading them, the person next in line will think you’ve fallen in.
257 Washington St., Mon - Fri 7 a.m. - 7 p.m., Sat & Sun 8 a.m. - 7 p.m.
For a taste of Boston’s history
PROSPECT HILL MONUMENT
The name of Union Square itself is a result of its status as a recruitment and meeting site for the Union Army during the Civil War. Because of its height and location on the road from Charlestown, Prospect Hill was of great importance during the Revolutionary War as well. The monument, a tall stone building surrounded by a small park lush with breathtaking fall foliage, was erected in 1903 to commemorate the hill’s strategic significance. A climb up to the top yields a spectacular image of the Boston skyline, as well as a bird’s-eye view of couples getting married in the park or a man playing frisbee with his dog while practicing his Tae Kwon Do between tosses.
Prospect Hill Park
For true authenticity
MACHU PICCU
Many restaurants profess to serve authentic Peruvian cuisine simply because they serve raw fish in a lime sauce and call it ceviche. Machu Picchu, however, is the real thing. The owner greets you when you enter beneath the red and gold “Restaurante Turistico” sign, as Peruvian salsa music plays in the background. He’ll bring you to a table where a menu written in Spanish awaits (don’t worry, there are English translations). With soccer playing on the television and Lambayeque ceramic replicas in the corner, this is as close to a restaurant in Peru as you will get without actually traveling to the country. The food is both traditional and delicious—plus, Machu Picchu is the only place around Harvard where you can find pisco sours, the national cocktail of Peru.
307 Somerville Ave., Mon - Sun 9:30 a.m. - 10 p.m. (when kitchen closes, but stays open a bit later on weekends)
To tap into your German roots
BRONWNYN
A tiny tavern tucked away next to some of the more popular bars in the square, Bronwyn tends to remain unnoticed and overlooked. Once you step in the door, though, you’ll know you’ve discovered something great. The quiet and close atmosphere will make you feel right at home, as will the fact that “Downton Abbey” is playing in the corner on a television set that can’t be less than 30 years old. You’ll order off handmade menus written in German (again, with English translations), boasting a tremendously wide variety of German drinks and food. The ginger beer, alcoholic or not, is not to be missed.
255 Washington St., Sun - Wed 5 p.m. - 10 a.m., Thurs - Sat 5 p.m. - 10:30 a.m., Bar & Biergarten 5 p.m. - 12 a.m.
For nightlife in the square
BACKBAR
Possibly Union Square’s most well-known and well-attended bar, Backbar is a hub of young adult life not only on the weekends, but during weeknights and afternoons as well. True to its name, Backbar is difficult to find—upon reaching the nondescript address, look for a red door with a tiny plaque inscribed next to it, revealing you’ve found the correct location. After slinking through a dimly-lit concrete hallway bunker, you’ll be rewarded with a bright and plush assortment of cushion seating. A bourbon sour called the “Lion’s Tail” is prominently advertised as the most popular drink, along with daily and weekly specials scribbled on the chalkboard walls. Check out “Genius Hour” for after-school cheap snacks during the week. But make sure you get there early on weekend evenings, because the bar is small and doesn’t fill over-capacity, typically resulting in a line of at least ten people at the door.
9 Sanborn Ct., Wed - Mon 4 p.m. - 12 a.m.
Once you’ve experienced the highlights of both the day and nightlife in Union Square, be sure to check out the other popular restaurants and bars in the area. Once both Backbar and Bronwyn close at midnight, the Precinct and the Independent remain open for the later scene. Sally O’Brien’s is also worth a visit, offering live music most nights of the week and weekend. Hit up Journeyman, Union Square Pizza, India Palace, or Mama Gina’s for a tasty lunch or dinner—that is, if you’re not already stuffed from all the Square’s other offerings.

The tofu sizzles on a frying pan next to a pot of steaming miso soup. On the cutting board, kale leaves are being chopped up in preparation for a salad, and an electric mixer is forging its way through batter for vegan chocolate chip cookies. Amid the sizzling and chopping, students engage in a passionate discussion about the future of solar power.
It’s lunchtime at the Dudley Cooperative Society, Harvard’s alternative housing for undergraduates, a unique space structured on the idea communal living with an anti-establishment, leftist leaning. The residents refer to each other as family, and refer to the Co-op as home. But if you ask around campus, many students have never heard of the Co-op, or just know it as “some commune far away where all the hipsters live,” Co-op president Bex H. Kwan ’14 explains.
The Dudley Cooperative Society, founded in 1958, provides housing for 32 Harvard undergraduates and two resident tutors each year “who are not satisfied with the institutional nature of house life, but who do not want the isolation or the expense of living in an apartment,” its website says. Its members do their own cooking, cleaning, and food buying through a chore system. Co-opers live in two houses located in a residential area of Cambridge just about a 10 minute walk from the Yard.
Despite the inclusive nature of the community and the desire of some Co-opers to make the Co-op known to campus, the Co-op currently does not do much publicizing. Although their dinners are open to everybody, “people don’t really know that,” Kwan concedes.
The Co-op’s website has not been updated in years. Those who live there heard about the Co-op via word of mouth from friends or acquaintances in the know. Kwan explains that since the Co-op feels more like a home and less like an organization, the idea of publicity may feel a little uncomfortable. “I think that in some ways it’s a haven for a lot of people—it has become for me—so it’s sort of a secret that I don’t want to tell the whole world about.”
Part of this tension between exclusivity and inclusivity stems from the Co-op’s dedication to fostering a close community.
Yet many of the students living in the Co-op described the community there as a family. The atmosphere of the Co-op feels to them like a home in a way that Harvard Houses never did. Students were also compelled to join by other aspects of the house—its approach to food, its relationship to Harvard—that distinguish it from other living spaces on campus.
For some, cuisine was a major driving factor. Kwan explains that they struggled with eating at Annenberg during their freshman year. “For me, eating is a very personal experience and a very important part of my day, and so sharing it with people I don’t know and have strangers sit next to me and not talk to me was kind of jarring. It was important for me to know who cooked my food, and to be able to thank them.”
Devi K. Lockwood ’14 also characterizes eating at her House, Currier, as stressful. After cooking dinner with a friend during a visit, she realized “food and making food and being around food and having a smaller community of people who actually care how you’re doing is really important to me in terms of physical and mental health.”
Lauren M. Chaleff ’15 recalls the “spectator aspect” of living in a dorm or House, where people are constantly observing what you’re wearing. At her visits to the Co-op before she moved in, she explains, “I just felt so comfortable in my own skin, no matter what I was wearing.” Chaleff continues, “Here, I can walk around in my underwear if I want to and I know that no one’s going to think or say ‘slut.’”
Others referred to the institutionalized nature of the House system as the reason for their desire for an alternative. Although she really liked Kirkland House, Macarena M. Arias ’14 says there was an “overbearing, institutionalized feeling that [she] didn’t feel comfortable with.” At the Co-op, she finds that there is “less emphasis on school, school, school is your life. It’s more like: hey, we’re just living here and thinking about different things. I didn’t want to feel like I was surrounded by an institution 24/7.”
Arias explains how the Co-op fulfills different roles for its members. “For some people, this is a place where they have more liberty or leisure, where they can have a beer when they have dinner. Whereas [for] other people, this place is more like a homey place,” she says. “Other people see this place as a hub for radical thought.”
Even with these differences in the way the Co-opers experience the space and reasons for coming to the Co-op in the first place, there is a “common element to those reasons: just wanting a change,” Arias says.
Sometimes, the discrepancy in visions of the Co-op and how it should function has been the cause of conflict between Co-opers. Chaleff recalls how last year there were “two camps” within the Co-op with regards to the type of food that should be purchased and consumed.  There was a lot of tension, she explains, between those who wanted to spend money on only organic food and those who said that “just because the club has the reputation of being crunchy granola, we want to eat chips and that’s our decision: this is our house and we live here too.”
Chaleff also mentions how some people living in the Co-op want the house to be more autonomous and not have Harvard send maintenance, while others do not have the same desire. “Within the Co-op, people have a lot of different ideas about what they want,” Chaleff says. “We all deal with that and try to make this a compromise for everyone.”
The process of joining the Co-op community is very straightforward; it has no interview process or application, the Co-opers explain. “It’s really a self-selecting community,” Lockwood explains. After speaking with one of the tutors and joining the Co-op for a dinner, you are put on the waitlist immediately, and are then offered a spot once spots open up.
Though she appreciates that the Co-op is a “completely open community,”  Indiana T. Seresin ’15, an inactive Crimson editor, wishes that the Co-op had a “slightly more selective process so I felt like people were moving in for the right reasons and not for negative reasons like, ‘I don’t like my blockmates.’”
Many Co-opers would like to see the Co-op community expand, and would like more Harvard students to know what it’s all about. “I would love to see this opportunity open up to many people,” Kwan says. “I feel like if people really knew what we were about, and how close we are to campus, how great the food is, etc. people would actually be really into it.”
The Co-opers point to the fact that compared to other schools, Harvard’s Co-op community is very small. Stanford, for example, houses seven Co-ops. “It’s crazy that there’s only one here,” Lockwood says.

With the crisp November weather looming in the air, FM sat down this week with two eligible Harvard men prepared to take part in No Shave November. While the Fall tradition might merely appear to be an excuse for laziness, for these men it’s more—it’s about competition, pride, and manliness. Take your last look, ladies, because things are about to get hairy.
Taras B. Dreszer ’14
FM: Why No Shave November?
TBD: You have to, you know? It’s senior year, and it’s a college tradition. On the one hand it forces people who normally have beards to shave them [at the beginning of the month], and on the other hand, you aren’t judged for growing out your beard and being manly.
FM: Is there a competitive element?
TBD: There is a little bit of a manliness factor. We compete to see who can grow out his beard the fastest.
Matthew S. Ackerman ’14
FM: Why No Shave November?
MSA: In a year or two I’m going to be in the real world, and I feel like this is the last opportunity to have a little fun [with my appearance].
FM: How do you think the ladies will react to your new look?
MSA: To be determined. Different girls definitely have different reactions. I’ve had one ex that loved it and one ex that hated it. I’ll fill you in at the end of the month.
FM: How do you think it will affect your daily life?
MSA: I have a law school interview at the end of the month, so it’s going be a tough decision [whether to shave]. I think I’ll stick with No Shave November.

Last week’s Boston victory may have marked the end of baseball season, but the Sox, along with Harvard’s own baseball team, won’t stop working hard, or be forgotten by their many fans any time soon. This now-esteemed sport has not always garnered favorable reactions, however—particularly from former Harvard President Charles William Eliot.
Eliot found the curveball to be a particularly deplorable tactic, “Well, this year I’m told the team did well because one pitcher had a fine curveball. I understand that a curveball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive.” He added, “Surely this is not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard.”
Eliot was also a vocal critic of football and other sports. Were the university to have followed Eliot’s athletic as well as academic dictums, Harvard might still only offer rowing and tennis, the two athletic activities he deemed honorable. This photo depicts a Harvard baseball practice circa 1898, during Eliot’s tenure; its players, though clad (surprisingly) in turtlenecks, are sporting familiar baseball caps.

Antonio R. Villaraigosa sits in an armchair at the Institute of Politics, his hair slicked back. The former Mayor of Los Angeles  and 2012 Chairman of the Democratic National Convention, now a visiting fellow at Harvard's Institute of Politics, is ever the genial politician as he sits down with Fifteen Minutes.
1. FM: Other than this [fellowship], how have you been spending your time since your term as mayor ended?
Antonio R. Villaraigosa: Well I thought it was important that I share some of the lessons learned in eight years as mayor, six years in [the California] State Assembly, two years as Speaker of the [California State] Assembly and two years as a council member, so I signed on with the Harry Walker Agency. I think it’s also important, at a time when our economy is struggling to move ahead, to figure out how we create more jobs, and understand the needs of America’s businesses so I’m involved with Herbalife, [...] a health and nutrition company focused on empowering people to change their lifestyles [and] addressing the epidemic of obesity and diabetes.  [I've been] working with the Bank of California as a senior adviser […] around mortgage lending, affordable housing, and small business lending programs. I’m a senior adviser with Edelman International, the largest public affairs company in the world. [It’s a] company focused on trust and integrity as important, corporate values. [I’m a] senior fellow with the Bipartisan Policy Center and [I’m] about to announce an affiliation with a major university.
2. FM: So, in short, not much.
ARV: I’ve always been known for long days. I think I’ve had about 42 hours of sleep in the last 11 days. I’ve been been to France and Korea, New York multiple times, back in LA, New York and then Boston. I’ll be back in LA Monday […] continuing the pattern of long days I’ve established over the years.
3. FM: You're speaking on Latino leadership later this week. Who might you say is an act to follow in  the United States’ Latino community?ARV: One of your fellow graduates Henry Cisneros. Great leader. In many ways I patterned my role as mayor after his. He was a mayor for all the people […] I ran on and understood the role is first just to be a uniter […] and a coalition builder.
4. FM: The end of your final term as mayor was the tipping point for Prop 8, in terms of going through the courts. What was the lead up to that like for you?
ARV: I’ve supported marriage equality since 1994. During my speakership I authored the anti-discrimination bill in housing and employment that really protected LGBT students from […] discrimination they found in public schools. I was always someone who was focused on ... LGBT civil rights and played a leading role in the effort to defeat Prop 8. I was very supportive of the litigants in Prop 8 in that case. [I] actually married two of the litigants right after we won.      So, if you remember when I was chairman of the Democratic Party Convention, one of the first questions they asked was did I believe [gay rights] should be part of the platform and I said, ‘Absolutely.’ That didn’t go over so well with some, [but] I said to everyone, when you’re the face of the party, (and I was the face of the convention as the chair of the convention), I couldn’t do a capable job in that regard if I wasn’t authentic. Everybody knew since 1994 that I was for marriage equality, so why wouldn’t I support it being included in the platform? So this is an issue I’ve been involved with my entire public life.
5. FM: You served as a national chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Should the opportunity arise again, can you see yourself joining her, whether in that same capacity or in another one?
ARV: Absolutely, are you kidding? You know, I’ve worked on a lot of campaigns, but I was with her in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Texas. I was proud of her candidacy, her courage, her indefatigability, and I’m a big supporter of Hillary Clinton.
6. FM: So you mentioned you were the chairman of the 2012 Democratic National Convention. What exactly does that mean?
ARV: You’re the face of the convention, a spokesperson for the party and the platform. And a surrogate, one of the more active surrogates for the campaign.
7. FM: Was there anyone that you were particularly excited to have speak?
ARV: Always excited to hear President Obama, Bill Clinton. Those were two of the people that you’re always excited to hear and see.
8. FM: Is a gubernatorial campaign still something you're considering?
ARV: I’m not really focused on five years from now. I am focused on using this time to reflect, to share experiences and lessons, to develop a business acumen, to learn. [I'm focused on being] involved in issues of public policy, particularly around the idea of fixing this dysfunctional, broken, hyper-partisan [political] environment.
9. FM: Is there anything that you wish you could have gotten done as mayor, but weren’t able to for lack of support or lack of time?
ARV: I don’t think a whole lot about what we didn’t do. I put everything I had into my job as mayor, as a  councilmember, as assembly member, as Speaker of the Assembly. I gave it all I had and I don’t look back too much.
10. FM: What do you intend to focus on in the future?
ARV: The one area that I’ll continue to focus on is the issue of improving our public schools. It’s the most important issue of our time: preparing our kids for jobs of the 21st century and ensuring that the pathway to that opportunity in America, which has always been our public schools, remains a pathway without the kind of hurdles to overcome that you see today for so many kids who are poor or of color.
Sections
It’s 1 p.m., and students are streaming into Sanders Theatre, Harvard’s largest and most ornamented lecture hall. Computer Science 50 lecturer David J. Malan ’99 stands onstage, dressed, like many of his students, in a course-branded quarter-zipped hoodie. Dubstep blares from his laptop, his fingers zoom across the keyboard, and he takes one last sip of Sprite before striding to the center of the stage.
“Welcome back to CS50!” Malan calls out into his clip-on microphone. Video cameras across the room train their lenses on Malan, whose taped lecture will eventually be seen by nearly an eighth of the student body and thousands of edX students across the world.
Three hours earlier, English professor Philip J.  Fisher paces side to side at the front of his Sever lecture hall. “The Classic Phase of the Novel,” the English Department’s banner course, has yet to begin, and Fisher is scrawling something on the chalkboard, no computer or video cameras to be seen. Students are still wandering in when Fisher returns to his podium and begins to speak.
Tragedy is the topic of the day, but a different item tops Fisher’s agenda. He has not met enough students, he says, and so he will sit in on sections during the week to get to know them on a more personal level.
The differences between CS50 and “The Classic Phase of the Novel”—the size, the style, the aim—are emblematic of the national media debate about the decline of the humanities. While STEM —the trendy acronym for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—departments have hierarchical learning structures that place every student in the same massive introductory classes, the humanities are characterized by smaller classes, a less sequential course progression, and enhanced professor-student interaction.
CS50 has been the face of the Computer Science Department’s rise, which has paralleled a broad decline in the number of humanities concentrators at the University. (Fifty-seven percent of incoming freshmen who say they want to study the humanities end up choosing other fields.) Overall, the number of humanities concentrators at Harvard has fallen 4 percentage points in the last decade, while STEM-field concentrators grew in number by 10 percentage points. Rates of decline in humanities majors at peer institutions such as Yale and Princeton were similar, although national rates stayed stable.
However, these statistics are inconclusive at best. Depending on the timeframe you use, the national change in degrees in the humanities can either look like a decline or a renaissance. According to data published by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the number of humanities degrees today is higher than the mid 1980s but significantly lower than the peak in the 1960s. The reasons given for the recent decline at Harvard are unclear. While some argue the trend at Harvard is the result of an economic recession, others contend that the increase in science concentrators is largely due to erasure of stigmas attached to women in STEM disciplines.
The question at the heart of the debate has been whether the humanities are worth studying. But an examination of the humanities at Harvard suggests that the struggle has less to do with subject matter and much more to do with rethinking pedagogy, enhancing accessibility, and promoting innovative means of processing information.
WHAT HUMANITIES CRISIS?
If you had scanned the website of any major American news outlet this past summer, you would have likely come across some mention of the crisis in college-level humanities. According to New York Times opinion writer Stanley E. Fish, the humanities crisis is the fault of the elitist academy. The Atlantic suggests that the humanities crisis actually happened in 1985. A July news article in Inside Higher Ed, on the other hand, presents data that the humanities crisis is attributable to the movement of women into the sciences. There is no crisis in the humanities, Nate Silver argued.
Part of what sparked this most recent media maelstrom was a report that Harvard’s Arts and Humanities Division published in June, the culmination of an 18-month-long investigation into the status of the humanities at Harvard. The report reflected growing concerns that both the University and society were leaving the humanities behind and proposed potential solutions.
There are two prongs to the decline of Harvard student interest in the humanities: the falling number of students who plan to major in the humanities, and the ensuing decline of students who actually do.
According to the June report, the number of incoming freshmen intending to major in the humanities fell 9 percentage points at Harvard over the last decade. (Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal did not respond to requests for comment on the role the Admissions Office plays in the declining number of incoming students who want to pursue humanities.)
The students who still plan to study the humanities do so primarily out of intellectual curiosity, found a survey of incoming Harvard freshmen cited in the June report. But 57 percent of these humanities-inclined students end up in another field, almost all of them in a social science concentration.
One of these students who changed her mind is Lily R. Glimcher ’14, a psychology concentrator who intended to study history of art and architecture, English, or a special concentration in dramatic arts. She says that she switched because she found that psychology fit her personality.
“Everything I wanted to do as a person really fit into psychology,” Glimcher says. “I found that it’s this great intersection between the humanities and the sciences. And depending on the classes you take, you can really explore both of those two things.”
Ned L. Whitman ’15, a history and science concentrator with a secondary in visual and environmental studies, came to Harvard to study VES and neurobiology. However, he discovered the social sciences felt like a good fit.
“It was a choice that brought in my outlook on life in general and my education, but I didn’t see it as closing any doors either,” he says. “Because I knew if I wanted to go into the sciences, that option for graduate school would be available, or vice versa, if I wanted to go into the arts or business.”
But the anecdotes can only explain so much, and faculty are still confused as to why more than half of students interested in the humanities declare a concentration in the social sciences. One common hypothesis is that the changing socioeconomic climate of the College has resulted in more admitted students who are wary of the humanities.
“The demographics of Harvard have changed, so with this very exciting financial aid initiative, there are more students here who are traveling with expectations of their families and others,” says Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “They may be the people who are going to break from a cycle of modest income.”
However, citing the report published in June which he co-chaired, English professor W. James Simpson says financial pressures do not factor into students’ choices of concentration.
The debate over the financial viability of a humanities degree comes at a time of economic uncertainty, when Harvard students feel increasingly pressured to plan early for their lives after college. For a field that has always focused on degrees that are lucrative intellectually, rather than financially, the humanities now find that economic concerns have bled into substantive ones. Without providing financial security, students wonder, are the humanities worth it?
WEIGHING THE HUMANITIES
The question is hard to answer on a University-wide level, but anecdotally, many humanists maintain that their fields lead to a variety of career options.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen says her division’s alumni are often “venture capitalists with concentrations in the classics, or architects with concentrations in, say, music or English.” When it comes to future employers, Sorensen says, “They’re not looking for a person who’s going to know every little detail of their first job. They want a Harvard student.”
K. Lanier Walker ’14—an English concentrator with a history of art and architecture secondary who plans to be a museum curator—agrees. “Maybe I can’t build a car, but I can analyze things, I know how to make arguments, I know how to write,” she says. “I believe you can learn job skills on the job.”
Aurora C. Griffin ’14 succinctly sums up the effects of a humanities concentration on her job prospects: “I’m studying classics; I’m going to work for McKinsey next year.”
Another way to measure the worth of a humanities degree is to examine the undergraduate experience itself—and humanities concentrators are happy, surveys say. Humanities students report appreciation for the small size of their concentrations. The smallest Harvard concentrations consistently score the highest in senior satisfaction ratings, and for the class of 2012, humanities concentrations had the highest scores overall.
A seminar teaching style, with the close connection to professors it offers, is one of the humanities’ biggest draws. “When you’re taking a science class, unless you go to your TF’s office hours, you’re not going to interact directly with anyone from the teaching staff,” says Lea Corban ’14, a romance languages and literatures concentrator who initially planned to study engineering. “Whereas in the humanities, your professor emails you first.”
Concentrator satisfaction and anecdotal evidence of postgraduate career options, however, do not address the degree to which humanistic thinking matters in a world ruled by algorithms.
Slavic languages and literatures professor Julie A. Buckler laments, “There may be a general perception that the humanities matter less—that they’re decorative rather than fundamental.”
Roxanna Haghighat ’15, a premed neurobiology concentrator with a secondary in VES, remembers attending back-to-back film theory and global health sections last year. “I’d go from talking about the implications of architecture in one of these shots and how this was the most important thing, and then going to a discussion of how millions of people are dying,” she says.
Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker thinks the utility of the humanities is more nuanced.  While he admires aspects of the field, he has emerged as a vocal critic of the insular nature of humanities in contmporary academia. As he wrote in “Science is Not Your Enemy” in The New Republic this summer, Pinker believes the humanities would be both intellectually enhanced and practically benefited by incorporating scientific ideas. In an interview with The Crimson, Pinker added that in the humanities, “any attempt to say that the sciences are relevant or integrated or simply continuous is seen as a threat.”
Other scholars disagree that fields like cognitive science will greatly improve humanistic thought. “The neurosciences are nowhere near understanding consciousness. It’s like 11-year-old boys geeking out on their robots; it’s nothing more than that,” says Yale philosophy professor Jason Stanley, who co-wrote a New York Times opinion piece two weeks ago arguing that humanistic thinking directly enhances scientific pursuit of truth. “By doing fMRIs, by finding out that part of the brain turns green when you read Shakespeare, what do you learn about Shakespeare? Nothing.”
REPACKAGING COURSES
Such interdisciplinary barriers are only part of the structural problems for the humanities. Humanities departments lack the rigid structure of the natural or social sciences, and humanities concentrators note that they were immediately able to take high-level seminars as freshmen or sophomores. However, the fluidity of the departments has a negative flip side—prospective concentrators are often not sure where to begin.
In 2007, concerns about the accessibility of humanities material, especially to prospective freshman concentrators, prompted English professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, along with fellow English professor Louis Menand, to offer English 110: “A Humanities Colloquium,” a department-specific introduction to the “remarkable works of art in our literary tradition,” as Greenblatt describes it.
“When a student comes to Harvard and looks at the catalog, they look at LS1a and Ec10 and know that they can take those courses,” Menand says. “They don’t see anything in the humanities that they think they can take, and they might avoid taking classes in the humanities because they don’t see a class freshmen can expect to do well in.”
Menand says that English 110, which is currently capped at 36 students and offered every other year, was never intended to match the size of the large introductory science courses. It was designed to introduce students to the humanities and generate excitement about the discipline.
“We began by sitting around and just asking ourselves what it is that we thought that students should have read before they graduated,” Greenblatt says. “I don’t mean only students who are majoring in and studying humanities, but as part of virtually anyone’s education, what you should read.”
Previous attempts at introductory humanities classes, like English 110, have increased departmental accessibility, but there isn’t a clear analog in the humanities for sweeping introductory courses such as Ec10, CS50, or Stat104.
“What you can’t do is have [an] ‘Intro to Humanities’ [course] that covers all times, all cultures, men and women. It’s just not feasible. You’re going to have to make some choices,” philosophy professor Alison J. Simmons says.
Despite this, humanities faculty have attempted to tackle the accessibility problem by offering three new courses this academic year: “The Art of Looking,” “The Art of Listening,” and “The Art of Reading.”
Called “framework” courses and listed under the humanities heading in the course catalog, the three classes serve to “introduce students to humanistic thinking without indoctrinating them, if you will, in any particular disciplinary formation or set of assumptions,” says history of art and architecture professor Robin E. Kelsey, who co-teaches “The Art of Looking.”
Most weeks, students in “The Art of Looking” attend lecture, a looking session, and a lab session.  One week’s lab was called “Graph Court,” Kelsey says. It “entailed students receiving a set of facts, and [as] a part of an imaginary law firm, they come up with visual displays using graphs that would make a compelling case for their side in a fictional lawsuit.”
Kelsey thinks his course differs from other kinds of intro-level courses by making tangible connections to the world outside the University. For instance, Kelsey says, “I do think people across a great many fields have to deal with graphs, whether they’re in medicine or they’re in law or in one of the social sciences or the natural sciences—graphs are ubiquitous.”
Another potential solution to accessibility concerns in the classroom comes from an unusual source—the so-called digital humanities.
Romance languages and literatures professor Jeffrey T. Schnapp is one of the many faces of this new movement. The former Stanford professor is the founder of metaLAB (at) Harvard, a research group whose mission is, according to its website, to “[chart] innovative scenarios for the future of knowledge creation and dissemination.”
MetaLAB, Schnapp says, focuses on creating new frontiers of presenting information—creating a kind of inclusivity the humanities have not always had. One of the lab’s first projects, Curarium, was the creation of a digital “collection of collections” where students can explore museum art from the comfort of their dorm room.
Similar initial projects have focused on visualization tools for public library data, leveraging the unique library and museum collections of Harvard to create digital databases that allow students to use the tools of the future to connect with the keys of the past.
“Pretty much everything we do has a strong connection to teaching,” Schnapp says. “Teaching not just connected to a class but the idea of learning through making and doing—what is called a student-centered learning model—is really central to the lab.”
As Schnapp points out, the humanities have long been as much about the sharing and critique of ideas as they have been about the texts and art that prompt the discussion. MetaLAB is a reflection of the digital humanities movement: an attempt to combine the traditional tools of computer scientists with the motivations of the humanities, to make information universally accessible without sacrificing the personal nature of the subject.
A LASTING AND TANGIBLE IMPACT
When Alice A. Kenney ’14 was deciding whether to study comparative literature, though, accessibility wasn’t her primary obstacle.
“I was afraid I was being selfish,” Kenney says. “I was afraid that instead of learning about all the horrible problems caused by all the thousands of issues going on in the world, I was just studying beauty.”
Kenney thinks that many Harvard students feel burdened by the need to use their education to make a difference in the world.  Students worry, she says, “if they don’t study specific diseases going on, or specific issues, that they’re just learning for themselves and not anybody else.”
Kenney began her college career hoping to study social studies or anthropology, to learn about big-picture issues like race relations and inequality and, after college, to enact social change on the ground. As Kenney took more literature courses, however, she realized that the most helpful skill set for her future plans came from reading novels, not social theory.
“There was an article in the Science Times about how reading literature makes you more empathetic and in my experience, that’s really true,” Kenney says. “In some ways literature, and I’m sure other humanities, are about understanding other people’s minds and how other people think and how other people see the world.”
“In social sciences, we learn a lot about the big picture issues—about this percentage of people who have HIV or this percentage of people who are homeless,” Kenney continues. However, “it’s really important to remember the individual and the experience of that homeless person,” she says. “That kind of perspective, of empathizing with that individual, is a tool we learn in many places, but one of the places we learn that is in literature and in the experience of reading.”
Kenney’s opinion is shared by many who consider themselves proponents of the humanities. As Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies for History Heidi J.S. Tworek argues, the humanities are much more about teaching skills for life than focusing on the immediate future.
“Humanities are not about training you for the first job out of college, they’re about training you to gain the kind of skills that you use for the rest of your life,” Tworek says. “To be able to understand change, to be able to be empathetic—[those are] some things that are incredibly important in today’s globalized, networked world, where we continue to be confronted with very different cultures and very different ways of thinking.”
Simmons, the philosophy professor, has a response for students who deride the humanities for their lack of tangible impact: “Come back and talk to me when you’re 40,” she says. “I know so many people who have gone into law or business or finance, and they wake up in their 40s and they think, ‘What’s my life about?’”
The ability to understand these larger life questions is a key societal issue, says Sorensen, the Dean of Arts and Humanities.
Buckler, the Slavic languages and literatures professor, says it is “shocking” that the humanities should have to dignify their importance on a national stage. Yet she agrees with Sorensen, who says that the perception of crisis is an opportunity to remind the world of the importance of the humanities.
“Like the world out there, the humanistic and artistic life need to be once again put on the front burner,” Sorensen says. “Honestly, a lot of the problems we see in many spheres of contemporary life come from a loss of that perspective, which has to do with values, with meaning, with understanding and how you reach understanding, and also with how you debate differences of opinion.”
“As we’ve seen in our recent government misadventures, we don’t seem to have the tools for debate,” she adds.
Stanley, the Yale philosophy professor, concurs with Sorensen, suggesting that perhaps it isn’t such a big deal that the value of the humanities is being publicly debated. “The humanities are supposed to be in crisis,” he says. For a discipline with a lasting legacy—and which, he says, will not be replaced for thousands of years at least—discussion about the future is extremely valuable.
Stanley argues that no matter what accessibility and structural issues the humanities may have, they are a resilient and integral part of society.
On the whole, Harvard humanities professors agree with Stanley. But for now, they believe that their task is to bring the humanities to all Harvard undergraduates’ lives and to recruit more students with a passion for humanistic thinking.
“My lens for interpreting things that happen in my life, or things that happens in the news, or things that other friends experience, really is literature. I think through characters and things I’ve seen in art and things I’ve encountered in poetry,” Kenney says. “It felt appropriate in college to study my way of experiencing the world.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Nov. 13, 2013
An earlier version of this article stated that over the past decade, the number of incoming Harvard freshmen intending to major in the humanities fell by 9 percent, the number of Harvard humanities concentrators fell by 4 percent, and the number of STEM-field concentrators increased by 10 percent. To clarify, all of these figures refer to change in percentage points, not percentage rate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those who consume low amounts of fiber in their diets have a higher risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular inflammation, according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Medicine.
The study examined the dietary fiber intake of more than 23,000 people from a diverse group of white, African American, and Mexican American men and women.
According to the study, Mexican Americans consumed more fiber than non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic blacks.
The findings also showed that dietary fiber intake of U.S. adults has been persistently low over the past 10 years, and much lower than adequate fiber intake levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine, said Cheryl R. Clark, one of the lead researchers and a professor at Harvard Medical School.
Although the study did not look at college students specifically, the research indicates that those who graduated from college had the highest dietary fiber intakes.
Clark said that those who graduated from college were less likely to be obese, have the metabolic syndrome, and have increased levels of inflammation.
“Whatever college students decide to do, graduating seems to be associated with the most healthy outcomes in the general population,” Clark said.
The study focused on associations between dietary fiber intake and the risk of cardiometabolic risks, not the causal effect of eating fiber, according to Clark.
She said more randomized controlled trial studies are necessary to refine recommendations on the sources of dietary fiber. Although the study does not advise on the best sources of fiber, Clark said, “Data from other studies suggest that oats, cereals, and bean or legume sources are associated with reduced coronary heart disease risks.”
Clark pointed to two important policy implications from the study. The first is policies that ensure “regular monitoring and surveillance of these intake trends.”
The second is policies that invest in randomized data in order to“tease out what kinds of fiber and dietary sources are related metabolic syndrome,” Clark said.

Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have employed a new material to mimic the low-power, high-performance functioning of the human brain in simple circuits.
By exploiting the properties of correlated oxides—a family of materials that can fluidly change their electronic properties—professor Shriram Ramanathan and coworkers have made a device that can adapt in a way similar to brain cells.
“If an acquaintance comes towards you, you can recognize him or her in less than a second, as the time range for a neuron to work lies in [the range of] milliseconds,” said Jian Shi, a postdoctoral researcher in Ramanathan’s lab.
She said that this type of speed and low energy inspired material scientists.
The brain not only splits computation between many units, but also incrementally strengthens pathways after repeated use.
This is believed to be necessary for learning and memory.
But rather than just turning on or off certain neural connections, the brain increases the ability for a connection to carry an electric signal the more it is used.
This property is mimicked by incorporating correlated oxides into circuit connections.
Ramanathan’s group used samarium nickelate, which incrementally adjusts how well it conducts electricity according to how strong an electric field the circuit machinery applies to it.
As in the brain, these subtle shifts in conductivity are made with low energies.
“One of the key limiters for the functionality of mobile devices is the energy consumption,” Ramanthan said. “You’re basically limited to the power of your battery, so if you want a state-of-the-art computer running on your iPhone, that can be very challenging.”
This variable conductance behavior is at the core of the semiconductor industry, but still now, the industry suffers from the fact that highly structured silicon, which has classically been the best option for semiconducting devices, is quite expensive to produce.
Because the nickelate functions despite high disorder, it could eventually be cheaper to produce than current silicon products.
Plus it would not suffer from memory loss when unplugged from a power source.Ramanathan added that his group is currently attempting to incorporate this component into simple circuits, potentially to elucidate details of how brains affect behavior and perform tasks, such as pattern recognition.

Levels of key hormones can help better predict a woman’s risk for breast cancer, according to a study at Harvard Medical School presented at a conference hosted by the American Association for Cancer Research at the end of October.
The research team, led by Harvard Medical School professor Shelley S. Tworoger, found that higher blood concentrations of certain hormones led to a greater chance of developing breast cancer. The findings indicate that a simple blood test could prove useful for predicting whether women will develop the disease.
Tworoger said that it is important to identify women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer as early as possible so that doctors can intervene with chemoprevention or even more intensive screening.
For the study, Tworoger and her colleagues analyzed the hormone levels of 473 postmenopausal women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, as well as 770 women without the disease, none of whom were using postmenopausal hormones at the time of blood draw.
Tworoger said the study found there were three specific hormones—estrone sulfate, testosterone, and prolactin—that increased the accuracy of current models that predict the risk of breast cancer.
Most methods of assessing breast cancer risk rely solely on factors that can be investigated through a questionnaire, which as questions such as how many children a woman has, at what age she had her first child, whether she has family history of breast cancer, and what her personal history with breast disease.
However, Tworoger and her colleagues’ approach is unique in that it also takes into account hormone levels.
Though Tworoger said that while improvements in breast cancer prediction will help women make more informed decisions about health care, further research is still needed.
“It is important for future studies to confirm that the hormones that we selected as the best subset replicates in other populations,” Tworoger said.
Tworoger said that other factors such as genetic risk and mammographic density should also be examined and added to risk prediction models.
These two factors are not correlated with hormone levels and therefore offer potentially significant improvements, she said.  “The next step for research is adding all hormones, genetics, and mammographic density together to look at improvement in risk prediction,” Tworoger said.

Ten distinguished professors gathered in Emerson Hall on Wednesday as part of the Mahindra Humanities Center event “Prison USA: The Dilemmas of Mass Incarceration.” The event,  which was composed of two panels, dealt with the origins and current state of the American penal system and with the potential for change and solutions.
All four of the speakers on the first panel, moderated by Harvard Law School Professor Carol S. Steiker, brought up the issue of race. Paul Butler, a professor at  Georgetown University Law School, pointed to the ubiquitousness of arrests, criminal convictions, and imprisonment of African-American men, citing the 7:1 ratio of black men to white men in American prisons.
He listed the criminalization of drugs, the higher rate of violent crimes among African-Americans, and continuing socioeconomic inequities as contributing factors to the problem. Other panelists considered the role of race in driving trends in mass incarceration, focusing on the way in which the justice system treats minority groups.
“The new penalology is neither about punishing nor rehabilitating individuals; it’s about identifying and managing unruly groups” said Caleb Smith, professor of English at Yale University. Smith referenced the Jimmy Santiago Baca poem “How We Carry Ourselves” to describe how prisons “have become like warehouses.”
Bernard E. Harcourt, professor at University of Chicago Law School, linked capitalism to increased tolerance for mass incarceration in America, pointing to a correlation between decreased investment in welfare projects such as public housing with increased investment in prisons.
“The mass incarceration issue is unique in its magnitude and dehumanizing effects,” Harcourt said. “Yet it is just another episode of mass injustice in this country.”
After a short question and answer period, a different group of professors, moderated by African and African-American Studies professor Lawrence D. Bobo, discussed the future of mass incarceration in America. David D. Cole, professor at Georgetown Law Center, expressed some optimism about moving away from mass incarceration in the future. He cited the fact that the incarceration rate in the US has plateaued in recent years, as well as the changing political environment regarding mass incarceration. Democrats and Republicans alike have increasingly pointed out the need to reduce incarceration, Cole said.
“I think we also may have reached a tipping point in what Americans can tolerate,” said Cole. “2.4 million [incarcerated] is a pretty high number. We are the world’s leader. That’s not something anyone is proud of.”
Linda R. Meyer, professor at Quinnipiac School of Law, suggested that public perception of offenders as “monsters” has led to prison policies that do not deal with offenders as human beings. She emphasized the need to develop a “language of empathy” towards offenders by framing them as mothers, fathers, and family members. Bruce Western, a Harvard professor of sociology, pointed to the divisions poverty creates in society as one of the factors behind mass incarceration, and challenged the audience to be a part of the change.
“It’s our civil obligation to know and understand the most severe poverty,” Western said. “Only when we understand how life is lived on the margins can we begin to see something of ourselves in the other.

Scientists at the Harvard Medical School may have made a significant step forward in treating HIV.
In a comprehensive study led by HMS professor Dan H. Barouch ’93, scientists were able to use specific antibodies taken from human HIV victims to suppress viral activity in monkeys infected with simian-human immunodeficiency virus. The study was published in the scientific journal Nature on Oct. 30.
The success of Barouch’s study—which was largely funded by the Ragon Institute, a philanthropic institution that promotes HIV research at Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard—surpassed the expected result.
“After a single infusion of antibodies, we saw virus levels plummet to undetectable levels in a majority of cases, typically within seven days,” Barouch said. “The virus then rebounded in most animals in a period of one to three months, and that corresponded to when antibodies had a decline in the animal.”
According to Barouch, the most significant discovery was that, for a small portion of the monkeys, the suppression of viral levels was permanent.
“Perhaps most remarkably, in a subset of animals that started off with lowest levels of virus in the bloodstream, those animals had the virus go to undetectable levels, and those actually did not rebound at all,” Barouch said.
Barouch’s discovery differs from the standard approach to combatting HIV through antiretroviral drugs.
“Current antiretroviral therapy is extraordinarily potent and lifesaving,” Barouch said. “But also it has major limitations.”
Barouch, who conducts his research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, added that antiretroviral therapy is limited because its mechanism of action only includes actively targeting the replicating virus inside cells. Antibodies, on the other hand, have a different mechanism of action; they can directly target and eliminate free virus, as well as virally infected cells.
Barouch said that his next step will be to apply the results to humans in hopes of curing HIV.
“The caveat is that the study only involved animals, and so those observations will have to be reproduced in humans,” Barouch said.

Kepler 78b is a fiery planet with an orbit so much smaller than average that it may alter existing planetary theory.
A team of scientists, including Harvard Lecturer in Astronomy David W. Latham, discovered Kepler 78b, a planet outside of our solar system that is a “virtual twin of Earth by astronomical standards,” wrote unaffiliated University of Maryland Astronomy professor L. Drake Deming in a commentary to the science journal Nature.
Kepler 78b’s density of 0.2 pounds per cubic inch is equivalent to the density of the Earth, which suggests that the 3,500 to 5,000 degree Fahrenheit planet and Earth have similar iron and rock compositions.
Dimitar D. Sasselov, a Harvard professor of astronomy who worked on the project, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the research indicates that “planets made of rock and metals are common in the range [of] Earth's size.”
Sasselov said that the discovery opens many doors to new astronomical theory.
“We want to know how common Earth analogs are in order to evaluate habitability and origins of life,” he said.
Deming echoed Sasselov’s point, arguing that the discovery of Kepler 78b “foreshadows leaps forward in the search for life beyond the Solar System.”
But Kepler 78b is also significant for its differences from Earth—and from all other known planets.
“What is unusual about Kepler-78b is its orbit—it will require changes to the existing ideas [and] theories on planet formation,” Sasselov said.
Kepler-78b’s orbit is less than one million miles and takes 8.5 hours to complete.
The short orbiting period has left many astronomers baffled as to how the planet formed or arrived at its current location, said Sasselov.
NASA’s Kepler spacecraft has identified over 150 other planets, including a new class of planets with star orbit periods of under 12 hours, a category under which Kepler 78b falls. With data from the HARPS-N instrument on the Galileo National Telescope of Italy, the mass and density of Kepler 78b was calculated, making it the first of these new planets with a calculated mass.
“Our imagination and scientific prediction power was limited with only one solar system as an example,” said Sasselov.

For the first time in recent history, the most conservative Democrat in Congress is more liberal than the most liberal Republican, said Harvard Kennedy School professor Thomas E. Patterson Wednesday evening.
During a panel discussion titled “Too Many Checks, No Balance: Partisan Brinkmanship or a Shrinking Presidency?,” Patterson and David King, a lecturer at the Kennedy School, discussed the roots of the current political gridlock and its impact on American society.
Both King and Peterson said they thought the cause of such an ideological divide stems not from the members of Congress themselves or gerrymandering, but from the political impact of the average citizen. The average American’s exposure to the media and the various ways in which citizens are involved in politics at the local and national levels have accentuated recent increases in party polarization, said King.
“We are so overwhelmed by the available media that we listen only to what we want to hear and not things that make us uncomfortable. So we are not hearing the other argument,” King told the crowd gathered in Malkin Penthouse Wednesday.
Patterson added that data shows that the United States is relocating partisanship around geography, using Massachusetts as an example.
“States are increasingly becoming one-party states instead of two-party states,” Patterson said, pointing to the Mass. state senate, where four of forty seats are occupied by Republicans. “[Even if] you gave the map to the Republicans, they would have a really hard time redrawing the districts to double the amount of seats [in Mass.] they hold.”
Event attendee Edgar E. Mora Altamirano, a Kennedy School fellow and mayor of Curridabat, Costa Rica, said he thinks it is increasingly important to learn about the other side’s perspective on an issue and not simply accept the analyses that conform to one’s own ideologies.
“It’s important to remember that you have to be engaged without the prejudice that brings you to the same [sources for news] all the time. And that is tough, especially for young people, because social media is promising you a trip around the world, but what social media is doing...is giving you a trip around your corner,” he said after the event.
The consequences of political gridlock cannot be overlooked, Archon Fung, the discussion’s moderator and HKS professor, said after the panel.
“The reason [awareness of party gridlock] is so important to the greater community is because [gridlock] is preventing the American government, especially at the federal level, from getting business done, and has already had quite destructive effects both in terms of domestic policy, but then also in foreign policy implications,” Fung said.
Wednesday’s event is the sixth in the Challenges to Democracy series, sponsored by the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation.

Though it is possible to recognize and accommodate some physical disabilities, according to a college-wide panel that met Wednesday night at Gutman Library, there is still much work to be done in understanding and treating mental disabilities.
At the event, sponsored by the Harvard College Disability Alliance, International Higher Education and Disability, and Student Mental Health Liaisons, student and professor panelists alike discussed depression as a disability, the stigma that surrounds it, and how students can move forward when suffering from depression.
According to Lawrence I. Reed, a Harvard College Research Fellow in Psychology, a large part of the problem in attempting to understand depression is the disease’s extreme complexity. Even though scientists have made great strides in researching depression, it “still remains very esoteric and misunderstood by many individuals,” Reed said.
Christine E. Looser, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Business School, further explained the elusiveness of depression.
“We can’t see anyone’s mind, so we have to sort of make it up,” Looser said.
Despite the inability to fully understand what happens in each other’s minds, Reed emphasized the observable impacts that depression can have.
“Depression...is almost the worst possible thing you can have for many college students,” Reed said. “There is decreased motivation, decreased concentration, sleep disturbances, and eating disturbances.”
All of the panelists noted that it is important for the public to be careful not to make assumptions about the mental conditions of those who may be depressed.
“Depression from the outside might look like laziness or lack of motivation, or anything other than what depression really is,” Reed said.
The panelists also addressed the options available specifically for students suffering from depression.
“It is up to you to inform people of your circumstances,” said panelist Sam R. Peinado ’15, a student mental health liaison for the College. “It is o.k. to ask for slack and it is often granted, but you have to be open and honest.”
For those with friends dealing with depression, Looser offered that “asking your friend how he is doing and actually meaning it” is a simple and intuitive way to offer assistance. In addition, Looser said that the best way for individuals to open up and be able to talk about problems they may be facing is to encourage “authentic conversation about how people are actually feeling.”
Over the past year, the students and administrators have made concentrated efforts to address mental health on campus. These efforts  included a video campaign sponsored by the Student Mental Health Liasons called “Harvard Speaks Up,” at least one student rally, and open conversations between students and administrators about mental health.

In a finding that could advance malaria control, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Perugia, in Italy, have identified a way to block a reproductive interaction in malaria-transmitting mosquitoes.
The researchers’ study, published online on Oct. 29 in the open-access journal PLOS Biology, identifies the gene in the mosquito species Anopheles gambiae—the species most responsible for the spread of malaria—that regulates the number of offspring produced by the female.
The researchers found that when these mosquitoes mate, that gene in the female is activated by a steroid hormone from the male. By blocking this switch, the researchers concluded, they can control egg development and reproduction in the species, thereby reducing the number of mosquitoes transmitting the disease.
Adam South, a School of Public Health postdoctoral fellow and co-author of the study, said his team’s results were surprising because it is “kind of unusual for a female’s offspring to be so intimately tied to something coming from a male.”
South said that controlling transmission of the disease is “the most effective means of controlling malaria.”
School of Public Health professor Flaminia Catteruccia, another co-author of the study, named two ways in which the team’s results could help combat the spread of malaria.
One option, she said, could be to manipulate males so that they will not produce and transfer a functional hormone. A second possibility would be to design inhibitors of the gene to prevent females from developing eggs. These inhibitors could be incorporated into insecticide so that mosquitoes not killed by insecticide would, at the very least, not produce offspring.
“This would increase the lifespan and efficacy of insecticides, our best weapon against malaria and mosquitoes,” Catteruccia said.
Catteruccia and South both said they hope Harvard students recognize the importance of the scientific research going on around them. “I think it will be inspiring for students to realize that basic biology research carried out at Harvard can in the long run make a difference for global health,” Catteruccia said.
 Malaria results when infected mosquitoes bite humans, transmitting a parasite that infects human red blood cells. According to the World Health Organization, there were an estimated 219 million malaria cases and 660,000 resultant deaths worldwide in 2010. Ninety percent of all deaths occurred in the African region that year.

Physics professors Andrew E. Strominger ’77 and Cumrun Vafa were awarded the Milner Foundation’s Fundamental Physics Prize earlier this week. This $300,000 prize recognizes their achievements in theoretical physics and makes them eligible for a $3 million prize, whose winners will be announced on Dec. 12, according to Foundation representative Rob Meyer.
Strominger, director of the Harvard Center for the Fundamental Laws of Nature, and Vafa were honored both for their joint publications and for their collective body of work concerning a number of challenging problems that affect our view of the universe.
“One big question is: ‘What’s a black hole?’ The problem is baffling and it’s a tension between general relativity and quantum mechanics,” said Strominger.
While they have not found the solution to this problem, Strominger asserted that they have made significant progress by using the framework of string theory. In so doing, Strominger and Vafa managed to solve a puzzle that Stephen Hawking, one of last year’s winners and a member of the prize selection committee, had posed back in the 1970s. While Hawking had made predictions, Strominger and Vafa’s work now verifies and confirms string theory as a viable explanation for some of the workings of our universe.
Princeton University physics professor Nima Arkani-Hamed, a member of the selection committee and a former Harvard faculty member, explained that this breakthrough is “a huge boost in the field… and a milestone in understanding quantum gravity.”
“I’m happy to get it,” said Strominger, who then emphasized that his work was part of a team effort.
“There is a mythology, especially in theoretical physics, that advances are largely made by a few brilliant people, and that everyone else just cleaned up the details, but it’s the opposite. It’s progress that the whole community makes together and collaborates on.”
Vafa echoed this sentiment, and explained the important role that prizes play.
“We certainly don’t do science to get approval, but it’s a great feeling to see eminent colleagues appreciate our work. It’s tremendously satisfying,” he said. “Scientists don’t work for awards, but awards allow for contact with society. If society sees [science] as exciting and useful work, more people will want to join us.”
 To forge that connection, all winners give public talks on their research that will be collected into a resource for anyone interested in developments in the study of fundamental physics.

Panelists argued that the targeting of specific minority groups has infused the American criminal justice system with racial and socioeconomic bias at an event Thursday night.
“You can’t think of incarceration in the United States without thinking of racial disparity,” said Jessica T. Simes, a doctoral fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.
The event, entitled "Criminal (In)justice System," took place at Boylston Hall’s Ticknor Lounge and featured Simes, Boston Workers Alliance Director Phillip Reason, Kennedy School research assistant Catherine M. Sirois ’10, and Diana Li ’14, who tutors prisoners.
“Even after controlling for crime, neighborhoods with high minority populations have a much higher incarceration rate. This isn’t something we’re just seeing in Boston; we’re seeing this all over the state,” said Simes. “Race is an integral part of incarceration in the United States.”
During the discussion, the panel highlighted startling facts about the American penal system. Prisoners in the United States account for 25 percent of the world’s total prison population while U.S. citizens only account for five percent of the world’s total population. One in three black men between the ages of 18-30 are in prison, on probation, or on parole, and 70 percent of all people who enter the prison system will be incarcerated again.
“Black men are being arrested and sentenced at alarming rates,” said Reason.
The panel continued to discuss how a privatized prison system has created a conflict of interest between profits and personal rights. Legislation focuses more on satisfying those who are building prisons than those who are investing in them, Reason said. Lawmakers are more concerned with how to fill prison cells than how to keep people out of them.
“Through our policies we created ghettos. We chose mass incarceration as a response to social instability; we didn’t have to. We could have focused on building up education or building up families. We just didn’t,” said Sirois.
Reason also mentioned that the BWA has submitted a request that money that was allocated for prison expansion be redirected towards job development.
“Jobs not jails,” said Reason. “It costs an average of $40,000 for the government to incarcerate someone. That’s enough to send them to college; maybe even Harvard.”

Professors, students, family, and friends came together on Thursday to remember the life of former Harvard English professor, Harvard poet-in-residence, and Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Seamus Heaney.
“I thought [the service] was wonderful,” said English professor emeritus Joseph C. Harris, who also contributed to Heaney’s best-selling translation of “Beowulf.” “The poems selected were a marvelous selection of Seamus’s huge corpus.”
The service, held at Memorial Church, commemorated the Irish poet, who died Aug. 30, 2013. The program featured students and colleagues of Heaney reciting his poetry, including “Alphabets,” “The Master,” and excerpts from his translation of “Beowulf,” musical performances, and reflections on Heaney’s life and time at Harvard.
“He was extraordinarily insightful and generous,” said English professor and long-time colleague and friend, Helen H. Vendler. “Everyone who met him found it memorable to meet him.”
For K.E. Duffin ’76, studying with Heaney was a “life-changing experience,” and one that shaped her eventual decision to become a poet.
“Heaney was a tremendous mentor and friend to me,” Duffin said. “As a teacher, he was encouraging but also had the highest standards for his students.”
Heaney became a professor at Harvard in 1981 and was associated with the university, filling positions from professor to poet-in-residence, for 25 years. Many have praised Heaney for his contributions to Harvard and to the field of English.
“He made Old English poetry very well known,” Harris said. “He increased the profile of poetry in general, really.”
In addition to teaching at Harvard, Heaney had a room at Adams House and resided there for one semester each year. Robert J. Kiely, master of Adams House from 1973-1999, spoke during the service about Heaney’s contribution to the house community. When Heaney won his Nobel Prize in Literature in 1995 while abroad in Greece, Kiely broke the news to Adams House students, saying the crowd “cheered so loudly [Heaney] could hear it in Athens.”
“He immediately had a sense of the students,” Vendler said. “He had such a wonderful presence for such a long time with so many generations of students.”
Heaney’s poetry often focused on, and was inspired by, his homeland of Northern Ireland. Heaney also composed prose pieces and translated—for example, his modern translation of the epic “Beowulf” was widely praised.
Teresa Iverson, a writer who attended the event, said that Heaney’s presence on campus “really drew people to Harvard, who were not directly affiliated, but would come to listen in on Heaney.”
Many said they will remember Heaney for not only his poetry, but also his unique personality.
“He was a genius who also happened to be a wonderful human being, which is an extremely rare combination,” said Duffin.

Now that the referendum proposed by the Environmental Action Committee to eradicate single-use plastic water bottles on campus is slated to appear on the UC ballot in late November, the EAC is focusing on garnering student support for the referendum as well as for the installation of water fountains and refill stations in all residential and academic buildings.
The EAC’s campaign, called “Beyond the Bottle,” seeks to educate students about the safety of drinking tap water from fountains and refill stations. If the referendum is passed, these stations will replace the sale and distribution of plastic water bottles across campus in places like Harvard cafes and dining halls.
“We have some of the cleanest drinking water in the U.S., here in Cambridge,” said former EAC chair Kristen J. Wraith ’14. “A lot of people think that [tap water] isn’t really something that you should be drinking, but we want to make people feel as safe and comfortable as possible drinking this water.”
According to an EAC email statement, the process of bottling water uses 17 million barrels of oil and produces more than 2.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. This, in turn, furthers the proliferation of greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere.
EAC members said that they did not think replacing bottled water on campus would be a major inconvenience for students.
Alex G. Krolewski ’15, a member of the EAC who ran a blind taste test between bottled and tap water during the early phases of the EAC’s campaign, said that “people could not really tell the difference.”
The EAC obtained 687 signatures on their campaign’s petition, surpassing the 10 percent of the student body necessary for their referendum to appear on the UC ballot. According to Wraith, the campaign received overwhelming support from the students it reached.
Jordan T. Weiers ’16, who signed the petition and plans to vote to pass the referendum, said that he believes the transition from plastic bottles to fountains and filling stations might be uncomfortable for the unaccustomed. Still, he said that he feels it is a step the administration needs to take in order to promote sustainability on campus.
“It will encourage Harvard students to buy their own bottles and use them,” he said.
Will B. Geiken ’15, a student who was not aware of the petition prior to his interview with The Crimson, said he will vote to pass the referendum.
“I believe that the excess plastic waste created from non-reusable plastic water bottles isn't beneficial for the environment as a whole,” he said.

A panel of healthcare experts discussed strategy for investing in healthcare companies as part of the Harvard Business School Healthcare Alumni Association’s 14th Annual Alumni Healthcare Conference at the Charles Hotel on Thursday.
The panel, entitled “Investing Top 10: Hot or Not?,” included live polling of the audience. Throughout Thursday afternoon, the moderators continued to ask increasingly complex questions directed at the audience, who in turn would vote in the live poll.
The panelists, many of whom were Business School alumni, also responded to the questions, including “Does the current state of the medical devices market make the sector poised for greater venture investment?” and “Which of these emerging healthcare investment areas are most attractive: Analytics and Business Intelligence, Patient Engagement, or Value-Based Models Care Management and Coordination?”
In response to a question about investing in biotechnology firms, panelist Steve Kraus, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, claimed that there are better public companies to invest in, citing Twitter, which began trading publicly on Thursday.
Co-panelists Stephen Bloch, a partner at Canaan Partners, and Bijan Salehizadeh, a managing director at NaviMed Capital, disagreed, claiming that biotechnology firms were good investments.
While the audience split nearly down the middle when polled on this question, the slim majority of audience members voted against investing in medical technology firms.  Salehizadeh agreed, noting that “55 to 60 percent of medtech companies return less than 1X [lose money].”
In addition to Thursday’s panel, the conference will also host a number of other notable speakers, including Dean of Harvard Business School Nitin Nohria. On Friday, Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate Donald M. Berwick ’68 will speak alongside Benjamin E. Sasse ’94, a current candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nebraska. The pair will give a federal perspective on the difficulties of healthcare reform.
The HBSHAA, one of the largest Business School organizations according to HBSHAA President and Annual Conference Chairman Tom Robinson, is made up of over 800 alumni involved in the healthcare industry.
The association's press release cited that the two-day meeting “[brings] together the critical elements needed for innovation in healthcare—people, information, organizations, and education.”
According to Robinson, the HBSHAA prides itself on uniting alumni across the healthcare industry and allowing them to interact and exchange ideas. Their flagship event emphasizes that goal.
Conference attendee Jonathan M. Wyler said, “It’s a diverse audience within healthcare. My focus is in one little corner of healthcare and it’s a nice high quality group from whom to see a broader view.”
Robinson echoed similar hopes for the two-day conference.
 “This conference is one-of-a-kind,” said Robinson. “It is one of the few if not only meetings that allows for the idea-sharing of an interesting and informed group of Harvard Business School grads who specialize in the finance of health care.”

Nine years after its founding, Facebook is returning to Cambridge.
On Thursday, the social networking site announced plans to install a new engineering center in Kendall Square, a few T stops away from the Harvard campus where it was first founded.
The Kendall Square office building will be Facebook’s fifth engineering site, joining sites in Menlo Park, Seattle, New York, and London.
Ryan Mack, an infrastructure engineer who contributed to the development of Facebook’s Timeline feature, will lead the Cambridge site.
“In many ways, Boston was an easy choice,” he said in a written statement that appeared on Facebook. “The tech community here is world-class, from the incredible academic institutions to the vibrant startup ecosystem to the bevy of global  companies who have teams here. We are thrilled to have found a new home here and hope we can help the community continue to thrive.”
Mack started with a small team of engineers two and a half years ago, working throughout the greater Boston area, including public workspaces such as coffee shops and libraries.  He said he now plans to expand his team and utilize the new centralized office to tackle projects including “networking, storage, security, and language runtimes.”
After a few years in Boston, Mack and his team “reached a point where it made sense to open an office and start building out,” according to Facebook spokesperson Alex Hollander. This week marks the Cambridge site’s first week up and running.
In May of 2012, Massachusetts House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo encouraged the establishment of a Facebook site in Massachusetts in a personal appeal to founder Mark E. Zuckerberg, formerly of the Harvard College class of 2006.
“I welcome the decision of Facebook, a global brand name in the realm of social media, to open an office in Massachusetts,” DeLeo said yesterday in a statement. “For almost two years, I have been talking about our efforts to encourage Facebook to have a presence here in Massachusetts, where the idea for the company was first born.”
Kendall Square, the area of Cambridge where the new office will be located, has been a hotbed of innovation since a rise in development during the early 1990s. Also home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, it has since been a burgeoning hub for startups in the technology industry.
“It’s a great acknowledgement and testament to the amazing students both at Harvard in the greater Boston community that this is a place where they’d want to bring one of their main engineering centers to involve these students in the great things they’re doing,” said Neal A. Doyle, assistant director of the Harvard Innovation Lab.

In the 2013 cross country season to date, Harvard co-captains James Leakos and Maksim Korolev have faced 798 runners in four races, held on four different courses in four different states. And in each of those competitions, the duo has found its place on the top of the leaderboard.
Either Leakos or Korolev have finished in first or second place in the four races in which they have participated this season.
But the co-captains’ current success is coming after a summer of hard work and the guidance of a former Harvard cross country standout. Leakos and Korolev spent the past summer in Cambridge, working with Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School whose research focuses on venture capital and start-up, high-growth companies.
According to Gompers, Leakos and Korolev got the job after they approached him for career advice last spring, looking to explore the business field in more detail.
“It was a job that was both interesting for them and flexible enough for them to get in their training, and they were great,” Gompers said. “They were both just tremendous assets to my research team over the summer.”
While Gompers was at Harvard, he set a number of school records for the Crimson cross country and track and field teams. His record in the 10k for the cross country team still stands to this day. Gompers earned fifth place at the NCAA Championships in 1986 with the current-record time of 31:02.
But despite his strong running background, he insisted that aside from “build[ing] their confidence,” he didn’t have much to do with Leakos and Korolev’s actual training.
“I had a great experience here [at Harvard], so to be a faculty member here and a role model for the students is something I find very satisfying,” Gompers said.
Though they spent the summer together, the co-captains indicated that they rarely trained together. While Korolev battled an injury, Leakos upped the intensity of his usual summer training.
“I just got my mileage to points it had never been before,” Leakos said. “I’d never been a super high mileage guy, and I turned into one this summer.”
Leakos said that by the end of the summer, he was doing around 110 miles a week, while Korolev said that he was doing around 80 per week.
“I actually probably had one of the worst summers of my life,” Korolev said.  “I was really, really worried [going into this season].”
Last spring, Korolev finished the outdoor track and field season with a disappointing showing in the 10k at the NCAA Championships, where he finished last with a time of 33:55.
“I got triple-lapped and I ran slower than the winning girl in the 10k,” Korolev recalled, shaking his head.
“I couldn’t watch that race,” Leakos laughed.
Leakos and Korolev stated that they continue to train independently during the season, aside from long runs, which they try to limit because of the extent to which they push each other.
“We’re pretty sure that one day we might have done a 2:20 marathon pace for one of our 20-mile long runs,” Korolev said.
But the disparity of training styles has not prevented either Korolev or Leakos from turning in the best season of his career.
Leakos started off the season strong with a victory at the annual Harvard-Yale meet with an 8k time of 23:32, taking the title for the second time in his career.
Leakos also won the Paul Short Invitational, which he called his “breakout race.” He ran the second-fastest time in course history with a time of 23:13, at an average mile pace of 4:41.
Korolev brought his A-game to the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, ranking second out of 288 runners with an impressive time of 23:14, just two seconds shy of winner Kemoy Cambell of Arkansas.
Korolev continued to dominate the competition at the Heptagonal Championships on Nov. 2nd at Princeton, earning a time of 23:28, an individual title, and a conference-record in the 8k.
The co-captains’ individual successes have also helped to propel the team as a whole. At the Harvard-Yale Invitational, the Crimson defeated Yale, 15-42. The squad took fourth place out of 47 teams at the Paul Short Invitational, 13th out of 35 at Wisconsin, and fourth place at Heps.
“There are a bunch of people that are stepping up thanks to the leadership of James and Maks,” Gompers said. “I think that the men’s team, being nationally ranked, has a tremendous shot at qualifying for Nationals for the first time in over 30 years.”
Next up for the Crimson is the NCAA Northeast Regionals next Saturday. If Harvard hopes to advance to Nationals, it will need a strong performance across the board.
But at the moment, Leakos is fighting a leg injury. Inflamed tendons relegated him to the sidelines at Heps and have made it hard for him to run, forcing him to “sweat it out in the pool” as an alternative to running. He stated that, regardless of the pain, he would not sit out of Regionals and that he’s recovering.
“It’s just been miserable. But today, I was able to walk down the stairs normally,” Leakos joked.
Korolev and Leakos have set high expectations for themselves and for the team coming into the final stretch of the season.
“I’m certainly hopeful that Maks or James can beat my fifth-place finish at Nationals in cross country and I hope both of them go well under that 10k record,” Gompers said. “I don’t think any other team in the country has two guys as good as Maks and James. A lot of teams have one good guy, but to have two guys as good as Maks and James is very special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With both teams preparing to vie for their respective league championships, the Harvard and Holy Cross men’s soccer teams took a break from their conference schedules to do battle Wednesday night.
Led by senior goaltender Brett Conrad’s four saves, the Crimson (6-7-2, 4-1-0 Ivy) defeated the Crusaders (7-8-1, 5-3-0 Patriot) at Linda Johnson Smith Soccer Stadium, 1-0.
“Brett probably played the best game that I’ve ever seen him play,” coach Pieter Lehrer said. “He was aggressive, and when he is aggressive, he is a pro-level goalie.”
The win is the first of the season for Conrad, who despite 44 saves this year had been 0-7-1 in his first eight tries.
Conrad has grown quite comfortable playing against Holy Cross over the years. The senior goalkeeper has earned three shutout wins in his career with the Crimson—all of which have come against the Crusaders.
Harvard struck thirty minutes into the game. After earning his third corner kick of the contest, senior defender Ross Friedman sent a cross flying into the box. Junior midfielder Matt Sheeleigh got his head on the ball and gently pushed it ahead to sophomore forward Oliver White.
From the six-yard line, White jumped into the air and drove home a bicycle kick between two Holy Cross defenders to give the Crimson the lead. Crusader goalkeeper Michael Thompson, who had seven saves on the night, was left with no time to react to the strike.
“It was a great finish,” Friedman said. “That’s something we’ve been talking about. Ollie was on his toes, really hunting for the ball. That’s something we try to do in the box because the ball bounces all over the place. We need guys hunting for the ball, so kudos to Ollie for being ready.”
White, after scoring three times as a freshman last year, became the 13th member of the Harvard squad to score a goal this season.
This depth was put on display early as Lehrer elected to make seven substitutions in the first 20 minutes of the game, allowing some of the reserves to get additional playing time. Among the substitutions was Conrad, who entered the game in the 11th minute for sophomore goalkeeper Evan Mendez.
Even with a new-look lineup, the Crimson managed to put constant pressure on the Holy Cross back line and played a physical game in the midfield from the first to last whistle.
“It’s no surprise to me that [the reserves] came out and did a great job,” Friedman said. “This is stuff I see day in and day out in practice from them. They are huge contributors to every game and it was great to see them getting run on the field.”
Despite trailing for the majority of the game, the Crusaders came within inches of tying the game with less than six minutes remaining. Holy Cross forward Ty Goncalves carried the ball up the right wing and launched a cross towards the net. Freshman midfielder Matt Villano was left all alone in the box, but his diving header in front of the keeper went wide right.
After last weekend’s 2-1 victory over Dartmouth, Lehrer emphasized that he wanted his players to bring the same amount of intensity that they have been showing in the first half of games to the second period. On Wednesday, the coach said that he was happy with his team’s response.
“I thought we did a better job at halftime as a staff trying to get guys prepared for the second half,” Lehrer said. ‘They came out and they were fighting…There was not really much of a let up.”
After controlling possession on the Crusaders’ side of the pitch for the majority of the first period, Harvard picked up right where they had left off, quickly generating multiple scoring opportunities.
In the 69th minute, junior forward Hiroki Kobayashi cut around two Holy Cross defenders inside the box, leaving him one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, the forward tried to make an extra pass and the chance was averted.
Four minutes later, Harvard failed to convert another chance as junior defender Phillip Fleischman earned a breakaway from midfield but pushed his shot wide left, failing to put the Crusaders away.
However, the back line stood tall for the Crimson as the team earned its third shutout of the year.
The hosts out-shot Harvard 13-11 on the game, but the Crimson doubled the Crusaders in shots on goal, 8-4.
“It’s a true testament to our team’s character how it doesn’t really matter who’s on the field,” Conrad said. “We’re going to stick to the same game plan and the same process, and the result was successful. [It was a] big step forward for our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard football team, this week has been one of many adjustments after losing major players to injuries.
“We’ve had more injuries this year than any year that I can remember in a long time,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “It seems like at every juncture we’re being challenged to fill some gaps.”
Harvard pulled off a last-minute win against Dartmouth last weekend while lacking players in key positions. With a number of starters out, different team members stepped up to contribute to the 24-21 victory.
“When somebody goes down, there’s another player ready to step in,” junior kicker Andrew Flesher said. “Generally most people who are on the two or three deep roster are ready to go for the game.”
Injured members of the team include senior tight end Cameron Brate, senior center David Leopard, junior linebacker Connor Sheehan, sophomore wide receiver Fischer, and senior kicker David Mothander.
Brate has spearheaded the Harvard attack this season with a team-high four touchdown receptions. His recent knee injury, which occurred a week before the Princeton game, means that fellow tight ends senior Tyler Ott, junior Tyler Hamblin, and sophomore Ben Braunecker should see more playing time and responsibility in upcoming games.
Three weeks ago, Mothander was hurt in practice prior to the Lafayette game.  Mothander is the most effective Harvard kicker of all time, holding the Crimson’s career scoring record with 229 points. In his absence, Flesher has been able to step up, namely with the last-minute 23-yard field goal that clinched the win over Dartmouth.
“I was shocked when David went down,” Flesher said. “But being the number two kicker, you pretty much [get] the same number of kicks during the practice week, so as long as you have a good mindset going into Saturday, everything should go pretty smoothly.”
Leopard, who was hurt in the Princeton game, and Sheehan, who went down against Lafayette, had been crucial to the squad’s success. Leopard had been a large presence on an already-depleted offensive line, while Sheehan intercepted and returned a pass for 35 yards and made two tackles in the game where he was injured.
Fischer, who tore his hamstring against Princeton, had caught three touchdown passes on the season in addition to his duties returning kicks.
Other starters have been slowly adapting to working with different players in the positions that sustained injuries. According to Murphy, sophomore tackles Adam Redmond and Cole Toner have been played alongside a new teammate almost every week.
Murphy mentioned that both senior wide receiver Scott Miller and senior offensive lineman Nick Easton, who has taken over Leopard’s duties at center, will have to step up.
“It definitely is very challenging,” Murphy said. “The bottom line is that we have to adapt.”

One day, it’s bright and sunny and lovely. You get up the next morning and bam. Rain. It’s back.
 
Marking the unofficial end to summer in New England, rain has arrived and it’s all downhill from here. Pretty soon, the enjpoyable 40s and 50s will slope down to the dismal 30s, heralding snow and sharp winds to cut through our jackets and turn our new umbrellas inside out. Plus, mud. Mud everywhere. Your new shoes can’t escape this perdition.
 
Is there anything worse than rain at Harvard? Puddles form all over the Yard, clogging up foot traffic, and filling up the cobblestone sinkholes near Pinocchio’s on JFK. It’s just miserable and requires running and effort, and no one has time for that during midterms. How are the night owls supposed to get their caffeine from Starbucks if it’s raining outside? Nobody wants to be misted on while walking with an increasingly soggy cardboard cup of coffee.
 
Ugh.
The struggle.

 You know that the time has come to say goodbye to your beloved, daily iced coffee if any or all of the below apply to you: 1. Even with waterproof mittens you can feel the coolness. 2. Drops of perspiration on the plastic freeze. 3. You can no longer take the weird looks you get from the barista when they ask, skeptically, “Iced?”
 
 We at Flyby have come up with a list of substitutes that will get you through the winter without having to settle for the monotonous cup of joe.
FOR THE HEALTH ADDICT: Black coffee with skim milk and splenda—sorry.
FOR THE LACTOSE INTOLERANT: Chai Tea Latte with Soy—only for those who aren’t bothered by the people behind them rolling their eyes.
FOR THE SWEET-TOOTH: Cafe Mocha—we all know this just means putting hot chocolate in your coffee, but it’s okay.
FOR THE JET-SETTER: Cafe Au Lait—honestly it’s just coffee with milk, but the French makes it sound fancy.
FOR THE LAMONSTER: Double shot of espresso—just down it and power through.
FOR THE AUTUMN-OBSESSED: Pumpkin Spice Latte—with a side of Instagram and #harvardinautumn.
FOR THE HIPSTER: Black coffee, no milk, no sugar—it’s all about intensity, right?
FOR THE WORLDLY: Cappuccino with biscotti—make sure to drink it with your pinky raised.
FOR THE MIRACULOUSLY WELL-RESTED: Hot chocolate—no one can see what’s inside that cup anyway.
FOR THE PRODIGY: Apple cider—you’re too young for caffeine, it will kill your brain cells, and the world needs them.

As I waited to hear back from schools, I developed elaborate college preference rankings in my mind. “Brown’s okay,” I said to myself, “but is it really, truly my first choice? Maybe I’d be better off at Yale.” So it went, my mind spinning elaborate illusions in which I had to choose between all six of my reach schools. How would I ever pick?
 
As March moved towards April, acceptance letters began to trickle in. First up was WashU in mid-March. I’d just visited the weekend before and had never expected to hear from any schools so soon. I was nearly crying as I opened the envelope—no email notification here! It was a perfectly unexpected surprise on a Friday afternoon at the end of a long week at school. Over the next two weeks, I heard back from a growing list of schools: yeses from Brandeis, BU, and GWU (all with merit scholarships) and more acceptances from Tufts and Wesleyan. So far, so good: My mid-levels and safeties were perfectly on target.
 
Then came April 1st. Two of my best friends—one a junior, and one already admitted early-decision to her first-choice college—had offered to sit with me as I received my news at 5 p.m. We went biking in the local park that afternoon, which proved a better choice, by far, than lying around waiting. My stomach was doing somersaults, but the invigorating spring air did me a world of good.
 
We returned, showered, and sat down at my computer for judgment day. Amherst: waitlisted. Columbia: rejected. Yale: rejected. Brown: rejected. Harvard: waitlisted. My UPenn online login wasn’t working. Maybe there was still hope! I was on the phone with their admissions office, trying to get into the student portal. But by 5:30, the news was absolute: rejected from UPenn. I wasn’t crying. I accepted everything as calmly as I could. My friends seemed nervous: this wasn’t what I’d expected, and not what they had, either. I called my mom, my voice flat, just the facts. I’d process later. April 1 was always going to be either a great day or an awful one. Planning ahead, I’d bought Vampire Weekend concert tickets for that night with a friend, knowing that I’d either want to celebrate or be distracted from disappointment.
 
I bid goodbye to my friends at my house, hopped on a train downtown, and met up with my other friend at the concert. I tried to be an enthusiastic companion, but I was so upset I could barely muster any excitement. “Vampire Weekend met at Columbia,” I said morosely, “and now I’ll never go there. Never.”
 
My friend hadn’t had the greatest April 1 herself, but I selfishly plowed on. “Now my only options are Wesleyan or WashU! I can’t believe this happened.” She reasonably tried to tell me that those were great schools, but I was having none of it. I stared at the band in misery. Ivy dreams dashed, future ruined, I moaned. I spoiled the concert for both of us, wallowing in my privileged disappointment.
 
This mood was only to persist over the next few weeks. Stay tuned for the next installment, in which I inflict my long-suffering mother with my persistent Debbie Downer attitude.
