After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LONDON—“Nikhil, watch the toast. I’ll be right back,” I told the other occupant of the kitchen, as I ducked out to get some honey from my room. Earlier that day, I had been attacked by a sudden craving for honey on toast, and I was finally ready to satisfy it.
When I returned to the kitchen less than a minute later, smoke was pouring from the toaster and Nikhil was gazing absentmindedly out the window. I swore loudly and yanked the power cord from the wall, causing Nikhil to jump in alarm. “Dude! Didn’t I tell you to watch the toast?!”
The windows in the kitchen have restrictors, presumably so that if there’s a fire you die by burning alive instead of by jumping from the second floor. The air thick with smoke, I removed two black slices of bread from the appliance and replaced them with soft white ones. Within seconds, the toaster was spewing smoke again.
Another bout of swearing and cord-yanking followed, but I wasn’t able to save my precious toast, which had once again been sacrificed to the gods of charcoal. As it was by now impossible to see across the room, I opened the door to the hallway so that the smoke could clear out. Dumb move. Within seconds, the fire alarm went off and all hell broke loose.
On the street outside the dorm, surrounded by several dozen disgruntled occupants of the building, I watched mortified as two fire trucks pulled up with their alarms blaring and a troupe of firemen leapt out. I felt horrified at having woken people up from naps and caused the firemen unnecessary trouble. Worst of all, I still hadn’t eaten my toast.
Once the building was declared safe and we were able to go back inside, I found out that the mishap had occurred because the toaster hadn’t been cleaned properly. A new toaster was installed; this one refused to turn on. Later that day, I managed to locate a kitchen with a toaster that was neither intent on murder nor dead, and finally ate my toast.
As I’ll be cooking a lot of my own food this summer, I learned a valuable lesson: don’t leave the kitchen unattended. Even the simplest things can go up in flames—just ask my toast.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia—I took a trip to Petersburg but ended up in Leningrad. I tread on a manhole cover labeled “City of Leningrad.” I pass the Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology, proudly bearing a plaque that reads “Leningrad Institute of Technology.” A sign, nearly seventy years old, warns residents of Leningrad to avoid the right side of the street in the event of a shelling. An enormous statue of Vladimir Lenin stands delivering his famous pre-revolutionary speech, frozen forever in impassioned soliloquy.
In the twentieth century alone, Petersburg has known the names St. Petersburg, Petrograd, Leningrad, and St. Petersburg once again. Leningrad’s name change halfheartedly masks the Soviet past that is cemented in the collective memory of its citizens and the beautiful buildings and monuments of its cities. Surrounded by these vestiges, I delightedly walk, ruminate, and live in the same Russia in which my friends and relatives walked, ruminated, and lived, at the brink of the Oktyabrskaya Revolutsia (October Revolution), or in the heart of the Soviet Union, or on the edge of the socialist state’s collapse. I am simultaneously in modern, extravagant St. Petersburg and old, enigmatic Leningrad, shrouded in mystery.
Worlds apart, the two cities struggle in vain to surmount each other. St. Petersburg, bold and pompous, promises to steer Russia into a decadent, capitalist future. But the same Russians who crow and swoon at Peter's promise turn their backs to face Lenin's statue and lay roses at his massive feet. Petersburg and Leningrad—at once modernized and mythologized, accessible and unknowable, two cities and one—converge to form a single imposing, beautiful Russia.

SYDNEY—It’s hard to put your finger on that funny feeling you get when you walk around Chinatown. There’s something not quite right, you know, but it’s not really Chinatown you’re suspicious of—it’s you. It’s a familiar sensation: the same vaguely exploitative feeling you get when you wear a retro band T-shirt from a group you’ve never properly listened to, or when you’re hitting on someone and suddenly forget their name.
You shrug and saunter out of the sun to hunt down some bubble tea.
You used to love the place, back when you were best mates with S. in the eighth grade. The two of you were a mean pair, alright, with you playing it cool in baggy jeans while he—a ball-playing, chain-wearing Asian kid who always regretted being born in a beachside paradise instead of the Bronx—pointed out all the best spots: real Chinese places, not the fake little joints set up for you dumb, fat whities. But after the two of you fell out, you didn’t go back so often and the nagging feeling began to sink in that either you or Chinatown were a bit of a fake.
Today you walk around, sweating in the winter sun as you try to reason out that familiar discomfort. Chinatown is a wonderful show, for sure—droves of tourists snap away at Multicultural Australia’s favorite son; teenagers in hoodies giggle over their melon cakes and the bustling treatment they underwent to get them—but you can’t decide who runs the show and for whom, and this seems to be very important right now.
A little kid runs past, grinning wildly and with each pace bouncing like a wind-up toy. His T-shirt draws half a smile: I’M AWESOME GET USED TO IT. The mall is enclosed by what are presumably traditional Chinese gates, and you quietly grin at the shop fronts you pass: Hot Teas. Australia Souvenir. Fashion N Me. There are a lot of mixed-race couples in the noodle bar, all of them white guys with Asian girlfriends—you find this sort of funny, but they are too busy being in love to notice.
You head out the gates and up the street, past Scruffy Murphy’s and past OzTurk 25 HRS/DAY, past Golden Palace where your mates used to drink underage with hopeful fake IDs (“Hold on, guys,“ L. hypothesized one day, “if they all look the same to us…”). Out you go into the city and you get a bit sentimental for this funny old place, held together not by assimilation but osmosis, not with intercultural dialogue but from all being neighbors under the same hot bloody sun.
And then you get home and start to write about it, but as you go you decide you should probably be a bit more PC on the matter: Americans are touchy about these things, and Antipodean bluntness can be a bit insensitive at times. So you try and make your language properly embracing.
But then you pause while you’re speculating about the integrity of Chinatown—whether it’s a proper home for Chinese Australians, or a welcome sign for Chinese New Australians, or a show put on by Chinese Australians for non-Chinese Australians, or a show put on by non-Chinese Australians for Chinese New Australians and for non-Australian Chinese that might become Chinese New Australians—yes, you pause, and as you do, you realize that you just completely missed the point of the whole bloody thing.

In a step toward centralizing Harvard’s currently disparate information technology services, the University has announced the formation of a unified IT organization, marking the launch of a wide-ranging effort to increasing the efficacy and organization of Harvard’s computer services.
By merging IT services that have previously been separated between the University’s central administration and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the new body will provide IT support for both students and faculty. With 456 staffers, the new centralized body is part of a broader overhaul of IT services at the University that is intended to result in more user-friendly services and better support.
“We’re going through all of this change to be able to provide technology that will ultimately make it easier for the faculty and students to do their work,” said Chief Information Officer Anne H. Margulies, who was hired for the newly minted position last year.
Harvard University Information Technology officially launched on June 15.
Margulies has lead the charge in reforming Harvard’s sometimes creaky IT system and says that she hopes to put in place an IT framework to enable high-caliber academic work and that will nurture students’ talents.
“We probably have the next Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard today, so we need to provide support for student innovations that can benefit the rest of the university and beyond,” Margulies said.
The effort to centralize the IT system appears to be in line with University President Drew G. Faust’s vision of “one University,” a set of policies that are aimed at breaking down barriers between the different parts of Harvard to encourage greater interdisciplinary research.
But the announcement of a more centralized bureaucracy is only the first step on a long road of reform that is likely to extend over the course of the next year. Margolies says that HUIT, for example, has plans to update email clients. In particular, Margulies noted that Harvard excess of email clients—currently over 30—made email and calendar use unnecessarily difficult.
The new email infrastructure, which Margulies was hesitant to detail due to further planning involved, still maintains an uncertain future for college students, whose typical use of email, Margulies said, spans a little a more than what faculty require.
“We’re moving toward a common email client for faculty and staff across the University, and we’re exploring options for undergraduates,” said Margulies, who added that the existing system wastes “enormous amounts of time.”
In further administrative reshuffling, the organization will also rename a large portion of the titles and positions to more accurately reflect the organization’s current purpose. Some of the reforms will be announced in a few weeks.
Though the centralization will require restructuring, Marguiles said that there will be no staff layoffs as a result. Instead, employees will be regrouped to streamline their work processes.
“One benefit of bringing together the two former organizations is to create deeper expertise and critical mass of skills for better service,” Margulies said.
Margulies said that a survey of IT staff members found that many employees identified themselves as "generalists," indicating that some might have to be retrained to specialize in more advanced fields.
“Technology is becoming so complex, we really need deep expertise in every type of it,” she said

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John Devir, a highly touted recent hire at Harvard Management Company, will not be joining the organization and has instead accepted an offer at Pacific Investment Management Company.
Devir, who was HMC’s third senior hire in the past year, will serve as an executive vice president for PIMCO's credit-analysis team.
PIMCO, the giant bond investment firm, is currently headed by former HMC CEO and President Mohamed A. El-Erian, who left after a brief two year stint at the Harvard organization. HMC is the organization responsible for managing the University's endowment.
At the time of the announcement of his hiring, HMC Head of Internal Management Stephen Blyth said that Devir would bring "extensive experience of equity markets in the Americas and Europe to Harvard’s internal investment team.”
Devir was to serve as HMC’s managing director of stocks in developed markets. University Spokesman John Longbrake told Bloomberg only that Devir “would no longer be joining the investment team” and declined to comment further.
Devir’s departure is emblematic of HMC’s long-running difficulty in retaining talented hires. In perhaps the best known example, when former CEO of HMC Jack R. Meyer left to start his own hedge fund, he took 30 of HMC’s employees with him.
One of HMC’s challenges has been in managing compensation levels, which Meyer has said strained HMC's relationship with the University. While salaries of portfolio managers are well below Wall Street standards, critics have said HMC investors are paid excessively given the company’s altruistic mission.
Jane L. Mendillo, the current CEO of HMC, has modified the compensation structure so that salaries of investors are tied even more closely to investment performance. Mendillo has also bolstered HMC’s “clawback” policy, extending the number of years that compensation is subject to review.
Nevertheless, HMC has lost a number of top employees to the private sector in recent years while at the same time Mendillo has sought to strengthen the organization’s internal staff.
In her 2010 Annual Report, Mendillo said that “the environment for attracting investment talent and experience to HMC has been favorable over the last two years and we have taken advantage of this opportunity.”
HMC appears to be entering a period of relative stability, following years of shifting leadership and after weathering heavy losses during the financial crisis that began in 2008. The endowment lost 30 percent of its value during the recession.
Recently Harvard has begun to recover, posting an 11 percent gain in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, which brought the endowment’s value to $27.4 billion, the largest in higher education.

Willliam and Kate weren’t the only famous Brits stateside this week as British football club and English Premier League champions Manchester United took time off today from their pre-season training tour to visit Harvard Tuesday.
The team took pictures with the John Harvard statue and University President Drew G. Faust, who presented team captain Nemanja Vidic and head coach Sir Alex Ferguson with Harvard sweatshirts. Faust gave the rest of the team Harvard caps.
The team draped John Harvard in a Man U scarf for the occasion, but Barcelona fans will be happy to hear that each Man U player rubbed the toe.
While Park Ji-Sung posed for pictures with delighted tourists, Rio Ferdinand took pictures of Harvard Yard with his cell phone. He joked with his teammates, saying “You want to study here? You can’t study here. Neither can you.”
Later that day, former Man U player Dennis Irwin led a clinic at Harvard Stadium for students in Man U’s soccer school.
But if any English soccer team were to visit Harvard—and foist its colors onto the school's namesake—perhaps it's only appropriate that it would be Man U. Both the school and the team are, after all, two of the most storied yet resented organizations in the world and share equally insufferable hangers on ("the Harvard man" and Man U fans).
The team is in town to play the New England Revolution in Gillette Stadium Wednesday.

When the final Harry Potter movie is released Friday morning at midnight—or Thursday evening, if you're lucky—the childhoods of many will be as dead as Dumbledore. On the bright side, the end of childhood signals the beginning of adulthood, and what better way to celebrate than by ordering another round of fire whiskey (21+ unless you're in Hogsmeade) and partying like it’s time for the nonexistent-but-hey-we-can-still-dream Harry Potter 8.
As Harry, Ron, and Hermione know, there’s no better way to go out than with wands blazing, and as we know from the last time a Harry Potter movie came out, there's no better way to watch “The Deathly Hallows: Part 2" than with drinks pouring.
The Rules
—Whenever Hermione has a concerned look on her face, drink up.
—Whenever Voldemort casts a killing curse, take cover under your Invisibility Cloak and drink up.
—If you see any awkward sexual tension—real or imagined—take a hearty gulp.
—Whenever you hear ominous music, take a drink.
—Whenever Hermione looks especially fine, take a drink. (Limit yourself to two per scene, please)
—If a basilisk, hippogriff, or other magical creature comes on screen, drink up.
—Whenever Ron falls, take a sip. (Caution: Be prepared for a Hagrid-sized hangover!)
—Whenever the Deathly Hallows are mentioned, take a drink.
—During the Battle of Hogwarts, take a sip whenever a colorful spell flits across the screen.
—When Harry and Voldemort meet face to face on-screen, kill your drink.
—After the epilogue ends and the credits start rolling, raise your goblet and give a toast to The Boy Who Lived.
Want more fun? Check out our rules for "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1" in Fifteen Minutes magazine. And just to be clear, don't actually do any of this—besides the part about seeing Harry Potter, of course.
