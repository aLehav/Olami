A premature leak mere days after an initial announcement is an inauspicious beginning for any album’s release. Inauspicious, that is, if the final product—ultimately released two months earlier than anticipated—leaves room for anyone to think those months might have been put to some productive purpose. Björk’s “Vulnicura,” though hastily released, is impressively complete. The album relies almost entirely on three sources of sound: Björk’s pure vocals, orchestral strings, and an assortment of electronic noises used frequently for percussion. It is thus arguably Björk’s most coherent album to date; remarkably, this costs it nothing creatively. On each track Björk weaves together her arsenal of tools in an entirely distinct fashion so that no song simply falls into the background of the album. “Vulnicura” finds a place in Björk’s impressive body of work in much the same way—it is emblematic of her individual style, and yet it goes even farther than her earlier work in its unified sound.
What most markedly establishes this cohesion is not quite a similarity in the sounds of the tracks—rather, each has its own character—but the continuity Björk as well as co-producers Arca and The Haxan Cloak demonstrate in their assemblage. Each song gives the strings, often minimalist groupings of violin and cello, a primary role in its instrumentation. Simultaneously, Björk ensures that this construction does not become repetitive by utilizing the strings in a distinct way in every track. The album opens with lilting, expressive cello notes that continue through the rest of “Stonemilker.” On the next track, “Lionsong,” Björk and a violin share the melody during the chorus, a choice that succeeds only because the power and clarity of her voice rival those of the instrument. In “Black Lake,” the strings complement Björk in an entirely different fashion and play long, caressing notes that leave her voice almost a cappella. She even uses the strings to create entirely different types of sound: “Atom Dance” is distinguished as a dance by the pizzicato with which it opens, while the dissonant sounds that characterize its later half seem to have been played on the wrong side of the instruments’ bridges.
Björk and her fellow producers not only use the instruments diversely but also match them to her lyrical content. She goes much farther than simply using pizzicato to craft one song into dance. The music in “Black Lake,” for example, frequently seems to be bringing the 10-minute song to an end until Björk comes in for further verses, [a choice that powerfully depicts her struggle to let go of her former relationship with artist Matthew Barney, which the song describes. “History of Touches” takes Björk's coupling of instrumental and lyrical emotion furthest: its instrumentation is primarily comprised of rippling synthesizer notes that seem to represent the “touches” Björk mentions. When she speaks not of each “touch” but each “fuck,” the notes follow her meaning, growing darker and more intense. The ability that Björk demonstrates throughout her album to portray imagery through music is perhaps more authentic than that of any other contemporary musician.
With her lyrics, too, Björk conveys her meanings in an effective, potent fashion to which few other artists have access. She utilizes words in unconventional, surprising combinations; in “Black Lake,” for example, she complains to her lover that she is “bored of your apocalyptic obsessions.” She depicts love just as beautifully as heartbreak: in “Atom Dance,” she sings “we are each other’s hemispheres,” a metaphor that insightfully conveys the sense of wholeness one feels in a relationship. Her most artistic use of language, however, comes in the oddly named “Stonemilker,” whose title is explained when Björk sings, “What is it that I have / That makes me feel your pain? / Like milking a stone / To get you to say it.” The image is so simultaneously bizarre and impactful that it would be worthy of the most accomplished novelist.
With her command of language, Björk may have been an arresting writer; all the luckier for her fans, then, that she chose to express her talents in the realm of music. Her decades-long career has already seen far more than its fair share of success, and so in this sense, “Vulnicura” is just another element in an already predictable pattern of achievement. Yet Björk’s eighth album manages to be prominent among an impressive discography in the profound subtlety and insight she express in each track. If Björk had not already established a firm place for herself in the history of music, “Vulnicura” alone would have solidified her standing.

Punch Brothers are masters at generating an incredible specificity of feeling, and their latest release, “The Phosphorescent Blues,” may be the best example of this talent yet. The bandmates have written songs that capture with precision and depth emotional situations like a moment of bliss in old age or recognizing a familiar song. Produced by T Bone Burnett, who has worked with the band on previous projects, including the Coen brothers film “Inside Llewyn Davis,” “The Phosphorescent Blues” provides at once the signature genre-blending and masterful lyrical and melodic storytelling expected from Punch Brothers as well as a bonanza of rich surprises.
Pop songs can elicit visceral reactions from us, but these reactions are often lacking in nuance—“I feel sad,” “I want to dance.” Classical pieces, on the other hand, while generally more complex in emotional hues, may require more cerebral effort. Yet somehow “The Phosphorescent Blues” is replete with tracks that marry these two modes of emotional response. “My Oh My” and “Forgotten” each have slowed down choruses whose melodies perfectly express the precise sentiments of their lyrics. In fact, they far outdo words—stale from use—in articulating those sentiments. “My oh my, what a wonderful day / We're having” sings principal vocalist, Chris Thile, accompanied by his bandmates, and listeners may feel they’re having that thought for the first time. Similarly, on “Forgotten,” when they sing “Hey there, it's all gonna be fine / You ain't gonna die alone / You ain't gonna be forgotten,” it strikes a primal and emotional chord rarely, if ever, touched by hearing those words alone.
“The Phosphorescent Blues” is perhaps Punch Brothers’ most unified album. As in the Magritte painting “The Lovers, ” which serves as the album artwork, details are felt through a consistent texture. According to Chris Thile, mandolin player and lead vocalist for the group, “The Phosphorescent Blues” was inspired by the question, “how do we cultivate beautiful, three-dimensional experiences with our fellow man in this day and age?” This theme is apparent throughout, lyrically, and even, in an abstract sense, melodically. With the exception of  “Magnet”—which has a rough-edged energy that might have been more at home on the band’s last album, “Who’s Feeling Young Now?”—there is an almost floral sweetness to each of the tracks.
The album is bookended by the two tracks most obviously concerned with connection in the digital age. “Familiarity” becomes increasingly dreamlike and ecstatic as Thile sings about recognizing a song that is familiar to everyone in a club. The scene oscillates between club and church as his experience grows into a spiritual one and takes the characters in the song away from their phones. The final track, “Little Lights,” is also concerned with our screen obsession. The song is a modern take on “This Little Light Of Mine,” and according to the band’s website, it “imagines countless smart phones held in the air as a symbol of hope and possibility.” At the end of the song the band is joined by a chorus of voices, actually the recorded submissions of fans. While the song is a tad blander than some of the others, together with “Familiarity” it gives the album a clear conceptual structure.
The coherence of “The Phosphorescent Blues” brings to mind  Punch Brothers’ first album, “Punch,” which was dominated by “The Blind Leaving the Blind” Movements One through Four, each roughly ten minutes long. In fact, “Familiarity,” the first track on “The Phosphorescent Blues,” is itself just over ten minutes long and sets the tone of continuity. This more musically classical album will surely appeal to some listeners more than others. There are fewer obvious stand-alone hits on this album compared to the band’s second album, “Antifogmatic,” on which each song has such a discrete flavor. That being said, “The Phosphorescent Blues”’s poppiest jam, “I Blew it Off,” which was unsurprisingly the album’s lead single, is a barnstormer. It features a dollop of electric guitar and, for the first time on a Punch Brothers album, drums, which lead listeners into the chorus. It also has one of the best lines on the album: “I’ve got an American share / Of 21st Century stress.”
All things considered, it’s hard to imagine any Punch Brothers fan would be disappointed. “The Phosphorescent Blues” is pure Punch Brothers, but, in keeping with the variety we've seen from them thus far, thoroughly fresh and original. Their sound suggests they are a closer-knit team than ever, but they haven’t become so polished that the music feels unemotional or inhuman. Rather they continue to demonstrate their gutsiness and passion in exploring and breaking down the boundaries of genre in order to reach the root of emotions and the human experience.

In the Cold War, hockey was a great equalizer, pitting the Soviets against the world in fair competition. For a long time, the Soviets conquered on that battlefield. In his new documentary, “Red Army,” director Gabe Polsky pulls back the iron curtain to reveal the secrets of the Soviet machine that generated not only some of the greatest hockey players of all time but also men whose passion for the sport became muddled by politics and corruption. “Red Army” succeeds as an insightful history lesson on the symbolic and ideological conflict embodied by the hockey games that occurred during this time. What separates this political documentary from others is its deeply passionate portrayal of the men behind the Soviet success.
Born to Soviet immigrants himself, Polsky expresses a deep reverence for the Russian Five and provides an unusually sympathetic look at the Soviet system from whence they came. Polsky tastefully splices together different pieces of broadcast footage of these men in action to showcase the elegant, graceful, and systematic destruction they wrought on their opponents. It is not necessary to understand hockey to see that they were incredibly skillful. Interviews with the players reveal scarred and exhausted human beings who were disillusioned by the Soviet Union. The audience is treated to the players’ stories of happiness, camaraderie, loss, betrayal, and tragedy. The film’s most affecting moments are simple shots of players being brought to tears. In particular, Vladimir Krutov’s interviews voicing his inability to adjust to a Western lifestyle are tragic. Missing his home and struggling with his weight, Krutov stresses the difficulty of transitioning to life in America for a man so used to strict control and order. His interview is all the more poignant in light of the fact that he died mere months after the film’s completion.
When the film is not providing a psychological examination of the Soviet players, it is a fun and sharp piece of historical entertainment. Skillful editing seamlessly juggles broadcast clips and interviews into an involving movie. The players’ personalities are particularly engrossing. Viacheslav Fetisov is the most vocal of the players in the film and brings an irreverent, cocky, and tongue-in-cheek personality that is manifest in the film’s biting, satirical tone. The audience’s first introduction to Fetisov begins with him flipping off the camera.
However, while the film is effective, it suffers from its simple and lopsided portrayal of the events that took place: It is entrenched in a primarily Soviet perspective of the conflict. While the film presents the exodus of Russian hockey players to other nations as a good thing, it never provides a non-Russian perspective. It is shocking not to see more opinions from NHL players, or from team coaches who contended with the Russians themselves. The result is an unchallenged message that avoids interesting complications to its bluntly sympathetic portrayal of these players’ defections to America. It is this minor shortcoming that nudges the film closer to the propaganda of the system it so overtly criticizes.
“Red Army” plays out as a history lesson on the one hand and a personal story on the other. The balance between these two elements is difficult to achieve, yet the film succeeds in both informing and entertaining. This is a documentary worthy of viewing, regardless of whether one is a hockey lover or not. Even if its rhetoric is not as sophisticated as it could have been, “Red Army” is a passionate, driven, and human look into a group of men.

“It’s comforting to think that even [Mozart] has mortal fallibility,” pianist and Harvard professor emeritus Robert Levin said at an open rehearsal in Sanders Theatre on Sunday. Conducted with the members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and focused on the composer’s Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, the performance was one in a series of events at Harvard with conductor Sir John Eliot Gardiner, the music department’s inaugural Christoph Wolff Distinguished Visiting Scholar for the year.
Gardiner is an acclaimed conductor who has appeared as a guest conductor for some of the world’s most prominent orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the London Symphony Orchestra, and the Vienna Philharmonic. His visit as the Christoph Wolff Distinguished Visiting Scholar culminated in Sunday night’s performance, which was meant not only to showcase classical music but also to delve into the intricacies—and, in Levin’s words, fallibility—of Mozart.
Sunday’s concert functioned as a workshop rather than only a showcase of the finished product. As HRO members performed certain sections, Gardiner and Levin offered their opinions on the orchestra’s execution and on the concerto as a whole. A few lines into the opening movement, Levin directed the discussion toward Mozart’s manuscript of the piece by highlighting the orchestra’s pace and its familiarity to the listener. “It seems axiomatic that the pace should unfold in that order because that is how you’ve heard it,” Levin said. As he immediately revealed, however, popular knowledge of the concerto is incomplete. Levin claimed that Mozart’s original manuscript had different pacing and ordering, but the composer later modified the piece to its final form—a conclusion supported by the corrective cue signs drawn onto the manuscript. This revelation segued into the HRO members’ performance of the opening segment as Mozart had written originally, an experience Gardiner afterward described as strange.
The performance was full of such moments as Gardiner and Levin delved further into the concerto and its reflection of Mozart as an artist. “The C minor manuscript is unique...in its disorder,” Levin said. According to him, Mozart tended to adjust the time spent on his compositions around his other commissions; this habit resulted in instances in which he would work on three pieces simultaneously. For Levin, the muddled drafts prove that Mozart is not the perfect genius of popular perception. “There’s something much more human [about Mozart], much less puppet-like than what is painted,” he said.
This more emotive aspect of Mozart became the focal point of the rehearsal as Gardiner encouraged greater expression from HRO members to better reflect the intricacy within Mozart’s compositions. “You could definitely feel that [Gardiner] was bringing a different perspective, a huge amount of knowledge to the music…. He was so invested in the music that he made you want to feel like you were invested in the music as well,” says Wentong Zhang ’18, a violinist in HRO.
Gardiner also focused on the interaction among the orchestral sections. “There’s so much wonderful dialogue between the piano and the wind instruments,” he said at one point. To foster this communication, he directed the HRO members to play their parts in a complementary manner—once asking wind instruments to slowly soften and string instruments to move up the scale as a way to make the piece converge. “This is music to converse with. It’s essentially dialectic,” Gardiner said.
This conversational quality within the music is what makes it require finesse to play and practice. “[This piece] has many challenges…. We’re just scratching the surface,” Gardiner said. Due to the piece’s difficulty, the HRO members who participated in the performance had rehearsed three times with Gardiner prior to Sunday’s open rehearsal. The members expressed the opinion that the collaboration between Gardiner and HRO was a transformative and informative event for those involved. “It was definitely a very special experience. Having the opportunity to work with one of the world’s leading musicians is something not easy to find,” Zhang says.
For Zhang, the open rehearsal meant more than just the opportunity to work with a renowned conductor like Gardiner. “These bits of information [about Mozart’s composition] are pretty rare to find, even in program notes.… These details definitely enhance the experience a lot,” he says. And as Gardiner and Levin had planned at the beginning of the concert, the concert eventually achieved its plan to encourage performers and audience members to question and think about playing Mozart.

The album artwork on “I Love You, Honeybear,” the newest release by Father John Misty is trippy, to say the least. Showcasing a multicolored nativity scene in what appears to be an abstract jungle, the cover art is not exactly what one may expect from an album of love songs. Then again, “I Love You, Honeybear,” is unexpected in many ways—from its format as a concept album to its display of an as-of-yet unseen side of Joshua Tillman, the man otherwise known as indie-folk-rocker Father John Misty.“I Love You, Honeybear,” Tillman’s second studio album as FJM, listens like an open, enchanted, and quickly disillusioned love letter to his wife.
For the most part, “I Love You, Honeybear” presents a genuine and vulnerable Tillman. Gone are the upbeat rhythms and thick instrumentation of “Fear Fun,” his first LP as Father John Misty. Instead, the listener is left with Tillman’s unbroken vocals supported by subtle drum and guitar lines. While “I Love You, Honeybear” tugs at the heartstrings,  it’s hard to believe the album is anything but sincere after listening to Tillman’s pained and impassioned singing,
Like any love letter (and any album with the word “Honeybear” in its title), “I Love You, Honeybear” runs the risk of sounding sappy, and at times Misty does resort to platitudes. His repeated crooning of “I love you” in the album’s first track turns a bit mawkish, and lines like, “Oh my God, I swear this never happens” on “The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment” sound trite.
But certain tracks display Misty’s emotion with brutal honesty and abandon all the love letter euphemisms and mushiness that make songs like “The Night Josh Tillman Came to Our Apartment” almost forgettable. In “Nothing Good Ever Happens at the Goddamn Thirsty Crow,”he proudly declares that his lover “gets down more often than a blow-up doll.” The artist couples his odd braggadocio with sentiments like, “I just love the kind of woman who can walk all over a man,” which show Misty at his happiest and most exposed. Vulgar or helpless as they make Tillman seem, these lyrics create a sense of authenticity that saves “I Love You, Honeybear” from the doom of cliché.
Musically, the album’s vocals are by far its greatest strength. It’s impossible to get tired of Tillman’s smooth voice, and this LP aptly showcases his wistful singing. “I Love You, Honeybear” contains both moments when his tenor trembles softly, as on the touching “True Affection,” and moments when it cracks with passion, as on the fervent “The Ideal Husband,” making this the kind of album that can easily be listened to three times in a row. Though the instrumentation on “I Love You, Honeybear” certainly does not have as strong of a presence as it did on Tillman’s previous album, the simple guitars and percussion effectively fade into the background, allowing for a more prominent and purposeful expression of his voice.
All enchanted love affairs must come to an end, however, and Father John Misty’s is no exception. The album devolves beautifully into Misty’s disillusionment with American consumerism and corporate culture, which he blames for destroying the simplicity of his passion. In “Bored in the USA,”the album’s lead single, he sneers at a “subprime loan/ On a craftsman home”—the kind of sardonic political statement that makes the album much more than just another collection of love songs. Despite his disillusionment, he keeps hoping for a return to simpler times: “Let’s buy a plantation house and let the yard grow wild,” he begs in “I Went to the Store One Day.” And with that, “I Love You, Honeybear” defines itself as a complex and moving concept album, one that provides a glimpse into the mind of a Father John Misty who is more lovestruck and dissatisfied than ever before.

The Supreme Court’s refusal to prevent Alabama from having to recognize same-sex marriages on Monday led to serious confusion at county courthouses around the state, and briefly thrust to the fore a constitutional dilemma that will likely be resolved this summer. Aside from presenting unique jurisdictional issues for lawyers to address, the situation in Alabama has underscored why political considerations about the readiness of the country for major social changes have had far too much influence on the constitutional debate over same-sex marriage.
The reason the fight over gay marriage has entered a confusing, possibly final stage is directly related to the Supreme Court’s unwillingness to wade fully into the debate. In 2013, the Court ruled the federal Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, but avoided addressing the constitutionality of state gay marriage bans. Last year, it had a chance to take a case to decide that very issue, but did not, because no federal circuit courts had upheld the bans. Shortly thereafter, the Sixth Circuit did just that, forcing the Supreme Court to take the case now before it. All of which brings up the question: Why was the Court so cautious in dealing with same-sex marriage?
Ostensibly, this caution came from historical experience. To take the most prominent example, former women’s rights lawyer and liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has often noted that she thinks Roe v. Wade—the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that enshrined a constitutional right to abortion—was decided “too far, too fast.” Based on her analysis, the Court should have left the country to work out the abortion issue democratically, and by doing otherwise the justices provoked a backlash that has continued to the present.
As lawyer and journalist Lincoln Caplan points out in the New York Times, however, Ginsburg’s reasoning is simply wrong. In their book “Before Roe v. Wade,” Linda Greenhouse and Reva Siegel argue convincingly that abortion politics had already become contentious in the 1970s, spurred on by the Catholic Church, Richard Nixon’s opportunistic strategists, and liberalizing laws in states like New York. Given the razor’s edge on which abortion rights stood at the time, the idea that a decisive decision like Roe would necessarily was the sole provocation of a backlash is unlikely. In short, Roe v. Wade is less a tale of why courts should be cautious, and more an argument in favor of a judiciary willing to lead on issues of fundamental rights, even when public opinion is unclear.
Other historical examples, arguably more analogous to the current battles over same-sex marriage, lead to a similar conclusion. In 1968, the year after the Supreme Court legalized interracial marriage in Loving v. Virginia, Gallup found that fewer than 20 percent of Americans supported marriage between blacks and whites. Now, 87 percent do. If the Supreme Court had waited until the public mood had fully evolved, it might have still been in a constitutional and moral holding pattern until the mid-nineties.
Just as support for interracial marriage rose in the aftermath of Loving, gay marriage in Massachusetts is now quite popular, with 60 percent of residents approving. Here, however, the exact historical pattern is a bit more complicated. Before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court became the first court to rule that a refusal to recognize same-sex marriages violated a state constitution, a Boston Globe poll found that 48 percent of residents supported legalizing gay marriage, and 43 percent opposed it.
In the immediate aftermath of the SJC’s 2003 decision, support dropped to 35 percent, and opposition rose to 53 percent. At first, these statistics would suggest that the SJC’s pro-gay marriage ruling caused the backlash predicted by Ginsburg. But today, of course, a Massachusetts resident opposed to gay marriage might as well be a Yankees fan or someone yelling, “J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets!” in Gillette Stadium. Why, then, the precipitous drop in support during the months after the case?
Politics.
Massachusetts lawmakers briefly considered passing a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and bickered over how to implement the SJC’s ruling, while the Catholic Church made its usual mischief and caused a temporary spike in the number of its members opposed to gay marriages.
Eventually, however, the Commonwealth granted same-sex couples full civil rights as the Court’s decision required, and it—along with much of the country—has yet to look back.
For the current Supreme Court, then, the lessons of history are clear. Contentious social issues will always bring with them political polarization, whether at the hands Nixonian operatives in 1972, segregationists in 1968, or religious activists in 2004. The courts, however, have the ability to throw the status quo firmly behind those fighting for a more just and equitable society.
Having already delayed on gay marriage, the Court is finally set to end the confusion that reigns in places like Alabama. Given waited for public opinion to evolve, and the now widespread support for same-sex marriage around the country, the justices have little excuse for offering anything but a wholehearted endorsement of marriage equality.

Some days it feels like a lie, this thing I tell myself: that queerness, however it has come to me, through conditioning or some movement of the blood, through a violin in another room or an errant DNA sequence, is worth it.
Some days it feels like a liability. To shuffle around gender pronouns. To scan a space mentally before I enter it. To wonder: Who will hate me? Who will say they don’t hate me but tell a joke that makes me feel like I should not exist in the world?
Some days it feels like a superpower. I get to love, I tell myself. I get to love in so many directions. I get to feel pleasure. I get to live a thing I did not know was possible, as Adrienne Rich says, “as a succession of brief, amazing movements”—slowly, miraculously—“each one making possible the next.”
They never tell us sex with someone of our gender is possible.
The knowledge was epiphanic. If this could be, what else? 15, summer sweat slicking down my June thighs, breasts taut. I was hanging out with a girl a couple of years older than me. Her car smelled like sandalwood. On rainy days we smoked pot in the garden shed.
Swimming in our sports bras, summer just coming on, she said she’d had sex with a female friend.
I went hot and cold with a thing I did not know was excitement.
They—TV and Seventeen and grownups—never tell us we can love like that. It’s this big secret they’ve always kept. I don’t remember knowing one out gay person growing up—or if I did, no one thought especially to tell me.
Most of my peers and their parents were explicitly homophobic. My immediate family was not. But there’s a difference between accepting queer people and working hard, constantly, to counter the overwhelming socialization that to be queer is bad or different: One family can’t fix an entire culture’s worth of signalling. It seemed the kind of life I wanted was the kind of life one couldn’t have.
I never knew I’d get all this pleasure. I never knew it could be this good. Bed on Sunday mornings, hazy parties, kissing on subway platforms, holding friends’ hands. This isn’t the only way to be queer; embracing traditional forms of family, community, and belonging are no less valid and dignified choices. But we need to establish the preconditions for there to be choice in the first place.
We have a right to pleasure. To different kinds of pleasure. To dinner, to caring for one’s children, to making love, to halving a stick of gum with a friend on the bus. The great potential of the queer movement is not in normalization—in making white picket fences for white picket people while exploitative systems go on—but possibility. Of expanding the ways that humans can relate to one another; of harnessing creativity to promote more just economic systems, to reimagine governmental paradigms, to expand our cultural conceptions of love. Oppression forces us into the daily defensive of not enough resources. It makes us ungenerous. It shuts us off. To enable creative dexterity, we need to fight not only homophobia, but the material and ideological conditions that limit human imagination.
Because lots of queers—lots of people—don’t get the kind of living that aches like honey: a wild, ragged sweetness on the tongue. There are structural reasons why I’m allowed so very much safety, though sometimes uncomfortably, to create and dance and eat and love: I’m from an upper-middle class, left-leaning family; I have incredible educational privilege; I’m white in the contemporary U.S.
Fundamental to the queer movement then—fundamental to enabling us to experience and channel the complexity I felt at fifteen—is a project of socioeconomic and racial justice, of gender justice, of the universal procurement of adequate material, cultural, and psychological resources. We as a movement have an obligation to work towards the conditions that enable, as Martha Nussbaum puts it, “human thriving.”
We did make out once. Me and that girl. Mid-May, prom day, but I was too young to go. She was home on break from college and we kissed in her room. I didn’t know whether it meant I was loved utterly or hated. I was too nervous to be aroused; when I was alone, much later, I wept. “You will go to college before you know it,” she said of my too-big-for-that-place brain encased in my too-ethnic-for-that-place bone structure, “and there will be men who want you.” This was confusing: I wanted men, certainly, but at that moment I was boozy with wanting her. Her words said it was impossible; her words said I could not exist.
Afterward, we went to a greenhouse. I cannot communicate the stupid, symbolically overburdened irony. The hothouse light, the tomatoes just begun their overburgeoning. And I could no more say it than I could—outside the charmed few hours—touch her, but the kisses had left new words on my tongue.

On Tuesday, gunshots were heard a little after 5:00 p.m. in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and the gruesome tragedy was soon known: Deah Shaddy Barakat, a 23-year-old dental student, his 21-year-old wife of six weeks, Yusor Mohammad, and her 19-year-old sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha were shot in the head, executed by their neighbor in their own home and in their own country.
Since the murder of the three Muslim students of Arab descent three days ago, America’s Muslims have been left reeling.
I wish I could write that it isn’t just America’s Muslims who are suffering, that it is America, as one nation, mourning these three stolen souls. But I can't bring myself to write that.
Perhaps it’s harder to think clearly when tragedy strikes your community. Perhaps it becomes too easy to convince yourself of discrimination and prejudice when two women who wear hijabs like your mother and sisters do are gunned down.
But those comparisons come, and the “what if"s and “why not”s overwhelm you.
You wonder whether the media would have covered this sooner if the attackers, rather than the victims, were Muslim. You wonder where the word “terrorism” has gone when the people with whom you share a religion and culture are the ones being terrorized.
You wonder whether the police and district attorney would have labeled the massacre “an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking” and an “isolated incident” that was “not part of a targeted campaign” if it weren’t young Muslims who had been killed.
You wonder whether we would have so quickly accepted that the killer were clearly deranged if he spoke Arabic instead of English. You wonder where all those calls for the moderates to stand up and denigrate violence went.
To me, it’s impossible that shooting three Muslims in the head could have been the sole result of a parking dispute. It’s impossible for me to dismiss as these murders as that, or as a mere “isolated incident,” in the same way that the black community couldn’t, wouldn’t, and will not dismiss Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, or Eric Garner as “isolated incidents” of police brutality.
Instead, everything about the killings, from their very execution to the sluggish reporting that followed them, seems under the shadow of the festering anti-Muslim sentiments that some politicians and pundits have spoken, while the others let their ugly assertions go unchallenged. It’s a noxious system of thought that allows people to see their Muslims as subhuman, people who can be killed and easily discarded en masse over a parking dispute.
Because in our haste to conflate Islamism with everyday Muslims, we have subtly and subconsciously grafted the images of the extreme fringe onto an entire people. When people like Bill Maher ask moderate Muslims to condemn the attack on Charlie Hebdo, there is an implication that all Muslims carry a default liking of bloodshed, one that must be publicly disavowed to be considered a member of civilization.
Here, a host on the nation’s most watched cable news channel can go on a seven-minute rant saying, “We need to kill them. We need to kill them. The radical Muslim terrorists hell bent on killing us,” without any repercussions.
Here, calling the president a “secret Muslim” is a slur to some, as if Islam and patriotism are entirely antithetical.
Just a month before the Chapel Hill killings, nearby Duke University canceled plans to allow the Muslim call to prayer to be sounded from the school’s chapel, after fierce criticism. “To use the bell tower as a minaret, to call on the god of Islam, we as Christians are being marginalized,” said the evangelist Franklin Graham. Most of the services conducted inside the chapel of the Methodist-founded university are Christian.
At the time, Omid Safi, a professor and director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center, expressed his disappointment, saying, “We are essentially caving into the very real security concerns.”
“This is, in all of the heartbreak and violence and sadness, where we are,” he said one month later.
I can’t say for certain that our tolerance for anti-Muslim bigotry caused these senseless deaths—but neither can I say that it didn’t. And that’s what troubles me the most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the face of Divest Harvard’s sit-in at Massachusetts Hall, which was still ongoing at press time, not only does our opposition to the fossil fuel divestment movement remain strong, but we also condemn the group's latest protest methods. As we have opined many times in the past, while anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest problems of our time, divestment would not change the calculus of the energy industry.
Fossil fuels represent only about 0.2 percent of Harvard’s $36.4 billion portfolio, and Harvard’s largest investment in a fossil fuel company, Anadarko Petroleum, clocks in at near 0.1 percent of that company’s value. To assert that divestment would generate public pressure against these companies seems naive. After all, the 2010 British Petroleum oil spill created an enormous amount of bad publicity for the company, but it still posted $5.3 billion in profits the next year. It is unlikely fossil fuel companies will abandon their entire businesses when global oil demand only looks to rise. These oil companies—precisely those that Divest Harvard wishes to be rid of—have indeed historically undertaken some of the first and largest investments in renewable energy. Considering we as a community rely on fossil fuels to power our laptops, the T, the airplanes we fly to Boston, and the trucks that bring fresh food to the dining halls, divestment at Harvard seems both impractical and hypocritical.
Harvard’s place is to be a university: an institution of teaching, learning, research, and collaboration. As such, numerous existing Harvard programs seek to generate new solutions to climate change. However, Divest Harvard’s latest tactics—from the videotaping of University President Drew G. Faust to yesterday’s sit-in—only prevent open discussion and impede Harvard’s important educational and social mission.  They sideline the debate and distract from the real goal of combating global warming. As we have opined in the past, other student groups like I, Too, Am Harvard and Our Harvard Can Do Better have effected change without disrupting University operations.
Past meetings with President Faust, representatives of the Harvard Management Company, the Board of Overseers, and the Harvard Corporation have afforded Divest Harvard an unusual degree of access to the administration. Yesterday’s offer of yet another meeting between President Faust and Divest leaders stands in contrast to the Undergraduate Council’s single closed meeting with Faust each semester. The offer of a closed meeting without any media or recording devices present is generous; students should not expect continued audiences with the administration, especially in light of Faust’s October 2013 open letter that clearly articulated her anti-divestment stance. Indeed, even despite the University’s objections to divestment, Harvard Management Company has added a vice president of sustainability.
We believe that Divest Harvard’s radical protest actions have no logical end, especially since Faust’s stance is so clear. Were Faust to agree to an open meeting but still refuse to divest, then what? Given the Faust’s previous experience with the video confrontation, where her words were spoken over and the full conversation edited, the University’s reticence to agree to an open meeting is understandable. Tactics like the sit-in or blockade are merely self-promotion, not reasonable attempts to change minds on this critical issue. In fact, they seem far more likely to alienate potential supporters than to draw them in.
Disrupting University business is not open debate, it is not free speech, and it is not a productive way to move forward on this desperately critical issue. Harvard deserves better, and so does the environment.

A committee tasked with reviewing the Program in General Education will issue an interim report on the program for faculty comment next week.
“It’s a very short draft,” said Gen Ed review committee chair Sean D. Kelly, who is also chair of the Philosophy department. “It contains an account of the information that we’ve gathered from the various constituencies that we’ve been talking with,” including undergraduates, teaching fellows, faculty members, and administrators.
The current program—both the courses offered and the way those classes are taught—leaves undergraduates, professors, and administrators dissatisfied, according to Kelly.
“I don’t think anybody thinks that the program is in fabulous shape, but the question is...what’s the diagnosis,” said Edward J. Hall, the Committee on Gen Ed’s faculty chair and a Philosophy professor.
Last fall, the Gen Ed review committee convened town hall meetings to solicit feedback on the program from College students, graduate students, and faculty members. Attendees raised concerns about topics ranging from Gen Ed course difficulty levels to challenges in teaching students with different academic experience levels.
The interim report is a precursor for a final document that the review committee will release later this spring. The committee will release the interim report, which will detail ideas for the program, internally to faculty members, according to Kelly. He declined to name specific proposals included in the report, citing a desire to hear feedback from faculty first.
From the beginning of their review of the program, committee members looked at Gen Ed’s eight course categories, Kelly said, and they are considering how those categories align with what administrators outline as Gen Ed’s philosophical mission.
The Gen Ed philosophy, as it was intended when the program was conceived, centers around giving undergraduates the tools “to think seriously about their education, about the way in which their education prepares them for, among other things, civic life in a sort of global society,” Kelly said. “It’s not obvious that the categories clearly manifest the philosophical goals of the program.”
In addition to evaluating the categories, committee members may consider changing the number of Gen Ed requirements that students must fulfill.
“Eight is an awful lot, I think,” Kelly said. “I am not opposed to the thought that maybe there will be fewer required General Education courses.”
The feedback the committee heard from students and faculty members highlighted a variety of other issues related to the current Gen Ed program, according to Kelly. When selecting Gen Ed courses, undergraduates tend to choose courses with lower difficulty ratings and pay more attention to the overall Q score, Kelly said. “These metrics aren’t so prominent when students are choosing other courses,” he said.
From the standpoint of professors and teaching fellows, Gen Ed courses often do not fit into specialized faculty members’ areas of expertise. Instructors also have to teach the material to students with different levels of experience in the subject, according to Kelly.
“[Instructors] have everything from first-year freshmen, who have no background in any area related to the Gen Ed course, to second-semester seniors, who have a lot of detailed background in things sometimes covered by the course,” Hall said.

UPDATED: February 13, 2015, at 12:57 a.m.
During a flu season that has seen nationally elevated levels of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths, Harvard University Health Services has administered over 15,000 flu vaccinations since August with over 2,700 vaccinations completed for College students, according to a UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.
UHS purchased vaccines during the summer and has administered them in general flu clinics since September. These weekly student clinics were held at the Smith Campus Center and in dining halls through the end of December. One final clinic occurred on February 2.
Prior to flu season, various groups, including the World Health Organization and the Food and Drug Administration, collect data to predict which flu strains will be most prevalent in the upcoming year and should therefore be used in the vaccine.
According to Barry R. Bloom, professor at the School of Public Health, this year’s flu season has been particularly severe because the vaccine does not provide effective protection against some H3N2 strains of virus. According to Bloom, the other three strains in the vaccine were accurately predicted. However, the lack of protection for some other strains has led to high flu activity, he said.
UHS has reported only a small number of students and community members falling ill with the flu, the majority of whom had not yet been vaccinated.
Some students, however, report coming down with the flu even after having been vaccinated at UHS. Nick P. Heath ’18 was vaccinated in September during a routine physical exam which was required in order to walk onto the men’s lightweight crew team. Despite getting vaccinated, he contracted the virus near the end of the fall semester.
“Overall I have a good immune system and haven't been that sick in a few years,” Heath said.
Despite the absence of some strains in the current vaccine, Bloom recommends getting inoculated, as the vaccine can be effective against certain strains of the virus. In particular, he recommends the vaccine for children and elderly people, populations that are the most susceptible to the flu.

The National Association of the Deaf filed lawsuits Thursday against Harvard and MIT alleging that they had discriminated against deaf and hard of hearing individuals by not providing captioning for their online content.
The complaint against Harvard alleges that the University has “largely denied access to this content to the approximately 48 million—nearly one out of five—Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing.” According to the complaint, a significant amount of Harvard’s online content does not provide proper captioning and is thus inaccessible to individuals with hearing impairments.
The complaint against Harvard cites YouTube videos, podcasts, and in particular MOOCs available through the online learning platform edX as examples of the “thousands of videos and audio tracks publicly available for free to anyone.” EdX, a non-profit digital learning platform founded by Harvard and MIT, offers courses that are free and open to the public, but without captions, the complaint says.
“Harvard and MIT are leaders in the movement among universities to put a lot of content online,” said Bill Lann Lee, one of the lawyers representing the NAD in the suits. “The objective of the National Association of the Deaf is to make sure that, with respect to this burgeoning area of education...deaf people not be left out.”
The suits came after repeated requests made by the NAD to the University to provide accurate captioning, according to the complaint. Harvard is “fully aware that captioning is necessary” for its online content to be equally accessible, the complaint says.
The complaints against both MIT and Harvard claim that the universities have violated the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The first act requires that places of public accommodation “not deny persons with disabilities” its services, and the second stipulates that education institutions receiving federal financial assistance must provide equal access to all individuals regardless of disabilities.
“Harvard and MIT are covered institutions [under these acts] because they both receive hundreds of millions of dollars in federal support,” Lee said. “The online content and services that the universities provide is for the public as well as the students...I really don’t think there’s really any doubt that these laws apply to Harvard and MIT.”
Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the University, declined to comment on the lawsuit in an email. He did, however, write that Harvard expects that the U.S. Department of Justice will issue proposed rules in June to provide “much needed guidance in this area” and that the University will “fully comply” with these rules.
Christine M. Griffin, executive director of the Disability Law Center in Boston, said she thinks Harvard and MIT have the resources to reform their content and set an example in accessible content for other universities.
“They’re two very large, well-known institutions nationally and internationally that certainly have the ability and the money to get this done,” she said.

An online town hall forum and a celebrity launch event are among the many avenues that the Undergraduate Council plans to take as part of its “Harvard HeForShe” gender equality initiative this semester.
The project, spearheaded by Mather House representative Michelle S. Lee ’16, aims to consolidate voices of various gender student groups on campus, as well as engage more male figures in the discussion of universal empowerment. “Harvard HeForShe” is an extension of the United Nations’ HeForShe worldwide gender campaign, which formally began last September.
Shortly after, Lee began work on the College-specific extension of the campaign and has worked with other Council representatives since the beginning of the spring semester to involve various student groups in the project.
“We are currently reaching out to student groups to ask what gender equality looks like in their respective spaces,” Lee said. “We especially hope to reach those groups who may not traditionally participate in a ‘women’s rights’ movement.”
Lee plans to hold a formal celebrity launch event for “Harvard HeForShe” through the Institute of Politics later this spring. Once the campaign is launched, the Council hopes to sustain it by partnering with the Harvard Business School to deliver an online town hall forum to students.
“Ultimately, we want people to become more conscientious about these issues in their daily lives,” Lee said. Lee also added that the inspiration to start the campaign also sprung from “unbalanced gender ratios” within the Council itself. After last September's election, the Council had its greatest gender imbalance in four years.
According to former and current Council members, the UC is a prime organization to lead the HeForShe campaign because of its access and relevance to all students at the College.
“As far as rallying the entire undergraduate community behind a movement, it’s something that nothing but the UC can contribute,” said former UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15. “Having the UC help carry that momentum forward, it’s really an exciting thing.”
In an interview earlier this semester, UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said that they prefer to focus on “deliverability”of projects such as “Harvard HeForShe” and a proposed Harvard phone application package in lieu of negotiating with administrators.
“I believe that the issues tackled by Harvard HeforShe and the app package are valuable in that they are student-driven and directly affect student life,” Lee said. “If students are paying activities fees for the year, then they deserve to see projects improving student life roll out in that same year.”

Winthrop affiliates expressed excitement on Thursday about the additional space and updates to housing promised by preliminary plans for Winthrop House renewal.
Plans released on Wednesday revealed that Harvard will construct a five-story addition to Gore Hall called “Winthrop East” in addition to general renovations that will occur in 2016-2017 as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project. The addition will provide more student housing and social spaces for Winthrop residents.
Like other Winthrop students, DJ J. Badillo ’16 said he was glad Harvard will be improving what he called the “infamously well-known poor housing situation we’re in.”
Winthrop, originally built for 291 students, currently houses 355 undergraduates, according to Merle Bicknell, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences assistant dean for physical resources.
Winthrop House Committee Co-Chairs Marlee A. Ehrlich ’16 and Andrew I. Wyner ’16, who currently participate in a student feedback committee regarding the House renewal, both said that they thought this addition would serve to bring Winthrop students closer together.
Kevin Bu ’15, a Winthrop resident who lived in DeWolfe as a sophomore, said that he spent the majority of his time at Quincy House while living in DeWolfe.
“I didn’t really feel like part of the [Winthrop] House community,” Bu said. “I feel like geography has a really big impact.”
Bu also said he was looking forward to the additional social spaces in Winthrop East, calling the current process of booking Winthrop’s common rooms “competitive.” Other students said they would like to see a grill or more music rooms in Winthrop.
While most were enthusiastic about the programming possibilities Winthrop East presented, some said they had reservations about its architecture. In preliminary renderings, the addition features a contemporary design, a departure from Winthrop’s neo-Georgian style.
Badillo said he was worried that among the River Houses’ traditional-style buildings, Winthrop East will look “a little weird.”
However, Ehrlich said that while she had also been initially skeptical, she now believes the design will update Winthrop’s style to “keep it fresh” while preserving important elements.
House Masters Ronald S. Sullivan and Stephanie Robinson said that they had been involved in Winthrop renewal plans from the beginning, and were overall very pleased with the preliminary renewal plans.
They also said that they welcomed the relocation of the House Master’s residence, which is currently a repurposed group of dorms.
“We have now the unique opportunity to ‘purpose-build’ a master’s residence that can serve the need of Winthrop students,” Sullivan said. “We’ll have dedicated space for all of the various events that the masters hold.”
Both said they were committed to communicating with students and involving them in the renewal process.
“I’m just really happy that the House masters are opening this up to the House” Ehrlich said. “It’s exciting that it feels like a collaboration.”

Following its inaugural pilot program, which was accessible to Massachusetts undergraduates, and its subsequent expansion to six corporate clients, HBX—Harvard Business School’s digital learning platform—will begin releasing its online set of introductory courses to undergraduates and post-graduates worldwide at the end of the month.
Any college student and those who have been out of college for up to nine years will have the opportunity to apply for the upcoming iteration of the Credential of Readiness (CORe) program, according to Bharat N. Anand ’88, HBX faculty chair.
Consisting of three courses on accounting, analytics, and management economics, CORe enrolled 600 Massachusetts undergraduates when first launched during the summer of 2014 and attracted about 450 more students that fall, Anand said. Despite the fact that the February iteration will begin during the school year for most students, he said he still expects as many as 1,000 enrollees.
“We realized that there might be a market much broader than MBA students,” Anand said. “Our focus is undergraduates and post-graduates—people who are thinking about business as a career, or who want to start a business, or who want to have the confidence to enter the workforce, or even who want to switch careers.”
The CORe program will still have an application process and will require tuition fees from those who enroll.  According to Regina E. Herzlinger, a Business School professor and edX course instructor, while those accepted to CORe will be eligible for financial aid, the courses offered on HBX must be paid so that the platform can be sustainable.
“There’s no way these courses will be free. The faculty is paid, the editors are paid, the photographers are paid, the administrator staff is paid; there has to be some source of those revenues,” she said. “To enable offering financial aid and to support the costs of developing these programs, something has got to give.”
According to Anand, the program is not intended to substitute for an MBA but rather to allow those with a liberal arts education to supplement their degree with a primer in basic business skills. Despite the pre-MBA aspect of the program, he said that the “Credential of Readiness” received by enrollees who finish the $1,500 eleven-week program can be very valuable to employers.
According to Janice H. Hammond, a Business School professor who teaches one of the three CORe courses, the program will attempt to replicate key features of HBS pedagogy online in the program. To adapt “cold calling” to the HBX platform, she said that students will be randomly chosen to receive a digital “cold call” and give a text response in under two minutes.

Thanks to research by Lee Gehrke, a professor of health sciences and technology, and other researchers at Harvard and MIT, viruses like Ebola may be more rapidly detected and tracked than ever before. The rapid diagnostic, which can detect deadly pathogens in under 30 minutes, is part of an interdisciplinary project supported by the National Institutes of Health.
This invention has grown out years of research at Gehrke’s lab on RNA viruses, viruses that have one-stranded RNA rather than DNA as their genome. Ebola is an example of an RNA virus. The researchers are pairing the rapid diagnostic with a phone application to allow the spread of the viruses to be tracked via real-time maps.
30 MINUTES OR LESS
Gehrke said that the goal of the researchers was to develop a rapid diagnostic test that can perform in under 30 minutes and can be used as a point-of-care device to evaluate patients with fevers, which can indicate many different underlying diseases.
“If a patient comes into a clinic and has a fever, you want to be able to rule out some pathogens,” he said. “In West Africa, there are a number of viruses that would present as fever, including Ebola, Lassa, and Marburg, so it is very useful to get a very quick idea of what the patient is suffering from.”
While the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has ascended to international media headlines in recent months, Gehrke warned against ignoring other dangerous viruses.
“Ebola is a terrible disease, but it is not the only one that I think we should be prepared for,” Gehrke added. “There are other emerging viruses that we also need to have a great sense of preparedness for.”
The device is specific for several viruses, including Ebola and dengue fever, and it can detect more than one pathogen at once, according to Gehrke.
“By detecting whether a person’s fever is in fact a symptom of Ebola, the rapid diagnostic can help better quarantine people,” said Kimberly Hamad-Schifferli, MIT professor and senior collaborator on this project.
Gehrke also attested to the value of rapid detection of the virus.
“Being able to detect the virus and identify the people or environments that are contaminated is very important for reducing or stopping the spread. Early detection is important for treatment,” he said.
NUTS AND BOLTS
Unlike other diagnostic tools, the Harvard and MIT-developed device can be operated cheaply by personnel with little training in a variety of settings. Competing approaches, like polymerase chain reaction, require more time and expensive equipment.
“This approach gives much greater flexibility, cost control, and adaptability in responding to outbreaks of different emerging pathogens in different parts of the world,” Gehrke wrote in an email.
Gehrke attributed this flexibility in part to the ability of the device to operate without power or refrigeration. The device does not require specialized chemicals, equipment, or training, researchers said.
“We are interested in making something that can detect disease rapidly and can be operated by an end user, or someone who is not medically trained or a technician,” Hamad-Schifferli said.
The device uses a sample of a body fluid, such as blood, serum, or saliva, to test a patient, Gehrke said. The test operates by diverting the sample in a maze-like structure and making it run into chemicals, said José Gómez-Márquez, director of the Little Devices Lab at MIT and senior collaborator on this research.
According to MIT postdoctoral fellow Justina Tam, who is working on visual markers, or detection agents, for the rapid diagnostic, “the detection agents are agents that have some visible color if they accumulate in a certain area of the test, which means a protein for a specific virus is present in the sample.”
Not only does this visible color indicate whether a patient is infected with a virus, but it also reveals the virus’s specific strain.
REAL-TIME RESULTS
According to Gómez-Márquez, aggregating the results of the rapid diagnostic through an accompanying phone app allows researchers to track the spread of viruses in real-time, which he hopes will prevent their spread in the future.
He called the device a crowdsource diagnostic because it relies on many users to send images of their results via the phone app. The diagnostic itself gives a result, but the phone app quantifies it and measures the location of the infectious diseases so that the spread of viruses can be tracked rapidly, Gómez-Márquez said.
“If we can do that for hundreds of patients, then we can get a real-time map of the spread of the disease,” he added.
He said that up to now, maps of the spread of viruses include information of what occurred in the past, based on death records and hospital records that are weeks old. The new technology gives health providers a better understanding of the path viruses could take in the future.
“In public health, we don’t have real-time maps for epidemiology, but that’s important for saving the next lives.The prevailing attitude is looking at the past, which doesn’t allow us to help the future,” he said.
According to Gómez-Márquez, several people are working on the phone app for different platforms, including the Android phone.
According to JN Fang ’16, who is working on an Android version of the app, health workers administering the diagnostic will be able to use the app to read and aggregate the results of the test. The app can determine “if...the change in test strips is enough of a change to indicate that the patient has tested positive for either of the four strains of dengue fever or Ebola,” she said.
After testing the diagnostic in the laboratory, Gehrke said his lab is currently field-testing the device. According to Gehrke, the commercial launch of the device will depend on the regulatory process for approval by the FDA.
This rapid diagnostic will be another tool among “a number of different methods [that] are going to be necessary for detecting and hopefully stopping this virus and other infectious viruses,” Gehrke said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2015, at 12:27 p.m.
Twenty Harvard Law School professors who had publicly spoken out against Harvard’s University-wide sexual harassment policy submitted a memo last fall requesting that the Law School investigate its own sexual harassment cases, rather than go through Harvard’s central investigation office.
The 20 faculty members submitted the memo, dated Nov. 11, 2014, to a faculty committee that Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow tasked last fall with creating new Law School-specific Title IX procedures following widespread faculty discontent over Harvard’s central framework, which administrators unveiled last summer.
The document, parts of which signatory and Law School professor Elizabeth Bartholet shared with The Crimson this week, sheds light on the process that led to the adoption of the local procedures that, if implemented, in many respects will circumvent Harvard’s newly centralized approach to handling sexual misconduct.
Several of the principles that the professors laid out in the memo, though not all, mirror elements of the Law School’s new Title IX procedures, which have not yet been fully implemented but were approved by the faculty in December. In particular, the memo requested that the Law School provide complainants and respondents with attorneys, a provision that is included in the Law School's new procedures.
Law School professor John Coates, who chaired the committee that wrote the school’s new procedures, confirmed in an email that the committee considered the memo’s principles when it drafted the procedures.
The procedures that the Law School faculty voted to adopt in December—and that the November memo sought to influence—were created after 28 professors signed an open letter in October in The Boston Globe criticizing Harvard’s new policy and procedures, which created the central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution. The professors argued that the central policy and procedures were biased against the accused and lacked due process.
All 20 signatories of the Nov. 11 memo, which the professors also shared with Minow and the full Law School faculty, were signatories of the open letter in the Globe.
Some of the Globe letter’s signatories have already voiced their approval for the Law School’s new procedures, and the November memo confirms that many of those signatories actively lobbied for specific procedural changes.
Specifically, the memo makes clear that its authors did not want the Law School to follow Harvard’s central procedures, which sought to make Harvard’s approach to handling sexual harassment consistent across all of its schools. Specifically, the memo states that “No aspect of proceeding should be allocated to new ODR office. HLS should retain responsibility for investigation, adjudication, appeal, and sanction.”
Still, not every demand laid out in the memo matches the recently adopted procedures, nor is every request in the memo unanimous; the memo indicates that some sections represented the opinions of “most” or “some,” but not all, of its authors. Signatories were in disagreement, for example, about the role the full faculty should play in reviewing expulsions and dismissal decisions as well as the appeals process.
Some parts of the memo that Bartholet said are related to internal faculty affairs were redacted before she shared it with The Crimson. She said in an interview that she “felt that it was really important to take advantage of this separate space the Law School had been given to come up with sexual harassment policies.”
Both Bartholet and signatory and Law professor Janet E. Halley said the November memo was the only such memo on the procedures circulated among the full faculty.
Minow declined to comment.
In addition to Bartholet and Halley, the Law professors who signed the November memo include:
Scott Brewer, Robert C. Clark, Charles J. Donahue ’62, Einer R. Elhauge ’83, Martha A. Field ’66, Jesse M. Fried, Nancy Gertner, Bruce L. Hay, Philip B. Heymann, David W. Kennedy, Duncan Kennedy, Robert H. Mnookin ’64, Charles J. Ogletree, Richard D. Parker, J. Mark Ramseyer, David Rosenberg, Lewis D. Sargentich, and Jeannie C. Suk.
Amid controversy over Harvard’s policy governing its handling of sexual harassment, the federal government found the Law School in violation of the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX in December.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After administrators increased its funding and more than doubled its staff, Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response has experienced heavy demand for its now-expanded services, leaving the office stretched to full capacity, just as it was last year, according to director Alicia Oeser.
Last spring, amid controversy over Harvard’s handling of sexual assault, University President Drew G. Faust accepted a presidential task force’s recommendations that Harvard increase support for OSAPR, which offers counseling and sexual assault prevention resources. At the time, Steven E. Hyman, a former University provost who chairs the task force, requested that the University provide OSAPR with more resources, arguing that an “understaffed OSAPR risks slow or ineffective responses to students who have experienced sexual assault.”
After receiving an increase in funding, OSAPR has filled three new staff positions since last summer—an administrative assistant, education specialist, and survivor advocate—and designated a prevention specialist, who previously worked part-time, as full-time, according to Oeser.
A key part of the expansion has included increased access for graduate students to OSAPR resources. Christopher M. Gilbert, the prevention specialist, will split his time equally between the College and graduate schools, and recently-hired education specialist Seth Avakian works full time with graduate and professional schools. OSAPR’s second education specialist, Meera Seshadri, will focus on the College, Oeser said.
“By and large we just didn't have the staff to do that,” Oeser said, referring to education resources that have now expanded to Harvard’s graduate schools. “That’s been a really significant change in our capacity.”
Much of the new University education specialist’s time, Oeser said, has been dedicated to developing relationships with affiliates at Harvard’s graduate schools.
But because the introduction of these resources at both the College and University as a whole has been met with an increased demand for OSAPR’s services, Oeser said the office continues to operate at capacity, as it has in the past.
“Resources are a thing that, I think, will always be in demand, and our job is really to do the best with what we have and find ways to actively engage the community,” she added.
Herman K. Bhupal ’16, the vice president of Consent, Assault Awareness, and Relationship Educators, an OSAPR-sponsored student group, said the office’s expanded staff has meant that more assistance is available for students seeking help.
“That’s definitely been helpful...for all student groups that meet with OSAPR,” Bhupal said.
Despite increased outreach efforts to student groups and the recent news that Dartmouth plans to institute four-year sexual assault training programming for its students, Oeser said OSAPR would not institute a similar measure at Harvard without the broad support of students first pushing for the measure.
The administration’s decision to increase funding for OSAPR came as the federal government was investigating Harvard’s Title IX compliance at the Law School and the College. While the Law School investigation has concluded, the probe at the College remains ongoing; Oeser said this week that OSAPR has not been directly involved in either investigation.
Hyman could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The taller you are, the harder you fall.
Such has been the case with the No. 14/13 Harvard men’s ice hockey team over the past two weeks.
After holding down a top-five spot in the Division I rankings for several weeks, the Crimson have strung together three weeks of subpar play, culminating in a loss to conference bottom-feeder Brown last Saturday.
Harvard is now in jeopardy of missing out on a first-round ECAC playoff bye, something that seemed like a certainty at the start of 2015. Sitting on the bubble for a bid to the NCAA Tournament, coach Ted Donato ’91 has three weeks to right the ship before the postseason. But calm waters do not sit in front of the Crimson.
Harvard (12-8-2, 8-6-2 ECAC) will take the ice at the Bright-Landry Center for the first time this month to face Colgate (15-10-3, 7-6-3) on Friday and Cornell (10-10-3, 8-7-1) on Saturday. The Crimson will look to avenge a last-minute loss to the Big Red in January.
“I think we realize we have to get back on the horse here and go back to what we were doing before break,” sophomore Sean Malone said. “We’re positive right now, and we know this is a huge weekend for us.”
This weekend will go a long way to help determine who earns byes in the conference tournament. While ECAC leaders No. 13/14 Quinnipiac and No. 20/- St. Lawrence appear to be locks for first-round byes, there is a contested battle for the remaining two. Four teams—including Harvard —are tied for third, with the Big Red and Raiders sitting one point behind.
Cornell robbed the Crimson of an opportunity to earn at least a point in their matchup in Ithaca on Jan. 23. After a goal from freshman defenseman Eddie Ellis tied the game at two in the third, the teams seemed to be headed to overtime before sophomore Eric Freschi sniped the puck past junior goaltender Steve Michalek with 41 seconds on the scoreboard to give the hosts the late push they needed.
“Cornell is a huge rivalry game,” Malone said. “Usually guys get more pumped up about these types of games than any others. We certainly want to win.”
Senior Cole Bardreau heads the attack for Cornell, ranking in the top 10 in points scored in conference games. The fourth-year member of the Big Red opened the scoring against Harvard at Lynah Rink.
Although Cornell has struggled to generate offense at times, the team has had the most effective power play in conference games this year, converting on 21 percent of opportunities. Harvard ranks just below with a 20 percent conversion rate.
The Big Red also boasts the goaltender with the highest save percentage in the conference, sophomore Mitch Gillam. The second-year star has saved 95 percent of the shots he has faced this season.
The previous matchup with the other team on Harvard’s slate went much differently than the one in Ithaca. After Freschi beat the clock, Harvard rolled into Hamilton and put up its largest rout of the season, earning a comfortable 6-1 victory.
Colgate relies on a balanced attack, starting with junior Kyle Baun and senior Joe Wilson, who lead the Raiders in goals scored in conference play. Baun and Wilson have combined for only 10 strikes in ECAC contests. Harvard junior Jimmy Vesey, meanwhile, has notched 14, two of which came in Hamilton.
The Raiders’ top goaltender, sophomore Charlie Finn, will be out with an upper body injury this weekend.
The weekend slate was made a little easier for the Crimson when the Beanpot consolation game against No. 10/11 Boston College on Monday was postponed to Feb. 23. But even with the week’s reduced schedule, victory will not come easy for the Crimson on Friday.
“Especially with [Cornell and Colgate] being so close in the standings, it’ll be huge if we’re able to get wins and push ahead a little,” Malone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before getting to the basketball, I want to begin this column with a moment of mourning for the three University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill students who were shot Wednesday—Shaddy Barakat, Yusor Mohammad, and Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha. My thoughts and prayers are with the deceased and their families.
With that, let’s return to Ivy League basketball, dear reader.
Last weekend, Harvard swept Brown and Yale by a grand total of four points, further evoking shades of the 2012 team with a gritty win in Payne Whitney to ascend to the top of the Ivy League. The Crimson plays only two of its final eight contests on the road and appear to have senior wing and reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders (24.5 ppg last weekend) in peak form.
Yale travels this weekend to Princeton, who blew a golden chance to separate itself from the league’s middle tier—namely, the Gentleman’s C’s—by giving up a 26-0 run to Cornell. Last year, the Bulldogs roared back from a double-digit halftime lead at home for a one-point overtime win, squashing any hopes Princeton had of making the NCAA Tournament. Two weeks later, the Tigers returned the favor in Jadwin with an 11-point win that put Yale’s title hopes on life support.
Princeton’s precarious position illustrates the danger of the Ivy League, where the conference often becomes a two-horse race after the third or fourth weekend.
No league champion since 1980 has finished with five or more losses. For all the talk about an extremely deep Ivy League, Harvard and Yale have opened up a two-game lead in the win column over the field.
With road sweeps difficult to come by, a team like Princeton will need to be nearly perfect at home the rest of the way and win in at least one at Cambridge and New Haven to have a realistic shot at the title.
A quick exercise in binomial probability can help us see how difficult this is. Even if Princeton—who rates as the fourth-best team in the league, via KenPom—has a 60 percent chance of winning each of its remaining games, it has only a 23 percent chance of finishing 7-2 or better. With extremely optimistic projections, those are tough odds.
CORNELL AT DARTMOUTH
Ah, the first of the Ivy League’s biannual color-fights. This is arguably the league’s least relevant matchup; the Big Red and the Big Green have only finished in the league’s top half in the same year once since 1980. Since John Wall personally squashed Cornell’s 2009 blaze of glory, neither has finished among the Ancient Eight’s top five.
Both teams are frisky this year—Cornell consistently and Dartmouth in spurts. Both have used titanic runs to take out a league elite (Princeton and Harvard, respectively) while failing to come to play consistently. Both have the ignominy of double-digit losses to Penn on their schedule, wounds that cut deep.
But don’t just take that from me. The Friday loss so badly upset the sports writers of the Cornell Daily Sun that they didn’t write about it until Wednesday. If the Big Red lose here, the snow might melt before news gets out.
Pick: Dartmouth
YALE AT PENN
Coming off its first adversity of conference play, Yale should listen to Frank Kaminsky.
No, I am not referring to the Wisconsin center—the droopy-eyed Naismith award candidate and self-proclaimed co-founder of the #DirtyDub. I refer to the “other” Frank Kaminsky—the greatest basketball player in Yale history. This Kaminsky, the centerpiece of the last Yale team to make the tournament, proclaimed that his Bulldogs “weren’t afraid of any team.... We never cared about how we won our games, as long as we won.”
The Yale faithful would do well to remember such lessons—and perspective. Their current squad, which took out Connecticut and appears unafraid of its Crimson rival, embodies Kaminsky’s words as well as any in recent memory. The team will remember that last year a 5-0 Harvard team got outplayed start to finish by a 4-1 Yale team at home, only to come back in the final week and stomp the Bulldogs on the road.
The journey back to the top starts with a snoozer in Philly.
Pick: Yale
BROWN AT PRINCETON
The Bears came off the mat by nearly completing the impressive home sweep of Harvard and Dartmouth. After Leland King’s departure, the team has massive Ewing Theory potential due to the outstanding play of sophomore guard Tayvon Blackmon. With Rafael Maia and Cedric Kuakamensah in the frontcourt, Brown can dominate opponents inside.
Against Princeton, however, the Bears must take care of the ball. That Brown managed a win against Dartmouth playing hot potato (19 turnovers) is darn impressive, but that won’t happen against a better team.
Pick: Princeton
COLUMBIA AT HARVARD
Before the season, this was circled as the game where Columbia rode its upperclassmen back into the top tier of the Ivy League. The Lions have been knocking on the door for some time—beating Yale by 16 at home last year before taking out Princeton in Jadwin. It returns to face its nemesis; Harvard has fared poorly in Levien the last two years, but has won the two home games by an average of 19 points.
Columbia—which takes more than 46 percent of its shots from three—has the league’s best offense while Harvard boasts the league’s best defense. Lions coach Kyle Smith compared Harvard to “a smaller version of Kentucky” this week. Smith’s team nearly beat Kentucky at Rupp this year before fading away, and a similar result is likely in Boston.
Pick: Harvard
YALE AT PRINCETON
This game feels like a kitchen sink game for the Tigers after Princeton blew a golden chance to sweep the Gentleman’s C’s last weekend. Both teams come to Cambridge in the next three weeks, where Harvard has won 27 of 29 contests; a loss here will push either into major desperation mode.
Pick: Princeton
BROWN AT PENN
Compelling your significant other to watch this game on Valentine’s Day would be relationship suicide on the order of making your six-month anniversary present a Qdoba burrito. Watching it alone might be even sadder—think post-midnight delivery orders from the Kong.
Pick: Brown
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
Other than the scintillating matchups of arguably the Ancient Eight’s best two point guards—Alex Mitola and Maodo Lo—this game is a reminder of what was once a bitter rivalry. I’m not referring to any chippy play between the two teams, but the past vitriol spewed by the Columbia Spectator. Hardly a decade ago, the Spectator ran a column called “CU vs. Cow School: The New Rivalry.” In addition to quoting a Columbia student who described Hanover as “a scene from the Shining,” the article’s writer argues that “[Dartmouth] is hardly even a safety school…their admissions process is about as selective as my Denver community college.” Oh my, Howard, this must be where those danged Ivy League snob stereotypes begin.
Pick: Columbia
CORNELL AT HARVARD
Through six Ivy League games, Cornell has proved it can hang with the heavyweights of the league. The Big Red beat Princeton last Saturday and gave Yale trouble down the stretch despite a terrible six-of-20 shooting night from star forward Shonn Miller. Cornell has an impressive top-75 defense, with Miller the fulcrum in the middle around which it all operates. The big man averages a combined 3.5 steals and blocks a night for a team that holds its opponents to under 38 percent shooting a game.
The problem for the Big Red is that they face a mirror image in Harvard. The Crimson has long stretches where it does not score the ball effectively, often asking junior co-captain Siyani Chambers or Saunders to bail it out late in the shot clock. The Harvard defense—12th in the nation, per KenPom—is another story, with five players often moving on a string. Harvard closes out on opposing shooters extremely well (31.6 opponent three-point field goal percentage) and cleans up on the boards (+4.1 rebounding percentage). Harvard has struggled in the past against teams that press, which Cornell will surely do, but the Big Red likely doesn't have enough offense to get past the hosts here.
Pick: Harvard

When a new venue opens in the Square, especially something as tantalizing as a ramen joint, there's always a quiet electricity in the air. Does this newcomer have what it takes to tussle with the legends of Harvard dining? To be clear: I'm poor and bad at sleeping so I consider Felipe's and the Market to be the leading culinary giants. Santouka Ramen's new location on Bow Street closes at 9:30 p.m. most nights (10:30 p.m. on Friday's and Saturday's) and looks sleek with its muted granite interior and spindle-legged light fixtures. The set-up is certainly more restaurant and less hangout, but when D-Hall dining gets me down, I find a hot bowl of noodles is just what I need.
The WaitAt 6 p.m. sharp, we blow in with the cold air: seven tired and hungry students haunted by all too recent psts and hours of section. The restaurant is flooded with its second day dinner rush and the small atrium space is packed with lost patrons searching for a table. We flash a smile at a frazzled hostess. The wait, she informs us, will be an hour. “Go walk around the square, we'll call you when your table is ready.” We “walk around” back to our closest common room.
We return an hour later without a call and minus two friends (the friends lost to dining hall attrition). Santouka has managed to become even more crowded in the interim, and our wait has been upgraded to indefinite. We move camp to Dunster D-Hall, losing our fifth member to Felipe's, and prepare to wait out the crowd.
At eight thirty tensions are running high. With no call in sight and Santouka closing in an hour, we begin making alternate plans. Can we do Le's? Is Le's even open? Should we give up on noodles and get burritos? Fed up with our nonsense, a member of the party dials Santouka and ominously leaves the room. A few moments later she returns, telling us to pack up to leave: our table is ready. What? She shrugs. “Sometimes you have to be a little impolite.”
The EatsIt's hard to stay mad at Santouka when we're seated at an excellent table within moments of arriving (our third time that night, to be fair), given a hamper to keep our bags off the floor, and pelted with sincere apologies for the wait. As the manager Cory later explained, there had been lines stretching down the street that morning since 10 a.m., and they don’t even open until 11. The dinner rush, with classes and work ending, was just as bad.
The menu is as streamlined as the architecture, and with four main ramen options (plus fixings), we decide to each order one. This fact greatly amuses the staff. We are apparently the only group to have done this so far. I get the Shio Ramen, their self described signature flavor. The service is on point: the moment I begin to wonder where our meals are, I find them on the table in front of me.
The food itself was fantastic. I don't even like broth that much, but I found myself downing the creamy soup by the gulp. Cory explained to us how the broth steeps in pork all day, lending it a rich and thick flavor. The noodles come out steaming hot and have a fantastic texture that soaks the broth right up. Don't bother trying to be polite when eating: the slurp is going to be the best tool in your arsenal. Opinions ranged on the soft bamboo sticks, but I found them tasty, if a little out of my comfort zone. The pork was divine, though I was only given two slices and quickly found myself wanting more.
The atmosphere of the restaurant felt casual, even when it was so busy. The one thing holding me back from really enjoying my meal was the price tag: twelve bucks before tip for a large bowl. For that kind of money, I can get Costco ramen to feed me for a month, a niggling voice in the back of my head moaned as I examined the check. And while the food was hearty, I didn't really feel full at the end.
I look forward to returning when the hype has died down, and the lines are under two and a half hours. While I can't recommend that anyone goes at peak time until then, I would certainly endorse a Santouka visit in the near-ish future.
The formal service and casual food makes it a good spot for a nice roommate dinner or low-key date, and the location is central enough that a trip is no great ordeal. I look forward to seeing how Santouka matures into its new location, and to sampling the rest of their flavors on future visits.
