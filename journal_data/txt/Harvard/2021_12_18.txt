After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maggie S. Chen ’22, a Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentrator from San Diego, Calif., was selected for the 2022 Marshall Scholarship on Monday.
Chen is one of 41 recipients of this year’s iteration of the 68-year-old scholarship, which funds graduate studies for American students for up to three years at any British institution. According to the British embassy, the program received nearly 1,000 applications this year.
A Cabot House resident, Chen said she was working on her research projects when she “screamed quite loudly” upon seeing the email notifying her of the honor. Chen’s roommate ran down the hall to first check on — and then congratulate — her friend.
“I got to go out and really celebrate with people that I cherish the most,” Chen said. “To share that moment with them was very, very special.”
As a Marshall Scholar, Chen plans to study bioengineering at Imperial College London. She said she is “incredibly excited” to continue working toward her goal of becoming a physician scientist through her studies abroad.
“This just truly represents how lucky and privileged I am to be a part of such a wonderful, kind, compassionate, and supportive Harvard community,” Chen said.
Chen said she was looking forward to experiencing the “spirit of research” in the U.K. and immersing herself in a different country’s culture.
“I’m excited to form over-the-pond research collaborations to learn from some of the best scientists in their fields,” Chen said. “I think it’ll be a great experience to spread my wings a little bit.”
At Harvard, Chen has spent the past three years as a research fellow in the laboratory of Professor Richard T. Lee ’79, who she said was her biggest supporter aside from close friends and family.
“My mentors and friends and colleagues in the laboratory have been so incredibly supportive and have taught me that it’s important not just to be a good scientist, but to also be a good person,” Chen said.
Lee, whose laboratory applies biotechnologies to work toward novel therapies for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases associated with aging, wrote in an emailed statement that Chen is a “brilliant” person.
“Maggie is truly remarkable, not only as a brilliant young investigator but also as a person,” Lee wrote. “Everyone in my department is proud of Maggie.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber told the FBI in January 2020 that he “wasn’t completely transparent” in a separate interview with federal investigators two years prior, according to video of an interrogation presented in court by government prosecutors on Friday.
Lieber, a former Harvard Chemistry Chair, is facing trial for allegedly making false statements to government agencies about his connection to the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese state program that seeks to attract academic talent to the country. According to prosecutors, Lieber joined the program to advance his goal of winning a Nobel Prize.
During the fourth day of the trial on Friday, prosecutors presented video excerpts of a three-hour FBI interrogation of Lieber, which took place at the Harvard University Police Department on the day of his arrest. Lieber told the FBI agent it “looks like I was very dishonest” with DOD investigators during a 2018 interview about his involvement with the TTP.
“I wasn’t completely transparent by any stretch of the imagination,” he said.
FBI agents showed Lieber an email he sent to a research colleague about his concerns with the federal inquiries into his ties to China, which prosecutors also presented in court Friday.
“I will be careful with what I discuss with Harvard University and none of this will be discussed with government investigators at this time,” Lieber wrote.
Asked by FBI agents in 2020 whether he was ever a member of the TTP, Lieber said it was possible he joined the program — contrary to his 2018 statements to the DOD. However, he said he didn’t think he fulfilled the program’s requirements, such as remaining in China for more than three months a year.
“I may have signed a document that was in Chinese that I shouldn’t have signed,” Lieber said.
In cross examination of FBI Agent Kara D. Spice, who helped arrest and interview Lieber in Jan. 2020, the chemist’s lead defense attorney repeatedly pointed out that affiliations with the TTP are legal.
“This trial does not contain any charges that are related to espionage, for example, right?” Lieber’s lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, asked Spice.
“No,” the agent responded.
Lieber initially told FBI agents in the interview shown in court Friday that he had not taken payments from a Chinese university, but he reversed course after being confronted with evidence.
“I think they claimed they were gonna pay me, but I didn’t get it,” he said at first.
Lieber was then presented with a contract he signed with the TTP in which he was to be paid $50,000 per month and $158,000 in expenses for his work with the Wuhan University of Technology.
“That’s pretty damning,” Lieber told the FBI agents.
Lieber said multiple times in the recording that he was unsure of the exact amount of money he brought to the United States from his trips to China, attributing errors in recollection to his “selective memory.”
Lieber is accused of falsely reporting his taxes by failing to include income from the Wuhan University of Technology. Prosecutors said he also did not inform the Internal Revenue Service of his Chinese bank account, which at one point contained the equivalent of roughly $200,000.
According to other documents presented by the government, Lieber received half of his payments in $100 bills during trips to Wuhan. When presented with this evidence in the 2020 interrogation, he told FBI investigators he did not declare or pay taxes on the money.
“If I brought it back, I didn’t declare it, and that’s illegal,” Lieber told the FBI.
Lieber told the agents that he and his wife decided they did not want the money from his Chinese bank account, attributing a change in his outlook to his deteriorating health.
“We realized that this was not an appropriate thing,” Lieber told the FBI. “To me, I’d rather not investigate how to get this money.”
Through Spice’s testimony, prosecutors introduced an array of emails and documents demonstrating Lieber’s involvement with the TTP.
When questioned by the defense, Spice said she has no firsthand knowledge of the incidents described in Lieber’s emails aside from the documents she read.
Mukasey then asked a series of questions seeking to establish that Spice was not aware of “the truth or falsehood” of the events in question and was just “reading documents.”
“Well, I’ve read them too,” Mukasey said. “We’ve both read works of fiction as well.”
Judge Rya W. Zobel ’53, a Jimmy Carter appointee who turns 90 on Saturday, instructed the jury to disregard the latter remark.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 18, 2021 at 6:47 p.m.
Harvard will move to remote operations during the first three weeks of January, keeping most students, staff, and faculty away from campus over winter break as Covid-19 cases rise.
The announcement comes amid a surge in Covid-19 cases on Harvard’s campus, where 344 affiliates have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days. The move will not affect spring semester courses, which begin during the last week of January.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Saturday morning, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote with other top administrators that the shift is “prompted by the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases locally and across the country, as well as the growing presence of the highly transmissible Omicron variant.”
The fast-spreading Omicron variant is already present on Harvard’s campus, the school said earlier this week.
Harvard's spring semester classes are scheduled to begin on Jan. 24, which falls outside of the three-week remote period. Faculty, staff, and researchers will work remotely during the first three weeks of the month “if possible,” the administrators wrote Saturday.
“We are planning a return to more robust on-campus activities later in January, public health conditions permitting,” the administrators wrote. “We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates on these plans as soon as we are able.”
Harvard College Dean Rakesh Khurana wrote in a separate email to undergraduates Saturday that the school is hopeful the buffer between the fall and spring semesters will allow it to reduce transmission risk before bringing students back in late January.
“While it is concerning to see a rise in COVID-19 cases locally and nationally, mainly due to the highly transmissible Omicron variant, it is helpful to have this happen between the fall and spring semesters,” he wrote. “In making these careful adjustments to campus activities in January, our goal is to reduce the risk of virus transmission and return for the spring term safely.”
Khurana also wrote that some individual academic pursuits — including senior thesis work — may occur in-person during winter break at faculty advisors’ discretion, even as University course instruction during winter break will be remote.
Despite the campus de-densification, Harvard athletic events scheduled for over winter break “will continue as planned,” Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott wrote to student athletes on Saturday. Spectators will still be permitted at games under current public health protocols, which include showing proof of vaccination and masking indoors.
McDermott added that student athletes who compete over the winter break will have to “strictly follow protocols.”
“There will be no team meals in restaurants and social gatherings may not occur,” she wrote. “We need to really go back to being in your team ‘bubbles’ when you are on campus.”
Other students will have to receive authorization to be on campus over break. Many undergraduates typically return before classes begin in January for winter programming on campus.
“Public health experts anticipate the increase in COVID-19 cases to continue, driven by the Omicron variant, which we have now confirmed is already present in our campus community,” the administrators wrote. “The Omicron variant is expected to become the dominant variant across the country in the coming weeks, potentially peaking in the first few weeks of January.”
Harvard announced earlier in the week that it will require affiliates to receive Covid-19 booster shots during the spring semester.
