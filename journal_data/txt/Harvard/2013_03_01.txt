Scene Recital by the Hyperion Shakespeare Company
March 1-2, 8 p.m.
Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Olivia L Ball ’14, Matthew B. Barrieau ’16, Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16, Emilie G.C. Thompson ’16
Produced by Alice F. Berenson ’16, Bethany L. Donovan ’16. 
At 8 p.m. on Friday in Adams Pool Theatre, Hyperion Shakespeare Company will present a series of student-directed scenes, each from a different Shakespeare play. This year, the theme of the scene recital is dysfunctional families. “We [got] to pick scenes that we’re really excited about…that we want to dive into and have fun with,” director and actress Olivia L. Ball ’14 says. The aptly titled “Family Feud” will play through Saturday.
Hyperion is a student-led acting group on campus dedicated to providing students with the opportunity to act, direct, and share a love of Shakespeare. Each semester, members of the Hyperion company’s board, called The Bench, select a theme for a scene recital and then choose segments from different plays which relate to that theme. This year, the plays include “Hamlet,” “King Lear,” “The Comedy of Errors,” “Coriolanus,” “Measure for Measure,” “Richard III,” and “As You Like It.”
“Family Feud” is a more digestible dose of Shakespeare because the short snippets are distillations of the members’ favorite Shakespearean moments. It is different from most other plays on campus in that “Family Feud” does not have one plot; the production is a medley of bite-sized pieces brought to life by the enthusiasm of its directors and actors. Each member of the Company brings a professed love of Shakespeare to their scenes.
“They get all of my nerdy Shakespeare jokes,” Ball says. “I’m directing a scene from Hamlet that I love, so it’s been really fun to see that come to life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may seem paradoxical to use words to describe the experience of stripping words of their meaning. This is the premise behind “Uncanny Val- ley,” a multimedia spoken word perfor- mance that took place on Thursday at Paine Hall. Jon Woodward, author of the poem “Uncanny Valley,” was joined onstage by his wife, Oni Buchanan, who is a pianist, and accompanied by the music of composer John Gibson and a wide range of pre-recorded digital sounds. Words played only a supporting role in this intense and unusual performance, which was meant to shock like the car crash it describes.
Woodward, who works as a curato rial assistant at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, is known for his eclectic poetic projects, which include a 40-foot-long poem written by typewriter on a single roll of paper. Buchanan, herself a poet, is a graduate of the New England School of Music and the University of Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Gibson is a well-respected composer and has written pieces for a variety of ensembles.
The event was a joint production of Harvard’s Woodberry Poetry Room and Ariel Artists, a classical music management organization that aims to connect talented artists with concert presenters and audiences appreciative of innovative music.
Woodward said his poem had two influences: a nightmare that he had in which he may or may not have caused a car crash that killed innocent people, and the phrase “uncanny valley.” This expression, coined in 1970 by roboticist Masahiro Mori, describes the drop in empathy that humans have when interacting with robots that look and act increasingly human.
To toy with this idea, Woodward said illogical statements and inverted and repeated them until they lost all meaning. Phrases such as, “What thoughts wreck thoughts / Could I rubberneck those?” were collapsed and ran together like bumper cars. Rather than narrate the story linearly, Woodward wanted to make the audience undergo their own dizzying experience with a distorted reality.
The performance consisted of 16 poetic components, read through continuously. The more the words were repeated and sustained, the faster their meaning slipped away. This phenomenon is known as “semantic satiation.” In this common psychological experience, a word that is repeated loses all meaning and becomes nothing more than sound.
Since he was reading his own poem, Woodward was at liberty to repeat words and whole phrases as much as he wanted. “I might repeat this from 0 to 225 times,” he said at the beginning, half in jest. Woodward has delivered the work 10 times, altering it each performance, since the work debuted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in September 2012.Woodward commissioned Gibson to compose an original concert-length score to accompany his words, although the piece does not deliberately illustrate the poem. “I wanted there to be enough variety of sounds to sustain the audience for the full hour,” Woodward says.The combination of meaning- less words, piano music, and digital sound—all playing at once—was overwhelming.
According to Woodward, the rhythmic pace of the performance was intended to make it difficult to process and rationalize. Buchanan’s jazzy play- ing ran over the words with anxious trills, eerie chords, and loud bangs, recreating the drama of a car crash. To traverse the range of human and robotic noises, Buchanan moved while at the piano, plucking and scratching its strings, playing up and down in dynamics. In contrast, Woodward delivered his equally jarring sentences in a calm and soft-spoken voice.As divergent and free-spirited as their individual performances might have seemed, they were closely synchronized with Gibson’s digital soundtrack—composed of mashed-up recordings of robots, music by com- poser Robert Schumann, and Wood- ward’s own poetry—which Woodward controlled from his laptop. The words and music at once amplified each other and clashed, creating a sonic house of mirrors.The structure of the performance encouraged audience members to linger over what Woodward calls the“visible fissile ribbons” of the poem’s language. Yet, the performance left no time for reflection. It combined several common elements—poetry, electronic and live music, and a commonly ob- served psychological phenomenon—to produce an original and disconcerting artistic experience.

“I agree with you, I want to do it, now make me do it,” Franklin D. Roosevelt told leftists during his presidency. As he understood, politicians respond to those who are best able to pressure them. And while climate activists can’t write out big checks in Manhattan and Houston, they can field whopping crowds on the National Mall—something they proved last Saturday at a protest against the Keystone XL pipeline. The recent Keystone protests should motivate the president to take real action on climate change, which could quite reasonably be called the greatest and most pressing crisis of our generation.
 The Keystone XL pipelines would bring oil extracted from the Alberta tar sands to the Gulf Coast for refinement and export. Climate activists see its construction as an existential threat to anti-global warming efforts. Many in the Great Plains are also concerned, for if ruptured, the pipeline could leak into the Ogallala Aquifer, the breadbasket region’s main source of water. Menaced by an end-of-days situation, climate activists, led by Bill E. McKibben ’82, a former Crimson president, and James E. Hansen, have rallied their energies, staging the biggest environmental protests seen since the movement’s 1970s heyday and the nation’s largest-ever climate change protest. 
 This brand of activism, drawing its participants from college campuses including our own, is just as necessary now as it was during the New Deal. During the 2008 presidential campaign, President Obama pledged that by 2050 he would lower carbon emissions by 80 percent and invest $150 billion in green energy. But those promises never materialized. The president expended precious political capital on health care reform and an overhaul of financial regulation, making it easier for coal-state Democrats to kill cap-and-trade legislation. If anything, his first term saw a retreat on environmental issues, with the president caving to the oil industry’s demands for more off-shore drilling and overruling the Environmental Protection Agency’s ozone directives. 
 These recent protests were seen as part of a craven political calculus, and thankfully they seem to have been only that. The high levels of participation from Harvard and other students are not only enormously inspiring, but they also point to the growing impatience of the American public with the president’s failure to take real action on the urgent problem of climate change and should create the political will for the federal government to do so. At his second inauguration, the president focused on the “the fierce urgency of now,” a theme into which climate action, cast as a moral and political imperative, figured significantly. But given Republican control of the House, chances of a congressional deal are nil. 
 Yet the president is not powerless. He has signaled a willingness to use executive orders to advance the environmentalist cause. Now, we have to make him do it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent discussions have detailed all too well how undergraduate education has failed. For too many, it has become a means to an end. Easy courses provide the means for a good grade. The right course titles will help in recruiting. Classes, and the work that they entail, have lost their value amidst the benefits that prestige may entail.
But there are still those of us who care about our education, the ones who take courses on the basis of personal interest. Many of us understand the opportunities provided here and the value of each class for our personal education.
There’s a problem, though. Most of us are miserable.
We face a relentless grind of midterms and papers. We intentionally place ourselves in a position of sleep deprivation. And we even compete with others about who has the worst workload at any given time.
Our culture has received a lot of needed attention recently, from inadequate mental health services to the inherent competition created by over 6,000 of the most ambitious and gifted students in the country. But the academic environment has failed to enter these discussions.
Both Harvard and Oxford draw similar students, place the same high bars for admission, and impose similar workloads. Logically, students should share similar experiences at both schools. Yet their experiences, on average, are completely different. And it stems from the academic environment.
Sure, Oxford students are stressed during final exams and other important points of their course, but they never endure the same weariness that pervades our campus. And there are never discussions about the Oxford system as a failure.
Oxford courses occur as individualized tutorials. Each week, the professor provides a reading list for a particular topic. The student then reads the sources and writes a paper typically between 2,000 and 3,000 words long. The student then meets the tutor, discusses the paper, and repeats the cycle for every week throughout the term.
The system is impractical, inefficient, and can sometimes feel outdated. But it also emphasizes the deeply individual nature of learning. Students bear the responsibility for every reading and every topic. They have complete control over their education.
And at its core, education remains a fundamentally personal experience. While discussions and evaluations are a necessary part of academic life, learning is a process that occurs internally. Tutorials, for all of their practical disadvantages, provide a nearly ideal means to structure and pursue that experience.
Harvard classes have lost that individual component. Even our smallest courses involve a performative aspect during seminar discussions. No matter our motivation for taking a particular course, whether personal interest or concentration requirement, we all must demonstrate our knowledge in some way to both teaching fellows and peers.
That element of our education comes through most clearly, though, during sections. Participation grades have transformed these discussions from a stage of collaboration into a stage of competition. The vast majority of students speak for the grade and not the material. And that is why we hate section. It has destroyed the purpose of itself.
Furthermore, these aspects of our education occur in the context of a failed academic culture. When many students only care about the grade and many professors do not care about the teaching, those who care about the material are left on their own. The will to learn erodes under the need to compete. Academic inquiry erodes in the face of apathy.
We desire to learn, but in this academic desert, courses lose their intrinsic value. It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the spirit of inquiry against an environment that reduces learning to a means for a good grade or a successful career.
Our culture needs to change. But it will be a slow and arduous process. In the meantime, all we can do is evaluate our intentions and ourselves. The irony of our current culture is that, in a way, it actually enhances the personal nature of education.
Isolated from the other students by our motivations and our professors by our priorities, we are left alone, both with our thoughts and the others who commiserate with us. And it is in these contexts that we truly learn.
This is the last bastion of education at Harvard. It occurs in our readings, not our lectures. It occurs in our conversations, not our sections. It occurs in the late night common room discussions and dining hall debates. But mostly it occurs alone, late at night, as you block out everything around you and silently continue to think.

A Shortage of Listening
Experiences with mental health difficulties are inherently, intensely personal. To make sweeping claims about mental health is very dangerous. There is a danger of isolating people on all sides of the discussion—those who work hard to provide care to our community can feel attacked by blanket criticism, and those who endure a very real struggle with mental health challenges can feel invalidated and uncared for.
As a Student Mental Health Liaison, the privilege I have had of working with students and administrators has left me knowing quite confidently that there are by no means “serious” deficiencies with Harvard’s mental health services. I make such a strong claim not to undermine the voices of those who disagree with me, but because it is a reality that whenever we need it, and to whatever degree we need it, we have support available to us. There are 24-hour emergency services, all manner of counseling options, psychiatric treatments, caring tutors and proctors, peer counselors, peer educators and much more. It is essential that our discussion about mental health not leave members of our community reluctant to seek help or to suffer alone.
Last week’s events showed us, however, that a lot of students feel like mental health services need improvement. Those feelings and opinions are, of course, valid. They are founded on real experiences and real concerns. There must, then, be some deficiencies—to me, those deficiencies are primarily in the listening and understanding in this dialogue.  Again, my experience tells me there is certainly a will to listen and understand. The “liaison” in Student Mental Health Liaisons exists to do this. Somewhere, voices have not been heard and concerns have not been understood. Students and the administration alike should listen actively and take each other’s concerns seriously. Only by understanding both sides can we come to understand the realities of the mental health experience at Harvard.

Mental Health: Awareness, Community, and Change
Are there serious deficiencies with Harvard's mental health services? Absolutely.  Anyone who has sought help knows about the agonizing delays.  In frustration, many look outside the Harvard system for treatment and help, and even then they face weeks-long waiting lists.  These delays put lives at risk, and the University must make changes.  But while we push for change, we, the students, must find ways to help ourselves.
Mental health awareness is one of the worst problems at the world’s best university.  Except when a tragedy occurs, mental health is never discussed in a positive manner.  These conversations are not easy, but the administration seems paralyzed by the difficulties involved with dispelling myths, providing access to support and treatment, and eliminating the stigma surrounding mental health issues.
When we discovered that neither the Harvard Kennedy School nor the School of Public Health offered any classes on mental health initiatives, a group of concerned graduate students created a movement that we are calling the Harvard Students’ Mental Health Initiative.  At the same time, the College’s recent rally on mental health and ensuing dialogue ignited a vitally important campus dialogue.  As a unified student body, it is time to start working together to create change that meets our needs rather than waiting for the University to force a solution on us.
Our initiative is open to every student—graduates and undergraduates alike.  We all know someone who needs our support.  The HSMHI seeks to initiate and develop innovative solutions for positive change and to create a network where we can rely on each other for fundamental support.  Together, we can insist on a positive, supportive, community-based approach that brings together supportive networks and pro-social connectedness to our student body.
The time to act is now.  We hope you will join us. Our Facebook page can be found here.

Say Sayonara to Self-Censorship
“You’re not alone.” It was the first message I found funky when I arrived on campus three years ago. I saw it in the bathroom stall, at exactly eye level as I took my very first squat at my brand new university. Imagine, within the first 15 minutes on campus, with my trousers round my ankles in a bathroom stall, Harvard was telling me that I was “not alone.”  I scoffed out loud that day. I giggled about the implication of security cameras being used in bathrooms to monitor the bowel movements of Harvard’s newly recruited future world leaders.
It was my first encounter with Harvard University’s unique panoptic pressurizing effect, something we might as well call the “System to Increase Anal Retentiveness Among Undergraduates” (S.I.Ana.R.A.-U., pronounced “sayonara you”). Did I say goodbye to myself that first day I arrived at school?  Unfortunately, yes, to some parts I did. I said, sorry, I can’t bring my pet ostrich with me to college. I said, sorry, I can’t bring my inefficient high school study habits. I said, sorry, I can’t bring weak sauce to this place of greatness. But this last apology was one I should never have made. Self-censorship is a cardinal no-no in self-care. If I had known this starting that first day in the bathroom stall, my conversations with friends and new classmates at Harvard would have been more open from the get-go.
This brings me to my main point. The first stage in making a difference in your own personal mental health and to those around you is open conversation. Like this one. Are there serious institutional deficiencies with Harvard’s mental health services? Are there serious deficiencies with nation-wide mental health services? These questions are posed to stimulate an incredible discussion and make moves that will save sleepless nights and possibly people’s lives. Just because questions seem big, this does not mean that we are powerless to answer them with local interpersonal changes every day. It’s a matter of making real talk. Try not to succumb to “SIAnaRA,” that septic system of self-deprecation and looking anxiously to the high achievers to the left and right. We are not in a diploma factory. We are given the opportunity to get to know incredible people when we offer to share our experiences, struggles, and joys with our peers. Forget “sayonara,” it’s time to think “konichiwa, hello, howdy, bonjour.” The Beatles had it right: Why say goodbye when we can say hello to new experiences, to alternative ways of feeling good about ourselves, to new friends, to new frames of mind, to alternative viewpoints, and always to the idea that every one of our peers has something surprising to share.

Mending
Sometimes, when talking about mental illness, we talk about “slipping through the cracks.” It means to get lost or to be forgotten; to escape notice, especially within a system.  It is not a perfect analogy, but maybe it is helpful for thinking about mental health in our system. We don’t talk about "falling out the drain." Drains would be easier to clog. These are cracks, and they are unruly. Some are gaping while others are fine and hard to see. Where are the cracks? When someone is denied access to care they need. When someone is told they do not need the care they are seeking. When someone could use services that exist but does not know it. When someone knows they do but never calls. When someone feels like there is no one here with a vested interest in them. When someone thinks the future looks pale and empty and always will. These are all cracks.
I do not know yet how to stop up all of the cracks, but I have the sense that they will have to go one by one and that any extra hands will help. Knowing what services do exist at Harvard and using them when we need to is a start. We should talk with administrators about those cracks we see. We should be honest with one another when we could use help. We should rethink the advising system. And we should remind one another when hope is wavering that people can and do feel better, that mental illness is not a life sentence, that we will stick around until the future’s looking bright and full again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Odd-number years are often painfully unsatisfying to devoted political junkies, the type that fervently read Nate Silver and make sure not to schedule any plans on Election Day. This off year, those interested can only turn to gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, in addition to the soporific qua Senate special election closer to home. Yet February was an unexpectedly uplifting month for fans of palace intrigue, and not just because of Netflix’s single-day release of “House of Cards.” Rather, world watchers have been provided the chance to witness the most interesting exercise in international politics—the selection of the successor to pontifex emeritus Benedict XVI.
When Pope Benedict XVI announced his resignation earlier this month, American liberal commentators began conjuring fatuous scenarios in which the Roman Catholic Church would quadrate with their progressive ideal of a crusader for social justice that is permissive of changing social norms. Former Crimson editor E.J. Dionne ’73 penned a provocative editorial calling on the College of Cardinals to forego two millennia of tradition and elect a nun. Others have chimerically proffered the suggestion of a Bishop of Rome in favor of same-sex marriage or abortion rights.
Regardless of the merits of these liberal pipedreams, such fabulous thinking serves little purpose when it comes to prognosticating the next pope. This is because each of the papabili was appointed by either conservative Pope Benedict XVI or his conservative predecessor, John Paul II. As such, the papal statecraft of the upcoming weeks will not fall on the left-right spectrum familiar to modern American pundits. Rather, those with their eyes on the Catholic Church will witness an old-fashioned display of regional politics, with the majoritarian faction of the Italian old-guard pitted against the new world stewards of growing global Catholicism. If the cardinals are mindful of the issues guaranteed to plague the 286th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church, they will select a papabile from outside of Europe’s boot.
Italian cardinals are likely to make a strong play for the pontificate, which has been on a 35-year hiatus from Mediterranean control. The election of Polish John Paul II in 1978 put the first foreigner in the Vatican in 455 years, and recent reports of the inner workings of the world’s smallest nation suggest that the Italian delegation is itching again for control.
Like in all countries, the responsibilities of the Vatican’s chief executive are geminate—the leader has to manage both domestic affairs and foreign policy. The latter might be especially important to the Holy See, insofar as the number of believers it maintains the world over is directly correlated with its legitimacy and moral authority. Unfortunately, the most recent papacy has succumbed to imbroglios in both realms, and it will be up to Benedict XVI’s replacement to right an increasingly tremulous ship. The next pope needs character such as that manifest in John Paul II, who was able to successfully toe the line between proselytism and diplomacy.
On the domestic side, Vatican City is currently in utter disarray. The shambolic condition of the apparently venal curia led Benedict’s butler, who was tried for stealing important papers from the desk of the pope, to describe his former boss as “a pure man in the midst of wolves.” Documents have been unearthed demonstrating how officials have been exiled for attempting to expose corruption within the city-state’s administration, and there is ongoing controversy surrounding the cozy relationship between the Vatican Bank and the Italian Mafia. All of this has been humiliatingly augmented by rumors of a secret dossier adumbrating claims of gay orgies and blackmail among high-ranking clergy. The Vatican has ascribed to the code of omertà in these instances, but even a grain of truth signifies the antithesis of good governance.
While it is easy to blame the cerebral ex-pope for a failure in executive leadership, it is also important to consider the identity of the power brokers in the Holy See. The Italian lobby is by far the largest interest group in the College of Cardinals, and their dominant position has reportedly been the source of pronounced infighting over which of them would eventually accede to the cathedra following Benedict’s departure. The election of any of them will inevitably lead to more internecine tumult, which is the last thing the Church needs as it continues to hemorrhage devoted followers.
This is the other crucial issue the next pontiff must address. Western Europe is now rife with secularism, and many nominal Catholics have become shaky, if not completely lapsed, in their beliefs. It would be difficult for a pope to come from a nation where even his own congregation has doubts about his spiritual primacy. For this reason, those who can circumnavigate their own ambition long enough to think about the future of the Church should look toward the developing world, where faith is both strong and growing. The College of Cardinals is lucky to have a host of compelling candidates from Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. While it would be naïve to suggest that cardinals from outside of the Italian peninsula are immune to political maneuvering, there is no doubt that a cardinal change in the Vatican’s personnel could only lead to a more catholic and apostolic future for the Roman Catholic Church.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mental, physical, and emotional wellbeing of the students at Harvard and all of our patients has always been the top priority for Harvard University Health Services. We are continuously working with students and the entire Harvard community to improve the services we offer and increase the quality of care that we provide.
Over the last decade, mental health has been a main focus for HUHS, administrative leaders, and students at the University. In 2000, the Provost’s Committee on Student Mental Health Services established a University-wide Student Health Coordinating Board to encourage collaboration, review standards and goals, and help educate the University community about available resources for students dealing with mental health issues. In 2004, a student mental health task force was created to examine the common and sometimes serious mental health problems faced by students. Undergraduate Council representatives and other students were members of both of these groups. These efforts resulted in the restructuring of our mental health and academic counseling areas to provide an overarching strategic view of these services for students at the University.
The student mental health task force had several other recommendations for the University, many of which have already been implemented, such as the addition of wellness tutors in the Houses, focused specifically on emotional wellbeing. Since that time, HUHS has continued to improve the mental health resources available to students. Some of these efforts include hiring more full-time psychiatrists, increasing the number of visits for mental health treatment through the Student Health Insurance Plan from 12 to 24, and working with over 200 students in the peer counseling and peer education programs. Students, including UC representatives, currently serve on the College/HUHS committee, the Student Health Planning Committee, and the Student Patient Advocate Workgroup.
Harvard has more full-time mental health staff than most other colleges. The national college average counselor to student ratio is 1:1600, and for private universities of our size it is 1:937. Harvard’s ratio is 1:750, not including the counselors at the Bureau of Study Counsel. The national college average of students seen for mental health concerns is 8.6 percent. In contrast, HUHS Student Mental Health Services cares for 15 percent of College students each semester.
In the spring of 2012, we invited three national leaders in student mental health to conduct a comprehensive external review of SMHS. During their visit they met with students, SMHS staff, residential life staff, and College administrators.
They concluded: SMHS is a well-run clinic that maintains health-related confidentiality as a top priority. According to the reviewers, there is a perception that SMHS is not working solely for the administration, so it is not perceived by students, faculty, and staff as having a political agenda. Instead, they continued, the University community trusts that SMHS is there for the care of the students. The review also found that SMHS is well resourced relative to similarly sized institutions and to other Ivy League schools, especially if one includes the BSC’s licensed psychologists and social workers, and that SMHS provides comprehensive individual and group counseling services, which have above average utilization numbers. Many students reported that once they were in the system they felt that they received great care, though it could be hard to get an initial appointment. Students, faculty, and staff all praised SMHS crisis services, and agreed that students were always seen in an emergency.
The external review helped us identify areas to focus on, and in response, SMHS initiated changes to improve access to first appointments for routine visits, and now has two full-time staff positions dedicated to access management and urgent care services. Anyone with an urgent need can usually be seen within 24 hours, and anyone with an emergency can be seen almost immediately.
In addition to these areas that we are working to improve, HUHS already has many well-established services and is accustomed to dealing with the different medical and mental issues that students face. HUHS currently provides a wide range of support and treatment options; in addition to these services, we also offer group and peer counseling and assistance with finding outside providers.
The mental health resources at HUHS are available to all students. All registered students are required to pay the Student Health Fee, which covers mental health and a wide range of other services at HUHS.
Students are also automatically enrolled in the Student Health Insurance Plan, which covers prescription drugs and inpatient and outpatient services outside of HUHS. Students with their own, comparable health insurance may waive enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan. However, insurance provided by other carriers may not provide the same level of benefits or access to area providers. We encourage students to carefully review their health plan coverage before deciding to waive enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan. Detailed information about coverage and waiving the plan can be found on our website, hushp.harvard.edu.
At HUHS our mission is to ensure that every student receives the care that he or she needs to succeed both personally and academically. As a community, we must work together to create an environment where this is possible through open communication.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2013, at 8:26 a.m.
Members of Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Harvard Libertarian Forum gathered Thursday evening to seal and send off a box filled with 1,624 letters for the Food and Drug Administration.
The letters, signed by approximately a quarter of Harvard undergraduates, protested a government policy that universally bans men who have had sex with other men from donating blood.
Over a six-week period last semester, the campaigners visited every dining hall to collect signatures and raise awareness among students.
The policy, a holdover from the era of the AIDS epidemic, effects a lifetime ban on blood donation for males who have had sex with another male since 1977.
The members of both organizations decided to start the campaign when they noticed that despite frequent blood drives at Harvard, there was little dialogue on campus about the ban, which they called “archaic,” “judgmental,” and “ineffective.”
“Students were extremely receptive, and [for] others that weren’t, we had a chance to engage with the issue, which is really valuable, too,” said Benjamin L. DeVore ’15, a former political co-chair of the QSA.
Though they acknowledged that theirs was an unusual partnership, both groups said that their interests aligned perfectly on the issue.
“We come from the standpoint that the government shouldn’t be intervening in medical affairs,” said Corinne H. Curcie ’15, president of the Libertarian Forum.
Every unit of donated blood gets tested for HIV, said Curcie, who also referred to a study by the American Medical Association that called the policy “ethically inconsistent” with the FDA’s other regulations.
The American Red Cross and the American Association of Blood Banks have also supported a repeal of the ban.
The letter Harvard students sent to the FDA cited the United Kingdom as an example, where replacing a similar lifetime ban with a one-year ban for men who are sexually active with other men increased blood donations by an estimated two percent.
“We just want to make it a smart policy,” De Vore said about the FDA rules.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one knew exactly when the martini glass first suction-cupped itself to the common room table. Or, for that matter, how so much mold started growing in a half-empty bottle of acidic Coke. But with Junior Parents Weekend only a week away and a roommate’s mom set to visit before then, Kelsey M. Muller ’14 said it became clear that both had to go.
“We were like ‘Oh my God, we need to clean,’” Muller said. So she and a roommate spent last Friday night doing just that, working for several hours to purge, pitch, and organize months of accumulated trash. By the time they finished at midnight, in time to celebrate the roommate’s 21st birthday, the duo had filled roughly six bags of trash from their four-person suite in Mather. They even produced a top 10 list enumerating the grossest items they had uncovered.
To varying degrees, juniors across the College have followed suit this week, hiding unwanted messes and unflattering alcohol containers in advance of their parents’ arrival.
“It’s impeccable,” Muller said of the freshly cleaned common room. “Our shoes are all lined up neatly in a corner in a line.”
“We’re not sure if we should dirty it a little before [our families] come because they might be suspicious that it is too clean,” Muller added.
For many, the annual weekend will be the first time their families have been back on campus since move-in day last fall. And though much of the weekend will be spent in uncomfortable togetherness at Boston hotels, dinners out, and House Master’s receptions, the unavoidable and much-dreaded room tour will set the tenor of the whole visit.
“Usually we clean it pretty regularly, but you know how it gets with midterms week and extracurriculars,” said Madhavi V. S. V. Duvvuri ’14 of Adams House. Usually, she said, her family is understanding of a small mess, but on Parents Weekend, the stakes are higher.
“This is a little bit different. All of our parents are coming, and I think that they expect that this is special and we will clean up for them,” she said.
Ayo A. Matory ’14 said that while her room is relatively tidy, her dad “has very high standards.”
While she always takes care to close drawers and hide any spare beverage bottles, Matory said that last time her father visited her Leverett single, not even scuffs on the floor evaded his eye.
Others preparing for weekend drop-ins said that while their own parents might not mind a mess or the other trappings of collegiate life, they have chosen to clean out of deference to roommates’ parents who have different standards.
“My dad appreciates a very clean room, but there’s just some stuff I have to put away,” said David R. Grieder ’14 of Eliot House.  “I have some trophies in my room that my dad would better appreciate not seeing, and my roommate’s parents would really appreciate not seeing.”

During a trip to Washington this week, University President Drew G. Faust met with prominent lawmakers, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, and Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, to argue against cuts to federal research funding that will take effect if Congress does not pass a budget deal sometime on Friday.
The cuts, collectively known as sequestration, are designed to slash 8.2 percent of most non-defense discretionary programs and will impact Harvard’s sponsored research funding streams from Washington, which totaled over $650 million in fiscal year 2012.
Faust, who called scientific research “a foundation of our success as a nation for the past 60 years,” said her trip had three primary purposes. The first was to greet new members of Congress, particularly Harvard alumni. The second was to explain the negative consequences of cuts to research funding, which she said propels both international competitiveness and economic prosperity. Finally, Faust said she sought to understand different viewpoints on sequestration and hone her own arguments against austerity measures by meeting with members from both parties as well as members of the executive branch.
In addition to McConnell, Kennedy, and Kaine, Faust met with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, U.S. Representative David E. Price of North Carolina, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, and Secretary of the Navy Ray E. Mabus. She also attended a lunch with several other representatives with varying levels of seniority at the Capitol.
“Everybody has been engaged in the conversation,” Faust said, adding that she received “a lot of advice” on how to argue for robust support of scientific research as persuasively as possible.
Faust said that Harvard alumni can be especially helpful for the University’s outreach in Washington because they understand Harvard’s mission and the importance of research.
Members of the “Harvard family,” she said, “can be very effective spokespeople.”
Faust has previously traveled to Washington to lobby on behalf of Harvard and its researchers.
During debates over the allocation of stimulus funds in 2008 and 2009, she pushed for funding for research as a source of economic growth.
Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for public affairs and communications, said before Faust’s visit that whether or not sequestration occurs, Faust’s visit to the Capitol can help to encourage focus on research funding in the long term.
“Policy dialogue is ongoing in Washington, even as deadlines loom,” Heenan said.

Beginning this September, visitors to the Radcliffe Yard will be greeted by the usual  flowers and park benches—and a newly installed exhibit of original student art.
In October, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study launched an annual University-wide art competition allowing students to solicit proposals and designs for an installation to be displayed in the garden bordering Brattle Street in the Radcliffe Yard.
The winning entry will win a $5,000 prize, as well as funding to install the design.
“Our mission as the Radcliffe Institute is to advance work beyond the classroom, beyond the usual curriculum, and so I see the garden as a way of doing that for the arts,” Radcliffe Dean Lizabeth Cohen said.
Cohen said she was excited about the student response to the new competition. Several College students and many from the Graduate School of Design entered the contest.
After hearing about the competition through an email list, Madelynne A. Hays ’13 and Oliver Luo ’13 decided to work together to create a design to enter in the competition. Their entry features a multifaceted dome with two-way mirrors intended to allow visitors to see multiple reflections of themselves when they view the display.
“Our common idea is to sort of make a work in response to the current situation with the creation of multiple personalities, like the multiple profiles a person could have on the Internet,” Luo said. “We wanted to make a work that would be interactive and bring the people who are visiting this site a greater awareness of that sense of exposure, sort of self-reflection.”
Avery W. Williamson ’13 submitted a plan for a light installation using warm, white LED lights. Her interest in the project stemmed from a history research seminar for which she researched Harvard’s past relationship with slave labor. The focus of her design is for visitors to think of “labor, light, and the fluidity of space,” she said.
“If chosen, my hope is that people can walk through the installation space and consider the different hands that constructed Harvard,” she said.
According to Radcliffe Institute spokesperson Alison Franklin, the winning design will be announced in either April or May.
The selected installation will be constructed during July and August before going on display in September. The exhibit will remain until June 2014.

The History of Science department unveiled a revamped sophomore tutorial this semester featuring virtual interviews, student-driven lectures, and a chance for students to engage in independent research.
Designed and taught by History of Science professor and department chair Anne Harrington, the class aims to challenge students by blurring the line between learning and teaching.
Harrington’s project was funded by a grant from the Harvard Initiative for Learning and Teaching. Founded in 2011 by a $40 million gift from Rita E. and Gustave M. Hauser, the Initiative provides resources for faculty such as Harrington looking to develop new ways of pedagogy.
To offer a more engaging and innovative learning experience, Harrington’s sophomore tutorial features original videotaped interviews as part of the weekly course material.
The department hired six junior concentrators to conduct interviews with experts on the topics discussed in class, according to Daniel Z. Wilson ’14, one of the students chosen for the job.
“I think readings, especially in the humanities and in the social sciences, can feel sort of anonymous,” Wilson said.
“It’s hard to put faces to the names and really have a feel for what it’s like for a scholar to do his work.”
According to Nathan Greenslit, a teaching assistant in social studies who oversees the logistics of the interviewing process, the recordings will become a permanent component of the tutorial in future years.
Greenslit said that history of science scholars have responded enthusiastically to the project.
“Behind the theory or scholarship is a human being who is really excited by the material,” Greenslit said.
In addition to the multimedia component, Harrington’s new tutorial divides the traditional lecture into sections and plenaries—sessions that consist of presentations led by student groups and discussions facilitated by Harrington.
“I’m not expecting people to be teachers, I’m not expecting them to do my job,” Harrington said. “I’m inviting them to take ownership of their materials.”
Finally, after the course concludes, students will have the opportunity to go on a two-week trip to conduct independent research through a grant program.
“We envision it as an opportunity for sophomores to have the kind of experience that [is] normally reserved for juniors and seniors—which is to say, research,” said Christopher J. Phillips, a history of science lecturer who oversees the program with Harrington.
Although the program is currently only funded for this year, Phillips and Harrington say they want the experience to become a permanent part of the tutorial.
“Our hope is that this will become a model across the social sciences—that concentrations and programs can use it to really show how sophomores can be involved in an in-depth research project even in that early stage,” Phillips said.
Enrollee Edwin L. Whitman ’15 put it another way: “[This model] should be replicated because it’s very much in line with what the college learning experience is about.”

The Allston neighborhood is the newest hub of authentic Swiss treats.
After months of community anticipation, Swiss Bakers, a family-owned bakery and café, celebrated its grand opening during a packed ceremony Thursday night.
The café represents the newest small business Harvard has brought in to revitalize Barry’s Corner, the area surrounding the intersection of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street in North Allston.
The grand opening drew as many as a thousand people over the span of the evening. Prize baskets were raffled off, and the conversation paused every 10 minutes as the drone of a 10-foot alpenhorn—a traditional Swiss instrument played by a man in traditional Swiss dress—boomed through the crowded café.
Throughout the evening, a staff of co-entrepreneurs—Swiss Bakers does not use the term ‘employee’—offered heaping platters of baked croissants, rolls, and sweets to the guests—who in turn are not called customers.
“We’re all about food-loving and guest-hugging,” said Thomas Stohr, who owns the bakery with his wife Helene.
From the iconic red cow symbolizing Switzerland on the roof of the building to the designated guest-greeter at the door, Stohr said that his priority is to convey Swiss culture to the public.
“Everything you get from us is Swiss,” Stohr said. “We want people to say, ‘I just visited Switzerland without leaving Massachusetts.’”
Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that he believes Swiss Bakers will “contribute to the vibrancy of Barry’s Corner.”
Two years ago, Harvard approached Swiss Bakers about the possibility of the bakery renting the Western Avenue location. The new site is 14,000 square feet, 35 times larger than the company’s flagship location in the Reading train station. To date, Harvard has worked to lease 900,000 square feet of space in Allston to commercial tenants, according to Lisa Hogarty, Harvard’s vice president of campus services.
Hogarty also said that the new Swiss Bakers—which is located in what was once a Volkswagen dealership—along with the recently opened Stone Hearth Pizza Co. represent an attempt by the University to bring pedestrian, rather than automotive, traffic to Barry’s Corner.
Allston Civic Association President Paul Berkeley said that he was looking forward to seeing a diverse array of new businesses open in the area.
In addition to serving the North Allston community, Swiss Bakers food will also stretch across the river to the College campus. According to Hogarty, Crimson Catering will begin to incorporate Swiss Bakers products into its menu.
“Look for it in a dining hall near you,” she said.

In the first union rally to ever take place in Memorial Church, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers gathered with supporters on Thursday afternoon to bring attention to its ongoing contract negotiations.
Harvard and HUCTW, which represents more than 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff, have been in contract negotiations since the old contract between the two sides expired July 1 of last year.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger estimated that 750 people were in attendance at Thursday’s rally. At the gathering, he called for partnership between HUCTW and the University, saying that while the two parties have had a strong relationship since the union’s conception 25 years ago, he believes recently the University has been less willing to compromise.
“True partnership has to be a two-way street,” Jaeger said. “and it’s time for us to cross over to the sunny side of the street for a little while.”
A University spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard remains committed to resolving the issues through the negotiation process.
“We have had positive and constructive discussions as part of the mediation process and will continue to work toward an agreement that is fair to employees represented by the HUCTW and to employees across the University as a whole,” the spokesperson wrote.
Thursday’s rally featured a variety of speakers, a conscious decision intended to demonstrate the union’s broad base of support, Jaeger said.
Jonathan L. Walton, minister of Memorial Church, wrote in an emailed statement that HUCTW members are “valuable and cherished members of the Harvard community.”
He added, “If there is any location on this campus where persons should feel comfortable expressing and debating ideas, particularly those of a moral and ethical nature, I would hope it would be the Memorial Church.”
For their part, speakers made a point of emphasizing their gratitude to Memorial Church for hosting the rally.
The union also thanked the student groups in attendance and Harvard’s other unions, which were all represented at the rally, for their continued support.
Jaeger said that the rally does not signal that the negotiations process is stalled. Instead, he said, it is an expression of the current sentiment within the union and among its supporters.
“When there’s a whole community of people who have an urgent concern, it’s a healthy and constructive thing to come together and share ideas and learn from each other and express that concern,” Jaeger said.

While the Harvard men’s basketball team looks to clinch a share of the Ivy League title with two wins at Princeton and Penn, March Madness has already started for other Crimson winter squads. Women’s hockey hosts Dartmouth tonight for Game 1 of the ECAC quarterfinals while women’s swimming and diving has already begun its three-day defense of its Ivy League title at Princeton. In addition, men’s hockey looks to wrap-up its regular season at the Bright with contests against No. 1 Quinnipiac and Princeton while women’s basketball hopes to make some noise against the Ancient Eight’s top two teams as it hosts Princeton and Penn. Here’s a look at some of the big numbers heading into the weekend.
Men’s Basketball
2003: The last year in which the Harvard men’s basketball has beaten Princeton on the road. A visiting Crimson squad defeated the Tigers, 67-61, on January 31, 2003.
1985: The last year in which a Harvard team has beaten both Princeton and Penn on the road. The 1984- 85 Crimson beat the Tigers, 60-50, on January 11, 1985, before traveling to Philadelphia the next day to edge the Quakers, 77-75.
Women’s Hockey
399: Career wins for Harvard women’s hockey coach Katey Stone, an NCAA Division I record.
1998: The last year in which the Crimson failed to advance past the first round of the ECAC tournament.
Women’s Swimming and Diving
3: Number of times that freshman Kendall Crawford has lowered Harvard’s 100-yard backstroke record. She enters the Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championship Meet as the Ancient Eight’s top seed in both the 100 and 200 backstrokes.
10: Number of events at the Ivy League Championships in which Crimson swimmers hold the top seeds. The meet comprises 19 swimming events and two diving events.
Men’s Hockey
0: Number of times in which the Harvard men’s hockey team has finished the regular season last in the ECAC. With two games left, the Crimson currently sits at the bottom of the conference, three points behind next-closest Colgate.
2004: The last year in which Harvard has defeated a No. 1-ranked team. The Crimson topped No. 1 Boston College, 3-1, at the Bright Hockey Center on Nov. 17, 2004.
Women’s Basketball
8: Ivy League Rookie of the Week nods for sophomore Temi Fagbenle. The British national teamer has also collected two Ivy League Player of the Week honors over the course of the season.
7: Victoria Lippert’s position on Harvard’s all-time scorers list. The senior is 44 points behind former teammate Brogan Berry ’12 for the sixth spot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend marks the last road stint for Harvard of the 2012-13 season. With games at Princeton and Penn on deck for this weekend, the Crimson has the chance to seal its place at the top of the Ivy League standings with back-to-back wins. The Crimson’s basketball beat writers answer five questions about this weekend’s match-ups.
 
1) Riding a four game win-streak, what kind of momentum does the Crimson have going into this weekend?
JSG: After last Saturday's win over Yale, I feel like Harvard has finally shaken off some of its hesitancy and is hungry for two more wins this weekend. The Bulldog match-up tested Harvard—the home team fought back against the Crimson, even taking the lead at one point, forcing Harvard to continually seek new ways of scoring and regain the advantage. After a huge first half from sophomore Wesley Saunders, the Crimson was able to turn to others for its offensive output in the second period, an option that was less available earlier in the season. The fact that this game was against perennial-rival Yale made a difference, too—the squad got the big win in front of an even bigger crowd, and was even able to land Saunders' first-half dunk on SportsCenter. All of this, I believe, will add to both the team's confidence level and momentum going into this weekend's dates with the Killer P's. If you had asked me this question after last Friday's game against Brown, where the Crimson temporarily fumbled away a large advantage in the second period due to an uncharacteristically poor shooting night, my answer would have been radically different. But wins help. SportsCenter helps. And, of course, beating Yale will always augment a team's momentum going forward.
2) What were the main keys to Harvard's success in its 69-57 win over Princeton at Lavietes two weeks ago?
HS: The keys to Harvard's win over the Tigers were being efficient on offense, limiting Ian Hummer, and defending the perimeter. The Crimson shot 48 percent from the field to Princeton's 40 percent, and had five players in the double digits. Sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith led the way with 14 points on five-for-five shooting from the field, and Harvard outshot the Tigers across the board. With top scoring sophomore Wes Saunders given the task of guarding Princeton's Ian Hummer, the Crimson had to find its offensive spark elsewhere. Saunders stayed tough on Hummer, who put up 18 points but was limited to 7-for-14 shooting. Smith's six blocks and seven rebounds were huge in breaking up Hummer and the Tigers' offensive rhythm. Finally, Harvard focused on limiting Princeton from deep. The Tigers--the second best three point shooting team in the Ivy League after Harvard--sunk four of their 11 shots, while the Crimson hit 7.
3) What should Harvard look out for this time around in its away match-up against the Tigers?
DF: If the Crimson is going to break its two-decade drought at Jadwin Gym on Friday, it will need to play its best game of the season. Since Harvard last defeated the Tigers, Princeton posted its two most impressive performances of the year in double-digit road victories over Cornell and Columbia. The Tigers posted a +34 point margin on the same trip the Crimson posted a -18 on just two weeks ago. In that same time span, Tiger star forward Ian Hummer has been on fire. Hummer made 17 of his 23 shots taken during the trip, compiling eight assists against just three turnovers and scoring 40 points on the weekend. In Lavietes, the strong interior defense of Kenyatta Smith and Moundou Missi—who rejected Hummer three times—helped Harvard force the Tigers to the perimeter, where they shot only four for 11 from behind the arc. Playing at home, the Crimson should expect Princeton to come out firing. Against both Cornell and Columbia, the Tigers asserted themselves early and entered halftime with double-digit leads. It will be Hummer’s last weekend at Jadwin Gym to cap off an illustrious career for the forward, who leads his team in points, rebounds, assists, and blocks. The crowd will be ready and with the Tigers will be looking to seize their opportunity to get back into the Ivy race, the Crimson has to play forty minutes of its best basketball.
4) How can Harvard make sure to easily handle the Quakers after a sure-fight against Princeton the night before?
MK: Perimeter defense will be the key to a Harvard victory over Penn this Saturday. When the teams last met, the Crimson clamped down on the Quakers' talented guards Tony Hicks and Miles Cartwright, holding the duo to 15 points on 5 of 21 shooting. If the Crimson can come up with a similar performance this weekend, Harvard should earn a season sweep of Penn for the first time since the 2010-11 season.
5) If Harvard wins out this weekend, what can Crimson fans expect for the rest of the season?
CEC: As is probably obvious by now, this is a huge weekend for the Crimson.
With two wins, Harvard would clinch at least a share of its third-straight league crown, improving to 11-1 in conference play while handing Princeton a key third tally in the Ivy League loss column. If that happens, it would be tough for anyone to catch the Crimson in the Ivy standings. If they lose to Harvard this weekend, the Tigers would need to win out and hope the Crimson drops both of its final two conference games at Lavietes Pavilion, in which case they would also earn a share of the title--and force a playoff for the league's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
But if history is any indication, getting two wins on the road against the Killer P's is easier said than done. Although the Crimson is the favorite heading into both of this weekend's contests, Harvard hasn't won at Jadwin Gymnasium since Feb. 3, 1989--before anyone on the current Crimson roster was even born. And the last time Harvard swept this road trip was during the 1984-85 campaign. At this point, the Ivy League's automatic bid to the Big Dance--along with the Ancient Eight title--is still very much up in the air.

February 28, 1928: New Memorial Chapel to Rise in Honor of Harvard's War Heroes
That the proposed University war memorial will definitely take the form of a new chapel to be erected in the Yard on the site of the present Appleton Chapel was made known officially last night. The announcement comes as a result of the passing of a resolution by the President and Fellows of Harvard College yesterday morning. The resolve was then submitted by the Corporation to the Board of Overseers at their meeting yesterday afternoon. It was voted upon, accepted, and placed on file. A committee will be designated to draw up plans and make the necessary investigations.
The adoption of the resolution to build a war memorial chapel culminates a movement for a University memorial which began early in the World War, as soon as the deaths of Harvard men were reported. It will require the demolition of the present chapel, but inside the new memorial there will be a small chapel which will be called Appleton Chapel.
February 26, 1940: Crimson Mob Swamps Folies Queen in Mad Publicity Stunt
Fifty Harvard men, Stan Brown's Crimsonians, the head of the Yardling Dating Bureau and his assistants, the Bachelors' Club, and a box of roses turned out yesterday afternoon at the South Station to greet the New Haven Express, which bore Mademoiselle Paris of the Folies Bergeres and 60 beautiful girls 60.
This "spontaneous" reception originated in the fertile brain of Ruben Rabinovitz, press agent for the Folies, and everybody connected with the University who wanted a little publicity joined the mad procession.
February 27, 1953: Furry Denies All Present Ties with Any Red Groups
Associate Professor of Physics Wendell H. Furry, who early yesterday refused to tell the House Un-American Activities Committee whether he is or ever has been a Communist, declared last night, "I am not a member of the Communist Party, I have no personal knowledge as to whether or not there is any Communist Party activity at Harvard of anywhere else."
Furry, who has been named by three earlier witness before the House Committee as a member of a Harvard "Red cell" in the 1930's, did not say whether he had belonged to the Communist Party in the past.
He refused to answer all questions pertaining to Communism or Communist activities under the provisions of the first and fifth amendments of the Constitution.
February 24, 1961: Exams, Final Papers—Or Revise The System
An ancient (and perhaps apocryphal) College rule once entitled students taking final or midyear examinations to receive a mug of ale at the end of the first hour. This sympathetic gesture seems rather anomalous for the strait-laced old Puritans who supposedly made it. Perhaps even they, despite their conviction that "all work and no play sends Jack to Heaven," had some unconscious qualms about the examination system.
Progress has eliminated beer-quaffing in Memorial Hall, but it has also done away with universal agreement among Faculty members that examinations are a Good Thing.
