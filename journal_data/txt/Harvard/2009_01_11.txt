After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting this March, high school students will have more flexibility in reporting SAT scores to colleges, the College Board announced last month. Under a revamped policy dubbed “Score Choice,” students will be allowed to decide which test results they report on their college applications. According to the College Board, the body that oversees and administers the SAT, Score Choice will help to alleviate the stress associated with college admissions and preparing for the nerve-wracking test. However, the policy change fails to consider the reality of being a college-bound high school student. Score Choice is a misguided formula for a multitude of reasons.
The idea that allowing students to hide specific SAT scores is advantageous is fundamentally incorrect. A major upside of requiring students to report all of their scores is that this dissuades students from retaking the test an excessive number of times. Presumably the College Board has been operating from the same misimpression as Harvard College Dean of Admissions William Fitzsimmons, who endorsed the new policy when he told the New York Times, “Score Choice will help defuse some of the pressure and give students a sense that not everything is riding on the tests, which really is the case.” Fitzsimmons is right that students should not feel as though their entire college application revolves around how they performed on the SAT—but this is precisely why Score Choice is problematic.
Fitzsimmons and the College Board have neglected the fact that many students taking the SAT under this new policy will inevitably feel that, because there is no disincentive for taking the test repeatedly, they ought to take it until their scores can no longer possibly improve. For applicants to competitive colleges, scoring a 2300 at first attempt will cease to be a happy relief, and instead be viewed as the first step in a marathon of test taking until they reach the magic 2400. Many students will inevitably spend more time preparing for and taking the SAT than they do currently, because there will be no downside to continually seeking a higher and higher score. Contrary to what Fitzsimmons says, Score Choice will further feed the unfortunate frenzy associated with college admissions, in which students too often sacrifice pursuing their real interests in favor of molding themselves into the perfect applicants. 
Worse still, under Score Choice, students may feel pressure to take the SAT much earlier in their high school careers than is healthy, in order to maximize their number of test-taking opportunities. Certainly preparing for the SAT early and adequately is helpful, but there is no reason 14 year-olds should already be thinking about how to best play the SAT game.
What’s more, the policy could inadvertently disadvantage students who lack financial means. From 1993 to 2002, the College Board maintained the Score Choice policy for the SAT II subject tests, allowing students to take them as many times as they wanted and to report only their best scores. However, the College Board ended the policy because it became apparent that the system advantaged students with greater financial resources, who had the means to continue pouring time and money into test prep. There is no compelling evidence to argue that this problem will not repeat itself. Although students taking the SAT may apply for fee-waivers, some students will not obtain them and others simply cannot afford to spend endless amounts of time indefinitely preparing for the test. In this age of so much educational advocacy focusing on narrowing the gap associated with wealth and student performance, the College Board would do well to avoid such a potentially damaging backlash.
Fortunately, the College Board is allowing colleges to decide whether or not they will accept Score Choice as an option for their applicants. The admissions offices at Stanford, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania among others, have already announced that they will not honor Score Choice and will continue to require applicants to send a complete score report. College admissions offices should not be afraid to speak out about the problems inherent in Score Choice. “We want to discourage students from taking the SAT more than once or twice and believe that programs like Score Choice encourage applicants with resources to take the SAT excessively to improve their scores,” Director of Stanford Undergraduate Admissions Shawn Abbot told US News and World Report. We encourage Harvard to reconsider its decision to accept score choice and recommend that other schools do the same. After all, the point of the college admissions process is to get a full picture of an applicant, not to convert them into a hyper-stressed seventeen year-old. Policies like Score Choice run counter to that goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The smell of baked ham and soggy lettuce on a dry nine-grain bun doesn’t typically make my mouth water, but shortly into my 2 hour, 21 minute flight home for Christmas, it sounded utterly delicious. “Excuse me, sir,” said the flight attendant. “Would you like some lunch today?” For a moment, I was disoriented—there was no five dollar price tag attached to the offer, only an enticing lunch box on her outstretched arm. And I had been addressed politely, an antiquated notion of civility other airlines had led me to give up on. Further surprising me, the attendant returned after lunch for a second time with a beverage cart. “We’re offering a complimentary second beverage to wash down lunch. Would you like something else to drink?” Had I fallen asleep and woken up in the ’90s? No—I had merely booked my flight with Continental Airlines.
I was still baffled, though. I had picked Continental for its direct flight and surprisingly low fare (roughly $220, including taxes, from Cleveland to Ft. Meyers), not expecting frills and stellar service. For me, these experiences dispelled the myth that most low-fare airlines want their thirsty, hungry, and frustrated customers to believe: that cheap prices and quality service are mutually exclusive. Low-fare airlines need to realize that offering competitive prices is only half the battle in being competitive, and that offering these fares is no license to actively destroy customer satisfaction.
Take luggage fees, for instance. With so many stresses already involved with air travel, the last thing one wants is to be slapped with extra costs. That’s exactly what almost happened to me at Logan’s AirTran counter when I flew with another small airline. Taking one glance at my bag, the woman in charge pulled out a tape measure. She proceeded to explain that its combined dimensions exceeded limits by less than one inch, and that I had no option but to pay an additional $40. The embarrassment and frustration of my fellow travelers notwithstanding, I held up the line and argued with the woman. Finally, I wrested the bag from her, tightened the luggage strap, and said curtly, “There is your three-quarters of an inch.” She shut up and took the bag. 
My experience with Continental was just the opposite. As I approached the check-in counter, laden with two large suitcases to study abroad, the Continental counter person noted that one of my bags was one pound over the limit. But she followed up by saying my other bag was ten pounds below the limit. It was illogical, she explained, to reduce me to the humiliation of opening my bags right there and transferring one extra pound of items to the other bag. I was saved. I was loved. And for the cheap fare I had paid, I was shocked. 
Once you’re on the plane, the humiliation doesn’t stop. On that same AirTran flight out of Logan, I ran to the gate, fearing I had made myself late with the luggage argument. I arrived sweating and parched. Just after the woman scanned my ticket, I noticed a water fountain no more than ten feet away. I asked the gate person if she would watch my bags while I stopped for a drink. Her dry response: “Sir, we are trying to board the plane on time. I can’t allow you to leave once your ticket has been scanned. I’m sure they can give you water on board.” They didn’t. Even after resorting to lying about a pill I had to take, the flight attendants did not give me a glass of water—perhaps they were too busy mixing cocktails for the tiny first class cabin’s one passenger.  
I understand completely that the airline industry is competitive and that profit margins are thin. The whole point of low-fare carriers, the argument goes, is that one suffers some inconveniences and a lack of frills for a better deal. And some say that more expensive airlines merely use the extra money on fares to pay for the supposedly “free” complimentary meals and beverages. But as my experience with Continental made clear, much of the inordinate hassle from flying with small airlines is completely unnecessary. Next time you are looking for flights, consider shelling out the extra few bucks for a more expensive airline—avoiding unexpected extra fees, escaping unforeseen hassles, and experiencing the deceptive joy of a “free” lunch will be well worth it.

An official from Harvard’s Italian program said that the College Board’s decision to cut the Advanced Placement Italian exam starting next year might reduce the number of undergraduates pursuing citations, secondary fields, and concentrations in the language.Elvira G. DiFabio, the Italian program’s director of undergraduate studies, said the College Board’s decision was “really unfortunate” because AP Italian allows “more freshmen into the advanced classes” and “may even lead them to consider a concentration.” Offering an AP Italian exam is also important because it offers an incentive for students to pursue the language in high school, she said. DiFabio said that the positive effects of AP Italian are not confined to academics. “Appreciation at a very advanced level of language and culture is also translated into the fact that language is not only taken as a prerequisite, but it becomes a unifying thread in who you are as an individual,” DiFabio said. She noted that for each of the other exams that were dropped—French Literature, Latin Literature, and Computer Science AB—there is another,  similar exam that students can take. “It’s not that they’ve taken those subjects out of the AP lineup,” DiFabio said. “But Italian now has no representation in the AP program.”(The College Board will maintain French language, Latin Vergil, and Computer Science A exams.)The decision to cut the AP Italian program has “many serious consequences,” according to Margaret Cuomo, founder and president of the Italian Language Foundation, which led the recent efforts to raise funds to continue the AP Italian exam. Aside from the lost opportunity for students to gain college credit, “it also affects the teachers deeply, particularly in this time of economic instability,” Cuomo said. “There are schools that are considering dropping their Italian programs altogether because there is no continuation to an AP course.”The AP Italian exam was first offered in the 2005-2006 school year in part due to efforts by Italian-American groups and the Italian government. In April 2008, the College Board announced that it planned to cancel four of its least popular AP exams after the 2008-2009 school year. The College Board said that it would offer the Italian exam for one more year if $1.5 million could be raised. Although the Italian Language Foundation raised over $650,000, the group ultimately fell short of the required amount.Cuomo said she believes that the exam will come back in the future. “The College Board left the door wide open for reinstatement of the program if funding is [found] in the next year,” she said.“We looked to the Italian government to make up the balance,” Cuomo said. “The cancellation came as a big shock to them. They thought the timeline was more negotiable. Now they realize the impact of their inaction—they are mobilized to be proactive.”—Staff Writer Melody Y.

Though students returning from Winter Break may no longer have the opportunity to enjoy homemade meals, yesterday’s Winter Wonderland brunch extended the period of holiday feasting while giving students a glimpse into HUDS’ new seasonal menu.Featuring specials like apple crisp, chocolate fondue, made-to-order omelets, and baked stuffed eggplant, the festive event received rave reviews from students hungering for both gastronomical stimulation and a break from studying. In Annenberg Hall, Elizabeth R. Moroney ’12, sampled dried fruit and pound cake, calling the food “absolutely delicious.”“We should have this every week,” she added, before heading back for another piece of crispy French toast with glazed apples.While the reading period brunch was designed to give students a chance to relax and recharge, HUDS is also implementing more lasting changes for the next 10 weeks as it transitions to the winter menu. The seasonal dining changes­—­made three times a year—reflect both the availability of foods and students’ feedback, according to HUDS’ executive director, Ted Mayer.In response to student demand, there will be more fruit variety in the winter menu. Beside the current staples, apples and bananas, students can expect a rotation of citrus fruits like tangerines, clementines, and mineolas, as well as kiwis, plums, and peaches. HUDS is also addressing students’ request for more vegetarian options by featuring two hot vegetables at every lunch and dinner, such as brussels sprouts, sautéed spinach, kale, savoy cabbage, swiss chard, sautéed mushrooms, and peppered turnips.Sunday brunches will feature a bagel bar with flavored cream cheese, smoked salmon, and preserves; dessert stations with ice cream sundaes, floats, or smoothies; and entrees like baked polenta, country biscuits, and Dutch apple pancakes.Another new feature will be Thursday night Meet & Greets, where students can mingle with the manager or chef of their dining hall. In addition to being a channel for communication, these events will serve as “tasting opportunities” for new items such as calamari diavolo and bruschetta, according to HUDS spokeswoman Crista Martin. Students can get creative by crafting their own spicy lettuce wraps, curry and naan, and panzanella at Monday and Friday’s Make Your Own stations, and enjoy new hot entrees like specialty paninis, chicken Philly cheese steak, chicken and sausage jambalaya, and ethnic dishes like Basque style chicken, Moroccan pork tangine, and beef moussake.Though seasonal changes are planned in advance, Martin said that HUDS constantly reviews menu items. “As we get feedback, we’ll see how it’s going, and we might make adjustments,” she said.But there is some variance in the excitement and anticipation for the new winter menu. “As long as they keep the Cracklin’ Oat Bran,” Theodora M. Skeadas ’12 said, “I’m good.”—Staff Writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

After two years of fruitless attempts, the Undergraduate Council took its first step toward providing students with cable television in their dorms as part of a pilot program run by an outside vendor.  Though the UC overwhelmingly passed a bill yesterday requiring its members to e-mail their House lists about the opportunity, the council declined to formally put its stamp of approval on the project, known as Crimson Cable, because of fears of legal liability. Crimson Cable, founded and headed by Nicholas J. Castine ’10, plans to conduct a trial run that would provide 100 students with 250 television channels over the Internet. Students who sign up within the next week or so will likely have cable by the start of second semester, according to Castine.Despite its support of Crimson Cable, the UC is cautious about claiming any responsibility for the program. The UC will only inform the student body about Crimson Cable without actually managing the program.“We’re not actually running the program, or tied to it, or partnering with it,” said outgoing UC President Matthew L. Sundquist ’09. “Nick is accepting liability.”“We need to publicize [Crimson Cable] without having any sort of institutional tie to something that is legally dubious,” said outgoing vice president Randall S. Sarafa ’09 during yesterday’s UC meeting. But Castine said legal issues concerning Crimson Cable are “gone” at this point in time because he has been in direct contact with representatives from the Dish, a satellite television provider.Crimson Cable subscribers will use Slingboxes, which allow access to cable television channels on the Internet. Unlike other proposals, the service will not require the installation of any cables. Castine hopes to make the service available across campus and will limit the number of Slingboxes to six per House.“I think of it really as a coop, just a bunch of students banding together to get TV,” Castine wrote in an e-mailed statement. “I don’t like to think of it as a business.”Crimson Cable will cost $59.99 a month, in addition to startup costs like the Slingboxes, Castine said.While the UC is currently not a managing partner, Sundquist said a successful trial may encourage the UC to further its investigation of the service.Castine said the UC’s endorsement was important “just for getting the advertising out.”Castine said he had been working to find a solution to the lack of cable on campus for a few years.“It was ridiculous,” he said. “There are so many simple ways to do something like this.”Noah S. Selsby ’95, a client technology adviser at FAS IT, said despite discussions with the UC about Crimson Cable, FAS IT remains unsure about its effects.“People use all sorts of network devices on our network... [and we] don’t want to know what those are unless there is a reason,” Selsby said.—Staff Writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

A software program called Identity Finder that scans for the presence of high risk information, such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, is currently being installed on most central administration computers, according to Robert Cahill, the University Information Systems director of support services. According to guidelines released by Central Administration Information Technology, administrative computers must not store what they deem high-risk, confidential information “in any way relating to Harvard or Harvard sponsored activities on any individual user computer or portable storage device.”The software is being installed “to make sure computers are compliant,” Cahill said. “All this software really does is allow you to know easily what is on your computer. This is a tool—a very non-intrusive tool, more of a scanning tool.”Cahill said that the information would not be stored or reported in any way. “It reports the information to the user,” he said. “It does not report to a server. We are simply allowing users to understand what is on their desktop.”Noah S. Selsby ’94, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences client technology advisor, said the initiative currently affects only central administration and not the FAS or the College . The software will be installed on all central administration computers in the “next couple of months,” Cahill said.—Staff writer Ellen X.

At 8:30 a.m. on Jan. 20, president-elect Barack Obama will be preparing for his inauguration as the 44th President of the United States of America.  At the same time, hundreds of Harvard students will be sitting down in large lecture halls readying themselves to take their fall term examinations—45 minutes earlier than expected.The change in time of morning exams on Jan. 20—exams will begin at 8:30, not 9:15—is the result of a compromise the administration has struck with the student body so that students can watch Obama be sworn into office. Some students said they are not pleased with the change, which was announced on Thursday.James R. Colombe ’10 expressed annoyance at the change, which he thought was unnecessary.“It adds a lot of pressure,” he said. “The information was given to us at a very late date. Exams are stressful enough.”Alli Chandra ’10, another morning exam-taker, had a different take.While she expressed irritation at having to wake up 45 minutes earlier, she also said that the change didn’t “make that much of a difference” and added that she thought it would be nice to watch the inauguration live.The issue of inauguration-day exams has been a point of contention since Nov. 17, when the exam schedule was posted on the Registrar’s Web site. Two-thousand students have exams on Jan. 20, some of whom were planning on attending the inauguration in Washington, D.C.  Jason Y. Shah ’11 and Tanuj D. Parikh ’09 created a petition to protest the administration of exams on inauguration day, with the goal of allowing all students taking exams on the 20th an excused make-up option. The petition gathered 600 signatures.Parikh, who has his Government 1368: “The Politics of American Education” exam on the morning of the 20th, said he is not pleased with the compromise the administration has come up with.   He called the new policy “unfair” because it required all students to wake up earlier, even if they did not care that much about the inauguration. “It’s very frustrating because it’s just not what we asked for,” he said.—Staff writer Sofia E.

It’s Friday night at the Cambridge Queen’s Head, and Harvard rock band Start, Go! is warming up on stage. Over the lively buzz of conversation, and with the smell of french fries in the air, the five band members jam on their instruments and adjust sound levels.Finally, 20 minutes after the show was slated to begin, the black-clad lead singer, Chris XX. Powers, steps up to the microphone. “Hello everybody! How are you all doing tonight?” he says. The audience responds enthusiastically.Powers announces that the first song they will perform, entitled “Honest,” will be available on their EP, to be released by Veritas Records—”Harvard’s only student-run record label”—in January.He gives a shout-out to Tony M. Spaniola ’10, the CEO of Veritas, who is running the soundboard. Then, he launches into “Honest,” an earnest soft-rock tune.Two days later, Powers is working on music again. But this time, he is on the other side of the microphone. As chief recording officer for Veritas, he is working with another band, Shy October, in his cozy home studio in Brookline.As snow falls outside, band members Caitria E. O’Neill ’11, Julie M. Wright ’11, and Luke L. Sperduto ’11 huddle around the piano and work on their song “Odd Results.”Soon, O’Neill steps up to the microphone to record vocals. Her bandmates take the opportunity to get a little homework done, and Powers jokingly tells them, “Homework is not rock and roll!”These are just a few scenes in the evolving life of Veritas Records. From performances to album production, the label fills a unique role in the Harvard community as one of the sole outlets for students interested in modern music. With a host of new projects and bands, the label is gearing up for what it hopes will be its most prominent, prolific, and exciting year yet.THE HISTORYVeritas began in 2003 as the pet project of Matt L. Siegel ’05 and Dan J. Zaccagnino ’05. In their sophomore year, Zaccagnino came to Siegel with the idea of creating a Harvard record label. Similar labels had been created at New York University and Berklee College of Music, but Harvard was lagging in creating a forum for students interested in popular music. “There wasn’t much of a live music scene at Harvard but there were a lot of talented musicians,” Siegel said. “What we wanted to do was to give them an opportunity to record professional quality music and reach more fans.”The Undergraduate Council initially offered very little funding for the project, so Siegel and Zaccagnino raised money from family and friends. Zaccagnino recalled, “When we started, we did all the recordings using our own equipment. We did it everywhere from the practice rooms in Leverett Towers to breaking into the Office for the Arts and recording at one a.m.”In its first year, Veritas released a compilation album containing one or two tracks from several prominent Harvard bands and then organized a release party for the album at the Roxy Club in Boston. The following year, they recorded a second compilation CD with Harvard musicians.One of Veritas’ lesser-known contributions was its role in establishing the Queen’s Head Pub. Working with then-fun czar Zachary A. Corker ’04 and Harvard Student Agencies president Daniel L. Rodriguez ’05, Siegel and Zaccagnino organized roughly 10 pub nights in Loker Commons in order to demonstrate interest in creating a social space. Ultimately, the Queen’s Head was created from what Zaccagnino called “an empty place where people met for math tutoring.” Siegel and Zaccagnino decided to pursue music full-time after Harvard, and they have since founded Indaba Music, a Web-based service that connects musicians around the world and allows them to record music online. The site now boasts more than 100,000 members and is growing rapidly.“We enjoyed bringing opportunities to Harvard musicians and I think this gave us the opportunity to do that on a much greater scale,” Siegel said.Meanwhile, the label established a recording studio in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. Current chief Spaniola took over last December.THE EVOLUTIONUnder Spaniola and general manager Caitlin V. Crump ’10, Veritas has entered a period of rapid evolution. “This year, we’re really trying to focus on booking these bands in Cambridge and recording full-length albums,” Spaniola said.Another central architect of this expansion has been Powers. With five years of experience as a recording engineer, Powers came to Spaniola last fall interested in joining the label. He began running recording workshops, and met with Spaniola over the summer to discuss Veritas’ direction.“We all wanted to turn this into a legitimate label where we signed artists,” Powers said. “Once we’d set down that model for the label, we asked ‘How are we going to go about finding the best talent at Harvard?’ We decided a Battle of the Bands would be best.”Veritas quickly publicized the Battle, and approximately 50 demos were submitted to the label for consideration. Nine bands were selected to compete for yearlong contracts with Veritas.The bands performed at the Queen’s Head on Nov. 7, and four groups emerged victorious to sign with Veritas: Shy October, The Ben Kultgen Band, Elephantom, and Start, Go!THE BANDSThe bands exhibit diversity in age and musical style. The one thread that links them all is a shared commitment to pursuing music at Harvard—even though many members say the scene here is almost stiflingly geared toward classical music and a cappella.Shy October is the only band comprised entirely of Harvard students. Singer Caitria O’Neill said she failed to find a satisfactory musical outlet her freshman year. This year, she visited the Veritas Records booth at the activities fair and said she became intrigued.“They told me they could record music and help me book shows around the area—that got me really excited,” O’Neill said. She submitted a demo to the Battle of the Bands and was chosen to compete. With a few quick phone calls, she assembled her roommate Julie Wright and her friend Luke Sperduto to form Shy October.The band’s music is difficult to categorize, incorporating a wide range of instrumentation and unusual melodies. As O’Neill said, “I have a really quirky voice so I write really quirky music.”The Ben Kultgen Band is led by recent alum Benjamin M. Kultgen ’08, and includes three of his friends from Berklee. Kultgen said he “got a full dose of e-recruiting” in his senior year and “made a very conscious decision” to pursue music full-time after Harvard.“I’m really lucky that the guys in my band area all professional musicians,” Kultgen said. “They’re just virtuosic, which sort of gives me license to be ridiculous on stage.”He also looks forward to the opportunities that the contract will afford his band. “We’re really excited to get into the studio and bang out some tracks,” he said.Elephantom is the youngest band on the label, including three members still in high school. Matt A. Aucoin ‘12 is the keyboardist and sole Harvard student.“I would certainly characterize our music broadly as rock,” said Aucoin, who also discovered Veritas at this year’s activities fair. “We do a lot of loud overpowering stuff, but we also do a lot of softer, more sensitive stuff.”Elephantom may be co-headlining a summer tour, organized by Veritas, with Start, Go!After establishing his managerial involvement with Veritas last year, Powers decided to compete in the Battle with his recently formed band. “The Battle of the Bands was our first show,” he said.Powers explained that he is focused on the future. “We’re going to try to give music a legitimate go,” he said.THE FUTUREBesides recording and promotion, Veritas has a number of plans for the spring. Chief among these is its partnership with Rolling Stone magazine to host “Rock Hard,” a Boston-wide search for the best college bands.The idea originated with Spaniola, who decided to approach Rolling Stone, a long-time sponsor of Veritas. The magazine responded enthusiastically, and the plans have since expanded to include eight Boston schools: BU, BC, Emerson, Northeastern, Berklee, MIT, Tufts, and Harvard.In February, each school will host its own Battle of the Bands in order to select its most talented group. On April 10, a winner will be selected in a final round. The event will include a celebrity judge and coverage by MTV, and the winning band will be profiled in Rolling Stone.    As to the longer horizon, the managers of Veritas are always looking to expand their activities and to extend their contribution to Harvard’s music sphere. “We’re really trying to help put together a rock scene,” Spaniola said. “The game plan is just to continue to do this. Next November, we’ll sign a new group of artists and begin from there.”—Staff writer Evan T.R. Rosenman can be reached at erosenm@fas.harvard.edu.

Is Big Brother watching? A Department of Homeland Security program calls for the installation of around 180 surveillance cameras in the Boston metropolitan area, including eight in Cambridge—a prospect that has sown confusion and concern on the Cambridge City Council.In response, the Cambridge Civic Unity Committee, chaired by City Councillor Marjorie C. Decker, will be holding a meeting on Jan. 22 to discuss the surveillance program and to address community concerns.“The fact that [the cameras] were installed is news to me, and to most of my colleagues,” Decker said. “It’s a little disconcerting.”According to Donald E. McGough, director of the Boston Office of Emergency Preparedness, $4.6 million has been invested since 2004 to install the network of cameras that runs through the nine cities and towns comprising the Boston Metropolitan Area. While the operation of individual cameras is left to local police departments, the network is supervised by the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which can take control of the cameras with  local permission.The Cambridge Police Department did not respond to interview requests regarding the surveillance program.McGough said that the network “can and will be used for [the] sharing of information beyond just video,” and includes data and voice communication capabilities as well.But confusion has arisen among the councillors about whether the cameras have been installed, and, if so, what they are being currently used for. McGough said that while he was aware of plans to install cameras in Cambridge, he was unsure if the cameras had already been installed or if they were operational.Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that the cameras, which are administered by the Cambridge Police commissioner, are installed but not in use. The cameras will only be used during an “emergency evacuation situation,” Kelley said, adding that he did not know the locations of the cameras.Most city councillors interviewed said they were not sure whether they support the installation of the cameras, preferring to reserve judgement until next week’s hearing.Councillor Sam Seidel said he was wary of encroachments by state and federal officials into the operation of the cameras and the processing of the taped material, noting that it was important to determine where the material was stored.“As we get further and further away from the local community, the more wary I become,” Seidel said. “If this ends up becoming a purely federal program, I want to know a whole lot more. If it’s purely local decisions, by local players, I feel more comfortable.”Local political pundit Robert R. Winters, a Harvard Extension School instructor, dismissed the suggestion that civil liberties were threatened by surveillance cameras.“I see this as completely benign, completely a non issue,” Winters said, noting that surveillance cameras commonly operate around ATM machines and bus stops. “The two words that say it all are ‘public street.’ A public street is just that: you are out in public, and every pair of eyes on every human being is doing surveillance on you. It’s just the way it is. I don’t understand this misplaced notion of privacy there.”The Boston Globe reported that opposition from residents has thus far prevented the installation of 12 cameras Brookline. The Brookline town selectmen will vote on Jan. 13 whether to become only the second municipality in the country to reject federal funding for Homeland Security cameras. The only city that has done so to date is Washington, D.C.—Staff wroter Sarah J. Howland can be reached at showland@fas.harvard.edu. —Staff writer Peter F.

Zigzagging around the globe on a jet may not sound like the most environmentally-friendly activity, but environmental science professor Steven C. Wofsy and his team are doing just that in an effort to measure the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.A modified plane, outfitted with equipment, technicians, and scientists, will make five flights by 2011 as part of a  $4 million, three-year mission to collect samples of air from different parts of the world. The first round of flights began Friday and is scheduled to be finished by the end of January. “What we will get out of this is a chemical picture of the atmosphere like you were slicing an orange and get[ting] a cross section of the orange,” said Wofsy, speaking from a Federal Aviation Association hanger in Anchorage, Alaska. “If you take a slice of the middle, you see all kinds of wonderful structures that tell you how it is put together and how it functions.”During the first leg of the mission, the crew will go from Colorado to Montana to Alaska to New Zealand to the American Samoa to the South Pole to Tahiti to Easter Island to Costa Rica and then back to Colorado.The first two parts of the mission, Montana and Alaska, have been successfully completed, Wofsy said, adding that the researchers found “a very marked difference between the air you find in the United States and the arctic.”Unlike satellite imagery, the previous source of data on carbon dioxide concentrations, the plane will be able to collect actual samples of the air and from a much closer range.“We are interested in the sources of the gases from the ocean, China, and North America,” Wofsy said. “We know which countries are emitting—we are trying to see how much. We are not trying to point fingers.”The plane collects data through four different “classes,” Wofsy said. The first class of instruments “sit[s] on the wing and measure[s] right there in real time.” Such instruments “measure little particles and the water in the atmosphere.” The second class collects data every second through an inlet in the cabin of the plane. A third class takes in air every minute or two. And the fourth class collects actual samples of air and seals them in canisters for later study. The first and second classes of instruments “provide a continuous view of what you get as you pass though the air,” Wofsy said. The third and fourth classes “can help you put the point data in context, so you have a tremendous amount of cross data between the various measurements.”The data the plane collects will be “fed into computer models” in order to help “put together the picture of where the carbon dioxide is coming from,” said Bob Henson, a science writer at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.The outputs of such models could potentially contribute to global discussions about the environment, he said.The mission, which has been in the works since 2004, will cost “$2 million for the science and another $2 million for the operations—the fuel, pilots, maintenance of the aircraft,” and is being funded and supported by the center for atmospheric research and the National Science Foundation, which owns the plane. “This plane is not sold for commercial use—it is sold for very high-end executives, and we of course don’t have it configured anything like they would,” Wofsy said.—Staff writer Elyssa A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maximilien Yelbi sits at a large breakfast table that is set for 10 people. He spreads butter and jam across a piece of dry bread. The simple fare is reminiscent of a French snack that he says his mother often prepared for him.Yelbi is a twenty year-old French student, originally from the Cote d’Ivoire. Unlike many Harvard students, he did not arrive in Cambridge with the certainty of a sparse-but-stable dorm life ahead of him. At 8:00 a.m., Yelbi will soon be forced out of the room, into the cold. At the homeless shelter at the First Church in Cambridge, Yelbi is the youngest of the shelter’s 14 guests. He joins an ever growing population that finds even the barest of necessities—a warm bed, breakfast, and consistent shelter—hard to find, especially in difficult economic times.Over the last two years, Yelbi has gone from being a hopeful, college-bound high school senior, to living day-to-day on a meager income garnered from tutoring jobs at a local community college. He sleeps by night in one of the few relatively-safe homeless shelters in the Cambridge area, including the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, a student-run organization affiliated with the Phillips Brooks House Association.The events that made him homeless would also connect him to a group of Harvard students, volunteers at HSHS, who would help make his dream of attending college a reality. PREPARING FOR “D-DAY”In January 2008, Yelbi arrived at HSHS having exhausted the group of friends who had, for months, allowed him to sleep their floors and couches. Peter N. Ganong ’09, one of the shelter’s directors, remembers the first time that he met Yelbi. “The first time saw him, he was reading a Wikipedia page in French on the computer at the shelter.”The moment was indicative of Yelbi’s thirst for knowledge, Ganong says. “He was always very determined. He knew he wanted to get a better education.”At the age of seven, Yelbi, and his family left Cote d’Ivoire for Strasbourg, France. Upon entering the French lycée system—the last stage in Frane’s secondary-education system—Yelbi pushed himself to take as many baccalauréat classes as possible while maintaining his hobby, basketball.But, the limitations of the French education system threatened to put a hold on Yelbi’s ambitions. With an overburdened network of public universities, the French system offers fewer openings than the much larger network in the United States. Yelbi adds that in France admissions are oftentimes more influenced by factors like geographic distribution and family connections than academic performance.After completing his education in France, Yelbi accepted an offer to play as a fifth-year student on the basketball team at the Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Mass. From there, he hoped to apply to an American university.“That’s why I was playing basketball 100 percent and going to school at the highest level I could,” he says.Yelbi is hesitant to discuss details of his time at Notre Dame. He says that he prefers to focus on his life after entering the HSHS. But Ganong says that at Notre Dame, Yelbi received little support for his college aspirations. “Even though he’s got a lot of drive, he didn’t always know where to direct it,” Ganong says. Upon his arrival at HSHS, Yelbi, with the help of Ganong and other Harvard volunteers, began what has been a year-long process of applying as a transfer student to a dozen American colleges.In the spring of 2008, they began the work of crafting a successful application package. Sam Bakkila ’11-’12, who worked at the shelter over the summer, helped to prepare Yelbi to take the SATs and the TOEFL, a standardized exam for students whose second language is English. Lauren M. White ’11, a volunteer at the shelter and a member of The Crimson’s business department, wrote his peer recommendations. White, Adam S. Travis ’10, and Akshata Kadagathur ’11, also read and revised Yelbi’s essays.Meanwhile, Ganong and Yelbi spent Sunday afternoons in the Science Center, working through application and financial aid forms.On Oct. 29—“D-Day,” as Ganong calls it—he and Yelbi laid out the 12 applications on the floor of his Adams dorm room and painstakingly checked them for factual inaccuracies. The next day, the applications were sent out, and Yelbi began the long wait for responses. OVERCOMING DIFFICULTIESWith one hurdle temporarily surmounted, Yelbi is still faced the brutal difficulties of everyday life as a young, homeless student bracing for a rapidly approaching winter season.Yelbi’s daily routine requires that he negotiate the varied network of emergency homeless shelters in the Boston area, nearly all of which allow only short-term stays. And especially with the impending cold and the deepening financial crisis, shelters are forced to turn away more and more homeless individuals and families.Between his time at HSHS—which limits guests to two-week stays and requires a one week lapse before the guest is allowed to return—Yelbi moved between the Salvation Army shelter in Central Square and friends’ houses.In his search for a stable home, Yelbi printed letters that explained his situation and requested help, and placed them in mailboxes and churches in the surrounding suburbs. He received no responses.Yet Yelbi says that he remains hopeful despite these challenges. “If you want to go somewhere, then never take a no [for an answer],” he says. “Obstacles are made to be overcome.”When faced with the prospect of homelessness after his graduation from Notre Dame, his mother offered him the chance to return home, but Yelbi refused. “My mother knew my situation, and she’s supportive,” Yelbi says. “But she knew that for me to succeed [I needed to] confront the reality.”“Just go into the shelter, it’s ok,” he recalls her saying. “It’s not your country, there’s nothing to be ashamed of.”“I don’t want to go back to France because I want my mother to be proud of me and my brothers to look up to me as a model,” Yelbi explains. “So what [would it] be if I go back with nothing? My brothers wouldn’t respect me anymore.”Yelbi has managed to juggle his enrollment at Bunker Hill Community College, taking classes in Biology, while working at least 30 hours a week.Nicole E. Guilmette, a professor of science and engineering at Bunker Hill, helped Yelbi work on his applications.She says she was initially surprised to see him in so many different offices on campus within the space of a single day. “One day, I ran into Max four times at Bunker Hill—at his four different jobs,” she says.Yelbi considers the work as part of a “journey of giving back.” He is now an English as a Second Language tutor, a mentor for new students, and a math tutor for disabled students.LOOKING FORWARD, ANXIOUSLYIn the weeks after he sent his applications, three of the 12 schools that Yelbi applied to informed him that they would not be able to offer him financial aid as an international student, and as a result, could not admit him through their transfer program.Despite these early disappointments, Ganong says that Yelbi remains hopeful. “He handles failure better than anyone I know, in the sense that when he fails, he says ‘Okay, time to push on.’”On Nov. 30, Ganong rifled through his campus mailbox where he has been receiving Yelbi’s college mail. Intermixed with a number of promotional college packets, Ganong found a thin envelope from Hamilton College in New York, ne of the institutions to whic Yelbi had applied.Ganong says that he had to contain his excitement until Yelbi arrived later that day. They opened the envelope together to find that it contained a letter of acceptance along with an offer of a full scholarship.“I was jumping around the room—I tripped and almost broke my roommate’s laptop,” Ganong said. “Max was screaming with joy, he called his sister and was almost crying; it was an incredible moment.”Much has changed since Yelbi first came to the United States in the hopes of playing basketball professionally.“I was kind of arrogant—I was a recruit for the [basketball] team,” he says.He now says that he hopes to go to medical school and “use the knowledge I get from God to serve people.”“I try to be humble,” Yelbi says, “Money makes people feel secure, but one day if something happens to them, they will realize, that’s not what makes their life meaningful.”—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom can be reached at emdussom@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Gordon Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 3:36 p.m. on Saturday, an inbound Red Line train rolled into Harvard Station, holding a number of people wearing no pants. Others looked on with surprise at the spectacle of boxers, briefs and panties. The half-naked riders were participating in the event “No Pants on January 10, 2008,” hosted by The Boston Society of Spontaneity.
“No Pants,” open to all, began at the Alewife station at 3 p.m. There, a crowd gathered of roughly 100 people, mostly college students from throughout the city, including a number from Harvard. 
Pantless participants broke themselves up into informal groups, which were assigned stops at which to undress and exit the train. Riders then waited at the stop and boarded the  next red line train to pass, momentarily making a spectacle. 
Tellingly, most of the event was confined to Cambridge and Somerville: the pantsless crowd rode from Alewife to Park Street and back, where they redressed.
Some of the participants saw a deeper meaning in the event—at least to some extent. 
“No Pants Boston inserts something into the culture, something that’s not usually there,” said Michael A. Baskin ’11, who participated in No Pants 2008, the first year it was held in this city. “It doesn’t have a message, but it gives people a story,” 
This event, like all those held by Boston SOS, had no cause. According to organization founder James Cobalt, “No Pants” is a social experiment to see how people will react to the unexpected in a very mundane environment.
“It’s like we said, ‘What would happen if?’” said Cobalt. “Most people just don’t really notice.”
The half-naked riders received more than just looks and giggles from others commuters. Some snapped pictures, while others questioned the omission. Participants were instructed to answer these queries with nonchalant lies. 
“I said I was going snowboarding and I had way less wind resistance and better powder without pants,” said Lila Shreiber ’12.  
“Pants were totally last season,” Rebecca Cohen ’12 told questioners. “When I got up this morning, I knew that today just wasn’t the day to wear pants.”
According to its Web site, the Boston Society of Spontaneity is a “group of friends” who stage events throughout the city, using a combination of “guerilla theater and outright silliness.” 
It is currently on its way to becoming a recognized non-profit. Other recent antics held by the group included its Caroling Choir, which performed Christmas parodies such as “Silent (But Deadly) Night.” 
Boston SOS It is an offshoot of New York based Improv Everywhere, best know for staging its “freeze” event in Grand Central Station.  According to Cobalt, future plans involve guerilla gardening, or renovating public places under cover of night.
Word about the event was spread largely through its Facebook group and the Boston SOS’s mailing list. 
Last year, more extensive media coverage made for a better turnout, though Cobalt said too much participation would have diminished the event, making participants seem less like anomalies and more like the norm. 
“I still don’t think that too many people would ruin No Pants,” Cobalt said. “It’s just too silly and too much fun.”

The Harvard men’s hockey team (4-11-3, 4-6-3 ECAC) could not stop Yale from maintaining its undefeated ECAC record, as poor fundamentals and a lack of focus led to a 6-2 loss against a tough Bulldogs (11-4-0, 6-2 ECAC) squad on Saturday night at Bright Hockey Center.With Harvard’s 1989 team back in Cambridge to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Crimson’s last NCAA Championship, three Bulldog goals within the first 10 minutes of the opening period put the game out of reach.Yale’s fast and physical team pressured the Crimson all over the ice and exposed problems with Harvard’s ability to execute the fundamentals.“I think Yale’s speed and skill and our inability to make good plays with the puck and to skate at the same level, that was the issue for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.Yale’s Billy Blasé responded to several Crimson attacks in the second half of the first period, including one deflection that shut down a slapshot from freshman Alex Killhorn at 15:19 in the first and another that stifled junior Alex Biega from point blank range. Yale’s defenders rushed Harvard’s offense enough to limit Harvard’s quality shots on goal in the first, though the Crimson would finish with 13 shots in the first period and 34 shots on the game. But Yale’s hustling and scrappy defense kept the puck in the Harvard zone for most of the game and forced Crimson to rush looks and fight for the puck in the corners when the team did manage to mount attacks in the Yale zone.The Bulldogs’ aggressive play drew seven Harvard penalties on the night, including several in the second period, interrupting the momentum that the Crimson struggled to build all night. Yale successfully killed all six of Harvard’s power-play attempts.“Yale’s a good team. They always play us hard, especially this year. They’re very skilled and they work hard all over the ice,” co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “I give them credit. They outworked us. When we fell behind, they didn’t get cocky, and they didn’t get away from their game.”Fraser scored his third and fourth goals of the season and provided the only offensive spark for Harvard all night. His first goal put the Crimson on the scoreboard at 4:52 in the second period when Fraser fired a shot from the slot that beat Blasé on the left side inside the post.The co-captain’s rush up the ice at the end of the third period resulted in a wrist shot that sailed past Blasé top shelf at 19:10 to add a measure of respectability to the final score.Ultimately, finding a sense of confidence is elusive for Harvard, as the team has not won a game since Nov. 15.“I think a lot of guys are gripping their sticks pretty tight out there and seem pretty nervous about making mistakes that might cost us some goals,” Fraser said.The night saw Donato replace Hoyle with junior John Riley at 15:06 in the second after a turnover in the Crimson zone allowed Mark Arcobello—who also notched two assists—ample time and space to fire a wrist shot top shelf over Hoyle’s shoulders.Riley finished with 15 saves and gave up Yale’s final goal when Brian O’Neill’s rush allowed the puck to slip over the line in a commotion that knocked down Riley in the process.This goal only served to spark Harvard’s frustration. The extracurriculars began with some shoving in front of Yale’s net that sent junior forward Doug Rogers and Yale’s Mark Arcobello to the locker room with 10-minute game-misconduct penalties at 16:50.Less than three minutes later, junior Chad Morin would also take a 10-minute misconduct for a shoving match in front of the Crimson’s bench. As the team looks towards its next game against Dartmouth on Jan. 25, Harvard hopes that history may be on the verge of repeating itself, as the reversal of the Crimson’s fortunes last season started with a win over the Big Green.“We’ve got to play with confidence out here, and I think we have to get back to the simple game,” Fraser said. —Staff writer Robert T.

Harvard just cannot get started.With Yale scoring three unanswered goals in the first 10 minutes of last Saturday night’s game, the Harvard men’s hockey team’s 6-2 loss increased its winless streak to 12 games. The Bulldogs (12-4-0, 7-2-0 ECAC) outshot Harvard (4-12-3, 4-7-3 ECAC) 16-13 in the opening frame and kept the shooting advantage until the final frame, when the Crimson eked out 13 shots over Yale’s nine.“They come out a lot faster and a lot more determined than us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “They’re a tough enough team as it is, but if you spot them three goals in a five-minute window or so in the first period, then it doesn’t turn into much of a hockey game.”In five of the Crimson’s last nine losses, the opposing team secured the lead in the first frame.“It takes the life right out of these guys, no matter what sport, if you fall behind early,” senior co-captain Jimmy Fraser said. “It’s tough to come back, and unfortunately that was the case again tonight.”On the other hand, when Harvard has led at the first intermission—for example, against Clarkson, RPI, and Quebec-Trois-Rivieres this season—it has gone on to win the contest.ANOTHER PLAY BITES THE DUSTAfter a lackluster start, the Crimson seemed poised for a comeback in the middle frame. Holding a one man advantage at the beginning of the period, Harvard picked up some momentum on a power play. Three minutes later, Fraser ripped one past Bulldog goalie Billy Blasé to put the Crimson on the board and narrow the point deficit to 3-1.But as soon as things seemed to be going Harvard’s way, an untimely high sticking penalty turned the game back over to Yale, as the Bulldogs knocked another one in on the power play, putting them ahead, 4-1.“As soon as we seem to get something going and get some penetration down in their zone like we did in the first couple of minutes of the second period there, something happens, either a penalty or an icing or something that goes the wrong way,” Fraser said. “We talk a lot in the locker room that bounces come from hard work, and you have to create your own luck. Again, penalties cost us in key situations and unfortunately killed the momentum that we were trying to get going.”In the last five minutes of the game, Yale was hit with back-to-back penalties, giving the Crimson a powerplay for nearly three minutes. But what could have been another chance for Harvard to close the scoring gap was wasted, as a misconduct call on both teams interrupted the flow of the game and deflated the Crimson’s offensive drive.Fraser scored again with under a minute on the clock, but Harvard’s attempts to regroup ended up being too little, too late.HE’S ALL RILED UPJunior goalie John Riley notched 15 saves in his 25-minute relief performance. Coming in late in the second period with the Crimson down by four, Riley deflected a number of shots to limit the Bulldogs to one goal-against.“I thought John came into a tough situation and played very well,” Donato said.Yale’s best chance to boost its lead came midway through the third period, as Bulldog Matt Nelson accepted a pass behind the net and released a fast wraparound shot right on frame.Foiling Nelson’s efforts, Riley blocked the attempt in a replay-worthy save.The Bulldogs managed to sneak one goal past the junior netminder with 4:04 left in the final frame, but the play was contested by Harvard, as it seemed that Yale’s Brian O’Neill had charged the goalie. The referees reviewed the play, and though O’Neill was sent to the box for the infraction, the Yale goal was allowed.Riley now has a team-high save percentage of .898 for the season, with 53 saves and six goals allowed. His career save percentage is .906, topping both Hoyle and Carroll’s percentages.Freshman Matt Hoyle, who served as the Crimson’s starting goalie for most of the season, was pulled after the Bulldogs’ fifth goal of the night. Hoyle made 17 saves against Yale.“I don’t want to minimalize Yale’s goals on just a goaltender basis,” Donato said. “But like a lot of parts of our game, it’s one that we have to be better at in order to be successful.”AROUND THE BOARDSThe loss against Yale is Harvard’s first ECAC loss at home since the game against Clarkson one year ago today. The Golden Knights were last year’s regular season ECAC champions...Blueliner Brian McCafferty has been selected as one of the candidates for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS award...After last season’s 10-game winless streak, the Crimson rebounded in its post-reading period match against Dartmouth. Harvard faces the Big Green when it returns from a two-week break, at Hanover...The Crimson’s 1989 NCAA Championship team, which includes Donato, who was named the Most Outstanding Player, was honored tonight on the ice at the intermission.—Staff writer Courtney D.

After falling twice on the road last weekend, the men’s hockey team (4-10-3, 4-5-3 ECAC) walked onto the ice at Bright Hockey Center on Friday night still craving its first victory of 2009. Brown (1-9-4, 1-4-4) left the Crimson still hungry, however, by evening the score 1-1 with five minutes to go and holding on through an intense overtime to force a tie.Although Harvard pelted the Bears with 51 shots on goal, Brown goaltender Daniel Rosen held strong and earned a .980 save percentage through 65 minutes of play.Penalties ultimately proved to be the Crimson’s downfall; Harvard was forced to contend with four Brown power plays during the third period, fending off the first three before coughing up the tying goal after the final penalty. The Bears lead the ECAC in converting power plays, scoring a goal in one out of every five opportunities.“When you [face] a team with a good power play and give them four chances in the third period alone and overtime, you’re really playing Russian roulette,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.Working off an interference call against junior Ian Tallett at 14:55 in the third, Brown swarmed around the Crimson goal and pushed the puck in amidst a barrage of shots to lift the score to 1-1.“There were some screens,” freshman goaltender Matt Hoyle said. “It shot through and I never saw it. Just got unlucky.”Aside from the one that got away, Hoyle made 28 saves on the night.With only five minutes to recover the lead, the Crimson regrouped and attempted to rack up another tally after a Brown penalty. Despite numerous scoring opportunities, no one could provide the answer for Harvard and the score remained tied as the penalty box doors opened.During the final minute of regulation time, the Crimson assembled an offensive front that made Rosen work double time. Firing shots off left and right, Harvard desperately tried to put one past the Bears defense, but the squad again failed to regain the lead.“There were quite a few rebounds that looked like we were in a great position to take advantage of,” Donato said.As the clock ticked down from five minutes, Harvard started overtime by counting down from two minutes after yet another penalty called against the Crimson, this one on freshman Alex Killorn. Relying on stout defensive play, Harvard escaped the power play situation and received one final opportunity to end the game in its favor. Two Brown penalties primed the Crimson with a highly favorable five-on-three setup.With 22.1 seconds to go, Harvard took aim at the Brown goal and made its final attempts but ultimately could not convert in the limited time.Although play certainly escalated as the game drew to a close, it took some time for the game to develop. After the first 20 minutes, no team had clearly taken control. the Crimson led Brown in shots on goal 16-11, but the Bears successfully staved off two intense Harvard assaults in power play situations. Rosen saved shots from all distances, including a series of close-up potshots from freshman Daniel Moriarty during the second power play.But Rosen could not keep the defensive pace for long, as another Crimson power play would soon prove. With 18:20 to go in the second and with a five-on-four advantage, senior Steve Rolecek drove the puck up on the left and let it loose from the center of the faceoff ring. Rosen swatted unsuccessfully and the puck found the back of the net, granting Harvard a 1-0 lead.The Crimson also flexed its defensive muscle throughout the second, depriving the Bears of scoring opportunities, stopping breakaways short and keeping freshman goalie Matt Hoyle’s workload to a minimum. The Bears managed only four shots on goal in the second.“We need to bring the same intensity [Saturday],” Hoyle said, referring to Saturday’s matchup against Yale.—Staff writer Emmett Kistler can be reached at ekistler@fas.harvard.edu.

And so it begins: yet another fight-to-the-finish, nothing-comes-easy Ivy season for the Harvard women’s basketball team. 
After finishing above .500 in non-conference play for the first time since the 2004-2005 campaign, the Crimson (7-7, 0-1 Ivy) saw that the road to its third straight league title would be anything but a breeze. Co-Ivy champion Dartmouth (4-9, 1-0 Ivy), which knocked Harvard out of postseason play last year, outmuscled the Crimson en route to a 59-55 win Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion. 
For the second year in a row, the Big Green beat Harvard in the league opener in Cambridge and began the dogfight that begins at the season’s tipoff and often runs until the final buzzer. Dartmouth led by as many as 10 points in the second half before the Crimson whittled the deficit down to three with 12 seconds to play.  
But Harvard was unable to get a shot off on its final possession, turning over both the ball and the game on an errant pass attempt. 
“It’s a great lesson for us to learn,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “We can’t take anything for granted from now on.”
Offense on the block was the difference-maker Saturday, when a physical Big Green frontcourt held Crimson forwards senior Katie Rollins and sophomore Emma Markley in check. Rollins chipped in a solid eight points and six boards, but Markley, the team’s leading scorer at 14 points a contest, shot just 1-for-4 from the field for two points. Dartmouth center Darcy Rose and sisters Brittney and Margaret Smith doubled the forwards on every touch. 
“Emma and Katie probably had the worst games of their careers,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “[Dartmouth] doubled them early—that’s a great strategy, but they outworked us.”
“It’s tough passing out of a double or triple team and as a team, we didn’t do a great job of helping [the forwards] out and making ourselves open,” Finelli added. “It was frustrating because they really took us out of our game. We had to adjust the way we played.”
It didn’t help that co-captain Emily Tay, normally the team’s sparkplug on offense, was limited by illness. Tay started the game and turned in impressive numbers—12 points on 5-for-9 shooting from the floor—but was not her playmaking self (no assists, two turnovers). 
“We all knew we had to step up and play without her, and I think we did step into our roles,” said freshman point guard Brogan Berry. “Just not well enough to win the game.”
Delaney-Smith compared her team’s play without its star to its performance last month in California, when Finelli missed a game due to illness.
“Emotionally, the same thing happened to us today,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everyone panicked. That doesn’t need to happen.”
Berry did her part in her first taste of Ivy play, turning in 20 points on 6-for-12 shooting from the field (including 4-for-6 from three-point range). 
The rookie ran the point with poise during the Crimson’s comeback attempt, but came up empty-handed on Harvard’s final possession when Rose shot the lane on her pass and came away with it as time wound down.
“We had designed the play and it just kind of broke down,” Berry said. “It was an unlucky pass when they got in the lane.”
“It doesn’t really mean anything except that it was one play in the game of forty minutes,” Finelli said of the final possession. “It doesn’t dictate a win or loss. [Berry] should keep doing what she’s doing.”
“What she’s doing” included carrying the Crimson’s stagnant offense early on in the game, scoring seven of Harvard’s first nine points. Neither Harvard nor the Big Green looked sharp offensively, and the teams traded turnovers and missed jumpers in the opening minutes. At the 15-minute mark, the score was just 4-0 in favor of Dartmouth; at halftime, it was 20-19, with Harvard barely the better of two stalling attacks.
The good news for the Crimson was that star Big Green guard Koren Schram shot just 1-for-10 for two points in the first half, with Berry allowing her few good looks at the basket.
The bad news?
Schram caught fire after the break, hitting 4-for-7 from the floor and winding up with 17 points in the game. 
Brittney Smith complemented a physical defensive effort down low with a double-double (18 points, 11 rebounds). Smith was at perhaps her most aggressive in the final minute, when she and Crimson forward Jackie Alemany received double technical fouls and were separated after jockeying for position on an inbounds play. 
“Our focus was to shut them down,” Finelli said, referring to Schram and Smith. “But I think we lost sight of that in the second half, especially when things got a little tighter in terms of scoring. Those breakdowns really hurt us.”
The Crimson now begins its break for final exams before continuing on the Ivy play on the road Jan. 30 at Penn (7 p.m. tipoff) and Jan. 31 at Princeton (6 p.m. tipoff).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After junior Jeremy Lin starred in Harvard’s first-ever win over a ranked team, he was bound to garner more attention against Ivy League opponents. Keeping the game close on Saturday at Leede Arena, Dartmouth did everything possible to keep the ball out of Lin’s hands at the end of the game. No matter, because Lin is not Harvard’s only clutch guard. Freshman Oliver McNally hit two baskets in the last minute and a half, including the last bucket with 12.4 seconds remaining, to seal the game, 63-62, for the Crimson (9-6, 1-0 Ivy). It was the Ivy League opener for both teams, and the Big Green fell to 2-11 overall (0-1 Ivy) in a game that it led by as much as ten points in the first half.“We got a big confidence boost from the win,” Harvard captain Andrew Pusar said.  “We’re on an emotional high from the game at BC, so that was tough, but our ability to grind out a win when we’re not playing our best is a big deal. It shows we’ve improved on the road.”Harvard was not playing in its usual form in the first half. While it gave up only 17 turnovers in the previous two games combined, the Crimson amassed 12 turnovers in the first half alone on Saturday. Because of that, Harvard only led once in the first period, 34-32, despite making 53-percent of its buckets.Dartmouth jumped to an early lead thanks to good shooting and Crimson mistakes. When Harvard notched its first tie at 14, with 12:48 left to go in the first period, Dartmouth responded with five unanswered points, closed out by an Alex Barnett dunk. A layup by sophomore forward Clive Weeden with 9:15 left pushed the Big Green lead to double-digits with the score at 28-18, but it did not remain so for long.Still trailing 30-20 two minutes later, Harvard capitalized on some Dartmouth fouls, making all five of its free-throw attempts in three minutes, including an and-one layup play by Pusar, in a 9-0 run. Fouls by the Big Green during the entire first period countered its hot shooting and allowed the Crimson to keep it close. Harvard ended up shooting 14 of 16 free throws in the first half alone, accounting for nearly half of its first-half points.“We always have a hard time playing there,” Lin said. “We felt we had more talent than they did, we had a better racket, but it’s hard. It was just a great win.”The second half was a see-saw ride, with nine lead changes and no team ever leading by double-digits. The Crimson jumped to an early period lead that was quickly stifled by a 9-0 Dartmouth run that brought the Big Green lead to 48-44, its largest margin for the rest of the game.A 57-53 Dartmouth lead was eclipsed when freshman forward Keith Wright made two shots from the charity stripe and Pusar hit a three-pointer, but a three-point play from Big Green junior Elgin Fitzgerald put Dartmouth on top again, 60-59, with only two minutes to play. Lin drove the ball down the court, dishing it to McNally, who pulled up for a bucket from the elbow, making it 61-60 Harvard.Big Green star Barnett countered with a jump shot of his own to give Dartmouth a one-point edge with 33 seconds remaining, and Harvard ran the shot clock down as far as it could before McNally made his go-ahead runner shot, putting the Crimson up 63-62. The game came down to the last shot, however, and Barnett put up an off-balance 14-foot jumper in an attempt to draw a foul, but it came up short and the only whistle he got was the second period buzzer.“One of the things we’ve really benefited from is that [McNally]’s a compeititor, a tenacious team guy,” Pusar said. “He’s always team-first and he’s always about winning.”Harvard improved its sloppy play in the second half, only giving up five turnovers, but better Dartmouth defense led to a poorer shooting percentage, as the Crimson made only 39 percent of its second-period buckets, including 3-10 from long range. Both teams knew who the stars were, and both teams made sure to lock those players down on defense. Big Green senior Alex Barnett, who is averaging 18.5 points per game, was held to only 9 points, and Lin, averaging 17.9 points, managed just 10. Both players found a way to make a difference anyway and each led his team in both rebounds and assists. Lin notched his first double-double of the season with his impressive rebound effort, grabbing 11 total boards.Pusar shined for the Crimson, notching a game-high 19 points on 8-11 shooting. Only junior Dan Biber scored double-digits for Dartmouth, putting up 10 points on 4-5 shooting.Dartmouth will play two more home games before a rematch at Harvard, while the Crimson take a 13-day break for finals.—Staff writer Paul T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Needing a three to even the score and force overtime, the Crimson’s freshman point guard Brogan Berry fought off the press, and pushed the ball down the right side of the court. But with Berry looking to feed one of her sharp shooting co-captains, Dartmouth players swarmed her passing lanes. Somewhere in the traffic, the ball popped out of Berry’s hands and into those of the Big Green’s Darcy Rose.
“It was just not a good last possession,” Berry said.
The end was anything but fitting for the Ivy League’s newest star. In her first ever conference game, Berry looked more like a seasoned veteran than a freshman, and, on the day, was probably the best player on the floor. 
“She’s done a phenomenal job as our point guard,” co-captain Niki Finelli said. “Everyone’s going to make mistakes, and the ball just happened to fall out of her hands.”
Berry finished with a game- and career-high 20 points on 6-for-12 shooting, including four three-pointers.
“She is one of the best point guards I’ve ever seen in the league,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Certainly she’s as good as any guard that’s ever played here.”
It was clear very early on that it would be a long day for the Crimson forwards. Combine the frontcourt’s struggles with the fact that co-captain Emily Tay was not playing at 100 percent, and you get many questions as to where Harvard would find its offensive spark. 
The Crimson got off to a sloppy, ice-cold start, failing to score for nearly six minutes. But when it finally got on the board, Berry led the charge, scoring seven of the team’s first nine points.
Berry went into halftime with 10 points on 4-for-7 shooting. The rest of the team combined for 10 points on 4-for-17 shooting.
With Dartmouth on a 6-0 run to start the second half, Berry hit a big three to answer. A couple minutes later, she showed her hustle by making a great save on a ball going out of bounds, allowing Finelli to hit the floor and retain possession. 
With Harvard down five and under 30 seconds to play, Berry penetrated the lane and was fouled. Desperately needing two points to have any chance, all the pressure was on her shoulders at the line. Refusing to show any signs of her young age, Berry coolly hit both free throws. 
Berry may have led all scorers, but her work on the defensive end of the floor against the Big Green’s star Koren Schram was equally impressive. Berry was assigned the tough job of matching up with the first-team all-Ivy senior. 
“We knew [Schram] was a great shooter, so my job was to not let her have any open shots out on the perimeter, and deny her the ball,” Berry said.
In the game plan, Delaney-Smith showed her willingness to put her freshman up against an opponent’s most talented player. 
For her part, Berry repaid her coach’s confidence, holding Schram to just two points on 1-for-10 shooting in the first half. While Schram got hot after the break, Berry played her tough throughout.
Berry has already been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week four times, but this was the first chance for a conference rival to see her up close.
On a night when her backcourt partner was sick and her forwards ineffective, Berry showed once again that she could step up and lead the team.
While her efforts may have come up just short on Saturday, Berry’s performance in her first Ivy League test bodes very well for the future of Harvard women’s basketball.

While a complete team effort was the recipe for success for the Harvard women’s hockey team last season, the Crimson did have its stars, and perhaps none shined brighter than then-junior Sarah Vaillancourt and then-sophomore goaltender Christina Kessler.Vaillancourt was honored as the best player in the nation with the Patty Kazmaier Award, while Kessler set school records with a 1.06 goals against average and a .952 save percentage.Both players have remained solid this season, but the dominant performances that seemed to be the norm for the pair a year ago have appeared less frequently.That is, until this weekend.A Vaillancourt hat trick led Harvard (8-7-3, 8-4-2 ECAC) to a 5-3 victory over Brown (3-12-1, 2-7-0) in Providence on Friday while Kessler was rock solid between the posts in New Haven under heavy fire from a relentless Yale offense, consistently denying the Bulldogs (7-9-0, 3-6-0) en route to a 1-0 shutout.The sweep gives the Crimson positive momentum heading into exam period, which will keep Harvard out of action for nearly three weeks.“It’s a great feeling for us,” Kessler said. “It was a good way to end our play.”HARVARD 1, YALE 0Tough, physical play and a steady barrage of shots on both sides of the ice characterized the Crimson’s 1-0 win over the Bulldogs.Harvard and Yale combined for 14 penalties, ensuring a busy day in the net for both goalies and no shortage of power-play opportunities for either team. But strong play from the Crimson and Bulldog penalty kill units and stellar showings from Kessler and Yale netminder Jackie Snikeris rendered both teams’ efforts with the man advantage fruitless—Harvard was 0-for-5 on the power play while the Bulldogs went 0-for-7.Snikeris frustrated the Crimson all afternoon, stopping 24 Harvard shots.But Harvard finally broke through 11:38 into the second period, despite being shorthanded.Junior defenseman Kathryn Farni broke up a Bulldogs power-play effort, stealing the puck and charging into the Yale zone. Farni made the most of her breakaway opportunity, threading a shot under Snikeris’ glove. The puck bounced off the post and into the back of the net.“It was a perfect shot,” Kessler said. “The goalie didn’t give up much room.”While Snikeris was good, Kessler was perfect.The junior notched a season-high 32 saves, withstanding a fierce Bulldogs offensive attack to complete the shutout.“Chrisitna Kessler had one of her best games of the season today,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We needed her to.”HARVARD 5, BROWN 3The Crimson jumped out to a quick 3-1 lead on Friday, but the Bears came charging back in the first half of the third period to tie the game.“It shouldn’t have been as close as it was,” Stone said. “We let them back in.”With its lead gone and the momentum slipping out of its favor, Harvard needed a boost.Enter Vaillancourt.The tri-captain responded with a pair of power-play goals, giving her a hat trick and Harvard a 5-3 lead that would prove insurmountable.A minute after Brown forced the tie, Vaillancourt received the puck from tri-captain Jenny Brine and flicked it past Bears goalie Nicole Stock to give the Crimson a 5-4 lead.Brown kept the game close, keeping its hopes alive until the final minute, when Vaillancourt struck again, wristing a goal from the left side of the net with under 30 seconds left in the third frame.“She’s been a great player for us throughout the whole season and been a great leader,” Kessler said. “Yesterday was proof of her talent.”While Vaillancourt led the Harvard attack, her linemates joined her in the scoring binge as well.Brine and senior Sarah Wilson scored the Crimson’s first two goals, giving Harvard an early advantage.“We kept it simple,” Stone said. “We let the puck do the work. ”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

Sharing the pool with an Ivy League opponent for the first time in over a month, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (6-0, 4-0 Ivy) gave the rest of the league something to fear. The Crimson trounced the visiting Penn Quakers (3-3, 2-3) 213-85 this past Saturday.Harvard won 14 of the day’s 16 events, completely dominating its rival Quakers.“I think we did what we needed to get done,” said junior distance stand-out Alex Meyer, who placed first in the 400-yard IM. “When everyone’s pretty stressed out with exams and quite a workload, it’s hard to come to practice and make room for swimming—to swim well like this given the circumstances is pretty good.”In addition to the obstacle of reading period time strain, the Crimson’s feat is made even more remarkable by the fact that many of the Harvard swimmers were racing in “off-events,” ones that they normally do not compete in.“It was good to be able to branch out from what we’ve all been normally swimming,” senior Bill Jones said.Jones, who usually swims the 100- and 200-yard butterfly, was one of the Crimson’s two swimmers placing first in more than one individual event. Jones captured his signature 100-yard butterfly with a time of 50.34, and also added a new event to his gold-medal repertoire, placing first in the 200-yard freestyle with a 1:41.22 swim.Sophomore backstroker Jordan Diekema also posted two individual wins in the 100-yard freestyle and 100-yard backstroke, touching the wall in 47.13 and 50.32, respectively.“I accomplished what I needed to accomplish based on what my coach told me for today,” Diekema said. “I was pretty happy with how I swam.”There was one rough patch disrupting Harvard’s day of smooth sailing, however. In the 1000-yard freestyle event, two of the Crimson’s top swimmers were disqualified for ending in the wrong lane. Meyer and senior Eric Lynch, who posted times good enough to claim the top-two spots in the event, were eliminated from scoring for this blunder.“That’s kind of a rookie mistake and slightly embarrassing,” Meyer said. “I just looked up the heat sheet and I was going to tell everyone what lane they were in and forgot my own.”The 1000-yard freestyle was not a total loss for Harvard, however, with the silver lining to this lone cloud coming in the form of sophomore Blake Lewkowitz. Lewkowitz barely edged out Penn’s top swimmer in the event, finishing with a time of 9:35.54 and capturing the top spot for the Crimson.Apart from individual races, Harvard shone in the relay events as well, placing first in both of the day’s contests. The 200-yard medley relay team of Diekem, Jones, junior Simone Melillo and senior co-captain David Guernsey posted a winning 1:32.45 finish.The 200-yard freestyle relay team also captured first for the Crimson. Freshmen Nicholas Tan and Graham Frankel, junior Rick McKellar and sophomore Eric Taylor finished with a 1:26.46 time.Harvard seeks to build off of this weekend’s victory as it reaches the culmination of its dual meet season: the men’s team faces Brown in two weeks followed by the crucial Harvard-Yale-Princeton matchup the following Saturday.“We just need to stay at it, keep training hard and keep mentally tough,” Diekema said. “We need to be able to keep our momentum up and just be ready to race.”With the focus already on the HYP meet, which will likely decide the Ivy League title, the Crimson swimmers are gearing up to face their biggest rival, annual powerhouse Princeton. In addition to physical training, Harvard will also need to prepare both mentally and emotionally for the decisive contest.“We need to have a good, emotionally-positive next three weeks leading up to the [HYP] meet so that we’re confident going into it,” Meyer said. “They’ve also posted some pretty fast times this season, and as long as we don’t let that get under our skin too much, “I know we can beat them,” he added.Harvard will be back in action on January 24th, when it welcomes Brown to Blodgett pool.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

Another weekend, another win for the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team.The Crimson (4-0, 4-0 Ivy) dominated Penn (1-3, 1-3), 207-91, in dual meet action Saturday at Blodgett Pool.Once again led by sophomores Kate Mills and Katherine Pickard, Harvard took 13 of the 15 contested events and swept the top three places in eight of them.“I thought we swam very well for where we are in our training,” Crimson coach Stephanie Morawski said. “They did a great job and were able to keep the focus on their swimming.”Harvard got things started with a 1-2 finish in the 200-yard medley relay and never looked back.Sophomore Christine Kaufmann took the meet’s first individual event in style. After touching the wall first in the 1000-yard freestyle, Kaufmann continued on to the 1650-yard mark as an exhibition event.She clocked in at 16:36.85 for the mile, a lifetime best.“She broke 16:40, which is a pretty big barrier in the event,” Clarke said. “It was an impressive swim because she’s been training really hard, and it’s really exciting to see her have this breakthrough right now.”Clarke, freshman Catherine Zagroba, and junior Katie Faulkner also competed in the grueling event.“We haven’t had that many opportunities to swim the mile, and it is an event at Ivies,” Morawski said. “I thought all four of them did a great job.”Harvard was dominant in the freestyle all afternoon, sweeping all five events.Mills won at both the 100-yard and 200-yard distances, recording times of 52.75 and 1:49.92, respectively.Freshman Kristi Korsberg was first in the 500-yard freestyle, while Pickard led freshman Monica Burgos and sophomore Laura Murray in the sweep of the 50-yard event. Pickard’s second individual win came in the 200-yard breaststroke, an unusual event for the sophomore. She clocked in at 2:25.33, followed by freshmen Victoria Pratt and Alicia Lightbourne.The Crimson’s lineup was full of surprises, as many swimmers stepped outside their comfort zones to compete in unfamiliar events against a weaker opponent. “It can’t just be about the times you go, it has to be about racing,” Morawski said. “When it’s a completely different event, you have nothing to lose.”Harvard also recorded sweeps of the 100-yard backstroke and the 200-yard individual medley. Sophomore Katy Hinkle led the way in the backstroke, finishing in 59.81, and freshman Meghan Leddy won the IM in 2:07.76, nearly four seconds ahead of senior runner-up Linnea Sundberg. The Quakers’ only wins on the afternoon came in the 100-yard breaststroke and the 1-meter diving event.In the breaststroke, freshman Helen Pitchik finished strongly but couldn’t overcome a slow start, coming in second to Penn rookie Laura Klick. Lightbourne was third. And despite missing out on the top spot in 1-meter diving, the Crimson took the next five positions. Sophomore Marissa Ash finished just a point out of first place, followed by sophomore Jenny Reese, freshman Leslie Rea, sophomore Anne Taylor and freshman Jessica Stanchfield. Reese handily won the 3-meter diving competition, finishing 25 points ahead of Quaker Melissa Gardel.Additional event winners for Harvard were freshman Hilary Roberts in the 200-yard butterfly, sophomore Kay Foley in the 200-yard backstroke, and junior Natalia Festa in the 100-yard butterfly. The Crimson swam the day’s final event, the 200-yard freestyle relay, as an exhibition, but Harvard’s A team still touched the wall nearly two seconds ahead of Penn’s top entry. Hinkle, Murray, junior Sophie Morgan and Pickard recorded a time of 1:37.65.“Every time we have an opportunity to race, it’s an opportunity to perfect the strategy,” Morawski said. “At the end of the season, we want them to just be focused on the racing, so we need to perfect all those little things now.” After a break for exams, the Crimson will next be in action Jan. 24 at home against Brown.“I think it’s really encouraging that everyone swam so well when they’re under so much stress academically,” Clarke said. “When we have our bigger meets and we can focus more directly on swimming, I think we’ll have some pretty impressive swims.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard track and field team looked to capitalize on the practice available from two out-of-town meets this weekend with the NYU Metro Coaches Invitational on Friday and the Dartmouth Relays in Hanover, N.H yesterday. Snow ultimately kept the team from competing in the latter event, but the Crimson offered some impressive results from the New York meet.“With finals coming up, we wanted to look for some meets that were in close proximity,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I wanted to get the middle runners on the track at the Armory.”Highlighting the Crimson effort, sophomore Hilary May finished first in the women’s 3000-meter run, finishing at 10:05.31. The race marked her first collegiate 3K, as well as her first collegiate win.“The race was actually a really great way to start the season,” May said. “I talked with the coaches before and we decided it would be a good idea to try a different event to get ready for the mile. Jason told me to go for a negative split...make sure my second half was faster than my first half to make sure I’m working on my strength.”Another strong sign coming out of Friday’s meet was rookie Darcy Wilson’s 1:23.07 finish in the men’s 600-meter run. The time earned Wilson a 12th-place finish overall and seventh among collegians.Senior Aishlinn O’Callaghan and freshman Meg Looney finished back-to-back in the women’s 600 at the eighth and ninth spots, respectively. O’Callaghan clocked in 1:37.75, while Looney followed 29 seconds behind at 1:38.04.“The idea was to get their legs spinning,” Saretsky said. “They’re working out well together and pushing each other and I’m excited to see what happens down the road.”Rookie Jeanne Mack also competed in the event, finishing at 1:42.53 for 18th.O’Callaghan, Looney, and Mack also teamed up with senior Jan Ng to place sixth in the women’s 1600 sprint medley with a time of 4:24.59.Despite just limited action over the weekend—further truncated by the inclement weather—Saretsky remains confident with where the squad stands with a full schedule of in-town meets forthcoming.“From wire to wire, we executed the game plan just as we wanted to,” Saretsky said.Harvard has just four meets left before the Indoor Heptagonals, but three of those meets will be at the hometown Gordon Track. The Crimson’s next meet—its only “away” meet—is at the Boston University Track across the river.“The best part is being able to run so much in front of a home crowd,” Saretsky said. “We have a lot of really exciting meets coming up so we hope a lot of people come out to watch.”Heading into the final stretch before Heps, Harvard has to be pleased with what it has in its arsenal. According to the International Association of Athletics Federations, senior high jumper Becky Christensen is currently tied with just four other jumpers as No. 1 high jumper in the world. Christensen is the only representative from the United States.And the Crimson has a solid batch of freshmen to balance out their stalwart roster of veterans. With rookies like Wilson, Looney, Mack, and John Dingus—who won the 500-meter run at the Harvard Open before the break—consequently qualifying for the IC4A Championships, backing up veterans like Christensen, O’Callaghan, and Ng, the Crimson can look forward to a competitive closing stretch to the indoor season.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

Craig Fitzgerald, the director of strength and conditioning at Harvard, who made a name for himself with the remarkable intensity of the workout regimens he designed, will be leaving for a post at the University of South Carolina, he said today.Fitzgerald, who came to Harvard in April, 2005 after a stint as the assistant director of strength and conditioning at the University of Maryland, worked directly with many of the University’s athletic teams, including football, men’s and women’s basketball, wrestling, and men’s tennis. He will serve as the head football strength coach in South Carolina, where he is due to report on Wednesday.“I’m leaving a great group of people, the athletes here,” said Fitzgerald, who interviewed for the job in South Carolina last Friday, and was offered the position on Saturday before accepting yesterday. “These are the top of the tops. I’m just happy I got an opportunity to be with them.”Football captain Carl D. Ehrlich ‘09, whom Fitzgerald informed of his decision earlier today, said that despite Fitzgerald’s attachment to Harvard, the chance to head a strength program in the Southeastern Conference, one of the nation’s most prominent athletic conferences, was simply too good to pass up.“In college football, it’s understood that an opportunity like that is impossible to pass up,” Ehrlich said. “To be the head strength and conditioning coach at an SEC school—that’s being at the top of your industry, so it’s something that is unspoken—that it’s natural that somebody’s going to take that job.”Fitzgerald, who, according to Ehrlich, was renowned for arriving at his office at 5:30 in the morning and working days that ran as long as 15 to 16 hours, was a master motivator who stressed accountability and got results.  “Missing lift is a mistake you make once,” Ehrlich said. “Even being late to lift is a mistake you make once. If one person’s late, then the whole team’s guilty. You have 110 college kids and you tell them they have to be in the weight-room every morning at 6:30 and none of them are late—he managed that.”Senior forward Katie Rollins said the fitness gains realized in Fitzgerald’s work with the women’s basketball team were noticeable.  “When you get to the higher levels of division one college basketball, it’s all about strength and conditioning—can you outstrength and outrun the other team?” Rollins said. “And I think we’ve been able to at least stay with our opponents if not outrun them. It’s always been a strength.“With Fitzgerald gone, assistant strength and conditioning directors Tim Mullen and Dan Perlmutter will be assuming much of the responsibility for keeping Harvard’s athletes on track.  According to Fitzgerald, who made a policy of planning fitness programs a year in advance, the program is in good hands and will be moving “onward and upwards.”“Coach Fitz will be the first to say that hes only a third of the program,” Ehrlich said. “When coach Fitz steps away there will be no letdown, we’ll keep on rolling.”Fitzgerald, who is also noted for overseeing the relocation of the Harvard varsity weightroom in March 2007 from the Murr Center to its current 24,000 square-foot Palmer-Dixon locale—among the nation’s biggest—said that his proudest achievement was the level of attention he and the rest of his small staff were able to give each of Harvard’s 41 teams.“Our mission is inclusion, and we treat everyone as equals,” he said. “Every student has been trained right and trained as well as they can train. Our alpine skiers and fencers and tennis players feel as much attention as our football players.”
