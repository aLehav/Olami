After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cash-strapped, passed over for other transportation projects, and with a completion date decades away, West Station, the MBTA’s new commuter rail station in Allston, faces many challenges. Politicians have now asked Harvard to pay the entire cost of the station—covering a bill of roughly $100 million.
In 2014, Harvard pledged to pay one-third of the cost to build West Station. Recently, several Massachusetts politicians signed a letter requesting the University foot the entire bill. One state representative, Michael J. Moran, went so far as to make an example of the company New Balance, which financed the entire $20 million cost of the Boston Landing commuter rail station in Brighton.
The comparison is grossly inappropriate and wholly unfair. New Balance is a private corporation focused on maximizing its revenue. Harvard is a nonprofit university whose goal is to educate its students and society. New Balance had a compelling business interest in building Boston Landing, which was a part of the company’s dramatic transformation of Brighton. And it paid only a fifth of what Harvard is now being asked to pay.
Yes, as we have opined, the University has previously  had difficult town-gown relations. It could do more to help sustain and support the community whose home it shares, particularly by actively publicizing and sharing the results of its continuing construction projects with Allstonians. Harvard would do well to contribute to the West Station project; the benefits of a new transit stop cannot be understated, especially for Allstonians, who have historically lacked access to the same transit systems that commuter rail stations provide to other parts of the Boston area. Indeed, other schools have helped their communities in similar ways. Princeton, for example, developed an entirely new train station complex in an initiative to help improve public infrastructure and promote the arts. Following this example, Harvard should contribute to the development of West Station in some capacity.
However, the request for Harvard to defray the entire $100 million cost of constructing West Station is inappropriate, especially given the state of the University’s finances over the past couple of years. Yes, Harvard may have an endowment of nearly $38 billion. Yet not all of this wealth is readily at hand—and poor returns like those Harvard Management Company, the group in charge of Harvard's endowment, has seen  in recent years have prompted concern that University budgets could be "significantly constrained" for years to come. In 2017, Harvard's endowment returns were outpaced by all other  Ivy League schools, and HMC is undergoing a dramatic internal restructuring. Now is the time for the University to be as conservative as possible with its finances.
Additionally, the new tax bill passed in December under the Republican-led Congress imposes an excise tax of 1.4 percent on returns for certain large endowments, which Harvard must now pay. This tax further limits the University’s financial flexibility.
Given these factors, Harvard is being as generous as it can with its proposed contribution of approximately $33 million to build West Station. What these lawmakers fail to understand is that Harvard does not have infinite resources, and is a nonprofit, educational institution rather than a company. Especially given the current state of its investment portfolio, the University should not be asked to pay more.
Harvard, after all, is not New Balance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to believe in identity politics because it told me: You and your experience matter. Your identity gives you authority. Your beliefs can’t be invalidated because your identity can’t be invalidated. This logical leap was empowering to take.
In the case of race, non-white people decided that their non-whiteness enabled them to speak with authority on topics of race. White people could only participate when they admitted that they were less worthy of speaking.
This kind of identity politics failed me when I went home. At the dinner table, I was ready to proselytize why we Asians, as people of color, needed to fight institutionalized racism and support minority movements like Black Lives Matter. I was armed with my experiences and the rhetoric of how America was built on a history of racism and white superiority.
But it was like I ran into a brick wall. The problem wasn’t that my parents didn’t know these things. They simply didn’t care much about them. They emphasized their own lived experiences as Asians instead—immigrating to America in the 1980s and creating new lives in a time of arguably more open racism than that of today. They didn’t have any reason to oppose whiteness and support black-led movements. White people weren’t any more racist to them than black people. The trajectories that other immigrants led proved that America was a land of opportunity, even for minorities.
Under the rules of identity politics, arguing with my parents about race became essentially impossible. I could never make progress if I kept staking my correctness on being Asian and my experiences living with that identity. My parents, who had the same marginalized identity, could do the same thing. We’d be at a standstill. Admitting that our beliefs were wrong would mean essentially yielding our identity, and nobody was willing to give that up.
I realized that I had lowered the standard of conversation by opening with appeals to our race. I was not giving reasons why we should act; I was merely arguing that external factors obligated us to act. But arguments following the logic of “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” make for halfhearted allyship at best.
The best solution was to deemphasize identity altogether. Appealing to my parents on the basis of race was unnecessary to the discussions I wanted to have. I wanted to make them care about what I saw as unjust killings of innocent people and unjust verdicts freeing culpable cops. But police brutality, at its core, is not about race. Why is it wrong for a police officer to shoot a man reaching for his wallet in his own car and then go free, for example? As Columbia professor Mark Lilla argues in his book "The Once and Future Liberal," those acts are wrong because the victim is another citizen, another human. Humans do not deserve to be deprived of the benefit of the doubt and killed for ordinary acts. Similarly, humans deserve to be held accountable for their misdoings and wronging of others.
This kind of rhetoric would be a much more effective strategy for groups like Black Lives Matter, which need widespread support to effect change. It’s tragic that, though the statement “black lives matter” is so obviously valid, after several years, most Americans still don’t support the movement. But that’s because its most vocal members have made everything about race—citing their race as the reason why everyone must listen to them, instead of trying to convince people why they must be listened to. They make as many sweeping generalizations about race—who can speak, who can ask questions, who can understand, who must try to understand but will never understand anyway—as they accuse others of making. So, they shouldn’t be surprised when, instead of effecting change, they are now mired in cultural wars—the product of dissenters turning identity politics against them.
Identity politics makes people feel better about themselves at the expense of productive discourse. A person’s lived experience should never be invalidated. But no identity makes the beliefs that someone derives from their lived experience automatically more correct. This is not just a logical fallacy that should be avoided on principle. In practice, it is actually a hindrance to persuading others. In a time of such polarization, identity politics makes us close ranks with the like-minded when we need to reach out.

Muralist Paul Deo will collaborate with local high schoolers and Harvard students to create an augmented reality mural at the Harvard Ed Portal in Allston.
The exhibit will be installed on one of the external walls of the Ed Portal during Arts First week in April. The Portal, which is located at 224 Western Ave., is a service initiative from the University that offers education, arts, wellness, and professional development workshops to Boston residents.
Paul Deo, a mixed-media artist who specializes in set designs and city murals, has previously worked on Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X” and Planet Harlem, a mural in Central Harlem. Deo’s work at Harvard is co-sponsored by the Office for the Arts and the Ed Portal.
Deo said the goal of the mural is to “uplift and celebrate” Allston residents.
“The mural is going to have aspects of what the students and what the residents—I’ll open it up to the community of Allston residents—what they will like to see and envision for Allston,” he said. “I think it represents that people care—that they care enough to have this groundbreaking, beautiful mural right there in Allston.”
Deo said he hopes to incorporate augmented reality—technologies which fuse animations and sound—into his two-dimensional mural.
Deo consulted Harvard and Allston students to develop a plan for the exhibit. According to Deo, Allston high school students told him they wanted the mural to have “bright colors” during an October 2017 meeting.
“Something that tells how great Allston is, how great of a place it is to live. They really wanted something positive and uplifting that they could take pride in and visit with their family members and friends and go through that experience together,” Deo said.
In a workshop last Friday, Harvard students decided to make the theme revolve around a sustainable, futuristic Allston. The students proposed asking Allston residents to recite a poem by Washington Allston, the namesake of the neighborhood, as part of the mural. Students also suggested including images of a flying MBTA subway line, the Charles River, and butterflies.
Though Allston high school students were supposed to participate in the workshop, only one attended.
“He [the high school student] said they had a whole lot of things going on, so I think they still want to remain involved through input and through the emails and connections. They seem really excited about it,” Deo said. “The interaction between the Harvard students and the Allston high schoolers is crucial.”
Moving forward, Deo said he plans to finalize the two-dimensional design and the augmented reality animations.
“I really want to uplift with my skills—to uplift and make people feel better about where they are and who they are,” Deo said. “I’m trying to break through that second dimension to heal the viewer and calm them. AR [Augmented reality] offers them that opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of Donald Trump administration controversy that culminated in a three-day government shutdown this week, several undergraduates said the recent political climate has forced them to reconsider their desire to pursue careers in government.
Diego A. Garcia ’20, the Institute of Politics’ communications director, said the past year “would give pause to anyone who’s considering a career in government.”
As a result, Garcia said he has pondered dedicating himself to private sector political opportunities like lobbying and political consulting.
“But at the end of the day, the dedication and passion for public service remains at the core of my interests,” Garcia said.
Madison A. Trice ’21, who said she aspires to work in foreign service and, eventually, the State Department, said the current state of politics has caused her to rethink the effect an administration can have on foreign service work.
“It makes it more difficult to envision representing the country’s interests as a foreign service officer,” Trice said. “A lot of the policies that are being touted right now [are] directly at odds with my personal values.”
Malcolm J. Reid ’21, a ground reach liaison at the IOP who said he aims to work with the Republican National Committee after graduation, said he found the shutdown especially concerning.
“I’ve never really seen people so divided,” Reid said.
Following the last government shutdown in Oct. 2013, eight percent of the class of 2014 moved on to careers in government, military service, non-profit agencies, or NGOs after graduation, based on a survey from the Office of Career Services. By comparison, just four percent of students in the class of 2013 went on to government or public-service related careers.
Robin Mount, a director at OCS, said midterm elections have brought a bump in interest in working in campaigns among undergraduates this year.
Renae Ford ’20, membership director of the Harvard College Democrats, said the Trump presidency spurred her to join the club. Through her activities with the organization, she said she has come to seriously consider campaign strategy—and, eventually, working in the White House—as a career path.
“I’ve never left a day of outreach not feeling good,” Ford said.
“I do think that maybe the election was such a shock to people that it made them more motivated to get involved,” Alexandra Shpitalnik ’19, campus outreach director for the Democrats, said. “Our first meeting of 2017 was bigger than I had ever seen one of our meetings be.”
Shpitalnik said she plans to work in non-governmental organizations after graduation and eventually transition into government work, though she said the current administration made her think more seriously about which type of work would suit her best.
“I decided that I want to work in NGOs for a long time before I start working for the government, because I want to get that background knowledge and then jump into the U.S. government work so that I can bring a lot of context into my field,” Shpitalnik said.
“Trump’s not going to be president forever,” she added.
Students also said they were looking to other career paths where they could help enact political change.
“We are seeing what they’re calling the ‘Trump bump’ in applications to law school,” Mount said. “There’s a lot of people interested in public interest law, in immigration law, and advocacy.”
Lisette Leon ’21 said she believes hateful and ignorant attitudes toward immigration have increased under the current administration, but that this increase has reaffirmed her career goals.
“Because Trump can say these things and he has a huge platform, other people feel empowered to say hateful things or ignorant things [about immigration]. And, if anything, it motivates me more to study government and pursue an immigration law career,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members and alumni of sororities across the nation took to social media Tuesday to offer support for Harvard sororities’ planned defiance of the College’s penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations.
The sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships. Harvard’s chapters of Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta announced in December they planned to defy Harvard’s penalties and instead continue with their standard female-only recruitment practices for members of the Class of 2021.
In a Facebook post Monday, the national Delta Gamma fraternity page asked its members to support sororities at Harvard by “wearing your anchor badge or letters” and “flooding the hashtag #HearHerHarvard with memories of the most influential moments of your DG story.” The National Panhellenic Conference, the umbrella organization for United States sororities, shared Delta Gamma’s post. The national Alpha Phi and Kappa Alpha Theta pages made similar posts.
“While Harvard’s sanctions claim to support women’s right to make their own decisions, these sanctions actually force women to choose between the opportunity to have supportive, empowering women-only spaces and external leadership opportunities,” Delta Gamma wrote in another post Tuesday.
Students and sorority and fraternity affiliates first popularized the hashtag #HearHerHarvard after University President Drew G. Faust debuted the sanctions in May 2016. The phrase recalls “Hear her, Harvard,” a slogan protesters chanted during a rally held in Harvard Yard a few days after Faust’s announcement.
“#WithoutMySorority we wouldn’t have our future bridesmaids or friends that will last a lifetime. #HearHerHarvard,” the chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta at California State University, Fresno wrote on its Facebook page.
Other sororities without chapters at Harvard also expressed their support.
“Today, we stand with the women of Harvard that are being stripped of leadership opportunities, scholarships, and fellowships for being a part of a Greek organization. #HearHerHarvard,” the Wright State University chapter of the Zeta Tau Alpha sorority wrote on its Facebook page.
Several members and alumni of various sororities also made individual Facebook and Twitter posts with the hashtag #HearHerHarvard. Many also posted supportive messages or pictures of themselves wearing their sorority letters.
Representatives from the National Panhellenic Conference did not respond to requests for comment.
Of the four sororities that recruited at the College last year, only one has opted out of recruitment this year. Earlier this month, the former Harvard chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma adopted gender-neutral membership practices and rebranded itself the Fleur-de-Lis.
In an interview in December, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the College would finalize an enforcement plan for the social group penalties by the start of this semester.

Amazon named Boston as one of 20 finalists in its search for a second headquarters earlier this month, after both city and Harvard leaders said they support the bid.
Boston has long been considered a top contender among the nearly 240 proposals for “HQ2,” the name for the Seattle-based company’s second home, which could one day support 50,000 employees.
Amazon will now move into the final phase of its nationwide search, undergoing studies of potential sites and labor markets as well as negotiating tax breaks from potential cities. Boston will face off against other major urban areas such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.
Several city officials stated their support for the bid, citing Boston’s skilled workforce and educational focus as key strengths.
"I am proud that Boston is on Amazon’s shortlist for its second North American headquarters. As a thriving city with a talented and diverse workforce, culture of innovation and opportunity for all, I see no better city than Boston for Amazon to call their second home,” Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh wrote in an emailed statement.
John Barros, Boston’s chief of economic development, also said he hopes Amazon will select the city for HQ2.
“Boston is a perfect location for Amazon to grow,” Barros wrote in an emailed statement. “We have excellent constitutions, talented and diverse residents, a strong ecosystem, and a great business climate.”
University President Drew G. Faust also said she was in favor of an Amazon headquarters in Boston in a letter to Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos in October, writing that “Amazon, and its commitment to service, innovation, and discovery, would be a welcome addition to our remarkable community here in Greater Boston.”
She also wrote that educational institutions in the greater Boston area would provide talented employees for the company.
“A well-educated workforce and the promising pipeline of exceptional, highly-skilled, and nimble labor are also particular hallmarks of our region,” Faust wrote.
Boston’s headquarters proposal presents the 75 colleges and universities across the city as a strategic advantage for Amazon, offering “highly skilled students and researchers from around the world” and providing “a source for strong partnerships and collaboration with the community.”
The proximity of a possible headquarters in Boston or Somerville, the two sites under consideration, could boost employment prospects for Harvard undergraduate and graduate students.
“Any company of that size bringing a headquarters to this location is going to be amazing for us from an economic development standpoint because they offer a range of different opportunities career-wise throughout the entire organization,” said Monica G. Tibbitts-Nutt, a freshman proctor who sits on the board of the MBTA. “The opportunities especially for undergraduates are going to be pretty amazing, from an internship standpoint all the way to that first job.”
However, some faculty remain concerned that the consequences of such a move might not be purely beneficial for the Boston area.
James G. Stockard Jr., a lecturer at the Graduate School of Design, said the boost to the economy and employment opportunities may have unforeseen consequences. Stockard said that young start-ups may be discouraged from establishing themselves in Boston because of Amazon driving up housing prices.
“The idea that a company like Amazon might keep more of those bright young minds in our area is a good thing, but unless there's a change in the housing market, those people will continue to bid up housing prices and prices will get higher and higher,” he said. “It's a double-edged sword for Amazon to be here in the long term, unless we can cope with the housing issues.”

Digital learning platform edX is partnering with Microsoft and General Electric to provide Massachusetts residents with subsidized online courses and guaranteed job interviews.
In a November press release announcing the new partnership, edX CEO and MIT professor Anant Agarwal said the program would expand career prospects for residents of the Commonwealth, giving them “the tools they need to gain knowledge in the most cutting edge fields, including Data Science, Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence.”
Founded in 2012 by Harvard and MIT, edX is an online education platform. The company offers over 16,000 massive open online courses and has enrolled approximately 15 million students, according to edX Vice President of Business Development Lee Rubenstein.
Microsoft will subsidize course fees for Massachusetts community college students taking edX’s introductory Computer Science Professional Certificate course. For six months, starting on May 1, Microsoft will cover tuition for the final segment of the three-part course for students who successfully complete the first two parts.
In addition, the company is offering 500 coupons for Massachusetts residents to enroll in any Microsoft-developed edX certificate course free of charge.
“By providing students and Massachusetts citizens with the necessary skills to bridge gaps in the tech industry, it helps them open new opportunities and be successful in their careers,” Chris Roy, a senior director at Microsoft, said in a press release.
GE, which began relocating its headquarters from Connecticut to Boston in 2016, is also offering 100 free edX certificates to Massachusetts residents. The company has promised that any Massachusetts resident completing and passing edX MicroMasters programs in Supply Chain Management, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, or Artificial Intelligence in 2018 will be offered an interview for either an internship or full-time position.
Announcing the partnership late last year, Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 simultaneously unveiled a Commission on Digital Innovation and Lifelong Learning, tasked with identifying ways to partner with industry and higher education to increase access to online education.
“We appreciate our local employers and higher education institutions creating more online programming to help address the diverse and changing needs of employers and students, including non-traditional learners and young people,” Baker said.
While Rubenstein said the new partnership’s reach cannot be measured until late summer, he said that edX’s collaboration with Microsoft and GE could expand in the future, and that other companies might sign on to similar partnerships.
“All signs are pointing to lots of interest from lots of corporations in students who have completed the MicroMasters courses. They are anxious to find people with these credentials,” Rubenstein said.
In the meantime, Rubenstein said he was optimistic that the program would help advance edX’s mission: to expand access to educational opportunities.
“For many people, they may find a path forward by taking these courses,” Rubenstein said.  “This partnership, it’s a table leveler.”

Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign is still below its $600 million financial aid goal as the fundraising drive enters its final months, according to donors who attended a fundraising event earlier this month in New York City.
The campaign passed its overall $6 billion goal in 2016, shattering higher education fundraising records in the process. As of June, the total sum had reached $8 billion. Despite this overall progress, though, some priorities are still short of their goals—and financial aid is one of them, administrators told College scholarship donors and recipients assembled at the Lincoln Center event on Jan. 10.
Even after a $125 million gift from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89—the largest donation the College had ever received—endowed hundreds of scholarships early in the campaign, the College has yet to meet its $600 million goal with less than six months left to go.
The capital campaign will officially conclude on June 30, according to outgoing Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74. University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment on the total sum the campaign has raised for financial aid thus far.
Roy G. Geronemus ’75, who has funded scholarships at the College for the past 15 years and also attended the event, said he was surprised the financial aid drive is lagging behind.
“I would have assumed that they would have been further along in obtaining the support that they need to give Harvard students whatever is necessary,” he said.
Despite the unexpected fundraising update, Geronemus said the event was a good motivator to continue contributing to the campaign.
“I think the team made a very compelling, supporting story to continue my interest and support of the value of supporting other students who require financial aid as a means of diversifying the class and providing opportunities to kids who wouldn’t have the opportunity to be there otherwise,” he said.
Griffin spoke at the Lincoln Center event about how he learned the importance of financial aid from his grandmother, who financed his education at the College. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75 described how financial aid made it possible for him to attend Harvard. And William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the University’s dean of admissions and financial aid, talked about the ways in which Harvard’s financial aid campaign can serve as an example for other institutions of higher learning, according to Kia C. Turner ’16.
Turner, who was a senior class gift marshall for the Class of 2016, said she spoke about how financial aid had impacted her experience at the College and post-graduation.
“We were there to tell our Harvard stories: tell why financial aid was so important to us, and then I think for me especially, it was not only ‘Why is financial aid important at the College?’, but ‘Why is it important once you leave the gates, when you go off into the world?’” Turner said.
Approximately 70 percent of Harvard students receive some form of financial aid, while 20 percent of students have full scholarships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 24, 2018 at 5:00 p.m.
When Paul Rudd comes to Cambridge next week to accept the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2018 Man of the Year award, students who want to do more than watch him from afar will have to fork over roughly $200.
Ticket holders will attend a celebrity roast of Rudd in the Pudding’s digs at Farkas Hall and will then be treated to the opening performance of the Pudding’s spring show, “HPT 170: Intermission Impossible!” The roast of Rudd requires “black-tie” attire, according to the Pudding’s website.
But just a week earlier on Jan. 25, when Mila Kunis visits campus to accept her 2018 Woman of the Year award from the Pudding, prospective attendees will pay $80: less than half the price of a ticket to see Rudd. Ticket holders will get to watch Kunis parade through the streets of Cambridge before attending a celebrity roast of the actress and a shorter, incomplete preview of the Pudding’s spring show.
Kunis’s roast is not black-tie, per the group’s website.
Students and wage policy experts say the way the two events are set up—and the price gap—is unfortunate. Some argue the Pudding should rethink the way it structures the Woman of the Year and Man of the Year celebrations.
The Pudding has been hosting Woman of the Year and Man of the Year celebrations since at least the late 1960s. The daylong festivities for each event include a celebrity roast, but only the Woman of the Year event includes a parade across campus.
“It clearly indicates that they take the Man of the Year event more seriously, assumed to be more high-profile, to attract people with higher income brackets, possibly who are already further in their career, or who think they can gain more from networking at the event,” said Ariane Hegewisch, program director for employment and earnings at the Institute for Women’s Policy Research.
“I think it sends a totally wrong message if the Man of the Year is associated more with the glamour, the black-tie, and the opening night,” Olivia A. Sison ’21 said. “The woman is somewhat brushed to the side if it’s a lower ticket price and less events happening.”
Pudding President Amira T. Weeks ’18 declined to comment.
Other students agreed with Hegewisch and Sison. Brandon N. Wachs ’18 and Matthew “Teddy” T. Brokaw ’18 suggested combining the Man of the Year and Woman of the Year festivities to help improve the situation.
“I can understand why an all-male acting troupe would want to have the male entertainer come to the opening night of their show,” Brokaw said. “It’s not totally out of the blue, but I don’t see why the events have to be seperate.”
“You could make the Woman of the Year event at the same time as the black-tie event. Actors and actresses both deserve equal recognition,” Wachs said.
Nonetheless, Economics Professor Claudia D. Goldin, who researches the gender wage gap, said she thinks the difference in ticket price has more to do with history than with gender inequality.
“This has zero to do with gender gap and pay. This has to do with the history of this institution, when they came up with this Man of the Year award—and [when] it became black-tie—and why, because Woman of the Year was much older,” Goldin said.
The Pudding’s Woman of the Year award started in 1951, preceding the first Man of the Year celebration by roughly a dozen years.
The Pudding has come under fire from alumni in recent years for its all-male membership practices. Women on campus have sought to audition for the historically male group three times and, each time, have failed to receive callbacks. More than 86 individuals signed a Pudding alumni petition in Sept. 2016 calling on the organization to admit women.
An op-ed in the Boston Globe last week criticized Kunis for accepting the Pudding’s invitation given the group’s refusal to go co-ed.
Kunis and Rudd did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
This article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 24, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Man of the Year celebration includes a parade through Cambridge. In fact, only the Pudding Woman of the Year celebration includes a parade through the area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

As the Department of Justice probe into Harvard’s admissions practices stretches into at least its fifth month, experts disagree over the driving force behind the investigation.
Some speculate the probe is politically motivated; others insist the investigation is more run-of-the-mill, meant to unearth information about the College’s often-opaque admissions practices. The ongoing Justice Department investigation, likely begun sometime over the summer, focuses particularly on allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants in Harvard’s admissions process.
William R. Yeomans, a former acting assistant attorney general under the Obama administration, said last week he believes the probe is likely “ideologically driven.”
Yeomans, who served the Justice Department in various roles for 26 years, said he thinks the political underpinnings of the probe into Harvard’s admissions are “pretty clear.” He pointed to the Obama administration’s decision not to take up similar complaints filed several years ago by a group of Asian-American student advocacy associations.
“I think it’s very interesting and somewhat telling that the Civil Rights Division under President Trump has taken this up,” Yeomans said.
Yeomans also said he thinks the department’s handling of this case is telling, calling it “procedurally irregular.”
“They have recruited people directly for the front office, which is the political portion of the Civil Rights Division,” Yeomans said.
Recently released internal emails show that a top official in the department likely requested attorneys to investigate admissions at Harvard. Yeomans said he thinks the investigation may be an effort to start a fresh round of litigation over affirmative action.
In an emailed statement, Department of Justice spokesperson Devin O'Malley wrote that the department “is committed to protecting all Americans from all forms of illegal race-based discrimination.” O'Malley added that Harvard has been facing allegations of discrimination against Asian Americans in its admissions process since at least May 2015.
"The prior administration did nothing to investigate that complaint," O'Malley wrote.
Other analysts disagreed with Yeomans. Roger Clegg, a former deputy assistant attorney general who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, called the idea the department is conducting the investigation for political reasons “laughable” in an interview Monday.
Clegg, who worked in the department from 1982 to 1993, said he thinks the shifts in the Justice Department’s activities between the current and the previous administration reflect only “differences of opinions.” He said the fact these differences exist does not make them “small-p political.”
“In my view, the Department was never more politicized under any administration than under the Obama administration,” Clegg said.
He added the department’s motivations most likely lie in the fact that Harvard is a high-profile university, making concerns over discrimination at the school a high-profile case.
“Harvard University has been sued for discriminating against Asian-Americans,” Clegg said. “It would be shocking if the Justice Department were not interested in this.”
Still other experts offered varying assessments of the situation.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a Stetson University College of Law professor, said he sees “many objective reasons” apart from political motivation that would explain the investigation.
He speculated the investigation may be motivated in part by practical considerations. For example, the Justice Department might want to obtain documents explaining Harvard’s admissions policies, he said. The College has historically released little data about its admissions process.
Matthew Cregor, a staff attorney at the Boston-based Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, said he is concerned the department’s investigation may be inappropriate in light of the ongoing lawsuit introduced by Students for Fair Admissions, an Asian-American advocacy group. The Lawyers' Committee recently filed an amicus brief in support of affirmative action at Harvard.
“What’s disconcerting is the degree of federal effort that’s being expended to disrupt an ongoing, important case inside the federal district court,” Cregor said.
The lawsuit is currently in the late stages of its discovery phase. Expert discovery and depositions are scheduled to complete on May 1, 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Design will soon welcome renowned architects Jeanne Gang, Mark Lee, and Sharon Johnston into its halls as new professors of practice.
Gang, who won a MacArthur Fellowship in 2011, heads the Chicago and New York-based architecture and urban design firm Studio Gang. One of her recent projects was the Aqua Tower, an 82-story Chicago skyscraper with an exterior modeled after the shape of water. The building earned the Emporis Skyscraper Award in 2009. Gang’s work focuses on the importance of materials, the environment, and innovative ways of managing waste, according to Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi.
Johnston and Lee are founding partners of the Los Angeles-based architecture firm Johnston Marklee, and co-directors of the Chicago Architecture Biennial, the largest architecture and design exhibition in North America.
Johnston said she and Lee “focus on the arts and education” in their work. The Menil Drawing Institute, a 30,000 square foot modern art museum in Houston designed by the pair, will open this year.
In an interview, Mostafavi described Gang, Lee, and Johnston as “at the forefront of the next generation of contemporary architects.”
“They’re not just practitioners who come and work with our students as professionals, but really creative innovative thinkers,” Mostafavi said.
The three architects—who are all alumni of the Graduate School of Design—will be teaching studio classes closely connected to their professional work starting this semester.
Lee said he sees teaching as an important complement to his private sector endeavors.
“Teaching is something that works seamlessly with practice. Teaching is not just the transference of knowledge, but very much about the production of knowledge,” Lee said.
Johnston and Lee’s studio class, called “Museum Island,” will examine “‘island’ and archipelago’ organizations in architecture and their generative potential in urban design,” according to the course description. The course will ask students to design an art storage building on the Menil Foundation campus in Houston, where Johnston and Lee’s museum project will open later this year. One of the course’s goals, according to Lee, will be “studying how institutions could be integrated with a neighborhood.”
Gang’s course, “After the Storm: Restructuring an Island Ecosystem,” will focus on the humanitarian response and aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria on the Caribbean, particularly the U.S. Virgin Islands. The class will be co-taught by Claire Cahan, an architect at Studio Gang.
Johnston said she looks forward to contributing to the graduate school she attended now as a faculty member.
“It has been a really rewarding reconnection with the GSD,” Johnston said.
Lee added the School has evolved since his time at Harvard.
“The campus has changed a lot, Harvard Square has changed a lot, the School has grown a lot,” Lee said. “The School is at a new threshold of a new future with global connection, we’re very excited to be part of this.”

If you play your cards right, shopping week can simply be an extension of winter break: catching up with friends all day, and then partying every night. Plan poorly, and you’re in for a week of hell. Don’t play yourself, avoid these shopping week mistakes:
Shopping a 9 a.m. class…and liking it
The best way to make sure you’re not in any early-morning classes is to not even consider them in the first place. Trust us, it’s not worth it—no matter how interesting the subject, or how cute the TF.
Getting there early
There’s nothing worse than getting a seat near the front of the class and then watching the room fill up, as you realize with horror that you’ve got no clear escape route. Were you thinking of shopping another class after the first half hour? Too bad; you’ll either have to stay put, walk in front of the projector, or trample your potential future classmates on the way out.
Missing a class that only meets once a week
If you’re considering shopping some niche seminar that only meets once a week, make sure you don’t sleep through it. You’ll either spend the whole semester in a class you don’t like, or wonder for the rest of your life if you missed out on a transformative experience.
Shopping classes that are actually challenging and intellectually fulfilling
You mean you actually came to Harvard to learn from illustrious professors and engage in stimulating conversation? Oh please, stop being such a hardo and just take an easy Gen Ed. You might even meet a hookup on the football team along the way.

This year, my family and I spent Christmas in Cuenca and New Year’s in Quito, Ecuador. Both cities are full of cathedrals and Spanish-style colonial architecture, but the Andean culture is still very much a part of daily life. Christmas is celebrated with extravagant parades and a midnight dinner, while on New Year’s Ecuadoreans light fireworks and burn paper mache dolls of locals, politicians, or figures from pop culture to symbolize leaving the old year behind.
Incan representations of the sun are situated alongside traditional Catholic iconography on the ceiling of Quito’s San Sebastian Church. This blending of symbols, called syncretism, can be observed in churches all around Latin America.
A man stands in the plaza outside Quito’s Basílica del Voto Nacional, the largest Neo-Gothic church in North and South America.
A detailed nativity scene, complete with a dinosaur, is displayed in one of Cuenca’s markets.
Lights over Rio Tomebamba in Cuenca signal the holiday season.
A uniformed man plays trombone in a pre-Christmas parade passing through Parque Calderon in Cuenca.
Dancers perform in the Parade of the Traveling Child, held in Cuenca every year on December 24. Parades like this are held throughout Ecuador and some other parts of Latin America, but Cuenca claims to be the largest, with 50,000 participants and 200,000 spectators.
A small girl rides a lavishly decorated horse in Cuenca’s Pase del Niño parade. Adults as well as children go all out for the parade, dressing as angels, Santa Claus, or figures from the Bible. Participants wear clothing from different regions of Ecuador and the world.
A float in Cuenca’s Pase del Niño parade features a doll atop a roast pig. The name of the parade refers to a statue of the baby Jesus that was blessed by the Pope in 1961 and then returned to Ecuador.

The three blue domes of the New Cathedral dominate Cuenca’s skyline. The city is well-known for its colonial architecture, and the center of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Decorated cars make their way to the much smaller Christmas Day parade in Cuenca.

Fireworks explode over the winged Virgin of Quito on New Year’s Eve. The statue is based on a description of the Woman of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelations, and locals claim that Quito’s statue is the only one in the world with wings.
A man passes on the opposite side of the street during the changing of the guards at Quito’s Presidential Palace on New Year’s Day. This half-hour event occurs every Monday and attracts a large crowd of locals and tourists even on rainy days—the guards sing, play instruments, ride horses and are sometimes greeted by the President himself.

It’s summer in the southern hemisphere, which means long days and warm weather. Buenos Aires is a crowded and busy city, in contrast to the smaller town of Bariloche nestled among the mountains.
La Recoleta Cemetery is an expansive above-ground cemetery where graves are placed inside small houses dedicated to one family each.

As 2017 came to a close, people around the world celebrated. Thousands of people chose to ring in the new year aboard cruise ships. On these floating hotels, nightly sunsets over the ocean, delicious food, and ever changing exotic destinations become the norm.  The Caribbean is the most popular cruise destination in the world, with stunning beaches, tropical weather, and accessibility from the US Mainland. I started 2018 off with a weeklong cruise on board Holland America’s Eurodam, stopping at ports throughout the Caribbean

On board, celebrations raged around the pool as everyone counted down to midnight, complete with streamers, blowers, hats, champagne, a TV showing the Ball Drop in New York, and a melting ice sculpture, pictured here.
Large cruise ships host thousands of guests and employees on each voyage. At each port, most people disembark, spend the day in port, and then return to the dock to reboard
Our first port was Key West, Florida. A small island in the Florida Keys, Key West has a laid back atmosphere with plenty of shops and restaurants which cater to tourists.
The next day, it was the port of Grand Turk, an island in Turks and Caicos. A beautiful white sand beach was located just off the dock , allowing visitors to swim literally feet from the cruise ship.
Here you can see the beach and shopping area from the dock. This port, like many in the Caribbean, was built by cruise ship companies and includes stores, restaurants, and a pool, allowing guests to essentially get off the boat and visit different resorts.
In the Dominican Republic, we left the port and explored the town of Puerto Plata on the northern coast of the island. Here, a street performer greets the buses of cruise ship passengers arriving in the town center. 
We visited the Fortaleza San Felipe, a Spanish fortress from the 16th century which is now home to a museum. The Dominican Republic is located on the island of Hispaniola, which Christopher Columbus claimed for Spain in 1492. It did not gain independence from Spain until 1821. 
Here local people pick through a trash dump on the side of the road. Driving back to the ship, we learned about the high rates of poverty in the Dominican Republic, a reminder that life for local people is very different from the manicured facade of the cruise terminals and resorts.
As we left, storms began to roll in and it was not hard to understand why the original Jurassic Park movie was filmed in this area. The region is known as the Amber Coast because of the amber which is found there.
