After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard graduates and former Overseers, we write to state our concerns with steps taken over the past two years by Harvard administrators and the Harvard Corporation to limit the First Amendment rights of free association of the Harvard undergraduate student body.
Our concern is on two levels: the governance of Harvard College, and the threats of academic and other punishments for students who exercise their legal rights in a manner not approved by the Corporation and administrators.
Regarding governance, the Statutes of Harvard University, which are essentially the Corporation's bylaws, clearly state that the responsibility for College student discipline belongs to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Appropriate rules are included in the Handbook for Students, which is approved annually by the Faculty.
When the Corporation and administration issued their final statement on Dec. 5, 2017 regarding students who join “unrecognized” single-gender clubs, they did not have the approval of the Faculty. Nor did they indicate that they planned to seek Faculty approval to put the policy in the Handbook for Students. The punishment for joining a single-gender club is ineligibility for academic endorsements such as the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships and the Fulbright Program, as well as ineligibility for leadership positions in “recognized” student organizations, including varsity captaincies. We cannot imagine a system of policing or informants that would effectively identify club members that would also be consistent with the basic values of the University.
It is clear that the Corporation has usurped the power of the Faculty. We regret the precedent this sets. Next it could be the Faculty who are told what to teach and with whom to associate. Anyone familiar with McCarthyism knows how quickly government and corporate overreach can happen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve often been in the middle.
My family is middle-class—as middle-class as you can get in America. My mother, the daughter of immigrants, went to college and got a bachelor’s degree, the first in her family to do so. My father, a Mexican immigrant, didn’t.
I’ve always been aware of labels—especially “first-generation,” with all its meanings. Does my background make me a first-generation American? Through my father, I have many of the experiences and stories that come with having a parent who directly faced the struggles of immigrating to and navigating this country.
But practically, I’m not first-generation. I've received many of the benefits of having a parent who was born here, speaks English, and was college-educated. It has made a difference in my upbringing, especially in my majority-minority, lower-middle-class Los Angeles suburb, where I often felt advantaged as compared to my peers. Many of my friends’ parents spoke only Spanish, Chinese, or Vietnamese. They were often the first to go to college in their families, relying on friends, the occasional older sibling, or teacher guidance in navigating the college admissions process.
But despite my mother’s experiences, my understanding of the college admissions process was not perfect. I ended up relying on many resources, especially as I made my way through high school. Friends and especially teachers often were the ones to recommend higher-level courses to me, suggest which tests to take, and which colleges to look at. In retrospect, I wasn’t all that advantaged in the college application process, because my mother and peers could not tell me everything I wanted and needed to know. For example, I did not visit many of the schools I applied to beforehand, Harvard included. I was often left alone to seek a path no one I knew had trod.
And then I came to Harvard, and I experienced what I thought it must be like to be less advantaged for the first time in my life. I had lived in a bubble—one where no one went to private school, people did not regularly vacation in Europe, and squash and sailing were not typical sports. My high school did not offer courses in computer science, much less Latin, ethics, or any of the courses commonplace in my peers’ transcripts. Even now, I still gape at some of my classmates’ backgrounds, their casual stories about skiing vacations, trips to the Cape, or far-flung gap years.
Even with a mother who was college-educated, who could tell me about experiences and mistakes she made growing up, I could not prepare for what Harvard presented. Like the child of immigrants who struggles to understand his place in society, I’ve often wondered where I stand in relation to others.
I wrote once about how different life and expectations are in my hometown, compared to at Harvard. Yet when I returned home last May, my mother chuckled after I used a certain word in conversation. I don’t remember the word, but it was sufficiently polysyllabic (though I thought it unassuming enough) for her to remark: “Every time you come back, you talk differently, and slowly, it goes away.”
And like that, the ice-cold feeling of falseness I thought I had shed crept back, consuming me. I was an imposter in my own home, in front of someone I had always known. It was something that had been growing for a while, but I hadn’t wanted to face it: I felt a different person in Massachusetts than in California.
A daunting question now crossed my mind: How could I reconcile the two worlds I walked? Would I choose one over the other? Would I halve myself, or merge?
***
Late one seasonably warm January night, I walked down the main street of Alhambra, California. A street band played songs in a diner’s open patio, which caught my attention. I tried to remember where I had first heard the song playing, when it hit me—it was from “The Fantasticks,” a musical I had discovered at Harvard.
I cast my mind around, and my thoughts landed in Cambridge, and Pforzheimer House, and the Charles River, and the Barker Center, and all the images that fill me when I think of my snowy home away from home. That late-night diner was so far away from it, and yet so close—a simple song could make those three thousand miles taper into a single vanishing point. In that moment, Cambridge and Los Angeles were one, and my memories were one—and I was one.
I got home, and stayed up late thinking about my two worlds. I understood now—I can, and have a right to, feel equally at home at both. I love both Harvard and home fiercely, for all they’ve given me. I do not have to give up one to accept the other. I can use what I learn in one to appreciate the other, for nothing exists in a vacuum. For those of us who struggle with belonging at Harvard, we need to be honest and comfortable with reconciling our many sides—we just  need to be comfortable in the middle. We can only do that by finding the vanishing point on the horizon between our two worlds—sometimes as simple, and elusive, as a song.

“Omfg my dad just asked if we were dating.”
The message, which followed a string of crying emojis, flickered onto the screen of my iPhone as I sat at a stoplight on my way home from my friend’s house. While there, we had sat on her couch under a blanket watching a Netflix documentary. We had shared in laughs, gossip, and commentary, but there was no reason to presume intimacy between us, except for that I am a man, and she is a woman.
This presumption is not new to me. As someone who predominantly surrounds myself with female friends, the extent of my friendships has always been scrutinized. The idea that a boy and a girl can simply be friends is perplexing to our society.
“I was like, uh, well, he's gay, dad,” my friend said she responded.
Since coming out as queer, my sexual orientation has exempted me from assumed relationships with my female friends. Though valid, the response suggests that the only reason we are not dating is because I identify as gay—as if in an alternate universe in which I were straight, the narrative would be different. Often, we do not realize that we are scripted into espousing heteronormativity even when we try to avoid it.
In schools, rhymes circulate about boys and girls from different planets. Though seemingly harmless, they construct boys and girls as polarized beings. Parental influences further exacerbate this primitive assumption by heavily gendering their children’s lives. Sleepovers are segregated by gender to stunt budding sexualities. Cross-gender schoolyard bullying is excused as a signal of male affection. Parents gossip about their children’s “crushes” and “significant others” even when their children are at an age too early to understand the complexities of romantic relationships.
Heteronormativity is cyclical and often operates subconsciously. Because we are raised among these assumptions, we are liable to reproduce them. When the gendered demarcations we hold true become blurred, we automatically assume there must be a romantic or sexual interest between the two parties. Marriage is seen as the paragon of male-female relationships. All other forms of relationships are seen as subpar.
The hegemonic marriage narrative is vehemently perpetrated through all facets of society. In the media, opposite-gender leads often fall in love, regardless of the overall plot of the movie. We employ the term “friend zone” to categorize friends of the different genders who will never be of romantic interest. We say people are “just friends” as if being friends does not realize the full potential of a relationship. We assume a friends-with-benefits relationship will ultimately result in one partner, or both, “catching feelings” because we have a hard time fathoming sex without romantic undertones. By overemphasizing marriage, society ultimately devalues friendships.
The devaluation of friendships extends beyond straight people. By constantly, automatically assuming that male-female friendships are relationships, we assume that heterosexuality is the norm, and anything deviating is abnormal. While I knew I was gay from a young age, the internalized homophobia this type of thinking breeds stunted my coming-out process. It delayed my coming out by multiple years because thinking in terms of heterosexual structures was (and largely remains) ingrained in me as a byproduct of my socialization.
Though identifying as LGBTQ+ may seemingly exempt people from the assumptions we make about relationships, queer people are actually typed into a modified version of the relationship norms that police straight people. As with straight people, the media plays a large role in perpetuating this assumption. Movies with same-sex gay leads rarely resolve without the leads falling in love. Following the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015, many openly gay people of the same gender are now assumed to be in romantic relationships. As with straight people, we have a hard time looking at two queer people without scripting them onto a pathway to marriage.
The marriage model is also extremely exclusionary to those who identify as non-binary or gender non-conforming. Because contemporary understandings of marriage rely so heavily upon the heterosexual (and, more recently, same-sex) couplings, non-binary people can often be forgotten from the narrative and impact of this issue altogether, or they can be typed into cisgender roles that do not reflect their true gender identity.
Our strong emphasis on marriage results in a reduced social importance of friendships with those of the preferred gender. By treating marriage as life’s ultimate goal, society stunts the networks and the learning possible through interpersonal interactions. By treating boys and girls as separate entities at a young age, before questions of sexuality arise, we allow for gendered behavior to become cyclical and subconscious. For example, by excusing boys who tease and bully girls on the playground as “having a crush,” we allow boys to grow up thinking that they can disrespect female bodies and use affection as a scapegoat rather than being respectful of boundaries and responsible for their behavior. Typing behaviors and friendships as romantic is not only pervasive but dangerous.
We live in a world that tells us boys should befriend boys and girls should befriend girls. But by diminishing the value of friendships between boys and girls, we stunt the learning that can be done from befriending those with different experiences and identities. What’s more, not everyone wants to marry, so we should avoid trying to fit everyone into that narrative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

On Saturday—one year after the inauguration of President Donald Trump—Cambridge Common flooded with men and women clad in pink hats as part of a nation-wide weekend of Women’s Marches.
The 2018 Cambridge and Boston Women’s March marked the first anniversary of the Women’s March movement, born last year in protest of Trump’s election. By 1 p.m. Saturday, roughly 13,500 people had indicated on Facebook they planned to attend the march. The gathering took place in the 16-acre park across Mass. Ave. from Harvard Law School.
The co-sponsors of Saturday's march included activist groups like Boston Persists, Human Rights Festival, March Forward Massachusetts, and Massachusetts Peace Action.
Like in marches last year, participating activists, including politicians like Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, denounced the President’s treatment of and attitude toward women.
“Let me be clear: We have a president who demeans and insults women,” Healey said to the crowd Saturday. “He actively lowers our standing in the world. He is an embarrassment and certainly no role model for our young girls and boys.”
Issues of sexual assault drew increased national attention in 2017, bolstered by anti-sexual harassment movements including #MeToo and #TimesUp, among others. Jennifer N. Baker ’21, who marched on the Common on Saturday, said she felt encouraged by the increase in activism that took place in 2017.
“I once heard someone say, ‘Maybe this isn’t the darkness of the tomb, but the darkness of the womb,’ which I found really powerful,” she said. “Although 2017 was a pretty rough year for a lot of different groups of people, it definitely has sparked a lot of participation and passion.”
Zachary D. S. Schnall ’21, who also participated Saturday, said he felt similarly inspired by the various marches last year.
“[They] all demonstrated that people are willing to rise up and rise to the challenge, and I think that demonstrates the...potential for the future in terms of the next wave of elections in 2018,” Schnall said.
Healey said she agreed.
“If there’s one thing to take away from today, it’s that we’re still here, we’re still marching, and—you better believe it—we are winning,” she said.
Scattered among the sea of cat-eared pink hats—a symbol of the Women’s March that emerged last year in response to Trump’s comments about inappropriately touching women—were blue hats meant to inspire hope for a “blue wave” for Democrats in midterm elections later this year.
Speakers at the event highlighted a wide spectrum of issues, ranging from the treatment of incarcerated women to transgender rights to the plight of Puerto Rican families who came to Boston to escape damage caused by a recent hurricane.
Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19, another attendee, said she felt “uplifted” to see marchers advocating for a wide variety of causes Saturday. Some observers alleged last year’s march focused too much on white, cisgender women.
This year’s list of speakers included people of color and transgender women.
“They were really talking about racial justice, economic justice, peace, environmental justice, trans justice, as things that all come together and that we can agree upon,” Goldberg said.
“I think that coalition is never easy, and solidarity is never easy, but it’s always worth it,” she added.
Nonetheless, some participants said they wished the Women’s March movement reached further across the aisle to include people with other political ideologies.
Around 20 members of Boston-based political group Resist Marxism—a group that includes libertarians and Trump supporters—attended the March. Members of the group said they wanted to start conversations with other marchers to better bridge ideological divides.
Samson Racioppi, a libertarian candidate running for office in Massachusetts’ sixth congressional district, said Resist Marxism reached out to the march’s organizers to participate but received no reply. Organizers of the march did not immediately respond to requests for a comment about Resist Marxism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five Harvard baseball alumni who now occupy top spots in Major League Baseball front offices will return to Harvard for a question-and-answer panel Monday.
The event, co-sponsored by Friends of Harvard Baseball and the Harvard Varsity Club, will be held at the Harvard Club of Boston. According to the Harvard Varsity Club website, the session will be a chance to hear about “how Harvard baseball helped get [the former players] to where they are today” and “their insider information on their teams and the industry.”
The panel will include Michael Hill ’93, David Forst ’98, Peter Woodfork ’99, Jeff Bridich ’00, and Ben Crockett ’02.
Hill is the current president of baseball operations for the Miami Marlins, Forst is the general manager of the Oakland Athletic, and Bridich is the senior vice president and general manager of the Colorado Rockies. Crockett is employed closest to Harvard’s campus as the vice president of Player Development for the Boston Red Sox. Woodfork is employed directly by Major League Baseball as the senior vice president of baseball operations.
According to Dave “Doc” O’Connell ’90, chair of the Friends of Harvard Baseball, the event was created in an effort to raise funds for Harvard’s baseball team.
“We want to raise enough funds that we can be competitive, give coach [Bill] Decker what he needs, but certainly as a former player and someone who loves Harvard, I’m just happy to see more people… [participating] in the community,” O’Connell said.
The Friends of Harvard Baseball tapped Jon Paul Morosi ’04, a former Crimson sports editor, as moderator. Morosi currently reports for MLB.com and MLB Network.
“He’s also got Harvard connections, and he’s one of the guys that speaks and presents for a living,” O’Connell said. “We think he’ll do a great job sort of acting as master of ceremonies.”
Forst said becoming involved in the sports industry was a natural extension of his Harvard education and the time he spent as a member of Harvard baseball.
“I didn’t really know what else to do when I graduated, to be honest,” Forst said. “I wanted to keep playing, first and foremost, so I played a couple years of independent ball after graduation. I didn’t grow up wanting to be a GM or wanting to work in a baseball front office. I grew up wanting to play in the big leagues, and when that didn’t happen I figured this was the next best thing.”
Forst said his resume was unique when he broke into the industry. These days, though, professional sports front offices are flooded with former Ivy League athletes and those without any playing experience alike, Forst added.
“The game has progressed to the point where you don’t have to have played the game, really to any extent, to be successful,” Forst said. “So it’s opened up the field to a much more diverse group of candidates, which is great. But it’s made it incredibly competitive for anyone wanting to get into sports.”
Like Forst, other members of the panel said they leveraged their Harvard education and baseball experience into roles at the forefront of the sports business.
“Harvard’s a special place, but Harvard baseball is too, and we have a really unique distinction with so many former players working for Major League teams and in the Major League front office,” O’Connell said. “So it’s just pretty special to have that sort of insider level of knowledge, and we think the community will like it.”

When students pass through Harvard Yard on their morning commutes this week, they’ll see a new visitor sitting next to the John Harvard statue: a man in a suit, his legs crossed and his body composed of colorful plastic straws. In his hands, he holds a sign reading: “Create the Future You Want.”
This installation, titled “Straw Man,” is the brainchild of David A. Edwards, a professor of idea translation in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and his teaching fellow Alen Agaronov, a doctoral student in the School of Public Health.
Edwards said he found “Straw Man” moving because of his "ambiguity.”
Nonetheless, the installation has at least one clear purpose: to encourage viewers to reflect on how they pay attention to information, Edwards said.
“Particularly today, in the rush of information and decisions that we face each day and kind of the mindless flow of contemporary life, it is easy to become a straw man. And a challenge we have… is to pay attention to our moment and to actually exist in that moment,” he said.
“Straw Man” also doubles as an advertisement for Edwards’s course, “Engineering Sciences 20: How to Create Things & Have Them Matter.” Edwards and Agaronov first designed “Strawman” while they were planning for the semester in December.
“We began to imagine an installation on campus. Initially, I had an idea of an installation of plastic straws and then Alen had this idea of actually making ‘Straw Man,’” he said.
One of the themes of the course is the ocean and sustainability. Plastic straws represent an increasing percentage of the eight million tons of plastic that are dumped into oceans each year. The construction of “Straw Man,” Edwards said, relates to the course through the theme of ocean pollution.
“I’m intrigued by this notion of a straw man that kind of doesn’t go away. It’s made of plastic straws; as you know, they resist recycling in many instances, just a massive problem in the ocean. The creation of straw man, this plastic refuse, is really provocative for me,” he said.
Edwards said the theme of environmental sustainability is a lead-in to the larger issue of “things that last for a long time.” He added “Straw Man” has broader implications in the context of President Donald Trump’s environmental policy.
“I think that mindlessness in governance, mindlessness from the government of the United States to our own lives is something we all really need to battle against. And today, particularly, the consequences are just enormous,” he said.
“Straw Man” has already had a brush with authority. Edwards and Agaronov first set up the installation on Friday night only to discover hours later it had been removed by Yard Operations. Edwards said on Saturday they plan to set “Straw Man” up again on Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
John W. Etchemendy, former Stanford University provost and a contender in Harvard’s last presidential search, knew how to ensure Stanford's presidential search committee kept the names of candidates confidential.
Etchemendy would sit down with searchers and relate the “horror story” of how, in a previous search at an unspecified university, one candidate—a sitting president at a different school—ended up losing his job after the shortlist of finalists leaked to a student newspaper.
“That person, it turned out, did not get the job and was fired from his current position, because he showed a lack of loyalty to his current position,” Etchemendy said. “So that’s the kind of horror story in the back of your mind.”
Etchemendy—who served as the vice chair of Stanford’s 1998 presidential search committee and who said he has consulted Harvard search committees—said this story helps explain Harvard’s desire to keep candidate names private in its ongoing search for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust. The University has been seeking the next president since Faust announced over the summer she plans to step down in June 2018.
Harvard presidential searches are known for their secrecy; searchers have sometimes gone to extreme measures to keep candidate names confidential, even sneaking contenders up back-service stairways and through garages to evade reporters. This year’s iteration of the search has been no different. The committee seeking Harvard’s 29th president—comprising all twelve members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—has repeatedly declined to comment on the search.
In an interview last week, though, Etchemendy offered some clues to how Harvard’s search is likely progressing. Drawing on his own experience leading scores of administrative searches at Stanford, Etchemendy described a monthslong, intense process involving hundreds of hours of research, interviews, and exhausting travel meant to bring searchers together.
Etchemendy also drew on more personal experience of Harvard’s search process; in the University’s last presidential search, Etchemendy made the search committee’s shortlist, The Crimson reported in Jan. 2007.
Search committee members typically spend the first two months gathering information about candidates as well as the state of the university, Etchemendy said. This timeline matches with Harvard’s current search; senior fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72, who chairs the University’s search committee, has said the committee spent much of July and August doing this kind of “information-gathering.”
Etchemendy said this kind of research is necessary to find the right set of candidates—he said top contenders are almost never people who would apply for the job.
“So obviously you advertise the opening, but the applicants you get are generally not really qualified, which is kind of odd,” Etchemendy said. “So you have to actually do an active search and figure out who is out there, who we might be interested in.”
Following that research period, committee members begin travelling around to meet people—usually top administrators at universities across the country—to gather their input on the search, according to Etchemendy. He said this input-seeking phase generally lasts for another two to three months.
He added that, sometimes, higher education experts interviewed by search committees end up as candidates themselves.
“So it’s funny, you meet with a person, and ask about, ‘What is your opinion of Harvard? What should we be looking for in a president, who is out there that we should be looking at?’” Etchemendy said. “And it might well be that the person you are talking to is also someone that you are interested in.”
After wrapping up these meetings, committees work to pare to a shortlist, Etchemendy said. Committee members then bring in a select handful of finalists for day-long interviews, “maybe even day and a half” interviews.
Searchers typically prepare a list of questions for the candidate to answer, but only tell contenders some of the topics in advance. Candidate interviews take place in a variety of settings: at more formal meetings as well as over meals like lunch and dinner. Etchemendy said this is meant to test how candidates behave “socially,” as well as how they would interact with top donors in social settings.
The constant travel and the hours and hours of interviews are meant to bring searchers together, Etchemendy said. He said the search process “bonds the committee.”
“That is really important because you don’t want to get to the end of the search and have committee members either not trusting each other or really violently disagreeing about who are viable candidates,” he said. “And so there’s a kind of community building exercise that goes on.”
Another element that fosters a sense of camaraderie is the total confidentiality of the process, Etchemendy said. He noted that no candidate knows who any of the other candidates are until the very end of the search. Even searchers’ closest family members are kept in the dark.
“I tell search committee members, don’t even tell your spouse what’s going on in the search,” Etchemendy said.
Etchemendy said he is unsure who is likely on Harvard’s shortlist this time around, though he said he thinks it is an “absolute incredible privilege and honor” to hold the University’s top job. Nonetheless, he said he was never seriously interested in the position in 2007.
He said he made his lack of interest clear to the 2007 search committee “early on.” But he said he did not mind reading his name as a potential candidate in The Crimson.
“So you know, it doesn’t hurt—basically it doesn’t hurt anybody to be mentioned as a potential candidate for the presidency of Harvard,” he said.

UPDATED: January 24, 2018 at 2:57 p.m.
Massachusetts Senator and former Law School professor Elizabeth Warren endorsed Harvard’s graduate student union Friday, weeks ahead of an election that will determine whether eligible University teaching and research assistants may unionize.
“For generations, graduate students have done hard work that keeps universities running. It’s past time for them to be treated with respect and past time for them to have their own elected representation in the decisions that affect their lives,” Warren wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson Friday. “Grad students are organizing and I stand with them.”
Warren’s statement follows a Jan. 9 Facebook post by the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers that shared photos of Warren and her signature on a pro-unionization petition. Warren, along with Mass. Senator Edward J. Markey, U.S. Representative Katherine M. Clark, and U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano, previously wrote a letter in May 2016 asking Harvard to voluntarily cooperate with the unionization effort.
The Massachusetts senator's endorsement comes as Harvard prepares to hold a second unionization election. The National Labor Relations Board on Jan. 11 certified the results of the University's Nov. 2016 unionization election—which showed 1,526 votes against unionization and 1,396 in favor.  Per a previous ruling, this finalized result means Harvard must hold a new election due to inconsistencies in the Nov. 2016 voter rolls.
Harvard administrators were not immediately available for comment Sunday evening.
Law School student and union organizer Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15 said she thinks Warren’s message should encourage eligible students to vote in favor of unionization.
“Her support is a sign that voting for the union is the right thing to do for people who believe in Senator Warren’s vision of an economy and a politics that works for everyone,” Sandalow-Ash said.
Sandalow-Ash said she spoke with Warren after a chance encounter in a Cambridge restaurant and asked her to support the union’s organizing efforts earlier this month.
“[Warren] said it was really important for ordinary people, not just politicians, to be working for social and economic justice and to be involved in combating the Trump agenda,” Sandalow-Ash said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 24, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Senator Elizabeth Warren said her grandfather was a member of a union. In fact, Warren said her uncle was a member of a union.

Tamara E. Rogers ’74, the University’s vice president for alumni affairs and development and the force behind Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign, will step down at the end of the calendar year.
University President Drew G. Faust announced Rogers’ departure in an email to alumni Thursday. Rogers, who assumed the role in 2007, helped oversee the first University-wide capital campaign, which launched in Sept. 2013 and is set to conclude at the end of June. The campaign had raised over $8 billion as of June 2017.
In an email to alumni and University affiliates, Faust thanked Rogers for her work and called her a “model steward” of the school’s interests over her tenure.
“Almost from the day I was appointed dean of the Radcliffe Institute seventeen years ago, I have benefited from Tamara’s dedication, professionalism, friendship, and wisdom,” Faust wrote of Rogers.
 Rogers started her Harvard career in the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, eventually becoming the head of international admissions before transitioning to fundraising. She said one of her favorite things about working at Harvard was the connections between her different roles over time.
“[Harvard] really is a community when it comes to our alumni, and I work with people now who are volunteers where I maybe interviewed them for the college or read their application.” Rogers said. “Seeing that connectivity of people who you know come as very young people and then really never depart — they stay connected — is just immensely gratifying.”
Rogers will continue to hold her current position into the beginning of the next president’s term. Faust announced in June that she plans to step down at the conclusion of the academic year. A presidential search committee has spent the past nine months searching for a new leader.
Rogers said she chose to announce her departure now so it would not appear related to the presidential transition.
“The timing of the announcement was very deliberate—I wanted it announced before I had any sense of who the new president would be, and before I even had any sense of when it would be announced,” she said. “I just wanted to be sure it wasn't contiguous, so it didn't look like in some way that the new person and I didn't want to work together.”
The conclusion of the capital campaign was a natural moment to consider her next chapter, Rogers said.
"I've had this very, very, very long career here and so I would say certainly the end of the campaign was a marker that made me think about sort of the next step, the rest of my life so to speak,” she said.
Over the course of her more than 40 years at the University, Rogers said the nature of fundraising has shifted.
“A long time ago, well before my time, Harvard’s fundraising originated in the College with the creation of the Harvard College Fund and then each school had their own enterprise as well—and that’s still sort of the case, but we do much more collaboration,” she said. “Like so much that happens here, we’re building on the work of other people and we’re really fortunate to be able to do so.”
Rogers, who began her Harvard career as a History and Literature concentrator, said she expects to spend time volunteering, consulting, and reading 19th century novels.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sadé Abraham will serve as director of a new summer program geared toward first generation, low-income, and under-resourced freshmen after much campus-wide debate about developing such a program.
Abraham, who is currently pursuing a second degree from the Graduate School of Education, will oversee the yet-to-be-named program, with its pilot launch planned for the summer of 2018. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday evening.
The new pre-orientation option—which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced in August—followed Khurana’s rejection of the First Year Institute, a program designed specifically for low-income students, in March 2017. The First Year Institute was modeled closely after the First Year Enrichment Program, presented to the Undergraduate Council by Savannah N. Fritz ’17 in spring 2015.
The First Year Enrichment Program proposed that low-income students arrive early to campus to facilitate their adjustment to Harvard. Fritz's initiative suggested these students sit down with College administrators, speak with representatives from the Financial Aid Office and Office of Career Services, and meet with academic counselors before starting school.
Though the Freshman Dean’s Office has yet to announce the details of the new program, it is looking to utilize a student-run steering committee to “help shape and create the pre-orientation program in a way that matches the needs of the students,” according to an email from pre-orientation program chairs James A. Bedford ’20 and Andrew Perez ’20. The steering committee will meet weekly with Abraham and 20 student leaders will be selected in late August 2018 to help run the new program.
In its pilot, the four-day program is expected to serve approximately 100 incoming freshmen, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ‘67. It will be the sixth pre-orientation program available to incoming students, joining Dorm Crew’s Fall Clean-Up, the First-Year Arts Program, the First-Year International Program, the First-Year Outdoor Program, and the First-Year Urban Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Individual performances highlighted Harvard track and field’s latest trip across Beantown, this time to Northeastern. Competing in the Joe Donahue Games, it was the men’s sprinters that tore up the Reggie Lewis Track.
The Crimson was among five other team, including Hartford, Northeastern, Central Connecticut, Holy Cross, and UMass, to compete Friday afternoon. When all the events had finished, the group of athletes that represented Harvard earned third in the men’s division and fifth in the women’s. However, those competing did not represent the entire roster of the Crimson.
“[We had] so few girls because most competed last weekend and we will be having two meets next week, one very competitive at NY armory and one is HYP for which we need to field a full team,” co-captain Marlena Sabatino said. “Our team performed fine, but we are definitely still working up to the performances we are capable of. [The] meet overall was not extremely competitive.”
Senior Matt Hurst was the first man in crimson to run, and the second to cross the finish line in the 60-meter dash finals. The senior finished in a blistering 7.02 seconds, a .02 second improvement from his preliminary time.
The senior proceeded to take gold in his next race, the 200-meter. Finishing the half-lap in 22.56 seconds, Hurst was followed by three other Harvard sprinters. With co-captain Jay Hebert, freshman Rodney Agyare-May, and freshman Jovahn Williamson claiming second through fourth, respectively, the Crimson swept the top four spots in the sprint.
Meanwhile, the other men’s co-captain, junior Myles Marshall, was busy on the 400-meter. Marshall claimed the gold with the 48.13 second finish, shattering his personal record and achieving the second fastest indoor 400-meter time in school history.
Seven other Harvard sprinters ran a 400 on the weekend, only in the variant of two 4x400-meter relay teams. The two squads placed one, two in the race. The A group, represented by Agyare-May, Hurst, Williamson and Marshall, took the top spot with a 3:21.42 mile. The B group, finishing second in 3:23.59, was represented by junior Taylor Brunskole, junior Andrew Bolze, senior Alexander Moore, and freshman Kahlil Wassell. The A squad of Central Connecticut was the next fastest group, finishing just under four seconds behind both Crimson teams.
Freshman Ryan Thrush ran in the longest event of the afternoon for the Harvard men, the 500-meter. The first-year grabbed the silver medal with a 1:01.50 finish.
The 60-meter hurdles showcased Hebert once again, this time taking first in an 8:06 second sprint.
In the field, the men’s team wasn’t as successful as it had been in the short distances, but the team still managed to rake in some hardware.
Junior Andrew Bolze did the best of the athletes in the field, jumping seven meters on his fifth long jump attempt to come away with the gold medal. Sophomore Anthony DeNitto grabbed third with a jump only .14 meters behind his teammate’s.
The men’s vaulters managed to pull two medals from the event. Sophomore Ian West grabbed the bronze medal with a 4.65-meter jump while teammate, senior Matt Miller claimed fifth after leaping 4.50-meters.
Alternatively, the women’s vaulters swept the top spots in the event. Both Sabatino and junior Nicole Trenchard vaulted 3.50 meters in the event, however Trenchard did it on her first attempt, earning gold. Sabatino cleared the mark on her final attempt and as a result left with the silver medal.
“I was pretty disappointed with my performance this weekend,” Trenchard said. “My coach and I have made some pretty major technique changes, and in the process of putting the pieces together I made a few very basic mistakes. Things are coming along, but when it comes to the vertical jumps, it doesn't matter how good it looks if you knock the bar down.
“As frustrating as the experience was, this weekend was confirmation that I'm getting a bit closer to where I need to be to come Ivy League Championships,” Trenchard added. “I saw a lot of potential in how our group competed this weekend, but I know none of us will be satisfied until we put the bar higher. Let's talk in a few weeks—I think the story will be very different.”
The men’s team placed four through six in the weight throw. Sophomore Gunnar Allison led the pack with a toss of 15.16 meters, followed closely by freshmen teammates Jason Judge and Wesley Donhauser.
“We are all really looking forward to our home meets (Harvard vs.Yale vs. Princeton) next weekend, then Crimson Elite the week after,” Trenchard said. “This weekend was a great way for all of us to get ready however worked best for our training. While you miss the energy that comes from having your entire team there, it means that we will come into the next few competitions stronger.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It had been 46 days since either of the two fencing teams had stepped on a mat competitively prior to Saturday’s competition. Taking to the strips once again for the first time in a month and a half, Harvard traveled to Queens, N.Y., for the St. John’s Invitational, squaring off against some of the top ranked programs in the nation.
“Having been to the Invitational last year, I knew that it was going to be one of our more competitive tournaments this season, but I knew that the team was up for the challenge and excited to compete,” junior co-captain Sharon Ra said. “This meet is great preparation for Ivies, and allows us to compete at a very high level.”
The men’s squad (9-1) broke the long winter layoff in a dominating fashion, sweeping its opponents at the highly competitive meet. The women’s side (8-4), the second-lowest ranked team in attendance, won two matches and dropped three.
For the men’s side, the 5-0 performance shows a marked improvement from this point in the 2017 season, at which time the group was victorious in only a single matchup. The women matched their 2017 performance.
MEN’S FENCING
Junior co-captain, and 2016 United States Olympic team member, Eli Dershwitz headlined for the Crimson on Saturday. The junior tallied a 14-1 record on the afternoon, on top of a plus-38 touch differential. Against all five opponents, the only match in which Dershwitz did not defeat his opponent 3-0 was against No. 4 Penn State, in which he triumphed 2-1.
With Dershwitz, sabre won every match.
Against all opponents, No. 5 Harvard pulled the close matches, winning 14-13 against No. 8 St John’s, No. 2 Columbia, No. 2 Ohio State, and Penn State. It was only against the No. 1 squad in the country that the Crimson did better, pulling out the 15-12 victory against Notre Dame.
Boasting an 11-4 record on the day, sophomore Duncan Rheingans-Yoo lead the foil fencers to four victories and single loss. The Columbia, Md., native pulled a plus-nine touch differential, and 2-1 wins against all team excluding St. John’s. In his match against the host school, Rheingans-Yoo claimed a 3-0 win.
The epee trio proved most volatile on the afternoon, giving up four losses, and claiming their lone win against Notre Dame. Sophomore George Haglund highlighted the squad, taking a team second-best touch differential of plus-23, and registering a 9-3 record across the five matches.
“Last year our team faced many heartbreaking defeats at Saint John’s and Ivy League championships,” sophomore sabre Philippe Guy said. “These hardships made us work much harder in practice this year. I feel that the hard work and practice throughout the season truly paid off at this tournament where we were able to prevail in five extremely close matches. I think it’s a testament to our coaches, our captains, and the entire team that we were able to win at St. John’s this year.”
WOMEN’S FENCING
With No. 6 Harvard exactly replicating its 2017 performance, the opponents at the St. John’s Invitational proved as tough as they looked on paper.
The Crimson women’s squad first dismembered its host, No. 10 St. John’s. That 16-11 win was highlighted by a perfect performance on the part of the foil trio—junior Liana Henderson-Semel, co-captain MacKenzie Lawrence, and sophomore Natalie Yang. The group went 2-2 the rest of the afternoon.
“I was really proud of the intense energy we brought to each and every school we faced throughout the entirety of the Invitational,” Yang said. “The competitive atmosphere drove our resolve to fight for every touch every second of each bout”
Both No. 2 Columbia and No. 1 Notre Dame handed the team 9-18 losses, with sabre claiming a victory against the former, and epee against the latter.
That two-game slide was halted by a near perfect performance on the part of the epee trio against their No. 5 Ohio State competitors. Taking the match 7-2 in the epee division, and 5-4 finish in foil earned Harvard its second, and final victory of the Invitational, 14-13.
“Everyone was fighting hard for every touch,” Lawrence said. “That fighting spirit goes a long way and really speaks to the character and determination of each and every woman on this team.”
No. 3 Penn State finished the Crimson off, handing the group a 12-15 defeat. Foil earned a 5-4 victory, but the efforts of the rest of the team would prove not enough.
Now, the two teams turn an anticipatory eye toward the Feb. 10, Ivy League Championships.
“We have very talented fencers on the team, many of whom have competed and are still competing within the national and international circuit,” Ra said. “We are a small and close-knit team, and our supportive framework gives us an extra edge towards success, and hopefully helps us claim the Ivy League Championship title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its toughest opponent so far this season in No. 4 Stanford on a Sunday matinee, women’s squash completed a weekend sweep against cross-coast colleges after winning the day before against No. 19 Tufts.
No. 1 Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) has yet to drop an individual match this year, winning both contests 9-0 in dominant fashion. In the last five matchups, Harvard has only dropped a total of two games across all the team’s individual matches.
This weekend was supposed to mark the beginning to Harvard’s more challenging part of the schedule, facing two ranked teams, including one in the top five. While the play might have been tighter on the court, the results show unquestioned dominance.
HARVARD 9, STANFORD 0
Last year women’s squash travelled to Palo Alto at the end of a four-game road trip against three teams ranked in the top-five. Harvard got a reprieve this year, playing host to the Cardinal as it went on its own weekend jaunt across the country.
The unfortunate reality of playing a sport almost exclusive to the East Coast while on the West Coast is the frequent weekend cross-country flights and single-day double-hitters. After playing at Williams College, against Williams and Cornell, the team faced a drive from Western Massachusetts and a date with Dartmouth and defending national champions, Harvard.
Despite the logistical disadvantages Stanford faced, Harvard was careful to not approach the match complacently, especially with top player and junior Sabrina Sobhy absent as she joined her sister Sabrina Sobhy ’15 in New York at the Tournament of Champions.
“I think that most of the time the pressure is on us because we are seeded one,” said No. 5 senior and co-captain Sue Ann Yong. “So going into every single match with always these sorts of nerves—everyone’s out to get you.”
A focus on mental fortitude has long been a staple of Harvard squash. Visualization and other focus methods are used, and these tools will be more and more important as the team goes against tougher opponents.
With focus in place, Harvard was able to run by its cross-country adversary in relatively easy fashion.
“Stanford got a lot better this year and it’s our toughest match so far so I think that we were all preparing mentally, ready for a good battle,” said No. 6 sophomore Eleonore Evans. “I think we all handled it all pretty well, stayed pretty steady, and just stayed inside the court.”
Harvard jumped up to a commanding start in the first round of games, denying even a game from Stanford. While most of Harvard’s players cruised through in three easy games, Evans fought through an early first-game tiebreaker, 17-15, to continue the flawless afternoon.
Eventually No. 9 sophomore Annika Engstrom fell in her first game to disrupt the streak of 3-0 victories, but soon rallied to win in four games.
HARVARD 9, TUFTS 0
Harvard’s northern neighbor has never had a decent chance against its Cambridge host, and Saturday was no different. All games were decided in three games and the Mehta sisters (senior Alyssa and junior Sophie) were each able to pick up a bagel in one of their games.
The results have been unsurprising so far this season. The easier competition gives the team the opportunity to ease into competition and prepare for the tougher matchups down the road.
“The first half of the Ivy season has been good,” Evans said. “Our matches have been more spread out so we’ve had more recovery time and practice and prepare for our matches. Now we have a straight three weeks until nationals so it’s going to be a grind on the body and on our minds. But we just have to stay focused, keep up with the visualizing, keep up with the mental preparation.”
The squash season moves quickly and the team will look to stay consistent, because it’s hard to do any better on the scorecard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An explosive start, bolstered by sophomore guard Katie Benzan’s 17 first-half points, anchored Harvard women’s basketball in its 76-65 victory over Dartmouth Saturday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The win splits the season series 1-1 with the Big Green in the Crimson’s first home Ivy League game of the season, making Harvard 6-0 at home this season.
“I think today was our first good game of 40 solid, good minutes,” Benzan said. “[We had] good intensity, good defense, patience on offense, so it was good to have a solid full 40 minutes tonight.”
An early offensive burst allowed the Crimson (9-6, 1-1 Ivy) to take the lead only 7:22 into the match, a lead Harvard would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.
The run began 20 seconds into the contest when junior co-captain Madeline Raster drilled a three from the corner. The Crimson then proceeded to snag five offensive rebounds in the first four minutes, dominating the glass.
Dartmouth (9-6, 1-1) wasn’t done yet. The team compensated and reversed course, earing the early 9-5 lead for the Big Green. Benzan answered with a layup and three-pointer. Dartmouth refused to be overpowered and jumped back on top 16-13. Harvard answered with an 11-0 run.
Sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm struck first, returning the Crimson to within one with a layup. From that point, Harvard nailed three-straight shots from beyond the arc. Benzan hit first, this time from the left wing. On the ensuing possession following a steal by sophomore Jeannie Boehm, Benzan nailed her fourth three-pointer of the first quarter. She would finish the first half going 5-6 from beyond the arc.
“We made major adjustments to what we did offensively in the first game against Dartmouth,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We shared the ball and we weren’t as impatient, and when we make decisions a little more slowly when we have the ball we can find all kinds of scorers, because we have scorers on this team.”
Raster capped off the offensive quarter with a deep three-pointer at the buzzer to give the Crimson a 24-16 lead, ending the quarter on an 11-0 run. Harvard hit six three-pointers in the opening frame, accounting for 75 percent of its points.
The Crimson extended its run into the second quarter, with junior guard Sydney Skinner hitting a layup and three-pointer, capping off the 16-0 run for Harvard. On the next trip down the court, Skinner knocked down her second straight three.
“We just shared the ball really well and found the open person no matter who it was,” Benzan said. “That’s how we got great shots every possession.”
Things got dicey for the Crimson in the second quarter when the Big Green posted a quick 5-0 run of their own. The momentum was short-lived, however, following yet another three-pointer from Skinner. Benzan would follow up with a three of her own to stretch the lead to 42-26, Harvard’s biggest lead of the half.
Prior to the break, Dartmouth was able to chip away at the Crimson’s lead, making it 46-36 at the end of the first half.
The match was shooting heavy for both Benzan and Skinner, both of whom eclipsed 20 points on the game. For Benzan, it was the second time this season that she reached the 20-point mark in a matchup. Boehm achieved her third triple double on the season with 16 points and 14 rebounds.
It was on rebounds that the Crimson outpaced the Big Green the most. Harvard managed 41 to Dartmouth’s 26. From that, the team dominated in second chance points, with one more than double Dartmouth’s 13, and fast break points, 6-0.
While the Crimson dominated from beyond the arc in the first quarter, the halftime break allowed the Big Green to adjust its defense. Throughout the third quarter, Benzan was scoreless and Harvard did not manage to net a single three-point shot.
Despite this embargo on the long-range buckets, the Crimson managed to win the points battle in the third quarter. The team hit first with quick baskets from Boehm and senior co-captain Kirby Porter.
“The team was so unselfish and it was all the blue-collar work that I’m looking for,” Delaney-Smith said.
Dartmouth would answer with a pair of threes to cut the lead to single digits, the score 52-44 Harvard.
The defense finally got itself together in the final stanza of play, with neither team earning a point for a full one minute and 57 seconds.
The Big Green broke the drought with a jump shot from Isalys Quinones. Skinner added a layup before Benzan netted her first points of the second half on her sixth three-pointer of the night to give Harvard an 11 point lead. Skinner would steal the ball at the top of the key and finish the layup herself on the other end to extend the Crimson’s lead to 13, 71-58.
The two teams netted 12 points apiece in the final quarter of play, leaving Harvard with 11-point victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly a week after suffering its first defeat of the season to No. 4 Columbia, No. 2 Harvard men’s squash bounced back in dominant fashion. Eight of the nine matches played over the weekend were quick three-game sweeps, and in each of those bouts, the result was never really in question upon completion of the first game.
Facing off against No. 12 Western Ontario for the fifteenth time in team history, the Crimson (5-1, 2-1 Ivy) routinely took care of business at the Murr Center by sweeping their Canadian opponent, 9-0. With the win, Harvard extended its current win streak against the Mustangs (7-2, 0-0 Ontario University Athletics Conference) to fourteen straight matches.
The 9-0 triumph was the Crimson’s fifth such victory of the season, having bested No. 10 Dartmouth, No. 22 MIT, No. 3 St. Lawrence, and No. 15 Cornell in similar fashion. According to members of the squad, the win was an important step in recovering from last weekend’s road loss.
“I think today’s match was an important match for us to bounce back mentally from Columbia,” freshman Sam Scherl said. “I think [the team’s performance against] Columbia was unfortunate as many players had an off day, and it’s easy to start doubting the team’s ability. However, today was really about proving to ourselves that we’re a strong team and can refocus for the rest of the season. I think everyone really increased their intensity and focus for today’s match and really wanted to show a strong performance.”
While sporting its fifth different line-up combination this season, Harvard proved that it was the better team from top to bottom. Scherl, sophomore Sean Hughes, and senior Bradley Smith energetically led the charge from the outset, each pushing around their opponents to win the first wave, 3-0. Similar steadiness was present in many of the other performances by the Crimson squad throughout the rest of the day.
“The team performed well today and we were all professional in our matches,” junior Alexi Gosset said. “Western [Ontario] has some talented players, but we had the upper hand physically. We wore down our opponents and controlled the play to get the win today.”
Gosset, a Toronto, Ontario native, made his second appearance of the season against Western Ontario. In doing so, he picked up his second three-game victory on the year—11-3, 11-6, 11-1. Sophomore Saadeldin Abouaish, freshman Adam Corcoran, co-captain Madhav Dhingra, and co-captain David Ryan took care of business with relative ease in their second and third wave matches, as well.
Of the Harvard players, only sophomore Timmy Brownell failed to blank his Mustangs opponent. At the outset, Brownell’s match at the second position seemed to be destined to finish just like the others, as he jumped out to an early lead, 11-5, 11-6, against Western Ontario sophomore Matthew Henderson. But Henderson picked up his level of play in the third game and eventually pulled even with the Belmont, Mass. native to force a fifth set. Brownell refused to let the match slip away, however, by taking over the bout in the final frame.
“Timmy had a tough match today, but battled like the warrior he is,” Gosset said. “He won the first two games without too much trouble but then his opponent started playing very well and levelled the match at 2-2. Timmy came out strong in the last game and used his experience to get the win. He hasn’t been feeling his best physically lately but is regaining confidence in his movement to get back to top form.”
After claiming such a commanding victory over another ranked team, the Crimson looks to prove to continue to perform to its self-perceived standard in the weeks ahead with the CSA Team National Championships just a month away. For Harvard, this weekend’s achievement was merely a single step in the process.
“Last week’s loss was unexpected and was a bit of a wakeup call for us,” Gosset said. “We are using it as motivation to come back stronger than ever and show all our opponents how tough we will be to beat. The team definitely wanted to make a statement today and get back on track with a good performance all around.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday’s meet had a double significance for the No. 21 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team. Taking place at the Crimson’s Blodgett Pool, the competition offered Harvard the chance to complete a sixth-straight season undefeated at home in dual meets. Entering the matchup, the Crimson hadn’t been beaten in Cambridge during the regular season since a 2012 loss to Princeton.
In addition, as the final home meet of the campaign, this weekend’s meet provided an opportunity for the team’s 10 seniors to close out their careers at Blodgett with a win.
In the end, Harvard met both goals with ease. The Crimson (7-0, 4-0 Ivy) took on Bryant (6-2, 1-1 MAAC) and Rider (5-3, 3-0 MAAC) on senior night and downed its opponents, 218-81 and 223-76, respectively. The victory sees the Crimson remain undefeated not just at home, but across all dual meets this season.
“The team did really well today,” sophomore Raphael Marcoux said. “It's always a challenge to get up and race after training through J-term, but despite that obstacle everyone managed to swim fast.”
The win was a fitting send-off for a group of seniors that has never lost at Blodgett and has dropped just one out of the 35 regular-season races it has contested so far. Indeed, it was performances from Harvard’s most experienced athletes that highlighted the competition.
The Crimson kicked the matchup off with a victory from an all-senior lineup in the 200-yard medley relay. Koya Osada, Paul O’Hara, co-captain Luke Morgan Scott, and Ed Kim took top marks in the event with a time of 1:30.72. Finishing just over a tenth of a second behind the winning A squad, the B entry of senior Steven Tan, juniors Sebastian Lutz and Alan Lam, and Marcoux ended up in second place.
Harvard would also close out the contest with a relay victory from a lineup of seniors. Morgan-Scott, O’Hara, Tan, and Kent Haeffner touched the wall first in the 400-yard freestyle relay. A much younger squad consisting of freshmen Levente Bathory, Mahlon Reihman, and Eric Whisenant and junior Daniel Tran finished in second, four seconds ahead of the third-place lineup from Rider.
With the meet bookended by victories, the Crimson’s seniors delivered a number of strong performances throughout the competition. In the second race of the day, the 1000-yard freestyle, Haeffner picked up a second-place result, touching the wall behind junior Brennan Novak and just ahead of sophomore Daniel Chang in third. Chang beat out the fourth-place finisher from Rider by more than 30 seconds.
Osada also collected a solo podium finish, ending up in third in the 200 freestyle. Sophomore Dean Farris took top honors in the event with a time of 1:35.11. Farris would pick up another individual victory in the 200-yard backstroke, topping the second-place swimmer from Rider by nearly seven seconds.
Elsewhere, Morgan-Scott matched Osada’s effort, also taking third in the 100 free, less than half a second behind Chang, who touched the wall second. The co-captain finished in fourth in the 100-yard butterfly as well. Sophomore Kevin Dai ended up in third in the event, outpaced by less than three seconds by race-winner Marcoux.
“My best performance of the meet was definitely the 100 butterfly,” Marcoux said. “A big challenge for me this season has been figuring out what my third event will be at Ivies, the other two being the 50 and 100 freestyle, and after that race I'm pretty confident it will be the 100 butterfly.”
Tan also added a third-place result to the seniors’ collection on the day, finishing in bronze position in the 200-yard IM. Tran won the event and beat out the second-place finisher from Rider by nearly four seconds.
The Crimson veterans’ strong performances in the pool were more than matched on the boards. Co-captain Bobby Ross won both the one-meter and three-meter dives by commanding margins, posting scores of 332.55 and 376.50 in the events, respectively. Senior David Pfeifer was close behind Ross, collecting a second-place result in the three-meter and a third-place mark in the one-meter. Freshman Austin Fields rounded out the Harvard podium sweep in both events. The rookie traded places with Pfeifer, finishing second in the one-meter and third in the three-meter.
As in the diving events, the Crimson’s seniors had some help throughout the meet from the team’s younger members.
Junior Logan Houck racked up a pair of solo wins in the 200-yard butterfly and 500 freestyle. The Harvard rookie duo of freshmen Michael Zarian and Miles McAllister took the next two spots in the 500 free, with Zarian nine seconds behind Houck and McAllister 13 seconds back from his classmate.
Zarian also contributed to an impressive showing from the team’s first-years in the 100-yard backstroke. Whisenant won the event with a mark of 49.80 seconds, and Bathory was close behind in third place, with Zarian taking fourth.
Reihman got in on the solo success as well, finishing with the third-best time in the 50-yard freestyle, a mere two-hundredths of a second behind Rider senior Zachary Molloy in second. Lutz touched the wall ahead of Molloy to win the event.
Lutz would also go on to claim second-place honors in the 200 breaststroke, outpacing third-place Lam by three-tenths of a second. Dai mirrored Lutz’s effort in the 100-yard iteration, finishing in second place.
With another win to its name, the Crimson will turn its attention to the championship portion of its season. The team will battle for the regular-season Ivy League dual title when it takes on Yale and Princeton, the only other program still undefeated in the Ancient Eight.
“I think our team as a whole did very well [against Bryant and Rider], considering many of us are still in the height of our season,” Dai said. “We demonstrated in this meet that we can swim well in any circumstances, in any events, and that puts us in a great position both mentally and physically for HYP and Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a promising start against Howard University in the books for the Harvard women’s tennis team by Friday evening in Washington, D.C., the squad looked to be firing on all cylinders.
But after the weekend was completed, the Crimson (1-2) proved that it was unable to capitalize on its fast start. Competitive losses against Maryland (1-0) and George Washington (1-0) took away the momentum generated during Harvard’s 7-0 sweep of the Bison (0-1).
The top three spots of the lineup are where the Crimson put forth its most promising results over the matches. Playing at the top slot for the first time in her dual career for Harvard, sophomore Jenna Friedel posted a winning record over the weekend, 2-1. Sophomore Irene Lu and captain Annika Ringblom played to similar finishes at the second and third positions, respectively.
While the Crimson’s returners tended to shine brighter in the nation’s capital, the squad’s rookies still played a significant role in the first set of dual match action of their college careers.
“We have had a lot of good hitting this weekend, especially from the freshmen for whom this was their first team match,” Lu said. “I am excited to watch our team improve from week to week and see what is in store for us in the future. I think this weekend was a good test for the team and gave us a taste of close matches we may have during the rest of the season.”
MARYLAND 5, HARVARD 2
Upon completion of its contests against the Colonials and Bison, Harvard traveled to College Park, Md., to face off against the Terrapins. Maryland demonstrated that it was the Crimson’s most difficult opponent of the weekend road trip, barreling its way to a decisive 5-2 victory.
While the final score was the more definitive result of Harvard’s two losses, the individual games were quite contested. Unlike any of the previous two days’ matches, two of the Crimson’s singles contests against the Terrapins went the full distance. Ringblom fell to Maryland junior Millie Stretton in a third-set tiebreaker, while freshman Neha Gupta won her bout against Terrapins sophomore Kate Yemelyanenka, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.
Gupta and fellow rookie Jenna Moustafa were in fact the only two members to earn points in their singles matches on the day. Similar to Ringblom, Friedel and Lu suffered losses against their Maryland counterparts. Friedel’s defeat was more contested than that of Lu given that she was able to force two tiebreakers in her two-set match. Freshman Anna Li also fell in straight sets to her opponent.
On the doubles side of things, the Crimson lost two of its three bouts. The duo of Ringblom and Li failed to complete their match given that the ultimate doubles result became obvious before its conclusion. The Ringblom and Li partnership has proven to be successful for Harvard with the pairing having tallied a 9-2 record so far between the dual and tour seasons.
GEORGE WASHINGTON 4, HARVARD 3
George Washington winning two out of the three doubles matches to collect the event’s first point proved to be crucial in its matchup against the Crimson, as the two squads split the singles portion of the contest, 3-3.
Sophomore Natasha Gonzalez and junior Isabel Jasper were unsuccessful against the Colonials’ pairing of Kamilla Beisenova and Diana Kussainova. They fell quite decidedly, 6-1. Lu and Moustafa were closer to victory in their own 6-4 defeat, but Ringblom and Li were ultimately the only duo win in the meet and did so in tiebreaking fashion, 7-6 (5-0).
In singles, Harvard triumphed at the top three spots of the ladder with Friedel, Lu, and Ringblom each winning in straight sets, while the Colonials proved victorious at positions four through six. Given that Ringblom is the only senior on the squad, the strength of Friedel and Lu’s play at the top will be crucial for the Crimson going forward. According to Ringblom, the duo is off to a good start.
“Irene and Jenna are great role models to the incoming freshmen on how to run down every ball and support all of their teammates even during big points,” Ringblom said. “Since they are only sophomores, I am very excited to see them grow as players this season and the next two years.”
HARVARD 7, HOWARD 0
In its first competitive action of the spring season, Harvard put forth a strong all-around performance against Howard. By the end of the day on Friday, the Crimson had claimed its first sweep since its victory over Providence in March of last year, 7-0. While the group certainly achieved a significant accomplishment, some shine should be taken off the win with Harvard’s path to success having been aided by two Bison forfeitures.
In the singles portion of the event, Ringblom kicked off her winning weekend with one of the more dominant victories of her Crimson career. Playing at the third position, the Palos Verdes Estates, Calif. native blanked Howard senior Sajela Harlow, 6-0, 6-0.
“Annika started this weekend with a bang,” Lu said. “She opened with a strong win over Howard, the first singles win of the season for the team. Annika continued to play at a high level throughout the weekend against George Washington and Maryland. She has been moving and hitting some of the best balls I have seen from her, and I am excited to see this momentum carry through the rest of the spring.”
Friedel, Gonzalez, Gupta, and Lu continued the trend for Harvard, each cruising to straight set victories against their respective opponents. The squad also collected its doubles point without much fuss, as it was undefeated in that portion of the match, as well.
The duos of Ringblom and Li and Mustafa and Lu both bested their Bison opponents in identical fashion, 6-2. Harvard’s final doubles match was a non-event, however, as Jasper and Gonzalez won by forfeit. Moustafa’s singles victory was also a forfeiture and helped the Crimson pick up its seventh and final point of the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing a difficult stretch of games against top opponents, Harvard women’s hockey dropped consecutive contests to No. 10 St. Lawrence and No. 2/2 Clarkson this weekend. The pair of home losses pushed the Crimson’s losing streak to six games.
“Although we didn’t get the four points for the two games, I think we were playing our best hockey this year,” junior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “But we also need to recognize that it wasn’t a win, and down the stretch we’re looking for as many points as we can to make the playoffs.”
ST. LAWRENCE 3, HARVARD 0
In Saturday’s matchup, the Saints (14-7-3, 10-3-1 ECAC) pitched a shutout, holding Harvard scoreless for just the second time on the season.
The Crimson (8-10-1, 6-7-1) tallied more shots on goal and won more faceoffs than St. Lawrence, but the Saints took advantage of several prime scoring opportunities and corralled Harvard’s offensive attack all afternoon.
“Sometimes we have possession of the puck in the offensive zone, but we’re playing too much on the perimeter of the zone instead of taking the puck directly to the net,” junior forward Bradley Fusco said.
St. Lawrence senior forward Hannah Miller assisted linemate Kennedy Marchment twice, once in the opening period and once in the third. The goals marked the third straight game that Marchment found the back of the net twice.
Waiting 14 minutes into the first period, Miller slung a pass across the crease and Marchment redirected it off the back crossbar. Initially, the play was not ruled a goal, and Miller scored 20 seconds later. Upon review, however, Marchment was given scoring credit.
The duo reconnected 7:18 into the closing period to put the game on ice for the Saints.
Marchment’s first goal was the difference-maker, but St. Lawrence kept the pressure on in the second frame. Just 1:57 after the intermission, sophomore defender Dakota Golde secured a pass from sophomore forward Kayla Vespa. Golde fought her way to the net and snuck a shot past Crimson sophomore goalie Beth Larcom.
“We need to find a way to put the puck in the net, and hopefully that’ll come, but we did have a tough stretch with a bunch of good teams that we were playing,” Fusco said.
CLARKSON 3, HARVARD 1
On Friday night, Harvard showed some resistance against ECAC powerhouse Clarkson (21-3-1, 12-2-0), but the Golden Knights got out to an early lead and would not relinquish its advantage all game.
“It’s been a trend for the past couple of games where we’re down 1-0, 2-0 and then we start scoring, so we need to come out right from the start ready to go and attack the net,” Tse said. “We battled with Clarkson, we battled with St. Lawrence, but they capitalized and they just found a way to score.”
Early in the third period, the Crimson had its best chance at a comeback. Clarkson had built a 2-0 lead with a goal in each of the first two periods, but it had not scored in over 18 minutes. Harvard battled for possession in the neutral zone and eventually controlled the puck behind the net. Co-captain Haley Mullins dished the puck to Tse out in front of the crease, and Tse poked the puck in for her second goal of the season.
Though the Crimson had quickly launched itself back into contention after a sluggish start, the Golden Knights silenced any doubts just as quickly. Only 2:33 after Tse’s tally, sophomore forward Michaela Pejzlova received a backhanded pass from junior forward Loren Gabel and laced a shot past Larcom’s blocker to put Clarkson up, 3-1.
Pejzlova and Gabel were the Golden Knights’ standout performers, as they collectively earned five points. Pejzlova picked up assists on Clarkson’s other two scores, and Gabel scored the visitors’ second goal at the 7:08 mark in the second frame.
The Golden Knights had many chances to make the game a blowout, but Harvard’s penalty kill held the visiting team in check. The Crimson faced six shorthanded situations and shut down Clarkson’s attack each time.
“They have one of the leading power plays in the country right now…so to not have them score I think that gives us confidence,” Tse said. “But also we’ve got to stay out of the box.”

Being back on campus means we’re back to life, back to reality, and back to cringe-worthy small-talk with peers. Your conversational options are pretty much a) the weather, b) the weather wherever you went for break, or c) the status of your thesis topic and progress.
I would rather talk about Boston winters for the rest of college than speak to another person about “how my thesis is going.” Either I’m having a bad day and your question will set off the tears I’ve been holding in since I got to Widener at 9:07a.m., or I’m having a good day, and you’ve got me revved up about my topic. And since we both know you don’t really want to hear my analysis of a particular quote from a 1940s radical feminist memoir that will certainly win me the Hoopes, I’ll probably end up crying in that circumstance too. I’ve shaved years off my life expectancy worrying over something that will make your eyes glaze over before you’re even finished asking about it.
If you’re still urgently interested in how I am or some other pleasantries you think may sugar-coat your inevitable question about my thesis, let me just tell you about all I accomplished over break:
I downloaded Candy Crush. I play it more than your one weird aunt ever did in 2010. I see it when I close my eyes in the wee hours of the morning.
I’ve watched the entirety of The Great British Baking Show. Multiple times. I’ve attempted to make puff pastry and started a fight with my mom about how much butter I can purchase and still be “healthy.”
Speaking of healthy, I’ve started working out. I’ve been on campus for the last two weeks and I’ve been to the MAC more times during this period than the entire rest of college combined. All I’ve learned is that the gym is an even sadder place to be stressed than the library, because everyone else who shows up to the gym at 6 a.m. is really excited to be awake and sporty.
Now that others who aren’t thesising are starting to get back to campus, I’ve actually interacted with people (outside of the silent nod when we’re both scanning the reading room in Widener). This would be nice if not for every one of these interactions involving some inquiry about my thesis. As if I haven’t spent every waking moment of the past two “winter break” weeks (plus most sleeping moments—shoutout to my thesis nightmares) anxiously working on it or guiltily procrastinating working on it.
For God’s, Anaïs Nin’s, and my sake, please stop asking me about my thesis. It’s terrible and scary and I don't want to think about it even when I’m working on it. Any interaction with a human who isn’t my advisor is blocked off in my GCal is a break, so when you ask me about it, don’t be surprised if I ignore you and blab about Mary Berry instead.

“Hebrew Bible is dead. Hebrew Bible remains dead. And we have killed it.” -Friedrich Nietzsche
The beloved GPA booster is losing its General Education eligibility status next semester, and we are all terribly saddened by its departure from future transcripts. If you’re one of the many savants that devoted four grueling, nose-to-the-grindstone months of blood, sweat, and tears to the academic rollercoaster that is CB23, you’re aware that the first half of this sentence was total nonsense. With a mean workload of 2.5 hours, Hebrew Bible was a beacon of hope for students aiming to lessen their academic burden.
There were two types of people who took Hebrew Bible. They are best embodied by the following two (actual) Q reviews: “This course is great. You learn about the relationship between Christianity and Judaism, which was a fairly interesting topic for me as well as pretty useful for life in general.” and “it's as easy as everyone says it is lol.”
Professor Shaye J. D. Cohen acknowledges the borderline cult following behind his course within the first five minutes of the first day of his class. More admirably, he brings the same enthusiasm to the rest of the semester’s lectures, despite their notoriously poor attendance. He embraces the reputation of the course, and allows students to take it without fear of divine judgement for taking the “easy way” out of the Culture and Belief Gen Ed requirement. Although we presume that enrollment may decline in the fall, we must give credit where it is due: Cohen dealt with the insane variety of students that (sometimes) showed up to his class—from those who watched full seasons of Friends in the back of Emerson 105, to those in the front row who asked questions because they didn’t do as well on the midterm as they expected to.
Regardless of what the future holds for Hebrew Bible, we can only reflect on its time in the General Education department with gratitude. Thank you for giving our GPAs hope, Professor Cohen. Our unaware parents and future employers will never realize your contribution to our inflated grades and false academic qualifications.
