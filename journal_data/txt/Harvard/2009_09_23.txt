The city of Hull, Mass., has constructed two large wind turbines along its coast. These wind turbines provide 11 percent of Hull’s electricity needs per year. The city of Hull is also planning to build an offshore wind farm. If completed, these wind turbines could provide more than 90 percent of Hull’s electricity needs. 
The city of Cambridge should pursue a renewable wind-energy strategy that mimicks the successes of the city of Hull. There is no reason why Cambridge cannot receive 20 or 30 percent of its energy from offshore wind farms. However, it is clear that Cambridge and Hull are differently situated. Building an offshore wind farm that provides renewable energy for Cambridge will require another strategy.  
To this end, Cambridge should consider forming a “Wind Alliance” with surrounding municipalities. The purpose of this Wind Alliance is to pool the resources of Cambridge, the state government, the federal government, the private renewable-energy sector, and other municipalities to build wind farms off the coast in areas of high wind potential.   
There are many benefits associated with such a project. Offshore wind farms will provide clean energy to the city of Cambridge and surrounding municipalities. As a consequence, wind farms will substantially reduce the region’s carbon dioxide emissions. Also, the costs of fossil fuels are volatile and subject to increasing world demand: By deriving more energy from wind farms, residents will be protected from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Another key benefit is that the construction of an offshore wind farm would serve as a form of economic stimulus to the region. In particular, the project will provide opportunities for long-lasting employment across a range of skills and occupations. 
Certainly, a project of this size poses many challenges. The financing of projects of this magnitude requires careful planning. There must be coordination between all levels of government and the private energy sector. Of greatest importance is the choice of site. Still, the possibility exists for Cambridge and other municipalities to construct multiple wind farms in the outer reaches of Boston Harbor.
Recently, the administration of Deval L. Patrick ’78 presented a draft wind-energy plan. This plan would allow wind farms to be constructed in state waters along the coast, away from environmentally sensitive areas. The federal government is also actively supporting wind projects throughout the country. Plus, the Waxman-Markey bill—if passed—will cap carbon dioxide emissions. The blueprint for wind-energy production has been put in place. It is time to start making more definite plans. 
Tonight, the Cambridge City Council will meet to discuss climate change and greenhouse-gas emissions. In my opinion, now is the time for the city to consider an offshore wind farm. By constructing offshore wind farms in the outer reaches of Boston Harbor, the region will position itself to meet the requirements of the pending Waxman-Markey bill—or other future federal legislation that caps greenhouse-gas emissions.   
An offshore wind farm for Cambridge also makes good financial sense. Instead of purchasing and burning fossil fuels to produce energy and greenhouse gas emissions, Cambridge can receive clean energy indefinitely with no fuel costs. In fact, the city of Hull’s initial investment in a wind turbine was paid off in five years—in large part through savings in fuel costs. Cambridge will save money in the long term by investing in an offshore wind farm.  
The city of Cambridge collects, treats, and distributes its own water to residents; we successfully utilize our watershed on a daily basis. Why shouldn’t we receive our energy from nearby winds? A local approach to generating power is ultimately more sustainable. It is better than importing and burning fossil fuels. 
Offshore wind farms are common in Europe. The town of Hull has successfully operated municipal wind turbines for several years. Cambridge and other municipalities can do so too, with careful thought and planning.

Supermarket shoppers perusing the publication rack must have felt a dose of Weltschmerz as they waited for their frozen peas to be scanned. “Is God Dead?” read the Apr. 8, 1966, cover of Time Magazine, rendering the question in red typeface on a stark black background. The Nietzschean challenge emerged in the context of an immense cultural despair. Faced with a world so complex, so seemingly contradictory, a vocal group of American theologians—described in the magazine’s lead story—was seeking to radically re-envision a Christianity without a divine being.
The ’60s are over (as are the days when Time dared run such provocative covers). Replace “God” with “genius,” though, and the impertinent question remains just as pertinent. Last Thursday, Harvard’s Center for European Studies hosted a talk titled “On Genius and Geniuses in the Eighteenth Century.” At ease at the head of the Cabot Room’s oval table, a tan, tweed-clad Florida State professor delved into the religious and cultural roots of Enlightenment conceptions of “genius.” But throughout the presentation, the unspoken question hovered: Does the idea of genius still exist today?
The answer, at least in the traditional sense, is a troubling “no.” It’s true that “genius” has become a catch-all term of praise for everything from violin playing to political strategy. Yet modern understanding of the word is best explicated by rapper and self-proclaimed genius Kanye West, as good a barometer of the cultural zeitgeist as any: “If you read books—which I don’t, none at all—about how to become a billionaire, they always say, ‘You learn more from your mistakes.’ So if you learn from your mistakes, then I’m a fucking genius.” In response to a Rolling Stone interviewer’s request for a definition of genius, West added that “if you have a series of genius moments, then you can be considered a genius.”
Learning from mistakes, attempting to repeat one’s successes: Those sound more like accessible middle-class values than like the innate inspiration or providential favor once attributed to exceptional persons. Indeed, as much as Americans treasure the idea of genius—“Baby Genius” and “Baby Einstein” CD lines offer ambitious mothers-to-be the chance to transform their prenatals into intellectuals—we shy away from the suggestion of any hidden Mozarts in our midst.
The hesitancy makes sense. For a handful of chosen ones to walk among us with a greater potential to create things of worth doesn’t mesh terribly well with our country’s democratic values, after all. New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell tapped into just this everyman conception of genius in last year’s bestselling pop science book, “Outliers.” Reaching the top levels of a chosen field, he explained, simply requires a combination of hard work and luck—with a minimum of 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can be a winner.
But while this feel-good democratization is politically correct, it fails in practice. Populist American optimism tends to cut the legs out from beneath potent terms like “genius”; the harsh truth is that not everyone is capable of producing works of incredible beauty or sublimity. In the Coen brothers’ 1991 movie “Barton Fink,” a studio boss dresses down his star scripter: “You think you’re the only writer who can give me that Barton Fink feeling? I got 20 writers under contract that I can ask for a Fink-type thing from.” Yes, but there’s only one Barton Fink.
Still, that doesn’t mean we should return to the days of divine right. There’s a way to conserve the idea of genius without succumbing to elitism. Rather than maintain the illusion that with due diligence anyone can be a superstar, we should argue that any of us could be the one harboring that hidden genius potential. Who knows who might be considered a genius retrospectively? Probably not the grind with the flashcards.
At any rate, as writers over the centuries have realized, “genius” is ultimately a great consolation in itself. Just as the notion of a religious god continues to haunt much secular Western literature and art, the idea of genius—no matter how bankrupt—continues to make itself felt in the modern creative process. It reassures us that not everyone is destined to be merely a bit player, a secondary source, a “Fink-type.” Julia Kristeva put it best: genius is a “therapeutic invention that prevents us from dying from equality in a world without a hereafter.” So criticize the concept of genius, debate its meaning—but let’s not write its obituary.

If you’ve ever been on an endless hunt for, say, a classic Elizabeth Bowen novel that hasn’t seen shelves since before 1923, then the Harvard Book Store might be just the place for you. Beginning this Friday, customers can use the store’s new “Espresso Book Machine” to select a book from millions of titles now in the public domain that will be printed and bound right on the spot, presumably akin to the way that a coffee machine instantly fills a cup of coffee. Needless to say, the new machine, which works in conjunction with Google Books, is a fantastic innovation as useful as it is unbelievable.
This new piece of technology enables readers to access a vast pool of texts exponentially larger than the number of books currently crowding the shelves of the Harvard Book Store, especially those titles published pre-1923, before which copyright protections are largely inapplicable. Now, the number of unavailable, out-of-print books has—at least for customers of the Harvard Book Store and the few other nationwide stores with Espresso Book Machines—significantly diminished, and many obscure books can be accessed without the labyrinth of used booksellers and the obligatory weeks of waiting and searching.
But what is perhaps most intriguing about the book machine, however, is that it is both a technological advancement and a means of increasing access to print media, which is almost never the case with the other developments in this field. In the age of the e-book and the Amazon Kindle, it is refreshing to see the actual object of the book itself revived and sustained rather than replaced and forgotten. That said, the increased access to books—especially to more seasoned titles—that the machine creates will appeal to an older generation of readers that never embraced online technology in the first place. With this new machine, nothing is lost as a result of a technological transition. If anything, the printed book, still the fundamental core of reading for many, is better preserved.
Of course the Harvard Book Store’s “Espresso Book Machine” is an easy thing to criticize. After all, is it a solution to the print media crisis or to the problem of reading in the information age? Hardly—no matter how innovative the machine may be, its novelty must not distract us from the goal of making more texts available online. Isn’t it flawed? Absolutely—it would be nice if arrangements could be made with authors and publishers to include copyrighted materials in its catalogue. But no one has billed this machine as anything else but what it really is—an incredible device that affords readers access to an extraordinary array of titles previously unavailable with such speed and in such quantity. Instead of faulting the “Espresso Book Machine” for the questions it does not answer, skeptics should realize the magnitude of the services this machine does provide, and we admire the Harvard Book Store for being among the first to invest in such an innovative piece of technology.

On Tuesday, two of the world’s most important men—U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao—shared the spotlight at the UN Summit on Climate Change to speak about taking steps to combat climate change. The headliners of a group of over 100 leaders, both presidents spoke of the importance of the upcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s December meeting in Copenhagen. While the message of both men was a step in the right direction, we call on the leaders to translate promises into concrete action.
 Representing the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, Hu took a fateful step in announcing China would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. Several of the measures that Hu unveiled will have a dramatic impact, such as making 15 percent of China’s fuel come from non-fossil sources by that target date, while planting enough trees to cover what the Los Angeles Times calculated to be the entire size of Norway. 
UN climate chief Yvo de Boer reacted to Hu’s speech by saying that China could become the “front-runner” on climate change with these steps, depending on the U.S. government’s response. But this lofty aspiration depends on China reaching these targets and proving it has substance to match appealing words. 
For its part, the U.S. does face an important challenge as well. The substance of Obama’s speech was positive and indicated that he recognizes the importance of climate-change efforts, though he could not provide much substance. While the Waxman-Markey bill would make the U.S. the clear leader in climate-change reform, the bill remains stalled in the Senate after passing through the House. While we do not agree with the Los Angeles Times that this situation renders Obama’s words meaningless and the U.S. position “woefully weak,” we do recognize the importance of passing this legislation promptly. 
The IPCC meeting in Copenhagen to replace the ineffective 1997 Kyoto Protocol will be critical for the world’s future, and the U.S. must show initiative in helping to develop a system of short- and middle-term targets and emission reductions for all nations, including developing nations. In such a system, the massively growing nations of China and India will play a critical role. Just as the United States doomed the Kyoto Protocol by rejecting it, the non-participation of any nation in the upcoming Copenhagen talks will sap it of its significance. 
We recognize that developed nations will have to play a larger role in any plan, aiding countries with greater need through shared green technology and general support. We call on Obama and Hu to take leading roles in making such plans a reality. Speeches and declarations of intent are important, but now must come the transition to action.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I am not the first president to take up this cause, but I am determined to be the last.” President Barack Obama retook control of the drawn-out national debate on health-care reform with his recent address to Congress. Some amalgamation of the five bills currently before Congress will probably become law this year. 
This final bill will have three major objectives: providing near-universal coverage, improving the quality of health-insurance policies, and controlling the cost of health care (often wonkishly referred to as “bending the cost curve”). Although the legislation is likely to accomplish the first two goals, stemming health-care inflation will prove more elusive. 
ESPN anchor Dan Patrick’s catchphrase, “You can’t stop ’em, you can only hope to contain ’em,” could easily describe health-care costs. This year, national health spending will account for over 17 percent of GDP, outpacing all other countries. It has grown twice as fast as GDP since 1975 and shows no signs of letting up. Reversing this unsustainable trend is critical to any health-care plan, since maintaining universal coverage and insurance reform requires lowering costs in the long run. 
Congress has offered worthwhile, partial solutions. Universal coverage will allow everyone to visit a doctor before minor health issues turn into expensive, life-threatening ones. A proposed insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses will promote greater competition between insurers, making coverage cheaper. Cutting Medicare reimbursement rates will encourage greater efficiency from doctors and hospitals. These provisions will achieve real cost savings from day one. 
But other policy measures that offer larger savings exist, such as a robust public option, medical malpractice reform, and direct negotiations with pharmaceutical companies on drug prices. Aside from the public option, these potential “game-changers” have received inadequate consideration from Congress. 
Significant debate has emerged on the merits of a public option—a government-run, non-profit, health-insurance plan that would compete with private insurers. Although conservatives have derided the public option as an unnecessary expansion of government, there is a strong economic rationale for including it in the bill. In 34 states, five companies or fewer control the market for insurance available to small groups. These insurers’ dominant market shares make it difficult for new, private competitors to emerge, which keeps insurance costs high.  
A public option stimulates competition by bargaining down prices, forcing private insurers to follow suit for fear of losing business. This should result in lower insurance costs for policyholders. Unfortunately, key congressional Democrats are backtracking on the public option; proposed alternatives, such as member-owned health-care cooperatives, will lack the market share necessary to challenge private insurers. 
President Obama, in a sop to Republicans, spoke favorably of medical malpractice reform in last week’s speech. But his proposed action on this front (the creation of a committee to make recommendations to Congress) is a cop-out. This is not surprising, given trial lawyers’ support for the Democratic Party. Malpractice lawsuits, while a necessary recourse for victims of medical errors, impose a cost on health-care providers. Fearing lawsuits, doctors buy expensive malpractice insurance and order unnecessary tests. Juries, lacking medical expertise, are generally poor assessors of guilt: A study in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates that almost 25 percent of cases in which there was no identifiable medical error resulted in damages. Doctors pass on these costs to patients.  
Instead, special health courts with expert judges should hear medical malpractice cases, a model similar to tax or bankruptcy courts. This would preserve plaintiffs’ legal right to sue while limiting unwarranted damages, reducing the cost of medical care. In a recent New York Times op-ed, former Senator Bill Bradley proposed a bipartisan compromise in which Republicans accept a public option in return for tort reform. Although political considerations probably make such a deal impossible, Congress should reconsider Bradley’s proposal. 
In June, the pharmaceutical industry promised to reduce Medicare prescription drug costs by $80 billion over 10 years.  While a step in the right direction, this concession requires the Obama administration to oppose future cuts in drug costs. A Republican Congress forbade Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices with producers; predictably, costs remain high. Freeing Medicare to bargain with Big Pharma would save the government an estimated $90 billion annually. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs pays lower drug costs than Medicare because it is allowed to negotiate drug prices—it defies logic that one government agency can negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry while another cannot. 
While far from perfect, the health-care plan outlined by President Obama deserves to become law. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that Congress has given short shrift to the solutions outlined here. Since these proposals offer major potential cost savings, lawmakers of both parties should willingly reconsider them—despite the fact that these ideas generate most of their support from one side of the aisle. To paraphrase Deng Xiaopeng, “Whether a pill is black or white makes no difference. As long as it works, it is a good pill.”

Warning: The Career Fair is not an actual fair. Fairs have ponies and candy and fun houses with mirrors that make you look thin (even though you’re fat). Fairs have 300 lb. carnies named “Brick” whose tattoos impressively depict the female anatomy. The Career Fair has none of these.  The Career Fair made me cry, and not with tears of joy. The Career Fair’s Candy is just the name of a mid-level analyst with thoughts on synergy. No livestock; just low-valued stock. No horse shit, well, no real horse shit. Some suits, some sadness, and more ass kissing than a donkey show. And worst of all, the Career Fair means I’m an adult.  It’s Tuesday afternoon at the Fair when I realize this. I’m devastated. How devastated? Well, I’m exaggerating slightly, but think of it as the Holocaust times a million. Here are my classmates toting monogrammed clipboards, and I (and this is the truth) am still not entirely sure what a monogram is. How could I have prepared for this so poorly?  A week previous, like a penitent sinner, I’d made the pilgrimage to OCS for some pamphlet perusing and resume boosting. Side note: this is a thought that’s gone through OCS’s head thousands of times, “Shit, we don’t have enough pamphlets!”   Another side note: browsing the pamphlets at OCS is a bit like seeing the results of full spectrum STD workup on my classmates: penetrating, gross, and not surprising. “How To Get A Recommendation When No One Likes You,” “Is Tons of Name-dropping Enough Name-dropping?” “Fathers, Mothers, Aunts, Uncles, Wives: Meal Tickets!”   While all seemed vaguely helpful, I needed something specifically tailored to the irresponsible way I’d prepared for the professional world, such as “Last Minute Resumes: How to Succeed on Paper Without Really Trying”. Inside I found a few strategies to boost my resume before the old Career Fair.  Fall Back On High School Accomplishments ‘Cause let’s face it, you were actually great back then. Captain of the football team, Emperor of the Chess Club, Evil Emperor of the Resistance Chess Club. Titles were easier to come by than awkward boners. The challenge isn’t remembering how great you were, it’s finding a font small enough to fit that on two lines. Lie Strategically It’s okay to lie on a resume, as long as no one can trace it. The following are prime examples: Worked at Top Secret Spy Company that can’t be discussed or Googled. Won all awards possible but modesty prevents me from listing them. Did anything in Africa.  Having thus prepared my resume, I considered my work done. Fast forward a week to the Career Fair. Folder in hand. Pen on Folder. Nervous bite marks on pen. Small pieces of food on bite marks.  I approach my first recruiter. He’s a man. I record my thoughts. Minute 1: Breath shortens. Self doubt cripples left side of body. Self loathing cripples right side.  Minute 2: Fear of failure empowers both sides. Minute 3: Exhausted. Break for water. Minute 4: Free pens! Minute 5: Limit four per person.  Five brochures, forty pens and a dozen offended recruiters later, I refocus my search on jobs that match the skills this college has given me. Speaking Middle English. Hmm…must have missed all those presentaciouns. Superficially understanding philosophy…darn, if only Harvard were hiring.   I finish cursing Gordon Teskey, whose captivating whimsy sold me on such a useless major. I tuck my pens in my pants, and prepare to return home empty handed.  That’s when I see the dolls, and with them, my holy grail: The Walt Disney Company. Good Ol’ Wally D has brought along stuffed Mickey Mouse Dolls. Dolls are like prizes. Prizes things at real fair. Real Fair Fun. Brain. Not. Computing. Want. To. Explode.  So I do the unthinkable. With the genuine intention of learning about a job, I ask a question. “Dolls” I say. “Not a question” says the doll man. “Strategy or finance?” he asks. “Dolls” I say, pens spilling from my pants. He talks. I nod. And believe it or not, I actually get a business card. Sure, it’s not an offer, but I also stole one of the Mickey Dolls. OK, Career Fair, I’ll call this one a draw.   —Nelson T. Greaves ’10 is a senior in Winthrop House.

If you’ve been saving up your Herrell’s dollars, now is the time to spend them. After a 27-year tenure on Dunster Street, Herrell’s Ice Cream will be closing its Harvard Square franchise as soon as November. The move was forced by rising rents, high product costs, and increased competition. 
Nevertheless, the team behind our local outpost of Herrell’s wants to reassure the community that they are here to stay. “This is a metamorphosis,” said Jeffrey Stannett, president of Leamil Corporation, which owns the franchise. Taking Herrell’s place is First Printer Restaurant Bar and Grill, which will be led by Stannett and the same management that currently operates the store. 
“I’m very sad,” said Judith U. Herrell, President of Herrell’s Development Corporation, of Stannett’s decision to leave the company. “There is no bad blood between us, and I wish them the best.” She added that Herrell’s plans to return to Harvard Square at an as yet undetermined time in the future. 
“Ice cream is a sacred institution in Harvard Square,” said Nick H. Batzell, assistant manager at Herrell’s and long-time customer since childhood. It is “the loyalty” that Batzell will miss most, noting that especially during reunion weekends, Harvard alumni often reminisce to staff about their Herrell’s memories. 
Current Harvard students may also find the news difficult to swallow. “I’m devastated,” said Hunter M. Richard ’12, who said he frequents Herrell’s every Sunday. “It felt like a local place with a nice, home-grown spirit.” 
In addition to the homey atmosphere, the homemade ice-cream has also attracted loyal devotees. “The ice cream at Herrell’s is better than anywhere else in the Square,” said Janelle S. Lambert ’12. 
But the Herrell’s clientele extends far beyond the Harvard community. “It’s ridiculous,” said one patron who is known to staff as “Karen the Milkshake Lady” and has been coming to Herrell’s everyday since 1985. “This is a Harvard Square icon.” 
Despite Herrell’s loyal following, it received a debilitating blow when a new competitor arrived on Massachusetts Avenue in 2007. “We lost about 25% of our business to J.P. Licks,” said Stannett. “Also, our business model in this high rent environment is not viable.” 
Nonetheless, Stannett and his team intend on bouncing back bigger and better. “The articles you’ve read in the papers are inaccurate—this isn’t the end,” said Batzell. “We’re changing, we’re developing into something new.”

Showing up to a party and seeing three other girls wearing the same backless jersey dress from Urban Outfitters can really crimp your style and ruin an otherwise excellent night. Those hoping to avoid a twin fiasco at the next House formal now have a new option just down Mass. Ave.—Vintage Revenge. “Our society is very disposable, and vintage is not,” said owner Denise Goldhagen, who opened her shop in mid-August after closing her previous vintage store in Montana. “It’s all been brought back because it’s so classic and gorgeous.”
After moving to Boston in June, Goldhagen originally wanted to set up shop on Newbury Street, but found that the environment clashed with her vision of a subtle, modest refinement. “It was just all so snobby,” she said. “Every store has the word vintage in it. There’s no character to anything.” Instead, she found atmosphere around Harvard more appropriate for Vintage Revenge. “There’s a lot of energy and a lot of people milling around,” she said.
With chiffon-decked mannequins in the front window, shoppers get a bold first glance before strolling in to check out the clothes, jewelry, and accessories inside, dating from the nineteenth century to the ‘80s. Among the racks packed with tweed jackets, three-piece suits, and poodle skirts, customers can also peruse high-end items, such as luxurious furs, Gucci shoes, and Dior handbags.
“There was so much to look at, I felt like I was poking around in an old trunk,” said Kimberly B. Harshbarger ’10. Harshbarger, along with roommate Sara C. Gallant ’10, immediately thought of Vintage Revenge on the hunt for their outfits for a ‘70s-themed show.
In addition to dry-cleaning all her products before putting them on sale, Goldhagen only carries original pieces, such as costume jewelry from the 1920s. “This is not just junk from Taiwan that breaks instantly,” Goldhagen asserted.
As the sole person running the store seven days a week, Goldhagen also promises one thing to all her customers: leave looking fabulous. “I do not want someone leaving this store looking bad, because one dress can destroy my income,” she said. “It’s not just customer service. It’s called caring.” Call it what you want, we just want to look good.

Although today Harvard Square looks like an outdoor version of a Jersey mall (just replace the mafia housewives with a horde of slow-walking tourists), it wasn’t always this way—and most Cantabrigians don’t need a book to tell them that. But the arrival of “Harvard Square: An Illustrated History Since 1950”, by Mo Lotman, has afforded long-term residents a unique opportunity to revisit—and scrutinize—the gentrification they’ve experienced over their lifetimes.“I was definitely shooting for an immersive feel,” said Lotman. Appropriately, the book is large in size, filled primarily with photos and a colorful arrangement of descriptive text. It is divided into separate sections, one for each decade ranging from the 1950s to the 1990s and beyond.Craig A. Lambert ’69, who is reviewing the book for Harvard Magazine, said he was impressed by the “prodigious amount of research” that went into producing the elaborate volume.  “It’s a wonderful book; he’s gotten just about everything in there for the history of Harvard Square.”Those who have witnessed the changes to the Square said they have noticed an obvious trend. “I think it’s gone from being a little grungier and funkier to being a little more upscale,” said Lotman.Likewise, Robert S. Manning, a Boston resident for the past ten years, says he felt “a little bit of nostalgia for the quirkiness, uniqueness, idiosyncratic-ness of Harvard Square,” while perusing the book in the Coop earlier this week.“I was interested to see how all the independent places are gone, and how it’s become more homogenized and generic,” he said. “Now it’s like going anywhere else in the country.” Like New Jersey?Lambert referred to the current state of the Square as an “academic theme park,” catering primarily to Cambridge’s heavy tourist industry rather than serving the needs of the Harvard community.Despite their opinions about the state of the Square today, both Lambert and Manning said that the book brought back fond memories of the older days in Harvard Square. That would likely please Lotman: “I guess it’s more of a celebration of Harvard Square than anything else, and that’s what I intended it to be,” he said.

Going to Harvard GamesAre you ready for some football?! On Friday, the Harvard football team hosts Brown at 7:00 PM in Harvard Stadium for the Crimson’s home opener. To make this a night to remember, even for those of you who would rather do a p-set on a Friday night than go to a football game, FM has compiled a step-by-step guide to Harvard football’s only night game of the year.Pre-PregameThe first question is what to wear to the game, and there are a few key factors to consider. The first factor is the damned Cambridge weather. Chances are very good that the game will be wicked cold; whatever your widget tells you the temperature will be, dress for ten degrees colder. You will be remaining relatively still for a few hours, and the concrete stands that your posterior will be resting on during the game start to feel quite icy. The key is dressing in layers, making sure your cranium is covered, and wearing a good pair of gloves. The second thing to keep in mind is that you must have some type of Harvard apparel showing. A Lowell t-shirt underneath a sweatshirt and a winter coat does not count. Get a Harvard beanie or scarf, or wear a Harvard t-shirt or jersey over your jackets. The last thing to consider is if your ensemble matches. You are going to a football game, not a club, damnit. As long as you have some crimson showing and you are prepared for the elements, then you are good to go. For those of you who are either a) insane fans, b) plan on getting extremely hammered, or c) Russian—and therefore think New England winter weather is weak—you are encouraged to paint your chest along with six other insane, drunk, and/or Russian friends to spell out “Harvard.” Remember to use all caps, stand in the right order, and not be fat (nobody wants to see that). You may want to have a UHS appointment scheduled ahead of time for the monster of a cold that will be kicking your ass for the next week.PregameEver wonder what the “game”  in pregame originally refers to? Instead of a sketchy party at the Delphic, the true “game” is a rowdy football contest. The goal of the pregame, however, remains the same: getting that good buzz going. Skip the girly drinks on game day, and get some Captain in your veins to enhance your performance as a fan. Beer, shots, Jack and Coke, or even Grandpa’s old cough syrup will also allow you to yell for far longer and come up with much cleverer insults for the opposing team (or so you will think), spurring the Harvard troops to victory. And as it does with homework or talking to HUPD, alcohol just makes the games more fun. A dilemma is presented by the question of where this pregame should take place. Traditional pregame activities such as grilling absurd quantities of meat, throwing a football, or playing cornhole (a game similar in concept to horseshoes but played instead with bean bags and two large target boxes with holes. I am not making this up.) are outdoor events that make up what is better known as a tailgate. For Harvard games though, due to a combination of cold weather and student lameness, the only real tailgating activities that occur outside the stadium will be run by crusty alumni and friends. It may be worth trying to mooch some nice booze and grub off of these reminiscing middle-aged men, but your best bet is probably hosting or attending a pregame in someone’s suite on campus. This is especially the case since all but this Friday’s game begin at around noon, and waking up early to go setup a tailgate just goes against everything Harvard students believe in. This Friday’s game and The Game are the two exceptions: the tailgates before these games will be much more fun and definitely worth checking out.The GameDon’t worry about arriving early to find a seat; you will not have any trouble. Make sure you sit on the side of the stadium with all of the Harvard students, for team unity and also because a lot of the Brown kids probably haven’t showered in a while—just doing their part for the environment. When you find your seats, look around you to establish who you will be high-fiving/chest bumping/excitedly tackling when something good happens. It’s crucial to plan ahead. During a football game, there are certain points where you need to be yelling at the top of your lungs, jumping around, and generally losing your damn mind. These times include the following: on any kickoffs, whenever it is third down for the other team, if we (there is no “Harvard” when you are at the game. You are now part of the team) intercept a pass or recover a fumble, when we score a touchdown, when we make a big play that will secure victory, or when somebody gets the crap knocked out of them. If none of that makes sense to you, don’t worry, the basic rule is if the people around you are going nuts, you should be too. If the referees throw any flags, then you need to yell whatever obscenities you can think of, regardless of whether or not it was a penalty (or even if you have no idea what they called). If the other team happens to score, then it is your duty as a Harvard fan to yell obscenities at the referees for not calling a penalty. If you just get bored, then you should probably yell at the refs.PostgameAfter the game, find your way back across the river, thaw out, and either drink to celebrate the win or drink to mourn the loss (either way, you will also be drinking to celebrate the invention of the heater). Be sure to relive any exciting, embarrassing, or hilarious moments that occurred either on the field or in the stands. Tune the TV to some of the other college football games going on, and take notes from the state school crazies in order to improve your performance for next week.

When I applied to Harvard, my application must have been compelling, considering I got in. The only problem was, it was far from complete. I failed to mention something about myself that is a big part of my life: I really, really like cars.Maybe it’s best I didn’t mention that. Being a car enthusiast at Harvard is an alienating experience, and certainly isn’t satisfied by the physical and social environment.  I’ve spent more of my undergraduate career than is healthy scheming about how to get my car up here and how to keep it up here. I’ve spent much of the rest of the time suppressing the urge to bore my friends with long soliloquies on why turbocharging a daily driver is a bad idea from a reliability standpoint, or why power-to-weight ratio is way more important than raw horsepower, or why…sorry, am I boring you? I’ll stop now. My obsession started early. I subscribed to Car and Driver in fourth grade. I was crushed when my mom made it clear to me that I wouldn’t be getting my license at 16 and three months like the law allowed. More recently, I have swapped a new engine into my 1992 Infiniti G20 two times—once because the old one was dead, the second time because although the first one was doing fine, I wanted more power. I do all the repairs and maintenance not only on my car, but also on my parents’. When I was on leave and working in Utah, I would occasionally take off from work early and go for hours-long drives in the mountains. And I religiously keep up to date on new developments in the automobile industry, so much so that one of my blockmates nicknamed me “Autoblog” after I told her once that I needed to finish reading the car news blog of the same name before we went to Annenberg for dinner. By and large, though, I’ve had to keep my interest closeted at Harvard, despite it being a big part of my life. Very few people here know much about cars, and very few care, either. Why learn about the merits of multilink suspensions when you can learn about an exciting topic in psychology, economics, biology, philosophy, or Folklore and Mythology?  Every once in a while, I slip a reference to my hobby into a conversation to see if anyone will bite, but people rarely do. It’s always refreshing when somebody does, though. My most reliable outlet for car talk until the beginning of this year was, amazingly enough, my House master, Jim McCarthy, who is as much of a gearhead as I am. The Christakises replaced the McCarthys this year, though, and though they’ve been great House masters, I’m going to miss the discussions over dinner of the latest modifications we’ve done on our cars. Added to the alienation of having nobody to talk to about my passion are the trials and tribulations of trying to have a car while at Harvard. On-street parking generally requires a resident parking permit, which would require me to register and insure my car in Massachusetts, at a possible cost of over a thousand dollars a year. Flout the rules and you’ll have to pay hefty fines and might even get your car towed. Off-street parking is available, but most of the time it’s expensive—at least $150 per month. Park in Harvard spots and you risk a ticket.  I gave it up as a lost cause for freshman year and much of sophomore year, but gradually, I learned ways to get around these obstacles. On-street and Harvard parking is unenforced in some places after hours and on weekends. There are a few streets, including one near the Quad, that do not require that you have a permit to park there. I carefully researched the options and requirements, and drove my car up from Maryland after spring break last year. I’ve had it here ever since, and have only gotten two parking tickets. It’s basically impossible to drive to class (do you see any parking spaces in Harvard Yard?), but I enjoy the occasional late-night drive, use it to run errands, and drive in to the Square on weekends for extracurriculars, just because I can. In the end, being a car enthusiast at Harvard hasn’t been a total loss. If anything, the dearth of fellow enthusiasts just makes it that much more exciting when I find one. And I’ve managed to work my interest into my academic work: my thesis is a creative photography project documenting different types of car repair. I can even occasionally amuse my friends with my running commentary during car-themed movies; if you’ve decided to watch “The Fast and The Furious” and I walk in, be prepared to learn that “granny-shifting, not double-clutching like you should” doesn’t actually mean anything on modern cars. Who knew? Maybe including my love of cars on my admissions application might have been an asset rather than a liability after all?—David I. Fulton-Howard ’08-10 is a senior Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator in Pforzheimer House. He goes coo coo for Corollas.

“Harvard senior, just back from the bars.... looking for something now and on campus” reads one post under the “men seeking men” section of personals on craigslist.org. Another post is a bit less explicit: “Hey, im 20, a student at Harvard… i hate using craigslist and im pretty skeptical about it however hopfully ill be able to meet some chill guys from the area for whatever really. we can grab coffee and see where things go.”For many students at Harvard, online dating is a prominent (albeit, not often talked about) part of their social lives. JDate.com, eHarmony, match.com, and craiglist all have their share of Harvard posts. Yet among Harvard undergraduates, it seems as though the gay community feels less of a stigma attached to online dating. “Especially with craiglist, gay men are the people who use it the most. If you look at the ads for men seeking women, or women seeking men, or women seeking women there are fewer of them,” says Brandon J. Ortiz ’12, who has used the site in the past.  “Informally, anecdotally, I do notice that there tends to be more open conversation about it amongst my gay friends than amongst my straight friends,” says Marco Chan ’11, Co-Chair of Harvard College Queer Students and Allies. While he is less certain that online dating is truly more prevalent in Harvard’s gay community, he does suggest a possible reason.“To some extent, being queer makes you more keenly aware of the fact that the dating pool statistically, numerically, will be smaller than the general population,” says Chan. “In Harvard, like any other community, there are people with very diverse interests and very diverse needs.”Rafael T. Quintanar ’10 met his boyfriend of nearly a year and half, who attends Tufts, through OKCupid.com, an online dating site. “It’s the only way that I would have met him and I’m really glad that I did it,” he says.Quintanar’s use of online dating sites began when he was in high school. “There weren’t really any other gay guys at my high school. The Internet was an easy option,” says Quintanar. “Then I just continued staying on it because I had experiences of meeting new friends.”But be wary of a craiglist user like “hot, horny, close to Harvard Sq.” He might have something more than friendship on his agenda.

A new era has dawned in Leverett House dining hall. A screen now covers the infamous multicolored mural on the House’s pristine walls. Its presence is ominous, hinting at the mural’s upcoming removal. The old painting will soon be replaced with a sweeping landscape of the Charles River and Weeks footbridge, an acrylic painting drawn by Leverett’s own Julia E. Rozier ’08. While Rozier’s painting is welcomed by all, this welcome is, of course, preceded by fond reminiscing about the old, less aesthetically pleasing mural.  “It looked like part of the opening sequence of a 1980’s sitcom,” James P. Alexander ’10 said. Ritchell R. van Dams ’11, sitting next to Alexander at one of Lev’s rectangular tables, agreed.  “Like something Will Smith was wearing,” Ritchell said. Although Amy Elizabeth Smekar ’11 noted,  “It was nice for Lev to collectively hate on something,” Rozier’s painting, which was greeted with a standing ovation at its September 2 unveiling, provides a centerpiece for Leverett to collectively enjoy.  “The new mural is gorgeous. I’m really excited,” said Kaitlyn E. Coil ’10. The incoming painting, created over the summer, is drawn from a photograph Rozier took of the Charles, exactly from the angle that Leverett looks onto the river. This picture was the last one that she managed to snap before her camera memory ran out.  The lucky image will open up the room to the outside world, especially during the chilly winter months, said Rozier, “It brings a big splash of summer sunshine into the dining hall—what better to remind you of things to come?”  Complete with a rabbit perched in its bottom left hand corner (Freshmen note: the rabbit is Lev’s mascot), the painting is emblematic of the spirit of Leverett House—filled with color that doesn’t clash, and eliciting comfort rather than confusion. “I think the painting is definitely the topic of many conversations in the dining hall. I think the nature of those conversations is going to change,” Resident Dean Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said. Is this new mural change we can believe in? Lev we can.

Light blue shorts-jumpsuit? Check. Pleather lined clear visor? Check. Bright green plaid skirt? Check. Halloween is a month and a half away, but I’ll be wearing this stuff to class on Monday. I can see you silently judging me as I walk—strut—through Lamont cafe, but I know I’m not the only one. Party costumes work their way into the front of your closet, and before you know it you’re wearing a koala head hat just because it’s cold outside.
The costume as clothing isn’t just a great idea for a special exhibition at The Met (I hope you’re reading this, Anna), is also the hottest trend for this year. As determined by me. Because I can’t be the only one on this campus dressing like Heidi Klum just told me “auf Wiedersehen.” On your next trip to Oona’s—mine are weekly—think about your future party pics in a boring lecture hall, not a sweaty dining hall.
A fair warning: not all parties lend themselves to daily wardrobe. No one in your English class signed up for Leather and Lace and Literature. And art history would probably be more interesting in a toga, but unless you look like David under that sheet, don’t try to pull it off. And I’m talking Michelangelo’s David, not Donatello’s. Apart from these guidelines, your closet is like Moral Reasoning 54—all is permitted.
This is not, however, an endorsement of the opposite trend: wearing normal clothing to costume parties. If you can go to a Goldman interview in the same outfit you wear to a costume party, then you should know that you are a buzzkill and nobody likes you.
I could tell you a story about the kid who did dress up for Heaven and Hell and then went to a Goldman interview in the same outfit. He doesn’t work at Goldman, but it’s a really funny story though.

Prominent social entrepreneur and former Institute of Politics fellow Alan A. Khazei ’83 will announce his candidacy for the Senate at a rally on Boston Common tomorrow, entering a contentious race for the seat formerly held by the late Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56. Khazei will vie against Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, State Congressman Michael E. Capuano, and Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen G. Pagliuca for the Democratic nomination in the January 19 special election. Both Khazei and Pagliuca also hold graduate degrees from Harvard.Khazei is a member of the Harvard Law School class of 1987 and Pagliuca is a 1982 graduate of Harvard Business School. Khazei, a longtime advocate for public service, said he will use the rally as a chance to lay out his vision of governance, which involves promoting citizen initiative, creating public-private partnerships, and increasing government efficiency.“Even after the election of Barack Obama, Congress fell back into the old debate of ‘We need to bring back FDR’ versus ‘We need to bring back Ronald Reagan,’” Khazei said in an interview. “I think both are wrong. It’s the 21st century now­—we need a new approach. We need big citizenship instead of big government.”Khazei added that he decided to run after spending his entire life in the nonprofit sector. He launched his public service career in 1987 when he co-founded City Year, a program designed to place 17- to 24-year-olds in yearlong service projects.The program quickly flourished, and President Bill Clinton used it as a model when he created AmeriCorps, a national service organization, in 1993.City Year also brought Khazei together with Senator Kennedy, who was a longtime advocate for the program and who served as its first-ever corps graduation speaker. Khazei called the Senator “an extraordinary mentor and a great friend,” and said it was Kennedy’s example that first made him consider entering politics. Nafees A. Syed ’10, who served as one of Khazei’s liaisons during his fellowship, said she was happy to learn that he would be seeking the Senate seat.“During his time here, he showed himself to be a really honest, caring person—not just on a personal level, but also in his aspirations for what America should be,” Syed said. Harvard supporter Sam B. Novey ’11 said he decided to work on the Khazei campaign because he was inspired by Khazei’s lifelong work. More than thirty other Harvard students have publicly declared support for Khazei, according to Novey.“We’re out there getting signatures, recruiting volunteers, and getting people to help out in their communities,” Novey said. —Staff writer Evan T.

Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, seeking a record fifth consecutive mayoral term, commandingly won a high-turnout preliminary contest last night and will now face City Councilor Michael F. Flaherty Jr. in November’s final election.“I spoke of a new Boston miracle for our youth, new urban mechanics for our city, green jobs, and more affordable housing,” Menino said to supporters as voting results poured in. “Tonight, we stand one step closer to that vision.”Last night’s preliminary election narrowed the mayoral field from four candidates to two. Menino, referred to by some as “Mumbles” for his thick Boston accent and history of verbal gaffes, swept roughly half the vote. Flaherty came in second place with about a quarter, and City Councilor Sam Yoon, Boston’s first Asian-American elected official and the only Asian-American ever to run for public office in the City, finished third with approximately 20 percent of the vote. Real estate developer Kevin McCrea finished last. Turnout in the race far exceeded the expectations of most experts, with almost 82,000 out of 350,000 eligible voters hitting the polls. In 2005, a total of 41,000 people voted in the preliminary election. “It’s very good for democracy to have a contested mayoral contest,” said former City Councilor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, who continues to follow Boston politics closely. “Because we’ve had arguably two viable candidates and one gadfly [in addition to Menino], people have focused on this race over the summer. It’s the first time that’s happened since 1993.” Menino, who is sometimes jokingly referred to as “mayor for life,” came to power in 1993 and has since either run unopposed or dominated elections with a large majority of votes. He has maintained approval ratings in the low 70s over the past few years despite the economic slump and criticism of Boston’s public school system, according to surveys by the Boston Globe. A poll from May found that 57 percent of Boston residents claimed to have met the Mayor personally.Despite his seemingly invulnerable political position, the 66-year-old Menino found himself challenged this year by three much younger candidates, all of whom promised to bring change and transparency to Boston. But Menino has thus far overwhelmed opponents using his superior campaign manpower and war chest. According to the Globe, Menino’s campaign had $939,000 to spend as of a week ago, compared to Flaherty’s $216,000.“Flaherty will need to work very quickly to consolidate support among people who voted for Yoon, and to a lesser extent, McCrea,” DiCara said, adding that Flaherty and the Mayor are “culturally very similar” and may appeal to the same voters. DiCara noted that running against an incumbent in Boston is extremely difficult in any scenario, and said that the last time a Boston mayoral incumbent lost was in 1949.Despite the uphill battle ahead, Flaherty called for “courage” from supporters at a victory party last night.“The journey has just begun,” Flaherty said. “Tomorrow in Boston will be a new day.”—Staff writer Peter F.

Among the stately high ceilings and rare books collections of Houghton Library’s Edison-Newman Room, acclaimed poet Simon Armitage read select poems evoking images of his native English landscape before a packed audience last night.Speaking some lines with slow, measured syllables and others with rapid, beat-like inflections, Armitage led his audience to laugh at his unexpected images, tap their fingers to the beat of his words, and lean forward to catch his every fading syllable. “Simon’s poetry behaves characteristically in a very recognizable geography of everyday life,” English Professor W. James Simpson said in introduction. “But they also have the capacity to invest that ordinary experience with mystery, surprise and revelation.”Armitage read original poems and translations published throughout the span of his career.“You’re beautiful because you’re classically trained. / I’m ugly because I associate piano wire with strangulation,” began one of Armitage’s poems that drew laughter from the listeners. Another poem, titled “The Shout,” contained the lines “We were testing the range / of the human voice.”  Armitage said that the poem, which recounted a childhood memory in northern England, “has become something of a signature tune.”“I think it just helps to locate me a little bit, where I’m from, the subjects I write about,” he said of the poem.Many other poems Armitage chose to read last night drew on his childhood home in northern England. He said that he can see the area manifest itself through his work.“I respect and acknowledge the area there, and I can see it now...through the poems,” Armitage said. “Occasionally, people will describe me as a Northern writer. But if it describes what the poem is about, then I take it as a compliment.”Rachael L. Goldberg ’12 said that Armitage’s reading exposed her to a new experience, “Reading his poems and hearing him read them were two very different experiences,” she said. “Simon Armitage was amazing, brilliant, and hilarious.”Armitage is the vice president of the Poetry Society and a senior lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, He has been described by Harvard English Professor and leading American poetry critic Helen Vendler as “a narrative poet in lyric dress, or a lyric poet in narrative dress.”The event was sponsored by the Harvard English Department.—Staff writer Manning Ding can be reached at ding3@fas.harvard.edu.

Newly elected Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent, Jeffrey M. Young, unveiled a proposed timeline for remedying the “middle school issue” at last night’s school committee meeting—a move aimed at finalizing a set of concrete action plans for the initiative by April 2010.After a five-month process of collecting data and engaging members of the community, Young plans to present the committee with a set of recommendations at a meeting in February. For decades, the committee has expressed a concern about the quality of education 6th-8th grade students receive in the city’s K-8 schools. Critics say that the system, which lacks a traditional 6-8 “middle school” environment, does not meet the needs of students in early adolescence.In 2007, the committee formed the Blue Ribbon Commission on Middle School Education and the next year,  they released a report outlining the challenges facing the district’s 11 primary schools.When Young was elected, he agreed to provide concrete recommendations regarding “the middle school issue” within the first a hundred days of his tenure. But earlier this month, Young announced his decision to delay the deadline.  The committee, which adopted the new proposed timeline, will now spend 11 meetings over the next six months reviewing the issue.The shift in the timeline also means that the final vote will occur in April 2010, after a new school committee is elected in Nov. 2009.While school committee members thought that the new deadline was an appropriate move for a new superintendent who may need time to familiarize himself with the situation, several cautioned against further delaying action on the issue.School Committee member Luc D. Schuster, who has announced that he will not be running for reelection in November, said that he was “very concerned” about the school committee’s “continued inclination to postpone this decision.”“This was a big issue when I campaigned in 2005 and it was a major issue when I campaigned in 2007,” he said. “Now, it’s 2009.” —Staff writer Sofia E.

While revisions to America’s healthcare system are currently being debated on the floor of Congress, four legal experts tackled the issue in a panel discussion at the Law School yesterday.The panel, entitled “When Medical Care Compromises Financial Health: Causes and Possible Solutions,” focused on the under-reported issue of insurance often not protecting against financial troubles brought on by high healthcare costs.“The rising cost of medical care in the United States is driving up premiums, and what’s been going on under premiums is an erosion of benefits,” said panelist Cathy Schoen, senior vice president of The Commonwealth Fund. The panel also included Christopher T. Robertson, a visiting fellow at Harvard Law School, Melissa B. Jacoby, a law professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and Matt Selig, the acting director of the Health Law Advocates.Robertson stressed that many individuals with health insurance still end up in debt due to medical costs.“Approximately two-thirds of people who [experienced] home foreclosure had medical insurance,” he said. Selig discussed the conflict between the interests of the health insurance industry and the financial well-being of the average American. “Healthcare doesn’t follow neat ideologies,” Robertson said, noting that he participated in the panel because he feels that some aspects of the debate are being ignored.Organized by The Petrie-Flom Center at HLS, which is dedicated to interdisciplinary research on health law, bioethics, and biotechnology, the open panel was meant to be accessible to both the Harvard and Cambridge communities.The event was mainly attended by HLS academic fellows and professors employed by the University. Among their slew of proposed reforms, the panelists emphasized increased coverage for more Americans to protect them from bankruptcy via medical expense. The goal, Schoen said, is to avoid a system in which individuals are “offered coverage, but have everything that’s wrong with you excluded [from your plan].”

Novelist Orhan Pamuk, a Nobel laureate, said in a lecture yesterday that he was once a naïve young man who read while lounging beside a stinking ashtray at home in 1970s Istanbul. During his first Norton Lecture, Pamuk said that unlike Harvard students, he taught himself. He plunged into bildungsromans like Gustave Flaubert’s “Sentimental Education,” looking for action and conflict and the meaning of life, “not bothered at all about the artificial act of reading and writing a novel.” Over time, the wisdom in the bildungsroman shaped his soul and he grew reflective and unsettled, as a driver becomes conscious of his machine, he said.Pamuk spoke cheerfully, dressed conservatively in black and white, his enthusiasm and sincerity brimming over his careful enunciation as he painted metaphorical landscapes and read excitedly from his favorite novels.Now, after 35 years of writing novels, Pamuk told an audience in Sanders Theater that “being a novelist is the art of...being both naïve and sentimental.” Pamuk said that he was using the word sentimental in its particular German sense—reflective—which he came to admire by reading Friedrich Schiller’s “On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry,” an inspiration for his current lectures, called “The Naïve and the Sentimental Novelist.” The Charles Eliot Norton Lectures have been a Harvard tradition since 1926, and are now hosted by the Humanities Center. As he delivers the five remaining lectures, Pamuk will spend time on campus, and will even hold office hours, according to Director of the Humanities Center and Professor Homi K. Bhabha. All the lectures are held at 4 p.m. in Sanders Theater, and are free and open to the public. The next lecture will be September 29, and the final lecture will be delivered on November 3.Pamuk won the Nobel Prize in 2006. He has lived for many years in Istanbul, and is now a professor at Columbia University, where he teaches comparative literature and writing. His books have sold over seven million copies, and his statements on politics have generated much controversy, especially in Turkey.In future lectures, Pamuk said he will return to Schiller, as well as examine various aspects of the novel. “Each sentence of a good novel evokes in us a sense of real, great knowledge of what it means to exists in this world,” he said, calling the process a search for a center. “In these talks, we will investigate how a novel can bear all this weight.”­­—Staff writer Alex M.

Harvard signed an agreement with the government of Chile last week that would provide enough financial support to nearly double the number of Chilean students across the University’s graduate schools to a total of 50 students.“When a bright student needs money, he or she should be able to come,” said Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez, who signed the agreement on behalf of the University.The recently negotiated deal marks Harvard’s shifting strategy in securing sources of funding. In recent months, University administrators have taken steps to ensure that terms of such agreements are flexible enough to accommodate its beneficiaries, whose needs will likely change over time.Donations frequently come with strings attached. A fund, for instance, may be specifically intended to endow a professorship in Korean studies. Harvard officials are now reevaluating whether restrictive agreements signed in the past can be renegotiated to match available resources with current needs.“We now have a more systematic process, since there ought to be a mechanism to scrutinize endowments,” Dominguez said of the Gift Policy Committee, which is chaired by University Provost Steven E. Hyman and has now absorbed these responsibilities.These efforts had  been underway before the financial crisis heightened the need to allocate current use of funds efficiently, Dominguez said.Over the last five years, Chile’s economy has been bolstered by a spike in copper prices. As copper accounts for roughly 16.4 percent of the nation’s GDP, according to the Central Bank of Chile, the government was able to accumulate a financial cushion of around $21 billion worth of savings in sovereign wealth funds and a similar amount in central bank reserves, the New York Times reported.Such financial policies allowed Chile to announce a $4 billion stimulus package this January and provide fellowship funding to Chilean students at several foreign universities, including Harvard.The new agreement will provide fellowships for about 30 additional students, as well as funding to support their families. If a student’s spouse is admitted to Harvard, he or she would also receive a fellowship to cover educational expenses.As Harvard students hail from over 120 countries, Dominguez said that the University is redoubling its efforts to obtain necessary funding to support international students. Currently, Harvard has entered into fellowship or scholarship agreements with 18 countries, including Chile.“We want to make it possible for all to attend Harvard schools without financial constraints,” Dominguez said. “Obviously, there is a lot of work ahead.”—Staff writer Athena Y.

New York City Resident Jason Aquino, one of the three men allegedly involved in the fatal Kirkland House shooting this May, will not be charged for murder, prosecutors said yesterday.
Aquino, 23, will now face charges of being an accessory after the fact of armed robbery and carrying a firearm without license. He has been held without bail since his lower court arraignments on August 3. New bail will be set at Aquino’s arraignment today in Middlesex Superior Court.
Corey Welford, a spokesman for the Middlesex district attorney’s office, told the Associated Press that prosecutors dropped the murder charges in part due to “additional developments of the facts and witness statements.” 
Welford declined to disclose any new details about the May 18th shooting, citing the secrecy of the grand jury process.
First-degree charges remain against the two other men, Jabrai Jordan Copney, 20, and Blayn “Bliz” Jiggetts, 19. Copney pleaded not guilty at his arraignment,  and Jiggetts is awaiting extradition from New York. The three men were allegedly involved in what prosecutors called a “drug rip”. Aquino, Copney, and Jiggetts, none of whom were Harvard students, arranged to meet Cosby on May 18 and planned to rob him. 
During the meeting, multiple shots were fired in the basement of Kirkland J entryway. One of the shots struck Cosby and resulted in his death. Investigators later found marijuana and approximately $1,000 near Cosby’s body.
The three men fled the scene and returned to New York City that evening.
Copney was arrested in Harlem on May 21 and later indicted by a Middlesex Superior Court grand jury on charges including murder, accessory after the fact of murder, and possession of a firearm. He is being held without bail.
Jiggetts was arrested on June 9 and was indicted on July 10 by a Middlesex grand jury on similar charges. He has not yet been arraigned in Massachusetts.
Harvard University Police, Cambridge Police, state police, and the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office continue to investigate the murder.

The College administration renewed its commitment yesterday to begin physical renovations in the upperclassman Houses by 2012, despite University-wide budget cutbacks that have recently made the future of the sweeping $1 billion Capital Renewal project uncertain.
Dean of the Office of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said that the University is currently in the “fluid and inexpensive” stage of drafting blueprints for the House renewal project, an undertaking that will require a complete conceptual and structural redesign of Harvard’s decades-old residential House system.
“Last year we were in a place where we were planning and designing,” Nelson said. “We weren’t ready to build. We anticipate actual construction for 2012 and I think we should keep talking about this date.”
In April 2008, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced that the University would embark on the 15-year-long endeavor, which Nelson later characterized as a transformational modernization of residential life. They said it would entail gutting each of the Houses and reconstructing their interiors to take into consideration student needs ranging from increased privacy to the availability of social spaces.
The Report on Harvard House Renewal, a 112-page document of residential recommendations released in April, suggested additions like theatres, gyms, and grilles to foster greater inter-House community.  
In 2008, a presentation by planners from the firm Einhorn Yaffee Prescott Architecture and Engineering suggested that the new buildings could feature state-of-the-art technologies that would make both the neo-Georgian and more modern Houses ecologically efficient with facilities that contribute less to Harvard’s carbon footprint.
But after convening a handful of focus groups and student-faculty committee meetings and conducting student surveys last year, the University has not presented any concrete plans for House renewal beyond the broad recommendations included in April’s report.
With less than three years until the anticipated construction date, Nelson acknowledged that several considerations have yet to be addressed—including the need to identify potential temporary housing for undergraduates displaced by construction.
“We do know that if we take an entire house off, we will have to relocate students,” Nelson said. “We do know that that’s a need, but we don’t know how we’re going to do it.”
The University currently faces an unprecedented 30-percent loss in the value of its endowment. When the renovation plan was first announced in 2008, the endowment was valued at about $37 billion. The endowment is currently valued at $26 billion.

Three Harvard affiliates were named recipients of the 2009 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow yesterday.Professor of Applied Mathematics Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan, Assistant Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences Peter J. Huybers, and Rebecca D. Onie ’98-’97, co-founder and CEO of Project HEALTH will be awarded a $500,000 grant, which can be used for any purpose.“The award is an extraordinary opportunity: it gives us a forum to talk about [public health] at time when the health care debate is really heating up,” said Onie, who founded Project HEALTH with Chief of Pediatrics at Boston Medical Center Barry S. Zuckerman during her sophomore year at Harvard.Onie had worked in the Housing Unit of Greater Boston Legal Services during her freshman year when she met a doctor who talked to her about the link between health and poverty. According to Onie, she realized that families were getting sick because they were forced to purchase prescription medication themselves and could not afford to pay rent.“We’re never going to improve the health of our patients unless we start from the home,” Onie said. At Project HEALTH clinics, which Onie founded, physicians prescribed housing in addition to medication.“We really believe that there are wonderfully creative people in our midst,” said Daniel J. Socolow, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program. “They need time, opportunity, and space to really do their thing, and they know far better than anybody else how to do it.”For Huybers, whose work in climatology earned him the Fellowship, the award is an opportunity to further his research.“I want to better understand how the climate works,” he wrote in an e-mailed statement to The Crimson. “For example, I’ve tried to figure out what caused the alternations between glacial and inter-glacial climates over the past several million years.”Applied Mathematics Professor Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan could not be reached for comment yesterday.According to Socolow, the key word is “creativity,” which the Foundation purposely chooses not to define. He disagrees with the nickname “genius award” because it is far too limiting.“‘Genius’ is not descriptive enough,” Socolow said. “These people are not only wonderfully talented and very bright, but also tenacious, risk-taking, and bold. They are a unique blend and wonderfully creative.”

When she worked in Massachusetts Hall last year, Catherine Gorodentsev found it difficult to walk from her office to the Science Center in under ten minutes. But Gorodentsev—now the acting Dean for Administration in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—welcomed the distractions.“I bump into ten people along the way who will say, ‘Oh, by the way...’” said Gorodentsev in an interview yesterday. “If you’re not walking around, you’re not bumping into people. You’re not hearing the valuable word on the street. You’re not feeling the vibe of the place.”This managerial perspective has proved critical in her transition from the central administration to FAS. With her extensive administrative experience in various hubs throughout Harvard, Gorodentsev said she emphasizes on-the-ground communication to ensure that information not only flows from top administrators to departments, but also the other way around.“Cathy’s advantage is that people trust her implicitly and immediately,” said University Professor Gary King, who heads the Institute for Quantitative Social Science, where Gorodentsev once served as executive director. “That makes it easier for her to figure out what they are about and develop different organizational structures, reporting lines, or communication strategies to solve the problem.”NOT JUST KEEPING THE SEAT WARMPrior to her July appointment as interim dean, Gorodentsev served as chief of staff to former Executive Vice President Edward C. Forst ’82, who left in August. Gorodentsev—who has worked at the University for more than ten years—is “no stranger to Harvard,” as FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement to faculty and staff.“I don’t consider myself an academic,” said Gorodentsev, who has served in administrative posts in the controller’s office and the finance office of Harvard Kennedy School. “I’m a professional administrator.”As interim dean of administration, Gorodentsev has been charged with overseeing FAS units including human resources, information technology, and research administration. She also works with the directors of the FAS finance office and physical resources office.“I came into the role not wanting to keep the seat warm,” Gorodentsev said. “Rather, I pretended that I was the permanent person because I really wanted to get as much done as I could.”According to Gorodentsev, the individual who will take her position on a permanent basis will be named the dean for administration and finance, the post previously held by Brett C. Sweet. Gorodentsev, an avid long-distance runner who wakes up at 5:05 most mornings for her regular runs, believes in taking on the full marathon if she’s even going to try.‘A UTILITY PLAYER’At a recent meeting for department administrators, FAS officials said they were interviewing candidates “who would be committed to Harvard and hopefully wouldn’t leave—you know—so soon” to fill vacant deanships, said Classics Department administrator Teresa Wu.After less than a year on the job, former FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Brett C. Sweet left Harvard for a top post at Vanderbilt University in late July, prompting Smith to start a national search for a replacement. Deena Giancotti, associate dean for finance, has temporarily taken over the finance-related responsibilities that typically fell under Sweet’s purview, according to Gorodentsev.Gorodentsev herself was in a state of transition. With Forst slated to leave for Goldman Sachs, she said she decided against remaining in the role of chief of staff—after all, Forst had selected her for the position, and she wanted the incoming executive vice president to do the same. She said, “I didn’t think it made much sense for me to stick around and wait, and say, ‘Would this work or not?’”Gorodentsev’s vocational limbo came at an opportune moment for Sweet. When Gorodentsev asked the finance guru how she could assist him in light of his impending departure, Sweet’s answer was prompt: “He said, ‘Well, actually, there is something you can do.’” Gorodentsev recalled.Late July, she was appointed acting FAS dean for administration—essentially taking on the more managerial facet of Sweet’s previous post. In addition, Gorodentsev has been entrusted with the responsibilities of Lawrence M. Levine—the associate dean for information technology and chief information officer—until an appointment is made to replace him.The University urgently needed a competent individual to fill the vacancies—and Gorodentsev, with her broad administrative scope and interpersonal strengths, fit the bill, according to King.“She’s a utility player. She can do almost anything you throw at her,” King said. “The number of people who could just jump into a job like that and hit the ground running is really small.”Smith declined to comment on whether Gorodentsev is under consideration for a permanent position as dean of administration and finance or any other post within FAS.“I have no idea whether she’s being considered for other positions, but I certainly hope so,” said Stephen M. Kosslyn, FAS’ dean of social science. “She’s very strategic, very smart, and very practical—and that’s quite a combination.”FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVEThough Gorodentsev said she would love to continue working at Harvard, one of her greatest passions lies beyond the Yard. She previously served as the administrative director for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief at the School of Public Health, a program that delivers antiretroviral treatment to millions of HIV-positive individuals. Though Gorodentsev worked chiefly for Africa in the PEPFAR program, her interests abroad have not been confined to that continent.While working for the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation in the mid-1990s, Gorodentsev—who has a Russian husband and studied Russian—helped privatize small retail stores in Russia and eventually collective and state farms.“We were these 20-something kids running around Russia, hired only because we were relatively bright and fearless and had the Russian skills,” Gorodentsev said.Gorodentsev said she hopes to eventually return to a managerial post that allows her to oversee projects abroad.“I think at the right time at my life—which is code for when my kids go to college—I will go back and do that,” she said.—Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A series of violent crimes in Boston this weekend left two dead—including a pregnant teenager—and seven injured, with four wounded after a fight involving a machete, the Boston Herald reported.However, conversations with a number of students indicate that Harvard undergraduates remain largely unconcerned. most say they remain unaware of the weekend’s burst of violent crime. “I didn’t hear anything,” Matthew C. Plaks ’13 said.One student, Lukas Strnad ’10, was unfazed upon hearing of the incidents because of their distance from campus. “If it were to happen on the street in Cambridge, I would be seriously worried. But unless it happens immediately around Cambridge I won’t get too concerned.” However, another student, Elizabeth H. Thompson ’12, when informed of the incidents, said, “I’ve walked into Boston at night once or twice and I probably wouldn’t do that anymore.” Cambridge Police Department spokesman Frank Pasquarello recommended that students be cautious. “The only advice I can give people is that any time you’re in an area where you believe you’re in danger, always try to walk with someone. Be aware of your surroundings,” he said.A BPD spokesperson said that investigators have strong leads in the murder of the teenager and are looking into a number of possible suspects in the other murder case.The pregnant victim, Paola Castillo, was fatally shot while celebrating her 18th birthday early Sunday morning by an uninvited guest who had recently been ejected from her party.On the same day, a house party in Dorchester ended in chaos when apparently unprovoked gunfire broke out, killing 21-year-old Carl Hentz Belizaire and injuring three guests. The other three victims are expected to recover.Finally, at 5 a.m. Sunday, a brawl involving 15 to 20 individuals took a potentially deadly turn as one man pulled out a machete and left three others hospitalized with stab wounds. All are expected to survive, but their attacker escaped.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend I made a trip that I had been putting off for months. My good friend at UMass Amherst often encourages me to escape the Cambridge bubble and journey across the state to spend a weekend at his frat, but I just as often decline, terrified that a few days away from Harvard spells a death sentence for schoolwork. This time, though, I was out of excuses.
“Just come up on Saturday,” he said. “We’re having a tailgate before our football game and you can head right back. Maybe you can even write a story about it.”
Yeah right. How could I possibly swing a Harvard sports column about my trip to UMass? But I figured it could be fun. I had always wanted to see how a classic frat on a huge campus approached the hallowed tradition of tailgating.
Pulling into the stadium parking lot I was prepared for chaos—a sloppy pregame ritual that would live up to the school’s billing as “ZooMass.” 
Instead, I found tailgating at its finest. It is illegal to have kegs outdoors in the city of Amherst and, while my friend’s fraternity had loaded an SUV to capacity with 30-racks, the event presented little more than the essentials—a group of friends grilling burgers, listening to music, and swapping weekend stories. 
No one was really talking football, since, just like at Harvard, nobody goes to the games.
“The games aren’t that fun, because our team sucks,” one tailgater succinctly explained.
But we don’t have that excuse. Despite a tough loss to Holy Cross in Worcester last weekend, the Crimson is primed for another strong football season. 
And while not everyone is destined to become a Harvard football fan, a pregame ritual done right could offer something to all members of the community, avid supporter and casual observer alike.
The longer I spent with the UMass tailgaters, the more I became convinced that Harvard could replicate this phenomenon. 
Perhaps it was the haze of grill smoke or the buzz of recently ingested burger grease, but I was inspired with the possibility of groups dotting the Soldier Field parking lot before games.
Of course, we have attempted our own tailgates. The H-Club dutifully sponsored a giant event before the home opener against Holy Cross under the lights last year, but the result was far from ideal. 
Entirely overwhelmed and understaffed, the Crimson Crazies never had a chance to accommodate the pregame crowd, and the thought of shoving aside a dozen other people to earn a shot at a burger somehow dulled the luster. 
Although H-Club clearly worked frantically, it could not deliver what a tailgate should be.
Tailgating engenders two fundamental tenets of the American football-watching tradition—laziness and gluttony in the face of athletes who are exhausting themselves to within the last inch of their physical ability. 
So in order for such an event to be successful, it must provide a relaxed atmosphere and abundant food for each person, and neither can be accomplished in a mammoth, school-sponsored setting. Indeed, if we’ve learned one key element of pregame gatherings, it’s that they thrive on intimacy.
The question, then, is how to instill the art of the tailgate within our community.
Unlike UMass, most of our students don’t have cars, and as much as I may profess my love and commitment to the tailgate, the chances of me lugging a full-size grill and mountains of food across the river on Saturday morning are zero (see fundamental tenet #1: laziness).
The solution, though, is simple—our Houses are ideal venues for pregame gatherings.
The house system already provides us with more intimate groupings of students and the relaxed environment of a courtyard barbeque evokes tailgate perfection. 
I would even encourage HoCo’s to move a stein club or two to Saturday morning (or the Friday opener), as the essences of the two events largely overlap. 
While we are beholden to the same city ordinance that prevents Amherst residents from bringing kegs to tailgates, no rule would prevent the houses from indulging those over 21 in a few pregame beers.
Of course, only the river houses are close enough to the stadium to encourage actual game attendance, but we can welcome quad folk with open arms. 
These events wouldn’t need to be exclusive to a house as long as enough of them played host to alleviate pressure on any one dining hall staff or house committee. 
In addition, sponsoring such events would not prove to be a significant burden, as there are only about two weekends a season during which the weather makes an outdoor tailgate palatable.
There you have my plea. Support from the Houses could go a long way in promoting more engagement between the student body and our strong athletics. 
I know it would be much easier to entice me to a tailgate (and eventually to a game) if I could find this rich Saturday tradition after a two-minute walk, rather than a two-hour drive. 
Not everyone needs to become a Crimson Crazy, but we can all appreciate the good food and good community inherent in a well-executed tailgate. HoCo and house masters, this is your chance to call the play.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After scoring 15 goals over its first four games of the season, the Harvard field hockey team was held to just a single shot on goal last night, as it was shut out by the fifth-ranked Huskies from the University of Connecticut.The Crimson (3-2, 0-1 Ivy) got off to a slow start, surrendering five goals in the first half. But Harvard came back stronger in the second half, letting in just a single shot thanks to defensive adjustments and a change in attitude.“[In the second half] we stepped up and played a little looser and were able to go after it better,” said Crimson head coach Sue Caples.The Huskies (8-0, 1-0 Big East) were led by four-time Big East Offensive Player of the Week Loren Sherer, who netted her 12th and 13th goals of the season in the first frame.Sherer’s first goal came just four minutes and four seconds into the game, scoring off a penalty corner from Allison Anjulo. Connecticut struck again 22 seconds later, this time off a tip from a center cross. After another penalty corner resulted in a Husky goal just after the eight-minute mark, Connecticut held a 3-0 advantage. Sherer scored again at 9:40 for the Huskies’ fourth goal in the game’s first ten minutes. Connecticut’s final score of the first half came at 18:49, and the Huskies rolled to a 5-0 halftime lead.“It was a great experience playing such a talented team,” said co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon, who felt the tough matchup would improve her team’s play in the future.“The speed of the game should raise our level of play,” Caples said.Despite a rough start, freshman goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos recorded 23 saves, six more than she made in her first four games combined.“[The high number of shot attempts] was expected from such a strong team as UConn, but I felt like our defense really stepped up and minimized [Connecticut’s] opportunities to score,” Tassopoulos said.Both Goodman-Bacon and Caples felt last night was Tassopoulos’ strongest performance of the season.“It was really outstanding,” Goodman-Bacon said. “She really had our backs in there.”Tassopoulos, a native of Dallas, Texas, has started in goal in each of the Crimson’s five games.“[Tassopoulos has] shown a lot of good leadership back there,” Caples said.In addition to a strong performance from the Harvard netminder, last night’s game showed Harvard could make effective adjustments. After allowing four goals within the first 10 minutes of play and five by the end of the period, the Crimson changed its press in an attempt to contain the Connecticut offense.And for the most part, it worked. Not only did the team allow just a single goal, but also its changed style of play presented it with more offensive opportunities.Sophomore Carly Dickson tried to get things going offensively for the Crimson in the second half, leading her team with two shot attempts.“I thought it took us a while to get used to [Connecticut’s] high-paced game, but we made the proper adjustments in the second half and played a noticeably better game,” Tassopoulos said.It was not until the last five minutes of the game that the Huskies added their final goal, this time from Robin Kleine.  Harvard started the season on a high note, earning three early non-conference victories before dropping its Ivy League opener against Yale, 4-3, last Saturday.Harvard hopes that last night’s strong second half play can carry over into its Ancient Eight home opener against Penn this Saturday. Specifically, the Crimson aims to employ a more organized attack.“We’re looking to find a rhythm early with our offensive attack and take the experience of playing a top team in the country into the rest of our season,” Tassopoulos said.Harvard’s next opponent, the 2-4 Quakers, should provide less of a challenge than No. 5 Connecticut. However, as Harvard enters the heart of its season, the team is not shying away from tougher matchups.“We’re excited to play more teams like UConn,” Goodman-Bacon said. “We’re just sort of getting into our season.”

Lamont Café has placed its Red Bull energy drinks—a top-selling item and all-nighter standby—behind a glass counter after drinks began disappearing from their former open-air home in front of the bar.
Café operations manager Mark A. Terrelonge ’10 said from his perch behind the counter late last night that even when the cafe was locked-down after 2 a.m., desperate students appeared able to pilfer fuel for their cram sessions.
"People with small hands were able to squeeze their hands into the grate and steal the Red Bull," he explained.
"Just people with hands!" added Halle K. Phillips ’11, who was working the late shift at Lamont Café and is also an associate Crimson photo editor.
Terrelonge declined to describe any known instances of Red Bull robbery, but he said that Harvard University Dining Services administrator Kim Smith—who manages the illustrious library café from the HUDS side—had urged the student managers to put the Red Bulls behind the glass. Smith could not be reached for comment.
In spite of this increased wariness, Terrelonge, a neurobiology concentrator in Lowell House, said that Lamont Café still provides "the top entertainment for customers."
"We dance 10-2 on Tuesday evenings—for tips," he said.

Math has never really been FlyBy's best subject, so there are limited options when it comes to fulfilling the dreaded QR requirement--or, excuse us--the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning category under the "new" Gen. Ed. curriculum. On the one hand, there are classes like "Bits" and "The Magic of Numbers" that seem geared to the fluffier humanities types, and on the other, there are the departmental courses, which, yes, provide solid, mathematical instruction but are basically just harder versions of the math you couldn't even handle in high school.
The one departmental QR-fulfilling course that was always welcoming, however, especially for those who balk at the sight of numbers, was Math Xa, the basic introduction to calculus offered every fall. But now Math Xa is nominally no more, having been replaced this fall with Math "Ma." The reason for the name change? So far no response from the math department, so for now, our theories—after the jump.
UPDATE: Math preceptor Jameel Al-Aidroos writes in an e-mail that the name change came "at the request of students and administrators" because students didn't like the name. How they arrived at M? Still unclear.
The "Math Ma" syllabus seems very similar (if not identical) to "Math Xa," so it's difficult to determine what exactly this new title means.
Maybe "X," a letter often used as a variable in mathematics was a little too intimidating.
Maybe it reminded too many freshman last year of the blood-red ink and sweaty palms of high school math tests.
Or maybe "Ma" connotes a more maternal, welcoming, and loving environment that will be implemented in the course this year. And who knows? Maybe there will eventually be a spring semester sequel course called "Math Pa" that really lays down the law and separates the men from the boys....
Maybe they have too much time on their hands.

Students heading to Harvard Hillel tomorrow may find themselves on national TV—in Korea. Of all visitors to campus, the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) will be in town tomorrow to film a roundtable discussion at Hillel in which students share their experiences as American Jewish college students with Korea’s foremost public television station, which is creating a documentary on Jewish life in America.
Hillel Associate Director Michael Simon said he was contacted by KBS this summer. “This was an unusual request, so we were intrigued,” he said.  He was even more impressed when he realized that the intern who called him had stayed up until 2 a.m. in Korea in order to be able to call him at a reasonable time in America.
Hillel’s leaders were excited about the chance to share the “diverse expressions in the Jewish tradition” with audiences across the world, so they decided to put together the roundtable discussion.  At least 25 students will join in the filmed conversation tomorrow.
