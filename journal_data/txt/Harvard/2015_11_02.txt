After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past year, Introduction to Computer Science, also known as CS50, claimed the crown of Harvard’s most popular class, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences received the largest gift in school history, and the School of Public Health was renamed after its own record-setting donation. But fields that more clearly lead to individual professions grow at the University, some argue that the humanities are dying.
The numbers lend some credence to this claim. As a recent Crimson scrutiny pointed out, just 14 percent of Harvard’s Class of 2014 concentrated in the humanities, an 8 percent drop from a decade ago. Nationwide, the decline has been even sharper: The total number of undergraduate degrees awarded in the humanities has halved since the late 1960s.
The trend largely stems from the misperception, both on this campus and on others across the country, that the skills learned in the humanities are not professionally marketable. But in reality, humanities concentrators simply accumulate a different skillset. Whereas computer science concentrators learn to code, English concentrators learn to read analytically and write. One hands in a problem; the other, an essay. That difference reflects nothing more than different modes of learning. Furthermore, even in the more technical professional fields, many report back that the most important skills are those learned on the job.
It is true that jobs may be more difficult to find for those who concentrate in the humanities. One study showed that the unemployment rate for engineers rests about five percent lower than for those who studied the humanities in college. But this line of thought misses the point—college should be a time when students seize the opportunity to study what they are most passionate about. This is especially true here at Harvard, where students have the privilege of studying whatever they want and still have abundant job prospects upon graduation by virtue of the University’s prestige, regardless of their intended field. Further, in following their passions, students will inevitably gain skills and experiences that will serve them well in the future, regardless of occupation or discipline. As the Crimson scrutiny described, “For Harvard graduates, the question is not so much whether you’ll get a job with a humanities degree—it’s where.”
Moreover, studying the humanities does not close off students from taking other courses that may be more directly applicable to one’s career goals, assuming they lie elsewhere. For example, some students choose to concentrate in the humanities while fulfilling pre-medicine requirements; others choose a secondary in a more quantitative field. Given the 32 credits Harvard undergraduates must complete before graduation, the two are not mutually exclusive.
This semester, Harvard introduced its newest concentration, “Theater, Dance and Media.” At the launching ceremony for TDM, Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen said, “The arts are central to the 21st century citizen that we are hoping to educate.” This was, and still is, true. The humanities have long held a central place in the mission and purpose of this University. We must continue to cherish and honor their value.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his Times column last Friday, David Brooks predicted that the plausibly imminent Rubio-Ryan era of Republican politics will provide us the “wonkiest leadership team in our lifetime.”
It’s about damn time.
Republicans bear the bad rap of being the party without a clear-cut policy agenda. Much of this perception is unfair. Their opponents often misleadingly equate the belief in separating private from civic life with a belief in lawlessness altogether. When that doesn’t work, they render all Republican policymakers as simple Simons.
But, admittedly, far from unintellectual, conservatism is nonetheless undetailed. It’s often moral leadership, not big ideas, that attracts the base. Attempts at the latter come with the deadly risks of unleashing the contrarian populist wrath of the grassroots, and far worse, of accusations of pretension.
A related issue is that policy isn’t sexy. Talk-show hosts and debate moderators eschew substance for far more accessible, and far more salable, discussions of pageantry or principles—like the vague or loaded so-called “gotcha” questions in the last couple Republican debates. Only by listening hard enough through the bombastic rhetoric of the vacuous pundits on the right will you hear the faint murmurs of the policy wonks.
It comes as no surprise then that the Republican leadership of the past decade has been strikingly unwonky. Boehner’s strength and recently his weakness was that he made deals, not policy. A far cry from little, nerdy Jeb, Bushes 41 and 43 gained political capital with their unassuming, and as one of my professors so eagerly points out, unintellectual brand of leadership.
So, why is a wonk like Paul Ryan the next Speaker of our House? And why is a wonk like Marco Rubio the likely Republican nominee to be our next President?
It’s because this year, wonky became cool, and cool politicians became wonky.
Policy writing, perhaps more than anything in politics, captures the millennial ethos: opportunities for innovative problem-solving, an emphasis on technical details, a rejection of the orthodoxy. The information generation seems to prefer specific policy ideas over broad ideological strokes.
They also like Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio—who aren’t just wonky, but also young and cool. Rubio especially capitalizes on his relatability: Whether it’s his rah-rah pride over his alma mater or his impromptu football games on the campaign trails, there’s something about the Florida senator that makes young voters overwhelmingly want to connect with him. Ryan had a similar strategy back in 2012, famously doing a workout photo shoot and selling himself as a fitness buff.
And just as Ryan found his niche as the numbers guy in the House, chairing the Ways and Means Committee and sponsoring over 70 bills, Rubio is emerging as the ideas man in the 2016 presidential field. He released by far the most comprehensive and feasible tax plan, his education plan is similarly nuanced, and his foreign policy expertise is unparalleled—his prediction during the second Republican debate that Russia would fill the vacuum President Obama left in Syria actually came through.
Wonkiness and likeability are certainly not mutually causal this election cycle. Rubio lies in stark contrast to the two other legitimate contenders for the presidency: Jeb Bush, who’s wonky but not cool, and Ben Carson, who’s cool—or at least unflashy and therefore appealing—but is anything but policy minded.
But still, Rubio and Ryan represent a new generation of conservative populations who are both intelligent and not overbearing, moving the Republican party away from a period of intellectual stagnancy and idle emphasis on moral leadership. In an era when the trite criticism against Republicans is that they’re moving the country backwards, Rubio and Ryan will move us unabashedly forward.

A book is a ravine in the fingerprint of the human conscience. Not only do books record the thoughts of man, but they provide shelter—an insightful distraction—from the readers’ struggles.
Like dampened red earth, a book’s words shape a landscape to be viewed under the eyes of the beholder. The conditions of the journey are painted by the reader. Thoreau states in “Walden” that he “went to the woods because [he] wished to lived deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if [he] could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when [he] came to die, discover that [he] had not lived”. I sometimes descend into the canyon in times of struggle, to face “only the essential facts of life.” “Walden” laid out a map that helped me better question the habits of daily life, and ponder on my own level of satisfaction and appreciation. I trekked the chapter “Where I Lived and What I Lived For” for the first time in my high school English class. My hands firmly grasping the Bible-thin pages to support its spine, my Norton Anthology was like a face I could open to access the courage needed to actively confront my own thoughts. When reading I did not have to be passive to suppress the feelings of despair. I could disagree, say how I felt back, and not be as afraid to get damaged any more emotionally. During this time last year—my first year away from home—I was a book to my mother, a place she could go when she had no one to talk to. My dad, although not officially diagnosed, has post-traumatic stress disorder. He is still my world, but in times there are earthquakes and avalanches that take place due to his old scars of battle, both from an impoverished, abusive childhood, and from war.
One Saturday, when visiting home, there was a verbal eruption. He grabbed the truck keys on the metal rack in the kitchen. My dad walked out the door. The verbal snap, the explosion, sent shock waves through my body. I was weak. I could not stay to have my pages read by my mom, to look upon my sister’s face, to answer the questions of a five year-old brother. I ran into the woods across the street from my house, only to come back an hour later with my hair dripping wet from the rain.
The drops from my eyes blended with the tears of the sky, and both fell onto my pages of “Walden” while I was curled up with my dolphin pillow-pet in my old room. I read to stay busy. Staying busy was a way to cope; doing homework was a subtle form to venture away and reflect. I could not speak of what haunted me like my mother did to me during those few months when his outbursts were often and I was away. Rather, within the lines of “Walden,” I read, “Time is but a stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars.” From in-between the words of Thoreau, the stream cleansed my eyes from the dust. Time is always passing, life is ever-changing. This particular instance of the cursing, the slamming door, the start of the engine, was a pebble that will not be touched by the same section of the current again. The ripples would not steer me off course. I could take sips of the stream, realizing some would be sourer than others, and recognize that all drinks of feeling and emotion are necessary to experience life deliberately and fully. I must know pain to appreciate pleasure.
The same water flows through my veins. It gave, and still gives me the strength to march forward with my head held high. Returning from the canyon to the bedroom of a once teenage girl, the trail has been momentarily cleared. Although now at times I worry what distance will do to the relation I have with my mom as the years go by, I choose to savor the current sweetness of the stream. My parents are strong. My dad continually battles to control the pain of a broken body and the unintentional rage that tears apart through guilt, which rips the rest of us through fear and sorrow. Yet we are supportive, and most importantly, together—a luxury we have not always had. Perhaps the distance will give me courage to take both of my parents to Walden Pond when they next visit me, to get our feet wet, and smile while the sun blazes high in the sky full of eternal stars.
Yet I know I will strive to follow the ridges of my own fingerprint, only to value the words of the past, but not get lost within them. Books rest on nearby shelves. I climb forth on solid grounds. The water is still flowing, pebbles are still untouched.

In early September, Adams House underwent a subtle but substantial change: Administrators relabeled bathrooms throughout the House, replacing some gender-specific restrooms with gender-neutral ones.
“We wanted to make a statement about everyone being welcome in the House,” Adams House dean Adam Muri-Rosenthal said. “We could have avoided all gender-related issues by just putting a sign on the door that said ‘restroom,’ but we wanted to be actively welcoming.”
Van Bailey, the director of the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, praised Adams House, which joins several other buildings on campus—including Boylston Hall basement and the Women’s Center, according to Bailey—in introducing gender-neutral bathrooms. Other Houses, Bailey said, have gender-neutral restrooms, but they are not labeled overtly as “gender-neutral” like some in Adams now are.
“Adams has always been historically supportive of the BGLTQ community,” Bailey said, referring to how Adams was generally recognized as a safe space for BGLTQ students before upperclassman housing became randomized in the 1990s. “It’s going to provide safer places so that BGLTQ folks don’t feel like they have to choose between gender designations,” Bailey added.
The idea to change the signs came about during an exercise about identity the Adams’s dean, House masters, and tutors took part in during their summer training. Participants were asked to write down aspects of identity that might not be apparent to others, Muri-Rosenthal said.
“It was a really illuminating exercise for everyone and one of the things that happened as a result was a conversation about gender identity and the bathrooms in the House,” he said.
Students in Adams said they are supportive of the House’s relabeled bathrooms. Still, Harvard needs more gender-neutral bathrooms across its campus, said Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, an Adams House resident and intern at the BGLTQ Office of Student Life.
“There are far too few gender-neutral bathrooms at Harvard—in academic buildings, in Houses, in the Yard,” Blecher-Cohen said. “That lack materially impacts the safety and wellbeing of BGLTQ students on this campus.”
Blecher-Cohen said he hopes that other Houses and other campus buildings follow Adams’s lead.
“I’ve found other students wondering why this shift is only now starting to happen, and strongly on board with a push to make all single-stall bathrooms gender-neutral,” he said.

Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement marched down Massachusetts Avenue on Sunday afternoon, rallying for affordable housing protection and wage reform in Cambridge. The rally fell just two days before Tuesday’s Cambridge City Council and Cambridge School Committee elections.
About 100 demonstrators gathered at Cambridge’s City Hall with hand-painted signs bearing slogans such as “Fight for $15,” “Youth Development, Not Corporate Development,” and “Raise Wages, Not Rent.” The march proceeded across the city to Kendall Square, stopping at three sites which Black Lives Matter Cambridge organizers said pointed to the corporate development and gentrification of the city.
“People of color, low-income people, and people living in the projects are scared about how quickly affordable housing is disappearing from Cambridge,” said Stephanie Guirand, a lead coordinator of the group.
Guirand and other demonstrators called on Cambridge City Council candidates to support the expansion of non-profit and low-and-middle-income housing developments.
Several candidates for Cambridge City Council also marched with the advocates, garnering praise from organizers for what they described as progressive agendas and “common sense,” though they added that BLM Cambridge does not endorse candidates. City Council candidates in attendance included Mike Connolly, Jan Devereux, Ilan Levy, Nadeem A. Mazen, and Romaine Waite.
“For my whole life, I have heard it said that we need to have a dialogue about race, and as a white person and someone who is white-privileged, that’s something that I’ve always wanted to do, but the Black Lives Matter movement has really made the dialogue about race happen in this city,” Connolly said.
In a speech before the crowd, Waite claimed that the affluence of Harvard and MIT students is a factor in rising Cambridge rent prices. He declined to comment further to The Crimson.
For his part, Dillon “Dil” C. Harvey, a Cambridge housing search advocate for the poor and homeless, led chants calling for “Housing for the people, jobs for the people” and “Cambridge for the 99 percent, not the 1 percent.”
“I am witnessing the eradication of subsidized and truly affordable housing firsthand because I have clients who have been on waiting lists [for housing] for years,” Harvey said. “So many marginalized folks get knocked out of eligibility due to credit or quarry checks.”
Kevin E. O’Donnell ’16, a Harvard student who is currently on leave, was among the participants. He said his interests in the rally stemmed from the intersection between urban planning and racial justice.
“Urban space is the future of our lives,” O’Donnell said. “So if we don’t have a say in it, people who don’t have our best interests at heart will be the ones who dictate how the city looks.”
In a Kendall Square business park, Cambridge teenagers Don Michel and Marquis Tashawn Taylor closed the demonstration with a rap song about their own experiences.

The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology hosted a Day of the Dead celebration—also known as “Día de los Muertos”—on Sunday, when museum patrons learned about the Mexican holiday through participating in traditions and sampling a range of foods, including “pan de muerto” and Mexican hot chocolate.
Polly R. Hubbard, the Peabody Museum’s education manager, described the holiday as a way of “welcoming back spirits of people who have passed on...with joy and happiness, and remembering what they were like...instead of woefully missing them.”
As one of the celebrated traditions, holiday participants create family altars that provide offerings to the dead. Making the day relevant to local residents, the Peabody featured not only an altar by Mexican artist Javier Gonzáles Rodríguez but also those created by local Cambridge students. Gonzáles Rodríguez said he tried to reflect his origins in the altar, having painted skulls in the traditional style of dorado and constructed marigolds made from cornhusks that came from his hometown.
At the entrance stood personal altars that eighth-grade students at Amigos School, a dual-language school in Cambridge that teaches students in both English and Spanish, adorned with photographs of and letters to their lost loved ones. In this interactive display, the Peabody’s visitors then left messages for their own lost loved ones at the students’ altars.
In addition to surveying the altars, parents and young children decorated sugar skulls and enjoyed performances by on-campus student mariachi troupe Mariachi Veritas and Mexican folk dance group Harvard Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán.
According to Hubbard, the Peabody Museum has conducted research in the Mexican and Mesoamerican region for more than 100 years.
“As an archeology museum, we have a deep history with the region, and this is a way to connect to that,” Hubbard said.
According to the museum’s education specialist, Andrew S. Majewski, planning for the event started over the summer. At that time, organizers contacted Harvard student groups as well as the artisans Ventura and son Norberto Fabian, who came from Oaxaca, Mexico, to demonstrate their woodcarving craft at Sunday’s event.
Anna Garnica attended the event from New Hampshire in hopes of teaching her family more about their Mexican culture.
“It’s a time to remember and honor people in the family and friends that have passed away in this life,” Garnica said

With eyes closed, it would seem that a DJ, drums, a turntable, and a mixer equipped the basement of “Arts @ 29 Garden”—a University space for collaboration and experimentation of art-making among faculty, students and visiting artists—on Friday afternoon.
Yet all of these sounds were created by one man’s mouth as beatboxing enthusiasts convened for a workshop and performance, titled "The Art of Beatboxing," that featured renowned beatboxers from around the world and was sponsored by the Office for the Arts.
“Beatboxing is a relatively new form of music and performance and a very underrepresented and underappreciated art form that sprang from hip-hop culture and sort of faded out,” said Devon M. Guinn ’17, a student coordinator for the event. “So we’re trying to raise awareness for how unbelievably talented many beatboxers are and how great it is.”
The workshop kicked off with a question and answer session with a panel of professionals, including World Beatbox Association co-founder Chesney Snow, executive producer of documentary “American Beatboxer” Rich McKeown, current beatbox world champion Alem, two-time Grand Beatbox Battle champion Dharni, and swissbeatbox.com creator Pepouni.
Following the panel discussion, Dharni and Alem taught the audience beatboxing basics in an interactive workshop and performed together before opening it up to audience participation. The event concluded with a screening of the pilot of “American Beatboxer: the Docu-Series.”
Throughout the event, participants said that a key element in beatboxing is a love of the craft.
“It’s all about passion,” Pepouni said. “It’s such a big door opener. You can do so many things with beatboxing when passion kicks in. Once you’re in that world, you can’t get out.”
The event organizers said they hoped the workshop would raise the profile of beatboxing as an art form.
“You wouldn’t see an ad for taking beatbox lessons, you’d see an ad for taking piano lessons, but beatboxing is like any other instrument,” Guinn said. “You can hone it and do amazing shows.”
Other attendees echoed Guinn’s sentiment.

After almost an hour of debate, Undergraduate Council representatives voted 31 on Sunday to 11 to push a referendum asking students if the Pusey Library should “be transformed into a freshmen-oriented social space” to this month’s presidential election ballot.
The referendum’s supporters argued that the library’s location in the center of Harvard Yard could prove effective in transforming it into a safe and inclusive environment geared toward freshmen, a group representatives said lacks adequate social space.
Still, the legislation proposing the referendum provoked heavy debate and some criticism from the Council, which last year voted down a proposal to fast-track a referendum on course section sizes to the ballot.
Some representatives argued that the proposal sounded like a “crazy idea” and that advocates would likely need to draw up a detailed plan before enacting any plans. Student Life Committee Chair Oliver W. Kim ’16 said the proposal would likely be infeasible; he underwent an unsuccessful campaign in previous years to turn portions of the Pusey Library into a student nap space.
Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, meanwhile, took issue with the referendum’s premise. Levine, an inactive Crimson news writer, said many people, especially Harvard faculty, see the library as a “treasured academic resource.”
But despite the debate, the UC ultimately secured the referendum a place on the November ballot after members discussed tweaking it. Eliot House Representative David P. Frankle ’18 proposed an amendment to the legislation to phrase the referendum in a way that would show no bias towards students’ class years to then appeal to more students.
The amendment to eliminate wording appealing to freshmen ultimately failed with a vote of 10 for the amendment, 24 against, and eight abstaining. Representatives against the amendment argued that freshmen in particular suffer from a lack of common and social space on campus.
“I think if we’re actually going to talk about social spaces at Harvard, we need to call the issues like they are,” Student Initiatives Committee Co-Chair Daniel V. Banks ’17 said. “If we’re going to address social life, we need to talk about the fact that freshmen have no ownership over spaces on campus.”
With Sunday’s successful vote, the library issue joins three other referenda on the ballot for the UC’s presidential election, which will take place later this month. One referendum calls on Harvard administrators to add a provision to the student handbook banning students from joining male final clubs; another advocates for increased levels of student input in Harvard’s sexual assault policies; and a third seeks to ban student meetings from taking place at breakfast time.
The other three issues gained their spots on the ballot after students gathered 670 student signatures, or about 10 percent of the College’s student body, to garner support for the question.
This referendum, which will appear on the ballot in the UC’s upcoming presidential elections, follows campus-wide discussion about social life at the College and the role of unrecognized student groups like final clubs. Recently, on the heels of student calls for more on-campus social spaces, administrators have funded social events for the student body at large, such as a large outdoor party hosted by women’s groups and a College-wide Halloween party, which took place in Annenberg Hall on Saturday.

Harvard’s library system has reduced spending by $25 million in aggregate since 2009, largely due to a multi-year restructuring effort completed in 2012, according to an update distributed to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences prior to its meeting on Tuesday.
A working group developed a savings benchmark of $20 million in 2009 and 2010 based on projections about efficiency gains and reducing duplications in collections. That group crafted goals for the integration of the University’s 73 libraries into a single Harvard Library based on recommendations from a 2009 report from the task force on University libraries. The savings are calculated relative to the 2009 budget inflated to current dollars, according to the update obtained by The Crimson.
From 2010 to 2012, University administrators reshuffled and streamlined administrative positions in the library system to reduce inefficiencies and reallocate resources to better balance the needs of a centralized library. 
The number of employees in the library system dropped from 1,094 in 2009 to 771 in 2015, a nearly 30 percent decrease, the document says. The restructuring effort included transfers of staff to other administrative offices—such as human resource staff and technology specialists—but also involved controversial cuts to staffing. Spending on salaries decreased from 53.2 to 50 percent of total spending within the library system between 2009 and 2014.
There is a multi-year plan in place to reduce the Harvard Library’s budget by another $7 million, according to the document, with total savings expected to exceed $32 million from 2009 expenditures by 2020. The document’s title, meanwhile, suggests a sense of conclusion: “Closing the Book on the Transition: The Harvard Library.”
Reforms stretched into 2013, including new administrative hires like Sarah E. Thomas, who was appointed vice president for the Harvard Library and later that year to head the FAS libraries. Following the departure of Robert C. Darnton ’60 last June, Thomas was also named University Librarian, placing her clearly at the helm of the library system.
Suggesting that “budgetary accomplishments hardly resonate in the academic community,” the document also highlights various initiatives Harvard has undertaken alongside the restructuring efforts, including the new HOLLIS+ online search feature, borrowing services within Harvard and between other schools, digitization initiatives, and budget increases for collecting new sources.
The Harvard Library increased the portion of its spending on materials from 28.7 percent in 2009 by 36.4 percent in 2014, the document says. The University’s investment in library materials now totals $44.8 million, beating Yale, its nearest peer, by $6 million.
Thomas will present an update on the library system to the Faculty at its monthly meeting on Tuesday. A brochure on the Harvard Library for the University’s ongoing capital campaign was also distributed to faculty members ahead of the meeting.
Harvard’s library system is the largest academic library in the world. In the United States, only the Library of Congress and the Boston Public Library system contain more volumes, according to the American Library Association. Both are public libraries.

A new student movement at Harvard Law School is organizing to change the seal at the school, which the students argue represents and endorses a slaveholding legacy. The seal is the coat of arms of the family of Isaac Royall Jr., a slaveholder who endowed the first professorship of law at Harvard.
Dubbed “Royall Must Fall,” the movement styles itself after a student activist movement in South Africa that lobbied to remove imagery of Cecil Rhodes, a British imperialist, from the University of Cape Town’s campus. At Harvard, activists formally began their effort for change with a rally of about 25 people on the Law School campus on Oct. 23.
They have launched a Facebook page and are now in the process of further organizing. They are drafting a letter to send to the Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow with their positions, according to Mawuse H. Vormawor, a Law School student and organizer of the effort.
Students involved in the effort argued that imagery from a slaveholding era has no place at today’s Harvard Law School.
“These symbols set the tone for the rest of the school and the fact that we hold up the Harvard crest as something to be proud of when it represents something so ugly is a profound disappointment and should be a source of shame for the whole school,” said Alexander J. Clayborne, one of the Law students involved.
Vormawor pointed to the research and scholarship of visiting Law School professor Daniel R. Coquillette, who recently published a book about the first century of Harvard Law School, as inspiration for the movement. In the book, Coquillette details the relationship between the Royall family’s slaveholding and the endowment of the Law School.
While Coquillette said he was sympathetic to their aims, calling Royall “a coward, and a brutal slaveholder,” he said he does not think the Law School should change its seal.
“As a historian...you just deal with the fact that this guy founded the school and tell the truth about it,” he said. “To change things is to act like [they] didn’t happen, and that’s a mistake.”
The current student movement is not the first time the Law School’s slaveholding legacy has been examined on campus. When Janet E. Halley was appointed the Royall Professor of Law in 2006, she delivered remarks that explored the relationship between Royall’s slaveholding wealth and Harvard Law School.
“As the holder of the Royall Chair, I think it’s extremely important that we own the Royall legacy,” Halley said. “I would be happy to send anyone my Chair lecture about my thoughts on that and to work with anybody in the community who thinks that it’s important for us to responsibly and humanely grasp this thistle.”
For student activists, the movement is still very young—just weeks old—and still subject to change.
“Inasmuch as this is a conversation that we are having on this issue and even though this movement is called ‘Royall Must Fall,’ it is not closed to suggestions,” Vormawor said.

By mid-2017, Harvard Law School’s entire collection of United States case law will be available for public search through a new online legal platform, Ravel Law, which will provide the contents of its database for bulk access for free over the next eight years.
While case law documents are nominally within the public realm, actually accessing them often requires paying an intermediary like LexisNexis or Westlaw.
“What comes from a judge's quill should be freely available to all,” Jonathan L. Zittrain, the director of the Law School library, wrote in an email. “This project is a step along an overdue path towards making the law worldwide freely available and searchable through as many means as there are games in an app store.”
The project, dubbed “Free the Law,” will roll out case law in phases, first releasing California case law this fall. Ravel will present visual guides that aim to break down complex legal concepts, according to Ravel’s website.
Six full-time librarians at the Harvard Library Innovation Laboratory are using a high-tech scanner for the first time to digitize up to 500,000 pages a day, according to Adam B. Ziegler, the manager of special projects at the Law School library. Ravel is helping to financially support the expensive digitization effort.
The initiative aims to make the practice of law easier for the public to understand and access and more equitable for smaller or less wealthy legal advocates, organizers and supporters of the project said.
“Using technology to create broad access to legal information will help create a more transparent and more just legal system,” Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said in a statement.
Zittrain, who is also a Law School professor and faculty director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, taught Daniel Lewis, the chief executive of Ravel, as a student at Stanford Law. Lewis founded Ravel in 2012, and the inspiration for the digitization project was born out of a conversation between professor and former student, according to Zittrain.
In a statement, Lewis said that the desire to make legal records publicly accessible drove Ravel’s decision to collaborate with the Law School.
“By collaborating together on this digitization effort, we hope to provide the public with unique and powerful ways to find and understand the law,” Lewis said.
The announcement of the project comes as the digitization of scholarly materials becomes a priority across Harvard’s library system. The Harvard College Library Digitization Program has undertaken similar efforts in recent years to make collections across the College libraries available online. Zittrain wrote in an email that the Law School effort, though consistent with the University-wide push, has more practical applications.
“It's consonant with those efforts, though with materials that have a special meaning, since they represent not only materials of scholarly interest, but the law itself,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In four separate town hall meetings over the past month, faculty members and administrators have vetted proposals to drastically overhaul the College’s General Education program, according to copies of meeting minutes obtained by The Crimson. The changes discussed would lower the number of required courses and make stricter requirements for departmental courses’ inclusion in the program.
Since last semester’s release of a Gen Ed review that characterized the program as “failing on a variety of fronts,” Harvard’s foundational curriculum has come under fire from faculty who have blamed the report’s findings primarily on the program’s implementation. 
In the meantime, the Gen Ed review committee has held the four town halls to generate broader faculty discussion and gauge opinions about the current program. The outcome of those conversations, which were closed to the press, will be on display Tuesday, when the committee is expected to present a summary of recommendations to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, according to the minutes of the final town hall meeting, held Oct. 27.
At the Faculty’s December meeting, the committee is slated to propose formal legislation, on which professors would vote in the spring, according to the minutes of the final town hall.
According to the meeting minutes, which detail the back-and-forth between attendees but do not name most individual speakers, committee members have discussed proposing three main changes to the Gen Ed program: It generally should no longer include “back of the book,” or departmental, courses; the program should have fewer requirements; and “some version” of the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement should continue as an additional quantitative reasoning requirement.
The current Gen Ed category of Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning received particular scrutiny at the meetings: It was described as a “failure” because of its lack of true Gen Ed courses and inclusion of primarily departmental courses.
At the four town halls, some attendees suggested that the program is too restrictive for students with its eight required courses. Conversations at the meetings focused in part on lowering the number of required Gen Ed courses, which attendees said would give students more freedom to explore elective courses.
Committee members and professors have previously suggested that there are too many courses in the program with department offerings counting for Gen Ed credit, leaving it unwieldy and lacking a defined identity.
But several attendees of the fall’s town hall meetings suggested that reducing the number of requirements might delegitimize the Gen Ed program. Other attendees worried that Gen Ed course enrollment sizes would increase if the program included fewer requirements.
Attendees also discussed loosely structuring revised requirements around FAS’s three divisions—arts and humanities, social sciences, and sciences—and including requirements that involved ethics or ethical reasoning.
The committee’s loose belief is that “Gen Ed courses should get as much if not more support as HarvardX courses get,” according to the final meeting minutes. Specifically, committee representatives outlined three other proposals to faculty members at the town halls: They suggested that the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning should provide faculty with course development support; sections for Gen Ed courses should have a target size of 12 and a cap of 14; and Harvard should train training teaching fellows specific to the program.
More broadly, committee members also said that departments should think of the program as important to their teaching obligations.
The Gen Ed review committee began its work in the spring of 2014 as part of the first review of the program since its launch in 2009. In the years of crafting and implementation leading up to the launch, the program became a victim first of administrative turnover and then financial uncertainty, when resources and administrative attention were siphoned away to deal with the impacts of the global financial crisis. As a result, the program failed to address many of the criticisms that plagued its predecessor, the Core.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 4, 2015, at 7:13 a.m.
The Harvard cross country teams fell short of their goals of competing for an Ancient Eight title after both the men’s and women’s sides finished seventh at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, but the women’s team performance was anchored by another strong outing from sophomore Courtney Smith.
At Van Cortlandt Park in New York City, N.Y., the Crimson faced off against stiff competition in its last race before the NCAA regional qualifiers, including the likes of No. 17 ranked Columbia and No. 29 Penn on the men’s side and No. 20 Princeton and No. 25 Columbia on the women’s.
These seeds turned out to be well-justified, as the top-ranked teams both finished at the top of the podium by the end of the day. But while the Penn men finished with their predicted second-place result, the Yale women were able to sneak in and grab silver, leading to nationally-ranked Columbia earning third.
Finishing well behind these leaders, the Harvard men continued turned in performances reminiscent of those in other races throughout the season, while the women could not repeat their early season successes against Ivy League competitors. Ultimately, the women just missed matching their fifth-place finish in last year’s championships, while the men repeated their result.
“The races were ok, I would’ve preferred our teams to be up a bit higher, but I was proud of the way that [they] competed,” said ninth-year Crimson head coach Jason Saretsky. “I was particularly impressed with and happy with Courtney Smith competing for the win as a sophomore.”
Throughout much of the season, Smith has consistently been Harvard’s top performer and nothing changed at HEPS. Smith paced the Crimson women with a time of 20:55.9 in her six-kilometer race, placing third in the event, just a half a second behind Dartmouth’s Dana Giordano and eight seconds short of the winning mark set by Princeton’s Elizabeth Bird.
“[Smith] was a little bit disappointed [that she didn’t win], but also executed a good race plan and was really strong over the second half of the race,” Harvard coach Patrick Wales-Dinan said. “She didn’t have quite enough at the end to close the gap and finish in first. All in all, it’s a big step up from what she did last year…but there’s still work to be done.”
Smith has indeed made great strides from her freshman year, when she finished 56th in the event with a time that was 1:37 behind Giordana’s second place mark last year.
Finishing over a minute behind Smith, sophomore Elianna Shwayder’s 25th-place result was the Crimson’s next best, shortly followed by freshman Kathryn Gillespie and senior Emma Payne. Both were within seven seconds of Shwayder’s results. Junior Rachel Hampton finished off Harvard’s scoring on the day with her 50th-place finish.
Unlike the Crimson women, the men did not have an outstanding performer finishing at the top of the field, but the group had a well-rounded effort instead.
Co-captain Thomas Purnell fought his way to a 25:23.6 finish in the five-mile race, placing 24th in the field and snagged Harvard’s top result for the second year in a row. However, the time was still nearly a minute behind the mark of 24:26.4 set by pacesetter, Thomas Awad, of Penn.
Both finishing within sixteen seconds of Purnell, co-captain Chris Allen and freshman Austin Gilbert, placed 33rd and 37th, respectively. Gilbert’s time of 25:39.0 was good enough for fourth-best among all Ivy League rookies. He has continued to shine throughout his freshman campaign with the Crimson.
“Austin’s been a great freshman for us so far. He’s come in with some big expectations and he’s done really well,” Wales-Dinan said. “We’ve been pleased to have him on the team and add him to the group.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into one of the biggest weekends of Ivy League play, the women’s volleyball teams from Harvard and Dartmouth entered Friday tied for first in the standings, facing the exact same slate of games––away at Penn and away at Princeton. After four games and 1,350 miles of total travel for the top two teams in the league, it was the Crimson that emerged in sole possession of the top spot.
While Harvard (11-9, 7-3 Ivy) split its games, beating the Quakers (10-12, 4-6) on Friday and falling to the Tigers (11-8, 6-4) on Saturday, Dartmouth (9-10, 6-4) faltered against both opponents.
Princeton 3, Harvard 0
After dropping the first set, 25-22, Harvard came back at Princeton with its best shot. Playing in front of an energized crowd at Dillon Gym, however, the Tigers parried every Crimson attack and sent the second set through a total of 18 ties and 11 lead changes.
At 25-25, Harvard’s push to tie the game finally came short. Princeton’s setter Claire Nussbaum teed up her teammates for two straight kills, and after a grueling set in which the Crimson threatened to take control at various points, it suddenly found itself down 2-0 heading into the third set.
Coming back once again proved to be too difficult of a task for Harvard, which was also facing fatigue from having played the night before. The Tigers never trailed in the third set after a 3-3 tie, and their lead ballooned to 21-12 at one point. Despite the Crimson rallying to close the difference to 22-18, the visitors once again were not able to finish the run, as Princeton tallied three straight points to end the game.
The first set, which set the tone for the 3-0 Tigers victory, had been similar to the third. Princeton quickly pulled ahead, 4-1, and held 12-6 lead at one point. Harvard drew close and forced several ties late in the set but never broke through.
“They scouted us well and stepped up during the crucial points,” senior libero Sindhu Vegesena said. “We’re usually cohesive, but our connections were slightly off against them.”
Senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace posted a strong performance for the Crimson in the losing effort, recording 32 total attack attempts and 11 kills. However, she and her teammates were not able to overcome the Tigers’ duo of outside-hitters, Cara Mattaliano and Kendall Peterkin, as the upperclassmen recorded 16 and 15 kills, respectively.
Harvard 3, Penn 0
Harvard started out the weekend on a higher note in a straight-set victory at Penn. In a commanding performance, the Crimson held the hosts to under 20 points in each set of the match, which saw only six lead changes.
Most of the drama in the Friday night matchup against the Quakers came in the first set, when the Crimson found itself trailing 11-7. Still tied with Dartmouth for the league lead going into the game, a loss to Penn, the team with the second-worst record in the Ancient Eight, would have dealt a serious blow to Harvard’s title hopes.
Led by six kills from five different players, however, the Crimson ripped off an 11-2 run. Two straight service aces by freshman middle-blocker Christina Cornelius punctuated the quick turnaround.
“Penn always has a ton of energy, especially in their home gym,” junior setter Corie Bain said. “Our comeback in the first game showed our will and grit to win.”
Other standout performers included senior libero Sindhu Vegesena, who posted a game-high 25 digs, and Wallace, who led the Crimson with 32 attack attempts and 11 kills.
Thanks to the win over Penn–and Dartmouth’s two losses–Harvard now finds itself atop of the Ancient Eight standings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team found itself in an unfamiliar situation on Saturday afternoon.
Playing in a position other than first place in the Ivy League for the first time all season, the Crimson (7-7-2, 4-1-1 Ivy) played a scrappy, physical Dartmouth (7-4-4, 0-3-3) team to a 1-1 double-overtime tie on senior day at Jordan Field.
With Princeton’s win over Cornell and Harvard’s tie, the Tigers clinched the Ivy League championship and the league’s NCAA Tournament bid.
“It’s a tough way to have our last game out here, but there were a lot of games before that,” senior Emily Mosbacher said. “I walk away with just the best memories in the world. This has been my Harvard experience, and I’m so grateful for it.”
With the contest tied for the game’s final 52 minutes, the Crimson put all of its efforts into attempting to score the go-ahead goal. Harvard controlled the possession for the majority of the second half and overtime, peppering Big Green junior goalkeeper Casey Cousineau with shot after shot.
In overtime, junior forward Joan Fleischman had a shot stopped by a sliding Dartmouth defender. No one could cash in on junior forward Rachel Garcia’s cross. Junior forward Midge Purce hit the crossbar. Garcia hit another one high. No luck.
“They dug down, especially the last part of the game and overtime,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We were basically playing like we were down a goal almost the whole way because we knew we had to win. I’m proud of them. It wasn’t our best game, but they gave everything they had.”
Knowing that it needed to pick up at least one win and one tie in its next two contests and have Princeton lose or tie its next two, the Crimson entered the game with a sense of urgency. Harvard registered six first-half shots, but the Big Green defense ensured that the Crimson was held scoreless in the first half for the 11th time this season.
The real wake-up call did not come until the 56th minute when Dartmouth co-captain Lucielle Kozlov sent a cross through the Harvard defense that sophomore midfielder Lindsay Knutson knocked in to give the guests the lead.
“We all just got together and realized Dartmouth’s record isn’t great but they’re a great team, we had to take them seriously and we had to play our game and get it back,” Mosbacher said. “It wasn’t pretty, but we got one back.”
After cranking up the offensive pressure, the equalizer came when Purce’s free kick found Mosbacher’s head and eventually the back of the net. It was the second goal of the season for the senior and the 11th of her career.
“We worked really hard to get that goal back after going down,” Mosbacher said. “We just threw all our numbers forward at the end and going for it. We were willing to maybe lose if it meant winning because this was it for us, and we just had to go for it.”
While the Crimson pounded the Big Green zone with all of its midfielders and forwards, the outnumbered defense had to do its fair share of heavy lifting to keep the game tied. Junior goalkeeper Lizzie Durack made perhaps the save of the season when she got a fingertip on a Dartmouth shot attempt in the second overtime to knock the ball over the crossbar.
“[Lizzie and the defense] are amazing and that was an amazing save to not lose the game,” Leone said. “She was fantastic and the back line’s been like that all season.”
The defense has allowed only three goals in the team’s six Ivy League games, and Durack has made 16 saves in that span. Her six saves on Saturday were the most she has made in a conference game this season, but it was still not enough.
“We knew this was it for us,” Mosbacher said. “We had to win to even get a shot at the title, and we went for it. We went all out and it didn’t pan out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s ice hockey team notched a pair of season firsts at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this weekend.
The No. 8/7 Crimson (1-1-1, 1-1-1 ECAC) opened its two-game home set on Friday with a scoreless draw against No. 4/4 Clarkson to earn its first conference point of the season, then notched its first win with a 3-2 victory over St. Lawrence on Saturday.
HARVARD 3, ST. LAWRENCE 2
Senior forward Miye D’Oench scored twice, sophomore forward Haley Mullins tossed in the late game-winner, and Harvard overcame a late equalizer from St. Lawrence (4-6-1, 1-1-0) to beat the Saints.
With the game knotted at two, Mullins ripped a go-ahead shot past freshman SLU goaltender Sonjia Shelly with 1:34 left in the third period. The goal was Mullins’ first of the season, a year removed from her 11-point freshman campaign.
Right from the puck drop, however, St. Lawrence had the quicker step, scoring two-and-a-half minutes into the game off a faceoff win and a shot that beat junior goaltender Brianna Laing stick-side.
Laing made her first start this season for the Crimson and recorded 28 saves.
St. Lawrence went on to outshoot Harvard, 15-5, during the opening period, and took a 1-0 lead into the first intermission.
“We didn’t get the puck deep enough to give us a little momentum or allow our defensemen to make smart changes,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “We were back on our heels the entire twenty minutes and part of the second period as well.”
A bizarre protocol violation against Harvard transformed a would-be carryover power play into a 4-on-4 to open the second frame. The script for the ensuing SLU power play was flipped, though, when D’Oench scored shorthanded to tie the game at one.
“[Junior forward Sydney Daniels] was picking up the puck on the wall,” D’Oench said. “I just took off, hoping to either get a breakaway or at least win the race and burn a little more time. She ended up shooting it right at me, so I just caught it, put it down, and deked the goaltender.”
D’Oench scored again on the power play with 3.2 seconds on the second period clock, giving Harvard a 2-1 lead heading into the third.
The Saints tied the game late in the third period on senior forward Jenna Marks’ first score of the season, but the tied game was short-lived, as Mullins scored the game-winner soon thereafter.
HARVARD 0, CLARKSON 0
Crimson junior goaltender Molly Tissenbaum recorded 23 saves en route to her first career shutout, but Harvard’s offense couldn’t convert on six power plays as the ECAC rivals fought to a scoreless tie.
Clarkson (9-0-2, 0-0-2), the 2014 NCAA national champion, outscored its first nine opponents this season by a combined margin of 36-12. On Friday, the Golden Knights failed to win for the first time following a perfect 9-0 start.
The game also featured 12 penalties, seven of which came in the third period, though neither side was able to take advantage of the ensuing power plays.
“Penalties are going to happen,” Stone said. “We’re getting better at our kill, but it’s a work in progress. We have to just stay out of the box—that’s the best penalty kill.”
Making her first start in goal this season, Tissenbaum brought her career save percentage up to .954 with the shutout performance.
Tissenbaum’s counterpart, Clarkson sophomore goaltender Shea Tiley, recorded an identical 23 saves. Tiley was named the ECAC Hockey Goaltender of the Week earlier this season.
The best opportunity for the Crimson to score came late in the overtime period after a Harvard shot barely slipped through Tiley’s leg pads. The puck came to a stop before reaching the goal, and Crimson freshman forward Grace Zarzecki’s attempt to poke it in hit off the post. A last second try by senior defenseman Michelle Picard was blocked.
In the teams’ last meeting, Clarkson captured a share of the ECAC Hockey regular season title with a 1-0 win in the final game of the regular season, but the Golden Knights could not break through on Friday, likewise going 0-for-4 on the power play.

The Harvard women’s field hockey team (8-8, 3-3 Ivy) split its two games this past weekend, defeating Dartmouth (7-9, 2-4) on Saturday before falling to No. 12 Boston College (11-7, 1-5 ACC) on Sunday.
BOSTON COLLEGE 5, HARVARD 0
Harvard was shut out during its last non-conference match of the season on Sunday against Boston College. The matchup was only the second time all season in which the Crimson didn’t manage to score a goal and was the team’s second-biggest loss of the season in terms of point differential.
“We’re really disappointed and are just trying to figure out what went wrong,” Harvard co-captain Caroline Code said. “We’re just trying to think about how we can better prepare mentally next time.”
The Crimson defense limited Boston College to only one goal in the first half, but faltered in the second half as the Eagles found the back of the net four times—three of them coming within eight minutes of each other. The Eagles displayed a balanced attack, with each goal in the contest coming from a different player.
Harvard senior goalkeeper Issy Davies recorded nine saves on the matchup, but couldn’t stem the onslaught of the Eagles offense, which attempted 29 shots—with more than half of them on goal—to Harvard’s two. The Eagles also outnumbered the Crimson in penalty corners, attempting 13 on the night—again to Harvard’s two—and finding success on one of them.
“We competed with Boston College but just couldn’t pull out enough goals,” Code said. “Of course, they’re very highly ranked, but that’s something to keep working on as the program gets better.”
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 1
With about eight minutes left in the game, Crimson senior Dina Sinno launched a long pass to senior forward Elizabeth Jacobson, who was positioned right in front of the goal. In one smooth motion, Jacobson caught the pitch-perfect bullet and flicked it into the back of the net.
This senior-to-senior exchange, which capped off a dominant 4-1 victory for Harvard, capped the last home game for the Crimson. While the seniors have been crucial to the team’s success this year, Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden sees the program flourishing for many years to come.
“When you look at the team, we can rotate the freshmen in as easily as we would rotate sophomores or juniors or seniors,” van Herwaarden said. “That’s a great sign the program is in great shape.”
Jacobson in particular was crucial to Saturday afternoon’s victory against Dartmouth. Although the game was tied 1-1 after the first half, the scoreboard failed to capture the pressured produced by the Harvard offense, which attempted ten shots in the period to Dartmouth’s five.
The second half was even more lopsided, with the Crimson firing 13 shots—three of which found the back of the net—to the Big Green’s four.
Two of those second-half goals came from Jacobson, who now has 11 goals on the season and 24 for her career, good for ninth all-time among Crimson field hockey players.
“[Elizabeth] has been a leader on the field and set the tone for the team’s whole work ethic,” van Herwaarden said. “Besides the goals, she’s been a leader for the whole program.”
Along with Jacobson, junior forward Marissa Balleza is also mounting an assault on the record books. A goal on Saturday in the 48th minute put her at 12 for the season and 33 for her career, tying her for second all-time in career goals.
With the win, Harvard is now 3-3 in Ivy League play, good for fourth in the conference. The Crimson’s final matchup is next weekend against Columbia, which the team must win in order to match last season’s four conference wins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the Ivy League, one game has the ability to make or break a season. On Saturday, it took a single play to do both.
With the inside track to both an Ivy League title and a trip to the NCAA tournament up for grabs on Halloween, that play came after nearly 100 minutes of play—leaving one side on the verge of a celebration and the other wondering what just happened.
After winning a corner with under two minutes to go in the first overtime period against the Harvard men’s soccer team, Dartmouth rookie midfielder Justin Donawa lifted the ball to the middle of the box, where Crimson junior Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu rose to head the ball away.
More than a foot separated Wheeler-Omiunu from the Jordan Field turf by the end of the co-captain’s leap. But when the ball arrived, the 5’9” forward could have used a couple more inches.
Soaring over Wheeler-Omiunu, the ball instead connected with another head—that of Big Green freshman Amadu Kunateh, and the rookie delivered. Driving the ball into the right side of the net, Kunateh lifted Dartmouth to a 1-0 victory, all but sealing a second straight Ivy League championship for the Big Green.
“The guys fought hard,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “You can see when the game ends how much it means when they’re all on the ground. [That’s] leaving it out there.”
With a win, the Crimson would have tied Dartmouth atop the conference with 12 points apiece, also earning the head-to-head tiebreaker good for a trip to the Big Dance. But instead, the Big Green moves five points ahead of the rest of the pack—needing one more win to clinch the title.
“It always hurts when it’s a huge game that you build up to all year and you don’t come out with the result you want,” said senior forward Jake Freeman, fighting back tears. “But I love our guys. We have an unbelievable team as we’ve shown all year.”
Freeman, who leads Harvard with five goals—three of which have been game-winners, nearly produced a golden opportunity for the Crimson in the 67th minute. After corralling sophomore midfielder Sam Brown’s lob downfield with his chest, Freeman fought off sophomore defenseman Tyler Dowse on the left wing and entered the box.
But Dowse remained right on his hip. Upon entering the penalty area, the sophomore reached across Freeman with his left leg to push the ball in the direction of the sideline. But Dowse’s tackle instead caught Freeman by the legs, sending the senior tumbling to the ground.
Dowse raised his hands in the air, however, and the referee instructed both sides to play on. The defenseman calmly gained possession of the ball and blasted the ball back upfield to end the threat.
“I thought it was a penalty,” Freeman said. “He was diving in, and I touched it ahead—I didn’t know if he was going to swipe at it or not. I thought I was going to get to it, but when he hit me, I wasn’t trying to go down. He took me down.”
Less than two minutes after surviving the scare, Dartmouth was back on the attack after senior midfielder Alberto Gorini delivered an immaculate through-ball between two defenders to freshman attacker Noah Paravicini.
After taking a touch, Paravicini launched a shot with his right foot that senior netminder Evan Mendez swatted away with both hands. But the rookie corralled the rebound, moved to his right, and beat the goalkeeper with a low-driven shot to the opposite side of the net.
But with the ball about to roll past the outstretched hands of Mendez, junior defenseman Alex Leondis dropped to the ground to protect his goal line, clearing the ball away with his right foot to preserve the tie.
Leondis and the backline maintained their ground all night, holding the Big Green without a shot on goal in the first half and keeping opportunities to a minimum in the second.
Meanwhile, the Crimson logged the game’s first four shots, including an attempt from Freeman that skimmed the crossbar four minutes in. But the Big Green rebounded, finishing with 12 shots to Harvard’s 13, including the one that mattered most.
“[This] hurts right now, but we still have two games left, and anything can happen,” Freeman said. “You don’t know.”

A night removed from an emphatic opening rout at Dartmouth, the No. 11/11 Harvard men’s hockey team trailed the Big Green Saturday, but five different scorers allowed the Crimson to pull away, 5-2, at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Co-captains Kyle Criscuolo and Jimmy Vesey and junior Tyler Moy scored for the second time in two nights, and freshman Ryan Donato earned his first collegiate goal as Harvard (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) paced to a more gradual win over the Big Green (0-2-0, 0-2-0) than the 7-0 spectacle in Hanover the night before.
“[Dartmouth] did a good job of blocking shots and keeping us to the outside,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought at times we tried to get a little bit fancy and wanted things to be a little bit pretty, but when we did try to establish our ground game behind the net and [were] holding onto pucks and using our speed in small areas, I thought we were pretty effective.”
Dartmouth allowed just two shots on goal in the second period, but both of them beat senior goaltender Charles Grant. After Big Green coach Bob Gaudet called upon his players for an extra level of “feistiness” Friday, the visitors played a more coordinated game Saturday but yielded seven penalties to a high-powered Harvard power play.
“It’s hard to claw back when maybe your confidence level isn’t there, and I thought tonight we played the style, the identity we want to play,” Gaudet said Saturday. “We were fierce, but…it wasn’t good enough.”
After a perfect three-for-three performance on Friday, Harvard’s power play units were good for three more goals Saturday.
Vesey produced another highlight on the power play, batting a bouncing puck out of midair at the side of the crease to give Harvard a 4-2 lead at 11:02 in the second period. Junior defenseman Victor Newell also scored on a second-period power play, while Criscuolo tied the game in the first period seconds after Harvard’s first power play of the game expired.
“It’s certainly nice having Number 19 [Vesey] out there when he can make some stuff out of nothing,” Ted Donato said. “He made a tremendous hand-eye play on his goal down there, and the great part is, we feel we can be dangerous with our second [power-play unit].”
Dartmouth senior center Nick Bligh dealt the hosts their first deficit of the year with an unmarked even strength wrist shot from the right circle at 6:35 in the first period, but Criscuolo poked a knuckling puck past Dartmouth forward Brad Schierhorn and through Grant’s pads for a fluky equalizer at 12:59. Moy proceeded to take the lead for Harvard with a long wrap-around that squeezed around the right post at 16:29.
Newell extended Harvard’s lead to two at 4:10 in the second period with a rocketing left-circle shot that found the inside of the upper right post, but Dartmouth’s Corey Kalk threaded a gap between sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen’s left shoulder and the post just over a minute later to make the game 3-2.
Ryan Donato drew multiple Dartmouth penalties before recording his first collegiate goal at 12:14 in the third period. Senior linemate Colin Blackwell fed the freshman and coach’s son for a wrist shot high in the slot to cap the night’s scoring.
His father took the goal for what it was: an insurance marker in a conference game.
“I think I was more just relieved we were able to get that three-goal lead,” Ted Donato said. “But I’m happy for him, he’s working hard, and I’m sure he’s having a lot of fun.”

In another installment of Flyby’s never-ending quest to seek out the best study spots on campus, staff writers Ignacio Sabate ’18 and Eva S. Monroe ’18 ventured past the Yard to Jenny’s Cafe in the Harvard Art Museums.
Eva: The Harvard Art Museums is a beautiful space, especially the skylit atrium at the entrance. But I definitely think of it as a place to take my mom when she comes to visit, not as a study spot. However, this trip to Jenny’s Cafe may have changed my mind.
Nacho: If you’re coming for the Instagram pictures, the lighting isn’t very good. Maybe it’s just the time of day.
Eva: Very true. I also embarrassed Nacho by standing on my chair to try and get a good overhead shot. Gotta do it for the ‘gram.
Nacho: You looked basic...but it shows you’re determined to pursue the truth in journalism.

Eva: I ordered a cinnamon french toast latte and a pumpkin muffin (gotta keep it #seasonal). The barista working was a super nice guy. He asked about my day, what I was studying, and how midterms went.
Nacho: I ordered an espresso and a chocolate-hazelnut biscotti. Very friendly man. Just quote me. Wait, no, quote me: “what a sweet little man.” The was food 11/10. No complaints.
Eva: My food was also very good. Especially the pumpkin muffin. I considered ordering a second but I didn’t want the barista to judge me. Also, I’m a clumsy fool and spilled the latte all over myself, but the part of it I actually drank was delicious. Overall, I liked the Cafe. Nacho, would you come back?
Nacho: I would come back.
Eva: Me too. It seems like a chill place to get some reading done and have a snack. Plus it’s less stressful than a library, and almost feels like it’s outside of the Harvard bubble.
So, in conclusion, Jenny’s Cafe is definitely worth the visit, which is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. Come for the coffee and nice man taking your order, stay for the pretty space and chance to be surrounded by people who aren’t between the ages of 18 and 22. There's also nicely-dressed employee who will bus your table for you. But most importantly, make sure you get the perfect Instagram before you go.

It is the glue that holds together our burritos, the final topping that completes the nachos, and the thing for which we are always willing to spend an extra two dollars: guacamole. Here in Harvard Square, we are privy to ample Mexican restaurants that all offer up their own version of the avocado dip. It can be overwhelming, and, if you end up with medicore guac, it is extremely disappointing. Fear not, because we at Flyby embarked on a journey to find the best (and worst) guac of the Square.
At the bottom of the list: QdobaDon’t be fooled by their enticing window advertisements claiming that “guac should never be extra.” You pay for what you get here, people. Their guac is watery and it tastes unsalted. It is a disgrace to avocados everywhere.
The hated fourth place spot: El Jefe’s TaqueriaThis new Harvard Square addition is honestly very average. It could be attributed to the newness of the business, but their guac recipe seems to be in need of a change. Not salty enough, too chunky, and too garlic-y. Sorry, El Jefe’s, hopefully you will improve with time.
In third place: ChipotleWe’ve all been in line and heard the worker on the other side of the glass say in one breath that “guac is extra.” We accept the two dollar price raise for good reason, Chipotle’s secret recipe is salty, limey, and a little bit spicy— everything that guac is supposed to be. The downside: they only give you that little plastic container’s worth. Let’s be real, no one is satisfied by that amount of guac.
Taking home the silver: Felipe’sOn any given weekend night, the place is madness, but the guac is great. It’s salty and delicious, and it has the perfect consistency. They slather it onto their nachos generously and will even add another dollop if you bat your eyelashes.
The winner: Border CafeIt’s hard to beat Border. The guac is perfect, and what’s more, their chips are to die for (and all you can eat). The dipping implement is a key element when considering guac. Even though the other contenders are much faster options, the long wait and the sit-down venue are worth it for the guac experience.
