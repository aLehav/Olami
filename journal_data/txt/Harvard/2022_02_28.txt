After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will continue to perpetuate its legacy of racism and white supremacy as long as it retains remnants of slavery and white supremacy. One timely example is Harvard’s fight to retain ownership of the early images of enslaved Black people commissioned by racist Harvard natural scientist Louis Agassiz.
The images, rediscovered in the 1970s, were daguerreotypes, early types of photographs, commissioned in 1850 by Louis Agassiz. His request for detailed images of Black bodies for study used enslaved men and women, without their permission, to facilitate his claims that he could prove the inferiority of the Black race through scientific study. Harvard’s ownership of these images continues the legacy of white institutional ownership of Black bodies. To emancipate itself from this legacy of white supremacy, Harvard must renounce ownership of the images and give them to an African-American history museum.
Agassiz was born in Switzerland and educated in Europe before moving to the United States to work as a natural scientist and zoologist. He received a teaching position at Harvard in the 1840s where he spent much of his time creating the University’s Museum of Comparative Zoology. Agassiz’s 19th-century daguerreotypes are some of the earliest  images of enslaved men and women. According to Harvard’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Agassiz commissioned the images to study Black bodies and “used polygenism to argue that Black people were part of an inferior race.”
The photos included seven subjects: Alfred, Delia, Drana, Fassena, Jack, Jem, and Renty, all from South Carolina plantations, with stoic expressions . Each image exhibits their Blackness like specimens, placed squarely in the photo’s frame for maximum observation. Some photos show only the top half of the subjects, while others show them fully nude, standing facing forward and sideways. The photos show strong but worn-down Black people — people who have been beaten, forced to work, and humiliated. The most striking element of the photos are their eyes, which tell a story of sadness and dehumanization under slavery. However, the unethical display of these images — which were photographed for the purpose of elevating racist ideologies — only bolster the credibility of the pseudo-scientist that commissioned them.
The issue of ownership of the images gained attention after Tamara Lanier sued Harvard for the daguerreotypes, claiming to be a direct descendant of Renty. In March 2021, a Massachusetts judge dismissed Lanier’s lawsuit, arguing that the images of this type belong to the photographer and not the subject. More than 150 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, spoils of their labor and images of the enslaved still belong to the enslaver’s enabler.
The debate on the ownership of Black and Indigenous art comes as museums worldwide reckon with the movement to return stolen art to their rightful owners. Many African nations are fighting for and regaining control of their stolen artifacts, and African leaders like Chimamanda Adichie are underscoring this effort in their advocacy. She explained to German leaders at the country’s new Humboldt Forum museum that a “nation that believes in the rule of law cannot possibly be debating whether to return stolen goods. It just returns them.” So should Harvard.
The Agassiz daguerreotypes aren’t artifacts stolen from great African nations through the treachery, looting, and wealth extraction of colonialism. But they are stolen images of Black bodies taken without permission and used to perpetuate the lies of white supremacy.
For its part, Harvard released a statement about the Agassiz images calling them “powerful visual indictments of the horrific institution of slavery” and expressed the wish to make the images “more accessible to a broader segment of the public and to tell the stories of the enslaved people that they depict.” Harvard being allowed to control the usage and ownership of these images is akin to a predator retaining the ownership of revenge porn. This must change.
Harvard’s relationship with Agassiz cannot be decoupled from his adherence and mission to use the images to reinforce white supremacy. Regardless of what any court rules, Harvard must do what’s right and find a museum dedicated to African-American history and give it the daguerreotypes. The University should relinquish their interest in the images and have Black scholars at Harvard — the Black Alumni Society, Black students, and community leaders — lead the search to find these images a new home. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C., or the Museum of African American History in Boston are possibilities for a new home. There are many African American history museums around the country that could benefit from owning and sharing these images and their story with the world.
Six of the seven subjects of the images lived long enough to see emancipation in 1865. But as long as their images remain in the University’s possession, they can never be fully free. Black bodies, even in photography, deserve a home free of inequality and white supremacy. Harvard is not that home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re reading this, that means we couldn’t pull together an op-ed in time.
Don’t worry about it too much. Running out of op-eds isn’t a “scraping the bottom of the barrel” kind of situation; it’s more of a “leaky faucet slows to a drip.” It’ll fix itself in due time.
It’s not as if we don’t have op-eds — a glance at our (endearing) mess of an email inbox (quick plug: please submit your op-eds to op-eds@thecrimson.com) will reveal stacks upon stacks of recently shared Google docs, drafts that are more suggestion than text, and back-and-forth email chains. The issue is that the op-eds pipeline is a capricious mistress. Sometimes the piece you think is going to be three edits and a fact check turns into a weeks-long endeavor. Sometimes the pieces pour in faster than we can turn them around, and sometimes the op-eds inbox is a cartoon desert complete with awkwardly drifting tumbleweeds.
This year, we’re doing op-eds a little differently. That’s slightly because we’re doing staff editorials a little differently this year, letting discussions flow for longer and develop more of that classic editorial nuance, instead of rushing to get two topics down in an hour. There are three of us op-eds editors now (hi Eleanor and Jasmine), which is unprecedented. This offsets the fact that we occasionally have an empty “fifth slot” where a staff-ed would previously go, because op-eds, like glue, can plug all kinds of holes.
So we generally have the Crimson’s Editorial page under control — although some nights, we end up needing to publish a piece like this: easy to fact check, not super editing-intensive, and with a chronically online author who checks their email and resolves suggestions like a bad compulsion. But the fact that sometimes, we do have to do stuff like this, throws into question whether the Editorial publishing system is really as well-oiled as it seems.
Why do we, the Editorial Board of The Harvard Crimson, publish three pieces — generally one op-ed, one staff-ed, and one column — a day? We’ve been publishing daily for like a hundred years. I’ve heard from the voices of previous Editorial Chairs and implicit in the actions of our formidable Board of editors that we need to keep the paper running (or the “old sheet flying,” if you’re in our same Crimson club).
Does our paper run on haphazard filler editorial content? Are we just biding the time between the high seasons of stellar op-ed submissions with whatever dregs we can scramble up in the meantime? I would hope not; at the very least, that would reflect poorly on my ability to do my job.
But it is curious how we manage to keep this ship above the waves and churning out op-eds. We say we’re delivering quantity and quality both in our op-ed curation, thank you very much. If that’s true, what gives? Harvard students are incredibly opinionated, but they are also notoriously overextended. Who has the time or mental capacity to come up with an idea or perspective that’s never been published before, develop it into 650 to 850 words of thoughtful cogent writing, and undergo a grueling editing process with a potentially neurotic editor who keeps leaving comments about “dereferencing your vague pronouns” (like seriously, what’s up with them), all to effectively throw your opinion into a sea of 2,000 and counting pieces that maybe a grand total of one really close friend will ever read and text you about?
The Editorial Board, that’s who. Our internal writers are so strong, and I know because I’ve been keeping track of every single submission from them in a handy-dandy checkbox-filled spreadsheet. We are attending three hour-but-really-hour-and-a-half-long meetings a week, and submitting passionate op-eds on the issues we really care about, and overall keeping the opinion section spicy and full of hot takes.
When I turkey-shot for op-eds editor, it was because I wanted to read and polish all these sparkling thoughts hot off their writers’ minds that make up the collective voice of the Harvard community. And I am very grateful that this is something I get to do now, night after night. My utmost respect goes out to our internal writers with their hearts beating with narrative structure and their beliefs they would defend until their dying breath, toiling through four or more op-eds a semester. It’s a marvel to see the Editorial page come together every night, even if most of those nights just involve me hunched over my laptop making little changes to phrasing and word choice.
To the Harvard Crimson’s Editorial Board: I love you all a lot. But please address your edits with immense haste so we can get back to our scheduled op-ed programming tomorrow. We have to keep the paper running, after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Early last year, Harvard Law School Professor J. Mark Ramseyer published a controversial paper on Imperial Japan’s World War II practice of impressing women from occupied territories into sexual slavery. He argued that the victims of the practice — often euphemized as “comfort women”— were better understood as recruited sex workers. This paper naturally drew ire from many scholars, with critics alleging deeply inadequate research and a fundamental misunderstanding of both facts and context. Students from the Law School and College responded with outcry as well.
In response to this broad criticism, Ramseyer released another paper last month, arguing that critics failed to address its “actual topic,” which he claimed was “exclusively descriptive.” In turn, some of the original critics claimed that Ramseyer did not address many of their concerns, instead mischaracterizing their critiques so that he could deflect the major points of criticism made.
We affirm our belief that Ramseyer’s dangerous and broadly unfounded ideas must be called out for what they are and be condemned by Harvard as well as the broader academic community. Moreover, his ideas don’t deserve the prominent place in academic discourse that this back-and-forth conversation affords them. His opinions were incorrect last year, remain incorrect today, and add nothing to legitimate scholarly debate. Scholars have refuted him many times over.
As eye-catching as the academic scuffle surrounding Ramseyer might be, we must recognize that dwelling too much on it ultimately distracts from more important issues at the cost of affected victims. Not many comfort women are still alive. We don’t know how long it will be before we have no more living survivors to share their stories with us, but we do know that the clock is ticking. By focusing on Ramseyer and the larger controversy that he sparked, we are unable to move past questioning the experience of survivors, no matter what our intentions may be. There is a cost to idle pondering and intellectualization of the horrifying reality that comfort women lived through.
Last year, in addition to collectively opining on Ramseyer’s initial work, we ran several pieces on its broader implications. They represent only a fraction of the extensive, deeply worthwhile range of academic and journalistic literature on comfort women. In them, you will find valuable, heart-wrenching details on the history of the victims and the sociopolitical context they live in today. They add weight to this reality: Some survivors are still alive and pursuing a path to justice. They have not given up, and we must not give up on them either.
Ramseyer’s initial report followed a 2021 ruling by a South Korean court that ordered Japan to pay $91,800 to each of 12 former comfort women who filed suit against the Japanese government. Yet the fight for a small measure of justice has not ended, nor have comfort women always prevailed in litigation. As survivors grow fewer and farther between, every effort becomes a desperate struggle against not only the Japanese government’s attempts at historical revisionism but also time itself.
Such moments demand moral and intellectual clarity. They demand a focus of our collective attention, undistracted, on the issues most urgently at stake. In this case, they demand a clear view of the horror these women faced and the avenues left toward repairing some of that harm.
That is where scholars should focus their attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Neuroscience concentrators Nidhi Patel ’22 and Marissa G. Sumathipala ’22 were among 23 students in the United States tapped for the 2022 Gates Cambridge Scholarship, Gates Cambridge announced earlier this month.
Patel — who is joint-concentrating in Neuroscience and Government — will pursue a M.Phil in Development Studies, while Sumathipala plans to receive her Ph.D in Neuroscience through Gates Cambridge.
The Gates Cambridge Scholarship program was established in 2000 when Bill and Melinda Gates donated $210 million to the University of Cambridge. Each year, the trust pays for the full cost of postgraduate studies — which includes tuition, airfare, and a living stipend — for around 80 recipients worldwide.
Sumathipala, who is also a Churchill scholar, intends to complete a one-year M.Phil degree in clinical neuroscience through the Churchill Scholarship, and will allocate her Gates Cambridge Scholarship toward a three-year Ph.D program in clinical neuroscience.
Sumathipala said she always knew she wanted to be a scientist, and she began conducting her own experiments when she was in middle school.
“When I was 13 I started growing flies in my bedroom and did little science experiments on them and have spent most of my time ever since then working towards this goal of becoming a scientist,” Sumathipala said.
After suffering a severe concussion as a serious figure skater in high school, Sumathipala developed an interest in studying neurological diseases, which will be the focus of her research at Cambridge.
“After the concussion, I was going to doctors and none of them really had answers for why I was still having symptoms years after the concussion, and how they could help me,” Sumathipala said. “That sort of frustration about how little modern medicine had to offer to people with brain injuries and disease sparked an enduring passion for neuroscience research.”
Sumathipala will conduct research to help develop treatments for diseases like ALS and frontotemporal dementia at Cambridge’s Homerton College.
At Lucy Cavendish College, Patel will pursue a M.Phil in Development Studies exploring the neurological and political effects of witnessing violence.
Patel said her undergraduate concentration in Government and Neuroscience has fueled her interest in the interdisciplinary study of the two fields.
“I’ve been studying political science and thinking about how violence affects our identities as citizens and also just broadly, the sorts of political, social, and economic forces that shape our lives,” Patel said. “On the neuroscience end, I got really excited about experience-based brain development and how environmental influences can affect our mental health.”
Sumithipala and Patel both expressed gratitude toward their mentors at Harvard.
Sumathipala said she was especially grateful to her mentors at the McCarroll Lab for “helping [her] to grow as a neuroscientist and preparing [her] for a Ph.D.”
Patel said she attributes her success to the support of her network at Harvard.
“I definitely could not have done it without the support of just a lot of professors, mentors, teaching fellows, Elliot house community members,” Patel said. “It was really a team effort.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Todne Thomas, an associate professor at the Harvard Divinity School, examined the 2015 burning of a predominantly African American church as part of a wider discussion about the phenomenon of Black church arson at a virtual lecture Friday.
The lecture, titled “From Sacred Ground to ‘Ground Work’: Black Church Arson and Intramural Self-Representation,” was part of an anthropology speaker series hosted by the University of Notre Dame. In her lecture, Thomas outlined four possible explanations for the unsolved arson of the College-Hill Seventh-Day Adventist Church, or CHSDAC, a predominantly Black church in Knoxville, Tenn.
While three of the explanations suggest religious and social factors, such as the rise of white supremacist terrorism and gentrification, Thomas elucidated a fourth explanation — “the idea of a Black arsonist.”
Thomas recounted ethnographic interviews with residents in the area surrounding the CHSDAC, which were used to connect the cultural notion of a Black arsonist to intraracial tensions.
“I demonstrate that local speculations about a Black arsonist reference broader intraracial schisms in the Black community — that is, anti-Adventist bias, the polarization of wealth and socioeconomic class, and the presumed antipathy between Black churches and Black activists,” Thomas said.
Thomas pushed back on what she considers to be a form of “epistemic violence” — political and social narratives that overemphasize Black urban violence. She noted that her ethnographic techniques aim to prevent the perpetuation of traditional and potentially harmful narratives that leave out certain Black perspectives.
“I collect and join other narratives that explore Black community dynamics in ways that are not beholden to essentialized narratives of Black criminality, culture of poverty theses, instead guided by the ethical imperative to center Black voices and accounts of arson, and the belief that such a reframing yields new perspectives,” Thomas said.
Thomas said she initially worried her work might be appropriated by white supremacists to advance narratives that are harmful to Black people, but was encouraged by a colleague to continue the project.
“We can't be so concerned with the white gaze that we don't have the conversations we need to have as a community,” Thomas said.
Thomas concluded her lecture by expressing frustration with the treatment of Black individuals by “white social science,” which she contends fails to capture the nuance of individual experiences.
“It loves to explain and attribute. It doesn't ask enough questions. It doesn't leave irresolution — the messiness of human experience,” she said. “Black people don't get that. We get very hard, concretized meta-narratives. And we deserve more.”

Kizzmekia S. Corbett, an assistant professor of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health, was awarded the 2022 Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science from the American Association for the Advancement of Science earlier this month.
The AAAS Early Career Award for Public Engagement with Science recognizes early-career scientists and engineers who “demonstrate excellence in their contribution to public engagement with science activities,” according to its website. Corbett was awarded the honor for her work on public education surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine, particularly for people of color.
Emily T. “Rese” Cloyd, director of the AAAS Center for Public Engagement with Science and Technology, emphasized the importance of Corbett’s efforts to engage the public in her research.
“Dr. Corbett sees her research and public engagement as inextricably linked — recognizing that dialogue with people about their questions and concerns is essential to transforming a vaccine on the shelf into a vaccination in someone's arm, where it can protect them and their community from Covid-19,” Cloyd wrote in an email.
Corbett joined the School of Public Health faculty last June after completing her postdoctoral fellowship at the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center, where she led the Coronavirus Vaccines and Immunopathogenesis team, and focused on developing the mRNA vaccine technology behind the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine.
In addition to her contributions to the development of the Covid-19 vaccine, Corbett also focused her efforts on public engagement to answer questions about the vaccine for people of color, who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.
Corbett worked to encourage vaccination through both traditional news and social media, including an Instagram takeover of former First Lady Michelle Obama’s account, as well as town halls and public events.
Cloyd said the organization’s recognition of Corbett can serve as an example for how other scientists can make their work more accessible to the public.
“There are many areas of science that touch upon timely social issues - where dialogue between the scientific community and broader civic society is essential to addressing challenges like climate change, the spread of diseases like COVID-19, and the development and use of artificial intelligence,” Cloyd wrote. “By highlighting the work of Dr. Corbett, AAAS is providing a model for how other scientists can also engage with the public in conversations about these important topics.”

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus discussed the global pandemic response and health equity on Friday at the Kennedy School’s annual Robert S. McNamara Lecture on War and Peace.
Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams moderated the virtual conversation, which was jointly hosted by the Harvard Institute of Politics and the School of Public Health.
Ghebreyesus, Ethiopia’s former health minister, began his remarks by acknowledging the war in Ukraine and speaking on the positive link between peace and health.
“The authors of WHO’s constitution were well aware of the link between health and peace, which is why they wrote in the preamble that the health of all people is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security, and is dependent upon the fullest cooperation of individuals and states, ” Ghebreyesus said.
He then turned to the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the lessons learned thus far.
“Covid-19 is a powerful demonstration that a pandemic is so much more than a health crisis. It illustrates the interconnectedness between health and economy, security, education, and the intimate links between the health of humans, animals and our planet, ” Ghebreyesus said.
Ghebreyesus said scientific innovations can widen inequality unless they are paired with a commitment to equity.
“As we speak, 83 percent of the population of Africa is yet to receive a single dose of vaccine,” Ghebreyesus said. “Vaccine nationalism, export bonds and bilateral deals between manufacturers and high income nations severely restricted the number of doses COVAX was able to ship in the first half of last year.”
COVAX is an initiative that aims to accelerate the development and manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines, and to “guarantee fair and equitable for every country in the world,” according to WHO’s website. It is part of WHO’s Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator, a partnership aimed at accelerating development, production, and access to Covid-19 tests and treatments.
Ghebreyesus said the WHO is working to vaccinate countries in need, but the effort requires buy-in from countries worldwide.
“WHO and our partners are now working night and day to support countries to turn vaccines into vaccinations to reach our target of vaccinating 70 percent of the population of every country by the middle of this year,” he said.
“To reach that target, we’re calling all countries to urgently fill the ACT Accelerator’s financing gap of 16 billion US dollars to ensure equitable access to vaccines, tests, and treatments and PPE everywhere,” he added.
Ghebreyesus said that, in order to rally the world around equitable vaccination, people must see health inequity as a “shared threat.”
“Unless we vaccinate the whole world, we will all be at risk,” Ghebreyesus said. “We have to understand that this is in the best interest of everyone — every person, every nation.”
He said global vaccination requires global cooperation, and encouraged partnerships with South African biotechnology companies Afrigen and Biovac.
“If there is one country that has a significant investment in science, engineering and technology, it’s South Africa,” he said.
“I know Ghana, Senegal, Rwanda are making investments — and also Tunisia and Egypt,” he added. “I think partnering with those countries and especially academic institutions, South-South and North South, will be very, very important.”
Ghebreyesus concluded his prepared remarks with a comment on healthcare accessibility, acknowledging the recent death of Harvard physician and medical anthropologist Paul E. Farmer.
“Above all, the Covid-19 pandemic reminds us that health is not simply a luxury for the rich. It’s a fundamental human right,” Ghebreyesus said. “Paul once asked, ‘If access to healthcare is considered a human right, who is considered human enough to have that right?’ It’s that right that I, and the thousands of people I’m honored to call my colleagues, work for everyday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After learning in-person annual alumni events will be separated from Commencement for the first time this year, some Harvard alumni mourned the loss of intergenerational connections, even as many acknowledged the practical reasons behind the change.
Traditionally, the annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association took place on the afternoon of Commencement, followed by Harvard College and Radcliffe class reunions. This year, the alumni events will take place the week after Commencement, with the annual alumni meeting on June 3.
In an email to alumni class officers on Dec. 2, 2021, outgoing HAA Executive Director Phillip W. Lovejoy said the increased size of Harvard’s graduating classes and alumni reunions necessitated the change. More than 8,000 students graduate from Harvard and more than 13,000 alumni attend reunions each year, restricting most graduates to two guests, he wrote.
“Moving Reunions to the week following Commencement gives alumni priority access to campus, housing, and hotels, a critical need we’ve been hearing from reunion volunteers over the past few years,” Lovejoy wrote.
This May, Harvard will juggle two Commencement ceremonies for three graduating classes. The University is already offering on-campus housing accommodations for graduates returning for the joint Commencement for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, and also pledged to provide group rates at local hotels for graduates and their families.
Lovejoy wrote he also hopes moving the annual alumni meeting will make it “a true celebration of the alumni community.” Many long-standing traditions, such as the beloved alumni parade, will be held the week after Commencement, he added.
But some alumni worry that the move will damage intergenerational relationships at Harvard.
Margaret M. “Peggy” Padnos ’70 also mourned the loss of the combined festivities, criticizing the University for treating the tradition as “disposable.”
“There is an undeniable chain connecting the Reunion classes with those newly minted grads, whether or not anyone notices,” she wrote in an email. “That stretch of history from back then to now is there to witness, to judge, to warn, to give hope.”
Peter I. “Zik” Armstrong III ’76 acknowledged overcrowding concerns in Harvard Yard but said he is “disappointed” that he will have fewer opportunities to connect with graduating seniors and younger alumni. Armstrong said he typically visits the senior picnic to congratulate fellow students of color.
Some alumni welcomed the change, however. Joanne S. Pugh ’54 said she believes the scheduling shift will reduce costs for alumni to return to campus.
“I can’t tell you how many people wanted to come and they said, ‘It’s just too expensive, and it’s too hard to find a place,’” she said. “Anything that alleviates that is a good thing.”
Rachel V. Kemp ’79 praised the change and said she believes alumni can take measures to engage with each other.
“If we as members of the Harvard community remain relevant and build initiatives that will keep us fresh within the community — and keep us interfacing on a multi-generational basis with everyone who constitutes the community — we will be just fine,” she said.
Edward J. “Ned” Notis-McConarty ’73 — co-chair of the Committee for the Happy Observance of Commencement, an alumni group that greets guests on Commencement Day in top hats and rosettes — said he was initially shocked by the decision, but conversations with younger alumni have since allowed him to better understand the change.
“Their reaction was quite different, which was, ‘My Commencement day was chock-full of a lot of things that had nothing to do with my graduation, including meetings of alumni in the afternoon and speeches that were directed only at alumni,’” he said. “Graduation day wasn’t exactly all it could be for the actual students who are graduating.”
Ultimately, Happy Committee Co-Chair Donna Gibson ’66 said this year’s alumni festivities will be a “trial balloon.”
“We’re going to have to sit down afterwards and take a good long look at how well this went,” she said.
Former Harvard College Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote on his personal blog that decoupling Commencement from annual alumni reunions separates what he calls the “Harvard family.”
“Something essential, some piece of Harvard’s soul, is being abandoned in treating students and alumni as disjoint groups,” he wrote.
“A graduating ceremony without alumni is just an ending, not both an ending and a beginning,” Lewis added.

The Harvard Art Museums launched an initiative last fall to highlight previously “untold narratives” and promote greater representation among their exhibits.
The “ReFrame” initiative aims to bring previously unseen collections out of storage and reframe existing curations. Recent ReFrame installations include “Hyoso: The Art of Framing Japanese Paintings” and “Picturing the Lives of Women,” which highlights the struggles and achievements of women in China and around the world.
Soyoung Lee, chief curator at the Harvard Art Museums, said the idea for the initiative came from Makeda D. Best, curator of photography and interim head of the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art at the museums. Lee said she and her staff evaluated opportunities for new portrayals of their collections.
“Each curator really went back to the collections that they know best and thought about, ‘What are some of the works that are not currently on view, that merit being highlighted, because of the potential for stories that they tell?’” she said. “‘What’s currently on view that we need to examine from a different perspective?’”
Lee said she hopes the “intimate experiences” of the galleries will pique visitor interest.
“Like many museums, we are also thinking through and really thinking about presenting different ways to expand a visitor’s understanding of different artists, cultures, periods, and so forth,” she said.
The staff at the museums encountered difficulties in implementing the project, according to Lee.
“Initially, we thought it might be something of a three to five-year project that could potentially lead to a holistic kind of changes to all of our galleries,” she said. “We're still figuring out whether that’s feasible, in part because the logistics of wholescale changes to the entire museum is really, in some ways, unreal.”
“It's hard to put in place when you're operating at the same time,” she added.
The museums also faced challenges related to the Covid-19 pandemic, per Lee. The Harvard Art Museums closed abruptly in March 2020 and only reopened in September 2021.
“It’s extremely hard to actually plan and implement gallery changes when you’re not only closed, but because of the University’s guidance, much of our staff couldn’t be on site to do that work — to go into storage, bring out the art, gather around and talk about it, and also invite our students, faculty, and audience to speak with us,” she said.
In the long run, Lee said she hopes the initiative will help the museums diversify its galleries.
“Ultimately, ReFrame starting out as interventions, we think might be a three to five-year project or initiative, and help us in the long-term goal of making substantial changes in most of our galleries, in rethinking, actually, all of our galleries,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
El Jefe’s Taqueria, a staple of Harvard Square, is set to move into a new location around the corner from its current storefront in August.
The restaurant, one of the Square’s most popular late-night eateries, will join a planned Starbucks, a comedy club, and a gym in The Abbot building, a historic site located at the intersection of Brattle Street and John F. Kennedy Street. The building, which formerly housed the famous Curious George Store, has been under renovation since 2019.
The Garage, where El Jefe’s is currently located, is scheduled to undergo major renovations of its own in the coming months.
El Jefe’s owner John F. Schall said he anticipates starting construction by the end of March. He hopes to transition from one location to the other without significant disruption to restaurant operations.
“We’re going to close that space around 4 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 7,” he said. “There’s going to be a mariachi band that parades my staff from 83 Mount Auburn St. around the corner to the new space at The Abbot building. And then at 7 o'clock that night, we're going to have a big, kick-ass party.”
El Jefe’s currently operates six storefronts, having continued expansion throughout the pandemic. The restaurant intends to open two new branches in the upcoming year.
“We've never been able to really celebrate each of these new stores,” Schall said. “This is going to be a celebration not just for the new Harvard Square store, but of what El Jefe’s has been able to do in the last two years.”
The Abbot is being renovated by real estate company Regency Centers, Shawmut Design and Construction, and architecture firm Prellwitz Chilinski Associates. The renovation of the historic building aims to achieve a top environmental distinction — Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver certification — according to a press release.
“The project team has worked closely with the community, planning department, and Historical Commission to achieve a design and plan that is both elegant and responsive to the current needs of tenants while preserving the buildings’ rich history,” the press release said.
“It couldn't be a more perfect location for El Jefe’s,” Schall said. “We are essentially in the space in The Abbott building that was occupied by the first floor of Urban Outfitters before they did the renovations to that building. So we'll have an entrance both on Brattle Street and on JFK Street.”
The new location also offers the restaurant increase in floor space.
“It's almost twice as much square footage as our existing location,” Schall said. “We'll have a double line there. You'll be able to go into the middle where the tortilla presses are to start, and then you can go in either direction, so there will be at least twice the seating capacity.”
Schall said the new location will help El Jefe’s to be able to serve more customers.
“Right now, we're absolutely capacity constrained,” he said. “We lose, you know, 50 to 100 people a night that just don't wait because from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., the line’s too long.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last weekend before the ECAC playoffs begin, the Harvard Men’s Hockey team was on the road for a back-to-back-to-back set against conference opponents to close out the regular season. All three were games that were rescheduled, having been originally postponed due to Covid-19 in January.
The Crimson jumped around the northeast on the road trip, first taking on the Union College Dutchmen in Schenectady, N.Y. on Friday night, then heading to Troy, N.Y. to face the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Engineers on Saturday night, before wrapping up the regular season in Princeton, N.J. against the Princeton Tigers on Sunday afternoon.
Harvard went 2-1 on the weekend, losing to Union 5-3, beating RPI 5-1, and defeating Princeton 3-0. The Crimson finished the regular season with a 17-9-3 record, good for third in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC).
“We wanted to try to manage the energy level as much as possible with the three games and the travel,” head coach Ted Donato said. “We know that as we get down to the end of the season here, if we’re able to have some success, we’re gonna need to have confidence in guys coming in and out of the lineup.”
The Crimson played the three games without sophomore forward Sean Farrell, who remains out with an upper-body injury. However, there is optimism that Farrell, who played for the United States national team during the 2022 Beijing Olympics, will be ready to return when the team opens the ECAC playoffs on March 11, according to Donato.
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
Before returning back to campus, Harvard concluded its season in Princeton, N.J. The Crimson scored a goal in each period, shutting out its Ivy League rival 3-0.
Throughout the game, possession was dominated by Harvard; however, it only outshot their opponents by three, 33 to 29. Senior forward Jack Donato opened up the scoring, assisted by junior forward Baker Shore and junior defenseman Henry Thrun, just over eight minutes into the contest.
Play stayed consistently aggressive, escalating in roughness in the second. Players from both sides allowed frustration to boil over – in the second period alone, seven different players were called for penalties. The Crimson was forced to the penalty kill four times while having two power play opportunities of its own.
The first two penalties came from hooking by first-year defenseman Jack Bar and a tripping call on junior defenseman Ryan Siedem, respectively. Harvard was able to diffuse the disadvantages, as Thrun, Jack Donato, and junior goaltender Mitchell Gibson came up with big plays on the penalty kill.
“Playoff hockey is just a different animal, and two major components of that are that you gotta be good on special teams and you’ve gotta have a hot goaltender,” Thrun said.
The Crimson failed to convert its first power play of the second, and just over ten seconds after the advantage was over, found itself down a man again, with first-year forward Alex Gaffney being sent to the box for hooking with 4:30 remaining. After again preventing the Tigers from finding the twine, the man-up advantage flipped in Harvard’s favor, and this time they were able to successfully execute. Sophomore forward Alex Laferriere scored with just over two minutes remaining in  the second, assisted by junior forward and captain Nick Abruzzese and first-year defenseman Ian Moore.
The Crimson maintained its aggression into the third period, as it started off a man down with the continuation of first-year forward Matthew Coronato’s roughing penalty from the end of the second. Its defensive domination continued as well, as Harvard was able to prevent a goal. Desperate for an extra offensive skater, Princeton pulled its goalie early, with about 4:30 remaining. This allowed senior defenseman Marshall Rifai to drill an unassisted open-netter, solidifying the 3-0 win.
The three-goal lead inclined Ted Donato to pull starter Gibson from the game with 2:32 left, giving senior goaltender Derek Schaedig the chance to finish out his last regular season game between the posts. Schaedig recorded one save.
“The guys were really battling for him to make sure he closed the game off,” Jack Donato said of Schaedig. “It’s a good message for the younger guys that maybe aren’t playing as much that you could get those moments whenever your number is called.”
HARVARD 5, RPI 1
After dropping a close 2-0 decision to the Engineers on January 25th at home, the Crimson earned its redemption, coming out flying after the puck drop to put the game to bed shortly after the first intermission.
Coronato opened the scoring eight minutes into the game on an odd-man rush. After breaking through the neutral zone to create a two-on-one, Coronato dragged the puck around the sliding RPI defenseman and fired a wrist shot past goaltender Linden Marshall to give Harvard the 1-0 lead.
Two minutes later, Laferriere and Thrun created another rush opportunity, and Laferriere’s slick pass found a streaking Thrun, who made a quick move and roofed the puck over Marshall’s shoulder to extend the Crimson lead to 2-0.
The momentum wouldn’t stop there, as four minutes later, on another rush chance, first-year forward Zakary Karpa strode down the left wing and ripped a wrist shot past Marshall, extending the Harvard lead to 3-0.
“We know with RPI, they sometimes fall into a one-three-one, which is a more passive neutral zone,” said Thrun, regarding the team’s rush offense. “We were aware of it and we kinda knew what was coming at us.”
Towards the end of the period, on a power play created by Siedem’s strong stickhandling, Laferriere made a perfect cross ice pass to Abruzzese, who hammered a one-time slap shot from the faceoff circle past Marshall, stretching the Crimson lead to 4-0. With the four-goal first period, Harvard recorded its best start to a game since a five-goal first period against Bentley on Oct. 30.
“Coach always talks about starting the game on time and not having to chase the game,” Thrun said. “You run into a lot of hot goalies late in the season here so it's important to get off to good starts.”
The Crimson carried its strong start into the second period, as only five minutes into the second frame, Thrun scored his second goal of the game, this time on the power play. Karpa’s hard shot from the slot rebounded out wide to the circle, where Thrun found the puck and hammered it past Linden, who could not slide across the crease in time. With the goal, Thrun recorded his first career multi-goal game and extended the Harvard lead to 5-0.
The Crimson remained stout on defense despite possessing a five-goal lead, as sophomore goaltender Derek Mullahy, playing for the first time in nearly two weeks, was solid in the net. Engineers’ forward Ture Linden was able to break up the shutout bid with a goal early in the third period, but Mullahy and a strong defensive effort were able to lock down from there, preserving a 5-1 victory.
“We were really able to spread the minutes out,” Ted Donato said. “We didn’t have anyone that was forced into playing huge minutes upfront.”
UNION 5, HARVARD 3
The Crimson hoped to start the weekend off strong against Union, having beaten the Dutchmen 4-1 earlier this season. However, after giving up a goal within the first ten minutes of the game, Harvard found itself playing a game of catch-up.
Gaffney evened the score later in the first, assisted by Siedem and Coronato. After giving up a power-play goal in the second period, as Bar was in the box for cross-checking, Coronato tied the score again within the first thirty seconds of the third. He was assisted by Abruzzesse and Karpa.
However, Union responded quickly, notching two goals within two minutes of each other, putting the Dutchmen up 4-2. By this point, there was about 13 minutes remaining; however, gameplay was far from over. Both teams remained aggressive offensively, putting shots on goal, and Harvard’s Shore tipped in a pass by Siedem, pulling the Crimson within one.
Harvard continued to create offensive opportunities late in the game, hoping to get to overtime. Ted Donato pulled Gibson with 1:15 remaining, for an extra offensive skater. However, Union intercepted the Crimson’s possession and scored on the empty net, solidifying its win.
Having wrapped up the regular season this weekend, Harvard will enjoy a bye week next weekend before hosting an ECAC quarterfinal best-of-three series starting March 11.
“The last month, we've established an identity that we know can win hockey games for us,” Jack Donato said. “Every game we play from here on out is playoff hockey.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After splitting the first two games of the series, a Game 3 winner-take-all matchup was scheduled for Feb. 27 at Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Both No. 6/6 Harvard (22-9-1, 16-5-1 ECAC) and Princeton (13-14-5, 9-10-3 ECAC) knew that a victory would be critical to their NCAA hopes.
The Tigers took game one 4-2 after a third period surge. However, the Crimson would bounce back with a 2-1 overtime victory in the second game to force the decisive battle. Ultimately, Princeton rode to a 3-2 victory in Game 3 behind the strength of goalie Rachel McQuigge and her 38 saves.
“Hats off to their goaltender. She had a heck of a weekend,” said Harvard head coach Katey Stone.
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 3
For the only time in the series, the Crimson struck first in Game Three. After junior forward Kristin Della Rovere threaded the needle with a perfect pass, senior forward Becca Gilmore converted the one-on-one situation and beat McQuigge to give Harvard the 1-0 edge.
Princeton tied the game up four minutes later, however, when Sharon Frankel’s shot connected following a flurry of shots from the Tigers’ offense. The score remained unchanged in the second as Harvard failed to convert on an early power play opportunity. Another chance to recapture the lead would come and go for the Crimson as Gilmore couldn’t convert on her second one-on-one opportunity midway through the second.
Princeton pulled out to a two-goal lead in the third off of goals from forwards Maggie Connors and Shannon Griffin. With two minutes remaining, Harvard appeared to muster more late game heroics after senior forward Keely Moy looked to have found the back of the net. However, the goal would be reviewed and overturned due to goalie interference. Junior forward Anne Bloomer later scored a goal from behind the end line in the final minutes, but the clock ultimately ran out on the Crimson.
After the game, Stone pinpointed Princeton’s defense as a key factor in the outcome of the game.
“They were pretty stingy about giving us second and third chance opportunities,” she said.
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 1 (OT)
The defenses of both Harvard and Princeton shined in the first period of Game Two, as the teams managed to combine for just 13 shots on goal. Each team was also successful on the penalty kill in the opening frame. Throughout the period, the Crimson continued to play with  intensity and build momentum. With each shot on goal and save, the Harvard bench would erupt and give life to the crowd of 275 in Bright-Landry.
Princeton forward Grace Kuipers finally got the scoring going four minutes into the second. In the next few minutes, the Crimson dominated possession, but was unable to convert on its many quality chances. After Harvard successfully defended the power play for the second time, the Tigers ultimately entered the third with a one-goal lead.
The Crimson capitalized on its quality chances one minute into the third period, after sophomore Shannon Hollands emerged from a scramble with the puck and fired it into the cage. Although neither team would score for the rest of the third, each unit had its chances. At the five minute mark, Harvard went on the power play after Princeton was called for checking. The Tigers also created good opportunities to score after a communication error for the Crimson led to it playing down a player for 15 seconds. Junior goaltender Lindsay Reed also made a key save around the 15-minute mark to send it to overtime.
Needing a win to force a decisive Game 3, the message in the locker room before overtime was straightforward.
“We just talked about keeping the energy high,” Della Rovere said. “Our mindset was to keep pushing and we knew we were going to win.”
The Caledon East, Ont. native wasted no time making good on her promise after the overtime puck drop. After winning the opening faceoff, she took a pass from Bloomer and guided the puck through traffic to score the game winner. The goal was also her 100th career point, making her just the 26th member of the 100 point club for Harvard.
“It’s a real honor,” Della Rovere said. “It is a milestone for everyone, not just myself”.
HARVARD 2, PRINCETON 4
Six minutes into the game, Princeton scored the first goal of the weekend when Connors swung a pass left to forward Annie Kuehl, who proceeded to hook it into the back of the cage. The Crimson then went on the power play seven minutes later due to a tripping call against the Tigers, but Princeton’s power play unit held strong. However, the Crimson would tie up the game late in the first period off of a goal from senior forward Brooke Jovanovich. Jovanovich found the net after gaining possession from a tie up along the boards. The goal was the third in as many games against Princeton for Jovanovich.
The second period followed much the same script as the first. Three minutes into the second frame, the Tigers regained the lead when Frankel pushed the puck across the line after several saves from Reed. Nine minutes later, Princeton got an opportunity to expand its lead as it went on the power play. However, Harvard killed off the penalty. The Crimson found its equalizer in the final minute of the frame, as senior defender Kate Glover brought the puck up the ice and guided it in.
Early in the third, the Tigers pulled ahead again thanks to a goal from Griffin. However, the goal came with controversy, and was only allowed following a lengthy review from the officials. Princeton’s lead grew to two after another goal from Griffin 15 minutes into the third. Harvard got one final chance at a comeback after a minor penalty was assessed to the Tigers in the final two minutes, but Princeton was able to fight off the power play and hold on for the victory.
After dropping the first match, Coach Stone believed that her team could improve their speed. She also emphasized a more physical approach to the next game.
“We can move the puck faster, we can get on pucks faster,” she said. “[We can] put a body on them to slow them down.”
Game One also featured Moy’s return to the lineup following her stint representing Switzerland at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Entering the game, she had not played since the Jan. 21 matchup, also against the Tigers.
Despite entering the weekend fifth in the nation in power play percentage, the Crimson failed to generate a power play goal in the series.
“The best penalty kill starts with the goaltender,” Stone said. “Their goalie gave them what they needed on their PK”.
Now, Harvard’s fate rests in the hands of the selection committee. The Crimson’s resume features quality accomplishments like the Ivy League title, Beanpot Championship, and ECAC regular season championship; however, it also features only one out-of-conference win against a ranked opponent.
Currently, Harvard ranks ninth in the PairWise rankings. In the past, this would leave the Crimson on the outside looking in. However, the NCAA decided to expand the tournament from eight to eleven teams starting this season. The bracket is revealed for the 2022 NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament on Sunday, March 6.

Dear Boston and your terrible winter weather (and to the airline that caused my misery which I would totally namedrop if I could),
All I needed from my weekend trip to New York was to make it to my silly little orthodontist appointment to fix my silly little crossbite that resulted from my silly little retainer that didn’t fit my silly little teeth. I promised I was going to come right back, but I guess you just couldn’t bear to see me leave because you made me stay at the airport for ten horrendous hours until you eventually canceled my flight. And I totally get it, you might say, “Annette, you should have known better! Harvard Today told you that it was going to snow the day you were supposed to leave.” That’s a really great point, but what was I supposed to do?? My airline didn’t cancel my flight and I’m a broke college student who didn’t buy insurance for her tickets and didn’t want to pay a fee to move them to another day, okay??
So, I braved your snow and took the T and the airport shuttle (alone for the first time), made it to the Boston Logan International Airport, and got through TSA. I was waiting patiently for my flight to take off when the nice flight attendant announced that there were small delays but that we would be taking off shortly. That was a BIG FAT LIE but I didn’t know it at the time. Naively, I went about my life FaceTiming friends and trying to get through some lecture slides.
After about an hour of waiting, the announcement came that changed the course of my evening, night, and early morning. Apparently, there had been a small little detail that the airline had failed to mention before which was the fact that WE DIDN’T HAVE A PILOT. So, you might be wondering, “What’s that gotta do with me?” Well, you see, the pilot was supposed to have flown from New York to Boston, but since it wouldn’t stop snow storming, the poor man was stuck in New York. I hope by now, you feel just a tiny bit of sympathy. Unfortunately, this was just the beginning of my struggle.
At this point, I’m panicking a little bit but trying to keep calm. I’m sitting by myself not knowing what to do when I see a group of people go up to the flight attendant to ask if they could change their flight. Normally, this is something that I would never, ever do because advocating for myself gives me ~anxiety~ but I figured it was time to put on my big girl pants. I went up to the flight attendant and she told me that I needed to go to the “Just Ask” desk if I wanted to change my flight. I did as I was told and waited half an hour on a line (which was a recurring theme of the night). When it was finally my turn to speak with a customer service worker, I was faced with my worst nightmare: making decisions.
TL;DR: there were two flights that were going to New York around the same time. One flight had no pilot and the other flight’s plane was frozen. Since I am indecisive, I let the nice worker (who was avoiding giving me definitive advice, probably so she wouldn't get sued or something) to choose for me. She hesitantly suggested that I go with the frozen plane because they said they could fix it soon. In hindsight, this was a HUGE MISTAKE.
At the time though, I was so proud of myself for taking initiative and ~adulting~ to the max! Again, I was totally wrong. It took hours for the maintenance trucks to come and start spraying steam at the plane. At this point, everyone at the airport was getting pissed, but the airline kept insisting that we would be taking off at some point that night. You would think we would all give up and leave at this point but I guess everyone, myself included, passionately wanted to leave Boston (because why wouldn’t we).
The next thing we knew, the airline was telling us that the flight had been canceled due to the maintenance issue that they said they would fix. So what did they do? They moved us back to the flight with no captain because apparently, now there is a captain! Crazy right? Well it gets even crazier.
I ended up boarding the plan. We were told the plane just needed to be defrosted for 15 minutes and then we would be taking off (neither of which ended up happening, FYI). Nonetheless, we all sat there in the musty plane for a good two hours until the captain hit us with the devastating news that the flight had not been canceled yet (what does that even mean???) but it will be (again, what does that even mean????). Our only “options” were to either go get refunds or stay on the plane until the flight was canceled. What really was the cherry on top of the whole fiasco was overhearing some guy proudly telling his girlfriend,“Babe, they just want us to refund our tickets so we can’t sue. We have to stay on the plane” (cue the eye roll).
At this point, it was well past 2 a.m. and I was so sick and tired of the airport that I ran up to the front desk and waited another half hour to ask for a refund. I gave up ever leaving Boston at this point. With whatever sanity I had left, I hailed an Uber and went back to my dorm. So, Boston: abcdefu and your airport and the airline and your snow and your broken down planes that I wish I could never see again but had to because the first thing I did the following morning was booked another ticket to New York (through another airline) and left.
Sincerely,
Annette Kim
