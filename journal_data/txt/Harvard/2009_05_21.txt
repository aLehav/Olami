After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the biggest casualties in the War on Terror has been America’s international reputation. Five years ago, we began to learn of the horrific treatment meted out to the prisoners in what was then known as the Abu Ghraib prison, just outside of Baghdad. While the accounts and descriptions of this abuse were chilling enough, what really pricked Americans’ collective conscience was the release of a series of photographs that documented (in grisly detail) the full extent of the physical and mental pain inflicted on these inmates.This legacy is precisely why we find President Obama’s recent decision to block the release of more detainee abuse photographs—which span a total of five years’ worth of images and depict a series of extreme interrogation techniques classified as torture, including waterboarding—to be extremely disappointing. Last month, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs announced that the Obama administration planned to release the photographs, citing a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. But, on May 13, the administration changed its mind. The White House’s sudden reversal is not only unfortunate but also makes it complicit in what is effectively one of the greatest governmental cover-ups in contemporary history.The Obama administration attempts to justify its new stance with an appeal to national security: Secretary of Defense Robert Gates argued that the release of the photographs would stir up trouble in Afghanistan and Iraq and lead to an increase in American casualties in both theaters. We find the connection between the release of photographs and the security of our troops dubious and are more concerned that Gates’s appeal to vague threats to “national security” is a return to the policies of the past.Ever since the release of the Pentagon Papers, which detailed America’s extensive involvement in the Vietnam War, including the controversial decision to bomb then-neutral Cambodia and Laos, the American people have learned the hard way that there is often a massive credibility gap between what Washington tells them and the realities on the ground. The Bush administration’s refusal to be honest about what happened at Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib not only hurt its credibility at home but also inspired much hatred, indignity, and anti-Americanism abroad. If the Obama administration follows in its footsteps, it will only find itself complicit in the opaque policies of the Bush era.While it is unfortunate that incidents like the ones depicted in the latest set of photographs occurred, we do not want to have a government that systematically suppresses the release of information that could damage its political standing. We believe that the release of the photographs would allow the American people to document the abuse of detainees and create a system in which future mistakes could be prevented. As such, we are extremely disappointed in the Obama administration’s change of heart and hope that this does not mark a turn away from its heretofore transparent and praiseworthy decisions regarding the treatment of prisoners.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is, I think, occasionally important to ask yourself that odd question: “What the hell am I doing here?” It is perhaps easier, though no less important, to ask this question right as you are about to leave (and Harvard will kick us out with very little ceremony on June 5, following the exaggerated ceremonialism of the preceding two days of graduation). Why did I choose my concentration? Why did I choose my thesis topic? Why am I going to graduate school? What is the value of an education at all?To an urban liberal like me, the word “value” can have some suspicious connotations. It brings to mind the “values voters” of the last two or three presidential elections, in which “values” seemed a stand-in for an unexamined and potentially bigoted moral rubric—an ethical compass calibrated not by reason or argument but by a seat-of-the-pants, bottom-of-the-gut, irrational “feeling” about what is right. Or, in the completely opposite direction, the word “value” could also connote the equally unappealing hyper-rationality of modern economics, with its theories of value-added or real and nominal value.But, as I think about why I am here, I somehow find myself returning to the ideas of value and values. Perhaps what is important about education is, first, to develop and articulate for myself a set of values—whether about social justice or civic participation, art or scholarship—and, second, to learn to produce objects that I believe have value in themselves. The first could be called the ethical and aesthetic side of the word “value,” and the second could be called the productive or material side.Since one thing I’ve learned at Harvard is that etymology will improve almost any argument (or at least extend its length), let me begin with a brief history of the word. “Value” started from the Latin valere, passing through Old French before landing with a messy splash in English. An odd cluster of meanings branched from its two short syllables: it meant to be healthy, to be able, or to be worthy; when used to describe words, it also meant to be meaningful or to be significant. Somewhere along the way, the word evolved from describing a state of being to describing a more active means of direct evaluation.This idea of articulating “values” sounds slightly stodgy and conservative, but Harvard has long considered it an essential part of the liberal arts education, requiring that every student take a course in “Moral Reasoning.” According to the course catalog, the aim of Moral Reasoning is to “discuss significant and recurrent questions of choice and value that arise in human experience”; one can satisfy this requirement with courses ranging from Mansfield’s Machiavelli to John Rawls and Catherine MacKinnon (as I did). My Moral Reasoning core—offered in the philosophy department—was on equality, democracy, and distributive justice, and it became one of those rare courses that changed not only what I know but also how I think. It did as much for me as anything in helping define how I approach social and political issues and teaching me how to articulate my values.Existing alongside the ethical mode of evaluation is the aesthetic mode. Aesthetics are value judgments about the world, about its beauty, its form, its order. There is a simple pleasure in pure appreciation without any justification—what Susan Sontag called the “erotics of art” in her “Against Interpretation”—but this too is part of the cloud of values and its modes of looking and observation.The flip side of the coin from the act of evaluation, however, is the act of creation. Producing things of value is just as important as evaluating things that already exist. How do you make something that you think has value? How do you give an object worth, meaning, significance? Some people learn to create monetary value (of varying degrees of reality or imaginariness—like all those recent graduates blowing hot air into the ballooning moneybags of Wall Street in the earlier part of this decade), others create social value with nonprofit work, others create artistic value through films, plays, and articles. All of these are means of learning to create something well, whether it is a piece of historical writing or a ceramic bowl or a mathematical theorem.Harvard doesn’t try to teach us to be happy (see “What Makes Us Happy” in June’s “Atlantic”), but it does give students the tools to learn, grow, and articulate their values and then to craft projects and products they believe have value. Perhaps these values are occasionally skewed, but it is part of the process of teaching us not just how to know things, but how to think and how to create.And now, the final meaning of the Latin valere: valeo iubere, I bid you farewell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, May 11, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences outlined a wide-ranging set of changes to programs and services across all parts of FAS. It launched a website to share those changes and provide contacts for questions or more information. The website will be the portal for the reporting of further progress and the collecting of broad community input. These recently announced changes to programs and services were the result of a cost-saving effort involving all units of FAS, launched as we began the process of budgeting for fiscal year 2010.As was publicized and explained, our efforts to trim the FAS budget focused on local planning and efficiency-increasing measures, and it asked the community for ideas. It produced an extensive set of suggestions, and the academic deans of FAS approved those that made better use of our limited resources within the context of our core mission. The approved list equates to a $77 million reduction in our annual operating budget but represents only 35 percent of the $220 million deficit that FAS will face in two short years (based on what we know today).The remaining $143 million must be the focus of our community. We will not meet this goal by simply making further reductions in our existing programs. As we have often heard, the current reductions left no “fat” in our programs, and to continue to squeeze them would simply “cut into bone.” We must look at each major area of the FAS and decide what excellence for the future will look like, within a budget driven by our new fiscal reality. Only then can we decide where to make further reductions and where to apply incremental resources. As you have heard us say, this approach will most likely involve the restructuring or reshaping of some of our academic programs. Change is difficult, even when the goal is clear, and to successfully overcome the challenge before us, our entire community—the faculty, staff, and students—will need to work together and trust that each has the best in mind for our community.The global economic crisis is having powerful impacts on higher education, and neither Harvard nor its peers have been immune. Difficult trade-offs among many traditional commitments have been and will continue to be made. We can promise you that the decisions we make will always reflect our core values, priorities, and mission. While the spotlight of attention will often be pulled toward that which has been eliminated, we would also like to acknowledge those of you in the community who have indicated to us that you understand that behind every measure announced there is a trade-off. And we hope that this entire process reflects our dedication to the excellence of our programs and, to the greatest degree possible, our effort to minimize its impact on all those who make FAS the unique and vibrant place it is today. Can we reshape the FAS to ensure the quality, integrity, and excellence of our mission? Our answer is unequivocally yes. Will this be difficult? We all know the answer is yes. Inevitably, in such a process there will be disagreements and disappointments. Some commitments will be deemed more essential than others, and some activities will be continued while others will regrettably be eliminated. With such a multiplicity of important and valuable activities, it is never simple or easy to choose among them. But drawing upon the remarkable talents, goodwill, and broadly shared commitment of our community will sustain Harvard’s unique identity and unmatched excellence.Michael D. Smith is the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Evelynn M. Hammonds is the Dean of Harvard College. Allan M. Brandt is the Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University is a nonprofit, not a business. This is one of the central arguments that we hear professors, politicians, and students make when they advocate for Harvard to be more socially and morally responsible. But does this claim mean anything? Should Harvard act any different as a nonprofit than as a business? The answer is yes—Harvard gains huge financial benefits as a nonprofit, and with these benefits come additional responsibilities toward the community that businesses do not always have.The key difference concerns taxes. As a nonprofit, Harvard receives tax exemptions, deductions, and privileges that for-profit institutions must forgo. For example, besides innovative investing techniques, Harvard was able to build its endowment from $4.7 billion in 1990 to $37 billion in 2008 because it did not pay taxes on those gains. Relative to businesses, the federal government is subsidizing Harvard’s investment fund.In addition, Harvard does not pay real-estate taxes. Instead, it makes voluntary payments in lieu of taxes. Last year, for all of Harvard’s property, it paid $1.9 million in lieu of taxes to the City of Boston. Boston officials estimate these payments would be 10 times as large if Harvard paid real-estate taxes. Partly due to these reduced expenses, Harvard currently owns over 923,000 square feet of property in Allston that are neither developed for Harvard’s purposes nor leased to Allston businesses. Harvard would be less likely to hold these land lots for long-term construction projects if it had to pay real-estate taxes on them.As a nonprofit, Harvard also benefits from tax-deductible donations and a significant amount of federal grant money. Last year, Harvard received $651 million in donations. If donations to Harvard were not tax-deductible, this number would be a small fraction of this total. According to Harvard’s Office of Government, Community, and Public Affairs, Harvard received $535 million in federal grants in fiscal year 2008 that accounted for 82 percent of Harvard’s research revenue. Under the federal stimulus package, federal grants to Harvard are expected to increase considerably. Non-federally funded research is made possible through tax deductions on donations made by corporations and foundations.We argue that these benefits bring added responsibility. If Harvard is to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes each year and economically dominate the communities of Cambridge and Allston, it must support these stakeholders as best it can in times of economic uncertainty. Kevin Casey, Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations, has credited the university as one of the “stable bedrock institutions” that have helped guard the Boston area from the worst of the economic crisis. However, we remain unconvinced that this bedrock provides sufficient support for our community’s most vulnerable members. Although still valuable, student-run programs in the Phillips Brooks House and screenings this summer of “Finding Nemo” for local residents are not the solution to unemployment.We argue that these benefits bring added responsibility besides just educating students and providing research, as there are plenty of for-profit institutions that fulfill these roles. In the midst of a recession, Harvard is in a better position than almost any other large institution to support the local community and national economy through providing fair and stable jobs. If Harvard thought it worthwhile to create these jobs, then it has the responsibility to keep them when Cambridge, Allston, and America need them the most. If Harvard continues to benefit from taxpayers and local community members, it must meaningfully and equitably include these members as stakeholders in its budgetary decisions.The effects of cutting jobs are compounding and far-reaching. The low-wage jobs that have already been terminated once belonged to valuable members of our community, who obtain their health insurance and continuing education as benefits of working at Harvard. Having lost their employment, these people are now not only without income but also forced to enlist themselves and their families among the ranks of the uninsured and undereducated. The fact that many of these jobs belonged to the poor, marginalized, and mostly immigrant part of our community means that their unemployment will further contribute to the isolation and depression of many of our Boston- area neighborhoods. This is no strategy for times of economic hardship, and it runs contrary to Harvard’s contract with its community to provide education and opportunity to its surroundings in return for tax exemption.Massachusetts legislators and Smith economics professor James Miller have advocated for taxes on large universities. The current proposal calls for a 2.5- percent tax on university assets valued at over $1 billion. If the state of Washington taxes Microsoft, they argue, why should Massachusetts not tax Harvard? The answer is that we do not want Harvard to act exactly like a business, so we should not treat it like one. We expect Harvard to think of Cambridge and Allston residents and Harvard workers even in times of stress, and the tax breaks are to help Harvard meet those expectations. If they are not met, then Harvard’s status as a nonprofit needs to be reconsidered.Laura M. Binger is a JD candidate at Harvard Law School. John F.
