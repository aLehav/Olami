After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is in talks with Ponca tribal leaders and a descendant of Ponca chief Standing Bear to repatriate to the Ponca people a pipe tomahawk that once belonged to Standing Bear, Museum Director Jane Pickering said in an interview on Thursday.
The move comes as the calls for the museum to return the tomahawk to the Ponca Tribes of Oklahoma and Nebraska have garnered media and legislative attention. Brett A. Chapman, an Oklahoma attorney and lineal descendant of Standing Bear, said he has been tweeting about the tomahawk for several years. He wrote to Pickering to officially request its return in April after receiving the support of Nebraska State Sen. Tom R. Brewer, a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe and the state’s first Native American state senator.
After initially not receiving a response for a week, he tweeted about the request, garnering international media attention. On May 7, a resolution sponsored by Brewer calling on Harvard to “fulfill its commitment to repatriation of Native American objects” — Chief Standing Bear’s tomahawk, in particular — was read on the floor of the Nebraska State Legislature, where it received bipartisan co-sponsorship.
Pickering said in the interview Thursday that the Peabody is “invested in the tomahawk going back to Oklahoma or Nebraska, back to the Ponca community.”
“Chief Standing Bear is obviously such an important figure in American history for all of us, but particularly for the Ponca community, that it just feels that it’s the right thing to do,” she said. Standing Bear was at the center of an 1879 landmark federal case in which Native Americans were for the first time ruled to be legally defined as people.
Larry D. Wright, the chairman of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska, said in an interview that he looks forward to working with Harvard and the Peabody Museum on a “resolution that would return this to the Ponca people.”
“While we appreciate the museum's mission and efforts, those items we feel are best repatriated back to the Ponca for what they represent, who they belonged to originally, and what that history means to us,” Wright said.
Brewer said his office contacted Chapman after reading an article about Chapman’s attempts to have the tomahawk repatriated. Chapman is an enrolled member of Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma who has Ponca heritage and whose great-great-great-grandfather and Standing Bear shared a grandparent.
The tomahawk “would be something that would be treasured, whether it was allowed to be displayed by the Ponca tribe at the Nebraska State Historical Society or if it would be in the Ponca Museum,” Brewer said.
After receiving the call from Brewer’s office “out of the blue” offering the senator’s support, Chapman decided to draft the letter to Pickering.
In the letter, Chapman cited the museum’s recent apology for its curatorial actions around Native American cultural items and human remains.
“If museum administrators want to live up to their recent apology with actions, I submit that you can either voluntarily repatriate this relic or make a deal that results in Harvard admitting some Ponca students if the University desires to keep it,” Chapman wrote.
“This tomahawk belongs with the Ponca people,” he added.
In 1878, Standing Bear left the Ponca reservation in Oklahoma along with 29 others to bury his son in Nebraska, where he had been born. Standing Bear was arrested for leaving the reservation. In the subsequent landmark trial a federal judge ruled for the first time that Native Americans were legally defined as persons, with the right to sue for their own freedom.
Standing Bear’s historical importance gives his tomahawk a special significance to the Ponca people, said Wright, the Nebraska Ponca tribe chairman.
“The whole reason the Ponca tribe of Nebraska is in Nebraska today is because of what Standing Bear and those that came back with him were willing to do,” he said. “They were willing to die to come back to Nebraska after we were wrongfully removed to Oklahoma, and we’re here today because of those efforts.”
“To have an item like that, that he owned, that still exists, and what it represents, historically, as we continue to be here today — from that context alone, that’s a huge thing,” he added.
After the trial, Standing Bear gave his tomahawk to John L. Webster, a lawyer who represented him pro bono in that case, as a gesture of gratitude, Chapman said. The Museum received the tomahawk in 1982, but can only directly trace its provenance as far back as a collection of Native American items sold by the widow of an Omaha lawyer in 1930; it is unclear how that lawyer came to possess it.
Chapman said his request for the return of Standing Bear’s tomahawk to the Ponca tribe is different from other repatriation claims that have arisen in recent months in that it is on “moral” grounds, rather than legal.
Since Standing Bear first willingly gave away his tomahawk as a gift, Chapman doesn’t contest the Museum’s legal right to its ownership, he said. His argument is that Standing Bear would never have given his tomahawk to Webster in the first place were it not for the injustice of his arrest, and, more broadly, the U.S. government’s mistreatment of the Ponca tribe and other Native Americans.
“The whole thing is completely illegitimate to me,” Chapman said. “If that injustice, which was illegitimate, didn't happen, he wouldn’t have needed to hire the white lawyer who gave the tomahawk away. It’s just a whole chain of events that’s all illegitimate.”
“We’re still here – the Poncas are still here,” he added. “Why shouldn't we have it? Harvard had absolutely no connection to any of this stuff. They’re just someone who ended up with it.”
Pickering said she agreed with Chapman that the Museum’s ownership of the tomahawk, while legal, is an “ethical issue.”
“He is right,” she said. “It’s a moral and an ethical issue.”
Pickering pointed to a recent policy shift that codified the Museum’s willingness to respond to requests for repatriation that go beyond its legal obligations. In response to a February letter from the Association on American Indian Affairs, the Museum agreed to return certain Native American funerary objects that it had not been obligated by law to repatriate under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
In a May 10 letter to the Ponca tribal chairmen about the repatriation of the tomahawk, Pickering also suggested discussions about the repatriation of 37 funerary objects in the Museum’s collections that it has culturally affiliated to the Ponca people.”
In the interview, Pickering also pointed to the Peabody’s long-term loan in 2016 of a Native Alutiiq kayak to the Alutiiq Museum in Alaska, on the terms requested by Alutiiq leaders, as an example of the Peabody’s willingness to collaborate with indigenous communities with regard to culturally significant items.
“It’s about partnership with the community, with the idea of trying to do the right thing,” she said.
Pickering said the first meeting with the Ponca tribal leaders and Chapman will be via Zoom, but that future discussions might take place at Harvard, in Nebraska, or in Oklahoma.
Chapman hasn’t yet been to the Peabody to see the tomahawk in person, he said.
“I plan to go up there and get it whenever they decide to give it back,” he added.

Koji A. Everard ’21 was fast asleep at home in Tokyo when his blockmate woke him up with the news they both won the 2021 Thomas T. Hoopes prize for outstanding scholarly work or research.
“He called me at like 2:30 or 3:00 a.m. because he saw the email and he saw my name when he checked the list. So I answered his phone and I was like, ‘yo what’s up it’s 3 a.m.’ and then he's like, ‘Have you checked your email?’" Everard said. “It was a nice way to find out.”
Everard and his friend were two out of 74 undergraduate students chosen by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for the annual Hoopes prize this year, which was announced May 6.
The award is funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, and seeks to promote the “quality of education” by “recognizing, promoting, honoring, and rewarding excellence in the work of undergraduates and their capabilities and skills in any subject.” Each student winner is awarded $5,000 and each nominating faculty member is awarded $2,000. Winning theses are displayed in Lamont Library for two years.
Everard’s thesis, presented to the History department, focused on the sugar beet economy in interwar Hokkaido, the northernmost main island in Japan.
“I was looking specifically at how states attempt to use agriculture to refashion ecologies and political economies at the same time,” Everard said. “My overall argument was that beets were at the core of a state project to remake Hokkaido and further its settler colonial project.”
His thesis, which was nominated for the Hoopes by History professor Ian J. Miller, was originally supposed to focus on New Zealand. Everand was forced to “pivot” his topic after University-sponsored travel was suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, prompting him to focus his study on his home country, Japan.
Applied Mathematics and Economics concentrator Hannah J. Ellery ’21 won the Hoopes for her thesis titled “Big Names, Bigger Barriers: Firm Reputation and Its Role as a Barrier to Entry.” Ellery said it took her “an absolute huge amount of time” to research and write the thesis.
“I don’t even know how to quantify it. I started in earnest probably late July of last year,” Ellery said. “I worked on it almost every day, for like most of every day — I think this is uncommon, but I got really obsessed with it.”
Statistics concentrator Katherine Deng ’21 was nominated for the Hoopes by Economics professor Benjamin Golub and Statistics professor Tracy Ke for her thesis, which focused on how Americans form communities and groupings based on “both demographic and cultural attitudes.” Deng said she was partly inspired to research the topic after taking Golub’s class.
“He was just a fantastic professor. He had really lively, dynamic teaching, and I think I wasn’t the only one who was super, super fascinated by the topic afterwards,” Deng said. “So after the class, I read my advisor’s advisor’s book and kind of got really into this topic.”
Hoopes winner and Anthropology concentrator Che R. Applewhaite ’21 composed a thesis in the form of a short documentary titled “A New England Document: Proto-Cinematic Practice against Genocidal Acceptability.” Applewhaite’s film questions and reflects on the Peabody Museum’s Lorna J. and Laurence K. Marshall Archive, which hosts thousands of ethnographic photographs of Ju/’hoansi tribespeoples indigenous to the Kalahari Desert in Namibia.
Applewhaite’s film has been selected for several film festivals, including the prominent 2020 Sheffield Doc Fest. Applewhaite said his favorite part of creating the thesis has been the impact his film has had on others.
“I think for me the process of speaking to people who are both in my field, but also not in my field, about anthropology, ethnography and specifically its relationship to the documentaries as a whole — that was really eye-opening because I didn’t realize how much the work can actually be of interest to people who want to kind of make documentaries in a critical way,” Applewhaite said.
Ellery described writing a thesis as a “phenomenal” academic experience that had a positive impact on her senior year. Despite having to reconfigure her thesis multiple times, Ellery said the process made her feel connected to a largely virtual campus.
“It’s probably my favorite thing that I’ve ever done at a school academically,” Ellery said. “It was also really nice in a time when we all feel sort of disconnected from campus to have something that was so grounding and felt very clear with measurable objectives.”
A full list of this year’s Hoopes Prize awardees is available here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Matthew Ichihashi Potts will serve as the next Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals beginning July 1, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in an email to Harvard affiliates last Friday.
Potts, who received both his Master of Divinity and Ph.D. in the Study of Religion from Harvard, currently serves as an associate professor at the Harvard Divinity School and an affiliated minister at Memorial Church.
Bacow highlighted Potts’ scholarship and sustained investment in spiritual teaching in his email announcing Potts’ appointment.
“Matt is a gifted preacher who brings to the pulpit a deep appreciation and understanding of texts rooted in his own acclaimed academic work at the intersection of religion and literature,” he wrote. “His incisive research and scholarly achievements are complemented by an extraordinary devotion to teaching.”
Stephanie A. Paulsell, a Divinity School professor who served as the interim minister during the two-year search, said she is confident in Potts’ ability to lead University affiliates and residents of the greater Boston area in fostering spiritual dialogue and fellowship at the Memorial Church.
“He just has a way of inviting people into these very deep human questions that I think will work really well with the Memorial Church, which is really an intergenerational community that’s made up of students and faculty and staff, and a lot of people who live in the neighborhood,” Paulsell said.
A colleague of Potts’ since 2013, Paulsell served as a member of the Search Advisory Committee for the new Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, which was chaired by Bacow. Originally anticipated to last a year, the committee extended into 2021 due to challenges brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Paulsell. The committee voted unanimously to appoint Potts.
Potts, whose mother is of Japanese descent, is the first Asian American to assume the position of Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church. He said in an interview that growing up in a family of both Christians and Buddhists allowed him to cultivate an appreciation for spiritual diversity, a quality he hopes to continue fostering in his new position.
“The unique position that Memorial Church has at Harvard affords us the opportunity to be part of inter-religious conversations, and to participate in diverse kinds of programming that is rare even among university churches,” he said.
Paulsell said the accessible, collaborative nature of the Memorial Church places Potts in a unique position to bring a diverse set of people together in spiritual conversation.
“Memorial Church is one of the most open places in the University — you don’t have to have an ID to get in there,” she said. “It’s a really interesting place, a really interesting mix of people who are really eager to listen to each other and to learn from each other and to ask searching questions together. And I think he’ll be just wonderful in that part of the job.”
Potts said he is proud to serve as the first Asian American minister in Memorial Church, particularly given the recent rise in anti-Asian violence.
“I’m proud that there’s a Japanese name, Ichihashi, attached to this position,” he said. “I’m proud that, in this particular moment, I get to carry that identity with me, as complicated as it is, into this new role where thinking about diversity, thinking about inclusion, is part of the mission of the place.”
The Plummer Professorship of Christian Morals and the position of the Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church were established in 1854 and 1997, respectively. Potts succeeds Jonathan L. Walton in both positions, following Walton’s departure to serve as the dean of Wake Forest University School of Divinity in 2019.
