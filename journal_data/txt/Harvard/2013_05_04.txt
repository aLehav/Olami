Patrick Marber’s “Closer” is a play of extreme, if shallow, intensity. It features only four characters, each of whom is pitilessly revealed to be selfish, narcissistic, and hypocritical. In a setting as intimate as the Loeb Ex, “Closer”, which ran until April 27 and was directed by Lily R. Glimcher ‘14, had an almost suffocating effect. Although originally written as a play, “Closer” is perhaps best known to American audiences through Mike Nichols’ 2004 film version, which starred Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman ’03. More suited to stage than screen, it is nonetheless an excessively verbose play that explores its central themes with all the subtlety of an Ayn Rand novel and frequently resorts to melodrama. The deficiencies of the script were partially redeemed, however, by a resourceful and inventive production that transcended its minimalist set and by a remarkably mature and versatile performance by Max R. McGillivray ’16.
McGillivray plays Daniel Woolf, a self-described failed writer who writes obituaries for a newspaper. The play opens with Daniel in a doctor’s waiting room, where he has accompanied a stranger who he rescued from an accident. That stranger is Alice Ayres (Rachel A. Gibian ’15), a waitress and former stripper. At this point, Daniel is a socially awkward, insecure young man, disarmed by Alice’s confident sexuality. One year later, the action resumes—Daniel and Alice have been dating for a year, and Daniel is utterly transformed, now the author of a novel about Alice’s life. Chance encounters with two other characters—Anna (Georgina B. Parfitt ’13), a photographer who takes a picture of Daniel for the jacket of his book and Larry (Jacob A. Brandt ’14), the doctor from the opening scene—set up the rest of the action. Both Daniel and Larry fall for Anna, and her inability to decisively choose between the two is spun out into two hours of sexual drama.
The characters are obsessed, above all, with the nature of truth, but unlike other contemporary plays that share this concern, such as Michael Frayn’s “Copenhagen” or John Patrick Shanley’s “Doubt,” “Closer” has frustratingly little to say about its central subject. More interesting is the play’s exploration of the distinction between childhood and adulthood. Daniel abandons Alice, who loves him distractedly, for Anna ostensibly because Alice is a “child.” By the final scenes, however, Alice appears to be the most self-aware of the four, and Daniel the most childlike and emotionally needy. The script is pervaded by long, repetitive dialogue, and a love affair with profanity so torrid as to be almost absurd. One notable exception to this repetition if not the profanity was the hilarious scene in which Daniel, posing as Anna, has cyber sex with Larry in an online chat room. This was ingeniously staged with a screen in between the two characters in which the audience could see the chat, and marked [WC] the highlight of the production.
Daniel is by some distance the most complex character, and McGillivray played him with poise, whether he was a cad, a seducer, a nerd, or a rejected lover. He was most impressive and convincing when conveying Daniel’s vulnerability, one aspect of his character that was evident throughout the play. The role of Alice Ayres is arguably just as challenging—Gibian was most effective­ in the early scenes where she was cutesy and coquettish and in the second act where, clad in a corset and blue wig, she impressively pulled off a striptease act in a London club. But she never truly captured Alice’s emotional depth or managed to transcend the coquettish side of her persona in the dramatic scenes that called for greater emotional range. Parfitt, cast as Anna, the temptress, played her character in an unexpectedly aloof and disengaged manner, but she succeeded in delivering the script’s few moments of true comedy, such as her spot-on impression of an elderly aristocratic British stepmother. For much of the action, Brandt played Larry as a bluff, unemotional straight man, but he shone in a pivotal late scene that ended with him telling Anna to “fuck off and die!”
Marber’s script calls for minimalist set design and staging, and Glimcher followed this instruction in innovative ways. Parts of the set were rearranged to construct the play’s various environments. Most impressive was the seamless switch from strip club to café with the sole addition of a small table. Other prop decisions such as the use of photo frames as gravestones were less convincing. Overall, Glimcher and her team approached the script with ingenuity in the staging, an impressive feat given the emotional limitations of the source material.

Trouble for Venezuela: Polarization and Disappointment post-Chavez
Prior to Chávez’s actual death, I already had thoughts about what a post-Chavez Venezuela would look like. I used to think that Venezuela after Chavez would undergo extreme political fractionalization. Chávez had handpicked a successor, Nicolás Maduro, but tension still existed within his party as other potential leaders felt cast aside. The opposition had only unified for the first time against Chávez in the 2012 election and without a common figure to oppose, it would be unlikely for the opposition to remain unified.
Chavez’s death did not result in this degree of fragmentation, however. The chavista Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela party remained unified, as did the opposition, going into the election on April 14. However, although Venezuela has not become fractionalized, it has become extremely polarized. Maduro barely won Sunday’s election with 50.7 percent of the vote, versus Capriles’s 49.1 percent, a difference that in itself would be enough to cause commotion. What is perhaps even more frustrating is that distrust in the government and the National Electoral Council is well founded enough that there is no way to be sure that the announced election results are legitimate.
Maduro’s election strategy was to present himself almost as a reincarnation of Chávez, even wearing the same track suit with the Venezuelan flag that Chávez was known for and blasting a recording of Chavez’s voice singing the national anthem at rallies. The fact of the matter is that Venezuela has not elected Chávez; the presidency has been handed over to a leader who is far less charismatic and politically competent. Roughly half of Venezuela, according to election results at least, already opposes Maduro; the other half will soon face the harsh reality that Maduro is not Chávez, no matter how hard he tries. Venezuelans on both sides seem to be headed towards political disappointment, and with a recent history of disrespect for democratic institutions in the country, the response to this disappointment with the government could be drastic.

Venezuela’s Regional Agenda Will Take the Backseat
As we watch the post-electoral chaos unfold in Venezuela, many of us Latin Americans ponder a common question: What will the new, post-Chávez Venezuela mean for the rest of the region?
Armed with petrodollars, blazing rhetoric, and a persuasive ideology, Chávez spent much of his time in office attempting to spread his ideals and policy objectives across the region. This directly contributed to many of the past decade’s great transformations in Latin American relations: the creation of the Union of South American Nations and the Bolivarian Alliance, the rise of a “pink tide” of like-minded populist and leftist presidents in countries like Bolivia and Argentina, the gradual exclusion of the United States and Canada from regional affairs, and the vilification of Colombia and other right-wing governments in the region. Troubled right-wing parties, along with U.S. administrations that were either too unpopular (Bush’s) or too passive (Obama’s), helped clear the path for these changes.
Assuming that Nicolás Maduro will survive the current political crisis relatively unscathed, he is unlikely to give this regional agenda much attention anytime soon. Some of the logic behind this is intuitive: He will be busy reconstructing his legitimacy among Venezuelans and building foreign policy consensus among chavista leaders. But he will also be forced to confront a deeply troubled economy, putting at risk resources previously spent in the electoral campaigns and hydrocarbon needs of neighboring nations. Moreover, regional alignment around policies favored by the late Chávez may begin to fade as left-wing governments in the region face a series of significant electoral challenges in the months and years ahead.
This presents an important opportunity for the region: It is a chance to give broader legitimacy to promising institutions like UNASUR by maintaining worthwhile elements of Chávez’s agenda (greater regional cooperation, for instance) while ridding them of the more destructive aspects of his political legacy (such as his fuzzy relationship with democratic values). The question, of course, is whether Latin America’s leaders will rise up to the occasion.

The Bumpy Road Ahead
A post-Chavez Venezuela has a tough road ahead. Nicolas Maduro, Hugo Chavez’s Vice President and chosen successor, was just elected president on Sunday; though not unexpected, his victory was very narrow. Maduro won by about 234,000 votes, or 1.5 percent as of now. Compared to Chavez’s 9 percent margin of victory in the recent October 2012 elections, Maduro’s surprisingly narrow victory signals growing discontent among Venezuelans with extremely high levels of crime, state corruption and inefficiency, and food shortages. The opposition’s calls for a recount and refusal to accept Maduro as president similarly demonstrate the precarious situation in Venezuela.
Under Chavez, Venezuela became a society fiercely divided between Chavez supporters and his opponents. This political divide extended into citizens’ access to public services, government jobs, and many of Chavez’s popular social programs. This conflict played out in the election and will continue to be a defining feature of Venezuelan politics and society in the years to come. Chavez was a charismatic, personal leader who is revered by many Venezuelans because of his social programs and political inclusion of the poor. His supporters will remember him and uphold his legacy for years to come, possibly carving out a party like the Peronist party in Argentina which remains a party centered on the legacy of former populist president Juan Peron.
However, his opponents will remember his vitriolic attitude towards the opposition and overt manipulation of government resources. Venezuela is also facing economic troubles. The nation’s economy is based on its production of oil. However, oil prices have been falling from their mid-2000s highs along with Venezuela’s yearly production of oil, setting up a troubling paradox of Venezuelan dependence on oil. President-elect Maduro will have to deal with the economic pitfalls of a weakened oil sector and undeveloped alternative industries. Mixed with the newly fortified opposition, Venezuela has a long road ahead, and one only hopes that it will navigate it carefully.

Don’t Expect Miracles from Venezuela
Following the death of Hugo Chávez, some commentators believed that there might have been a thaw in U.S.-Venezuelan relations. Tensions between the two countries, after all, had mostly resulted from rhetorical battles between Chávez and American leaders, and chances seemed good for a more moderate president in Caracas.
Unfortunately, however, all of that hope came to naught, and Chávez’s hand-picked successor, newly elected President Nicholás Maduro, has made a show of maintaining—or even increasing—his predecessor’s level of anti-American rhetoric. Our own government in Washington, meanwhile, has indicated that it is unwilling to compromise with what it sees as a continuation of the former government.
That being said, the most likely future for U.S.-Venezuelan relations is not a détente of sorts, but rather, further bitterness and impasse. The primary reason for this is that Maduro won his election in the first place. Maduro can claim that the Venezuelan people have overwhelmingly endorsed the ideals of the former government, which include anti-American rhetoric, unfriendly economic policies, and close relations with nations such as Cuba and Iran. With his victory as evidence, he can claim that his people had not simply tolerated these policies because they had so admired Chávez. Instead, he can claim a mandate to continue.
Furthermore, Maduro’s government has received unprecedented support from Latin American nations. While Chávez’s government traditionally relied on smaller nations such as Cuba and Nicaragua to support it economically and politically, the Maduro government has already received official affirmations of support from regional powerhouses such as Argentina, Peru, and Brazil. With this kind of support, Venezuela can confidently work to diminish American power in the region in unprecedented ways.
Basically, a post-Chávez Venezuela does not mean a friendlier Venezuela. If the United States wants to see more amicable relations with the South American side, the government in Washington is going to have to put forth all the effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the vast majority of student-athletes who enter Harvard’s football program, four years in a Crimson uniform represents the finale of a career on the gridiron. But for a few, it’s not enough.
For senior running back Treavor Scales, his 63-yard touchdown sprint that sealed Harvard’s victory over Yale in The Game was not just the culmination of one career, but rather the impetus for a new one.
From earning the Ivy League Rookie of the Year honor as a freshman to recording his first 1000-yard rushing season in his final year as a collegiate player, Scales certainly has had a prolific career—but the senior isn’t done yet.
“This is kind of like one of those sappy, lifelong dreams that I’ve always had,” Scales says. “It’s kind of something I pushed to the back and didn’t really let anyone know of until I saw that it could come true. Things just start clicking—from the beginning of my junior year, when I finally got that starting position and I was hearing more and more talk about the possibility of getting to the next level, it became more of a given that I would make that leap [to the NFL] rather than ‘I’ll just do it just to make sure I don’t look back and say ‘what if.’”
With the NFL Draft over, the Stone Mountain, Ga. native now looks to follow in the footsteps of recently-drafted teammate Kyle Juszczyk and find a spot on the roster of one of 32 NFL teams. Scales cites the success of Juszczyk, an H-back drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the fourth round, as both inspiring and helpful to his own potential career.
“We knew for a long time that Juice was going to get drafted, and because of his popularity, for lack of a better term, we knew that we were going to get a better look,” Scales says. “It was kind of like that whole deal where you’ve got a guy that’s bringing around a lot of scouts, it’s a good opportunity for you, so from that standpoint, it was awesome, and knowing that a guy could do it from our school and seeing him competing with those big names, it was that much more inspiring. We could all do this, we could all go out there and compete with the best of them.”
Scales participated in Harvard’s annual Pro Day, which mimics the NFL Combine to showcase the talents of Crimson football players looking to enter the NFL, and recorded a sub-4.5 40-yard dash at the meet—a faster time than that of Giovani Bernard, the top running back pick of the 2013 draft. Senior offensive lineman John Collins parlayed his Crimson Pro Day showing into an invitation to the Seattle Seahawks’ rookie mini-camp.
“For some guys, it’s a very specific and easy route to the NFL,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “For a lot of other really great college football players, it’s very uncertain. Treavor’s a terrific college football player, he has NFL-level speed, and we think he’s a kid that could make a roster. It’s very difficult for skill guys—there’s so many of them, when you put it together with all the BCS schools, to make a name for themselves. I thought Treavor to some extent did that with his tremendous testing at our Pro Day backed up by some really outstanding film, but sometimes it takes more than that.”
Because Scales was not picked during the draft, the senior will now become a free agent and try out at various rookie mini-camps in an effort to land a contract.
“It’s essentially the same process as the draft except the players have the opportunity to choose which team to go with if you have a lot of suitors, so after the draft, after the free agent signings, there’s calls that go out to offer tryouts, to see if they want to sign a free agent at that point,” Scales says. “From there, you go on to the July training camp and into season, with a series of cuts in between.”
Of the teams that Scales has talked to, the Atlanta Falcons and Cleveland Browns have shown particular interest in the tailback. The senior has flown out to Atlanta once already for a local tryout and is headed back this weekend for another tryout.
Although the process has been lengthy, as the senior has had to continue his training during his final semester of college, Scales cites his support system as being integral to his success.
“[Coach Murphy] is making sure that I can get all the publicity that I can garner and also just looking out for my overall well-being, making sure that I’m enjoying the process, and all of the other coaches on staff are always trying to keep abreast with all of the happenings with the guys that are trying to make this next step,” Scales says. “My family, we’re always loving every bit of this experience…. My little brother found out that I’m being scouted by one of his favorite teams and we got to go nuts over that. Every one of my friends, my teammates—pretty much a synonymous term—they’ve just been great, really supportive of the whole process.”
While Scales notes that the Falcons would be his ideal team, he would be excited to continue his journey with any team.
“Being from Stone Mountain, I’m always rooting for the Falcons, so getting to go back to Atlanta would just be the great, clichéd, hometown kid coming back home, getting to play ball for his favorite professional team [story],” Scales says. “But any opportunity that I can get in the NFL would be an amazing opportunity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say 16 is the sweetest. Such was true as the No. 2 Harvard heavyweight men’s crew team bested both No. 4 Northeastern and Holy Cross in five races on Saturday on the Charles River. The wins allowed the Crimson to capture the 16th straight Smith Cup over its cross-town rivals.
The first boats took to the water before eight AM for the fifth varsity four race. While the Harvard ‘A’ boat won outright in 6:54.8, Crimson teammates in the ‘C’ and ‘B’ boats were not far behind, respectively taking second and third. After catching a crab at the 800-meter mark, the Holy Cross boat finished last in 7:30.0, 20 seconds behind the ‘B’ boat.
The fourth varsity four race also saw Harvard establish a sizeable lead over opponents, with the ‘B’ boat capturing first place in 6:38.6 and the ‘A’ boat taking second seven seconds later. Northeastern rounded out the trio nearly eight seconds later.
The slimmest margin of victory came in the third varsity eight race, as the Crimson’s first freshman boat battled through catching a crab late in the final 15 strokes to edge the Huskies by just over a second, 5:48.2 to 5:49.8.
Winning came easier for the second varsity boat. While Harvard and Northeastern stayed close to one another for the first 1000 meters, as the Crimson came out from under the Harvard Bridge the boat began to gain on its opponent and won with a lead of nearly a whole boat length.
The first varsity boat remained undefeated over its six spring contests as the eight grabbed yet another win. Like the second eight, the first 1000 meters were knotted for Harvard and the Huskies, but the Crimson opened a significant lead by the 1500-meter mark and took the Smith Cup with open water. Harvard won the race by almost four seconds, 5.30.8 to 5:34.2.
Saturday’s races conclude the season on the Charles for the Crimson, as the squad will resume competition at the EARC Sprints in two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say that all good things must come to an end.
Apparently, the Radcliffe lightweight crews did not get that memo, as the Black and White took to the Cooper River on Sunday and swept every varsity event it entered. With the victories, the first and second varsity eights remain undefeated and enter IRA Nationals as the top-ranked crews nationally.
Roughly 500 miles away on the Scioto River on Saturday, the Radcliffe heavyweights took on Ohio State as its final test before the postseason. After ceding the first race to the Black and White, the third-ranked Buckeyes took the next three.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
In the final race before Ivy League Championships, it was the least experienced boat of the Radcliffe heavyweight crew that pulled out the lone victory over Ohio State.
“It was really important to me that we have a chance to race a really fast team out of the Ivy Conference and out of our region,” Harvard coach Liz O’Leary said. “I’ve been talking about this, it’s just something that’s pretty important on our racing schedule and I knew it would be a challenge.”
The third varsity boat, comprised mostly of rookies, was first on the water for the Black and White. It bested the Buckeye’s novice eight boat by seven seconds, rowing the 2,000-meter course in 7:09.47.
“We led start to finish; it was exciting to see them do that,” O’Leary said. “The thing that means a lot to me is that boat is a group of freshmen, for the most part. There are a handful of freshmen in that boat who are really learning a lot and getting good racing experiences in, and realizing what the level of competition out there is, and I was really excited to see them win.”
The final three races—the varsity four, second varsity eight, and first varsity eight—were the NCAA-qualifying races, and strong winds on the river created difficult racing conditions for the crews.
The first varsity eight race ended the day, with Ohio State’s top boat just edging Radcliffe’s by three seconds. The Black and White kept pace with the Buckeyes through much of the race but began losing ground in the third 500, with Ohio State finally pulling away in the final 500.
“For a good chunk of the way, it was a seat-to-seat kind of race, and that’s the fun kind you love to have,” O’Leary said. “I was hoping we could respond in the fourth 500, but we couldn’t. They are a big, strong [crew]—they’ve been proving it all spring, that they’re contenders.”
The second varsity eight took on the nationally top-ranked Buckeyes 2V boat and fell at the midpoint of the race to finish the race in 7:15:35, 14 seconds behind Ohio State’s crew. The varsity four faced similar struggles, taking on three Buckeyes’ boats and coming in fourth after matching Ohio State’s ‘B’ boat stroke-for-stroke for the majority of the course.
“We were competitive with the second four for 95 percent of the race, but couldn’t quite hang on to their first four, and then their third four kind of came up,” O’Leary said. “With this boat, I thought they sort of lost their rhythm, lost the ability to be intense during the drive, and that began in the headwind. In the four, that’s a tough thing to have happen.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
For the first time since 2004, the sprints crown has returned to Radcliffe. The first varsity eights showed again why they are ranked first in the nation on Sunday afternoon, blowing past No. 3 Princeton and crossing the finish line in 7:17.8, over eight seconds before any other crew.
“It’s an amazing feeling,” said senior Emma Lukasiewicz, sixth seat of the first varsity eight. “As a senior, it’s so exciting after a lot of hard work but a lot of good improvement, so to finally see the results pay off is a huge gain for the program. To sweep all of the varsity events, it’s just so exciting to see the improvements that our program has made, and every girl on this team deserves this success.”
The boat held its own against the Tigers in the first half of the race before finding its rhythm and stroking to an open-water lead in the third 500.
“Nothing’s really certain, but around the 1,000 we had a pretty comfortable distance, but we definitely just wanted to keep pushing it out,” Lukasiewicz said. “You never know when a crew’s going to make a move.”
The third varsity four started the streak early, with the Black and White crew outstripping the rest of the field by over 10 seconds.
After the novice eight fell to Wisconsin’s crew by a little over a minute in the grand final, the second varsity eight found the top of the medal stand again. The crew rowed the course in 7:34.4, edging the Badgers’ boat by less than two seconds.

UPDATED: May 4, 2013 at 1:58 p.m.
When Niall Ferguson found himself behind the podium of a recent conference of over 500 financial advisors and investors, he took the opportunity to make remarks that proved insulting to Keynesian economics, gay people, childless adults, and most reasonable bystanders, all in one fell swoop.
According to a report in Financial Advisor, Ferguson explained one of the twentieth century's most influential economic theories as a product of Keynes' sexual orientation and childlessness. Keynes' ideas were not forward thinking, Ferguson allegedly said, because the economist was gay, "effete," and did not care much for traditional heterosexual reproduction. As such, the History professor implied, Keynes was not concerned with the implications of his favored economic policies for future generations. Unsurprisingly, the room reportedly fell silent at the comment. (Our jaws dropped in a similar manner.)
 
Ferguson's knack for provocative comments frequently lands him in tussles with fellow intellectuals and the media alike. And he's been known to take a "sorry, not sorry" approach to most of these situations.
This time, however, Ferguson recognized his blunder, calling his comments "as stupid as they were insensitive," in an e-mail statement to The Crimson, which he also posted on his personal blog.
Ferguson's full statement is included below: 
During a recent question-and-answer session at a conference in California, I made comments about John Maynard Keynes that were as stupid as they were insensitive.
I had been asked to comment on Keynes's famous observation "In the long run we are all dead." The point I had made in my presentation was that in the long run our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren are alive, and will have to deal with the consequences of our economic actions.
But I should not have suggested—in an off-the-cuff response that was not part of my presentation—that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was gay. This was doubly stupid. First, it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations. Second, I had forgotten that Keynes's wife Lydia miscarried.
My disagreements with Keynes's economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation. It is simply false to suggest, as I did, that his approach to economic policy was inspired by any aspect of his personal life. As those who know me and my work are well aware, I detest all prejudice, sexual or otherwise.
My colleagues, students, and friends—straight and gay—have every right to be disappointed in me, as I am in myself. To them, and to everyone who heard my remarks at the conference or has read them since, I deeply and unreservedly apologize.

It's not hard sneaking into a formal—all you have to do is draw some X's on your hands and say you're with the band. It's once you're inside that things get difficult. Do your salmon shorts count as formal? And when they play Journey, do you pretend like you're over it or preform the dance you memorized from the first season of "Glee?" There is no easy answer to these questions; they're rhetorical. What's more, formals are not easy; they are an awkward mix of 90's hits and oversized camping tents. But they can be fun, and luckily I have some tips for correctly crashing a formal.
1. Attire
Don't: Accidentally dress semi-formal, or business formal, or for the mall. That would be a disaster, and no one wants to see your blazer. 
Do: Wear a bow tie. If you don't know how to tie one just wear it around your neck or pin it to your dress.
 
2. Drinking
Don't: Ask your overage friend to get you a drink from the open bar. That's desperate. 
Do: Look for half-empty bottles of beer and unfinished glasses of champagne left on tables. That's recycling.

 
3. Music 
Don't: Request Justin Bieber.
Do: Request Justin Bieber and then pretend to complain about it when he comes on.
 
4. Leaving.
Don't: Leave early. You have to get your money's worth.
Do: Leave early. You didn't pay.
