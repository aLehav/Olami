After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a sea of closings, Harvard Square bid adieu to its nearest Au Bon Pain last week.
The restaurant — which closed Jan. 8 — announced its departure to customers in a Jan. 4 email, joining Crema Cafe, Chipotle, Tealuxe, Urban Outfitters, and Sweet Bakery in departing from long-held locations in the Square since the start of December.
The fast casual bakery-cafe chain, which opened its 1100 Massachusetts Ave. location in 1990, offers an array of soups, sandwiches, and pastries. It takes its name from the French translation of “from good bread.”
Consumer spending habits, market saturation, and changing loyalties are among the most prevalent reasons for Au Bon Pain’s departure, according to Harvard Square Business Association Director Denise A. Jillson. Jillson wrote in an email that this recent flood of Harvard Square closings is not uncommon and represents the natural business cycle of the area.
“While the closing of Au Bon Pain will undoubtedly leave some folks inconvenienced and sad, others will eagerly anticipate a new enterprise,” Jillson wrote. “This is the ever-changing nature of a robust business district where, for the most part, the consumer decides who stays and who goes.”
Au Bon Pain Co. media did not respond to a request for comment.
The recent closure marks the chain’s final departure from Harvard Square. In 2016, Au Bon Pain’s Smith Campus Center location, made famous after appearing in 1997 film “Good Will Hunting,” closed its doors for major building renovations that were completed this past fall.
Ronald M. Schaich, a Harvard Business School graduate, and Louis Kane founded Au Bon Pain Co. Inc. in 1981, before later establishing Panera Bread. Au Bon Pain was acquired by Panera Bread in late 2017.
Linda A. Kidwell said she was a frequent customer of Au Bon Pain because of its affordability and commitment to fresh foods. A former Harvard employee in the Student Billing Office, she recalled her sadness over the closing of the Smith Campus Center location nearly three years ago.
“[Au Bon Pain] was part of my daily experience there, so I’m sorry to see it go,” she said of the recent closure. “I think it was a great little place. There weren’t that many of them in those days, so it was special.”
Though she said she believes most of her peers were unaware of Au Bon Pain’s existence, Allie Quan ’21 said the restaurant occupied a special place in her heart. Whenever she fell ill, Quan said she could always count on Au Bon Pain to deliver comfort in the form of soupy sustenance.
“This is literally the only place that I found I could get chicken noodle soup nearby, so I’m not really sure what I’m going to do now,” Quan said. “I’m confused, horrified, sad.”
Hungry Cambridge residents looking to treat themselves to a soup or sandwich can still satisfy their cravings at four nearby Au Bon Pain restaurants: one located further down the street at 684 Mass. Ave., as well as three others in Kendall Square, Davis Square, and the Cambridgeside Galleria.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard voted on shareholder proposals concerning digital media content and corporate tax policy for the first time in 2018, among a series of other issues that have previously arisen, according to the University’s annual shareholder responsibility report published Tuesday.
Harvard’s Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility — made up of alumni, faculty, and students — and its Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, which can accept or reject the advisory committee’s recommendations, vote annually on a series of proposals to companies of which the University is a shareholder in order to communicate its interests.
Law professor Howell E. Jackson chaired the 2018 advisory committee, and Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — William F. Lee ’72 chaired the Corporation committee. University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 and Corporation members Jessica T. Mathews ’67 and Shirley M. Tilghman also served on the Corporation committee.
The committees considered both new issues and proposal topics that have come up in the past, including corporate political spending, executive compensation, and environmental issues.
The advisory committee, for example, supported nine similar proposals asking companies to report on their lobbying activities. Since the Supreme Court’s ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010, a large number of proposals have related to corporate lobbying and campaign spending, according to the report.
“Committee members commented that it is in shareholders’ best interests to understand companies’ political spending, in part because of potential reputational risks,” the report reads.
During last year’s shareholder voting period, Harvard endorsed a proposal asking Wells Fargo to produce a report about its approach to indigenous peoples’ rights. This year, Harvard also backed a proposal for Citigroup to establish an indigenous peoples’ rights policy.
Harvard also considered several proposals regarding environmental issues. One proposal asked Chevron to examine its business model “to align with a decarbonizing economy” by shifting away from fossil fuels.
Harvard abstained, noting agreement with the principle behind the proposal but concluding that it was “a business decision for the company rather than a matter for shareholder input.”
Over the past year activists have ramped up efforts to convince Harvard to fully divest itself from fossil fuels, but University President Lawrence S. Bacow has joined his predecessors in continuing to reject their demands. The two committees did not consider any proposals directly calling on companies to eliminate their fossil fuel ties.
The committee also weighed in on new issues this year, including social media data privacy and corporate taxation.
Both committees supported a proposal to Facebook calling on the company to report to shareholders the degree to which platform’s terms of service agreements are being respected and the “risks posed by content management controversies (including election interference, fake news, hate speech, sexual harassment, and violence).”
Harvard cited news reports about the role of fake news in the 2016 United States Presidential election as part of the committees’ decision to vote in favor of the proposal.
Another proposal called on Facebook to review its global tax strategy and ensure that the company was paying taxes “where value is created.”
The advisory committee recommended against the proposal, pointing to recent changes in federal corporate tax law. The committee also argued that as shareholders in the company, “it makes little sense to expect a company to pay more taxes than current law requires.” The Corporation committee agreed, casting Harvard’s vote in opposition.
In total, the committees considered 38 proposals in 2018, the fewest since 2011. An additional eight proposals were submitted after the advisory committee concluded its meetings, so the Corporation committee voted according to previous years’ precedents or abstained if there was no earlier decision to follow. Last year, the advisory committee voted on 44 proposals.
The two committees agreed on 34 of the 38 proposals the advisory committee considered, and the Corporation committee abstained on the four proposals where the advisory committee was split.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Funding lapses and restricted access to collaborators and resources — consequences of the longest government shutdown in United States history — have left some Harvard faculty members’ research projects mired in uncertainty, though most remain insulated from the shutdown’s effects for now.
The shutdown — which began in late December when national legislators could not resolve a dispute over funding for a proposed border wall — has left more than 800,000 federal employees either furloughed or forced to work without pay. Some government agencies and programs, though, received funding before the shutdown and are not impacted.
Both the National Institutes of Health and Department of Defense — which together provided roughly 81 percent of the $613 million in federal funding that Harvard received in 2017 — are among the agencies that remain open, sparing many researchers across the University from interruptions to their work.
Still, some Harvard researchers have not completely avoided the shutdown’s effects.
Jonathan R. Thompson, a senior ecologist at the Harvard Forest who is currently conducting climate change research, said the partial shutdown has prevented him from renewing a long-term research grant from the National Science Foundation — money used to pay staffers’ salaries and keep the lights on in his lab. The shutdown has also halted “rapid” and “supplemental” grants that the Forest uses to fund short-term, time-sensitive research projects and educational ventures, according to Thompson.
“The cost and inefficiencies associated with this are just stunning,” Thompson said. “I understand that people are insecure about where they get their food, so I feel a little bit like I shouldn't be complaining because I can't write my papers and I can't submit my proposals, but it's just, at all levels it's absurd.”
To prevent any gaps in data collection, Thompson’s lab has established an “at-risk” account with the University’s Office for Sponsored Programs to temporarily replace the long-term grant — a setup Thompson described as a loan Harvard researchers can take out from their department if they expect to receive a grant in the near future. Ordinarily, at-risk accounts can remain open for a maximum of 120 days.
“This is a bit uncertain, and I imagine the University is getting quite a lot of requests for this,” Thompson said. “The department assumes the liability if the worst were to happen and it weren't reopened, or the grant were to be cancelled, or something like that.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the shutdown’s impact on researchers.
In total, approximately 9 percent of Harvard’s federal funding came from the NSF in 2017. No new funding opportunities will be available until the shutdown concludes, according to the NSF’s website.
Faculty who plan to request new grants from NSF face similar uncertainty. Human Evolutionary Biology professor Daniel E. Lieberman wrote in an email that he nonetheless plans to submit a grant application to NSF this week.
“Who knows if it will be processed let alone funded?” he wrote.
But gaps in funding are not researchers’ only concerns. Harvard faculty often collaborate on research projects with federal scientists — many of whom are legally prohibited from working on ongoing projects or even checking their emails during the shutdown, according to Thompson.
“They're just not allowed to email anymore, and they're not allowed to participate,” Thompson said. “A lot of research, and papers, and work is just stalled right now.”
Nonetheless, Harvard Forest Senior Ecologist Neil Pederson said some federal scientists have switched email addresses in order to continue working under the radar, despite not receiving pay.
The shutdown has also affected researchers' ability to access information normally available on government websites.
Jacob Barandes, co-director of Graduate Studies for Physics, wrote in an email that thesis writers could not access online databases on the National Institute of Standards and Technology website, which at least one student “needed” for his work.
Pederson said he faces similar challenges as some of the public datasets he and his colleagues use for teaching and research are inaccessible during the shutdown. Data from the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — among others — are currently unavailable online “due to a lapse in appropriation,” according to the agencies’ websites.
Researchers across the University said they worry about further adverse effects on their work if the shutdown continues to drag on.
“Beyond general uncertainty on everything from permits to grants, it hasn’t had too strong an effect yet,” Lieberman wrote. “But that will surely change if it continues.”
He noted that standard interactions with government agencies — such as receiving permits to import specimens — could be disrupted.
“We are in uncharte[d] territory,” he wrote.
CORRECTION: Jan. 19, 2019

The Harvard men’s hockey team defeated a formidable No. 6 Quinnipiac squad on Saturday in its most challenging bout so far this season. Yet, the in-conference victory, while important, may still fail to match the intensity of the Crimson’s upcoming trip: to Lynah Rink this Friday for an energetic battle with No. 15/14 Cornell.
In a raucous atmosphere unlike anything Harvard’s Bright-Landry Hockey Center has to offer, Big Red supporters hurl cheers and fish alike down upon the Crimson icemen. This year’s installment of the annually anticipated rivalry clash promises to deliver yet another spectacle of school spirit and high-quality hockey.
“It’s electric,” said junior defenseman John Marino of the Lynah atmosphere. “You get the fish going, and it’s always cool. It doesn’t matter if you’re a freshman or a senior.”
Cornell (9-5-1, 5-2-1 ECAC) enters the tilt having swept a ranked Arizona St. team last weekend. The Big Red has gone without a loss (4-0-1) in its previous five contests, cementing itself among the nation’s top clubs.
Harvard (7-5-3, 4-4-2) will arrive in Ithaca, N.Y., fresh off its stingy defensive performance against Quinnipiac but with more mixed results prior to that, falling to Princeton and tying Boston University to round out last week’s three-game slate.
The Crimson sits just outside the USCHO top 20 and can quite realistically crack the list with a victory at Cornell’s expense. Harvard has not been ranked since it dropped out of the polls in mid-November of 2017, before which it had remained in the top 20 for 78 straight weeks.
Friday’s Ivy League affair also carries important conference implications. The Crimson, with its .500 conference record, sits sixth among the 12 ECAC teams and can vault the Big Red with a victory. Cornell has two games in-hand on Harvard, though, heading into Friday’s matchup with just eight ECAC games under its belt.
“These next five games are enormous for us,” said co-captain Michael Floodstrand after last Friday’s loss to Princeton. “Guys are going to start realizing that more and more as these weeks come…. It’s a matter of just a few inches in the standings at the end of the year.”
The 2018-2019 campaign has given fans of the Crimson-Big Red rivalry a special treat: over Thanksgiving break, the teams met at the storied Madison Square Garden for the Frozen Apple, an additional non-conference battle. Harvard shone up and down the lineup in Manhattan, nabbing the squads’ first meeting.
Just a week later, Cornell tripped to Cambridge looking to avenge its loss at the Garden. A pair of second-period goals guided the Big Red to victory. Friday’s showdown at Lynah will thus mark the third and final regular season game between the rivals.
“It’s always awesome playing Cornell just because of the huge rivalry,” sophomore forward Henry Bowlby said. “Having an extra game is awesome, and it’ll help us decide the season series.”
In both prior tilts this season, injuries sidelined multiple mainstays in the Cornell lineup. At the Frozen Apple, coach Mike Schafer was without the services of blue-liners Brendan Smith (9 GP, 1–1—2) and Alex Green (3 GP, 0–1—1) as well as forwards Jeff Mallott (10 GP, 1–1—2) and Brenden Locke (10 GP, 2–2—4), all four of which contribute nightly to the team. As their numbers reflect, however, health has hindered their consistency, both in terms of availability and production.
The following week at the Bright, sophomore net-minder Matt Galajda, arguably the team’s most valuable player over the last two seasons, was sidelined. After starting in nine consecutive games to kick off the campaign, Galajda (6-4-0, 2.53 GAA, .891 SV%) missed five contests before returning to the blue paint last Saturday.
In his absence, classmate Austin McGrath (3-1-1, 1.84 GAA, .932 SV%) has put forth stellar numbers, somewhat muddying the starting goaltender situation in Ithaca — this despite a decorated freshman season from Galajda.
“Cornell can talk about [injuries] all they want, but I think they play pretty similarly regardless of whether they’re missing players,” Bowlby said. “It’ll be a battle on Friday…. They play a heavy game. Really strong defensively, and they like to hold onto pucks down low in the offensive zone and make us play defense.”
Regardless of who tends the cage for the Big Red, Harvard’s potent offense will present challenges for Cornell. While the Crimson has struggled to pot the puck after returning from the winter recess, ranking in the bottom third of the NCAA with 2.25 goals per game, its season-long average of 3.27 is good for 13th in the country.
A large contributor to Harvard’s scoring success is its powerplay, which leads the nation at 35.7 percent effective. With the man-up unit averaging well over a goal per game (1.33), powerplay hockey is one of the pillars of this year’s Crimson squad.
Each member of the first extra-man unit adds a unique element to the system. Most notably, the puck moves through junior defenseman Adam Fox (7–16—23), whose ability to slow the game down with the puck on his stick draws attention from penalty killers and allows him to capitalize on his knack for playmaking. Fox sits stop college hockey in powerplay points per game (0.87) and third in the league in overall points per game (1.53).
“When you have [Fox] out there, he makes everything a lot easier,” Marino said. “Our powerplay has been clicking this year, and it’s been great to have that going well for us.”
On the wing, freshman Casey Dornbach (3–17—20) plays the role of set-up man, leading the NCAA in powerplay and overall assists per game (0.73 and 1.13, respectively). Fellow rookie Jack Drury (5–10—15) wins the majority of offensive-zone draws and creates traffic in front of the opposing goaltender.
At the point opposite Fox, sophomore blue-liner Reilly Walsh (5–9—14) has used his lethal point shot to score all five of his goals with the man advantage. Co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage (10–3—13) dwells in the high slot ready to unleash one-timers of his own or pick up loose pucks in front of the net. The second powerplay unit also pitches in, as it did in Saturday’s close victory over Quinnipiac, courtesy of Marino’s bomb from the point.
Even though Cornell has traditionally played a defense-first, goaltender-friendly style, Crimson backstop Michael Lackey (7-4-3, 2.32 GAA, .920 SV%) has also posted sturdy numbers. Especially of late, Lackey’s surge combined with a stronger commitment to team defense — initially a struggle for the squad — has changed the complexion of this year’s Harvard team.
“As we’re kind of getting underway in the season…everyone is starting to understand their role,” Marino said. “Lackey has obviously been playing great for us, and all the D have been really buying in. Everyone’s been a lot more conservative lately, and the D have just stepped up, and it’s shown.”
A 110-year-old rivalry, crucial conference points on the line, one of college hockey’s most electric barns, a stellar powerplay clashing with notoriously stingy team defense, and a deluge of fish — whatever the storyline, the annual Harvard-Cornell battle at Lynah Rink has something for everyone. This year’s matchup will offer it all.
