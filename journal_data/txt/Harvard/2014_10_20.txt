After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On his second solo album, “Trick,” Kele Okereke has turned further away from his days of angsty punk rock and heavy lyrics in favor of beats and house music. The British singer continues to explore his artistic talents as a DJ while Bloc Party, of which he is former frontman and rhythm guitarist, is on their second hiatus. Dropping his surname for his solo career, Kele has produced a carefully balanced mixture of soulful rhythms and electronic beats to complement his profound lyrics on an eclectic but sometimes-inconsistent album.
Kele’s determination to create a sound that transcends a single genre and spans across the spectrum of his experiences comes through once more in “Trick.” A supporter of the notion that change is necessary to give art its purpose, Kele unsurprisingly pushes the boundaries and blends different influences to create an altogether new and unique sound. “Trick,” which Kele originally began recording in 2012 while still touring with Bloc Party, integrates diverse styles in a welcome and smooth manner that feels fresh and interesting.
This diversity appears most obviously in Kele’s vocal delivery. The juxtaposition of ethereal backing vocals and Kele’s heavily concentrated vocals submits listeners to a diverse, captivating, and sometimes overwhelming combination of sensations and sounds. Throughout the album, Kele cultivates his vocal performance by blending genres and creating a new experience altogether that no individual sect of music generates.
A gay, black man coming from what he describes as a conservative and unwelcoming atmosphere of indie rock, Kele has decided to move in a completely different direction towards the more comfortable genre of house music. The accepting environment of the electronic music scene was the stimulus for Kele’s creation of “Trick” as an album of confessions on which he is able to express his individual pursuits and passions while also bringing to light his own experiences from which he was once sheltered.
Personal expressions, such as yearning for another and a sense of loneliness or loss, are prevalent on “Trick.” “Coasting” uses the beat to simulate the falling and floating sensation of infatuation, supported by lyrics that lay the groundwork for the beginning of an intense love. An empowering message of how love gives strength, “Doubt” is a more commanding track delivered by Kele’s confident and strong vocals, and the heavier beat is easy to follow. That longing for reciprocated affection and physical presence of a former lover is explored in “Closer,” which alternates between upbeat pop and smooth R&B, flattering the tone of the lyrics. This synergy carries through in “Like We Used to,” where Kele’s ethereal vocals paired with the thumping beat gives a sensual tone to his nostalgic lyricism, reminiscent of better times in a relationship. The tracks on “Trick” serve to create a cohesive storyline, and Kele is able to recreate the expanse of a relationship to the listener.
The intimate tone and content of “Trick” help create a smooth and rhythmic dance feel that is supported by a subdued balance between hyped-up beats and catchy lyrics. His lyricism and rhythm become repetitive at several points on the album, but this repetition serves the purpose of keeping the listener engaged and the beat danceable. The lengthy pauses that appear in all the tracks can add to the atmosphere that Kele creates, but sometimes the stark contrast between light and heavy beats begins to bore and become distracting.
Indeed, the content of “Trick” feels disjointed at times, as the tracks waver between deep, unobtrusive expressions of loneliness and longing and choppy compositions that feel trapped between fast beats and slow vocals. “Silver and Gold” is marred by clipped sounds and off-putting interjections that detract from the deep and confident expressions Kele conveys through his vocals and lyrics. While the track pulls you in, it also introduces a stumbling, disconcerting beat that seems to trip over itself. The same disoriented feeling from these out-of-place sounds laid over the music are seen in “Doubt,” again detracting from Kele’s powerful lyrics and vocals.
But the real strength of “Trick” is individuality. Kele has allowed each track to stand on its own, though within each song is ample repetition. However, it is impressive that “Trick” is able to get across an emotional message while still flowing to a beat that, for the most part, complements the vocals. When listening to “Trick,” it is obvious that the album is intended to be danced to, but Kele does not let the album’s energy consume its purpose, giving each track a meaning that is apparent upon closer listening but not too complicated to be uninviting. Kele’s talent has proved itself again, combining original and ingenious blends of genres to make his own unique piece.

To the editor:
Your article about Monday’s faculty discussion with William Deresiewicz—“In Heated Discussion, ‘Excellent Sheep’ Author Fields Criticism from Faculty, Students”—presents the conduct of some of our faculty and administrators toward Dr. Deresiewicz as fair contributions to a reasonable discussion; in fact, they were often unworthy of our values.
As the article reports, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana asked Deresiewicz what he “[missed] most about being an academic.” The article doesn’t put the question in context. Deresiewicz is no longer an academic because Yale denied him tenure. Dean Khurana could only have mocked a peer more uncharitably if he had asked his predecesor, Professor Evelynn Hammonds, what she missed most about being a dean.
Consider the article’s statement that one of Deresiewicz’s remarks “elicit[ed] a response” from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who spoke “when the audience was given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.” That’s true, but it elides this: When the moderator asked the audience for questions—which, as I understand them, typically end in question marks and ask something—Dean Smith, one of our university’s highest academic administrators, made a polemical statement instead.
Moreover, the article omits the most disingenuous maneuver of the evening. In an attempt to set up a “gotcha” moment, Professor Diana Sorenson asked Deresiewicz why he thought students shouldn’t do internships. When Deresiewicz said he didn’t hold that view, Sorenson dramatically opened his book and read a line which seemed to confirm her account of his position—eliciting raucous laughter and applause from the crowd. Stunned, Deresiewicz asked her to read the entire paragraph the line came from, insisting that in context, the sentence in question addressed only students taking a gap year. Sorenson declined, and Deresiewicz was denied a chance to defend himself.
As a student, I’m embarrassed that administrators and faculty members would violate the basic norms of a panel discussion in order to score points against a thoughtful critic. In framing what happened as part of a constructive but “heated” discussion, the article legitimizes conduct that undermines our values and shields it from deserved scrutiny.
As a community ostensibly committed to reflection, dialogue, and the values that sustain them, we only do ourselves a disservice when we treat those we disagree with so unfairly—not to mention confirm some of Deresiewicz’s most biting critiques of who we are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Friday evening in 1944, in a small South Carolina town, George Junius Stinney Jr. was on his way to the execution chamber with a bible tucked under his arm. Even after using the book as a booster seat, the boy—who stood just over five feet tall and weighed 95 pounds—did not fit in the electric chair. The adult-sized facemask dangled loosely on his face. At 14 years of age, this black child became the youngest person to be legally executed by an American state since the 1800s.
Recently unearthed evidence suggests that Stinney was innocent. This evidence has come 70 years too late.
The tragic, legal lynching of George Stinney, Jr., illustrates how government-sanctioned death is morally incompatible with our less-than-perfect justice system.
The advent of DNA evidence gave way to a series of exonerations for wrongful convictions, beginning in 1989. Since that time, there have been 1,408 total exonerations for wrongly convicted persons, including 106 exonerations of individuals sentenced to death. Kirk Bloodsworth was the first death-row inmate to be exonerated by DNA evidence in the United States. He had been accused and convicted of a rape-murder he did not commit. Glenn Ford spent 30 years in prison for a murder he did not commit before DNA evidence made him the most recent death-row inmate to be exonerated in the United States.
If there is anything to learn from these heartbreaking stories of wrongful convictions, it is that an imperfect justice system makes capital punishment impossible to justify. Those 106 exonerated death row inmates were fortunate to have had science on their side and diligent defense attorneys and judges willing to reopen their cases to find the truth. For every Bloodsworth and Ford who now walks the streets, there are untold numbers of innocent others who remain on death row—or worse, who are dead because the death penalty is still constitutional in the United States.
The death penalty is a vestige of an ugly past that says the harshest penalty is ultimately what deters crime, even though current evidence about its effectiveness as a deterrent is inconclusive at best.
Yes, the death penalty is reserved for the most serious of crimes. And yes, it takes many years for a death sentence to be carried out, after the entire appeals process has been exhausted. But that doesn’t resolve the most serious concern that government-approved death raises. Unlike a life sentence, where the opportunity for that individual to prove his or her own innocence still exists even after the last appeal, death is final. To sentence someone to death is to say that this individual no longer has the right to prove his or her innocence. For such a practice to have democratic legitimacy, the legal system must be able to determine guilt with absolute precision.
Our legal system does not fit the bill. It is too often inaccurate and unfair. Too many individuals have already been exonerated from sentences that carried capital punishment and too many people of color have been treated unequally at every step of the legal process for us as a country to rest easy as states around the country continue to carry out executions.
The United States is the only country in the Western Hemisphere that still permits capital punishment. The 43 executions that were carried out in the U.S. in 2012 puts us in a company that is only surpassed by China, Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. These are facts that should frighten us all. If we wish to consider our country the leader of the free world, then it is imperative that we reexamine our practices at home. As long as the death penalty remains constitutional in the United States, justice will remain in peril.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, 28 law professors drawn from a wide range of legal disciplines, including legal philosophy, constitutional law, and civil rights, published a letter criticizing the university's newly revised sexual harassment and sexual assault policy. The letter listed several grievances with the new policy, but the brunt of the criticism rested on two claims—that the new policy unfairly infringes on the rights of the accused, and that the way the policy was implemented “violates ... traditions of academic freedom and faculty governance.” While neither of these complaints can be brusquely dismissed, the first merits significantly more credence than the second. Further, given universities’ troubled history in dealing with cases of sexual assault, we disagree with the letter's assertion that the new policy "will do more harm than good."
On the spectrum of issues that are important for the faculty of Harvard Law School have control of in order to defend academic freedom, sexual harassment policy certainly ranks low. Sexual harassment policy is not a matter of curriculum or freedom of opinion. This change in policy will have no effect on any of the signed professors' abilities to publish, teach, or even to contribute to the discourse on sexual harassment policy. Perhaps the professors are correct in saying that this policy takes away a right to determine discipline traditionally maintained by the faculty, but tradition has not been a particular just arbiter for victims of sexual assault.
The letter makes no direct mention of the "preponderance of evidence" standard that the new policy has instituted, which is preferred by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and a step in the right direction from the "sufficiently persuaded" standard employed earlier. Instead the letter chooses to focus on how Harvard's new policy exceeds Title IX requirements, and how going beyond the minimum requirements somehow means that the university is failing to “stand up.”
The letter's concerns with the centralization of authority to process sexual harassment claims into the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution and with the issue of the rights of representation for the accused are also substantial. The ODR will be composed of "trained investigators," and though it is true that this is not an independent authority, it is still an improvement over a system in which the Ad Board, a body not required in any substantive way to have expertise in sensitive issues like sexual harassment, had control over the hearing and judgment of such cases. The ODR might not be an ideal solution, but the idea that it will become a facilitator of false accusation and unjust sentencing seems farfetched.
If Harvard is to extend larger rights of representation for the accused, the authors of the letter point to an important point that requires clarification. In the rare case of a false accusation, it would be horrible to see a student unable to defend him or herself because of inability to afford adequate representation. Financial means, or even legal savvy or acumen, should not privilege one student over another in these cases. But it is still distorting to argue that the need for clarification here spoils the new policy in its entirety.
The authors of the letter are correct in saying that Harvard University must “stand up for principle.” But the principle it must stand for is justice for the victims of sexual harassment and assault. The new policy is not perfect. But even accounting for the letter's legitimate grievances, it absolutely does more good than harm.

There are three sure ways to get into Harvard:
The first one is fairly easy. Just open up a lemonade stand. Then, turn that lemonade stand into a multinational corporation that rakes in bank for your CEO mother or father. If there’s enough potential for Harvard to get a lot of money in donations, admittance is assured. But that’s a bit difficult for some people, for some reason.
The third one is really easy. You just have to write an essay about how you were raised by a chicken.  Your story of somehow maintaining your GPA while defending your mother from hungry farmers would be inspiring to any admissions officer.
But a lot of people don’t do that, for some reason. So that leaves most of us with the second one: Do a crazy amount of extracurricular activities. And this, sadly, is what most people who come here do.
That shouldn’t be sad. But it is. And here’s why:
Doing a ridiculous amount of extracurriculars in high school is rewarded by admission to college. It’s the formula for success. So, when people come here, that formula is what they know, and they implement it. A trend arises: As admission becomes tougher and requires more extracurricular work, students in college continue the habit of taking on more and more extracurriculars. The result is that whenever I try to set up lunch with someone, our Google calendars only match up for one 30-minute slot in December; that is, only if my chicken mother doesn’t visit town that day. And we’re stressed out and haven’t done a lot of the reading for that one easy Gen-Ed course with a midterm the following day.
Don’t get me wrong. I’d hate to be on a campus where every student is literally just a student, without an interest beyond his or her major.  But there’s a point where extracurriculars go too far.
The evidence isn’t only anecdotal. In an email sent out by Dean Rakesh Khurana in September, he cited that “the fraction of seniors who report spending less than six hours a week on (extracurricular) activities has decreased from 49 percent in 2010 to 31 percent in 2013. The fraction of students spending more than 10 hours per week has increased from 27 percent to 43 percent.” If more students now are spending upwards of 10 hours a week on extracurricular activities, that means one of two things: Either they are spending less time on their academic work. Or they are keeping up with academics and more extracurriculars, resulting in less downtime.
Neither option seems good. At the end of the day, we grow more from getting our papers read by world-class professors rather than getting our articles read by some senior in Lowell who edits a campus publication, or by dancing on a team, or by playing an instrument on a student orchestra. Sure, at least part of the value of our education is being able to explore other interests with our talented peers; but the foundation for it all must be our education.
The second option—that students are keeping up with academics at the same time as increasing their extracurriculars—suggests that students are working more overall and have less downtime. Of course, Harvard has had constant struggles with mental health in recent years, and decreasing recreational time only adds to the stressful atmosphere.
But here’s my question with all this: why? Will a law school care if I participated in certain play? Will an employer care if I went to a PBHA event? Will anyone ever care about this column? (Please? Somebody? Anybody?)
They may, a bit. But, unlike the admissions office here, it won’t be a determining factor.
So there’s a problem: Students divide themselves between too many activities. It’s unnecessary and it’s costly. And it’s hard-wired in freshmen through the admissions process.
However, there seems to be a simple solution. And thankfully, our new dean seems to get it. At convocation, Dean Khurana said to freshmen, “Now that you are here, you may feel that you are expected to do high school all over again, to jump through a series of hoops and prove yourself. But one of the most important things that I want to tell you today is that you don’t.”
We need to make this message more clear, precise, and explicit in terms of extracurriculars for freshman. We need to have an Opening Days session, much like community conversations, where a discussion leader drills the point home that the students won’t be standouts by doing 1,000 things on campus. They’re at Harvard: They’re already standouts. And loading up on too much will only lessen their well-earned, standout experience at the school. It’s not only unnecessary—it’s counterproductive. And students should fully enjoy and utilize the privilege of coming here.
Only by working to reverse-engineer a cutthroat admissions process can we tackle mental health issues and improve the academic environment on campus. Once we make it clear to freshmen that they need a mentality shift for college, they will respond. And only then will students be able to enjoy their time here. Otherwise, they’ll continue acting like my late mother: running around like a chicken with its head cut off.

The Harvard Graduate School of Education hosted a preview last week of an upcoming media campaign that aims to encourage young undocumented immigrants to pursue their educational goals and includes contributions from Harvard students and faculty. The preview event, which took place Friday in Askwith Hall, came three days after an undocumented Harvard student was granted a humanitarian visa to return to the United States from Mexico.
The national campaign, led by the Televisa Foundation, intends to raise awareness about the government’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which enables some undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. at an early age to avoid deportation and obtain work authorization. The campaign will publicize the stories of several DACA beneficiaries through a series of short videos, some of which will air on Univision starting in late November. The videos will initially be made available in English, Spanish, and Chinese.
Among those who spoke at the event were GSE Dean James E. Ryan, education professor Roberto G. Gonzales, Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition Executive Director Eva. A. Millona, United We Dream co-founder Cristina Jimenez, and TheDream.US Program Director Gaby Pacheco.
Ryan gave introductory remarks at the event, speaking of the larger ideals motivating both the Ed School and the “Think About It” campaign.
“The fundamental belief that motivates the work of all of us here,” he said, “is the belief that all children, regardless of the color of their skin, who their parents are, where they live, are entitled to and deserve a high-quality education.”
Though far from perfect, he added, DACA has offered “significant” opportunities to undocumented immigrants and has freed many from the “legal limbo” that came after Plyler v. Doe, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that undocumented immigrants were able to go to school but were unable to gain access to work, driver's licenses, healthcare, and higher education.
The other speakers at the preview concurred with Ryan, discussing the potential of DACA and the extraordinary change it has enabled. But each speaker also acknowledged that immigration policy and DACA implementation had plenty of room for improvement.
“DACA is a band-aid solution,” Millona said. “It’s not the solution we’d like to see.”
Millona said she was hopeful, however, that a more permanent solution, such as the passage of the DREAM Act, would come soon. “It’s a matter of time, it’s a matter of when, it’s not a matter of if,” she said.
Jimenez said she agreed with Millona and highlighted the fact that around 400,000 individuals eligible for DACA have yet to apply. Moreover, she estimated that there are an additional 400,000 individuals who could be made eligible for DACA if they obtain a high school diploma or the equivalent.
Also present at the event were several of the students profiled in the campaign videos, who shared their stories and their rationale for joining the campaign.
“Growing up as a dreamer, as undocumented really, there’s a point where you kind of  hide yourself because you’re scared of what can happen—you being deported, your parents being deported,” said Sandra Y. Sandoval, an immigration activist featured in the campaign. “But you can’t always live in fear—if anything, you should use your story and your experience to help other people.”
Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco ’15, who also stressed the possibilities provided by DACA, was profiled in the videos as well.
“The epitome of the ‘American dream’ is attending Harvard,” she said. “I wanted to be a part of this campaign to show people that it is possible to attend an elite university, even if you’re undocumented.”

Although Nigeria leads Africa in oil exports, two recent Harvard graduates are trying to ramp up the West African country’s production of a different natural resource—tomato paste.
“It was a pipe dream I’ve had since 2008,” said Mira A. Mehta, a Business School graduate who co-founded the startup “Tomato Jos” with School of Public Health alumnus Shane F. Kiernan earlier this year. The company, a for-profit social enterprise, aims to build up a tomato paste industry in Nigeria by educating local tomato farmers about agricultural techniques and supplying them with seeds and fertilizers. The name Tomato Jos itself means “cute girl” in Nigerian slang, a play on the fact that the tomatoes in the Nigerian city Jos are known to be very sweet and juicy.
Mehta said the inspiration for the startup came from the four years she spent living in Nigeria before attending HBS. “We would pass miles and miles of tomato fields, and the tomatoes were just rotting on the side of the road,” Mehta said. “It’s a striking image.”
According to Mehta, tomatoes are a staple in many Nigerian dishes, but the poor quality of locally grown crops, combined with a weak transportation infrastructure, causes the country to import almost $500 million in tomato paste every year.
To help reverse this trend, Mehta and Kiernan designed their startup with a business model that oversees tomato paste production from seed to shelf.  After ensuring that local farmers produce a high-quality crop, Mehta said, Tomato Jos will manage transportation of the tomatoes to local factories where they can then be processed into paste and packaged under the Tomato Jos brand.
Mehta began the research that informed this business model during her last year at the Business School, and in January 2014, she teamed up with Kiernan, whom she first met while living in Africa.
“I knew that this opportunity could really have a transformational impact on the lives of smallholder farmers in Nigeria,” Kiernan wrote in an email. “From my experience it is trade and not aid that ultimately leads to the greatest positive social impact.”
After Tomato Jos placed as runner-up in the 2014 Harvard Business School New Venture Competition, it was accepted into the Harvard Innovation Lab’s Venture Incubation Program. Then, Mehta and Kiernan spent the summer in Nigeria, doing groundwork to prepare for the startup’s launch.
“There are so many challenges to operate a startup, but it is particularly unique to have your operations outside of the country,” said Matthew C. Guidarelli, an assistant director at the i-Lab who served as a mentor for the Tomato Jos team. “You have to understand the political landscape, the local customs and behaviors, and the market.”
Currently, Kiernan is back in Nigeria, breaking ground on a greenhouse and assembling a group of small farmers to join the trial, set to start in a few weeks. Mehta, who is currently fundraising for the startup in the U.S., said that the team may someday consider expanding beyond tomatoes once their model has gained traction.
“I feel really strongly about Mira and Shane’s ability to realize the results they want,” Guidarelli said. “There is a lot of potential for Tomato Jos to not only have an impact in Nigeria, but create a model for other social enterprises to learn from.”

Jill E. Abramson ’76, former executive editor of The New York Times, encouraged young women to persevere through setbacks in their personal and professional lives during her keynote speech at the Intercollegiate Business Convention at Hynes Convention Center Saturday.
“The main point I’m getting at here,” Abramson said, “is that women are damn resilient.”
Abramson was fired from her post at the Times last spring and now teaches in the English Department at Harvard. She has previously taught at Yale and Princeton and worked for publications such as Time Magazine, The American Lawyer, and The Wall Street Journal.
In her speech Saturday, Abramson paid homage to the women, such as veteran journalists Sandra Burton and Nan C. Robertson, who mentored and inspired her throughout her career.
When speaking about Burton, Abramson said, “Sandy kept pushing on doors, however firmly closed they were.” Burton, who was initially hired as a secretary, climbed the ranks at Time Magazine to become one of the first female correspondents for the magazine. She worked at the helm of the Boston bureau of Time while Abramson worked there.
Abramson also discussed Doris Kearns Goodwin, who was one of the first women to become a full Harvard professor when she received tenure in 1975 at age 31. Abramson applauded Goodwin for her resilience when the professor was stripped of tenure after a “silly dispute” with her publisher.
“That experience could have crushed her, but she went on to publish her book and many more. One of which, ‘No Ordinary Time,' won the Pulitzer Prize,” Abramson said.
Abramson also noted the efforts of women who are still active and ambitious in their careers to this day, such as politician Hillary Clinton and University President Drew G. Faust.
“I can definitely see how [Abramson] accomplished what she did now. She gets her message across very strongly,” said Jane Z. Chen ’17, a member of Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business and an organizer of the event. “Resilience is an important message to pass on to others.”
Abramson also encouraged attendees to create and foster female support networks. That message rang true for Camila L. Rey ’17.
“Women also need to support each other,” she said.
When asked about her legacy, Abramson said that she not only wants to be remembered for her work as a journalist and efforts to break down gender barriers, but also for her personal and family life. She said that she plans to continue teaching at the College, writing, and hopefully have grandchildren.
The convention, which was hosted by Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, attracted over 1,200 attendees and also featured career fairs, networking sessions, and seminars in which participants learned various business techniques. Maureen Chiquet, chief executive officer of Chanel, and Lyndsey Scott, a model who has launched an effort to encourage more women to learn coding, also delivered keynote speeches.
Conference participants noted that Women in Business has made an effort to invite strong female role models to speak at its events.
“We try to promote female empowerment and equality in the workplace, especially in fields like finance and consulting, that are extremely male-dominated,” Chen said.

UPDATED: October 20, 2014, at 5:35 p.m.
Harvard’s Institute of Politics announced Thursday that it would partner with three prominent think tanks to host the 21st Bipartisan Program for Newly Elected Members of Congress, a biennial conference to prepare new members of the House of Representatives for their duties on Capitol Hill.
The IOP hosts the conference every two years to help educate participants, elected in November, on public policy and the day-to-day issues of being a member of Congress. Founded in 1972, the conference has helped educate and prepare almost 700 representatives.
This year, the IOP will work with the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in addition to its previous partner, the Congressional Institute, to design a curriculum for the conference.
The political ideologies of the selected think tanks range from liberal to conservative. The think tanks were chosen to appeal to congressional representatives from both sides of the aisle, according to Christian B. Flynn, director of conferences and special projects at the IOP.
“We were thinking about this program and what the new members wanted to learn and who they wanted to hear from,” Flynn said.
The conference typically attracts a majority of incoming members, but this year, Flynn said he hopes to try and ensure that all of the new members to attend.
“We really want us to be seen as the program that every [newly elected] member of Congress should come to,” Flynn said. “I just feel like these organizations bring a lot of credibility.”
Undergraduate members of the IOP will help prepare for the conference.
“The undergraduates primarily work to encourage congressmen to come,” said Kim F. Soffen ’16, chair of the IOP Special Events Committee, which helps coordinate the conference. “We look for undergraduates who are in their constituency and have them reach out.”
This year’s program is set to take place from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5.

The Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality unanimously endorsed the Harvard Teaching Campaign last Thursday, becoming the fifth department or committee to extend its support of the movement of teaching fellows that aims to improve the undergraduate educational experience by urging the University to adopt a 12-student cap on section and lab group sizes.
The Campaign’s cause has been endorsed by the Philosophy, History, Sociology, and English Departments, as well as by the Undergraduate Council and the Graduate Student Council.
Department Chair Alice A. Jardine said that even though Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality is a small program, it places much value on the quality of its undergraduate education.
“WGS is fully in support of the effort to provide smaller learning environments for our undergraduates and to offer graduate students a more reasonable workload, which in turn will maximize both their efficacy as teachers and their productivity as scholars,” Jardine wrote in an email.
In an effort to broaden its support base among undergraduates, the Campaign held a planning meeting last Thursday in Quincy Senior Common Room, where around 15 undergraduates joined in a discussion on the Campaign's next steps.
Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a History teaching fellow who is leading the campaign’s outreach effort to undergraduates, said she finds it surprising that the University does not commit more resources to reducing section sizes.
Groeger said that during the financial downturn in 2008, the University justified increased section sizes with financial concerns, which are less relevant today.
“We don’t have that excuse anymore,” she said. “Now is a really good time to make this a priority.”
Undergraduate Council Education Committee chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 was also present at the meeting.
“The entire Council is behind this project,” Dhruv said, adding that the UC endorsed the Campaign last spring.
Even though most of the support received by the Campaign has come from the humanities departments, campaign members said that decreasing the size of lab groups is also part of the campaign, and more efforts will be made to reach out to departments in the sciences.
Luis A. Perez ’16 is one of the organizers of the developing undergraduate wing of the Campaign, which at least five students have volunteered to join.
Perez said he was motivated to join the Campaign after finding himself in large sections for his General Education classes, in which he said he could hardly engage in meaningful discussions.
“There are just too many people for me to be able to comfortably voice my opinion without feeling I’m shutting somebody else up,” Perez said. “I want to make sure that Harvard stays true to their goal of educating future leaders of this world.... I feel that they are lagging behind in that aspect.”
According to Perez, the undergraduate wing of the Campaign will work to increase students’ awareness on the importance of smaller sections, and it plans to petition to submit a question on section size for a UC referendum in the fall election so that students can vote on the issue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 20, 2014, at 2:45 a.m.
Harvard affiliates wishing to travel on University business to the countries most affected by Ebola must now obtain the approval of University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and their respective School dean, according to a new set of guidelines the University disseminated on Friday.
Unrelated to that approval process, the new policy also mandates that any Harvard affiliate returning from Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia must complete a medical screening with Harvard University Health Services before arriving on campus. Travelers could also be asked to stay away from campus for 21 days, the length of the virus’s incubation period.
The guidelines, outlined in an email from Garber and UHS Director Paul J. Barreira, expand on those detailed in August that asked for Harvard students, faculty, and staff to avoid nonessential travel to the three countries.
In an interview Friday, University President Drew G. Faust added that UHS is also undertaking a set of planning exercises to prepare for a case of Ebola at the University, training staff so that they can properly respond and recognize the disease.
“The CDC is working out its procedures, the President’s sitting in the White House trying to figure out what the next steps are, so we’re all very eager to do the right thing and define the parameters of our engagement,” Faust said.
She added that Harvard researchers, particularly those working in public health, have the potential to play a large role in addressing the outbreak.
Still, Harvard’s latest round of efforts to head off the epidemic for affiliates comes with the acknowledgement that the social, political, and medical climate in the region may make it difficult for the University to aid individuals once they are there.
“To contribute effectively in-country entails great personal risk and requires complex logistical support, which only a few aid organizations and governments are capable of providing. Only clinicians with the highest level of readiness—personal, mental, and professional—should even consider traveling,” the guidelines from Harvard Global Support Services read.
In a section specifically targeted at sponsored affiliates in the region, the guidelines state, “Harvard’s ability to help you in an emergency is very limited at best.”
Inquiries to University officials regarding the number of affiliates on the ground in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia were not immediately answered.
In one high-profile case, University Professor Paul E. Farmer and associate professor of medicine Joia Mukherjee travelled to Liberia in mid-September to assess conditions on the ground. They met with Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a 1971 Kennedy School alumna.
Both were working in their capacity as leaders of the global health organization Partners in Health and were not sponsored by Harvard. Farmer did however participate in a Harvard global health event via video from Monrovia, Liberia.
Garber and Barreira wrote on Friday that the University has not identified any University affiliate or campus visitor who has been deemed to be at elevated risk for Ebola to date.
The updated policy comes as tests of a Yale graduate student suspected of having contracted Ebola came back negative last week. The patient recently returned from researching the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and was admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital with “Ebola-like symptoms” on Wednesday night.

Raunak, a show hosted by the South Asian Dance Company, brought together student dancers from several colleges in a performance showcasing South Asian cultural diversity on Saturday night.
The show, which is in its thirteenth year, featured not only Harvard dance groups like Harvard TAPS, Harvard Bhangra, and Harvard Breakers, but also groups from schools all over New England. Participating universities included MIT, Brown, Tufts, Columbia, Yale, Dartmouth, Boston College, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
SADC, a co-ed dance team at Harvard, is currently comprised of 20 undergraduates ranging from freshmen to seniors.
This year, in addition to the traditional intercollegiate dance-off, Raunak’s program also included a breakdance battle, an improvisational Bollywood dance-off between audience members, and a surprise award presentation for the director of the show.
Students involved in the show said that Raunak provides a chance for students of South Asian descent to come together and an opportunity for all students to experience a taste of South Asian music and dance.
To SADC captain and Raunak director Anumita Das ’16, the spirit of Raunak is encapsulated in the performance itself.
“In Sanskrit, Raunak means ‘light’ or ‘illumination,’” Das said. “And this is exactly what the teams are doing—lighting up the stage with their different and wonderful styles of dance.”
The set list is not restricted to classical dance. Raunak features all styles—Bollywood, classical, even hip-hop and fusion—and is meant to be a reflection of the diversity of dance.
“There are two main things that drive Raunak. One is the capacity to show the wide range of emotions that can be expressed and experienced through South Asian dance. The other is this sense of triumph and joy in coming together,” SADC Social Chair Siddhartha G. Jena ’16 said. “Raunak is a celebration of South Asian culture and dance that embodies our community.”
For Das, who agreed with Jena, Raunak is a unique way to demonstrate the diversity of South Asian culture.
“Raunak serves as a forum for intercollegiate dialogue pertaining to the South Asian culture,” Das said.
Das has served as the director of Raunak for the past two years.
“There is no more wonderful feeling than seeing all of your hard work coming together. Seeing everyone smiling, having fun, and connecting through dance is the best,” she said.
Students said they appreciated the fact that many schools get to perform together at the event.
“It’s really cool to meet people through dance. I’ve met enough people over the years that I know a few people on each team,” Jena said.
“The best part is that everyone’s excited about the same thing: dancing together,” UMass Amherst student and Dhadak team captain Pernashee Dave said when asked about her favorite part of Raunak.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is likely to adopt a new concentration in “Theater, Dance, and Media” to begin enrolling undergraduates in fall 2015, University officials announced on Monday.
The proposed concentration, which will require FAS approval following a curricular review, will launch thanks to $5 million of seed funding provided by University President Drew G. Faust from her discretionary funds.
Faust said in an interview Friday that the sum was made possible by The Harvard Campaign and will support the concentration for its first five years. She added that she was confident that donors will contribute subsequent funding to ensure that the concentration is sustained permanently.
Faculty members from the English and Comparative Literature Departments as well as Artistic Director of the American Repertory Theater Diane M. Paulus ’87-’88 and Dance Director Jill Johnson spearheaded the design of the proposed concentration. English professor Martin Puchner formally proposed the concentration based on recommendations from the University-wide Task Force on the Arts and its subsidiary group, the Harvard University Committee on the Arts. The groups were convened in 2007 and 2009, respectively.
Faust said that student demand and demonstrated interest in the arts were primary factors in deciding to create the concentration.
“I didn’t want to wait any longer to get it started because I think there’s such a demand for the kind of program like this,” Faust said. “We have so many students who are active in the arts and are trying to figure out how to make that a core part of their experience, and this does that.”
If Theater, Dance, and Media is approved, undergraduates will be able to declare the concentration starting in Dec. 2015. The concentration’s courses will be available for enrollment earlier, at the beginning of the fall semester next year.
Neither Faust nor the University’s formal announcement detailed the concentration’s requirements or its administration. Existing faculty members, including Paulus, from across FAS departments will serve as the concentration’s primary instructional staff.
Though the proposed concentration is primarily aimed at satisfying student interest, Faust said Friday that she thinks faculty will also benefit from its interdisciplinary structure.
“[Puchner] sees it as really valuable for faculty, too, as they can reach out beyond their speciality to integrate these various dimensions of important work,” Faust said.
Diana Sorensen, dean of the Arts and Humanities Division, said the proposed concentration is a perfect addition for Harvard.
“Three features of the performing arts—their composite, multi-media nature; the importance of historical appropriation; and their inherently collaborative process—make the concentration in theater, dance and media a quintessential liberal art that Harvard is uniquely positioned to teach,” Sorensen said in a press release.
The proposed concentration is not entirely without precedent. Undergraduates may currently declare a secondary field in dramatic arts.
If the concentration is approved, Harvard will be the seventh college in the Ivy League to offer a primary degree program in theater. Yale, Brown, Penn, Dartmouth, Columbia, and Cornell all currently offer some combination of majors in the field of theater or drama.
Princeton will remain the only Ivy League college without a theater major, although it does offer a certificate in theater.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a meeting with University President Drew G. Faust last week, Undergraduate Council leaders are moving forward with plans to better include student voice in administrative and faculty decisions.
On Friday, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15 sat down with Faust to share grievances they have vocally levelled against administrators relating to the inclusion of student voice in recent policy changes. Among the changes in which Mayopoulos contends students were not involved are the University’s new sexual harassment policy and the removal of difficulty ratings from the Q Guide.
The tone of the meeting differed markedly from Council leaders’ February meeting with Faust, in which they demanded an additional $250,000 in funding for the Council and hosted a large rally outside Massachusetts Hall.
Mayopoulos said that on Friday Faust expressed a “strong interest” in many of the Council’s ideas to include student input in Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ decisions, including the ability for the Council to submit amicus-style briefs before items on the Faculty Council’s agenda come to a vote.
Mayopoulos added that Faust guaranteed that undergraduates will serve on an upcoming committee to review the University’s sexual harassment policy, which was adopted this summer.
“I think we both left the meeting feeling very much that President Faust was on our side and very enthusiastic about some of our proposed ideas,” Goffard said in an interview on Saturday.
The UC leaders said they plan to meet with FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in the coming weeks in an attempt to formalize their goals.
The recent emphasis on student voice by Mayopoulos and Goffard marks a strong shift for the Council, which had previously prioritized increasing funding for student groups over other initiatives.
WEEKLY MEETING
Mayopoulos and Goffard summarized their efforts to the full Undergraduate Council at its general meeting on Sunday, before moving on to other legislation meant to show support for gender and racial diversity.
The Council also allocated time to review and explicate internal rules on Council procedures. Parliamentarian William Oh '18 clarified procedures for legislation to Council representatives who, in recent weeks, have expressed confusion about the process.
In measures meant to support gender and racial diversity groups, the Council voted to sponsor the United Nation’s HeForShe campaign and to express solidarity with members of the Harvard community affected by recent death threats sent to undergraduates, many of whom are female and of Asian descent.
Representatives amended legislation to both criticize the University for what they wrote was a “delayed response from administrators,” while at the same time expressing regret that the Council itself had not responded promptly to the threats. The Harvard University Police Department ultimately concluded those emails posed no threat.
The Council also passed legislation approving the Student Initiative Committee’s budget and passed another wave of general grants totaling about $9,400.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After completing a road sweep in New York last weekend, the Harvard women’s volleyball team brought that momentum back to Cambridge. The squad downed Penn in come-from-behind fashion and handled Princeton easily at the Malkin Athletic Center, extending its winning streak to four heading into the second cycle of Ivy League play.
“Our juniors and seniors have invested a lot of energy,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “And I think that was evident in our week of preparation.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
After getting off to a slow start on Friday, the Crimson (12-4, 5-2 Ivy) made sure to attack Princeton (9-8, 4-3) early and often on Saturday. Harvard jumped out to a commanding 16-6 lead in the second set, propelled by co-captain Caroline Walters, who led the attack with 11 kills. Junior Caroline Holte also added nine of her own.
The Crimson faced more resistance in the third and final set of the match. The Tigers held the lead for the majority of the frame. But trailing 20-18, the Crimson won seven of the next eight points to finish the weekend undefeated.
The first set saw Princeton and Harvard trade points much more evenly, with the point differential staying within two for all but two points. With the Crimson down, 21-18, the squad rallied off three straight points to tie it. After trading points to bring it to 24-all, an ace by junior Hannah Schmidt and an attack error by the Tigers gave Harvard the first frame.
Kendell Pekertin was the only Tiger player to record double digit kills with 11. After starting 4-0 in Ivy League play, Princeton has dropped its last three games in the Ancient Eight.
“This weekend we had some tough opponents,” Schmidt said. “We tend to play better when we play great teams.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
Down two sets to none entering the break against Penn (6-12, 3-4), the Crimson was in need of a comeback to avoid falling to .500 in Ivy League play. That is exactly what happened. The team rebounded from two slow opening sets to jump out to big leads in the last three, taking down Penn, 3-2.
The Crimson did not trail in the last three sets. It won the first three points in each of those frames and did not look back. In the middle set, the Quakers managed to tie the game at 10. But Harvard would win seven of the next 10 points, taking a commanding lead and ultimately clinching the frame, 25-20.
“We were slow, and then made some adjustments and got going,” Weiss said. “Its awesome to come back [from two sets down] and win.”
After a decisive 25-15 win in the fourth to force the tiebreaking set, the Crimson jumped out to a 13-7 advantage, only to see that lead fall to two after a four-point run by Penn. A kill from sophomore Corie Bain put Harvard within one point of victory, which was clinched on the next point with a Quaker error.
Bain once again recorded a triple-double, tallying 12 kills, 27 assists, and 11 digs. Classmate Grace Weghorst led the attack for Harvard with 16 kills.
Friday marked the second time this year that the team has come from two sets to none to win. The first came in nonconference play against Santa Clara.
“We were definitely mentally down after the first two sets,” Walters said. “But we asked ourselves what type of team we were [during the break]. Then we mentally turned it on. We told ourselves losing was not an option.”
Harvard is tied for second in the Ivy League, one game behind last year’s conference winner, Yale.
“We tell them one day at a time,” Weiss said. ”And they’ve truly bought into that, and we’re going to keep doing that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since September, the Harvard men’s soccer team (8-3-1, 2-0-1 Ivy) left the pitch without a win Saturday in its 1-1 tie at Brown (3-4-5, 1-1-1). The Crimson scored first on a 16th minute goal by junior Tim Schmoll, but a 49th minute equalizer by Bears forward Ben Maurey provided the final margin.
“I thought that the guys certainly competed and fought hard,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “We played very well in the first half, [but] we didn’t get the same rhythm we usually did in the second half. Brown did well.”
For the third straight game, the Harvard offense struggled to find its form following nonconference play. The team had just six shots on goal on the day, bringing its total to 16 in three Ivy League games after notching 95 in nine nonconference games. The team has just three goals in Ancient Eight action after registering three or more in each of the five games before its league opener against Yale.
“The Ivy League is very competitive and every game matters, so it’s very much like a playoff game for every team,” Lehrer said. “Every kick, every throw-in matters. There are less opportunities for everyone in every game, and that happens across the Ivy League.”
The Crimson generated those opportunities with aplomb early. It started with a shot by junior Michael Klain in the third minute that Bears goalie Mitch Kupstas swatted away. Twelve minutes later, co-captain Kyle Henderson found the biggest body on the field—the 6’6” Schmoll—in the middle of the pitch for the opening score of the game.
“It was a great goal for the whole team,” Henderson said. “I think eight to ten players probably touched the ball on all the movement leading up to the goal, which is great.”
For the rest of the half, the defense kept Brown scoreless. The Bears did not register a shot until the 42nd minute, when a header by Gabe Welp went wide of the goal. Riding into intermission with its scoreless streak at 389 minutes, the defense was following the same script that had led Harvard to two straight 1-0 nonconference victories.
The streak never reached 400, however, as the Bears took care of their first opportunity of the second half to tie the game. After drawing a corner kick, Jack Gorab crossed the ball to an open Maurey, who finished the chance to become the first Ivy League player to score on junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez in 316 minutes.
Maurey nearly won the game for his team two minutes later, missing a shot wide. The Bears rattled off three more shots in the next 12 minutes, keeping Mendez on his heels in goal. The junior stood tall all half, saving two shots in the final eight minutes of the half and breaking up another Gorab corner kick in the 90th minute.
“He’s been fantastic at organizing and getting the best out of the players around him,” Lehrer said. “He communicates really well to them, and he goes over things with them they are struggling with and works out with them…. They know and trust that his information is good and what he says is in the best interest of the team.”
In the overtime period, both teams struggled to generate offense. The teams recorded a combined one shot in the first overtime and missed three of five shots in the second period wide. It was Harvard’s third overtime game of the season and its first draw.
“One hundred and ten minutes of soccer is a lot of soccer,” Henderson said. “But [with the result], we’ve put ourselves in a great spot, and now it’s about just going out and continuing to get better because we’re going to have to get better every game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a second straight year, Crimson Madness failed to disappoint. Both the event’s theatrics and personalities were out in full force, with a dose of basketball thrown in among the assorted skill contests for good measure. Below are a couple first impressions after the first look at this year’s squad:
1. Zena 2.0 is a lot like Zena 1.0 — Sophomore Zena Edosomwan broke onto the scene last year at Crimson Madness, dominating then-sophomores Evan Cummins and Michael Hall. It looked like the highly touted recruit, trying to crack a crowded frontcourt, would be a force immediately.
Friday was more of the same. Edosomwan dominated with 11 points inside, coming out with full intensity—something most of the team couldn’t claim to have—and barking at himself throughout the scrimmage. A year after he wooed the crowd with a Vince Carter throwback jersey in the dunk contest, the sophomore brought Lavietes to its feet by jumping over the 6’9” Chris Egi and 6’6” Charlie Anastasi en route to the most spectacular dunk of the night.
However, the same problems plagued Edosomwan from last year. He struggled on defense and continued to shoot the ball on nearly every touch (18.2 shots per 40 minutes last year). His offensive game looked more defined, but his defense and passing will be the keys to the growth of his game.
2. Laurent Rivard’s three-point record is safe — After losing one of the most prolific long-range bombers in Ivy League history, Harvard will have significantly more trouble spreading the floor this year. Only junior co-captain Siyani Chambers returns as a dependable shooting threat from behind the arc last year. Sophomore Corbin Miller looked good, nailing 10 of 15 shots in the three-point contest and three treys in the scrimmage, but freshman Andre Chatfield flashed an inconsistent if pretty stroke. The Crimson should easily have the best frontcourt in the Ivy League, but Chatfield and Miller will need to step up for the team to realize its larger goals.
3. Defense will be the calling card — Although it struggled shooting the ball, the Crimson looks as though it will be very hard to score on. With the exception of Miller-Chambers backcourts, the team will have good length at the wing with junior Agunwa Okolie, Chatfield, and returning Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders. Up front, between Moundou-Missi, Cummins, Egi, Edosomwan, senior Kenyatta Smith, and senior Jonah Travis the Crimson has a diverse and gritty assortment of players to throw at opponents. None of the six will do a particularly good job spacing the floor, but playing two of them up front will wreak havoc defensively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking to gain some momentum before its most important meet of the year, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country team split squads as competitors headed out to the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational and Princeton Invitational this weekend.
The races marked the last chance for the Crimson athletes to compete and stake their claim for a spot in the top 12 prior to the 2014 Ivy League Heptagonal Championships.
PRINCETON INVITATIONAL
On Saturday, many of the Crimson runners competing for a spot on the Heps roster got an early feel of the championships course at the Princeton Invitational.
“The experience is valuable,” captain Will Geiken said. “For them to get the experience on the course two weeks ahead of time, they’ll know which points they had difficulties with and will prepare for it these two weeks.”
The women had a strong day, placing seventh in a field of 35 teams led by sophomores Stephanie Deccy and Rachel Hampton, who finished in 36th and 46th, respectively with times of 22:30 and 22:35.
Harvard’s scoring group was closed out by freshman Elianna Shwayder, junior Emma Payne, and freshman Fiona Davis with times of 22:40, 22:52, 23:07, respectively, giving Harvard five of the top 90 scoring runners. This was good enough to beat out Ancient Eight rival Cornell and finish just behind Princeton.
On the men’s side, sophomore Brandon Price finished with a time of 25:07 to lead the team to a 50th place finish. The top five was wrapped up with four runners who finished within 10 seconds of each other as sophomore Evan Grandfield, sophomore Jack Stevenson, senior Fred Ward, and freshman Tyler Spear crossed the lines with times of 25:32, 25:36, 25:39, and 25:42.
The solid performance from the Crimson athletes has head coach Jason Saretsky believing that the team can pull together to its full potential by the time of Heps.
“I felt all along that we should be a contending team,” Saretsky said. “Everything hasn’t been able to come together yet, but everything we gear towards is with the championship in mind, and we’re building confidence.”
WISCONSIN ADIDAS INVITATIONAL
Looking to continue a solid season thus far, the men came out with a respectable performance led by junior Tom Purnell, who continued his strong campaign with a 24:33 finish, good enough for 85th in a field of 247.
The junior was followed by Geiken who finished just 10 seconds off, while freshman Ben Huffman continued his impressive collegiate debut by crossing the line with a time of 24:55, good for third on the team. Seniors Nephat Maritim and Dan Milechman closed out the scoring contingent with times of 24:56 and 25:23, respectively.
While the placement might not have indicated the best of races, the team continues to improve and asserted itself well against its fellow Ancient Eight competitors, beating out powerhouse Columbia and finishing just three spots behind 24th-ranked and Ivy favorite Princeton.
“Seeing how close we are to the Ivy League teams is pretty exciting for us,” Geiken said. “If we’re able to have a good day [at Heps], we can make a run at the Heps title.”
On the women’s side, seniors Molly Renfer and Whitney Thornburg, along with co-captain Alaina Alvarez, paced the team with finishes of 21:30, 21:39, and 21:41, respectively, on the 6k course. They were followed by freshman Courtney Smith and sophomore Sarah Gillespie with times of 21:50 and 22:13, giving the team a combined 798 points to place 34th in a field of 38.
While neither side had standout performances, Saretsky believes the team is still built for competitive success come Heps.
“It wasn’t necessarily their best day,” Saretsky said. “I think they competed well but there’s still definitely more to come…. [This experience] will only help them fuel their fire and get them excited.”
The races were won by Syracuse on the men’s side and Michigan State on the women’s side. Maksim Korolev ’14, who is using his fifth year of eligibility to compete for Stanford after graduating from Harvard, captured the men’s individual title.

The Harvard field hockey team split its two weekend home games, defeating Cornell, 2-1, on Saturday before losing to New Hampshire, 1-0, in overtime on Sunday.
Following two first half goals, the Crimson managed to hold off a second half surge from the Big Red on Saturday afternoon at Jordan Field. The 2-1 win was the team’s second Ivy League victory of the season following losses to Penn and Brown.
The win was especially big as Harvard (8-5, 2-2 Ivy) moved to within one game of first place in the Ancient Eight after handing Cornell (8-4, 3-1) its first conference loss of the season. There is now a four-way tie at the top of the standings with Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Princeton all sitting at 3-1 with three conference contests left to play.
“Cornell came in 3-0, and we knew we had a chance based on the scouting and how we’ve been playing so far this season,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden.“We had some unfortunate losses against Penn and Brown, and [now] the Ivy League is completely wide open. We had a mission to beat Cornell and regain our status in the Ivy League.”
NEW HAMPSHIRE 1, HARVARD 0 (OT)
Harvard had a quick turnaround following its big Ivy League victory when the team played host to New Hampshire on Sunday afternoon at Jordan Field. The Wildcats (5-10, 2-1 America East) were also coming off an important conference victory after defeating Vermont, 5-1, on Friday.
“UNH will be a great opportunity to get back at the way we would like to play games,” van Herwaarden said prior to the game. “I think [it] will be more of a technical-played game, which is typically something we deal very well with.”
Neither team was able to score in the 70 minutes of regulation, despite seven shots on goal by New Hampshire. The Crimson struggled to establish offensive momentum and was unable to register a single shot on goal.
In the fifth minute of overtime, Wildcat sophomore midfielder Lindsey Nerbonne dribbled to the top of the circle and fired the ball towards the inside right corner of the net. The unassisted shot finally made its way past junior goalkeeper Issy Davies, giving the visitors a 1-0 victory.
HARVARD 2, CORNELL 1
Following its two recent Ivy League losses, Harvard faced what was essentially a must-win contest against Cornell on Saturday afternoon.
The first half saw both teams struggle to maintain possession, but the Crimson was able to get on the scoreboard after senior forward Catriona McDonald put a pass from freshman midfielder Hannah Wellington into the back of the net for her second goal of the season.
Following the tally, the Big Red managed to create a few scoring chances against Davies. In the 24th minute, however, a shot from outside the arc by Harvard senior Noel Painter gave the Crimson a 2-0 lead going into halftime. The Los Gatos, Calif. native leads the team with seven goals this season.
“The ball got rejected by Cornell,” Painter said. “I happened to be at the right place at the right time, stopped it, and then I just hit it into the corner.”
Harvard completed many long passes to begin the second half, but a penalty corner in the 50th minute got Cornell on the scoreboard. Big Red senior midfielder Ann DiPastina took the corner, which was centered by junior midfielder Taylor Standiford and then scalded past Davies by junior back Marisa Siergiej.
“In the second half, it was a little harder,” Painter said. “We were on our heels a little bit, but I think at the end of the day, we got the win, which is all that matters.”
The Big Red was able to keep the pressure on the Crimson for the rest of the second half, with the team registering six more shots and attempting four more corners before the final horn sounded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Emily Mosbacher scored early, sophomore forward Midge Purce scored late, and the Harvard women’s soccer team continued its run of Ivy League dominance with a 2-0 win over Brown in Providence, R.I., on Saturday.
With the victory, the Crimson (8-3-2, 3-0-1 Ivy) extended its 12-game unbeaten streak in Ancient Eight play that stretches back to 2012. The team currently leads the Ivy League by three points.
“We were only halfway through until last night,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “Now, we’re finally on the other side…. It’s time to regroup, take stock of where we are, and finish off the final stretch.”
Harvard dominated all statistical aspects of the matchup against the Bears (5-6-3, 0-2-2). Over the course of the game, the Crimson badly outshot the hosts, 24 to eight. Corner kicks were similarly unbalanced, as Harvard tallied 11 to Brown’s three. But gritty play from the Bears kept the score close and the match undecided until the final minutes.
“[Brown had] good defending and good goalkeeping,” Leone said. “It was physical…. I was proud of how our team responded to that.”
It didn’t take long for Harvard to get on the board. In the 11th minute, junior midfielder Haley Washburn played in a corner that found Mosbacher’s head for a near-post finish. The goal was the Woodside, Calif. native’s fourth on the season.
“It was a great finish and perfect ball sent in,” Leone said. “That definitely helped open up the game a little bit more.”
After Mosbacher’s goal, the Crimson put steady pressure on the Bears’ defense. Between the 17th and 37th minute, Harvard recorded nine shots, while Brown could not muster one.
Purce, who leads Harvard in goals with five, iced the win with an 87th minute score. After receiving a short pass from senior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, Purce dribbled through the Brown defense and sprinted for goal. Her breakaway finish destroyed any Brown hopes of forcing overtime with a score.
In what is becoming a refrain for the season, Harvard’s defense clamped down on the Bears’ attack for most of the game. Senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba parried four Brown shots on the way to her fourth shutout of the year. As a team, the Crimson defense has prevented its opponent from scoring in nine of 13 games this season.
“We don’t let our guard down no matter the time or the score of the game,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “Defending well starts from the front line, and as a team we are committed to defending all over the field, which makes [the job of] the back line easier.”
The game took a physical turn in the first minutes of the second half, with both teams racking up several fouls. Around the 60th minute, the Bears put sustained pressure on the Harvard defense with two corner kicks and several shots. But a combination of saves by Emba and defensive clearances prevented Brown from getting an equalizer.
“It was a collective thing,” Leone said. “The front line all the way to the back defending was some of the best we’ve ever done…. We only had [six fouls]. That states how well our feet were moving and how in control we were.”
After Purce scored, Brown did not create any dangerous opportunities. In fact, it was Purce who had a chance to add another goal in the 88th minute, when she notched her third shot on target.
With three games remaining, Harvard holds the lead in the conference standings by three points. But the final stretch of league play will test the Crimson as it faces off against Columbia, Princeton, and Dartmouth, respectively the second, third, and fourth-place teams in the Ivy League.
“Going into the final three games, our mindset is the same as it has been,” Margolius said. “We are going to keep our energy and determination high and never get complacent because anything can happen in the Ivy League at any point in the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To say the Harvard men’s water polo team’s loss to Brown on Sunday morning was close would be an understatement.
Harvard coach Ted Minnis perhaps summed it up best.
“It’s a game of inches,” he said.
Inches were the difference for the No. 19 Crimson (15-6, 4-3 CWPA) as it fell to the Bears (14-5, 7-1), 15-14, in triple-overtime. Victory was within reach in the second overtime when co-captain Max Murphy hurled a shot towards the Brown goal, just nicking the post to keep the score tied at 14 each.
With neither team able to score, the game went into a third sudden death overtime frame, where Brown was finally able to put the game away with a goal by sophomore Yahel Murvitz-Lahav.
The sudden death thriller came on the second day of competition for the fifth Ivy League Championship tournament.  All eight Ivy League schools came together to compete, with Brown hosting the two-day tournament. Though Harvard, Brown, and Princeton are the only varsity water polo teams in the Ivy League, their respective club teams represented the other five members of the Ancient Eight.
On the first day of the tournament, the five club teams played a round-robin style bracket, with the winner going on to face the loser in the varsity round.
On the second day of competition, the three varsity teams competed, with Harvard facing Brown, and Princeton facing Dartmouth, the winner of the club bracket. As Brown defeated Harvard, the Bears moved on to face Princeton in the championship match, which the Tigers took to claim their second consecutive Ivy League title. The Crimson faced the Big Green in the consolation match, and claimed third place overall with its victory over the Dartmouth club team.
HARVARD 15, DARTMOUTH 11
Despite being just an exhibition match and not counting toward its official league record, Harvard’s game against Dartmouth was a fight for honor within the Ivy League. By winning, the Crimson claimed third overall in the tournament.
Coming off of such a long game against Brown potentially impacted the Crimson in its game against the Big Green later in the day. Although the team was able to create a big lead in the first half, it began to slip away in the second half. The Crimson was up 10-3 at the end of the first half, but let Dartmouth get within four goals by the end of the contest.
“I wasn’t ever really worried about losing, but still, we are trying to become a championship-caliber team,” junior goalie Colin Woolway said. “Championship-caliber teams play their best at all times, and I don’t think we necessarily did that [against Dartmouth].”
BROWN 15, HARVARD 14
Although the Crimson was unsuccessful avenging two earlier losses to Brown this season, Sunday marked its closest match against the Bears to date, as the game featured three overtime periods.
In their previous two contests, Harvard and Brown were close through halftime, until the Bears ran away with the games in the second halves. The Crimson eventually fell by scores of 13-8 and 19-11 in each of the respective games. This week, however, the team was able to maintain strong play throughout all of regulation time, and Brown needed the additional three overtime frames to finally overtake Harvard.
“We definitely battled for the first four quarters with Brown, and that was something that we hadn’t done yet this year,” Minnis said. “We had a bad quarter in each of the two first games…so we did some good things to adjust and play well.”
The Crimson was able to outscore the Bears 3-2 in the final period and keep the game close until the very end. It was this final frame that had been the team’s Achilles heel in previous weeks as Brown ran away with victory.
Junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel, sophomore attacker Joey Colton, and junior attacker Blake Lee each contributed goals in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime.
The men return home to Blodgett Pool next weekend, where they have the chance to face off again against MIT and Connecticut College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the 2014 Head of the Charles Regatta, the Radcliffe crew team rowed to a runner-up finish and three additional top-10 finishes on a chilly Sunday afternoon.
Despite finishing second overall, the Black and White lightweights secured the top collegiate finish in the eights division, placing second only to the Dutch national team. The top Radcliffe heavyweight eights boat stroked to an eighth-place finish.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
A boat stroked by co-captain Lizzy Fitzhenry and coxed by senior Jenny Wong ended up placing eighth in the women’s heavyweight championship eights division. Radcliffe’s second varsity boat finished 23rd in the 34-boat field paced by Cambridge University.
“We got off to a really strong start,” Fitzhenry said. “We moved very quickly on Notre Dame, who was directly in front of us, and we fought alongside them until Weeks [Bridge]. We just in time got in front of them in order to take the tight turn that we needed.”
Even with this smooth start, the race was not smooth sailing. The conditions provided quite a challenge.
“There was definitely a very strong headwind for a majority of the course, which always makes it more difficult,” Fitzhenry said. “But we are an experienced crew and we dealt with the conditions well. And although we had a few rough patches, we were able to get it back pretty quickly.”
Radcliffe also prepared to combat the specific challenges of the course. The three-mile race under bridges was full of twists and turns. The Head of the Charles is also a head race, meaning boats start at different times instead of racing side-by-side.
“During the fall, we definitely practice the Head of the Charles course a lot, and we’ll start our boats in head-style racing,” Fitzhenry said. “We were prepared for it.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
Captain Olivia Henry, along with four other seniors, earned Radcliffe’s highest finish of the day for its lightweights, as junior coxswain Gabriella Giugliano guided the crew to a second-place finish out of 12 boats in the women’s eights division.
The boat was the top collegiate crew in the race, finishing 18 seconds ahead of Boston University. The Dutch national team crossed the line 15 seconds ahead of the Black and White to take top honors.
“[The Dutch] were very fast,” said freshman Ada Bielawski, who rowed in the Radcliffe boat. “We went right after them, and we really wanted to tail them down.”
Radcliffe’s second varsity boat placed 10th, and an additional Black and White boat took seventh in a 13-boat lightweight fours division.
The course tested the crew’s endurance. While most collegiate courses are 2,000 meters, the Head of the Charles spans double this distance.
“One of our biggest challenges is rowing as well through every section of the course—not just the beginning,” Bielawski said. “Even trying to make up time at the end is very important for us.”
The head-style racing and narrow course required active strategy from every member of the team. The top Radcliffe boat gained confidence as it closed the gap on its competitors.
“The crews that us rowers can see, we could tell that they fell away,” Bielawski said. “Their coxswains didn’t take really good courses, so we could tell we were gaining on them, and that definitely helped us get through the rest of the piece.”
While the heavyweight and lightweight boats both combated weather conditions, a narrow course, and a head-style race, Radcliffe crew has bigger goals for its year-long season.
“We’re all really excited that we did so well in this regatta,” Beilawski said. “We can see that our team has a lot of depth because all of our boats did really well. We really want to carry that through in the spring and win a national championship again. That’s our goal.”
“It’s great to do well at Head of the Charles,” Fitzhenry added. “This is just a stepping stone and an opportunity to learn about ourselves and how we can get faster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a competitive field at the Stanford Intercollegiate tournament in Stanford, Calif., Harvard women’s golf used a strong last day to finish 15th out of a field of 17 teams. Led by sophomore Anne Cheng’s solid weekend showing, the Crimson shot 909 over the three-day event, good for 43-over-par overall.
“Some of us weren’t as sharp as we wanted to be,” junior Christine Lin said. “But we believed in ourselves and knew that if we kept doing what we needed to, it would help us get where we needed to be.”
Cheng topped the board for the team with an overall score of four-over-par, which put her in 40th place individually. On the first day, she paced Harvard with an even-par 71, which was the lowest single-round mark of the weekend.
“I stuck a lot of my shots within five feet of the pin,” Cheng said. “That helped me a lot with making pars and making birdies.”
Yet a top finish at this tournament required more than Cheng could do this time. The Stanford Intercollegiate annually hosts one of the most competitive fields of the sport. This year was no exception as the tournament, drew eight teams from last year’s top 25.
Two of these top teams tied for first. Stanford matched USC, last year’s champion, with a three-day total of 15-under-par. UCLA’s Bronte Law won the event individually with an overall score of eight-under-par that included a first round low of 65, the best opening 18 tally of any of the women.
“This was probably the strongest field in the tournament other than the NCAA championship finals,” Cheng said.
In addition to Cheng’s performance, senior Brenna Nelsen shot 10-over-par for the weekend, including a low of 73 on the first day. Lin recorded the Crimson’s third-lowest score at 226 over the three days. Junior Courtney Hooton and captain Tiffany Lim rounded out the squad with overall scores of 17-over-par and 29-over-par, respectively.
“We played better as the weekend went by,” Lin said. “We did a good job keeping our heads high—just persevering and moving forward no matter what. I think we hung in there as a team.”
But as the only Ivy League member participating, the Harvard women took some time to acclimate—after the first round, the Crimson was tied for last.
“The first day, a few of us were kind of out of our comfort zone, seeing these great players and being in a field that we usually don’t compete with,” Lin said. “We expected the discomfort, and we knew that we were going to be in a tough field. We couldn’t let that bother us or our games.”
More play led to marked improvement on the course. In the third round, all Harvard players shot as well or better than they had in the previous round. Hooten dropped three strokes, and Lin and Nelsen both dropped two strokes of their own, to propel Harvard past Oregon State.
“I focused on thinking about my own game and hitting each shot one at a time,” Lin said. “That’s the way we play.”
The Crimson could hardly have asked for better weather conditions. Throughout the weekend, temperatures hovered in the sixties and seventies, and the wind speed remained low.
Harvard’s performance followed impressive showings at the Yale and Penn State invites, where the Crimson earned second out of 16 and third of 14 teams, respectively. However, the team will not have a chance to apply the lessons from the weekend until the spring, as the Stanford Intercollegiate is the last scheduled event of the fall.
“We’ll be hitting indoors and going to driving ranges,” Cheng said. “We’ll try to keep our game sharp.”

The quick and dirty about what's going on around the Ancient Eight
Harvard is well-known for grade inflation (#aminusgate), which we can all safely agree is better than grade deflation, a policy Princeton famously has—or rather, had. Earlier this month, faculty members finally voted to repeal this policy, making our peers over in New Jersey breathe a big sigh of relief and stop doing the reading for their sections. The administration figured this policy leads to “additional stress for students” and that it even “affects applications from prospective students.” Gee, maybe they were wondering why they were losing so many cross-admits to Harvard?
This semester, Harvard’s introductory computer science course CS50 broke enrollment records, making it the largest class offered at Harvard in the last five years. Following this, Yale appears to have finally conceded defeat. Yale is currently considering offering CS50 on its own campus—not its own version of CS50, but the exact CS50 that’s taught at Harvard. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, we guess.
Contrary to our upstanding moral compasses (save for the occasional Annenburglar), Dartmouth students have no qualms about stealing food from their dining halls. Theft from dining halls is so bad, as a matter of fact, that the college recently took some desperate measures and roped off the rear entrance of a dining hall and shut its glass doors. Dartmouth Dining Services, meanwhile, is bamboozled by the reason behind these thefts. “I can’t seem to explain it, but there seems to be a correlation between bad behavior and alcohol and drug use,” their Dining Services director said in The Dartmouth's article. Helpful hint, Dartmouth: ever heard of drunchies? While Harvard students can turn to Tasty on a Friday night, Dartmouth students, being in the middle of nowhere, can only resort to pillaging their own dining halls.
Columbia students, on the other hand, live in the artistic and cultural haven that is New York City. It’s only understandable, then, that students try to channel the masterpieces from the Met in their graffiti around the campus walls. A Columbia recently student took it upon herself to roam around the buildings and search for the most interesting works of graffiti. These works include extensive sketches of male genitalia as well as something called the “pineapple man,” a dancing fruit that appears on walls and pipes all around campus. However, the pinnacle of the student street artistry in Columbia pales in comparison to Harvard’s student artwork, in particular the extensive and beautiful graffiti that lines the walls of the tunnels beneath Adams House. Columbia, you ain’t got nothing on us.

For those of you with family and friends who are just dying to get the Harvard experience but don't have the time to visit campus, worry no more! Here are all the highlights of the Harvard life pulled straight from the most reliable source on the web—Yelp! We’ve taken the time to craft this handy list of sights, sounds, and tastes (don’t lick the foot) we think best encapsulate Harvard. You’re welcome!
1. “The campus actually is smaller than I imagined,” writes Jill from California. Clearly Jill didn’t make any freshman year party crawls from the Yard to the River to the Quad to the River and finally to Tasty Burger.
2. “Rub the shoe at the John Harvard statue,” suggests Keith from Texas. Keith, I know exactly how you feel. *zips up fly* Meanwhile, Evelyn from California rumors “I was told the students pee on the toe others kiss and touch for luck. Classy!” Blasphemy! Now why is my zipper jammed?
3. “I actually helped Mark [Zuckerberg] invent Facebook. One day while stuffing our faces with fantastic lobster gnocchi made by the Harvard dining hall chefs…” Who told HUDS to do away with lobster gnocchi? Can we get this back on the menu? I’m okay with cutting one of the eight varieties of swai.
4. “Rude, obnoxious, snobby, and evil,” says Megan from Massachusetts. Sounds like somebody loved her Ec 10 section!
5. “I don’t like how they check your bags when you leave the library even though you have to swipe your student ID to get in.” But what else would I be carrying in this Gutenberg Bible-sized backpack?
6. “Not too far from Harvard Square,” says Chris from Massachusetts. Thank you Captain Obvious. We salute your Yalie level of intellect.
7. “This place would have been a lot cooler if I didn’t get rejected…” confesses Camellia from California. Hug it out, girl. Hug it out.
