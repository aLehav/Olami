After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was on odd reversal of history on Friday night for the Harvard women’s volleyball team. Just over two weeks after defeating Columbia, 3-0, the Crimson (11-10, 4-7 Ivy) fell to the Lions (14-7, 8-3 Ivy) tonight in straight sets, 25-19, 25-22, and 25-20.
In its win over the Lions in October, the Crimson came out from the first whistle with an aggressive offense and sound defense, neither of which could be found in tonight’s loss.
In the first set, Harvard fell behind, 20-9, and was unable to gain enough momentum to overcome the deficit, dropping the first set, 25-19.
The second game was the most competitive of the match, with the visiting Crimson and the Lions trading the lead. Harvard eventually went down, 23-22, and Columbia executed two timely kills and capitalized on an attack error to take the set.
In the third frame, the Crimson fought back from a six-point deficit to pull within three, but was unable to get any closer.  A service error and a Columbia kill sealed Harvard’s fate, as the Lions came up with the 25-20 win.
With the loss, Harvard drops to 4-7 in the Ancient Eight. The Crimson has a chance to improve its record with another conference match tomorrow night against Cornell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score set at 4-2 in Princeton’s favor with a little over eight minutes remaining in the final period, Harvard junior Luke Greiner reenergized the home side when his solo effort found the back of the net. But with 2:12 left, a Tiger power play saw out the clock, leaving the Crimson with a loss in its first conference matchup of the season on Friday night.
"It really does speak a lot to the character of our team that we battled back," captain Ryan Grimshaw said. "We really thought we had it at the end. We weren't going to give up. It was a good effort by us getting back."
Only having played one game thus far—an exhibition contest with Western Ontario early last week—Harvard (0-1, 0-1 ECAC) came out looking for a positive start to its season against a team that already had three games under its belt.
Princeton’s early-season experience showed as the Tigers (3-1, 1-1) jumped out to a 2-0 lead. Princeton’s Brodie Zuk opened the scoring, sneaking one past freshman goalkeeper Steve Michalek with less than a minute left in the first period. Princeton’s Michael Sdao added to the Tigers’ lead five minutes into the second period.
Nine minutes into the second frame, senior Alex Killorn took advantage of a look at net when he received a cross pass from junior Alex Fallstrom. The forward whipped the puck past the left shoulder of the Tiger goalkeeper, cutting the Crimson’s deficit in half.
With the momentum on Harvard’s side, the third period began with both teams playing physically. But it was Princeton’s Aaron Kesselman who came up with a score to put the game nearly out of reach. With 7:29 played, Killorn notched his second goal of the day when a powerful shot from the blue line deflected off a defender’s leg into the net.
Four minutes later, the Tigers’ Eric Carlson put the visitors back up by two. Greiner pulled his team within one with a shot from the left flank, but it was too late, as Princeton managed to run out the clock.
The Crimson faces Quinnipiac Saturday night at 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say records are meant to be broken, but someone might want to tell the Harvard football team that doesn’t necessarily mean every week.
While the 2011 Crimson offense has established itself as one of the best in Harvard history over the past few games, and though the Crimson defense has put together numerous dominant performances recently, it was their coach’s turn to take his place in the Harvard record books on Saturday.
With Harvard’s 35-21 victory over Columbia, Tim Murphy won his 118th game at the helm of the Crimson, breaking the all-time mark set by his predecessor, Joe Restic.
“To me, it’s not a personal achievement,” said a humbled Murphy, who also won his 150th career game today. “It really is a reflection of the hundreds of Harvard football players and the dozens of assistant coaches who won those games. If it wasn’t for the tremendous support of our alumni and our administration on both sides of the river, it wouldn’t have happened.”
To help him break the record, Murphy relied on his offense once again, and the unit continued to shine.
Though the Crimson failed to put together its fifth straight 40-plus point week—it would’ve been the first time since 1888 that feat had been achieved—Harvard’s 35 points were more than enough to top the lowly Lions (0-8, 0-5 Ivy), who remained winless while the Crimson (7-1, 5-0) won its seventh straight.
After an error-filled first half in which Harvard succumbed to numerous false starts, lost a fumble, and had an interception returned for a touchdown, the Crimson offense found its groove in the third quarter.
It was the defense that got things started early in the period, when senior cornerback Brian Owusu intercepted Columbia quarterback Sean Brackett at the Lions 35 and returned it to the 24. Freshman halfback Zach Boden went to work from there, running powerfully towards the goal line on back-to-back carries of 12 and 11 yards. Senior quarterback Collier Winters finished the drive with a one-yard QB sneak for the score, putting the Crimson up, 21-14.
After Columbia went three-and-out on its next drive, Harvard took over at its 48 and immediately ran a double-reverse to senior wideout Adam Chrissis, who picked up 11. On the next play, Winters went deep to classmate Chris Lorditch, and the receiver made a leaping catch over a Columbia defensive back on a slightly-underthrown ball, then cut back and darted by two would-be tacklers for an impressive 41-yard touchdown.
Harvard would score again on its next drive early in the fourth quarter, with Winters hitting junior Kyle Juszczyk on a short pass. The tight end did the rest, breaking a tackle, slipping by another defender, and darting down the right sideline and into the end zone for another 41-yard score to put Harvard up, 35-14.
“It was a five-yard speed out,” Juszczyk said. “I’m always thankful to get in the open field, because a lot of time the guys are smaller than me, and I’m able to take advantage of that.”
The Lions tried to get back in the game on their next possession, with Brackett, a dual-threat quarterback, rushing for 20 yards on second-and-12 and later a 19-yard touchdown scamper to cut the Crimson lead to two scores.
But Harvard would not let it get any closer than that, stopping Columbia on fourth down from the Crimson 22 on the Lions’ subsequent possession to all but end the game.
“[Columbia] made everything hard today,” Murphy said. “They’re a good football team, they made us very uncomfortable, they made us squirm ... [But] I’m proud of how we responded in the second half. We played with poise, we played really hard, and we executed pretty well.”
As has occurred numerous times this season, the game began with an opposing offense moving the ball with ease against the Harvard defense. On Saturday, the Lions went 67 yards in 12 plays in the contest’s opening drive, capping the series with a powerful 12-yard Griffin Lowry touchdown run to put Columbia up early.
Winters brought his team right back down the field, beginning the Crimson’s opening possession with three consecutive completions to sophomore Cameron Brate, classmate Matt Brown, and Lorditch to bring the ball into Columbia territory. But three straight Crimson false starts and two incompletions would set the Crimson back to a third-and-25 from the Harvard 39.
From there, Winters went back to his favorite target, connecting with Lorditch on a perfect pass off a flag route, and the senior kept his feet in bounds for a 29-yard completion and a first down. Then, Winters hit Juszczyk for 19 yards and Chrissis for five before going back to his junior tight end for a 15-yard touchdown to cap a drive on which he was 8-of-10 and Harvard did not attempt a run.
“Winters is phenomenal,” Columbia coach Norries Wilson said. “[Juszczyk] played great today, gave us fits all game.”
But early in the second quarter, Winters made a big mistake. After the quarterback brought the Crimson down to the Columbia 16 with passes of 19 yards to sophomore Andrew Berg and 43 yards to Lorditch, the senior tried to throw an out that Columbia cornerback Ross Morand read perfectly, jumped, and returned for an 87-yard score.
“We did a very poor job of taking care of the football,” Murphy said. “That was probably the sloppiest half of football we’ve had all year.”
But the resilient quarterback would lead his team back down the field on its next drive, completing two passes to Jusczcyk and a 21-yarder to Brown to set up a five-yard touchdown run by junior Treavor Scales that tied the game at 14 before the break.
Winters would finish 20-of-30 for 323 yards and three touchdowns, with Jusczcyk (seven catches for 118 yards) and Lorditch (four for 123) each eclipsing the century mark in receiving.
Those performances helped Murphy get his record-setting win, a feat he accomplished in his 18th season—five years faster than Restic.
“When you get into coaching, you don’t think about records,” Murphy said. “I’m more into the process, more into the journey, and the journey’s been great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a record-breaking performance from co-captain Christine Wu, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (11-11, 4-8 Ivy) was unable to break its weekend losing streak, dropping a 3-2 decision to Cornell (6-18, 3-9 Ivy) on Saturday. The Crimson was coming off a 3-0 loss to Columbia on Friday­­­—a game in which Wu moved to second-place in Ivy League history for career digs, amassing 1,780 in her four years in a Harvard uniform. The Big Red took the Crimson down in five sets on its Senior Night, winning 21-25, 25-17, 25-22, 23-25, and 15-13.
Harvard took control of the game in the first set, tallying a 25-21 win to open the match. Cornell and the Crimson traded the lead in the game until a combination from co-captain Sandra Lynne Fryhofer and freshman Katherine Ingersoll combined to give Harvard a 19-16 edge. The Big Red tried to fight back, but Harvard did not relinquish the lead on its way to an opening-set victory.
The next two games, however, were all Cornell, with the Big Red taking the second frame handily, largely in part to an early 7-3 lead. The third frame was more competitive—with six lead changes and 13 ties—but ultimately the Crimson could not overcome Cornell’s offensive momentum, falling 25-22. The fourth set—a must-win for Harvard—was much of the same, with six lead changes and 14 ties, but the Crimson came out on the winning side, forcing a decisive fifth set.
Despite the Big Red jumping out to a 7-2 lead, Harvard forced its way back into contention, taking a 10-9 advantage. However, Cornell went on a 4-0 run to reclaim the lead at 13-10. Harvard fought back within one, but two kills from Big Red seniors sealed the match.
With the loss, the Crimson drops to 4-8 in the Ancient Eight as it finishes up its season with a pair of home matches next weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 17 regular season games, 13 league goals, and 663 minutes of conference play, the Harvard women’s soccer team captured its third Ivy League championship in four years.
With a 1-0 win at Columbia (6-10-1, 3-3-1 Ivy) Saturday evening, the Crimson (12-4-1, 6-0-1) took sole ownership of the Ancient Eight trophy. A strong Penn squad had defeated Princeton beforehand and was hoping for Harvard to slip up—which would have allowed the Quakers to claim a share of the top spot—but Crimson rookie Lauren Urke’s goal in the 21st minute was enough to guarantee her squad the victory and the outright Ivy title.
“It’s an amazing feeling [to win the championship],” Urke said. “I’m so proud of every single person on our team and of the teamwork that we put together to win this title because we couldn’t have done it without every single person’s effort.”
Apart from looking for the upset, the Lions had another reason to come out strong—senior forward Ashlin Yahr was one goal away from tying the program’s all-time career goals record of 30. But opposing freshman goalkeeper Bethany Kanten, who has starred all season in between the Crimson posts, posted a clean sheet and denied Yahr from reaching the milestone on Columbia’s Senior Day.
“One of their forwards was trying to break a school record, so it was a very big game for both of us,” co-captain defender Lindsey Kowal said. “The game meant so much for both teams, and I’m glad we came out on top.”
Kanten finished the day with two saves, while her counterpart, Lillian Klein, had a slightly busier day in net, saving four of the Crimson’s six shots on goal. The Lions’ squad was credited for a save in the 32nd minute, when a shot by Urke threatened to sneak past her.
Back-and-forth play characterized the evening contest, with both teams finishing with 10 shots each.
Columbia looked dangerous at first, applying pressure on the Harvard back line with two early corner kicks and three shots, one of which came from Yahr that flew wide at 19:38.
“Columbia came out really strong, they were fighting really hard, and they played a good game,” Urke said. “We knew that our whole team would have to come out fighting and give an extra effort to win the game, and I think that’s exactly what we did.”
Urke quelled the Lions’ offensive efforts with her goal a minute later. Rookie Meg Casscells-Hamby, who finished the regular season second on the team with 14 points, dribbled into the box from the right and saw Urke making a late run toward the goal on the other side. Casscells-Hamby slipped a pass through several defenders onto the right foot of the Harvard defender, who put away a shot from 15 yards out to score the winning tally.
“We knew that after one goal, we couldn’t stop; we couldn’t be down; we couldn’t try to defend the rest of the game,” Urke said. “We needed more in order to be confident that we could win the game.”
Urke followed up the score with two more shots on goal in the ensuing 12 minutes. Yahr forced Kanten to come up with a save at 36:14, and the Columbia senior had a follow-up effort that flew high two seconds later.
Lions teammate Liz Wicks hit the post near the end of the half, nearly grabbing the equalizer to reenergize the home side.
The second half began like the first, with Columbia applying pressure from the start. But Harvard settled down and did not allow the Lions to get a shot off after the 59th minute until five minutes before the clock ran out, when the Lion star Yahr’s header flew high.
Casscells-Hamby forced Klein to make a save at 69:20, marking the last time the Crimson threatened.
When the referee blew the final whistle, the Harvard women came together and celebrated with the numerous alumni who attended the night game.
“It was a great celebration,” Kowal said. “We’re just so glad that we came out on top. Our goal was to be champions—we wanted nothing less. We wanted to be greedy, and we wanted the whole thing.”

Legend has it that a gnome lives in the tunnel between the Harvard Square and Central Square T stops. The statue is said to reside near an old abandoned T stop—a ghost station—that can still be seen from the Red Line trains. We found the gnome, and so can you.
Here's a step-by-step guide to finding the mythical gnome: Get on a train going outbound from Central Square. Find a good window seat on the right side of the train. Press your face against the glass so your reflection doesn't block your view (ignore any worries about disease or previous riders' face sweat). As the train slows down to enter Harvard Station, you'll see the spooky remains of the T stop that once served Harvard Square. Prepare yourself for the gnome! At the end of the ghost station, you'll find the gnome statue around eye level. As it flashes by you, you'll notice that it is about 2.5-3 feet tall and looks grayed with dirt and grime. It's difficult to tell what it's made of in the dim light, but an MBTA official gave us some insight into the mysterious statue.
Angela M. Mitchell, an employee of the MBTA for 24 years, says that this urban legend is less mysterious than most would think. "One of our coworkers stuck it out there." Initially placed in the old station as a joke, the gnome has remained virtually unknown to T riders, though it sits just 50 feet from the main platform and has been there for some time. "He's been there for 13 or 14 years," Mitchell said, an inside joke to the MBTA officials and the lucky riders who see the gnome play "peek-a-boo" with those lucky enough to catch the right angle.
Though the mystery has been debunked, a plastic garden gnome remains an eerie thing to pop out from the darkness of the abandoned underground. So next time you ride the T, make sure you look out for the gnome, a practical joke that created a Harvard legend.

When Camille S. Owens '13 spotted a large white bird through the window of the Pfoho dining hall, she thought she might as well go outside to take a gander.
After getting a closer look at the goose, Owens and friends determined that the animal appeared misplaced, and called HUPD and the Cambridge Police Department. Both police departments said they did not need to respond to the animal if it wasn't hurt, and the ASPCA didn't pick up the phone on a Saturday night.
The goose, adorned with snow-white feathers, was in appearance unlike the Canadian geese found around Fresh Pond. Since it exhibited a tame demeanor around people, Owens and the other birdwatchers suspected that the goose might be somebody's pet.
A crowd of spectators gradually gathered outside of Pfoho. "They mate for life," Cabot resident Samuel F. Himel '13 commented, googling up the visiting species on his phone.
Pfoho security guard Peter Flynn told the concerned crowd said that there is "no policy" for dealing with animals near a House—he's seen skunks, possums, raccoons, and feral cats in his time, and he's left them all undisturbed. However, due to Flynn's suspicion that this placid goose was domesticated, he called his supervisor. "I wouldn't want the bird to die."
But when the two Securitas road supervisors Flynn had summoned arrived by van, they weren't nearly as sympathetic. "The bird's not hurting anybody," said one of the supervisors, who declined to give his name. "The law of the jungle's gotta take effect."
Flynn pointed out that the goose was unafraid of people or cars, to which the supervisor responded, "So are pigeons."
Flynn insisted, "Geese are a higher order," and dining hall employee Melanie Bizarrea protested, "That's not fair. He's completely lost...don't laugh about it."
But in the end, the goose was left to its own devices outside of Pfoho. As the humans headed in from the cold, the supervisor jested, "Who's the owner of Hong Kong? What's the name? Come over here: free poultry."

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
The University of Pennsylvania is in danger of losing its accreditation as an institution of higher education if it does not extend the length of its academic year. According to The Daily Pennsylvanian, Penn administrators are working on a proposal that would move the start of the University's 2013-2014 school year to Aug. 28—the first time since 1974 that the school would start classes in August. State regulations require semester-long college courses to meet for at least 42 hours of instructional time, but The DP writes that under Penn's current schedule, some classes meet for as little as 36 hours.
Vinny Guadagnino of "Jersey  Shore" fame gave a guest lecture this past week during a Columbia University sociology class entitled "Mistake, Misconduct, Disaster." Guadagnino, who (between gym, tan, and laundry) works with the teen social action organization Do Something, discussed his personal experience with bullying with the students. TMZ writes that the lecture went "really well" until the question-and-answer portion, when a student asked, "What gives you, as a cast member of 'Jersey Shore,' the right to interrupt this class and then lecture us on setting a good example?" According to the celebrity news website, the question left guido star "stumped."
Despite Princeton University's plan to prohibit freshman from affiliating with fraternities and sororities starting next fall, this year's rush number were similar to those of previous years, according to The Daily Princetonian. The decision to prohibit students from joining Greek organizations during their first year was "driven primarily by a conviction that social and residential life at Princeton should continue to revolve around the residential colleges, the eating clubs, and the shared experience of essentially all undergraduates living and dining on campus," Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman wrote in a letter to students.
