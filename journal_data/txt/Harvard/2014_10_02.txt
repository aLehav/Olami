After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black Community and Student Theater Group’s production of “Negative” will make you laugh. And then it will make you think about why you laughed. And as the play goes on, you’ll keep laughing, but odds are you probably won’t feel good about it.
The play, adapted and directed by S. Jumai Yusuf ’16, is based on a 2004 play of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates. In an alternate universe in which white people have been historically oppressed and fettered by black people, a wealthy black woman, Veronica (Caroline B. Hubbard ’17), antagonizes her college roommate, a poor white girl from the rural Midwest named Mary (Julie S. Monrad ’15). It’s not something that sounds particularly humorous.
“When I first looked at the play, I was like ‘Why is this a comedy? It’s so serious,’” Yusuf says. “But there are really funny moments in it. And the second act is still funny, but I feel like people will be just a little more uncomfortable.”
That second act is Yusuf’s brainchild. Essentially a repetition of the first act, the latter half of the production has one crucial difference: the roles are switched. Mary is now the rich and privileged one, and Veronica is poor and oppressed. The changes are minor and the comedy untouched—but here the humor has an edge to it.
“You’re supposed to notice the difference, and it’s supposed to be kind of funny and uncomfortable in the beginning but definitely more uncomfortable in the second act,” Monrad says. “ There are moments where you’re like, That’s real.’”
There are subtle variations between the two acts—different insults, different preconceptions, different biases. “There are little nuggets that are different, which—I hope, at least—keep you watching, keep you interested,” Yusuf says.
“Negative” is not a lighthearted, feel-good comedy. And it’s certainly not a straightforward, hyper-serious production. It’s an intricate, layered piece—a complex work to deliver a complex message. The task it has set itself is not easy, but perhaps that’s what makes that task worth attempting.                                         
“It’s an important topic to discuss,” Hubbard says. “And I think theater is a great way to do that because it lets people sit back and watch something visually and draw their own conclusions instead of have someone talk at them”
The play runs from Oct. 2 to 4 at the Adams Pool Theater.

The public imagination will remember United States Attorney General Eric Holder Jr., who announced his resignation last week, as the first African American to lead the Justice Department and as a close friend of President Obama. But beyond these distinctions, Mr. Holder’s legacy is a split one. On the one hand, he was a tireless advocate for the rights of underrepresented groups. On the other, he presided over the expansion of a surveillance apparatus put in place by the Bush administration, and in doing so ran roughshod over the rights he defended so well in other spheres. Holder’s Justice Department also failed to prosecute those in the financial services industry responsible for the recession.
One of Holder’s most crucial projects was his fight against regressive voting restrictions. He led the effort to undo restrictions on early voting and photo ID laws, and fought attempts to limit the Voting Rights Act. When the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of that law in 2013, Mr. Holder continued to resist a renewed push to implement laws that disproportionately affect the voting rights of underprivileged populations.
Holder’s tenure also saw significant progress on LGBT rights. He chose not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, Section 3 of which the Supreme Court subsequently voided. As legal commentator Jeffrey Toobin noted, under Holder “the Justice Department has committed itself to the idea that discrimination against gay people is unlawful.”  The Attorney General deserves credit for adopting this overdue position wholeheartedly and defending it effectively.
Holder deserves additional approbation for his support of criminal justice reform, which included denouncing the current epidemic of mass incarceration, allowing states to liberalize marijuana laws, and supporting a reduction in the sentences of non-violent drug offenders.
The issue of race inevitably pervaded Mr. Holder’s actions on criminal justice issues and voting rights, and he dealt with the topic admirably, if contentiously. His recent role in ensuring that the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, received real scrutiny exemplified Mr. Holder’s willingness to pursue civil rights cases seriously.
Unfortunately, this commitment to civil and political rights did not extend to every part of Holder’s record. Mr. Holder supported the Washington, D.C., police in arguing that GPS tracking did not require a warrant, a contention that the Supreme Court unanimously rejected. He also authorized the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of telecommunications data.
Perhaps most egregious were Holder’s stances on press freedom and targeted killings. In pursuing whistleblowers, searching the communications of journalists, and setting legal precedents that could jail reporters, Holder has undoubtedly diminished legal protections for journalists. And his Department’s arguments in favor of the targeted killing of American citizens represent a gross lack of concern for due process.
A final blemish on Mr. Holder’s record is his failure to pursue criminal actions against financial executives in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 crisis. Setting the precedent that banks and bankers are “too big to jail” has undoubtedly undermined public faith in the government’s ability to hold powerful economic actors accountable.
As many in the media have noted, Mr. Holder’s mixed record resembles that of his idol, Robert F. Kennedy. On issues of civil rights for underrepresented Americans, Mr. Holder has lived up to that admirable legacy. But both men had serious failings on government surveillance and executive power, with Holder also uninspiring on financial crime. For the nation’s first African-American Attorney General, these blind spots limit the substantive progress he achieved towards making the United States more just.

I write bearing both good news and bad. The good news is that Aretha Franklin just released a cover of “Rolling in the Deep.” The bad news is that summer has officially ended.
I’m sure you’re looking around, thinking, “No kidding. It’s been cold for the better part of a week, and I still don’t have a job!” Indeed, the time for long johns and even longer cover letters has arrived. And so forgive me for writing this paragraph while lying outside on Sunday, getting a last minute sunburn before the sun follows all of Quebec to Fort Lauderdale for the winter. You see, I am writing this from the past! Just think: Relative to me, you are in the future. Frankly, I find this whole setup very meta. Call a DeLorean, or a psychiatrist.
There are others, I’ve found, who find autumn to be a little bit of a downer. Just the other day, I ran into a visitor who stopped me in my hurried tracks. “Excuse me, do you know where I can find some uppers?”
“Umm, like coffee, or Prozac?” I’m not so sure we were on the same page.
Moods notwithstanding, the signs of change are all around us. The Jewish high holidays are in full swing, bringing with them all sorts of acts of repentance and essay extensions. Once the holidays start, we barely have a chance to catch our breath before they start all over again next year. Before you know it, we will be celebrating Hanukkah, then Free Pancake Day at IHOP, then Passover, all of which have their own culinary traditions and religious implications.
It’s been tricky of late, though, to figure out why someone is wearing a suit. Sometimes it’s for holiday services. Other times it’s for job interviews. Or it might be a sophomore or junior headed to a punch event. As former Harvard President Larry Summers so eloquently opined, “One of the things you learn as a college president is that if an undergraduate is wearing a tie and jacket on Thursday afternoon at 3:00, there are two possibilities. One is that they’re looking for a job and have an interview. The other is that they are an asshole.”
I suppose Harvard could have just birthed a small army of Brooks Brothers-clad sphincters, or the department store might have hired them all for what must have been an expensive marketing campaign. Or maybe there is a particularly large crop of applicants for Eleganza. I don’t really know.
What I do know is that I’ve spent far too much time watching these long processions of fashionistos. I also know that those walking around in suits do not leave much time for problem sets. Between picking out their multicolored socks, and tying their ties, and marching around, and untying their ties, the whole day is taken up!
I was watching one of these pageants the other evening, listening to some of the most ridiculous conversation I’ve heard since sitting in the back of Rosh Hashanah services, and right on cue a freshman took it upon himself to check his watch and realize that he was late for section, or lab, or whatever he had that particular evening. There is absolutely nothing more entertaining to a senior than watching a freshman run with a backpack, with the possible exception of watching multiple freshmen run with backpacks.
I already miss the lazy days of summer, when we hadn’t yet started looking for a place to spend the next few years, whether it be J.P. Morgan or the Porcellian. But the time has come to solve our problem sets and essays and finish Crimson articles that were apparently due an hour ago. After all, winter is coming.
Just don’t forget to listen to Aretha. It’s a pretty good upper.

To the editor:
On Monday, student activists gathered to mourn the deaths of those who lost their lives in Gaza (“Students Host ‘Dead-In’ To Commemorate Gaza Victims,” Sept. 29, 2014). Monday’s demonstration was not so much a recitation of statistics as a human cry on behalf of the suffering. So many lives are affected by the Israel-Gaza conflict. However, as we search for a way forward in the aftermath of this war, death should not be used as political capital.
This summer’s headlines, full of violence and discord, revealed the human toll of sustained and growing global conflicts. While my focus on the myriad issues facing humanity may flow with headlines, as an American Jew, my interests in the welfare of Israel are constant. For my friends who have committed their hearts and minds to the important cause of Palestinian rights and freedoms, I imagine the same holds true.
This summer was devastating for those of us seeking a peaceful future. During the 50-day Israel-Gaza conflict, the acting government of the Gaza Strip, Hamas, fired more than 4,000 rockets indiscriminately into Israel. Israeli air and ground actions not only exposed the extent of Hamas’ militarization of Gaza but also resulted in considerable Palestinian civilian casualties.
The vocabulary of this conflict has an enormous effect on how we perceive both war and the prospect of peace in the Middle East. In the case of Monday’s event, The Crimson reported that students “read the names and ages of the men, women and children who died in Israeli-Palestinian crossfire,” language that highlights the fact that the intrinsic chaos of a multi-faceted conflict has tragic and unintended consequences.
In contrast, the Palestine Solidarity Committee, which organized the event, claimed to have read the “names of over 2,000 Palestinians massacred by Israel this past summer” in its Facebook post describing the event. The choice of the word “massacred” suggests malicious, deliberate, and one-sided action from a hell-bent, demonic aggressor seeking to annihilate the innocent. The use of such vocabulary establishes a dangerous precedent of depriving Israel—a country of remarkable intellectual, ethnic, and spiritual diversity—of its most human qualities. When this is the rhetoric, it becomes increasingly difficult to view the citizens of Israel as human beings that share with many Palestinians their yearning for a peaceful future.
I will always stand firmly behind an Israel that is committed to security and peace. Times of war may test my ideals and my patience, but it is important for me, and for all of us, to remember that in Israeli and Palestinian policy, nearly every debate has existential implications for those most immediately affected. When the political left in Israel calls on the right wing to cease settlement development in the West Bank, this is rooted in a conviction that instead of security, continued and growing occupation will result in an intensified conflict that ultimately endangers the State of Israel. Conversely, the political right in Israel expresses the fear that a truly autonomous Palestinian state may not be able to fend off radical Islam, allowing organizations like Hamas and ISIS to encroach freely on the Israeli people.
Whatever astuteness and sensitivity we may have, Americans are not accustomed to such stakes in political discourse. Whatever decisions our politicians make and however we regard them, we do not generally fear that our country, or our people, may no longer be there in the morning. From a distance, Jews in Israel seem increasingly to be regarded as a local ethnic majority mishandling their responsibility for upholding the rights of a Palestinian minority. We cannot begin to facilitate peace until we learn to appreciate that most Israeli Jews see themselves as a tiny minority in a predominantly Muslim and historically hostile greater Middle East.
As is the case with many public demonstrations, Monday’s event elicits an emotional response at the expense of a more thoughtful opportunity for dialogue. My sincere prayer—a prayer that I feel hopeful is shared with the organizers of Monday’s event—is for us to begin a conversation rather than end one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Armed with my aunt and uncle’s Netflix subscription, I recently rekindled my obsession with a television show that I enjoyed as a child: “Numb3rs.” After binge-watching a few seasons, I set out to determine why this show still has such a draw on me.
For the uninitiated, “Numb3rs” is a crime show about the exploits of Charles “Charlie” Eppse, a genius math professor who helps his brother Don, an FBI agent, solve crimes.
Before delving into my affection for the show, I should note that “Numb3rs” is not without its problems. Alice Silverberg, a University of California, Irvine professor who consulted for the show, wrote an article during its run that detailed most compelling complaints against “Numb3rs.” Some of her observations—like her objection to the lack of mathematical rigor in each episode’s original script—are less problematic for me; I never really expected the math on the show to be particularly accurate.
But Silverberg is right to point out that the show’s female academic characters tend too often towards “sex object,” and that the romantic relationship between Charlie, a professor, and Amita, a graduate student at the beginning of the show, would pose serious ethical issues in real life. In addition, David, the show’s only African-American character, reflects the “black-character-as-perpetual-loyal-sidekick” trend in American TV.
Aside from these complaints, however, I think the show represents something better than the typical, gimmicky police procedural, largely because of the way in which it depicts the relationship between intellectual pursuits and public service.
One of the show's running themes is that Charlie—who was a math prodigy—is destined for great things in academia. As he becomes more and more absorbed in helping his brother solve crimes, however, he worries that he is wasting his academic gifts on less intellectually significant endeavors. Don has similar concerns.
Ultimately, the show suggests that public service is as noble a calling as pursuing the mysteries of the universe, and that the two are not mutually incompatible. Tension exists between science and the state in “Numb3rs,” most notably when Charlie wrestles with the implications of national security restrictions for the dissemination of knowledge to developing countries. But overall, the show presents an optimistic image of how government and academia can work together to improve lives. This conclusion may seem quaint or oversimplified, but it goes a long way towards explaining why I continue to enjoy the series.
As students, we hear quite a bit about becoming "citizen-scholars," about the need to use what we know in the service of others. We also know that many of us will go into lucrative careers in consulting and finance, careers that further the image of the elite education as a stepping-stone toward material gain.
We also hear a lot about the joy of learning for learning's sake, and we spend much of our time delving into abstract or obscure questions that can seem to have little practical value. This part of our education gives rise to an image of the elite college as haunt of star-gazing theoreticians who, like the astronomer in Chaucer’s “The Miller's Tale,” might walk into a terrestrial obstacle while studying the movement of celestial bodies.
What I like about “Numb3rs,” then, is that it presents a far more optimistic view of the role of education in public life. It points out that academic disciplines have serious real-world applications, that government should make use of those applications, and that academics have an obligation to the larger society. Put less romantically: As a student, thinking that what you are studying could save the world is fun. I like the show because it represents a well-crafted version of that idea.
On the other hand, it could just be the frequent gunfights. Those are cool too.

“Annenberg’s food today is just so awful!” countless people told me time and time again last year as we, the 1,600 Harvard freshmen, ate together in one gigantic dining hall. Poorly fried eggs, lack of variety, and an absence of Fruit Loops were just some of the complaints I heard. Now that my class has moved on to upperclassmen dining, with its more manageable cafeterias, I have heard less whining. All the same, sweet satisfaction is not something I often find amongst my peers while we eat in one of the 12 upperclassmen House serveries Harvard provides. But maybe the problem is a frame of mind more than it is the tastes of our tongues.
I was luckily born without a single food allergy. Neither nuts, shellfish, nor soy can hold me back from gorging myself when the time calls. And I would never be crazy and limit myself to eating only vegetables or, god forbid, avoiding animal products. Nope. Never. I am a carnivore through and through.
And so, given these characteristics, is it really fair for me to ever complain about the food Harvard cooks? Should I really tell myself, well, it’s finals season, so I deserve better? No. But I am not here to criticize food complaints, for, as a foodie who has devotedly watched four seasons of “Chopped”, several “Next Iron Chef” competitions, and every single “Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations” episode ever produced, I completely understand. I simply think that the case of food reflects an overall dilemma that permeates our chaotic
lives: We are too stressed to appreciate what is here, and too busy to allow ourselves to be creative. Two weeks ago, Business Insider published article entitled “19 Incredibly Impressive Students at Harvard.” Do not get me wrong. Every person on that list was incredibly impressive. But during discussions with my peers, the conclusion I most commonly heard was that the recognized students were also, paradoxically, incredibly standard. My point is not to discredit those who were awarded, but simply to point to the fact that their hectic schedules are the norm for nearly all Harvard students. Without a free moment to settle and relax, how can we objectively appreciate what is actually good? I speak not only to the dining food (don’t forget about our fantastic Veritaffles!) but also to our student body, our fantastic faculty, and even to our beautiful grounds. There are a lot of great things about Harvard, but I know all too well how easy it is to forget about them when we have no time.
Perhaps another issue with the food stems from a busyness that prevents us from being creative. When I enter the dining hall, the natural thing I do is scan the hot food options and then perhaps wander to the grill. Before club squash practice, I always go for pasta and bread, in the morning I consistently choose oatmeal, and lunch is always a toss-up. Maybe what I and others who find the food unsatisfactory at times really need to do is relax and ask ourselves, “What is my soul sandwich?”
As I sat outside the other day with three friends and our lunches on the Quad lawn, one friend happily enjoyed a sensational sandwich composed of a french roll, smoked turkey, melted pepper-jack cheese, lettuce, and Dijon mustard—all toasted to a beautiful brown. Our friend was satisfied with his meal, and we teased that he could sell it for $10 had he been in a gourmet shop. We laughed and admired his meal, but underlying his accomplishment was the fact that he managed to clear his mind and allow creativity to flow, finding his personal soul sandwich at last.
With all of this advice, I do not wish to undermine legitimate food restraints such as allergies or kosher dining. I merely think that all the meals, like our time at Harvard, would be further enjoyed if we took the time to appreciate what we have, and allowed our creativity to flow.

Everybody’s been talking about the similarities between the Isis Club and the militant group, ISIS. To ensure our readership is informed and capable of discerning the difference, we present a difficult, though informative, quiz. Choose which group provided the following quotes.
1. “We are a state implementing the Shariah in Iraq and Sham. We understand no borders—we have participated in battles in Sham and we will go to Iraq in a few days and fight there and come back. We will even go to Jordan and Lebanon with no problems.”
2. “Isis Club is a female social club, with a diverse membership consisting of about ninety current undergraduates.”
3. “We’re looking for girls who want to have a good time.”
4. “Ask yourself what prevents you and what keeps you behind. If it’s your wealth, your wealth won’t be able to delay death.”
5. “Through its commitment to excellence and leadership, the club provides resources for the personal and professional development of its members.”
6. “If your leaders whisper to you claiming it is not a caliphate, then remember how long they whispered to you claiming that it was not a state but rather a fictional, cardboard entity, until its certain news reached you. It is a state. Its news will continue to reach you showing that it is a caliphate.”
7. “The legality of all emirates, groups, states and organizations becomes null by the expansion of the khilafah’s authority and arrival of its troops to their areas.”
Answers: 1) ISIS - The Isis Club, in contrast, routinely faces problems when attempting to enter Lebanon. 2) Isis Club - The key word here is “undergraduates”; ISIS admits members of any educational background. 3) Isis Club - ISIS strictly prohibits anyone “want[ing] to have a good time.” 4) ISIS - Most members of the Isis Club believe their wealth will eventually grant them immortality. 5) Isis Club - ISIS, on the other hand, is solely concerned with their members’ professional development. 6) ISIS - The Isis Club hasn’t referred to itself as a “caliphate” since at least 2004. 7) ISIS - The Isis Club respects the sovereignty of most nations.

Always keenly attuned to the spiritual needs of our readers, Fifteen Minutes gazed skyward this week to assess the future. The best way to consult the oracles, we have learned, is by lounging on divans with sweet Ganymede, Zeus’s cupbearer, at our elbows. And so for you, our beloved readership, we swilled white wine and consumed grapes by the handful, charting out the passage of the stars and the alignments of the planets. Here are our pronouncements.
Aries
Our mystical sources tell us that Aries is the sign of the ram—specifically, the ram from the tale of the Golden Fleece. Sundry meanings have been attributed to said fleece, but one will prove especially pertinent this month: the rain cloud. FM’s astrological experts believe that this will be an especially damp October for Arians.
Taurus
The sign of the bull descends from the myth of the Cretan Bull—the bovine father of the Minotaur. Don’t say the heavens didn’t warn you when a bull-headed babe comes tearing into your life with an appetite for human flesh.
Gemini
Head to the dining halls of your life, Geminis, because this month is your feasting month. Castor and Pollux, the twin horsemen of Greek myth, are associated with theoxenia, the rite of “god-entertaining”—and it is harvest time, after all. If you’ve been wondering whether or not to ask that special faculty member to share a cup of coffee, the stars are in your favor.
Cancer
Cancer is based on the giant crab Karkinos, known for attacking Hercules. Sucks. Honestly, your outlook for this month is so bleak that we’re going to have to pour ourselves another few glasses of ambrosia.
Leo
The Nemean Lion, Leo’s mythological forebear, fought (and lost to) Hercules in the first of the hero’s twelve labors. This month, the sun will combust both Mercury and Venus, so all may not be fair in love or war. FM predicts a steamy Saturday romance and a stinging Sunday rejection. Sadly, you’re just the first of twelve for your Herc. We know, (s)he’s a jerk.
Virgo
The original Virgo was Astraea, the last immortal left standing when all the cool kids had rocketed off to Mount Olympus. Virgos tend to be a little slow on the uptake, and the upcoming lunar eclipse will only magnify that fault. Plan ahead on your Halloween costume, or you’ll be trick-or-treating over turkey come November.
Libra
Libras, it’s your birthday month, so we can tell you with absolute certainty what’s coming up for those under the sign of the scales: presents, booze, and cake. The fulfillment of all of one’s earthly desires may also be on the horizon.
Scorpio
Like Scorpius, the monstrous hitman Gaia hired to off Orion, you may find yourself doing some morally iffy stuff this month. Then again, Orion kinda deserved it.
Sagittarius
Once, I dated a Sagittarian. It didn’t go well.
Capricorn
The sign of the goat can trace its roots to Aegipan, or Goat-Pan. Plutarch relayed one Roman origin story for this strange creature: the incestuous offspring of Valeria of Tusculum and her father, Valerius. Yikes. Capricorns might want to consider asking any potential paramours this month for a copy of their birth certificate. And access to their mom’s Ancestry.com account, just to be sure.
Aquarius
Hyas, the water-bearer of myth, met a sad fate when wild beasts devoured him at the riverside. He just wanted to hydrate. With Mercury in retrograde, Aquarians should steer clear of the Charles, the water dispensers in the dining halls, and probably the MAC Pool, too. You can never be too careful.
Pisces
Some say the sign of the fish derives from the form into which Aphrodite and Eros shifted to escape the clutches of the monster Typhon. The moon rules Pisces, and so, with the lunar eclipse ahead, those born under this sign may find themselves desperate to get away. Brace yourselves, Pisceans: you may have to refill your CharlieCard this October.

2002: The Global Climate Coalition, a group of industrial corporations opposed to the Kyoto Protocol, dissolves after a national divestment campaign run by environmental activist Phil Radford.
Spring 2011: The first protests against investment in fossil fuels occur on U.S. college campuses beginning with Swarthmore College. According to Swarthmore Mountain Justice, the environmental advocacy group at the movement’s forefront, students began to pressure their school to divest its endowment from the largest 16 fossil fuel companies after witnessing the impact of coal mining on the Appalachian Mountains.
December 2011: Hampshire College, the first school to divest from South Africa during apartheid, also becomes the first academic institution to divest from fossil fuels.
2012: 350.org launches the ‘Go Fossil Free: Divest from Fossil Fuels!’ campaign across the country, calling for institutions to disinvest from fossil fuel companies. Divest Harvard is founded after Bill McKibben publishes “Climate Change’s Terrifying New Math” in the August 2012 issue of Rolling Stone. 72 percent of students vote to support the divestment of Harvard’s endowment during the 2012 UC elections.
December 2012: The city of Seattle commits to divest its daily operational budget, the first city in the world to do so.
April-June 2013: The cities of Berkeley, Calif., Boulder, Colo., and Ithaca, N.Y. commit to pursue divestment. Truro and Provincetown, Mass. commit to divest in May. In June, Providence, R.I. becomes the first state capital to commit to divest. Shortly after, Portland, Or. commits to pursue divestment.
July 2013: The Cambridge City Council votes to recommend that the city’s retirement board divest from fossil fuels.
October 2013: President Drew G. Faust reaffirms the University’s anti-divestment stance in a letter to the Harvard community. Boxtel, in the Netherlands, becomes the first municipality in Europe to divest.
March 2014: Alli J. Welton ’15, one of the student organizers of Divest Harvard, confronts University President Faust about Harvard’s stance on divestment as Faust walks across Harvard Yard, claiming that Harvard’s investments in the oil industry prevent the very research into renewable energy that it pursues. Faust responds, “That is not the case.”  The incident is videotaped and receives widespread coverage. Faust counters in an email to Divest Harvard, expressing her disappointment in their methods.
May 1, 2014: Harvard student Brett A. Roche ’15 is arrested for blocking access to Massachusetts Hall during Divest Harvard protests.
May 2014: Stanford University divests from coal.
June 2014: The British Medical Association divests from fossil fuels, the first medical organization in the world to do so.
September 2014: After the People’s Climate March, in  which many Harvard students take part, the Rockefeller Foundation commits to divest its $4.2 billion in assets away from fossil fuel companies. A few days later, the Church of Sweden announces its complete divestment. At this point, there have been over 180 commitments by cities and institutions to divest, more than double the committments as of January this year.

Jack puts his frosted mini-wheats one by one into his bowl, an American flag bib protecting him from small splashes of milk. Across the table, his sister Kate, in an understated red rose headband, lets her eyes wander over the Kirkland House dining hall. The two don’t seem to be too engaged in the conversation surrounding them, but that makes sense given their unique positions in the Harvard community: Two-and-a-half-year-old Jack and six-month-old Kate are Kirkland tutor babies. Between them sits a former tutor baby, Simone-Élise S. Hasselmo ’16, who spent her early childhood in the halls of Eliot House. These days, she lives in Leverett House as a Harvard undergraduate.
Simone and Jack were born in the same hospital: Brigham and Women’s in Boston. Jack goes to the same day care that Simone once attended: Soldiers Field across the river. And Jack’s favorite room in his House matches the one that used to excite Simone the most: the mail room.
“Growing up here was a lot of fun. I loved eating in the dining hall,” says Simone. While she doesn’t remember everything from her earlier time at Harvard, some things have stuck with her. “I remember super-cool undergraduate babysitters; I remember eating tofu in the dining hall. Weirdly, that’s one of my biggest memories. Raw tofu from the salad bar.”
Jack’s mother, Erin Walczewski, a Kirkland House tutor, interjects: “Was it the same tofu they have now?”
Simone’s nostalgic answer? “Yeah, yeah.”
Luke Walczewski, Jack’s father, also a Kirkland House tutor, expresses some concerns about raising Jack in the House. He wants to know if Simone can shed some light on how her parents dealt with similar challenges. “One thing that we’re worried about with Jack is that he’s not developing any sense of stranger danger because…he’s surrounded by adults, and everybody knows him. He’s everybody’s friend, and everybody gives him a high-five.”
Erin wonders aloud about how they should teach Jack about strangers. “Like, don’t talk to strangers, unless they’re one of the 500 people who live in this building?” Then she raises another question about growing up at Harvard. “Some of the things that I wonder about, are like, at what point will he realize that dishes are not usually done by putting them on a conveyor belt that takes the trays into a magic hole in the wall—you know what I mean? The kinds of things he takes for granted. I wonder how old he’ll be when he figures out that this is a special part of living at Harvard, and specifically in the Houses, and at Kirkland House, and not something that every toddler gets to do.”
“We did kind of learn that you have to wash out your own cereal bowl, and things like that,” Simone assumes.
Jack seems to be doing just fine: He uses a towel to wipe the milk he’s spilled on his tray.
For all of the unexpected problems that might come with raising a child in a Harvard House, Luke, Erin, and Simone agree that there are clear advantages. Erin recounts Jack learning how to shoot a basketball from members of Harvard’s Varsity Women’s Basketball team, and a group of guys in Kirkland teaching him the importance of crushing one’s cup after finishing a drink. Simone even had an undergraduate babysitter “drill feminism into [her] head.”
“My parents actually did a really fun thing when we were living here,” Simone recounts. “They got a bound journal for both my brother and I, and then every year at Commencement they would put it out and have Eliot residents who had interacted with me or my brother—and they’d go sign it, write us a message. Some of them are really short and just ‘oh, you were really cute and I enjoyed seeing you around,’ and some of them were like two page epics. They gave it to me on my eighteenth birthday. When I was young it wasn’t so interesting, but once I actually was talking and saying cute things, people would remember the things that I’d say and write them down.”
Luke and Erin exchange an excited and knowing look. “That’s a great idea. We’re stealing that,” says Luke.
There’s no question they’d have enough to fill a journal. “We have 350 neighbors that we know really well and that’s a really rare thing,” Luke remarks.
Growing up in Kirkland House appears to have instilled in Jack a powerful sense of community. “One of the things that Jack likes to say the most is ‘Go Harvard,’” says Erin. She and Luke once took Jack to the bar mitzvah of a boy—now a man— whom they used to babysit at Kirkland. Jack capitalized on his new, mysterious audience. “He yelled it in the middle of the bar mitzvah.” Luke picks up the story from there—“Like an hour in. Like stood up in the back, and yelled ‘Go Harvard!’”
The mere mention of “Go Harvard” makes total sense to Jack, who seizes the opportunity to exclaim “Go Harvard!” with practiced skill.
Simone, too, shares the feeling of belonging that Jack has just expressed so eloquently, and it has rooted itself deep within her. “Freshman year, every so often I’d be walking around or I’d be in a certain classroom building, and I would just be like ‘wait, I’ve been here before,’ and it was definitely before I could really walk or talk.”
In spite of supernatural déjà vu and unaltered tofu, seeing how well adjusted Simone has become seems to reassure Erin. “But it sounds like this didn’t mess you up for life,” she says, “because obviously you go to Harvard.”

The afternoon sun outside Cardullo’s aims right into my eyes, so that I have to squint to spot Fernando R. Espino ’15, president of Harvard’s Wisconsin Club.
I had originally planned to attend a Wisconsin Club meeting, but the group does not schedule organized gatherings, per se—more on that later. I needed another Wisconsin-related venue for the interview, and with an understanding of the state based mostly on “That 70’s Show,” only cheddar cheese and cow-tipping came to mind. Cheese was the more legal option, so I chose the deli for our venue.
Luckily, Espino, who arrives a few minutes late wearing a Harvard sweatshirt and a gray fedora, does not seem offended by my stereotyping. “I try not to go to the cheese section of stores,” he says, “because I will buy it.”
Cardullo’s cheese section contains plenty of Italian goudas and French bries, but its only American varieties hail from Vermont. We eventually settle on a Canadian brand of cheddar, which, without its “La Quebec” label, will do. To ensure authentic Wisconsin-ism, Espino suggests that we walk over to C’est Bon to buy a six-pack of Leinenkugel’s Sunset Wheat, whose label assures us that it has been brewed in Chippewa Falls, Wis. for five generations.
On the way to the liquor store, Espino promises that the brewery, founded in the late 1890s and now owned by Miller, remains true to its “Wisconsin essence.” It reminds him of fall at home.
Once we’ve laid out the cheddar, crackers, and beer, I’m a bit skeptical. Doesn’t cheese go better with wine? I ask Espino whether cheese and beer make a conventional couple in his home state.
“Yes!” he says eagerly, as the first slice of cheddar collapses into a pile of crumbs on his cracker. “But they’re usually paired with a third thing, which is hard to find on the East Coast. Have you ever heard of bratwurst?”
I have not. Espino explains that the German word refers to a hot dog-like thick sausage, often cooked in beer.
“Sometimes the bratwurst have cheese in them,” he says.
Cheese, beer, and bratwurst are typical fare at Packers games. The community-owned football team dominates social life in the state.
Going to a Packers game, says Espino—who otherwise prefers ballroom dancing—feels more like celebrating a birthday party than watching a football championship. “It’s like you’re at a family event, except your family is 80,000 people in a stadium or 15 strangers at Harvard.”
Indeed, meet-ups for Packers games at sports bars seem to be the primary activity organized by the Wisconsin Club, whose members converse over an e-mail thread called “CheeseChat.” Espino shows me a sample discussion:
Sun, Dec. 29, 2013, at 10:13 p.m.THAT WAS EPIC! For those who didn’t get to see the game, please see the highlights. AaronRodgers!
Da Bears still suck. That is all. Happy holidays!
Fernando
P.S. For those in Wisconsin, stay warm these next few days. The negative double digit windchills can be treacherous.
Mon, Dec. 30, at 2:05 p.m.:Da Bears suxxxxxxx.
Club members attend Packers-related events fairly regularly and get together in other social venues when the mood to reminisce strikes (a Wisconsite friend of mine, who describes a gathering of Harvard students from her home state as a “Wisconvergence,” recently told me that the best part of her day was spotting a stranger in green and gold). But their activities don’t seem to follow any sort of schedule. That, according to Espino, would defy the ethos of America’s Dairyland.
Pausing with cracker in air, Espino meditates: “Honestly, until I got to college I didn’t use this [Google] Calendar thing. In Wisconsin you just didn’t schedule things—you went with the flow.”
The Wisconsin Club, or the Wisconsin ethos, might be a way to counter the demands of busy and over-scheduled collegiate life. “In the Midwest, you don’t have to rush places. You get there eventually,” Espino says.
Our cheese has reached a state of near-total crumble, and Espino has to work on his Social Studies thesis. But I have one more question.
“Cow-tipping?”
“It’s a thing. It’s harder than it looks and sounds.”

You have an Avicii fixation. Your hipster friends only listen to the latest in Albanian folk metal. Who should be repenting and who should be rocking out? FM spoke to three professors to settle the score: John T. Hamilton, creator of “Frameworks: The Art of Listening,” Vijay Iyer, a jazz composer, pianist, and 2013 MacArthur Genius Grant recipient, and Hans Tutschku, an electro-acoustic composer.
What are you listening to right now?Hamilton: My listening habits have always been dictated by the fact that I perform. I’m not sure where my performance ears stop and where my pure, recipient’s listening ears begin. If I had to name three contemporary composers, I would list: Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Luigi Nono.Iyer: This morning, I was listening to Muhal Richard Abrams’ Experimental Band—”Live in Saalfelden.” They tend to focus on experimental, avant-garde music. This ensemble is a lot of my friends and mentors. I’ve learned from them and worked with them for the past 20 years. Tutschku: Karlheinz Stockhausen’s “For Times to Come,” Georg Friedrich Haas’ “in vain,” and Francis Dhomont’s “Frankenstein Symphony.”
Who do you think is the most underappreciated contemporary musician? What contemporary work has your ear?Hamilton: Nothing contemporary’s really grabbing me right now. Generational constraints [on music preference] are no longer applicable. Our tastes are developing in new ways, towards a new eclecticism.Iyer: I actually bought some music last night… FKA twigs… Another thing I was listening to was U. Shrinivas, who just recently and tragically passed away. [He was] one of the greatest Carnatic musicians of the last 20 years.Tutschku: It’s hard to apply these popular models of music to classical music. It’s probably not the same mindset as a contemporary classical composer. “Underappreciated” isn’t really a concept that’s applicable. If you look at composers, they’re probably all very much appreciated in a different audience which has some attachment to their work.
The infamous desert island question: you can only listen to 3 pieces for the rest of your life. What do you choose?Hamilton: The Beatles’ “White Album,” King Crimson’s “In the Court of the Crimson King,” Mahler’s 4th Symphony.Iyer: Jimi Hendrix’s “Band of Gypsys,” Michael Jackson’s “Thriller,” Duke Ellington’s “Money Jungle.”Tutschku: Karlheinz Stockhausen’s “Inori,” a recording of a Buddhist temple ceremony, Puccini’s “La Bohème.”

“Basically we want to teach you. We want to show you the ropes,” says Dylan F. Perese ’17. The ropes Perese refers to are actually cables: heavy-duty ones with the strength to suspend the 25-tons-worth of bells that he and the other members of The Lowell House Society of Russian Bell Ringers play every Sunday.
To become a Russian bell ringer, students must pass a comp, which begins in October. The comp process itself is fairly simple and hinges upon reliable attendance, according to club leaders. No previous experience necessary.
In order to play the bells at 1 p.m. every Sunday, compers are expected to show up 15 minutes earlier, even in inclement weather. “That’s the deal-breaker for a lot of people,” Perese says. “It gets pretty cold in the winter and pretty windy.”
On any given Sunday, the number of people in the bell tower varies. “Last Sunday we had about 30 people up there, but we’ve had as few as two or three,” Perese says. Sometimes a conductor directs the group to keep everyone in rhythm.
Together the ringers play anything from traditional Russian peals to top 40 hits to seasonal classics such as “Charlie Brown’s Thanksgiving Song”.
“Russian bell ringing is an art,” Lowell House Co-Master Diana L. Eck says. “It’s this piling up of sound. It’s much more like jazz because it’s improvisational.”
The bells create sound in a way similar to the strings-and-hammer system within a piano. Metal cords are threaded through different levels, and ringers pull on ropes to trill the bells.
First-time ringers can try their hands at any bell in the tower except for “Mother Earth,” the biggest bell, the crown jewel: it is close to nine feet in diameter and weighs over 13 tons. Instead, compers can test out “Mother Earth”’s resonant peers, whose names include “Sacred Oil” and “Famine, Pestilence and Despair.”
Once the comp is complete, new members receive keys to the bell tower on Russian Orthodox Easter.
“We’re probably one of the more inclusive student groups on campus in the sense that anyone is welcome to com e up with us, It’s a really great group of people,” Perese says. “It’s incredibly rewarding to be part of a larger religious and musical and cultural tradition.”

It’s early Saturday afternoon, and in the basement of the Graduate School of Education, people gather around a seminar table to intently edit Wikipedia articles. Next door, a group discusses the challenges involved with getting blog posts to count toward tenure tracks. Programming later today will range from exploration of text matching software, pioneers of synthetic synaesthesia, and the subtle difference between digital preservation and conservation.
This is the Humanities and Technology Camp (THATCamp), an “unconference” aimed at exploring issues related to the digital humanities: a rapidly evolving field at the intersection of tech, history, social media, literature, rights, music, and myriad other domains. The “unconference” is populated by passionate librarians, tech savvy grad students, innovative professors, and the like. This is the first time Harvard has hosted THATCamp, a series of global meetups independently organized to provide cheap or free ways for technologists and humanists to network and discuss ideas.
One session, called “Archives à la Carte” for reasons which will never become completely clear to me, is held in a multimedia classroom. When I drop by, the discussion centers on encoding the provenance of historical objects and ephemera like photos into their digital versions. The word “metadata” is thrown around a lot, as well as a snide reference to the apparent illiteracy of college students confronted with source documents: “Undergraduates interact better with images.”
At this point, one woman poses a hypothetical to the assembled group: “If I were digitizing a historical journal, and there were 53 blank pages, would you want me to scan and digitize all 53 blank pages?” She’s met with a few seconds of blank stares, and then the room erupts in a chorus of vehement yeses. One woman passionately likens excising the blank section to “stealing bread from my children’s mouths.” Another explains in a slightly patronizing tone that images of the pages are crucial because “you want to know what about them is blank.”
In between sessions, I talk with THATCamp organizers Judson Harward, Harvard University Information Technology director of arts and humanities research computing, and Christopher M. Morse, instructional computing specialist. Harward expresses a sentiment that I hear a lot throughout the day: One of the goals of THATCamp is to break out of the formality and rigidity that can plague Harvard events and, in fact, all aspects of Harvard academia. With this in mind, today’s “unconference” was apparently planned just this morning. After a series of briefs, called “dork shorts,” in which various speakers pitched their projects and ideas, attendees and organizers spontaneously planned the afternoon programming.
Sessions are intentionally quick, ensuring that neither presenters nor attendees, who Harward says include faculty, librarians, grad students and an errant undergrad or two, are forced to invest a lot of time into any single topic. “It can be playful,” Harward says of the conference. The purpose of the sessions isn’t necessarily to flesh out a practical interest, but to “get you thinking in a new way.”
Morse leads one of the afternoon sessions, an hour-long discussion on music visualization. He briefly presents his cyclochromatophone, a color-wheel-based keyboard which can be played online. The cyclochromatophone is just one of many unconventional modes for reimagining the musical scale, many of them synaesthetic, which will be a major topic of discussion. How can we avoid the biases of western music notation when transcribing non-western music? How do children visualize music before they’re taught a regimented system? Is it possible to create a program that identifies larger trends in much the same way that violinists don’t have to rely on sight reading each note in sheet music? These questions are all raised in the first ten minutes of the hour.

Harvard students like to multitask. I am a Harvard student. I’ve also been meaning to hang out with this cool chick. So I asked myself: why not murder two innocent winged creatures with one proverbial projectile? Our panel of judges: Me. My roommate. The Queer Crush I’ve been eyeing in Adams dining hall who has enthusiastically consented to appear in this article. Welcome to the four dollar wine date.
Purple Moon Merlot
($3.99/bottle. Trader Joe’s.)
The four dollar pickings are slim this week, so I ask Trader Joe’s Dude, a relentlessly hip guy with a nose ring, for suggestions. He indicates a sparkly white at $4.50, but I demure, as I have integrity.
Queer Crush: Do you have a brooding, sexual red?
Trader Joe’s Dude: Not in your price range.
Me: Do you have any reds that are weak and headachey?
Trader Joe’s Dude: [Points to Purple Moon.]
But Purple Moon, it turns out as we enjoy it sprawled on the very stained common room rug, is not weak, and I experience no headache after consuming rather too much of it. After weeks of wallflower whites, in fact, the Merlot is a font of complexity: a bouquet of dark chocolate and warm vanilla pudding, some sandalwoody notes of upper-middle-class yoga studio. This trope of rediscovered complexity and satisfaction is similar to the rhetoric my relatives are using to try to get me back on men, who also, presumably, have crème brulee overtones and aftertastes of Thai iced tea.
Green Fin
($3.99/bottle. Trader Joe’s)
This wine is not unpleasant; it is sweeter and less cringey than any wine I’ve tasted in this project. Roommate says it tastes cheap; I think it tastes expensive, and inform her that she tastes cheap, which is a classist and nonsensical comeback. Queer Crush claims that Green Fin has subtle notes of “that lemony smell that comes from garbage.” The bottle informs us that Green Fin’s aftertaste is focused, like a student who uses Adderall for study purposes in a culture that undervalues sleep, and I think it’s juicy, like a cute little clementine. All in all Green Fin is a rich wine; if it were a Harvard student, it would be disproportionately likely to be in the Porcellian.
Purple Moon Chardonnay
($3.99/bottle. Trader Joe’s)
Purple Moon Chardonnay smells quite nice: soft and not aggressive, like honey, yet with the subtle little bubbles that keep it sassy. In accordance with the general sexy-moody teenage-goth-chick Purple Moon aesthetic, the label sports a spooky picture of a moonlit sky.
Queer Crush: This label evokes Twilight, which reminds me of teenage sexual angst.
Me: Everything reminds me of teenage sexual angst.
At this point we decide to watch the “Rocket” video, in which Beyoncé presents a series of images that could also probably symbolize this wine’s flavor: a wet t-shirt; a squeezed lemon, a lit match, a key turning in a door, Mt. Everest under her panties. A plate of toast that falls and shatters.
If only this wine had overtones of Beyoncé.

Up at the Law School, in the recently constructed Wasserstein Hall, there’s a restroom with a curious moniker. A plaque outside the sleek facilities proclaims, to any and all, that they are in the presence of the “Falik Men’s Room.”
William A. Falik, a former lawyer and real estate developer who presently teaches law at UC Berkeley, has a history of renaming men’s restrooms. Nearly a decade ago, Falik made a donation to the Berkeley Repertory Theatre and succeeded in renaming a restroom in its Roda Theater the “Falik Gentlemen’s Lounge.”It’s important to note that other names were considered, including the “Gentlemen’s Falik Lounge,” and the “Gentle Falik Lounge,” though propriety eventually disqualified these two contenders.“We wanted to support the Berkeley Rep.,” Falik explains the initial donation, “and I thought it was somewhat humorous, to use the name Falik in association with a gentlemen’s lounge.”
Falik has been aware of the uniqueness of his name for a long time. “Growing up with this last name, you could take a lot of grief,” he explains. “I just turned it around, to being something, to me, that was humorous. That’s how I dealt with it.”In this spirit, Falik, who graduated from HLS in 1971, sat down to lunch a few years ago with then-Dean of Harvard Law School Elena Kagan. “She was doing what deans do, that is, raising money for the Law School,” Falik says.Falik’s father had recently turned 100, and Falik was looking to commemorate the event. “I was very interested in the public interest fellowship program that [Kagan] was championing, and I just said, ‘What if I were to give a hundred thousand dollars to the Law School?’”Kagan explained that a donation of that size would merit some form of naming rights, perhaps a classroom. “I said, ‘Elena, I really don’t have much interest in classrooms. Believe it or not, I’d love to name a restroom in the new Wasserstein Hall,’ and she looked at me and just started laughing. She thought that was great.”Like the “Falik Gentlemen’s Lounge” before it, the “Falik Men’s Room” ran into a few stumbling blocks. Initially, it, too, was meant to bear the name “Falik Gentlemen’s Lounge.” “But when that name was sort of bandied about at the higher circles of the Law School,” Falik explains, “they said it sounded as if it could be an association with a brothel.”Falik’s more modest acts of naming contrast, of course, with the recent high-profile renaming of both the School of Public Health and Faculty of Arts and Sciences deanship.When asked about these recent events and the current intensity of the capital campaign, Falik pleads ambivalence: “I can understand the tension around this.”“On the one hand,” he cedes, “it seems a little over the top to me.” He goes on to grant, however, that the money is likely doing good. “Institutions like the School for Public Health are enormously important to the welfare of society, and someone giving that amount of money could be of great benefit.”Falik’s family has long been involved in philanthropic activities, serving on several philanthropic boards, though he admits they rarely seek naming rights. “Often there are no naming rights associated with our contributions, which is fine with me, in our support of institutions and nonprofits,” he says.Falik has shown impressive restraint in not plastering his name on things every time an opportunity comes his way. As a real estate developer, he had countless opportunities to name roads in communities he had built. “But what are you going to do when you tell your friends, ‘I’ll meet you at the corner of Falik Road and Blank Avenue’? It just doesn’t happen.”Falik waits for the perfect moment, for the discrete opportunity. “I have always thought that by sticking with men’s rooms, I’m keeping a humorous profile, because basically there is a certain irony to it, as opposed to naming a hospital, or something like that.”Before ending our conversation, I ask Falik to imagine for a moment that he can bestow his name on any structure or institution in existence. What would it be? He suggests, perhaps, an obelisk, before recanting: “I’m not interested in naming buildings. I’m stuck on men’s rooms. If there’s an opportunity for a men’s room, that’s where I am.”

In light of the Venezuelan President's recent threat of legal action against a Harvard professor, here's a trip down the Harvard Faculty's extensive memory lane of lawsuits, threats, and accusations.
1849: A janitor, driven by curiosity, breaks through five layers of brick and finds the ghastly contents of a furnace. Inside: remains of a human thigh, pelvis, and shin.
The body parts—those of a missing man later identified as Harvard professor George Parkman, Class of 1809—formed the basis for the case against the only Harvard professor ever convicted of murder: Dr. John W. Webster, Class of 1811, a prominent chemistry professor at the Medical School.
The motive, it seems, was money. Webster owed Parkman, the victim, a loan of $2,432, a large sum, considering Webster's income was only $1,200 per year. Webster later confessed to killing Parkman in a fit of anger.
The case attracted much attention, and a later Crimson piece retroactively labeled it "the 19th Century's O.J. Simpson Case." On Aug. 30, 1850, in front of a crowd of thousands, Webster was hanged for the murder of George Parkman.
1916: Hugo Münsterberg, a professor of psychology, was an eminent supporter of German policies during World War I. In response to the accusations, then-Harvard president A. Lawrence Lowell wrote of “maintaining the principle of academic freedom, which has been severely strained by the present war.”
1983: Jorge I. Dominguez, Harvard's senior authority on Latin American political science, was stripped of his post for allegedly sexually harassing an assistant professor.
In response, the Government faculty unanimously adopted a resolution deploring sexual harassment. Dominguez did not attend the meeting, and some department members considered “proposing that Dominguez be forbidden from attending faculty meetings in the future."
1985: Nadav Safran, director of Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern Studies, told The Crimson's executive editor—three times—"I will kick your butt," one Thursday night. The Crimson filed a formal protest. No word as to whether Safran fulfilled his promise.
2005: A rising Economics professor, Andrei C. Shleifer ’82, was charged with “conspiring to defraud” the U.S. government after it was discovered that he invested in the Russian economy while simultaneously advising it.
In the 1990s, Shleifer led a failed Harvard economic advisory program to Russia that became embroiled in corruption. Ultimately, the U.S. government settled with Harvard for $26.5 million and with Shleifer for $2 million.
2008: Melvin D. Levine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, was accused of sexually abusing at least seven boys in his care.
Levine took his own life in 2011, the day after a class-action sexual abuse suit was filed against him in Boston. The lawsuit charged that Levine performed unnecessary genital exams on 40 boys while at Children's Hospital Boston.
2008: A professor was sued for a study he led on padded underwear meant to protect the elderly from hip fractures. The study concluded that hip protectors are not effective in preventing hip fractures. HipSaver, a hip protector manufacturer, alleged that the claim was damaging to its product. The lawsuit was dismissed.
2014: Liberation Music sued law professor Lawrence Lessig for using one of their songs as the backing track to a video. Unfortunately for Liberation Music, Lessig was, according to Flyby records, "kind of a big deal, especially when it comes to Copyright Law." Lessig countersued, won a settlement, then donated the money to open access.

Raynor J. Kuang ’17 knows more than you. As a member of the Harvard Quiz Bowl team, Kuang’s job is to remember trivia about every subject under the sun. In an act of astounding hubris, FM challenged Kuang to a 10-question round of Quiz Bowl in which we asked him 10 of life’s biggest questions. The following is a record of our heroic confrontation.
Question 1FM: According to Theocritus [thee-AH-krih-tuss], this mythical character loved a nymph who threw apples at his flocks. He threw the boulder that crushed Acis, the river spirit that was loved by that nymph, Galatea. He was mocked by his neighbors after nobody hurt him; that “nobody”—RJK: Ahh, so this is Polyphemus.
Verdict: It is Polyphemus. Point Quiz Bowl.Quiz Bowl: 1 FM: 0
Question 2FM: This next one is an actual Quiz Bowl question asked in a Harvard tournament a number of years ago:“This singer performs “Back in Time” over the end credits of Men in Black 3”—RJK: So, that is Pitbull.Verdict: Impressive and a little disturbing. Point Quiz Bowl.Quiz Bowl: 2 FM: 0
Question 3FM: What’s the heaviest thing you can lift?
RJK: How much do you weigh?
FM: 142 pounds.
RJK: Get over here.
Verdict: He lifted me as though I were as light as a feather. Point Quiz Bowl.
Quiz Bowl: 3 FM: 0
Question 4
FM: Which is swifter: a snake or a mongoose?
RJK: I don’t know, do we have a snake and a mongoose? You should work on that. The Crimson is falling behind the times. Without saying for sure, I’d have to say the mongoose. Because mongooses are pretty awesome.
Verdict: We looked it up. Whereas the fastest snake in the world (the black mamba) has a top speed of 12 m.p.h., the mongoose has a top recorded speed of 20 m.p.h. Point Quiz Bowl.
Quiz Bowl: 4 FM: 0
Question 5
FM: Mongooses or Mongeese?
RJK: A subject of great scientific debate. I fall on the Mongooses side.
Verdict: Dictionary.com falls on the Mongooses side as well. Point Quiz Bowl.
Quiz Bowl: 5 FM: 0
Question 6
FM: How much would it cost to buy your love?
RJK: Don’t you know, it doesn’t cost much. … I have no idea how that song goes actually, I’m sorry.
Verdict: We aren’t even sure what song he was talking about. Shameful. Point FM.
Quiz Bowl: 5 FM: 1
Question 7
FM: What was Sylvester Stallone’s first film credit?
RJK: Wasn’t it a porn film? It was a porno, wasn’t it?
Verdict: Stallone’s first film credit is the softcore pornography “The Party at Kitty and Stud’s.” Impressive and suspicious. Point Quiz Bowl.
Quiz Bowl: 6 FM: 1
Question 8
FM: Who the hell do you think you are?
RJK: Who the hell do you think you are?
Verdict: A clear tie.
Quiz Bowl: 6 FM: 1
Question 9
FM: What is my mother’s maiden name?
RJK: Joshua.
Verdict: Apparently this one was beyond Kuang’s intellectual capacity. Point FM.
Quiz Bowl: 6 FM: 2
Question 10
FM: What number am I thinking of right now?
RJK: Trick question. You’re not thinking of a number right now.
Verdict: Kuang’s right. I was thinking about Sylvester Stallone’s first film credit. Point Quiz Bowl.
Final Score—Quiz Bowl: 7 FM: 2

We gathered with the rest of the Harvard students and alumni at the start of the march, surrounded by new parents and passionate divestors, Guy Fawkes-masked teenagers and shirtless “environment bros” (or so the body paint smeared on their bare chests proclaimed). A serenely smiling blond girl brandished a hand-lettered sign beside me: “More trees, less assholes.” A gray-haired alumnus nearby in the crush of people gestured to the sign with a smile. “That’s great,” she said. “Of course, it should be ‘fewer assholes.’ But still.”—Emma K. Talkoff
The marching crowds are not angry. They have stickers on their cheeks declaring, “This is what an ecosocialist looks like,” and hold banners aloft. They smile, pose for photo ops, accept bits of marketing ephemera. Every other sign has a URL and a Twitter handle inscribed beneath its slogan. The marchers are families, students, activists, lawyers, start-ups. As they round the bottom of Central Park, past the soaring towers of the Time Warner Center, past the liveried doormen and the carriage horses, going nowhere today, the crowds break into song. We shall overcome, they sing, and everyone, everyone, knows the words. —Marina Molarsky-Beck
There was the woman with a sprig of kale sticking out of her shirt pocket; the high schoolers who led the march with chants of “Justice!”; the musicians’ union playing and dancing across 59th Street; mental health workers carrying signs proclaiming that “Anxiety is Appropriate” when it comes to climate change. But best of all, though there aren’t pictures or videos to prove it happened, was the five-year-old girl marching behind me who turned to her mother and asked, earnest and excited, “So we’re making history?” —Amy L.

Skis and skates are strewn all over the weathered floor. Maps of the world and photographs that seem to be ripped straight from the pages of National Geographic line the paneled walls. There are no beds, but sleeping bags stack all the way to the ceiling. Crowded cabinets and bookshelves are counterbalanced by a random array of plush chairs and couches. This is not a wood cabin settled in the snowy mountains of Utah: nestled within the brick walls of Adams House, this is the office of the Harvard Outing Club.
Founded over a century ago, the Outing Club’s initial goal was to get the Harvard community out of doors and beyond their collegiate jungle to explore nature around them. The club still operates in the same fashion, providing all of the necessary gear to interested students directly out of its Linden Street office. Though Outing Club resources are open to anyone who craves the great outdoors, many students find it difficult to venture “off the map” in the hectic weeks of midterms and punch season.
From musical to literary, Harvard student organizations of every genre seem to agree with HOC’s sentiment. Groups such as the Advocate Fiction Board, Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, and Harvard Dance Team make the trek to far away places (kind of) in order to get in touch with nature and bond with each other in an environment that tunes out the distractions of the University.
While many of these outings are longstanding traditions, some club leaders have established these trips during their tenure at Harvard after realizing the significance of an experience that transcends the school’s walls. Julian C. Lucas ’15, president of the Advocate and a member of the magazine’s Fiction Board, decided to revive the dead custom of hosting a camping trip to the Mohawk Trail State Forest after finding old pictures of graduated members on such past trips. “I think you can enjoy nature without being ‘outdoorsy,’ which is a word I hate,” Lucas wrote in an email, speaking to the decidedly sedentary nature of literature.
These clubs share a belief in the immense value of leaving Harvard campus to explore somewhere new. Fernando Espino ’15,  President of the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team explains that “there is some segmentation on our team between those who have just started and those who are in it. As much as we try to mitigate that difference, we realize that we are not always successful.”
This gap in the organization led to a need for the integration of new members using unconventional methods. The team recently traveled out to Cape Cod in order to break down barriers and adjust comfort levels within the group. While the act of ballroom in and of itself exceeds the typical boundaries of personal space, time apart from classes and work schedules allow the members to bond beyond the rehearsal room. Espino notes that on these outings, “what matters is not what you do outside of ballroom; it’s that you do ballroom.”
Many find it almost impossible to interact without feeling the innate pressure of campus life. Harvard students inevitably accumulate individual stressors as a result of the fast-paced and high-stakes setting. While groups go on retreats for a number of reasons, one thing they have in common is “that you’re not on campus,” says Daniel J. Fulop ’17, President of HOC. “It clears your mind, it relieves stress, it gives you a different perspective. Some go overboard and say it’s life-changing.”
Life-changing may be an exaggeration, but stepping out of what many have deemed the “Harvard Bubble,” in reference to the isolated college environment of exams, drama, and intrinsic anxiety, does wonders for both the dynamic of the club and the attitude of its members. These outings provide a peaceful setting in which to form lasting relationships. “Given that most of our time as a group is spent making noise, retreats also allow us to get to know each other in a way that rehearsal doesn't,” says Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra Vice President Aaron Roper.
Whether you’re a hardcore canoe-building, wood-chopping, leaf-wiping adventurer, or someone who’s worst nightmare is a FOP camping excursion, retreats benefit an astonishingly wide range of student personalities. As Lucas points out, while on retreat, “You can give your friends and your surroundings your full attention, and realize how hard it is to do that here.” The HOC is rapidly increasing their training class and advertising more opportunities for all members regardless of skill level or amount of Harvard-induced stress. Whether joining the HOC or retreating with a different club, the community-building aspects of the process transcend the location. And with destination names like Mount Moosilauke or Mount Chocorua, who could resist?

UPDATED: October 2, 2014, at 3:15 p.m.
In early March, Alli J. Welton ’15 sat with some of her fellow Divest Harvard activists in the front row of Sanders Theatre. In bright orange shirts, they rose to follow Drew G. Faust out of the building after the University president’s Junior Parents Weekend address, with a camera in tow.
In the Science Center Plaza, Welton presented Divest Harvard’s impassioned argument in favor of divestment while her group filmed Faust’s reaction. In doing so, the campaign was gambling that the benefits of increased attention outweighed the potential cost of straining their already tenuous relationship with the University administration.
“When the fossil fuel industry is standing in the way of our politicians doing anything about climate change, it’s absolutely clear that we have to do something to decrease their influence over the political system,” Welton, then student outreach co-chair for Divest, explained as she caught her breath in the windy Science Center Plaza.
Faust, bundled in a dark blue scarf, remained silent with her head tilted downward until Welton tossed a heated question at her: “If Harvard doesn’t help us, who do we turn to?”
“Harvard does help you,” Faust responded. “Harvard helps by making discoveries that enable this transition, by exploring—”
Welton cut in, “But the fossil fuel company stands in the way of their implementation.”
“That is not the case,” Faust said.
The video, which Divest uploaded shortly after the encounter, fades out after that line. Faust later chided Divest’s chosen means of protest and elaborated further her reasons against divesting.
In the following months, the group’s interactions with University officials went much further than a brief confrontation through the Yard with Faust. Divest Harvard became more ardent and more active, culminating in an early morning arrest of member Brett A. Roche ’15 outside of Massachusetts Hall in early May.
Divest Harvard’s recent escalation is the outgrowth of a sense of frustration at a University president and Corporation, that to them, are too secretive, too dismissive, and too unresponsive to their fervent calls. The three meetings Divest Harvard have had with members from the Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, a body that advises Harvard Management Company on managing its $36.4 billion endowment, have been been “private...off-the-record and not recorded,” as stipulated in emails from HMC  to Divest Harvard obtained by The Crimson, and have led to no tangible results.
But as Divest turns to these more extreme campaign tactics, there’s a concern within the organization that they will lose support from Harvard’s student and faculty bodies.
Activists say that the importance of divestment is not readily apparent in the type of cost-benefit analysis that is the go-to mode of critical thinking on Harvard’s campus.  According to Divest Harvard’s website, divestment’s goals are threefold. They aim to halt investment in fossil fuel industries, divest direct holdings in the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies, and divest indirect holdings in such companies within the next five years.
Harvard is a linchpin in their movement, because, with its historic prestige and power, members believe it can sway popular opinion against the fossil fuel industry and, more specifically, the industry’s influence on Capitol Hill.
The University is caught between two seemingly disparate roles—one as one of the world’s leading research institutions, promoting green research and initiatives, and the other as an investor of the world’s largest University endowment, directing portions of its funds towards the fossil fuel industry. Other higher education institutions, notably Stanford, are finding their stakes in fossil fuels increasingly unconscionable, but Harvard itself has made no intentions to divest. Still, the protests continue.
Chloe S. Maxmin ’15 first read about the idea of divestment in the summer of 2012, in a Rolling Stone article by William E. McKibben ’82 that proclaimed, “we’re losing the fight, badly and quickly—losing it because, most of all, we remain in denial about the peril that human civilization is in.” McKibben’s tally of the environmental damage created by fossil fuel use prompted Maxmin to look into 350.org, founded by McKibben, where she learned more about the divestment movement. By fall of 2012, Maxmin had founded Divest Harvard.
“I’ve been an activist, since I was about twelve years old. My whole focus up until the summer before divestment was on advocacy—changing light bulbs, doing energy audits,” Maxmin says. “But then I learned about the power of the fossil fuel industry and the influence they have in, what I once thought was my idyllic state of Maine.”
After Divest’s founding, the group quickly gained members. For Benjamin Franta, a graduate student who is working to build Divest’s alumni network, joining the group marked the first time he became involved with activism.
“When I went to my first rally, I was nervous,” he says. “I still get a little nervous at rallies.”
Franta, a doctoral candidate in Applied Physics and a predoctoral fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, spends most of his days in the lab, where he researches solar technology.
“I felt like part of my life is doing research in the lab on stuff that will maybe never make it to market and, if it does, only after ten years,” Franta said. With Divest, on the other hand, he felt that was making a more immediate impact in the fight against climate change.
McKibben also helped develop Franta’s interest in divestment. A McKibben lecture led him, in the fall of 2012, to attend the first meetings of the Divest Harvard student organization.
In the years since then, Franta has headed Divest’s faculty relations and alumni relations operations—work that he says some of his academic colleagues might rebuke.
“A lot of technocrats find it difficult to see the purpose of social movements,” Franta says.
He’s noticed that, in response to the threat of climate change, academics in the social sciences and hard sciences are more focused on solutions that attack the economic conditions and technological constraints that leave the fossil fuel industry with a monopoly on energy services. Franta, however, says that there is also a need for a social movement to attack the popular indifference towards the fossil fuel industry that allows it to continue.
Franta believes that academics think about the issue differently depending on their field. “Economists will say, ‘What you’re doing is a waste of time. What you need is a carbon tax.’ Scientists will say,  ‘What you’re doing is a waste of time. ­What we need is better solar technology.’ The historian would say, ‘absolutely, we need a social movement,’” Franta says. “Because that’s the way they’re used to looking at the world.”
Canyon S. Woodward ’15, co-coordinator of Divest Harvard along with Sidni M. Frederick ’17, believes that a social movement to create stigma around the fossil fuel industry is particularly important, not only for the environment, but also for human rights. He argues that a social movement will do more to denormalize the actions of the industry than either scientific research or overt political action.
When we meet, he speaks deliberately and dons dark sandals and a picnic red and white checkered button-down shirt with three buttons loosened. His Macbook Pro is clustered with worn stickers that announce things like: “Raft Naked,” “Not all who wander are lost,” or “I Climbed the Brooklyn Bridge.”
He explains that divestment is not just about protecting nature; it is about protecting people—particularly those in the developing world.
“The Maldives and other nations are literally going under water,” Woodward said. He added that while the United States can weather events like Hurricane Sandy, countries like the Philippines, which lack easy access to money and technology, simply cannot.
The “climate justice” aspect of divestment is, according to Woodward, what inspires him and other Divest Harvard activists who are willing to do anything for their cause. “We get climate change in a human way,” he says. “A way that other people, going about their day-to-day busy lives, understandably, don’t.”
This semester, Divest Harvard plans to continue asking Faust to hold an open meeting and is organizing a community-wide fast from Oct. 20 to Oct. 24.
The majority of Faust’s responses to the divestment movement have been through open letters. The 67 year-old former historian publicly entered the discussion with her first open letter in early Oct. 2013. Members from Divest Harvard maintain that they still are awaiting an in-person, open conversation with Faust. The president, for her part, told the Faculty in May that she had met with proponents of divestment at least seven times.
In her first open letter, she wrote that divestment is neither “warranted or wise,” based from manifold criticisms of the reasons for divestment. Foremost, Faust critiqued the use of a university endowment as part of social movements and stressed that restricting investments in large sectors “come at large economic costs.”
“The funds in the endowment have been given to us by generous benefactors over many years to advance academic aims, not to serve other purposes, however worthy,” Faust penned, further cautioning imposing political initiatives to the endowment.
“We should, moreover, be very wary of steps intended to instrumentalize our endowment in ways that would appear to position the University as a political actor rather than an academic institution. The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change,” she wrote.
Despite propagating economic motives that run contrary to divestment in her nearly 1,300-word first open letter, Faust took aim at a perceived contradiction in the divestment movement.
“I also find a troubling inconsistency in the notion that, as an investor, we should boycott a whole class of companies at the same time that, as individuals and as a community, we are extensively relying on those companies’ products and services for so much of what we do every day,” she wrote.
After Faust released her first open letter, Divest Harvard continued to meet regularly in Hampden Hall and Quincy’s Spindell Room on Monday and Thursday evenings, crafting and debating how to best to engage the University.
On a frigid and snowy Valentine’s day, the group delivered nearly 100 less than romantic construction paper cut-out valentines, all strung together with twine, to Faust.
Light-hearted, but pointed, one read: “Roses are red, violets are blue. Fossil fuels stink…u know its true.” And another: “Fossil fuels don’t deserve your <3.”
A more sensual one, wholly embroidered with small red hearts, read: “I’m not dirty, so be my valentine.”
In April 2014, after the video encounter with Welton, Faust issued a second open letter, which focused on the ways that Harvard’s academics lead in climate change research.
“People at Harvard make extraordinary contributions,” Faust wrote, “that in time can help society’s most complex and intractable problems seem amenable to effective solutions.”
The role of University investments was less important, she continued, relative to the contributions of “faculty, students, staff, and alumni” in the school’s fight against the climate change threat.
“Harvard will contribute to confronting climate change not through presidential pronouncements, and not through a sudden burst of eureka moments,” the letter read, “but through the steadfast, unrelenting commitment of faculty, students, staff, and alumni.”
While Faust believes that Harvard’s answer to climate change lies in academic research, many among Harvard’s faculty maintain that the University’s response must include divestment. This stance has led to Harvard Faculty for Divest, a group of faculty members that engages with the University through discursive means.
From November to April last academic year, a cohort of five professors, spanning vast fields of interest, met behind the scenes to draft a detailed rebuttal to Faust’s letter. At the same time, they were recruiting support from fellow faculty and staff members.
The five faculty members—James M. Recht, Joyce E. Chaplin, James T. Engell ’73 , Richard F. Thomas, and Eric S. Chivian ’64—worked through through countless revisions and reams, to give an initial written response to Faust.
The final product was an answer to Faust’s first open letter.
“Divestment is an act of ethical responsibility, a protest against current practices that cannot be altered as quickly or effectively by other means,” they wrote. “The University either invests in fossil fuel corporations, or it divests. If the Corporation regards divestment as ‘political,’ then its continued investment is a similarly political act, one that finances present corporate activities and calculates profit from them.”
The letter, which initially garnered the support of over 100 faculty signatures and now counts the support of 164, asserted that “no evidence exists that planned divestment would damage Harvard.”
In response to Faust’s position in her letter that the University ought to leverage its influence as an investor, the faculty letter stated: “It seems self-contradictory to argue that Harvard owns a very small percentage of shares in a group of stocks (shares that, moreover, represent a small percentage of its own holdings) yet can nevertheless exert greater influence on corporate behavior by retaining rather than selling that stock as protest. If Harvard were a major shareholder, that argument might make sense, but Harvard is not.”
Today, Harvard Faculty for Divest counts 16 principal authors. History of Science professor Naomi Oreskes, one of them who specializes in analyzing climate-change deniers and fossil fuel industries, says that she finds it unreasonable to support companies that have historically gone to great lengths to undermine environmental research, including Harvard’s.
“The fossil fuel industry has worked to challenge that evidence, to undermine it, to question the integrity of the scientific researchers, to—in some cases—harass them personally,” Oreskes explains by phone from Washington, D.C., having earlier in the day testified before Congress on how fossil fuel industries spread doubt on scientific research. “Organizations have been involved with linking scientists to terrorists.”
Oreskes reached out to Faust after the March video with Welton surfaced. She recounts that she told Faust, “I’ve worked on the history of the fossil fuel industries. They’ve tried to block action on climate change. If it would be useful or helpful to talk about what I know on the issue, I’d be happy to meet with you.”
Oreskes, who will be part of an Oct. 26 forum hosted by Harvard Faculty for Divest, said she met with Faust for an hour after Divest Harvard’s video was posted, though Faust has never openly mentioned the meeting.
“As a university dedicated to knowledge...it’s unconscionable to me that we would be investing in—supporting—organizations who have done work diametrically opposed to our mission as an academic, scientific, and research organization,” Oreskes says, while acknowledging that she thinks there are departments at Harvard that receive funding from companies in the fossil fuel industry.
Faculty for Divest members relate widely different motives and backgrounds for their engagement in the movement.
Recht, a principal author of the letters, traces his involvement back to McKibben’s Rolling Stone piece and his own advocacy efforts to get the City of Cambridge to divest its public pension funds from fossil fuels. The campaign was ultimately unsuccessful.
He notes that it has not been immediately straightforward as to how faculty members should engage with the University in the discussion of divestment or Divest Harvard itself.
“How does our group of faculty interact with or synergize with Divest Harvard? I don’t have a simple answer to that either. But I’ll tell you that we struggle with it,” Recht explains. “The way to move things forward hasn’t always been real clear-cut to us.”
The groups have worked together in a number of ways, including routine communication between some of the faculty members and Divest Harvard. Maxmin, Divest Harvard’s c0-founder, manages the website and email account for Harvard Faculty for Divest. Additionally, members from Harvard Faculty for Divest and Divest Harvard travelled to Manhattan in late September for the People’s Climate March, the largest ever climate-change demonstration.
Recht articulates the involvement of faculty pushing for divestment as somewhere in the middle of an arched spectrum, ranging from supporting the University—its President, its other faculty, its research, and goals—and on the other end, being there wholly for the students.
“We’ve taught [students], arguably, what’s right,” Recht says, “So in doing our daily work and what we get paid to do as teachers, we’ve taught, and now we’re faced with a situation where the students come back and say, we’ve learned what’s right.”
After Faust’s letter in Oct. 2013, Divest Harvard members say they wrestled with the feeling that the movement was stagnating. They had been demanding open communication with Faust for months, but had never been granted the opportunity to meet with her. In the face of the administration’s resistance, morale in the club was dwindling, even as the movement for divestment was gaining the support of faculty.
“Especially in the wake of [Faust’s] letter and the ‘no,’ there was this feeling of ‘Where do we go from here?’ It took the wind out of our sails in a lot of ways. There was a decline in participation,” Woodward says.
The University, by April, signed a United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment and the Carbon Disclosure Project’s climate change program. These initiatives provide a framework for considering environmental and social issues when investing and also push investors to be transparent about the environmental effects of portfolio companies. During the 2013-2014 academic year, Harvard Management Corporation was also hearing input on its investment decisions from its first-ever vice president for sustainable investing, Jameela Pedicini, whose hiring was announced in July 2013. Still, though, Divest saw the developments as more symbolic than substantive.
On April 30, Divest Harvard escalated its campaign with its most confrontational tactic yet—an involved barricade of Massachusetts Hall, home to Faust’s office and the central administration.
Early before sunrise, Divest Harvard members descended on the Yard and crept towards Mass. Hall, with banners and Dunkin Donuts provisions.
Two tents, one red, one blue, were pitched on the Matthews side of Mass. Hall. Several Divest members, their bright neon orange shirts clashing against the backdrop of the maroon brick, blockaded the main entrance to the building.
Activists, bundled and hooded, chanted with megaphones and bore signs demanding an open meeting. Even amid the cold and at one point chilling rain, Divest Harvard continued their protest into the next day.
At around 7:00 a.m. on May 1, as all three entrances of Mass. Hall remained blocked, the demonstration took a sharp turn.
According to Franta, Faust’s senior special assistant, Lars P.K. Madsen, was prevented from entering the building. Brett A. Roche ’15 was arrested after refusing to comply with Harvard University Police officers who asked him to move away from an entrance. Though charges were later dropped, fury around the arrest ignited, with many professors and students admonishing the University’s decision to arrest, rather than engage.
Recht characterized the University’s response to the demonstration as “terrible.” According to him, its actions clashed with what he and other faculty members see as the University’s mission—“to grow a civic sense of belonging and citizenship and responsibility” in young adults.
Harvard Faculty for Divest released a brief response after the incident, comparing the arrest to notable civil disobedience in history.
“[This action] echoed the arrest of students protesting civil rights violations in the 1960s, of Henry David Thoreau protesting the Mexican War and slavery, and of Bill McKibben protesting a possible Keystone XL pipeline,” Harvard Faculty for Divest wrote.
The demonstration brought the group into raw opposition with University powers and was a point of contention for months to come, one that would later influence Faust to exclude students from the open dialogue she said she planned to have with faculty in the 2014-’15 academic year.
For Kelsey C. Skaggs, a member of Divest Harvard and president of Harvard Law Students for Sustainable Investment, the arrest was troubling due to its treatment of free speech.
“The whole idea of not listening to student speech when it’s presented in the context you want,” says Skaggs, referring to Divest’s attempts to engage with the administration in the year and a half before the blockade, “and then shutting it down and being derogatory about it when it’s something you don’t want is really troubling from a free-speech perspective.”
Following the arrest, Faust criticized Divest Harvard for repeatedly turning to uncivil behavior as a means of engagement.
“Blocking the entrance to buildings, following and videotaping me and then editing and posting my words in ways that misrepresent them are not part of reasoned and civil discourse,” Faust told The Crimson several days after the arrest.
While Faust said she was committed to free expression in the community, she believed that Divest Harvard had exceeded the bounds of free speech when it began “infringing on the rights of other community members to conduct their normal activities.”
Rather than deflating Divest Harvard, as Woodward describes, the blockade of Mass. Hall and the ensuing arrest reinvigorated the organization, bonding the activists and drawing more attention to their work from observers, both on and off campus.
According to Woodward, Roche’s arrest, which quickly attracted national media attention, was the first arrest in the nationwide divest movement, and the blockade of Mass. Hall inspired similar actions of civil disobedience throughout the country.
“Going to Harvard—there is that name-brand recognition that picks up attention and then it just sprouts outward,” said Woodward. “There’s definitely a sense of being one of the campaigns...that this nationwide movement looks at.”
Whereas divestment activists in Cambridge have been met with a chilly response from the University, Harvard’s Californian counterparts have had markedly different results. Last year, Stanford divested from coal, widely known to be one of the most carbon-emitting fossil fuels.
Sophie Harrison, now a junior at Stanford and one of the founders of Fossil Free Stanford, recounts her initiation into climate-change activism in much the same way as Maxmin and Recht. After reading McKibben’s Rolling Stone piece, Harrison began to research real-world results of climate change and efforts to curb it. By fall 2013, Fossil Free Stanford had formed and even Skyped in members from Divest Harvard for one of its first meetings.
“It’s been growing and building. It’s been exciting checking off milestones one bit at a time,” Harrison says.
Starting the divestment process, in the spring of 2013, Harrison and her fellow activists submitted a two-page document—barely 300 words long—for the review of one of Stanford’s investment oversight bodies, called “the Advisory Panel on Investment Responsibility & Licensing (APIRL). APIRL is tasked with providing advice on investing endowment resources in companies that “could cause substantial social injury.”
In fall 2013, months after Fossil Free Stanford submitted the review request, members from the group presented their case to the full board of the APIRL.
“When I got out of the meeting with the full panel at the beginning of last year, it hadn’t even occurred to me that we’d be divested by coal by the end of the year,” Harrison recounts. “I think that was a huge, huge, and wonderful surprise for everybody in our campaign, a moment to show that student campaigns, student voices, the work that we are doing really can make a difference.”
Mindful of chronology, Harrison quickly contextualizes her group’s achievement within the Harvard arrest, drawing a distinction between Stanford and Harvard’s situations.
“I don’t think it’s necessarily a coincidence that Stanford’s divest from coal happened the week after Harvard was arresting students for a similar campaign,” Harrison says. “I think it’s just a national show of power, of what student campaigns are possible across the country, and we’ve been fairly lucky to have such a receptive administration so far, it turns out.”
The presidents of Stanford and Harvard, one university partially divested and one not, recently co-wrote an op-ed in the Huffington Post on the obligations of universities to devote resources to combating climate change.
“We in higher education must continue to step up,” the op-ed by Faust and President John L. Hennessey reads. “Universities have the opportunity and obligation to look toward the long term.”
Furthermore, the op-ed spoke of the need for universities to pursue “powerful long-term solutions without becoming subservient to near-term economic interests or partisan political concerns.”
The proverbial elephant in the article, albeit greener than grey, was divestment. Though many divestment advocates are convinced that the University dedicates itself to sustainable research and efforts on campus, they still believe that Harvard can help curb climate change, through divestment, more substantially and immediately.
“When [Faust] makes this change and says, we were wrong, and we are changing that, then people are really going to see that’s the meaning of being in leadership of the world’s greatest university,” Recht says. “That’s what a leader does. That person will say, ‘we’ve learned from this. We wanted to do the right thing. We’ve always worked at doing the right thing and when we’ve made an error, and we’ve made an error here, we get it. We know that. And we’re gonna make it right.’”
However, skeptics caution that Harvard and its peers in the Ivy League are fundamentally conservative institutions, unwilling to take on the risks associated with leadership.
McKibben is one such critic. He calls Harvard “a very old and conservative institution,” pointing to its hesitation to divest from South Africa in the 1980s when he was an undergrad.
McKibben believes that Harvard, and its fellow Ivy League institutions will divest eventually but only after other universities have taken the lead.
“The walls are covered with ivy, because they’ve been there a long time,” McKibben says. “These are no longer path-breaking institutions. They’re increasingly ceding that mantle to others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mayday, a political action committee launched by Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, has raised over $6 million since the spring, according to Federal Election Commission filings from August, and the PAC claims on its website that it has raised nearly $2 million more since then.
The PAC, which Lessig created to curb the influence of money in politics, will distribute funds to candidates who support campaign finance reform efforts.
Little of that money, however, has come from Harvard affiliates. According to FEC filings, donors who reported themselves as employees of the University donated just over $5,000 to the PAC—a figure that excludes Lessig’s own contributions.
By contrast, former Law School professor and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren received substantial support from Harvard employees and affiliates. According to her campaign committee’s last filing in August, Warren received $312,550 from donors affiliated with Harvard since kicking off her campaign in 2011, according to Opensecrets, a campaign transparency database.
Lessig has long advocated for relaxed legal restrictions of copyrights and trademarks, but more recently shifted his focus toward the potential corrupting force of money in politics, which he views as a problem that must be solved before any other political challenges can be addressed.
Mayday has received contributions from over 60,000 donors. It relies on a match-contingent system: when a funding goal is reached, wealthy donors match the cumulative donations. For example, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, the co-founders of PayPal and LinkedIn respectively, have helped Lessig match the thousands of small donations that the PAC has collected.
Although it was born on Harvard’s campus, Mayday has generated most of its buzz and donations online, said Andrew Sellars, a fellow at the Law School’s Cyberlaw Clinic who contributed to the PAC.
“The conversation seems to be happening a lot in the internet policy space, where Lessig has been a prominent figure for so long,” Sellars said.
In total, the PAC aims to raise $12 million and support five candidates, with three additional candidates to be named in the coming weeks, according to the PAC’s website.
Yet Mayday’s ability to get its chosen candidates elected is still up for debate.
The PAC chose an underdog in the New Hampshire Republican primary, Jim Rubens, who lost to former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown in a lopsided race, despite the $1.6 million that the PAC funneled to his campaign. By contrast, Mayday picked up wins in smaller congressional primaries in Arizona and North Carolina.
For Kennedy School of Government professor Jane J. Mansbridge, who said she gave the PAC money “right out of her retirement account,” Lessig’s mission is incredibly important.
“My motivation [to give] is entirely a belief in the mission,” said Mansbridge, who knows Lessig only in a professional context. “I respect his intelligence greatly and his political savvy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following months of backlash against the announcement that the Q Guide will no longer display course difficulty scores for students, faculty members and undergraduates discussed reevaluating the decision and creating solutions to the problem on Wednesday at the first Committee for Undergraduate Education meeting of the semester.
The group discussed revisiting the decision to hide the difficulty score, changing the difficulty score from a quantitative metric to a more descriptive “narrative,” and publicly displaying grade distribution from previous offerings of a course. According to the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, discussion at the meeting indicated that the decision to change the difficulty display might be revisited by the Faculty Council, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences' governing body.
“The members of the Faculty Council present at the meeting seemed to agree that there was some sort of re-evaluation necessary of this decision,” said Goyal, who noted that he and members of the UC will be presenting a paper with recommendations for the Q score at the next CUE meeting.
The CUE—composed of administrators, members of the Faculty Council, and undergraduates, including UC representatives—is not a legislative body and does not vote on issues discussed. However, matters addressed may be amended at later Faculty Council meetings.
Stephanie H. Kenen, the administrative director of the Program in General Education, said that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris was in favor of adding a narrative element to the difficulty metric to better contextualize the ratings.
“A difficulty score may be more useful when a student knows something more about the background or the context of the student who is rating the course,” Kenen said. “It could be that we ask a narrative question: given your background...how difficult did you find this course?”
However, Kenen said she worried that a narrative explaining a student’s academic background and interests may prove too complicated to create a unified measure of difficulty.
“It’s not consistent in how students would report [the difficulty score without the numerical component] and how anybody would try to filter through that,” Kenen said.
Members of the committee also discussed allowing students to see grade distributions in each of their classes to help them better assess difficulty, though not everyone agreed on the matter.
“A good thing would be that students would know what the grade distribution is going into a course,” said UC representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16. “The bad thing is that students might see a grade that is otherwise not a bad grade—for example in a course that gives all A’s—and feel that a B or a B-plus is not a good grade, whereas in reality it is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is making visits to Harvard’s campus to investigate the College’s adherence to anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, according to two members of the student activist group that filed the complaint that precipitated the probe last spring.
Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17 and Jessica R. Fournier ’17, organizers for the student activist group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said they met with two OCR investigators responsible for the College investigation on campus on Sept. 10.
At that meeting, according to Fournier, the investigators—who she identified as Jane Lopez and Olga Benjamin—said they had spent the summer reviewing files from Harvard’s handling of past sexual assault cases and planned to begin reaching out to students for interviews as part of the investigation.
Fox-Penner and a second, unnamed undergraduate filed a complaint with the federal government on behalf of a larger group of students in March, alleging that the College’s sexual assault policies violated Title IX. OCR opened its investigation into the issue in April.
When reached by phone last week, Lopez declined to comment on the investigation, instead referring a reporter to Jim Bradshaw, a Department of Education spokesperson. Bradshaw did not respond to a request for comment this week, but in a separate statement in early September, he declined to comment on the status of the investigation at the College. That statement cited a May press release that said the Department of Education would not disclose any specific facts about OCR investigations until their resolution.
University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, who has not spoken with The Crimson on the record in 2014, did not respond to a request for comment on the investigation. University spokesperson Jeff Neal, meanwhile, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard expects OCR to “speak with various administrators” as part of its “usual process,” but citing confidentiality rules, did not comment further. In an interview last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said OCR had not contacted him about the investigation.
According to the Department of Education’s website, OCR’s investigatory process may include reviewing evidence submitted by the complainant and the school, conducting interviews with both parties, and making on-campus visits. If an OCR investigation determines that the school is not in compliance with federal regulations, OCR will attempt to enter a “voluntary resolution agreement” with the school to resolve the issues. If the school refuses to enter such an agreement, OCR will begin the process of withholding federal funds from the school.
Fox-Penner and Fournier said they provided Lopez and Benjamin with a list of suggested student organizations—BGLTQ-affiliated and cultural groups, among others—to interview. They said OCR will likely speak with other students as well.
OCR opened its investigation into the College’s Title IX compliance just days after University President Drew G. Faust said Harvard had submitted a revised sexual assault policy to OCR for review. Harvard implemented its revised policy—the University’s first that applies across all schools—this summer, before receiving official approval from OCR.
The federal government’s inquiry into the College’s Title IX compliance overlaps with efforts to get Harvard’s new policy up and running. The University is also currently under investigation for a separate Title IX complaint, which was filed against the Law School in 2010.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. "Hank" Paulson Jr. spoke at the Institute of Politics Wednesday evening, citing poor communication during the 2008 economic crisis as one of his failures during his tenure in Washington.
Paulson, who served under former President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009 and as the chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs from 1999 to 2006, also discussed topics such as U.S.-China relations and climate change policy at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
The discussion, which was moderated by Harvard Business Review editor-in-chief Adi Ignatius, focused on a reflection of Paulson’s actions as treasury secretary during the financial crisis.
“Most of the things that I look back on today were communications failures. It is very hard to communicate and to, on one hand, try and explain to people what is happening without scaring them or making it worse,” Paulson said. “When I left Washington, I saw one poll that had 90 percent of the people against the [Troubled Asset Relief Program], and I saw another poll and 60 percent of the people were against torture.”
Paulson also said that another failure was the lack of major reforms to government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Shane M. Sideris, an asset management analyst who attended the talk, agreed and said that this issue is the most relevant aspect of Paulson’s legacy.
“Six years later and [the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problem] is still not resolved,” Sideris said.
Paulson also emphasized the importance of strengthening the relationship between the U.S and China.
“This is by far the most important bilateral relationship we have,” said Paulson, who now serves as chairman of the Paulson Institute at the University of Chicago, a think tank that seeks to advance global environmental protection and sustainable economic growth in the United States and China.
Paulson said that in order to solve major economic, environmental, and climate problems on the global level, the U.S. has to compete and cooperate with China.
“We have to look at the areas where we have a strong mutual interest, a shared interest, and turn it into concrete actions. We have to build trust and not let the differences preclude our working together,” he said.
Former Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62, one of Paulson’s closest colleagues in Washington during the financial crisis, praised Paulson’s leadership abilities and his effectiveness during the crisis but said he was critical of Paulson’s stance and policies on China.
“I differ with [Paulson] some in that I think he is a little soft on the Chinese,” said Frank, who currently serves as an adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government. “He kind of excuses their anti-democratic practices more than I would like.”
A third part of Paulson’s speech dealt with climate change, which he said is the “worst imaginable problem” and one that can only be solved if both China and the U.S. work together.
Paulson said that the lack of willingness from businesses to treat climate change as an economic risk and the lack of pressure from the government to take action due to the long-term nature of the issue will lead to problems down the road.
“The only way you get change is if the people demand it,” Paulson said. “Young people are the hope.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 1, 2014, at 11:40 p.m.
Pan Shiyi and Zhang Xin, the couple who co-founded China’s largest commercial real estate company and donated $15 million to the University last July, shared their views on education and philanthropy with hundreds of students on Wednesday in a filled Science Center B.
The pair, which Forbes dubbed one of the “World’s Most Powerful Couples,” currently heads the real estate developer SOHO China Ltd. as well as the philanthropic organization SOHO China Foundation.
Last July, the foundation launched the $100 million “SOHO China Scholarship” to provide financial aid for Chinese students to study at the world’s top universities, starting with a $15 million gift to Harvard.
Co-hosted by Harvard China Fund and several Chinese students’ groups on campus, Wednesday's event was conducted mostly in Chinese because many audience members were Chinese nationals.
William C. Kirby, a professor of Chinese studies, introduced the couple by recounting their respective rags-to-riches stories.
Zhang worked as a factory girl before studying in the United Kingdom on financial aid. Similarly, the opportunity to go to college was life-changing for Pan, who was born in rural China.
“To both of them, education was key to later success. They know the transformative power of learning,” Kirby said, after calling their donation “a gift of transformational proportions.”
“I’ve always thought that one’s relationship with society is in an equilibrium. The more you give, the more you will gain,” Pan said in Chinese.
The couple, who has a combined 25 million fans on the Chinese Twitter-like social media platform Sina Weibo, faced severe criticism in China after announcing their donation to Harvard.
“People have been saying that we are taking money from the Chinese people before giving it away to Americans. Many have hurled us doubts and even invectives,” Pan said. “But we can’t live for these doubts. As long as we think it’s the right thing, we will keep doing it.”
Currently, eight Chinese students at Harvard College have benefitted from the SOHO China Scholarship.
“Eight scholars is a drop in the ocean,” Zhang said. “We can’t solve all the problems in China’s education system, but this serves as an example.”
Zhang said that even though China produced close to 10 million high school graduates last year, less than 500 applied to Harvard College.
“Many Chinese families are not aware of the financial options [offered by American colleges],” she said. “Through our public profile, we hope that more Chinese students will see this as a potential future.”
Some Chinese students have reacted positively to the scholarship.
“It’s going to have a lot of ripple effect[s]…. I would expect more and more donors coming from mainland China to replicate this,” said Sicong Shan, president of Harvard Chinese Students and Scholars Association and a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. HCSSA was one of four co-hosts of the event.
“This is a better way of using their money than if they go and purchase more real estate [properties],” said Yang Du, another GSAS student who attended the event.
Tianxing Lan ’18, one of the eight beneficiaries of the donation, said the total amount of financial aid that he was receiving from Harvard was not increased by the SOHO China Scholarship.
“I think for now, there hasn’t been a big influence on whether more Chinese students will apply to Harvard, because you can get financial aid anyway,” said Lan, referring to Harvard’s need-blind admissions and need-based financial aid policy for international students.
“But if they continue to give money to schools that don’t give a lot of financial aid to Chinese students such as Stanford and Duke, that would influence people’s decisions to apply to those schools,” Lan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around 25 Harvard affiliates braved steady rain on Wednesday to hand out yellow ribbons in a sign of support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong—a demonstration of solidarity replicated by students at more than 50 schools around the world.
The action was originally conceived by Heather L. Pickerell ’15 as a chance for those on Harvard’s campus to raise awareness about the protests, which have raised objections to the Chinese government's infringement on free speech and and free elections in Hong Kong.
But a Facebook event for the demonstration, created by Pickerell, quickly went viral, prompting the creation of parallel demonstrations, including at Yale, Brown, and the University of Toronto. In each, students were encouraged to wear yellow, a color traditionally associated with suffrage movements, on Oct. 1.
At Harvard, Pickerell, a Crimson editorial editor from Hong Kong, and other demonstrators held umbrellas and signs invoking the symbolism of the Hong Kong protests. After about two hours, the group marched from the Science Center Plaza to the John Harvard statue, where they took a group photograph.
In addition to showing solidarity with the Hong Kongese, Pickerell said she hoped the event would spark self-reflection among Harvard students.
“In countries like [the U.S.], it’s very easy to take for granted the ability to go to a voting booth. When you see someone get tear gas in the face, it should prompt you to think about how much you value your own political freedom,” Pickerell said, referring to the tear gas reportedly used by police against protesters.
“The tenacity of the Hong Kong demonstrators should prompt people to think about how much they would sacrifice for their own freedoms and rights,” Pickerell added.
Visiting Sociology fellow Tuen Yi “Jenny” Chiu said she participated in the action because she hoped the international support would protect students protesting in Hong Kong.
“Then it won’t turn into a tragedy like many years ago,” she said, referring to the Tiananmen Square student protests.
While some are calling Pickerell the “leader” of the international solidarity campaign, she said that the title isn’t an accurate description of her role.
“It has really been other students showing support and mobilizing students themselves on the Facebook page and spreading it across the country,” she said, adding that she was only responsible for the original Facebook event.
Jeffrey C. H. Ngo, a student at New York University and a student leader of the national organization U.S. Association for Democracy in Hong Kong, stressed the role of social media in bringing attention to events such as Pickerell’s.
Ngo also said that although demonstrations like the one at Harvard on Wednesday may individually seem small, collectively they amount to an international show of support for protesters.
“Any help is good help,” he said.
Though Harvard’s demonstration has gained support from many on and off-campus, it was not affiliated with any student organization.
The Harvard Hong Kong Society has released on its website a statement relating the facts of the protests and various activism opportunities for its members, but it has not chosen to take a political stance on the issue.
According to HHKS co-President Siyi “Ryan” Lee ’15, while the majority of the board of the Harvard Hong Kong Student Society supports Wednesday’s demonstration at Harvard as well as the views expressed by the Hong Kongese student protestors, the decision was made in order to respect the diverse views of the organization’s members and to preserve the educational and non-political mission of HHKS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students expressed confusion about the purpose and pedagogical goals of the Program in General Education at a town hall meeting Wednesday night, the first of four sessions scheduled for October intended to gauge student understanding of the program and pin down possible areas of improvement.
The meeting was hosted in Eliot House by the committee tasked with reviewing the Gen Ed program and producing a report assessing its current state. A dozen or so students and several teaching fellows were in attendance to reflect upon their experiences with the program, while several review committee members sat in to listen and ask questions.
Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly, who chairs the committee, said that the meeting confirmed what he had already begun to suspect based on anecdotal information collected last semester: that students do not understand the program’s scope and purpose.
“I think it’s interesting to hear students express confusion between General Education and distribution requirements,” said Kelly, who moderated the meeting. “It makes it hard to understand what to be aiming for.”
Students in attendance reflected this sentiment.
“Right now I think everyone thinks of [the general education program] as a distribution requirement,” said Adam O. Brodheim ’16. “So either rename it or fix it. I like the idea of fixing it.”
When the program was created in May 2007, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences legislated that it should aim to meet four main goals, including preparing students to act as citizens, to respond to change, to understand ethical consequences of their words and actions, and to teach students to “understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and values.”
Christina M. Teodorescu ’16 added that she thought the current iteration of the Gen Ed program is not well-articulated.
“I don’t feel like I have an understanding of what the philosophy is supposed to be,” Teodorescu said.
Other students said they thought that, often times, courses in the program have too much busywork or assignments that can undermine the academic integrity of the course’s material itself.
“I’ve been asked to do serious academic work at this institution,” said Sarah E. Coughlon ’15. “Make me do that.”
But when Kelly asked students whether or not they thought the program should be completely eliminated, they either said no or asked that it be revised, noting that the program has often led students to classes and fields they may otherwise never have considered.
After the meeting, Kelly said the session was “enormously helpful” for him and the committee, which will use the stories and experiences shared by students at the town hall meetings to inform a College-wide survey they will release this semester.
The committee will host three more town hall meetings this month.
Once students and faculty have been surveyed and the report completed, the committee will present findings and recommendations to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, who may then green-light the report to go public for discussion among the Faculty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s basketball team took the floor, it was to play in the third round of March Madness. On Oct. 17, the “madness” will move to Lavietes Pavilion, as the squad begins the 2014-2015 season with its fourth-annual “Crimson Madness” festivities.
The event will be modeled after the NBA’s All-Star Weekend, with a dunk contest and a three-point shootout leading up to the evening’s marquee event, the Crimson and Black inter-squad scrimmage. The entirety of the night will be broadcast live on ESPN3.
Last year, 1,785 fans packed the pavilion to see how returning stars like Brandyn Curry ’14 and Kyle Casey ’14 would mesh with the younger group that led the Crimson to its first-ever NCAA Tournament win in 2013.
This year, the question marks leading up to the season are quite different, as the graduation of Curry and Laurent Rivard ’14 means that Harvard has lost two of its best gunners from behind the arc. Many have thought that sophomore Corbin Miller—returning from a two-year mission—can fill in as the team’s go-to sharpshooter. But the night’s three-point competition will allow Crimson fans to witness the full arsenal of Harvard’s talent from deep, with Miller being joined by junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, freshman Andre Chatfield, and—not normally known for his play from behind the three-point line—co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi.
The dunk contest will feature a slate of familiar faces as well, as junior Agunwa Okolie will look to defend his 2013 title against frontcourt-mates sophomore Zena Edosomwan and senior Jonah Travis, along with wingman senior Wesley Saunders and rookie Chris Egi. Last year, Edosomwan got the crowd roaring by putting on a vintage Toronto Raptors Vince Carter jersey and imitating the NBA star’s famous arm-in-hoop slam (seen at 0:25 here). Okolie followed with an equally well-received pair of dunks, the first of which involved tossing the ball against the glass, jumping, catching, and throwing the rock home with two hands, all in one motion. The second slam was a 360 dunk, which he easily completed and which earned him his dunk contest title.
This year, the highflyers will have to impress two people well known in the Boston community—the Boston Celtics’ Jared Sullinger and Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy—who will judge the players’ dunk efforts.
The last time anyone saw the Harvard players in uniform, they were in Spokane, Wash., battling for a spot in the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16. In two weeks, they will be back in the familiar crimson and black jerseys, looking to bring some of last spring’s excitement to their very own version of “Madness.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s soccer team (6-3), last year’s Ivy League opener was rock bottom.
Having won just one of its first eight games in non-conference play, the Crimson preached "new start—new season." The team stressed urgency; then-co-captain Kevin Harrington ’14 said before the game that “it’s win or go home.”
Harvard started strong, taking a 67th minute lead on a sliding goal by A.J. Agha ’14. It was the team’s first goal in three games.
The blows from Yale came one after the other. The first was an 88th minute strike from Conner Lachenbruch—a scramble in front of the goal where an errant bounce left the Yale then-junior with a clear shot at the net.
Barely 90 seconds later came the decider—a free kick rocket that bounced off a Harvard defender and straight into the goal.
“When you put everything out on the line, sometimes you’re going to lose,” coach Pieter Lehrer said at the time, regarding the talk he had with his players. “As we keeping putting it out there, the results are going to change in our favor.”
Lehrer’s words proved prescient. The team ended the season on a 5-1 tear, finishing second in the Ivy League and beating the defending league champion, Cornell, on the road.
The defense, headed by the leadership of then-sophomore co-captain Mark Ashby, allowed just three goals in the subsequent four conference games.
One year later, Harvard appears to be hitting its stride. The team has scored 16 goals in five straight wins after netting a total of 20 in all of 2013.
The Crimson has battled back from 2-0 deficits in each of its last two games, both 3-2 wins over area rivals Northeastern and Massachusetts.
Suffice to say, the team is ready for the rematch in New Haven on Saturday.
“I’m really excited for the Ivies to start, just as everyone else is,” junior forward Andrew Chang said. “I’m ready to do what I can for the team.”
The team enters the game boasting an undefeated home record and a diverse group of weapons on the offensive end.
Ten different Crimson players have scored a goal this year, and 11 have recorded an assist.
The offensive success has led to increased confidence. Even after finding itself down two goals in the early moments of its last game, a 3-2 victory over Massachusetts where Harvard did not allow a shot against after the 18th minute, the team hardly blinked.
“After the second goal they scored, we gathered the team on the field and there was no doubt, no disappointment and lack of confidence,” Ashby said Sunday. “We had full confidence we were going to come back and win that game.”
The improved defense will be a key focus against a Yale squad that has struggled to score goals this year. The winless Bulldogs have found the back of the net only three times in eight games and just once in their last six.
After finishing last season by scoring six goals in its final three games, the Bulldogs have not yet scored twice in one game this year.
Led by Ashby, Lehrer has said he has full faith in this unit.
“They have done a great job all year,” Lehrer said. “Mark, for such a big guy, moves very well and is really an elite defender.”
Co-captain Kyle Henderson said that the team’s energy is completely focused on handling the Bulldogs this Saturday.
Henderson noted that the Crimson has viewed the season one game at a time, and that even its larger goals—as Chang noted Tuesday, the team’s ultimate goal is to win the national championship—cannot be achieved in any one game, but by taking each game in the schedule at a time.
“Our main goal right now is winning our next game against Yale,” Henderson said. “After that, our next goal will be to beat who we play next. We don’t set a big goal or anything other than winning our last game of the year. Hopefully, our last game of the year is the final game of the year for college soccer. But for now, [the focus] is just winning the next game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a brief mid-September slump, the women’s soccer team appears to have rediscovered its winning formula, stringing together three straight victories before a scoreless draw with crosstown rival University of Massachusetts on Monday night.
The contest marked the start of a four-game homestand for Harvard (6-2-1, 1-0-0 Ivy), which has played in Cambridge just three times this season.
On Saturday, the Crimson hosts Ivy League rival Yale (5-3-0, 0-1-0) at Soldiers Field. The Bulldogs dropped their league opener against Princeton, 1-0, on Saturday, while Harvard opened its Ivy League slate with a dominant 3-0 victory at Penn.
The win marked the ninth straight conference victory for the Crimson dating back to the 2012 season, as Harvard went undefeated in league play a year ago.
Yale, on the other hand, has struggled to stay competitive in the Ancient Eight in recent seasons, finishing fifth in the standings last year and sixth in 2012.
In fact, the Bulldogs have claimed the Ivy League regular season title just twice in the championship’s 32 -year history, while the Crimson has captured the crown four times in the last six seasons alone.
As the discrepancy in league titles implies, Harvard firmly controls the all-time series between the two programs.
The Crimson owns a 30-8-1 record against Yale, having beaten the Bulldogs six straight times, including a 3-1 victory in New Haven last year.
Yet despite the one-sidedness of the rivalry, Harvard does not intend to look past its Ivy rival.
“Every game in the Ivy League is so big,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “That’s just the nature of this league.... No one looks past any team.”
Indeed, the Ancient Eight schedule offers little room for error, as each team plays every other conference squad just once. As a result, a single loss can doom a team’s chances at claiming a championship.
This year’s edition of the rivalry pits two similar squads, as both have possession-based approaches and similar records heading into this Saturday’s tilt.
In addition, their goals-per-game averages and shot percentages are virtually identical.
The two teams have faced one mutual opponent thus far, with the Crimson besting the University of New Hampshire, 1-0, and Yale falling to the Wildcats by the same score.
In order to snap their losing streak against Harvard, the Bulldogs will have to find a weakness in a defense that has been nearly impenetrable recently.
The Crimson has recorded shutouts in six games so far this year, including four straight heading into Saturday’s contest.
“[They have] strong chemistry, they’re improving, they’re getting fitter,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “They’re covering each other well. I think that’s really the strength of it. And of course excellent goalkeeping from both [senior Cheta Emba] and [sophomore Lizzie Durack].”
Emba and Durack have split goalkeeping duties for the Crimson, as both have been equally solid between the pipes.
Thus far this season, the Crimson coaches have varied their approaches to get the two playing time, sometimes having the netminders split halves or playing alternate complete games.
Emba and Durack have impressive goals against averages of 0.57 and 0.48, respectively, with Emba making 17 total saves to Durack’s 10 stops.
As for the Harvard offense, it has had its share of ups and downs throughout the year. Despite scoring 2.5 goals per game in its six wins, the Crimson has been shut out in its other three contests.
Capitalizing on chances in the final third has been a point of emphasis for Harvard all season, and that focus remains the same heading into Saturday’s matchup.
The Crimson hopes to create a good deal of chances, as Yale has surrendered almost 14 shots per game this year.
“Early in the Ivy League...everybody’s in the race.” Leone said. “It’s exciting, it’s intense beyond belief, and those are challenges for your team to play under those high stakes…. You [have to] somehow be calm under pressure.”

The last time that the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-3, 0-1 Ivy) played Yale (5-5, 1-0), the match ended with tears of joy.
When fans rushed the court at Malkin Athletic Center last year in celebration of the Crimson’s first win over the Bulldogs since 2004, Harvard players and coaches struggled to compose themselves. Even coach Jennifer Weiss was spotted with tears in her eyes.
“Last season’s win against Yale was definitely a highlight of the season,” co-captain Caroline Walters said. “The on-court chemistry…made the match pretty unforgettable.”
The Crimson wouldn’t mind bringing tears of joy to Weiss’ eyes one more time this Friday night when the two teams meet in Cambridge for the first time since the upset.
“We were their only league loss last year, and I’m sure that bothers them,” co-captain Kristen Casey said.
But even with the recent success of the squad against its rivals from New Haven, the volleyball team is making a point of focusing on the past only as much as it affects the present.
“We have that strong rivalry with them,” Walters said. “And I think that the stakes will be even higher this year because we were the only [Ivy League] team to beat them last year.”
The home game against Yale will be Harvard’s second against an Ancient Eight opponent this season. After a hot start that included a five-game winning streak, the Crimson dropped its Ivy League opener to Dartmouth (10-2, 1-0) last weekend in Hanover, N.H.
“We learned some valuable lessons about mindset and preparation that I think were useful for us,” Casey said. “We can’t forget how long the season is.”
The Bulldogs also began Ivy League play last week, making a statement with a clean sweep of Brown (4-8, 0-1). Yale was able to maintain a .340 hitting percentage, well above its season average of .222.
This season, the Bulldogs are seeking their fifth consecutive Ivy League title. Harvard, which finished second in 2013, is aiming for its first championship since 2004 and second overall.
“We have been prepping in practice all week because they are very much a different team than we played last year,” Casey said.
Much of this difference is due to the graduation of Kendall Polan. A three-time Ivy League Player of the Year, Polan directed the Yale attack as a setter last year. Although freshman Kelsey Crawford has performed well in Polan’s absence, the departure of such a key member of the team has undoubtedly altered its identity.
Yale has been headlined so far this season by the duo of outside hitter Mollie Rogers, who leads the team with 116 kills, and setter Kelly Johnson, who is second with 94.
The Bulldogs are already a battle-tested bunch, having endured a rigorous nonconference schedule. Yale has played three teams ranked in the NCAA Top 25, including third-ranked Penn State. Meanwhile, Harvard has yet to play a ranked squad.
“Playing Yale is unlike any other game in the season,” Casey said. “They have been so dominant as long as I have been around, and the energy is just indescribable.”
In contrast to the two-pronged attack of the Bulldogs, the Crimson has relied on a team approach. Sophomore Corinne Bain, sophomore Grace Weghorst, junior Caroline Holte, and Walters have all racked up more than 80 kills.
Yale has dominated Ivy League play in recent years. Before last season’s loss to Harvard, the Bulldogs had compiled 25 consecutive wins against Ancient Eight opponents. Yale never dropped more than one set in a match during this period. In three consecutive contests before last year’s win, the Crimson lost in straight sets.
Even so, Harvard players remain optimistic about the team’s chances.
“We have a lot of confidence in our team and all the work we have done,” Casey said. “Winning the Ivy League championship is still very much the goal.”

Happy Thursday! Remember when you didn’t get a ticket to see Shonda Rhimes and Oprah on Tuesday while all your friends posted pictures of them on Facebook? And remember when the IOP emailed you saying that you unfortunately didn’t win the lottery to see Vice President Joe Biden speak tonight (PSA to those who won the lottery: thank you for making the rest of us feel like luck isn’t something we have or will ever have)? In light of this...
What would you do for a ticket to hear Vice President Joe Biden speak?1) Read all of Mankiw’s Ec10 textbook
2) Give up Brain Break for a year (but then again maybe not having 5 bowls of Apple Zings every night to drown your p-set sorrows away is really good for your personal health goals?)

In 2001, B.J. Novak told The Crimson he was going into the prank industry. His post-grad plan was to create large-scale hoaxes for businesses in order to increase their publicity and get them onto the nightly news. Read that last sentence again because it’s so weird.
Before tech existed, venture capital signed on to fund projects like this, we guess. “Funding [for] this peculiar business comes from the New Millenium Entertainment Fund, a venture capital start-up with $50 million in the bank,” The Crimson reported.
How did Novak describe it? "It's Survivor to the next level," he says. Sadly, Novak’s project didn’t live to see 52 seasons.
"It hasn't always been a dream of comedy, it's been a dream of making the biggest show I could. With that, I can affect what people talk about all day, what people dream about at night," continued Novak and/or God.
According to the article, Novak didn’t want “to create another show, package comedy and offer it to the public.” In 2004, he took a job writing for The Office.
Presently, Novak is writing half-assed books for children that don’t even have pictures in them. Support this floundering comedian, who no longer has his prank business, by seeing him at the Harvard Bookstore today.

Here’s what’s coming up, and why you should grab a group of friends and schedule a movie night!
20,000 Days on Earth
Described by the Brattle as a “lyrical ode to creativity,” the film delves into the mind of musician Nick Cave with a blended approach toward documentary and drama. Nick Cave’s success has been well-documented since he formed the rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds in 1983, and this feature seeks to provide a unique take on the creative process itself.
Showing: Thursday, Oct. 2 at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.

E-Team
Winner of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival Cinematography Award, Directors Ross Kauffman and Katy Chevigny tell the story of the Emergencies Team, or E-Team, the infantry of a human rights organization that uncovers details after a purported abuse occurs in the world community. Should the incident warrant further investigation, the team illuminates the realities of the atrocities and brings otherwise neglected first-hand accounts to life. The E-Team delves into the Syrian Civil War and Gaddafi’s tyrannical reign, while also getting a glimpse at what it takes to balance such mentally taxing work with a typical home life. Kauffman himself will be attending for a special Q&A moderated by the VES department’s own Robb Moss.
Showing: Monday, Oct. 6 at 7:30 p.m.

Vice President Joe Biden is visiting the Institute of Politics today. In honor of his presence on campus, we’re taking a look back to his studly college days. (Can someone say fifteen hottest freshmen?) His looks may have changed some over the years, but he was looking pretty fine when he was 26. For those of you lamenting the “nice” “fall weather,” not getting tickets to Oprah, and then not getting tickets to Biden, hopefully this picture of Biden’s formerly chiseled jaw is a source of strength.
Still procrastinating on your pset? Here are some facts about our Vice President you won’t be hearing at the Forum. Oh wait, you won’t be hearing anything at the Forum, because you can’t even get in.
