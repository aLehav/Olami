Are you in the mood to watch a film with so-so dialogue and TikTok-style transitions? Something with a few too many dramatic shots of dress trains and cloaks flowing in the wind, à la Severus Snape? Solid performances from two Emmas (Stone and Thompson) and some adorable pups that save the whole movie? Look no further than Disney’s “Cruella.”
“Cruella” offers a more sympathetic version of the Disney villain that haunted the dreams of every child who grew up watching “One Hundred and One Dalmatians.” She is first introduced as Estella (Emma Stone), a child born with naturally split-dyed hair that Gen Z would kill for. Cruella is the name given to her mischievous alter ego by her mother, who, in true Disney fashion, is killed off within the first 10 minutes of the film.
The first 45 minutes are underwhelming. Estella’s rise through the ranks of the fashion industry occurs at an unnecessarily slow pace, with a full ten minutes dedicated to her doing menial tasks at the Liberty department store. Her relationship with fashion designer Baroness Von Hellman (Emma Thompson) develops painfully slowly as well. The slapstick comedy — a garbage bag erupting over Estella’s head, or the Baroness’ goofy lawyer stumbling into the room with an exclamation of “Woah!” — feels out of place. It isn’t until the resurrection of Cruella that things start to get interesting — and dark.
A plot twist good enough to inspire an audible gasp reveals a dark secret about the Baroness, who Estella had come to admire. And so begins Estella’s descent into madness, stepping into the role of Cruella. Her journey of revenge comes with many hilarious scenes of sabotage, as she recruits the assistance of amateur thieves Jasper (Joel Fry) and Horace (Paul Walter Hauser), whom she’s lived with since her mother’s death. She also requires the help of their dogs, Buddy and Wink, whose acting is arguably just as good as any other human in the film.
Emma Thompson was built for the role of the Baroness. She is the embodiment of dignity, ordering around everyone she encounters with her posh and powerful English accent. Nobody else could deliver a line like “Get your dried-up, desiccated little brain working” with as much gusto as Thompson. She masters the look of indifference, striking fear into the hearts of others with nothing more than a single glance.
Emma Stone also plays Cruella brilliantly. Stone brings an undertone of innocence to the caricatured villain’s craziness. She is easy to root for, especially when the history of the Baroness becomes even more evil and more intertwined with Estella’s life. Some of Stone’s best scenes take place at the fountain where she goes to talk to her late mother. Before executing her final plan of revenge, Estella tells her mother, “But I do love you. Always.” with an expression so full of heartbreak that anyone who’s experienced grief can relate to it.
One must also acknowledge the astounding work done by “Cruella”’s hair and makeup and costume departments. The film’s exploration of Estella/Cruella’s dual personalities was made possible by the swift transitions between the red-haired, timid Estella and the split-dyed, bold Cruella. As she succumbs to insanity, her appearance becomes more disheveled. A film that revolves around the fashion industry also needs to showcase stunning designs, and this team certainly delivered. Gala scenes are a feast for the eyes, with a bounty of color and innovation. Adorned in jaw-dropping looks, Cruella and the Baroness are two of the most stylish villains in cinematic history.
Despite a rocky start, the latter half of “Cruella” is definitely more exciting . The theme of chosen family tugs at our heartstrings, strong female friendships bring about change, and the prioritization of mental health allows Cruella to leave her state of madness behind. The off-putting beginning and the gratifying end yield a film that’s just okay, but still worth watching for the infallible acting of Thompson and Stone.

On Sep. 3, the line to get into the Hostetter Gallery to see the new “Titian: Women, Myth, & Power” exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum spanned the entire length of the hallway. The wait, however, was undoubtedly worth it.
The exhibition, which opened on Aug. 12, features a series of works that Titian, the famed painter of the Venetian Renaissance, created for King Philip II of Spain between 1551 and 1562. The stars of the show are the six poesie, which depict scenes from classical antiquity that grapple with gender, power, and sexual violence. This the first time in over four centuries that these six paintings have been reunited in one room, a task that involved the cooperation of museums and galleries around the world.
“What I wanted to do with this installation was to try to recreate the experience that Philip would have had in being surrounded by these six canvases that Titian meant to be seen together,” said Nathaniel E. Silver, the Gardner Museum’s William and Lia Poorvu Curator of the Collection. “While we couldn't replicate or imitate the architectural experience of that room, we could recreate the immersive experience of surrounding yourself with these canvases.”
One canvas is receiving more attention than the others. “The Rape of Europa,” purchased by Isabella Stewart Gardner herself in 1896, has always been a beloved part of the museum’s collection. But for the first time, the painting was comprehensively cleaned in preparation for this exhibition. Now, viewers can experience the true, restored vibrance of Titian’s colors and composition.
“It’s one of the most important Renaissance paintings in the United States,” Silver said. When asked if he had a favorite of the poesie, he fondly replied, “Oh, it's definitely our 'Europa' for several reasons… It’s in the best condition of any of the paintings, and it really was for us the jumping off point for this exhibition.”
Silver also noted how “Europa” embodies the issues that are central to the exhibition.
“That painting alone raises the questions of gender, power, and sexual violence that we felt were extremely relevant to address today, and that we hoped to encourage viewers to contemplate,” he said.
The presence of these themes in Titian’s 16th century paintings is a striking reminder that many of the social issues we navigate today have deep roots in our history.
The recent passing of the Texas anti-abortion law, Senate Bill 8, and the consequent rise in conversations about women’s rights to their own bodies brings an added significance to the paintings in the exhibition that portray the consequences of sexual violence. For instance, the painting “Diana and Callisto” shows the moment in which the nymph Callisto is discovered to be pregnant after having been raped by Jupiter. Rather than offer support, Diana and the other nymphs shame her, tearing off her clothes and blaming her for the destruction of her honor.
The serious and sensitive subjects of Titian’s paintings provoked deep contemplation among viewers.
“Well, it’s powerful to see amazing art,” Marie Enochty, a visitor, said. “But the subject matter leaves a bit of a question in my mind, because of the myths of rape. Women are portrayed in a way that's different than what one would think about in this time and age.”
“There’s that very thin line between romance and rape and beauty and destruction,” Laurie O. Curtis, another visitor to the exhibition, said. “I mean, it’s very complex, it’s hard to look at some of them.”
Visitors also expressed an appreciation for the wall labels that accompanied each piece and aided in their comprehension of Titian’s work. “They did such a good job of condensing the amount of words that they could only fit on this little tiny paper to get you to think about the story and draw you into the painting,” Curtis said. “That was really well done.”
One label offered an explanation of the painting’s historical context, while another provided a personal “Reconsidering Titian Today” response from various artists, scholars, and community members. These insights helped tie themes from the 16th century to the 21st, offering unique and enriching perspectives as well as making the interpretation of art accessible to visitors from all walks of life.
In addition to the six poesie, the gallery includes portraits of Philip and his wife Queen Mary Tudor, documentation of “The Rape of Europa’s” restoration, letters discussing Gardner’s purchase of “Europa," and artworks inspired by “Europa.” The museum also commissioned two new interdisciplinary responses to Titian’s work by contemporary artists: a short film called “The Rape of Europa," created by Mary Reid Kelley and Patrick Kelley, and a powerful image on the museum’s street facing Anne H. Fitzpatrick Façade called “Body Language” by Barbara Kruger.
“You know, a lot of artists in history have celebrated Titian as a great painter,” Silver said. “But this particular group of paintings are central to the experience and the formation of some of the most important painters in Western European art history.”
The exhibition is open until Jan. 2, 2022.

“You Belong Here Now,” Dianna Rostad’s debut novel, tells the story of three orphans from New York who are welcomed into a cattle-farming family in Montana. Released in early April, the book is a casual read that should appeal to a wide audience, though pickier readers might find the novel slightly less attractive for its lack of detail and sophistication.
As its title might suggest, “You Belong Here Now” is a book primarily about family and belonging. Set in 1925, the story alternates between narration from the perspectives of Charles — the oldest of the three orphans with a dark and obscure background — and Nara — the youngest daughter in the Stewart family. The book begins as Charles, Patrick, and Opal flee from the “orphan train,” a trip to help find homes for orphans out west, for fear of being sent home to the New York hell they have just escaped. When Charles tries to steal a horse to help the group along on its journey, he is caught by Nara, whose family decides to let the three children work at the ranch as punishment. As one might expect, the orphans’ stay on the Stewart ranch lasts longer than planned, and they are slowly welcomed into the family.
When reading this novel, it is clear that Dianna Rostad has made a concerted effort to make her story accessible to a wide audience. Her novel is made easy to read by her simple and direct language, and its underlying themes are not difficult to pick out. Rostad steers clear of any plot elements that might be too suggestive or traumatizing for a young audience and limits herself to only a handful of expletives — which, frankly, the book could even do without.
But perhaps what broadens the appeal of “You Belong Here Now” is its cast of characters, which includes kids, teens, adults, and even seniors. All of these characters struggle with their own unique conflicts as the plot moves forward, giving readers of all ages a figure with whom to identify and from whom to learn.
Unfortunately, this bounty of characters also reveals one of the novel’s biggest weaknesses. Indeed, the characters and conflicts that Rostad introduces into her book are so numerous that they can be hard to follow. With so many characters, she is simply unable to dedicate the time to develop each to its fullest. The book’s character development lacks nuance, and any growth or change seems almost forced. Even Nora and Charles feel underdeveloped at the end of the novel. As a result, “You Belong Here Now” finds itself missing the element of verisimilitude that would make its story that much more moving.
The characters, however, are not alone in lacking detail. The setting of the novel also feels rather undeveloped, and the book goes far too long without giving the reader any clear indication that its action takes place almost a hundred years ago. There is also significant sensory detail missing from descriptions of the Stewarts’ farm and the surrounding Montana landscape. This is a shame, as Rostad’s choice to favor simplicity has left the novel without the descriptions of the breathtaking Montana mountains, fields, and farms that would really transport the reader into this story.
The plot, too, suffers from a lack of refinement. Though at times it can be touching or suspenseful, the plot’s shifts feel abrupt, jumping and skipping between the uncountable conflicts Rostad has tasked herself with managing. Some plot elements, such as Charles’ inability to control his temper and violence, feel belabored, and the timeline also feels unrealistic: It is truly hard to believe that Charles would become a near expert rancher after living with the Stewarts for less than a year.
In the end, “You Belong Here Now” is a novel that suffers from a paradox of complexity: at times too simple, and at others too complicated. Its plot, characters, and setting feel underdeveloped, but mostly as a result of Rostad’s attempt to cram too much into what would have been better left as a simpler story. On the other hand, her language is easy to read, and all the many characters offer each reader, no matter their age, someone to relate to.
The bottom line: If one can overlook Rostad’s problem with detail, then “You Belong Here Now” is indeed a novel worth reading.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sep. 3, British girl band Little Mix released “Love (Sweet Love),” a fun and stylish tune to fit the end of the summer.
One of the group’s first singles since member Jesy Nelson stepped down in December 2020, “Love (Sweet Love)” signals the remaining members’ decision to keep to the styles they’re known for while remaining as vocally and technically strong as ever. The bouncy and creative sonics form a pretty and quintessentially pop song. However, the subject matter — loving yourself — recalls the odes to self-love that were popular circa 2015 (Justin Bieber’s “Love Yourself” and Hailee Steinfeld’s “Love Myself,” to name a few).
The single begins with a quick, staccato verse from Leigh-Anne Pinnock, followed by a bright, staccato pre-chorus from Jade Thirlwall, to create an energetic tone. The members divide the singing fairly evenly, with Perrie Edwards shining in the bridge. Overall, their voices merge seamlessly, with harmonies that are elevated by ad libs. Thirlwall’s riffs are particularly impressive, lending the tune a polished feel.
The title of “Love (Sweet Love)” is grammatically weird, either suggesting “Sweet Love” as an alternate title — which seems reductive — or treating the repetition of “Sweet Love” as an echo or backing vocal after “Love” — which does not fit the structure of the song. Regardless, the title sufficiently fits the main theme of self-love. While this song isn’t the most sophisticated lyrically, with only two verses, it is a catchy pop anthem and definitely works for what it is. It was also co-written by Jade Thirlwall and Leigh-Anne Pinnock, showing how involved the band continues to be in their music. This is also a great move individually, as Thirlwall and Pinnock were finally officially recognised as songwriters in 2019 after they had already contributed to many of their previous hits.
This is the first single from their upcoming album “Between Us,” celebrating ten years of Little Mix after the group’s formation and victory on “The X Factor” in 2011. As such, the album will repackage some of their greatest hits while also including five new tracks. Even though it is certainly a cop-out to charge the price of a new album for what is categorically not a completely new album, it allows them both to pay tribute to Little Mix’s evolution over their six albums and also showcase the group as it stands now. Nelson’s great contribution to the team over the years is recognized along with the continued work of the three remaining members. “Love (Sweet Love)” is definitely an interesting choice for the lead single — while the themes of romance, self-worth and self-love are definitely on brand, the composition suggests they are moving in a new direction from the days of their most successful album “Glory Days,” or even their latest album “Confetti.” Ultimately, this is an exciting direction, and it’ll be interesting to see where they go next.

In an interview with Princeton University, acclaimed novelist Chang-rae Lee once described his wordsmithing as a sort of “pathology.” “I like to put a lot of pressure and attention on every sentence, and I really can’t move on until I’m satisfied by the previous sentence,” he said. In fact, it’s not uncommon for Lee to revise a single line 10 or 20 times before training his focus on the next.
This strategy seems rather excessive until one becomes acquainted with the exacting style of Lee’s prose. His writing is marked by a hallmark descriptive richness — and extremely long sentences. A sentence on the first page of his novel “The Surrendered,” the Pulitzer Prize finalist on the intersecting paths of three lives shaped by the devastation of the Korean War, numbers nearly 70 words. His newest foray into fiction, “My Year Abroad,” is no exception. Totalling 61 words, the book’s opening sentence snakes well into the first page.
On the surface, “My Year Abroad” delivers exactly what its title promises: an account of somebody’s year abroad. However, it quickly becomes clear that Lee’s story is as much about the mental and emotional complexities of being unmoored as it is about a physical state of travel. At its best, the novel is an artful reminder that wanderlust is often just a masked desire to return home. Lee chooses to magnify his characters’ anxieties, underscoring their shared unease at the prospect of being left behind. But as the story suggests time and again, it’s precisely these characters’ deficiencies — and their ensuing efforts to evolve, to find wholeness — that make them so capable of love.
The novel follows ex-college student Tiller Bardmon who, disenchanted by his prestigious college in the fictive town of Dunbar, New Jersey, resolves to venture into the broader world. (One notes that this unnamed institution is strikingly similar to an actual liberal arts college esteemed for its manicured lawns and swanky eating clubs)
Alternating between the past and the present, the story introduces a host of central characters including Val, Tiller’s older beau; Victor Jr., her brilliant yet sociopathic son; and Pong, a mysterious Chinese businessman who convinces Tiller to partake in his ventures. Each stirs something deep within Tiller — his vulnerability, his loneliness, his complicated animosity and his search for love. However, they also remain inaccessible, full of secrets and concealed past traumas. It’s this fraught tension between intimacy and distance that shapes the relationships of Lee’s protagonist.
The winding prose of “Abroad” is undoubtedly challenging, at times even frustrating. Occasionally, it borders on the downright confused. The redeeming quality of Lee’s labored narration is the way it reflects the restlessness and caprice of Tiller’s own psyche. In many ways, Tiller reads like a cosmopolitan Holden Caulfield. Like Salinger, Lee fixates on the adolescent’s capacity for both wonder and disillusionment, for a love of the world and a simultaneous revulsion toward its brutality and injustice. At one point, Tiller reflects on his complicated love for both Val and his broader surroundings. “I do love her and that’s that but sometimes I think I love the world more,” he muses. “Am I totally messed up? If you’re willing to die for too many things, does it mean you care too much or too little? Does it mean you’ll break down very soon?”
But where some of Lee’s stylistic choices succeed, others fail. By interweaving the past and the present, Lee endeavors to arrive at a sort of retrospective lucidity. Sometimes, it works. Withholding details about Tiller’s past creates a productive tension; Lee flashes glimpses of — but initially doesn’t reveal in full — the nature of his protagonist’s formative escapades. On other occasions, the continual mention of a past Tiller promises he’ll “eventually describe” feels like a poorly masked attempt at incentivizing readers to just keep reading.
The most interesting feature of Lee’s newest novel is the versatile function of its titular concept: being “abroad.” The layered significance of this term serves as the novel’s central revelation. In the most literal sense, Tiller goes abroad by leaving Dunbar. But more abstractly, he’s been abroad his entire life. Ethnically, Tiller feels disconnected. He self-identifies as a misfit “near whiteness,” even using the phrase “semidiasporic postcolonial indeterminate” to describe his mixed heritage. The same can be said about his social situation; when enrolled in college, the Dunbarite attends expensive ski trips with acquaintances and bears witness, half amused and half disgusted, to their blithe excess. Even in his most familiar spaces — even within his own body, his heritage — it’s possible that Tiller has always been abroad, peering into his own life from the outside.
Tiller’s experience of being adrift in both body and spirit speaks directly to the novel’s underlying vision. Because for Lee, “abroad” never functioned simply as a description of physical departure. Rather, it served as an encompassing sensibility — not just a way of describing the world, but also of existing in it.

Vendela Vida’s latest novel “We Run the Tides” follows Eulabee, an eighth-grader attending a private all-girls school in San Francisco, whose friendships and life get turned upside down after her friends, Julia and Maria Fabiola, report having been flashed while the three of them were walking to school — an event that Eulabee claims never happened. Exiled from her friend group, Eulabee begins the entrance into young adulthood by herself, without anyone to support or guide her. When Maria Fabiola goes missing shortly after these events, Eulabee finds herself unsure of who, if anyone, to trust.
“We Run The Tides” is, at its core, a coming-of-age story, and in many ways stays true to the genre. There’s the first crush, the cliques, the anxiety over bras, and even — in a moment reminiscent of books like “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” — the first period in all its horribleness. “I was betrayed by my femininity,” Eulabee remarks, after the fact.
The story does not treat “coming-of-age” simply as an awkward journey, nor as an experience of gaining selfhood as many other novels do. Rather, the book views this process as a perilous one, portraying the growth into womanhood and adulthood as entering a dangerous new world full of sexual misconduct, kidnappings, and the real possibility of death.
What makes “We Run the Tides” successful, however, is that it doesn’t just focus on how dangerous life is for the girls, but instead shows how the existence of these dangers, even on the outskirts of their lives, shapes their everyday relationships. Throughout the book, Eulabee is harassed, humiliated, and worse by men. Without friends or support, Eulabee finds herself almost dependent on these interactions, even in their painfulness. “I want the connection again,” Eulabee narrates during a particularly gut-wrenching scene where a boy humiliates her. The book thus delivers a striking depiction of the way that sexual misconduct can be not only destructive but confusing for young girls, and how the loneliness of pubescence is made only worse as much of the attention and connection that these girls are receiving is inappropriate.
Complicating this narrative is the way “We Run The Tides” focuses on the lies told by Eulabee and her friends, especially the more despicable lies. At the end of the book, which takes place when the girls are in their 50s, and Eulabee reveals that a particular lie about sexual harassment told by her and Maria Fabiola has stayed with her for much longer than any of the actual sexual harassment the girls faced. These lies come to take center stage, thus placing the reader in the same state of confusion faced by its main characters.
Eulabee’s disconnected narrative voice adds to this sense of confusion. The story is told in the present tense, but there is almost a nostalgia to the way Eulabee talks about the events of the book, focusing more on setting and place than the feelings of the characters involved.
The downside of this distanced tone is that many of the characters, outside of Eulabee and Maria Fabiola, seem underdeveloped, as Eulabee fails to describe much more than their appearance. Furthermore, the story’s focus on the possibility of danger (rather than danger itself) sometimes results in a loss of momentum.
In the saturated field of coming-of-age novels, “We Run The Tides” successfully brings a new voice to the genre focusing on the dangers facing young women in a way that seeks to understand and empathize with them, rather than just position them as victims.

Anyone not living under a rock has most likely seen Drake beefing with Kanye West. The duo has been on unfriendly terms for a while, but with both rappers dropping albums in the past week, this longtime feud is getting personal. From subtle digs to a full blown Twitter war, both players have stepped up to ruin each other’s reputations.
The conflict began as early as 2010, when Drake’s sample verse was cut from the final version of West’s “All of the Lights.” The Canadian rapper brushed it off at first, swearing up and down that he was “completely OK” being slighted by West’s creative eccentricity. But then, as early as 2011, Drake was the one throwing some shade on Jay-Z and Kanye’s “Watch The Throne,” rapping in his verse on DJ Khaled's "I'm On One”: "I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking / Watch me take it."
The not-so-friendly competition carried on until 2018, when things went down between Drake and Pusha T. The two were already established enemies by that point, and West proceeded to stir the pot by producing Pusha T’s diss track “Infrared.” The record made digs at accusations that Drake uses ghostwriters, such as “The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin.’” That hit a sore spot with Drake, who pointed out that it was hypocritical for West to help spread these allegations when he himself had previously recruited Drake as a ghostwriter.
Fast forward to 2021, and unprecedented has become the new normal for Yeezus scandals. Whether it be in regards to Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, or DaBaby, West hasn’t exactly made the most popular decisions. More recently, he recorded a track for his latest album “Donda” called “Life of the Party,” which made a dig at everyone under the sun, including Virgil Abloh, Kid Cudi, and Drake himself. Although this song did not make the final version of the album, it did make Drake’s next Sirius XM interview on Sep. 3 a lot more interesting.
That was when Drake went on air to release yet another controversial diss track to the world.
On the surface, this looks like just another move by Drake to get back at West. Still, Drake leaking this particularly petty Kanye diss track seems like a deliberate ploy to rope West into a whole lot of trouble with anyone who dares collaborate with him next. Take Andre 3000, who was featured on “Life of the Party” and is desperately trying to avoid the backlash by insisting that he still just wants “to work with people that inspire [him]” rather than be enemies by association. Some might say Drake is only repaying the favor for the way West’s “Infrared” baited Drake into the beef that ultimately led to Pusha T dropping the bomb that he has a son.
But that isn’t the only feud to come out of “Donda.” Fellow rappers Soulja Boy, and Chris Brown were also slighted by West when he cut them from the star-studded album. Indeed, according to numerous screenshots and live stories, West was apparently busy going around asking for feature verses only to leave them out from the final record.
It’s becoming clear that West has accumulated more foes than friends on his quest for collaborations.

“In the Lateness of the World” is poet and translator Carolyn Forché’s first new collection of poems in 17 years. Released in March 2021, the collection contains poems that originally appeared in publications such as the “Boston Review,” “The Nation,” and “The New Yorker,” rather aptly indicating the quality of writing that can be found between its covers.
While they don’t tell a single story, the individual poems that make up “In the Lateness of the World” take the reader on a meditative journey of thought and reflection, presumably the same journey on which Forché embarked in order to better understand the balance between life and death. As one would expect, spirituality plays a large role in this collection, though with pointed allusions to aspects of all the major faiths, Forché’s work is tastefully universal. Spirituality is not, however, the only theme battling for the reader’s attention, being joined also by the tides of history.
The journey on which Forché takes her readers within “In the Lateness of the World” is as much a trip through the human past as it is a spiritual soul-searching. Throughout the collection, the reader is transported to different places across the world and different epochs across time as Forché relives the past, both the world’s and her own. Her work is filled with artful descriptions of fields covered with snow and cliffsides battered by the sea, but the real magic is in the details, in the images of a cinched and broken-locked suitcase or the dust raised by the wings of a kaleidoscope of butterflies.
These details are what give substance to the transient moments and stories that Forché relives in this collection, the ones that truly make the collection worth reading. This imagery is the heart and soul of the collection, allowing her to bring to life the scenes from her memory and fill the blank canvas of the imagination with the lifeforce of the departed.
The poems in this new collection come in groups, dedicated to the exploration of the same themes, the same physical places, and what one can assume to be Forché’s memories of the same person. In fact, many of Forché’s poems carry dedications, which in part explains her habit of directly addressing the reader. Perhaps more importantly, however, this level of intimacy with the reader has the effect of making them a protagonist in each of Forché’s memories; as a result, each poem comes off as even more vivid and, as is the mood of the collection as a whole, more poignant.
Overall, Forché’s poems strike a solid middleground between being too simple and too complex. They are properly nuanced but not unreadable, with enough complexity to keep readers interested and entertained but not so much as to make them frustrated. Allusions abound — mainly religious and to other works of poetry — oftentimes leading the reader down new and digressing avenues of exploration, all without obfuscating the core message of any single poem. Forché’s language itself is tasteful, soft, and quiet, and it is clear that much thought has gone into this choice in diction, which is instrumental in perpetuating the trancelike feel that the collection takes on.
In the end, “In the Lateness of the World” is as much the thoughtful, poignant, and artful collection of poems that it is advertised to be. Forché’s work in this collection is profound, taking the reader on a vivid journey of reflection that explores the intersection of history, spirituality and memory. It would seem that her 17 year hiatus was indeed worth the wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sep. 3, 2021, Champagne Papi (Drake) released his long-awaited sixth studio album “Certified Lover Boy,” which he has been working on since 2019. According to Drake, the record is a sort of tongue-in-cheek inversion of his polarizing reputation as a “certified lover boy,” intended to flip the narrative to get back at the haters. It does just the opposite; however, actually reinforcing Drake’s self-professed “toxic masculinity” in a way that detrimentally holds him back from growth.
Like many songs on the album, the intro track, “Champagne Poetry,” is made up of two parts. Part one features “the effortless flows,” in Drake’s words, that never fail to bring success to his record label OVO. The beat fades out just before the second part, when the sonics accommodate the transition from repetitive verses into a more dynamic beat. The lyrics guide the thematic transition from circular “talk about how [Drake] got a fortune on [him]” to the more ambitious and therefore interesting topics like “this the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore.” Similarly complex is the Travis Scott track “Fair Trade,” where Drake is “losin' friends and findin' peace” while Scott follows through with lines like “bury them / I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons.” The beat resonates — a synergy of the harmonic sample perfectly complementing Scott’s signature reworked hi-hats — perfectly unifying the rappers’ matching flows. “Get Along Better” is also a melodic marvel, with emotionally sung lyrics that highlight the struggle of heartbreak in a way the audience can sympathize with. The production on these tracks is innovative and exciting, matching the lyricism and giving the listener a glimpse of a new side to Drake.
The album as a whole; however, does little by way of self-exploration.
“No Friends In The Industry” and “7am On Bridle Path” are direct attacks at Drake’s enemies — namely Kanye West — that have all the pompousness and arrogance a diss track demands. The vocal inflections and undertones to Drizzy’s flow serve to highlight the animosity when contrasted with the heavy hitting beat, but do not cohere with the album’s goal of self-growth.
“Papi’s Home” follows through on phenomenal beats but falls short lyrically. With simple rhyme schemes and even simpler verse progressions, not even the Nicki verse can save it from failure. Even less impressive is the track “Girls Want Girls,” a song that compares Drake and Lil Baby to lesbians while also blatantly fetishizing lesbian relationships. “Say that you a lesbian, girl, me too,” is giving 2009 Drake, when he rapped about “are any of y'all into girls like I am? Les-be-honest!” on “Every Girl.” Toxic masculinity, two-timing, and stereotypical playboy vibes are all there to fit in with the title, but clearly, he hasn’t grown much in terms of emotional maturity.
“Knife Talk'' belongs to a category of songs on this album where the feature dominates the track. Although the sampled vocals from Project Pat and violin melodies are new and refreshing, the track is most distinctly reminiscent of 21 Savage’s projects like “Savage Mode.” Similarly, the funky afro-beats on “Fountains” have Tems written all over them, outshining Drake’s measly verse or two. In fact, one of the most consistent trends on this record is that the features carry the album, leaving Drake in the dust. “You Only Live Twice” belongs to Rick Ross and Lil Wayne, and “IMY2” is Kid Cudi’s song. “Love All” is riddled with heavy 808’s and jazzy keyboard riffs, setting a blue mood for Jay Z as he raps about “only thing we 'spect now is violence,” and overpowers the track. Although these collaborations are bangers, they unfortunately make Drake out to sound like a feature on his own album.
Then come an excessive amount of forgettable tracks one after another. “TSU” sees Drake praising a stripper for her work ethic in a narrative that falls flat both emotionally and melodically. Similarly, “Pipe Down” beats the overused theme of Drake’s failed relationship woes into the ground. The passive-aggressive verses fail to evoke sympathy, since he himself reinforces that he goes through relationships faster than he can mourn them. “Yebba’s Heartbreak” serves as a romantic interlude from mediocre to subpar with no contribution on Drake’s part. “Race My Mind” has an interesting snippet of harp-like trills, but is otherwise unremarkable in terms of flow and thematic continuity. Likewise, when Drake falls “N 2 Deep” with the club scene and Future hikes along for the ride, there is no verse significant enough to commit the song to memory.
“Way 2 Sexy” features Future and Young Thug, where the rapper’s individual styles shine, but the repetitive intro sample dominates the melody, holding the song back from ever reaching its potential. It happens yet again on the track “In The Bible,” where Lil Durk’s self-confidence shines in his flow, contrasting with Giveon’s emotional vulnerability in “when you see the real, will you still want me?” Despite the deep bass and blasphemously sexy electric guitar riffs, the song’s mixed perspectives are starkly different from each other and Drake’s own, which focuses on the party lifestyle. Evidently, there remains an inherent disconnect between the union of the thematic melody and the dissonance of the lyrics.
There’s nothing more disappointing than a bloated, generic, and recycled album. Where’s the chameleon Drake that dared to experiment? Where’s the ambitious rookie that took risks? The elusive persona that was promised to be unveiled in this album? Instead of following through on the promise of evolution, he made the album where all Drake songs go to die.

In “The D’Amelio Show,” Hulu’s new reality TV show about a family of TikTok stars, Charli and Dixie D’Amelio seem haunted. Most of the events of the show are pretty normal, if not mundane — the sisters hang out with family and friends, go on dates, and scroll through their phones. Over these scenes, however, the producers have superimposed screen grabs of comments from the D’Amelios’ social media accounts. Some of the comments are supportive — adoring fans expressing their support of the girls’ careers — but most of them are negative. Over and over again we see the girls bombarded with hate, and we see it get to them. The cameras roll as Dixie sobs over a negative reaction to a Vogue video, and as Charli has a panic attack when she is confronted with a paparazzi. The sisters tell the camera that their fame makes them too scared to leave the house. It is hard to watch.
“The D’Amelio Show,” itself, however, is framed as a solution to this hate. “I’m proud of myself that I shared this much,” Charli D’Amelio says in the final episode while reflecting on the show. She goes on to implore her fans to be nicer: “If you spread positivity, I think social media can be a different place.” The goal of “The D’Amelio Show” is clear — by showing the D’Amelios being vulnerable with their audience, it’ll make the sisters’ fans more empathetic. It’s a nice idea, but one that completely misunderstands the nature of the modern celebrity-fan relationship, and through this misunderstanding, “The D’Amelio Show” ends up feeding the very same monster it claims to be fighting against.
The online hate comments that “The D’Amelio Show” quotes from are varied — drawn from Youtube and TikTok videos, criticizing everything from the girls’ voices to their appearances. After watching a couple of episodes of the show, however, a clear theme develops — hundreds of nameless, faceless fans are demanding to know why and how the D’amelios are famous.
It’s interesting that, as the producers of the show chose to highlight these comments, no one really ever answers this question. “First of all, I don’t consider myself famous,” Charli says in one testimonial, before going on to stress that her fame was an accident.
But with over 100 million Tiktok followers and counting, it is hard to see how Charli could be considered anything other than a celebrity. Charli’s comment, however, isn’t entirely unfounded. There is a distinction to be made between the type of fame Charli holds and a more traditional type of fame in a pre-internet world. The difference lies in the “accidental” nature of the D’Amelios’ fame. It’s not very easy to “accidentally” become an actor, or a singer, or any of the other traditional paths to stardom, which require a certain level of talent or influence to achieve. But in a world where everyone posts on social media, and where any post can be picked up by the algorithm and shared to hundreds if not thousands of strangers, “fame” is no longer inaccessible. Fame, it seems, is now available to anyone with an iPhone. In a 2016 episode of Peter Holmes’ podcast “You Made it Weird,” comedian Bo Burnham expands on this point: “At some point, there were famous people and normal people and then the floor fell out and now there is a continuum that starts with one like and ends with Kim Kardashian and there is a ladder that everyone is on.” If anyone could have fame, why doesn’t everyone have it?
And of course, celebrity doesn’t just mean the attention of millions. For as much time as “The D’Amelio Show” spends delving into the personal lives of its subjects, it spends double that showing off their wealth. There’s the LA house with the floor-to-ceiling windows and the infinity pool. There’s the personal hibachi chef and fancy meals at rooftop restaurants. There are the shopping trips and the matching athletic sets. As it often does, their fame means wealth.
With all this in mind, the hate comments that the D’Amelios receive don’t seem so much like personal attacks as they do cries of envy. “Why are the D’Amelios famous?” starts to sound a lot more like “Why them and not me?” The same year Charli D’Amelio hit 100 million followers, unemployment in the US reached a 70-year peak. It is no wonder people think something about the D’Amelios’ rise to prominence is unfair.
But the sense that the average person is only “an accident” away from D’Amelio-esque fame does not just lead to feelings of envy. It leads to entitlement. In this new age of celebrity, if the average person can’t be the famous person they envy after, they can have almost unlimited access to them. The D’Amelios don’t just produce dancing videos on TikTok. They livestream. They vlog. Comments, hateful or not, are just another form of this access — a direct line to celebrity. Hate comments demand attention; they demand control over their target.
At a certain point, it does not matter how charming or likable the sisters are. The D’Amelios’ attempts at quelling hate by providing more access, by showing the sisters at their worst, is thus only stoking the fire. Showing Dixie and Charli mid-panic attack is not embracing vulnerability, it’s exploiting their accessibility, and in this way “The D’Amelio Show” suggests that the viewers are entitled to it. “The main goal of ours is to tell the true story of us,” Marc, Charli and Dixie’s father, says in an early episode. The show becomes more disturbing then, as perhaps unintentionally, the line between fan and celebrity gets blurred, and the D’Amelios get further entrenched in their own fandom, something that is clearly already hurting the sisters.
It might be too late to do anything about all of this, or to stop the vitriol that these two young women are experiencing every day. But the existence of “The D’Amelio Show” and the increased access it provides to their lives are certainly not helping. For the sake of the D’Amelio’s themselves, here’s hoping the show does not return.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AMC’s newest dramedy series, “Kevin Can F*** Himself,” made waves over the summer with its exploration of the classic sitcom format through the eyes of Allison McRoberts (Annie Murphy), a stereotypical sitcom wife struggling to break free of that role and escape her husband Kevin (Eric Petersen). The show has drawn critical acclaim for its portrayal of Allison’s awakening and its use of two formats, multi-camera sitcom and single-camera drama. The Harvard Crimson spoke to creator, showrunner and executive producer Valerie Armstrong. [Editor’s Note: Since this conversation, AMC announced that “Kevin Can F*** Himself” was renewed for a second season.]
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: Starting at the beginning, where did the idea for “Kevin Can F*** Himself” come from, and when did you start working on it?
VALERIE ARMSTRONG: I came up with the idea now over two years ago; it was June of 2017, and I was still an assistant... And I was writing on my own time, and nobody was really interested in what I had to say, but if you're trying to be a writer and you're an assistant, you should just always be working on something. I was listening to this podcast… called “The JV Club,” and it was Janet Varney talking to women about their high school experiences, and I loved it. But on this episode, they were talking about pilot season, and about how every year they go out for the “Sitcom Wife” — still. They are always told by their agents, like, “they want a really funny woman for this role — like, she gets jokes.” And then they'd get the sides for the audition and see that all of their lines were things like, “What do you mean?” Just set-ups for the men in the room. And I remember thinking, “That sucks, how is that possible? How are these women, the women I would kill to be writing for, still auditioning for this and also not getting [the parts]?” And I got really annoyed, and I thought, “God, I bet I bet the woman married to that [sitcom] guy is actually really miserable.” And the idea sort of came to me.... it was just the first format switch, the image of it… It really excited me. And it's been over four years of working on it.
THC: The show takes place in a bleak Massachusetts town with a specific atmosphere, but the Sitcom Wife character could live anywhere. What drew you to that place?
VA: I wanted to write the people I grew up with, because I felt like I don't see them all that often on TV... I grew up in the place I'm currently sitting now: Milford, Connecticut, which is a nice little seaside town, but it's by no means fancy. [There are] a lot of hairdressers, and mechanics, and that's great — a lot of people who work to live, not live to work. And I also loved the northeastern attitude and psychology because I understand it so well, so it's easier to write. You know, “If it's nice out, that's just because it's not raining yet.”… But I knew I didn't want to set it in Connecticut, because people hear Connecticut and they assume upper-class. So I thought of Worcester, because my brother's college roommate was from Worcester… he knew all the flaws in his city, he was sort of embarrassed by it, but at the same time, immensely proud of it… And I thought that was a really good place to set this show, which has this glossy finish to it and a lot of chauvinistic, unearned pride, [showing] the rot beneath it in the single-cam.
THC: I was struck by how immersive the two different formats felt, especially the sitcom parts. How did you get in the headspace to write in two different styles?
VA: I tend to write them separately. If I'm having a multi-cam day, I’ll stay in that headspace for a while, and same with single-cam... But it is amazing — I never wrote real hard comedy, even on my own time. My samples were, like, single-camera comedy, but certainly not setup-punchline, setup-punchline. I didn't think I could do it at all. But it turns out, if you watch a ton of sitcoms growing up, you know the pace, you know what it sounds like... It's sort of all built around Kevin. It was really hard not to give [Annie Murphy and Mary Hollis Inboden] too many jokes, because they're so good at it. But it is Kevin’s show. In the first season, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel, we're trying to comment on the wheel… And then for the single-cam stuff, it was like writing anything else I've written, where I tried to keep people talking the way that people talk. A joke on set was that you know I've written a scene if the line “yes, no, I mean,” was in there, because I start and stop and stumble and say “uh” and “like” all the time, so I always write that stuff in. And I tried to amuse myself as I'm writing, and write something I'd want to watch, and write people being human, and connecting and disconnecting.
THC: Did classic sitcoms and their genre conventions inform the background characters you brought in, like Neil and Patty?
VA: Oh, yeah. I started out writing the show thinking, who are the characters who I always see, and who do I want to see more of? To me, Neil's the sidekick, and Pete is the Kevin who has begotten another Kevin. And Patty is the sarcastic neighbor. And I thought, “Oh, god, there's probably so much more going on with her.” … At the end of the day, to me, the show is not at all about a toxic marriage. The show is about two women and how women can save each other. That's what made the show worth telling… When I think about the show, it's Patti and Allison on a porch. That's all I want to write. It's all I want to watch. But everybody came out of this archetype of like a sitcom character. And in the second season, God willing, we'll explore that even more.
THC: Do you have any new goals for the potential second season, having established this double-format style and explored Allison’s character more? Are there new themes you’re hoping to explore?
VA: Absolutely. Again, God willing. The show is never about whether or not Kevin dies. It's about how Allison lives…I don't want to do anything [different] format-wise, just because it suits me. That format switch means a lot to me... To me, the first season ends with Neil in single-camera, and there's a real reason for that... the format switch is a sort of metaphor for the benefit of the doubt that these guys get to walk through life with. People ask me all the time, “What's Kevin like in single camera?” He doesn't have to be in single-camera, which is a luxury — he doesn't have to deal with the consequences of his actions, not really, because that is what a sitcom is, right? It always regenerates. They never have to deal with stuff. And so he gets to have that benefit of the doubt, that laughing audience behind him cheering him on, and so did Neil. Until that moment where he did something so egregious that even the sitcom audience can't laugh anymore…. He has to face some consequences now. And that's it sort of like Season Two is: welcome to the real f*cking world, Neil! I love the idea of playing with that. But I'm not just gonna throw Kevin in single-cam for fun, you know, it needs to be earned to me. But we are talking a lot about sort of how to play with things in the second season and not just redo a first.
THC: On a side note, do you have any advice for readers who may be interested in writing or working in television?
THC: It's so lame, but [my advice] is just to work really hard and to seem so happy to do it. There's nothing I love more, as somebody who now hires people, then somebody who seems like they just want to help — like for the team, for the show — and someone who is a pleasure to be around. You really just have to be willing to stay late, be early, always have the answers… For writers specifically, it's trite, and I hated getting this advice, but everything changed for me when I figured out how I need to write — like what my system is for getting writing done. Mine works for me — I have to write every day, I have to write for an hour with a timer, and no internet, and rules, because that's how I work. It took me a really long time to get there. I think I started doing that when I was 27. But I literally haven't missed a day since... figuring out how I am productive, how I get things done, how to how to say with confidence, “I am a writer,” without feeling like a fraud: That changed everything for me…. Figuring out what being a writer means to you, how you can actually say that and mean it… That's the most important.

Witty, irreverent, and just plain weird, “The Suicide Squad” is a great summer blockbuster. It delivers a bonkers action-packed extravaganza filled with everything from delightfully creative and very R-rated murders to the hilarity of terrible people learning basic social skills.
“The Suicide Squad” is a soft reboot of 2016’s “Suicide Squad,” even featuring some of the same actors and characters, but disregarding most events of the preceding film. Since the previous iteration was truly unsalvageable, going in this new direction has allowed writer-director James Gunn the freedom to work the magic he’s known for. Indeed, Gunn’s film actually leans into its titular concept: characters die, villains behave villainously, and all of the main characters are disposable to those in charge — like, you know, a suicide squad.
“The Suicide Squad” is everything 2016’s version wanted to be: Where the previous iteration merely had several characters walking in the general vicinity of each other for an hour and a half and called that ‘family,’ 2021’s entry understands how to build believable and meaningful connections between its characters. Everything is earned, and it’s as easy to care about the characters as it is to laugh at them. The plot — a motley crew of untrustworthy superpowered convicts are sent to steal something from a country reeling from a military coup — quickly spirals into absurdity. While the ridiculousness goes a bit too far at times, Gunn handles the massive tonal shifts — from real emotional moments to slapstick mockery — reasonably well.
Conversely, the concept of villainy is considered with far more precision. As a film about villains, “The Suicide Squad” would surely fail to be interesting if it tried to follow the traditional superhero trope of protagonist facing and overcoming the antagonist. Gunn succeeds because his narrative considers what it means for an individual to be bad, as well as what it means when a figure in power is corrupt or an entire system is flawed. By treating the ideas of evil and malice with nuance, “The Suicide Squad” tells a compelling story about villains, without depriving them of all the traits that make these characters villains in the first place.
The most enjoyable aspect of the film has to be the wacky and interesting character work that the star-studded cast take on gleefully — Sylvester Stallone as the voice of a human-eating shark learning the meaning of friendship is a stroke of genius, and John Cena handles his role of a man willing to go to war in the name of peace with style. Daniel Dastmalchian as someone with deep-seated mommy issues who shoots polka dots from his arms and Daniela Melchior as a lethargic rat-loving adolescent each take on their respective odd-ball characters admirably.
Idris Elba kills it as the reluctant leader, and his character, Bloodsport, is an unequivocal improvement on 2016’s Deadshot; he’s grounded and compelling as he navigates his many complicated relationships. Harley Quinn’s return to the franchise is also welcome, as Margot Robbie is given an actual character instead of the shallow, misogynistic role she had to work with in “Suicide Squad.” And while Viola Davis is not given the most outlandish character — Amanda Waller is depressingly one note — her callous authority is central to the plot.
“The Suicide Squad” also joins the growing market of R-rated superhero movies, and Gunn certainly does not pull his punches in terms of gore or profanity. In fact, the violence is gratuitous within the first five minutes, and while some gory moments are clever or impressive enough to deserve their inclusion, there are many more that are simply excessive. There comes a point where the viewer doesn’t need to see someone’s organs ripped out every two minutes. While the executives at DC made the right move by disregarding the mess that was 2016’s “Suicide Squad,” it underscores how inconsistent the DCEU continues to be. Instead of an interconnected universe, their confusing roster of films is much more comparable to a sandbox where children pass action figures back and forth in an approximation of storytelling. Considering the budget and supposed expertise the studio has access to, the big picture is truly concerning.
Overall, however, “The Suicide Squad” is creatively shot, making use of excellent special effects, apt costuming — which unlike in 2016’s rendition, isn’t sexist — and an exciting soundtrack. As a ridiculous, clever and hilarious entry into the superhero genre, “The Suicide Squad” definitely deserves to be remembered as a summer hit.

“The Card Counter,” which opened in theaters this weekend, tells the story of William Tell (Oscar Isaac), a former army interrogator turned gambler whose tour of East Coast casinos is interrupted by the appearance of two figures from his haunting time in the service. Written and directed by Paul Schrader — the Oscar-nominated writer known for “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull” — “The Card Counter” is very much a writer’s movie, such is the detail and sophistication that makes it worth the watch.
From the film’s opening scenes, it is clear that “The Card Counter” is exactly the slow-burn think-piece that one might expect from a director like Schrader. Here, Schrader does nothing to try and snatch the audience’s attention; instead, his shots proceed methodically, with long takes that force the viewer to take a protracted look at each of the characters, and with shots that emphasize dialogue rather than action. Together, these directorial choices set the tone for a film rooted in a story well-designed to make one think.
Later on in the movie, Tell remarks that two things are important in poker: knowledge of the mathematical odds, and knowledge of the other players. The same holds true for the film as a whole. Like poker, this film is a study of character (the other players) as much as it is about the surrounding narrative (the cards). That there are really only three main characters in this film suggests that each’s surface-level simplicity shields a thought-provoking complexity.
There is never a doubt, though, that the true focus of the film is meant to be Tell, and the thoughts, motivations, and morals that are hidden below the surface of his steeled expressions. Indeed, his half-smile graces the screen but once throughout the entirety of the film’s two hour runtime. That the viewer is also privy to a small selection of Tell’s thoughts further suggests that, above all, “The Card Counter” is a study of this peculiar human enigma.
Though not incredibly exciting, “The Card Counter” is, if nothing else, intense. Schrader’s film is best characterized by the quiet tension that can be found both at the poker table and in the interrogation room. At times, the sounds of Tell’s belaboured breathing and quickening heartbeat can be heard faintly, an inventive auditory effect that brings viewers closer to the protagonist’s physical reactions to stress.
When the quiet is finally broken, the effect is powerful. The loudest scenes — which are few and far between — accentuate the emotional intensity of the film, at times pushing viewers straight into flashbacks of the deafening hell of Tell’s past life as an army interrogator, and at others allowing them to share in the exuberance of his new-found love. This thoughtfulness in the film’s sound design is also reflected in its lighting, color schemes, and use of distorted lenses, which aptly give each of the vastly different parts of Tell’s story a distinct textural feel.
More than anything, however, Schrader lets his strength as a writer do the talking. Almost like a novel, the plot develops slowly, purposefully, and with incredible precision: No detail is without its own importance, even if it is only to be revealed later in the film. That is where the genius of Schrader’s work lies. “The Card Counter” is a film that invites questions and inspires reflection: There are layers to understanding the work, and the screening experience does not end after leaving the theater. Viewers may find their appreciation of the film grow in the hours and days following its conclusion as they search for the answers to Schrader’s cryptic, riddle-like writing. And with the knowledge that even the smallest details matter, they may find themselves itching to rewatch the film, eager to get closer to understanding its characters.

“Free Guy,” an action comedy that premiered Aug. 13 and follows the story of a non-playable character in an online video game and his developers, fits right into the filmography of its director Shawn Levy. At best an unremarkable afternoon filler in the vein of the “Night in the Museum” series, Levy’s latest falls flat, delivering a disappointingly shallow, uncaptivating, if passable picture that squanders a refreshingly original premise. The root of the movie’s issue is that it succeeds at its aim, perfectly encapsulating the character of video games even though such a one-to-one adaptation has no right to — and indeed doesn’t — succeed in another, vastly different medium. Instead of making the concessions necessary to craft a picture that manages to both do justice to video games and actually work as a movie, the filmmakers chose an uncompromising approach that embraces the video game aesthetic, but also an overreliance on easter eggs that few can appreciate.
Guy (Ryan Reynolds) is a bank teller and a non-playable character (NPC) who happens to also be completely unaware that he is a character in the online video game “Free City.” The game was developed by Antwan (Taika Waikiki), using code stolen from Millie (Jodie Comer) and her friend Keys (Joe Keery). Millie searches for proof of the theft, which leads her to meet Guy, who soon starts believing that Millie is the love of his life. Their encounter causes Guy to break with his pre-programmed routine, eventually leading him to find out the truth about himself.
On the surface, the movie does bear a resemblance to elements of “The Matrix” and “Ready Player One,” layered on top of the extravagant visual aesthetic of “Birds of Prey.” The mix seems like a recipe for a surefire success, but Levy and screenwriters Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn seem to lack, if not the ability, then at least the confidence to execute the premise.
The movie’s approach to special effects lacks grace and any semblance of moderation. “Free Guy” is visually grotesque from the get-go. An exaggerated sequence of police chases, gunfights, and utter destruction welcomes the viewer to the movie. The scenes could be given a pass as a clever way of exposition through juxtaposition, if not for the narrator needlessly spoon-feeding the audience the exact same information. As is, it’s an opening to a tiring, all-you-can-eat buffet of action that can’t compare with the whimsical violence served at the visual feast of “Birds of Prey.”
Gore and explosions are a must for an action movie, but a film should offer more than an epilepsy-inducing stroboscope light. Rather than a captivating story, the film offers a vaguely connected flow of narratively uncalled-for events with no sense of urgency. Stakes aren’t established until a full hour into a 115-minute movie. Millie’s initial desire for rightful recognition is contrasted with Keys’ indifference, undermining its validity, and is eventually set aside. Guy, depicted as an actual individual since the moment he fell in love, is in the end revealed not to be acting out of his own volition, but rather because he was programmed by Keys to love Millie.
Levy also squanders Waikiki’s acting acumen, turning his antagonist into a cardboard cutout. Antwan is nothing but a one-dimensional Boomer more reminiscent of the pre-transformation Ebenezer Scrooge than the affable Scrooge McDuck, and the character doesn’t prompt the kind of antipathy required of an antagonist. Outside of the “real” world in the movie, the acting is best described as parodical, too much even for an action comedy, with the stilted expressivity of a high school drama club or a Nickelodeon animated series, but it’s hard to see the poor performances as a flaw within the context of the film — what else could be expected of NPCs in a video game?
Therein lies the issue with the movie. Its gaudiness is fully understandable given the premise. Levy created a picture that has an undeniable appeal to the gaming demographic. Any viewer familiar with video game films is likely to appreciate the pandering, be it in the form of lightsabers or references to RPG staples such as an informant in a dark alleyway.
“Free Guy” is, overall, an exercise in mediocrity. Unfortunately, for Lieberman and Levy, the confluence of video games and cinema meant bringing in real-life Youtubers at the expense of making a quality action movie.

Perhaps the most anticipated upcoming release from the Marvel Cinematic Universe is Jon Watts’s “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Its long-awaited trailer has been described as “the Holy Grail” of trailers, and so far, it’s living up to the hype. The thrilling teaser is the most watched movie trailer in history, garnering a staggering 355.5 million views in 24 hours — beating out “Avengers: Endgame” by almost 70 million views.
The three minute trailer clearly establishes what will kick off the plot: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggling to deal with the aftermath of the cliffhanger ending of “Spider-Man: Far From Home.” His secret identity has been revealed, and he’s been framed for the death of the villain Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). Any chance at a normal high school life has been lost. Peter seeks out none other than the sorcerer Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a risky spell that would make the world forget his identity as Spider-Man. The spell seemingly goes wrong, and chaos ensues.
In the tangled web of countless MCU characters and crossovers, it would be easy to lose sight of what makes Peter Parker such a well-loved character. Superpowers aside, he’s just a high school kid who wants to prove himself, fit in, and lead a normal life. Seeing this intimate, relatable side of the character has been one of the most satisfying aspects of Peter’s earlier appearances. Thankfully, this new trailer reassures viewers that the new film has not forgotten this. It shows Peter falling through the warped fabric of reality and moving through a crowded high school hallway, fighting supervillains and FaceTiming his girlfriend, MJ (Zendaya). This trailer promises not only a stunning spectacle, but a character arc for Peter as he reconciles the two sides of his life.
The Spider-Man character has had an interesting history in films. Prior to the character’s inclusion in the MCU, there were two distinct Spider-Man franchises, both produced by Sony. Now, Disney and Sony share the rights to the character. With the MCU’s recent introduction of a multiverse, fans are eagerly anticipating crossovers between these different franchises. And the trailer does not disappoint: its very end teases multiple villains from the Sony Spider-Man films, like the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), both of whom Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man faced off against. For fans who first watched the Sony Spider-Man films almost two decades ago, the return of these characters is a thrilling twist.
The return of these villains raises the biggest question surrounding “No Way Home.” Will actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprise their respective roles as Spider-Man from the earlier Sony films? Many people involved with the production have denied their involvement (including the actors themselves), and there is no sign of them in the trailer. With that being said, fans desperately want to see three live-action Spider-Men on screen together. How else could villains from all these different franchises be defeated? While this trailer keeps us in suspense, it guarantees that come December, Spider-Man fans will be in for a truly spectacular cinematic experience.
“Spider-Man: No Way Home” is set to be released exclusively in theaters on Dec. 17, 2021. You can watch the trailer here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My first few weeks of college have been a whirlwind of emotions: awe at the beautiful campus, excitement to meet my suitemates, nerves to leave my family for the first time. And of course, buried underneath everything, doubt that I would be able to handle the transition.
Unlike the rest of my emotions, this was the one I refused to acknowledge. Sure, I was aware of the telltale signs of imposter syndrome poking through the surface and sure, I felt oddly called out every time a speaker at Convocation repeated that sickly sweet reassurance, “You belong.” But I convinced myself that the incessant voice in my head replying “Do I?” would quiet down once I started classes and slipped back into my pre-Covid rhythm.
My rhythm, however, is off-beat in this new environment. Instead of magically disappearing, my imposter syndrome skyrocketed the moment I stepped into my first class. As is customary at the beginning of any new school year, when hopes are still high and self-motivation still exists, I poured myself into pre-class preparation — skimming through the lecture notes, reading the textbook chapters, attempting the psets early — determined to start the year off on the right foot.
I think it would be appropriate to describe the jump from high school to college as a culture shock because I was anything but prepared for my classmates’ pace.
Despite my study marathon the night before, I found myself struggling to contribute to peer discussions. I anticipated being confused in class — it’s that fear that pushed me to put in the extra hours. But what I didn’t expect was to know the answer and still be afraid to raise my hand. My insights no longer feel unique as all my classmates are able to come to similar conclusions on their own, except faster and more articulately. I’d gone from barely studying and being at the top of my class to rereading and still falling short on the curve. Coming straight off the high school assembly line which discourages anything average, that means I feel like I don’t belong on the curve at all.
This mentality isn’t novel. When I began looking into Ivy League colleges, my sister recommended I read former Yale English professor William Deresiewicz’s “Excellent Sheep.” Deresiewicz dissects elite students’ tendencies to overexert themselves to simply feel like they fit in or deserve their accomplishments, while simultaneously trying to keep up a pretense of effortlessness. In short, students who have spent their entire high school career being defined by their achievements struggle to step off the treadmill; it is a constant race to the next milestone for self-validation. This imposter syndrome doesn’t have to be something that develops after setting foot on campus — it seems to breed much earlier on.
More importantly, however, Deresiewicz discusses how students feel alone in this phenomenon: Not only do we think that we don’t belong, but we also think that we are the only ones who don’t belong. It’s easy during class to feel disoriented when that one student continuously raises their hand and somehow knows all the answers. All of a sudden, it doesn’t seem like the notorious imposter syndrome affects everyone — just you.
But isolating imposter syndrome is not all I’ve found in these first weeks. I’ve also found that every individual I have been brave enough to vocalize my concerns to has experienced these same fears. Because most of what we hear in classes are correct answers, we begin to assume ourselves outnumbered for needing an extra minute to catch on.
I hope I’m correct in assuming that we are not the few, even if we feel like it. That it is okay to doubt yourself every once in a while as long as you acknowledge that everyone is in the same boat. Rather than feeling like you don’t belong, realize that your friends and classmates probably are right there with you.
There are bits of this imposter syndrome that I’ve found healthy: the adrenaline that pushes me to actually look over material before the lectures, the comforting community it can create if we acknowledge it. In a roundabout way, imposter syndrome can be one of the things that makes us feel more connected. We’re fortunate to attend an institution where everyone is brilliant, but that does not mean we are perfect. No matter how far we go, there will always be more to discover and people to learn from.
I want to adopt the College’s mission and expose myself to “new ideas, new ways of understanding, and new ways of knowing.” I may not be the smartest person in the room and that’s okay. Instead, I’m aiming to train myself to step away from the constant desire to outrun everyone else and simply focus on sharpening myself.
Perhaps if we can internalize this new goal, we can come to realize that we all belong among this crowd of imposters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We often hear that shopping week gives students a sense of “flexibility” or “exploration,” but what does that actually mean? I would like to tell the story of how shopping week changed my Harvard experience from terrible to transformative, to show the meaning of shopping week and why we must vote to restore it.
I arrived at Harvard in August 2018 with no connections and no idea of what college meant. I struggled to find a place at Harvard during my freshman fall. The culture at Harvard was utterly foreign to me, the professors were totally unapproachable, and I struggled to stay afloat.
In January 2019, Shopping Week changed everything. I wandered into a seminar room in Adolphus Busch Hall and discovered an upper-level history seminar titled HIST 1950: “Beyond ‘The End of History’: Rethinking Europe’s Twentieth Century, 1900-2018.” During the first class, Professor Charles S. Maier upended my assumptions about history. I thought history was about memorizing facts and figures. Instead, history taught me about how societies have changed and can still change. Professor Maier made history come alive.
I was instantly hooked, but I was entirely unqualified to take the course. Nevertheless, thanks to Shopping Week, I could linger after class and converse with Professor Maier. He not only agreed to let me into the course, but outside of class, he spent many hours teaching me one-on-one about history and life.
As someone who grew up struggling to learn English, I had no confidence in my writing ability. Still, Professor Maier’s mentorship helped me produce a 41-page paper exploring 20th century Britain’s relationship with the European Economic Community. Moreover, I gained confidence and started to find my footing. For the first time at Harvard, someone believed in me.
If shopping week didn’t exist during my freshman spring, I never would have wandered into that seminar room and met Professor Maier. I might never have found my footing. Instead, I would’ve picked random courses based on confusing Canvas sites under an early registration system. I would not have considered taking a course for which I wasn’t technically qualified. The online registration system might not have let me add that course to my Crimson Cart, let alone wander in and allow it to transform my Harvard experience.
Today, I’m a senior concentrating in History and Mathematics and pursuing a concurrent master’s degree in Computer Science. But what does that all mean? That means that thanks to several semesters of shopping week, I discovered courses ranging from energy history to atmospheric physics. Shopping week taught me to embrace the uncomfortable and explore widely, far beyond coursework. The spirit of exploration fostered by shopping week even gave me the courage to walk on to the varsity lightweight rowing team despite having no high school varsity athletic experience.
Shopping week taught me that college is not a series of trials to survive or resume lines to rack up, but rather a unique opportunity to reimagine who you are and who you want to be.
I share this story not to toot my own horn, but rather to demonstrate the central role of shopping week in changing lives and giving Harvard undergraduates the “transformative experience” that Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana celebrates. Shopping week is especially beneficial for students from less advantaged backgrounds, who often discover academic fields that they had never heard of before.
Unfortunately, shopping week might never come back if we don’t speak up. Harvard administrators have formed a Committee on Course Registration to consider alternatives to shopping week, and they will vote on proposals shortly. One of the committee’s major proposals is an early registration system where “students register for classes prior to the semester for which they are registering and are assigned to classes.”
That’s an even worse version of this semester’s confusing, dysfunctional course preview period. An early registration system would not only permanently eliminate shopping week, but could also force you to sign up for fall courses as early as May, with limited information to choose courses from.
My story would never have happened under the Committee on Course Registration’s early registration system.
If we speak up, we will restore shopping week. Administrators might call our concerns “unnecessary” but our professors will make the final decision on shopping week and their opinions may still be undecided. That means that we can change minds, and the outcome of any faculty votes, if we show our professors how much students care about shopping week.
That’s why the Undergraduate Council is holding a campus-wide referendum on shopping week, and as many undergraduate students as possible should vote. Voting opens Tuesday at 12 p.m. and closes at 11:59 a.m. on Thursday, Sept. 16 — you can vote on the UC website. It is crucial for us to vote “Yes” in the Shopping Week referendum and to ask our friends to vote, too. Voting takes just 20 seconds, and who knows, shopping week might just change your life.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, the Undergraduate Council’s Academic Life Committee Chair, is a History and Mathematics concentrator and concurrent Computer Science master’s degree candidate living in Quincy House. He is one of the organizers for the campaign to Save Shopping Week.

Harvard has finally divested from fossil fuels, in all but name.
Last Thursday, Harvard affiliates received what at first glance seemed like a pretty unremarkable email: another laundry list of University actions to combat climate change, this time with the subject “Climate Change: Update on Harvard Action.” But the discrete phrasing hid a shocking policy reversal: Harvard, after years of sparring with advocates, said it will allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire while avoiding new investments in the sector.
Though the term itself remained conspicuously unsaid, we read between the lines: our university is divesting.
We gladly welcome Harvard’s change of heart — we went through our own not too long ago. In his email announcing the decision, University President Lawrence S. Bacow chose to emphasize the practical reasons behind the policy shift, deeming fossil fuel investments not “prudent” in our decarbonizing economy. But along with these pragmatic concerns, we believe that divesting from fossil fuels has an important symbolic value.
As we’ve opined in the past, symbols matter. Our investments matter. They showcase our ideals and speak to our moral character, allowing Harvard to put its money where its mouth is (like we did with the tobacco industry in the 1990s) or fail to do so (like with our reluctant and partial apartheid divestment). The endowment, as a symbol of our institutional values, is hence inherently political; Harvard’s decision to free itself from fossil fuel investments shows our commitment to reducing the extent and impact of climate change.
Embracing this symbolic importance of fossil fuel divestment means, to us, actually using the word divest. It also crucially means recognizing those who brought the movement to our campus — the activists and organizers who, for years, pushed relentlessly for a better Harvard, and got one. From lawsuits against the University to “Heat Weeks” featuring faculty and alumni, the student activism has proven dynamic and determined in its tactics, capable of reinventing itself for the sake of the cause. Now, less than two years after the iconic Harvard-Yale protest sparked national headlines, their efforts are only a few withering contracts away from fruition. We thank them effusively for getting us here.
Harvard’s recent decision is, therefore, a testament t0 the power of student activism. The wealthiest academic institution on our warming planet has been moved by the blood, sweat, handcuffing, and tears of young people.
Let this moment serve as a reminder to our fellow young people everywhere: Demand the change from your universities that you wish to see. If they should divest, press them firmly, and persistently — because they will be made to listen to you eventually.
And in that vein, we have a few more asks of the Harvard Management Corporation. They should clarify the timeline of when the fossil fuel contracts in “runoff mode” will finally be liquidated. And even once Harvard has completely divested from fossil fuels, the work of extracting the endowment from morally untenable investments is not over: As we have stated before, the Corporation must also let go of any investments, or the potential for future investments, in the prison-industrial complex, an instrument of racism and modern-day slavery. The tool of divestment must be used to square the endowment with these social imperatives of our times.
Still, we cannot understate the magnitude of the moment that has just arrived. A moment almost a decade of activism in the making; a moment deserving of more than the convoluted email we received.
To the activists who have driven this change: We are not reliant on the University to give this moment the symbolism it deserves. We must celebrate this victory for what it symbolizes for climate action, for the principles of activism, and for Harvard itself.

The City of Cambridge highlighted its national recognition for excellence in data-driven local governance and its work to improve housing affordability, boost access to economic and educational opportunities, and combat the Covid-19 pandemic in a combined 2020-21 fiscal year report issued late last month.
The report notes that Cambridge was recognized this year as one of the top American cities at using data and evidence to improve residents’ lives with the What Works Cities Certification — an assessment of how well cities are managed by measuring the extent to which the city leaders use data and evidence in their decision-making processes.
According to the report, Cambridge is now one of only 13 Gold Certified cities in the country.
“This certification represents years of hard work from departments big and small throughout the City to use data to better serve the public,” Josh Wolff, Cambridge’s data analytics and open data program manager, said in the report.
The report includes a special feature on Covid-19 as the City had to divert much of its attention in the last year to the unprecedented global health crisis.
Following its declaration of a public health emergency on March 19, 2020, the city activated its Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund and created a new Housing Stabilization Fund to support residents financially throughout the pandemic.
According to the report, as of June 30 of this year, the city had spent a total of $25.5 million to support individuals, families, small businesses, the arts sector, and nonprofit partners during the pandemic.
In addition to the Covid-19 measures, the City Council prioritized increasing access to affordable housing, ensuring equal economic and educational opportunities, and strengthening the city’s commitment to using sustainable energy.
Since 2001, the City has allocated more than $246 million to invest in affordable housing initiatives, the report stated. The funding has been used to preserve or create more than 3,095 affordable housing units, including Finch Cambridge, St. Patrick’s Place, Frost Terrace, Squirrelwood Apartments, and other housing complexes.
The City also invested $500 million in three new school facilities in recent years: the Martin Luther King Jr. and Putnam Avenue Upper Schools, King Open and Cambridge Street Upper Schools and Community Complex — both of which are now complete — and the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper School.
The King Open School, which opened in late 2019, was designed to be the first near-Net Zero Emissions School in Massachusetts.
In fiscal year 2021, the city began rezoning two major sites: Canal District Kendall near the Longfellow Bridge and the site of the current MXD Substation in Kendall Square. Rezoning of these locations will lead to increased benefits such as an arts and cultural center, a winter market, and new affordable homes, according to the report.
Cambridge also continued its implementation of its Urban Forestry Initiative, which enables the city to expand the urban forest canopy, reduce the urban heat island effect, and be more proactive about climate change. Within the past two fiscal years, the city has planted 827 trees in public areas.

As Harvard's campus roars back to life this fall, many undergraduate Houses are resurrecting long-standing ceremonies and traditions to welcome new and returning House members.
“It’s just a wonderful sight, and a wonderful experience to interact with our community in our dining halls, in our courtyards,” Lowell House Faculty Dean David I. Laibson ’88 said.
Some Houses kicked off the start of the semester with time-honored traditions, such as Pforzheimer House’s Camp Pfoho and Quincy House’s Field Day.
While Camp Pfoho — an annual Pforzheimer House outing to a summer camp in western Massachusetts — was delayed for juniors by the forecasted Hurricane Henri, students were still able to participate, according to Pforzheimer House Faculty Dean Anne Harrington ’82.
Activities ranged from kayaking and swimming in a lake to wall climbing and archery, Harrington said. Camp Pfoho began with icebreakers so students could get to know each other.
“One of the things we’re extremely conscious of is that people don’t know each other, even in their own cohort, in the ways that they would have had they not been coming off the back of this pandemic,” she said.
Quincy House's Field Day featured games pitting class cohorts against one another, among other traditions.
“Field Day goes back sixty-plus years,” Quincy House Faculty Dean Eric Beerbohm said. “It begins with a bagpiper and has an exorcism.”
The exorcism utilizes House namesake Josiah Quincy III’s cane to banish evil from the House.
Beerbohm said that the exorcism was “updated” to exorcise modern-day sins from the House, such as microaggressions and mansplaining.
In previous years, Houses hosted an orientation for new sophomores. Because many juniors had never been inside their house before, Houses held an orientation for both sophomores and juniors.
Eliot House hosted a series of events geared towards those two classes, such as tours of the House and scavenger hunts.
“We really tried to focus on getting to know those spaces in the house,” Eliot House Faculty Dean Stephanie A. Paulsell said. “There’s lots of cool secret spaces in this house. There’s a dark room and a ballet room and a movie theater and a beautiful library.”
In Dunster House, sophomores and juniors went on a cruise along the Boston harbor.
“For the first time this year, we did it as a sunset cruise,” Dunster House Faculty Dean Sean D. Kelly said. “Moving the cruise to the early evening was amazing.”
Seniors were not left out of the welcoming ceremonies.
“We did a toast for the seniors at sunset in the courtyard the weekend they arrived,” Dunster House Faculty Dean Cheryl Chen said. “We had prosecco and sparkling cider and chocolate-covered strawberries.”
Beyond welcoming ceremonies, some Houses have also brought back beloved traditions.
Lowell House had its first in-person Lowell Tea, a weekly tea that welcomes students from every house, on Sept. 2. According to Laibson, a "team" of bakers led by two Lowell House residents prepare pastries and finger food for guests.
“It is a really wonderful tradition that goes back probably almost a century,” Laibson said.
A rise in coronavirus cases on campus at the start of the semester forced Lowell House to temporarily discontinue the weekly tradition.
Laibson said he is looking forward to future teas, though.
“We’re extremely eager to go back to Lowell Tea," he said. "It is held every week, and I hope you’ll join us."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in two years, members of Harvard’s graduate student union went to the polls Monday — both online and in-person — to decide whether to authorize their Bargaining Committee to call for a strike.
If two-thirds of voters vote yes, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ Bargaining Committee will be empowered to call for a strike at any time. The HGSU-UAW Elections Committee, which is overseeing the strike authorization vote, has yet to set a date to close polls; the vote opened Monday morning and will continue through at least Friday.
The Elections Committee will announce the end of voting at least three days in advance, according to Elections Committee member Andrew M. Bergman.
Harvard and its graduate student union have been in negotiations for the union's second contract since March. The University’s latest package of proposals to HGSU-UAW includes an approximately $14 million increase in compensation and benefits over the duration of the second contract, as well as an appeals procedure that could end in third-party arbitration for cases of non-gender-based discrimination. The union continues to call for higher levels of compensation and benefits, harassment and discrimination complaint procedures with direct access to third-party arbitration, and union security, among other issues.
HGSU-UAW’s first strike occurred in December 2019 following two years of bargaining for its first contract. More than 90 percent of voters approved the first strike in the 2019 authorization vote, which allowed current, former, and prospective student workers to cast a ballot. This time around, only HGSU-UAW members are eligible to vote. Student workers who are represented by the union but are not already members can simultaneously join the union and vote.
Union members can vote in one of two ways. On Monday morning, all current members of the union received a secure, one-time link from ElectionBuddy which they could use to vote online. Through the online election system, HGSU-UAW’s Election Committee can track who has voted but not how they voted, according to Bergman.
Student workers can also vote at in-person polling stations. The Elections Committee will be operating multiple polling stations Thursday and Friday, including at Science Center Plaza, Harvard Law School, and the Longwood campus.
Thirty percent of union membership had already voted online as of Monday afternoon, according to Elections Committee member Sannoy Das.
HGSU-UAW member Eliel Sanchez Acevedo said he believes a strike is an effective way to improve working conditions, as the union and the University reached a contract through mediation following the union’s first strike.
“In the end we got a contract — of course we didn’t get everything we wanted, but we got some good stuff,” he said after casting a ballot in favor of a strike at the Science Center Monday. “Now that we’re in person, we need to show them that we’re committed to do it again, if necessary, to increase the bargaining power.”
Swarnabh Ghosh, an HGSU-UAW member who observed some of the union and University’s bargaining sessions that were open to membership, wrote in a statement that he voted yes due to his concerns over issues of compensation, dental care, and harassment and discrimination procedures.
“I think this is an important vote as it has the potential to show Harvard that many student workers are increasingly disappointed and frustrated with its extremely slow progress on these basic, fundamental matters during a time of unprecedented crisis and hardship,” Ghosh wrote.
Rachel E. Petherbridge, who was recently elected to HGSU-UAW’s Executive Board as a trustee, also said she voted to approve the strike because she supports the union’s proposals for increased compensation and third-party arbitration for harassment cases.
“Our Bargaining Committee has done an incredible job negotiating on our behalf throughout this process,” she said. “But at this point, we have several issues that we both refuse to move on, and they’re issues that we think are so important.”
Petherbridge said she voted yes not only to improve her own condition but to empower all student workers.
“Unionization is about fighting for each other, being there for each other,” she said.
In an email to Harvard affiliates after HGSU-UAW announced its strike authorization vote, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that Harvard is “committed to reaching an agreement” with the union, but advised faculty and staff to plan for a potential strike.
“With HGSU-UAW raising the potential for a strike in the fall semester, it is critical that Schools and Departments begin local contingency planning for managing the impacts of a strike,” he wrote. “The Provost’s Office and its partner offices will continue to engage with leadership across the University as planning moves forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Environmental advocates from the Charles River Watershed Association held a forum Monday focusing on the impact of Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus on the Charles River and the region’s environment more broadly.
An outstanding issue the group discussed was “river runoff,” a term for excess water that enters a water system. The group is concerned that the less absorbent ground surfaces in a developed Allston will allow more pollution to run into local water bodies.
Janet Moonan, CRWA stormwater program director, discussed the ERC’s on-site stormwater management systems, which include measures like multiple water storage methods and absorbent gardens and vegetation that can hold stormwater, filter out pollutants, and let the clean water gradually seep into the ground. The site will be able to handle more than twice the amount of stormwater that city regulations require it to, she said.
“That's over the precipitation amount that's required, and that will help with reducing flooding in the area; it will help reduce peak discharges of runoff to the river,” Moonan said.
Moonan went on to say that the ERC development is going “above and beyond” by using “high solar reflectance material,” proposing a “bioretention outdoor classroom,” which would make use of the plants in the absorbent gardens, and complying with the new Massachusetts stormwater regulations.
The CRWA, however, still had questions about flooding mitigation during storms, green space, the protection of water quality, and the impact of construction for the Charles.
Moonan also outlined the Boston Water and Sewer Commission’s proposed solution to the Allston drainage system’s water capacity issues: the North Allston Storm Drain Expansion Project.
Fully funded by Harvard, this project drew political controversy in March. State Rep. Michael J. Moran and State Sen. Sal N. DiDomenico — who need to approve legislation for the project to proceed — said they would not consider the expansion until the BWSC and Harvard engaged in what they argued should be more meaningful stakeholder engagement.
Local resident and Harvard Allston Task Force Member Edward A. “Ed” Kotomori said at the meeting he is concerned that the information Harvard is sharing about the proposed NASDEP is incomplete.
“How do you expect us to understand the whole, if you’ve just given us pieces?” he said. “I would not approve this pipe, if you’re not going to tell us the whole story.”
Mark Handley, director of community relations for Harvard, thanked the local residents who attended and affirmed that Harvard is receptive to their input.
“I just want to tell people that Harvard is here, and we’re listening,” he said.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke added in an emailed statement that Harvard aims to create a “healthier campus and a more sustainable world” through its Allston developments.
She wrote the NASDEP would “improve the quality and cleanliness” of river runoff at “no cost to taxpayers.”
O’Rourke also wrote if “legislators” do not act, disaster could strike Allston if the area is hit by a significant storm that leads to flooding.
“The existing, undersized storm drain that serves much of the North Allston neighborhood will continue to exacerbate a serious and longstanding resilience infrastructure deficit in North Allston that impacts both Harvard and the surrounding residential community, and could needlessly continue to risk major property damage and disruption,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At its weekly meeting Monday, the Cambridge City Council unanimously passed two policy orders to provide restitution to Cambridge residents impacted by the War on Drugs and to explore a reparations pilot program to address slavery and racial discrimination.
Co-sponsored by E. Denise Simmons, Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, Quinton Y. Zondervan, these orders will use tax revenue from cannabis sales to help redress the “historic injustices” that still affect Black and brown residents today, according to the orders.
It has not yet been determined what percentage of cannabis sales will go toward these programs.
Along with the passing of this legislation, on Monday the Council voted to establish a Racial and Justice Equity Commission — a committee of housing, education, and economic opportunity experts among others — to help carry out the aims set forth by the policy initiatives.
Though Nolan said she was “very excited” to begin reparations work at the local level, she maintained that “true reparations” must come from the federal government.
“It is past time to discuss reparations, and I really hope our city can be a leader in these discussions around the country and show the way for others,” Nolan said. “Cambridge does have a legacy of benefiting from slavery, right through to adhering to these federal policies in the 1950s.”
Simmons and Zondervan credited activist Saskia VannJames, a member of the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council, as instrumental in crafting the reparations policy order.
“Saskia has been a tireless advocate,” Zondervan said. “She has just been tremendous in not only meeting with us and advocating on this issue, but bringing other community members into the conversation and really making sure that we get this right.”
The policy order draws inspiration from a pilot reparations program in Evanston, Ill., which in March became the first city in the United States to pay reparations for slavery. The program paid $400,000 in reparations to Black households in Evanston in the form of housing grants.
The restitution and reparation policy orders were introduced separately to highlight the War on Drugs and slavery as “separate but related issues,” according to Zondervan.
Both policy orders request that City Manager Louis A. DePasquale deliver a progress report on Oct. 4 to remain on track with launching the program in July 2022.
While Councilor Marc C. McGovern said he believed passing the orders was “absolutely the right thing to do,” he acknowledged that “anything that involves race” will lead to difficult conversations.
“I think one of our biggest obstacles in Cambridge when we talk about these issues is that we like to think we don’t have them,” McGovern said. “We’ve got to get over that hurdle to admitting that even here in the People’s Republic, we have major issues and structural racism.”
Toward the end of the meeting, the Council declared an emergency extension of the preference period for cannabis retailers recognized under the Economic Empowerment program. Under the two-year program, which went into effect in 2019 and was supposed to expire on Sept. 23 of this year, only those negatively affected by the criminalization of marijuana and people of color can operate a cannabis retail store in the city. The emergency extension will extend the period during which only economic empowerment applicants can operate a cannabis retail store.
The motion passed 8-1, with Councilor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. as the sole dissenter.
“We have been talking about this cannabis for years, and to be at this point here tonight having to declare an emergency, without any public input into how this regulation is being written — it’s just astounding,” Toomey said. “I really don’t understand why we’re at this point.”
In response to Toomey, Zondervan explained that the Council discussed the emergency extension “at length” at an ordinance committee meeting. However, the subsequent meeting to pass the extension “was not scheduled in time,” Zondervan added.

It’s a truth universally acknowledged that a Harvard student in possession of a single hour of free time must be in want of a confusing situationship. If you’re such a student looking for some ways to add a little spice to the garbage pit of your love life, seek no further — our curated list of activities is sure to make whatever the hell you have going on worse (somehow).
Picnic in the Pit<3
You know that random archaeological dig site in the Yard? Well, nothing says love like hopping over a low wire fence and sitting in a dirt pit together. Throw on some socks and sandals, grab a to-go cup of clam chowder from the dhall, and embrace the most disgusting date of your life while tourists and Yard security look on in horror. It’s sure to be a horrible time, but, hey, if you both get dirty and happen to need to shower at the same time...
Enjoy That Sweet FlyBy Chili Together
Are you a premed with seven free minutes seeking a hot date with your long-suffering engineering beau who essentially lives in the SEC complex? FlyBy (not us, the thing under Annenberg / in the SEC complex) may be just what you need to keep the romance alive. Spend 90 percent of your time together standing in line, and then speed-sip some chili beneath everyone’s favorite freshman dining hall as ambient noise drowns out any attempt at conversation.
Have a loud DTR talk in Loker Reading Room
Haven’t felt uncomfortably visible in a while? Let’s fix that. Hash out all your miscommunications with your paramour in the most intimidating study space of all time: Loker Reading Room. Distract future doctors with all the messy details of your relationship. Worst case, you’ll become the subject of some blocking group’s dinner… And if all goes well, the stacks are right there ;)
Scooter Race on Mass Ave
First one to get hit by a bicyclist has to buy dinner.
Fight a Turkey
There you are, on a romantic stroll through the Yard, when you spot them. The turkeys. Wandering in a pack. Looking menacing, as always. Now’s the time to earn your partner’s undying respect through hand-to-hand (hand-to-wing?) combat. You’re basically their knight in shining armor!
Campus Bathrooms Tour
It’s like a wine-tasting tour, but decidedly less sexy. This is definitely a choose-your-own-adventure date, but we suggest beginning with the terrifyingly ancient wooden toilet in the top floor of the Peabody Museum and ending with the restrooms in the basement level of the Science Center. Nothing says romance like the sweet smells of every tourist in sight using the same bathroom as you.
CVS
Just trust us. Wander the fluorescently lit liminal space of Harvard’s only convenience store until you both lose all grip on reality in the snack aisle.
Wishing you good health and emotional instability,
PAJ & RLR
