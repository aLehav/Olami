After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The hits keep on coming for Major League Baseball. On Saturday, Sports Illustrated broke the story that perennial all-star Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the 2003 season. Faced with these allegations, A-Rod quickly took the path of former Yankees Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte by admitting to his use of steroids. In explaining the doping, Rodriguez cited the pressures of his peers and the new $250 million contract he had inked that year with the Texas Rangers—which at that point was the largest deal in the history of professional sports.
While we applaud him for taking the route of honesty rather than elongating the investigation, as other players have chosen, the striking nature of this report is deeply troubling both to Major League Baseball and sports in America as a whole.
Professional athletes are paid to approach the physical limits of the human body, but it is the natural pursuit of excellence that spectators adore, not the artificial and chemically-induced performance that anabolic steroids and other drugs can produce. By fundamentally altering the body’s capabilities, steroids undermine the basic appeal of sport.
In addition to compromising the integrity of the game, these substances also have many deleterious health effects. While enhancing aerobic and strength capabilities in the short term, performance-enhancing drugs have been shown to cause many longer-term health conditions like heart disease  and liver damage—problems that should not affect professional athletes or the youngsters who aspire to imitate their sports heroes.
Major League Baseball must not forget this blow to the integrity of the game—which is especially painful because A-Rod was previously considered by many to be the savior of the steroid era in baseball—but move forward with better testing and prevention.
Although 2003 is not too far in the past, it is important to note that over the last six years the league has succeeded in cleaning up its reputation by instituting harsher penalties for substance users and more rigorous testing. Hopefully MLB will use this recent splash in the steroids mix as an impetus to intensify the campaign.
It should be seen as little surprise that Alex Rodriguez has joined the list of great players who have taken steroids. While his figure has not attained the Herculean proportions of Jose Canseco or Barry Bonds, the sheer prevalence of steroid use in Major League Baseball that A-Rod and others have described makes A-Rod’s drug use more predictable than shocking. His tale is simply one more on a sordid list from an era inexorably tainted by the stain of performance-enhancing drugs.
Thankfully, A-Rod has chosen to take the contrite and honest road in reaction to the allegations. Although the pinstripes he wears may prevent him from ever being a fan favorite in Red Sox Nation, through his openness and regret, he still has the chance to salvage his legacy.  Now Major League Baseball must demonstrate similar accountability if it hopes to save its own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I secretly want to be president. Well, at least my roommate thinks so—something to do with all the government courses I’m taking.
Of course, if he were right, I wouldn’t be alone. More than one politico running for Undergraduate Council last semester didn’t bother keeping their political ambitions secret. And the honest ones are just the tip of the iceberg. In an interview, UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10 said, “You ally yourself to people. It takes a year or so to reveal why they’re really doing it. We’re all doing it because we want to be senator and governor and president.”
Flores herself wants to be governor of New Mexico, and she’s not shy about it. She has no reason to be. Most of us are guilty of it—planning our college careers always with a mind toward that high-rise office or that Nobel Prize. It’s why we’re here, isn’t it?
Michelle Obama never thought so. The passion she has always exhibited for her work, regardless of the recognition it promises, is one that few politicians can match. For that reason, Michelle is more important than her quick-witted quips and J. Crew-clad deportment might suggest. She’s walking proof that our most important heroes often shun both the podium and the history books, working one day and one cause at a time.
At Princeton, she wanted to change the world just as much as any college liberal, but she didn’t run for student government. Instead, she spearheaded a literacy program for people in the local community. And, at Harvard, Michelle was never president of the Law Review, but, through a minority recruiting program, she did give numerous undergraduates the chance to study here.
“For her, politics wasn’t so much about being inspirational as it was being practical—about getting something specific done,” one of her former professors told Newsweek. “She was not trying to get ahead.”
But Michelle can be more than a role model for aspiring social activists. The President too has always described his wife as his “rock”: the one who insists staunchly that, in the midst of roaring crowds and political logrolling, he remain focused the principles he’s been fighting for. At the same time, she works hard to keep the rock-star-in-chief’s feet on the ground. After the startling loss in New Hampshire during the primaries, she reportedly remarked to the campaign team, “We need to send a message to all our supporters to not take a single thing for granted.”
Now that she’s first lady, I hope that Mrs. Obama can make the pragmatism that she had on the campaign trail contagious, reminding all Americans, as she does Barack, that high-flying oratory can only take us so far. The president is a powerful symbol, but he will not be the one to lift us out of the recession. To do that, we will need talent and shrewd leadership in thousands of places that are far from the spotlight.
Don’t get me wrong: America needs its fearless leaders, and Harvard graduates are justifiably trusted to fill the nation’s most influential positions. At the same time, more bids for power have been spurred by the desire for recognition than the drive to change people’s lives for the better. The result is a dearth of talent in the places where no prestige comes with it. To this end, Michelle Obama has been an inspiring example.
Michelle will neither relegate herself to a nonchalant homemaker nor presume to play the policymaker. Whatever balance she strikes between the two extremes, her lower-profile, more direct initiative is a welcome departure from the Armani-clad Harvard students who flock to the IOP’s liaison program, hoping to cultivate whatever connections might give them a rung up on the political ladder a few years down the road. No matter what cause she chooses to devote herself to, I hope that all Americans, especially Harvardians, pay special attention—sometimes the people most deserving of praise fly below the radar.

Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi must have seemed an incongruous sight—bedecked in his lavish, though traditional, gold attire with trademark sunglasses, the leader of Libya humbly laid his head down on the table at the African Union summit in Ethiopia in a gesture of diplomatic defeat. The normally confident Gaddafi was facing stiff resistance to his newest geopolitical plan, the United States of Africa.
Unsurprisingly, many African nations have reacted coolly to Gaddafi’s plans for a politically united Africa, with the relatively wealthy and stable nations of South Africa, Ethiopia, and Kenya taking a prominent role in the opposition.
Yet despite Gaddafi’s personal failings as a controversial political leader and the sheer impracticality of his vision, he is right to advocate better integration and accountability on the African continent.
The role of unifier and diplomatist for all of Africa might not seem naturally suited to Gaddafi, but his persona will ensure that his efforts receive plenty of publicity. In his 40 years of dictatorial rule, Gaddafi  has reinvented his identity as a leader almost as many times as he has stunned with his exotic outfits and female bodyguard. Nor has his rule been without controversy; Gaddafi’s four-decade-long tenure has seen the imposition and removal of sanctions and several high-profile incidents with Western nations, most notably the Lockerbie bombing of 1988, which saw a Pan Am plane explode over Scotland, killing hundreds of innocent civilians.
But, in 2003, Libya pulled an abrupt diplomatic about-face, relinquishing its nuclear program and re-opening ties with Western nations. Though his outfits remain ridiculous, his current identity is not one of warrior against the West, but “King of Kings,” as Gaddafi had himself declared in high style at a public ceremony in Libya last year. With its record of civil war, coups, and regime changes, the African community cannot ignore any ruler who has held power for as long as Gaddafi. Even if they tried, they would be hard-pressed to forget a self-proclaimed high king with such a flair for the dramatic—who happens to rule a country with the oil to support his tastes.
Gaddafi’s high profile has immediately forced the countries of the AU to take notice. The BBC reports that his initial push has been deflected with nations set to reconvene in three months.  Yet to assume Gaddafi’s plan was a simple, direct push for unification underestimates the wily dictator. Unification in Africa is now a topic that will not fade away, at least for the next year of Gaddafi’s chairmanship.
With so many challenges to face, the AU should not resist efforts to bolster its power and infrastructure. Gaddafi might go too far in his suggestion of one military force, one currency, and one passport, but perhaps measures to this effect would help prevent the internal strife and lack of accountability crippling parts of Africa today.
A case where greater African unity could have a major impact is the failed state of Somalia, where a vicious internecine conflict has raged since the collapse of central government in 1991. Somalia has been a center of lawlessness and disorder for some years now, and failed military intervention by the United States and Ethiopia in 1993 and 2006 demonstrates that only a much stronger, multilateral African group can have any hope of success.
To make matters worse, Ethiopian troops are leaving Somalia, and the AU’s armed forces cannot step in to maintain peace in the country. The AU troops in Somalia consist entirely of Ugandan and Burundian troops, and according to reports these troops are planning to leave the country, with the Ethiopians even staying longer than planned to protect their retreat.
This development represents not only a military withdrawal, but also a defeat for the AU and its ability to promote stability and order in its nations. Gaddafi’s pressure to bolster the AU can only help in this regard; though a continental army might be impractical, greater cooperation and expansion in the AU’s armed forces is necessary in order to restore some sort of stability to Somalia and support the transitional federal government.
Gaddafi’s plan is especially important because of Africa’s complicated relationship with the United Nations and Europe. Many of the nations in positions to provide support and military assistance for the AU are the very nations that colonized Africa decades or centuries ago. Gaddafi’s call for a united Africa represents an African-born, African-comprised initiative.
This is especially important because of UN negligence in the region; the humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières has accused the UN of “ignoring” violence currently committed in the northeast of the Congo.  Moreover, the UN has limited resources and cannot devote all its attention to Africa.
Improving accountability and the role of the African community in self-policing are objectives seemingly in harmony with Colonel Gaddafi’s broader aims. Gaddafi’s grand ambition will likely not be realized in the near future, but it is important that he continue to raise the issue and move other African leaders to seek compromises with his policies that will move Africa toward a stronger, united position.
Africa’s other leaders may not fancy Gaddafi a higher African ruler to whom they should relinquish autonomy. His vision, however, could not be timelier. Africa has simply too many crises and areas of attention for the UN and current AU apparatus to cover. For those who envision an African community capable of handling its own problems and promoting peace, Gaddafi may prove the champion of such a dream.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By making theater more diverse and multicultural, we can make it more imaginative and compelling for a larger group of people. Last week, common casting at Harvard offered a perfect time to reflect in what direction we want our theatrical productions to take and to keep in mind how we can make theater more inclusive and relevant in future seasons.
Theater is not created in a vacuum but rather speaks to both our individual and social conditions. Kenneth Tynan, the influential English theater critic, wrote: “No theater could sanely flourish until there was an umbilical connection between what was happening on the stage and what was happening in the world.”  For that reason, the goals of producing a show should be much larger than merely to create what happens onstage.
We should communicate social messages. Moreover, our theater productions must provide an educational experience—not only for the cast and crew of that particular production—but also for the audience and community that the production encompasses. Sam Linden ’10, during a question-and-answer session for the recent production of “The Laramie Project,” quoted a friend who commendably stated: “Theater is education disguised as entertainment.” But we continue to forget what the essence of theater can be. In order to stage a show that “looks good” and “looks right,” we confine ourselves to precedent rather than liberate our ability to enable change. We tend to emulate the productions that have been seen in the past. In this way, we pass up an opportunity to theatrically create something entirely different and unique.
The quality of theater at Harvard is superb, but there is room for improvement. It should better reflect the community that it serves.  The philosophy behind common casting, that anyone should have an equal opportunity for a role, is perfect in theory but relatively unsubstantiated in practice. Many lead roles are continually played by actors of the same stripe and who have always played those roles.
Recently, there has been much work to make theater here more diverse and more inclusive.  BlackCAST, for instance, made a point of staging a gender-neutral and color-blind production this past fall. Hopefully, with the arrival of a new dramatic arts concentration and graduate school, and with more theater courses offered, formal training for more people will be more available and accessible.
However, this alone will not be able to resolve our problem of underrepresentation. More calculated risk-taking is needed, and better support in place to maximize the chance that cutting-edge productions can—and will—succeed.  Simply, we should try to cast some actors who do not typically populate our major shows. For many outsiders, the world of Harvard theater is exclusive and relatively confined. It’s time to shake things up.
I do not wish for a theatrical bent of affirmative action. Rather, I propose that directors and producers reevaluate what qualities they seek when they cast their actors and actresses. They should take a chance on recruiting fresh new faces. Students of multicultural backgrounds, who are traditionally underrepresented in theater, should not be discouraged by prior experiences. Instead, they should be able to keep training and auditioning for theater shows if the medium is truly something that they love.
Cultural groups, if there is an interest, should host their own theatrical productions as a way to train talent and provide more theatrical experience for more actors. In staging their own shows, these groups may find that theater is a meaningful way to explore cultural identity as well as display to others their cultural contribution of art and artists. Cultural groups can provide support, as well as provide consistency, for diverse Harvard theatrical productions.
During “The Laramie Project” pre-show panel, a show that I was fortunate to direct, Reverend Stephen Johnson noted that “The Laramie Project” is a play performed around the world. The reason why “The Laramie Project” was so popularly produced, he stated, was that people have found that the powerful message behind this one show is not just confined to one group of people in particular, but to all who face stereotypes and prejudice. The show is more popular and meaningful because of the diverse groups that perform it.
One can find similar universality in almost any theatrical production. In choosing to make theater a more inclusive place, another dimension is added to the message behind the play and the production. Those involved in the theatrical productions at Harvard can connect with a greater number of the audience and make the theatrical experience more meaningful and significant.

Bright young PhDs grinding through research may no longer see Harvard as the light at the end of the tunnel. As a result of the economic downturn, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has cut its number of faculty searches from 50 to 21. We understand that in this difficult financial climate sacrifices need to be made. Nevertheless, impeding the College’s flow of intellectual resources is an unwise compromise.
Harvard’s policy stands in contrast to some of its peer schools, notably Princeton and Yale, which are maintaining previous hiring levels. Harvard stands to lose talent to these schools, as young academics begin tenure tracks at other universities. There is no guarantee that these professors will be able or willing to move to Harvard later in their careers.
Harvard should instead take advantage of this bearish market to hire even more professors. This would be a smart investment, as the competition for sought-after talent is particularly diminished this season.Additionally, cutting down on new hires, along with constrictions on visiting faculty, creates a dangerous combination that threatens to impoverish the undergraduate educational experience. FAS is limiting the number of visiting professors next year; the economics department will have only two or three, compared to the 15 it has in the current year. Visiting professors often patch up a department’s curricular weaknesses, and their relative absence will likely deplete the College’s course offerings for undergraduates. Given the comparative lack of faculty, students will be faced with the dismaying prospect of fewer seminars and bigger Core and Gen Ed classes next year.
Moreover, regardless of the long-term budget concerns, students now still need to be taught. Harvard’s course offerings already fall short in many areas, and the hiring slowdown means departments across the College must wait further to fill their teaching gaps. The Economics Department is now searching for only one junior faculty member instead of two, the Classics Department cannot fill an intellectual vacancy in Greek history, and the East Asian Languages and Civilizations Department will not be hiring a pre-modern Japanese history professor.
Though these departments may batten down the hatches until the economic turmoil passes, the undergraduates currently interested in these fields cannot put their education on hold until the endowment climbs. The undergraduate experience is on a time limit, and each year that Harvard does not maintain its intellectual offerings is a year many students irrevocably lose out. 
Much of Harvard’s financial strength comes from its intellectual strength. Hiring fresh academic minds is an essential component of both. Continuing to hire could, in fact, be considered Harvard’s role in fighting the economic downturn.

What do a police officer, protective parents, and a ’90s rock song have in common? They’re all ways to break up a party. While police officers or parents may cause a visible scene, playing the wrong track is an equally effective, if more subtle, way to kill the mood.
From the regrettable “Barbie Girl” played at the Freshman Formal to the questionable playlist at “Sweet and Nasty,” Harvard’s party scene has seen more than its share of musical faux pas. The standard party features Lil Wayne, Ludacris, or even—heaven forbid—a Kelly Clarkson single. Almost no DJ, however, seems to play the kind of music that can actually get people’s feet moving—electronic dance music.
Electronic dance music, in its different forms—from techno, to house, to electro—has already taken over the club scene in Europe and the Mediterranean region. The world’s top clubs are concentrated in this area, and for good reason. The music played there supplies a unique beat that slowly builds up, tantalizing the senses, before erupting with euphoria, bringing together everybody in the crowd in musical rapture. Often the simple works best—a common theme in techno music, for example, is the repetition of a few lyrics, over and over, set against a continuous buildup of sound.
The best part of electronic dance music, though, is its versatility. It can satisfy a variety of different tastes, including either soft or hard beats and ranging in content from forbidden love stories to journeys of self-exploration. For math geeks, “Infinity 2008” by Guru Josh Project is sure to get you on your feet. Romantics should give “C’est Beau La Bourgeosie” by Discobitch a try. People into the Middle Eastern club scene will find a winner in Beirut Biloma’s “I Wanna Dance in Beirut.” And for those still in love with the ’70s, Bob Sinclair offers a whole new twist on that decade. Even movie buffs get a share with DJ Tiesto’s Titanic and Pirates of the Caribbean remixes.
It’s a shame that while Usher and Pink are household names, those with real talent like Tiesto, Paul van Dyke, and Armin van Buren remain unknown in the U.S. These musicians are the hottest names in techno in Europe, bringing to the dance scene more than just catchy rhymes and witty lyrics. As far as hit music goes, producers like Timbaland have proven that the beats make the song, and techno merely brings this idea to its logical apotheosis.
The unprecedented success the genre has met within Europe puts us to shame. And, beyond the music itself, it’s embarrassing that, while European DJs sample from musical traditions all over the world, America’s Top 40 often refuses to look beyond its own borders (resulting in infinite permutations of the same sugary mock-country tracks). 
It’s time for the dance scene here to catch up—especially at Harvard, where parties leave a bit to be desired. Next time you find yourself awkwardly bobbing to the Spice Girls’ “Wannabe” for the millionth time, ask the DJ to turn up the Tiesto.

Secretly or openly, many Harvard students harbor aspirations to be the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg. This behavior manifests itself in the skyrocketing number of student organizations and enterprises. There are clubs devoted to starting other clubs and businesses devoted to founding other businesses. Overall, despite the shrinking student funding resources and questions about genuine motives, this entrepreneurial bent is beneficial to the Harvard community. Students are better able to pursue their interests because of increasingly specialized organizations that bring in speakers and provide opportunities that would otherwise be absent. The entrepreneurs themselves also acquire valuable skills in the process—such as budgeting, networking, and managing—that will serve them well in the future. 
However, recent behavior this year has raised doubt about the “entrepreneurial” spirit of Harvard students. After Harvard-Yale tickets were sold out, it became apparent that there was a large gap between supply and demand. Students—such as seniors who did not want to miss their last Game—scrambled for tickets, pleading over e-mail lists for those with extra. Within minutes, some students offered up their tickets for free, at face value, or a little above. However, these benevolent e-mails were immediately followed by those from “entrepreneurial” students, who offered their tickets at a few hundred percent above face value. In some cases they even set up bidding wars, either officially on eBay or through the abbreviation OBO—“Or Better Offer.” These students are not entrepreneurs; they are extortionists. 
To be clear, I am not bitter about paying $80 for a ticket I could have obtained for free. Fortunately, I collected my tickets early and escaped the extortion. A further point of clarification: I took Ec 10. I know about the value of price discrimination and increasing the overall utility by allowing market forces to settle on efficient prices. I respect—and am an advocate of—the capitalistic system. However, it is not acceptable for Harvard students to take advantage of their peers, especially for entry into an event that is devoted to fostering a sense of Harvard community. While we rejoiced when Harvard won the Game, our fellow ticket “brokers” tarnished our community well before kickoff.
However, this was not an isolated incident. We witnessed the recidivism of these student “entrepreneurs” in the days leading up to the joint formal of Mather, Winthrop and Currier Houses. Tickets were $15 each and sold out earlier than expected. Again, within a few minutes of the desperate e-mails on the house lists, some students began selling their tickets for as high as $75 or 500 percent of face value. The absurd prices prompted others to make their own mythical sales: “Selling formal ticket—first -born child/OBO.” Jokes aside, this behavior should not be tolerated for three reasons: It takes unfair advantage of our peers, particularly those on significant financial aid; it blemishes our sense of community; and it encourages the perpetrating students to continue their behavior.
Ticket scalping within the Harvard community is unfair to our peers. Granted, students could have collected their tickets earlier. But the penalty for procrastination should not be hyper-inflated prices. It is no secret that a large portion of the student body is able and willing to pay ludicrous prices to attend events like the Game, formals, and Commencement, but what of the students on significant financial aid? Though they would gain equal amount of pleasure from attending the Game, they face tradeoffs. When it comes to choosing between a football game and next semester’s textbooks, there is no contest. Therefore, these peers of ours have to be extra vigilant about collecting their tickets in time since they do not have their parents’ bank account to fall back on. 
Moreover, most of us take pride in the Harvard community. Events such as the Game and house formals are meant to augment our community spirit—indeed, these are the few times we exit our self-obsessed lives to fight against a common enemy (Yale) or enjoy one another’s company. Relationships between those who rip off and those who get ripped off, as well as all of the witnesses, are certainly strained. The exchange can be compared to the sketchy guy on the dance floor who is taking advantage of an inebriated peer, except the victim knows he or she has been ripped off. The mere knowledge that such predators live among us is shameful. Also, for a community that strongly believes in social justice, it is surprising that there have not been more objections to the extortion within our houses.
Finally, by tolerating price gouging, we encourage the perpetrating students to continue doing it. In the short term, savvy students will begin buying extra tickets to popular events that are guaranteed to sell out in the hopes of making a tidy profit every time a formal takes place. This is the most innocuous result, however. If these students, who almost certainly take pride in their financial acumen, have any political or business aspirations, they will eventually plague the broader community with their gouging methods. Given our current economic crisis and the recent impeachment of Illinois governor Rod R. Blagojevich (Senate seat: $500,000/OBO), there has been renewed discussion about ethical practices of our business and political leaders. Perhaps these leaders developed their avarice-driven ways in college, under the guise of entrepreneurship.
Though Harvard and our community should promote entrepreneurship, it is important to make a distinction between free enterprise and gouging. Students who attempt to rip off fellow students should be chastised, rather than encouraged by successfully completing transactions.

The Undergraduate Council unanimously passed a bill on Sunday creating an ad-hoc student relations committee that will aim to improve communication between the UC and the student body.The committee is charged with maintaining the UC’s Web site, sending out a weekly e-mail newsletter, and holding public town hall meetings, along with other outreach effortsAccording to Eric N. Hysen ’11, the UC parliamentarian, no undergraduates who are not members of the Council or the media are in the habit of attending UC general meetings. “We want to have events where any student will be able to come in and talk about what they want the UC to do,” he said.“The legislation itself is setting up a structure,” Hysen said. “[The bill is] not really a step one to fixing [the UC’s communications problem]—it is more like a step zero,” he said.The legislation is the first passed by the Council since the inauguration of Andrea R. Flores ’10 and Kia J. McLeod ’10 as president and vice-president last Monday.Daniel V. Kroop ’10, a UC representative who served as the campaign manager for the Flores campaign, said that the creation of the committee represented a fulfilment of one of Flores’ campaign promises.Kroop, who is currently the UC’s communications director, will co-chair the committee along with Amanda Lu ’11, the current public relations director. Lu said that the new committee would address the concern that students were not made aware of Council projects.Flores said that the UC Web site will be re-designed as a part of the new outreach initiative.“[Students can] still apply for a party grant technically on the Web site now,” Lu said, pointing to the current site’s outdatedness. The party grant fund was terminated in Oct. 2007 by then-Dean of the College David R. Pilbeam. “That is not acceptable,” she said.After Sunday’s meeting, UC members were required to send out e-mails to their house-lists summarizing the UC general meeting—a practice that was commonplace when Ryan A. Petersen ’08 served as president of the council, but which fell-off during the subsequent presidency of Matthew L. Sundquist ’09.“I think that the UC can always do a better job of communicating. It is a difficult job to tackle,” Sundquist said of the outreach effort. “It is hard to figure out a way to break through the noise.”Despite the difficulties involved, Sundquist readily admitted that the emphasis on communication was worthwhile.“The more people that know about something, the greater chance it has to succeed,” he said.—Staff writer Eric P.

Nobel Prize-winning economist and acclaimed New York Times columnist Paul R. Krugman presented a sobering forecast for the U.S. economy at the First Parish Church of Cambridge yesterday evening. 
In a conversation with Professor David R. Gergen of the Kennedy School, Krugman said that he disapproved of the latest version of a U.S. bank bailout plan scheduled to be announced today. 
The plan, Krugman said, was on too small a scale, and would prove little better than “rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic and then bailing out some water.” 
Krugman added that he thought that only a stimulus plan 50 percent bigger than the one proposed by the administration of President Barack Obama could rectify the self-reinforcing nature of the current economic crisis.
To solve the current economic problem, the government must be willing to run up a 40 percent budget deficit, Krugman said.
“The risk of not doing it is greater than running up the debt required to do it,” he said. 
Gergen poked fun at the current stimulus bill, stating that the proposal’s approval rating is 20 percent lower than that of Obama himself. 
But Krugman’s proposal to increase the stimulus package received applause from the crowd. 
“I’m on board,” said Allston resident Dan Burgess. “I just finished Krugman’s book, ‘The Conscience of a Liberal,’ and am swayed by his line of argument.”
Some of the feedback following the event appeared to be breaking down along party lines. Legislative Director of the Harvard College democrats William F. Weingarten ’11 said that he admired Krugman’s economic expertise. 
“Paul Krugman exemplifies the best of the liberal economic tradition,” he said. “Even if you disagree with him, you can never doubt that his arguments are based on solid logic and verifiable facts.”
But Harvard Republican Club President Colin J. Motley ’10 said that he disagreed with Krugman’s leftist economic policies. 
“Krugman has the wrong idea with respect to the domestic economy,” he said. “Krugman disagrees with Obama and advocates a larger stimulus package, so he is in effect going against the popular opinion.”
Yesterday’s event was co-sponsored by the Cambridge Forum and the Harvard Book Store.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to reduce personnel costs while avoiding immediate layoffs, the University will likely finalize plans by the end of the month to offer an incentive package for early retirement of staff workers across all schools.
The plan—which has been on the table since the University increased budgetary scrutiny in the fall—would allow staffers to voluntarily choose early retirement instead of facing the risk of layoffs, said Sara Oseasohn ’74, associate dean of the arts and humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Harvard’s endowment, valued at almost $37 billion last June, was buffeted by current financial conditions, losing roughly 22 percent of its value by the end of October and sending the University scrambling to find ways to trim costs. Amidst subsequent belt-tightening measures—including a hiring freeze on FAS staff announced in November—the specter of possible layoffs has loomed over some staffers worried that their jobs may be in jeopardy.
“What we’ve been trying to do all along with the budget reductions is to think of all the possible ways [to cut] without affecting people,” Oseasohn said, calling an early retirement “a less painful thing than saying we’ve got to let somebody go.”
As part of a quarterly financial review process, FAS financial officers met yesterday with department administrators from the FAS division of social sciences and will be meeting with members of the other divisions later this week.
Though the early retirement plan has yet to be finalized, the budgetary planning process is proceeding in these meetings with the expectation that an incentive package will be implemented, according to Oseasohn.Even if the early retirement proposal were realized, Oseasohn said she would not rule out the possibility of layoffs, deferring a complete determination until April, when budgetary planning will be finalized and units will know if they need more cuts.
It also remains possible that retiring now in the midst of a bleak financial climate may not be an appealing option for many staffers—even with increased pension benefits.
“Obviously in today’s economy, people aren’t going to rush into [retiring],” Oseasohn said. “To tell you the truth, even if the University decides to do it, it’s not clear that it’s going to make a huge difference in the budgets.”
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said the incentive package could  increase the financial security of the union’s longer-term members—especially those who are nearing retirement anyway. 
“We would welcome it,” Jaeger said. “We would be very much looking forward to working with the schools to make good use of the program and make sure that people don’t lose their jobs unnecessarily.”
If the retirement incentive plan comes to fruition, it will not be the first time Harvard has offered to increase pension benefits for staffers who retire early. During an economic recession in 1991, the University created an early retirement incentive program for all non-faculty employees over the age of 55 who had worked for the University for at least 10 years.
Oseasohn compared Harvard’s plans for retirement packages with an early retirement incentive plan announced by Dartmouth in December, calling the Dartmouth plan “remarkably similar to the kinds of things that are happening here.”
Dartmouth’s plan is nearly identical to Harvard’s plan from 1991—all employees over the age of 55 who have been Dartmouth employees for at least 
10 years qualify for the program.

Democratic Congressman Artur G. Davis ’90 of Alabama declared his candidacy for governor on Friday, putting himself in the running to become the state’s first black governor, and leading many in the media—and even Davis himself—to draw parallels between the aspiring governor and President Barack Obama. Davis—the first congressman outside of Illinois to endorse the future president—led Obama’s campaign in Alabama and referenced his strong connection with the president in his candidacy announcement on Friday.“There was a time when what I am about to try to do seemed as inconceivable as the idea of a Kenyan and a Kansan with Confederate roots joining to give birth to an American President,” he told the crowd in Birmingham.The two men—one recently inaugurated as the first black president, the other the congressman of his state’s Seventh District—overlapped at Harvard Law School by one year. Obama graduated in 1991 and Davis in 1993.At Harvard, Davis was studious and serious, with an addiction to politics, according to freshman roommate Joshua M. Levisohn ’90.  “He was a government geek of the highest order,” Levisohn said.  “He loved everything about government and covered politics incessantly.”During the 1986 midterm election Davis knew about every congressional race and every candidate, Levisohn said.  “Some people are obsessed by baseball, or statistics,” he said. “Artur was obsessed by politics.”At the Law School, Davis won the Best Oralist Award in the prestigious Ames Moot Court Competition, and after graduation, he went on to work at Alabama’s Southern Poverty Law Center and as a federal prosecutor.Davis took his congressional seat after narrowly defeating Earl F. Hillard, a black democrat, in the 2002 primary. He has been in congress for the past seven years. —Staff Writer Laura G. Mirviss can be reached at lmirviss@fas.harvard.edu.

In order to cope with the long-term challenges posed by a budgetary shortfall of at least $100 million, departments and centers of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences are working to refine proposed budget cuts—a process concurrent with more over-arching cost-reduction measures being spearheaded by the administration.In an interview last month, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said departments have submitted proposals detailing areas that could sustain cuts. The “vast majority” of departments have founds ways to trim 15 percent of their budgets in keeping with a recommendation Smith made in December, the Dean said.“Part of the issue here is we can’t stop the business of the whole education process as we’re moving forward,” Smith said, emphasizing the importance of supporting current operations while planning for the future through the more general “80% FAS-wide plan” announced in January.The plan—which will aim to close the projected $100 to $130 million budgetary shortfall—is an early attempt to begin turning localized feedback from individual units within FAS into a more generalized scheme for cutbacks.“It’s a much more macro thing, as opposed to what’s happening today,” Smith said. “It needs to be guided by what we’re trying to do over the longer term.”Smith wrote in a letter to FAS faculty and staff that he was working with fellow deans to develop the plan by the end of January, but administrators have yet to release more information on the plan, and department leaders interviewed by The Crimson in the past week expressed confusion regarding its specifics.Meanwhile, departments have been coordinating with divisional deans to hone in on areas that can be cut, according to Statistics department administrator Betsey B. Cogswell. She said the department is currently waiting for confirmation of a proposal for a 15 percent reduction in the budget. Though Smith’s 15 percent benchmark for cuts came in a December faculty meeting, the FAS Dean has acknowledged that in the final budgetary plan, some departments may have to trim more or less than that figure.“I think the administration is trying to get a handle on what happens in individual departments, and what one department needs is not necessarily what another department needs,” Cogswell said, foreseeing a disparity of as much as 10 percent between departments. “We’re all so different.”Some surmise that the science divisions may see the largest budget reductions.“It’s the natural sciences which are going to be critical in this process because that’s where the big money is,” said Richard Tuck, chair of the social studies committee.Robert E. Holt, a laboratory administrator in the Chemistry department, said that he has been told that FAS funding of the department may decrease by over 20 percent.Finding places to trim poses a unique challenge to smaller departments, in which staff salaries take up a large proportion of budgeted funds. Staff salaries are not under the purview of departments, according to Daniel G. Donoghue, the English department’s director of undergraduate studies. This means that reducing overall spending requires slashing chunks of already small departmental operational costs.“The 15 percent is actually a much larger figure for some programs because budgets often include staff salaries, which can’t be cut,” said Maria Tatar, who chairs the folklore and mythology committee. “The real percentage could be closer to upwards of 30 percent.”Department chairs have said that they view cutting salaries as the least desirable option on the table, since staff salaries are already low.  —Staff writer Bonnie J.

The Cambridge City Council approved a rezoning measure after a contentious public meeting last night, clearing the way for six blocks of biotech labs to be constructed in East Cambridge.The Council’s decision, coming by an 8-1 vote after months of negotiations with biotech real estate developer Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc (ARE), will allow taller and denser building to exist in an area of East Cambridge previously shielded from that sort of development by its residential designation. The zoning change applies specifically to ARE and will not authorize dense construction by any other firm.Dozens of residents filled the seats in City Hall and others stood in the aisles, waiting their turn to discuss the controversial measure.Some residents attended the meeting as representatives of local unions and said that they hoped the rezoning measure would provide construction jobs that are otherwise lacking in a slow economy.“This is not only good for labor. It’s good for the City of Cambridge and it will provide much needed tax revenue,” said Joseph Power, the business representative for the Carpenters Local Union.Other residents were skeptical that the measure would bring an employment uptick.“If you’re looking at this to pay your mortgage, you’re going to be homeless and hungry,” said resident Heather M. Hoffman, addressing the union representatives present at the meeting.According to ARE Regional Vice President Tom Andrews, building labspace in East Cambridge will bring the city between $9 million and $12 million in property taxes annually.Nearly a dozen residents of East Cambridge spoke in opposition to the proposal, some holding signs that read “Too Big, Too Close, Too Toxic.” They alleged that the rezoning would allow overly tall buildings and the construction of labs handling airborne pathogens.  ARE—a Pasadena, Calif.-based company—had developed and leased 166 biotechnology labspaces in the United States and Canada as of Dec. 2008.The biotech developer began petitioning for the East Cambridge zoning change in May 2008, but is not obligated to buy any Cambridge land by yesterday’s decision.Cambridge already contains 155 biotechnology firms, marking the highest concentration of that industry in the world.The approved proposal contained a number of concessions to neighborhood and city interests. Within the six-block area opened for dense construction, ARE has agreed to maintain a minimum of 220,000 square feet of housing, including low and mixed-income housing and retail space. They have also agreed to retain 2.2 acres of open space for community use. Also part of the negotiations that preceded yesterday’s approval, the city will acquire for municipal use a building that ARE had originally bought for $14 million.—Staff writer Sarah J.

A panel of prominent scholars that included University President Drew G. Faust debated the complexities of Abraham Lincoln’s legacy before a packed audience at the Institute of Politics last night.Faust was joined by Pulitzer prize winner Tony Kushner, Harvard English professor John Stauffer, New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik, Yale University professor David W. Blight, and Gettysburg University professor Allen C. Guelzo for the discussion, which focused on the realities that underlie the Lincoln myth. Harvard professor of African-American studies Henry Louis Gates Jr. served as the moderator.“Every generation of Americans since 1865 has fashioned a Lincoln to its own needs,” said Gates, who called the event a “celebration of the 200th birthday of our 16th and greatest President.” The panelists presented varying portraits of Lincoln while debating issues ranging from Lincoln’s true role in freeing the slaves to his sexual orientation.Kushner, who is currently working on a screenplay about Lincoln’s life, took a particularly sympathetic view of the famed president.“I think he is just a tremendously moving and intriguing and wonderful presence,” Kushner said. Blight, meanwhile, discussed the many comparisons drawn between Lincoln and current president Barack Obama. “It seems to me that the ‘healer Lincoln’ is who [Obama] has really been trying to appropriate, at least publicly,” Blight said.  A recurrent theme in the discussion was the fact the enormity of the Lincoln myth tends to overshadow the efforts of the slaves themselves towards their own liberation. The event concluded with questions from the audience. Christopher A. Oland ’10 asked about Lincoln’s ability to influence others, and said he was pleased with the lengthy response he received from Guelzo.“It seemed like he had a little bit of fun with it,” ,” Oland said. “I was really glad to get this insight about how Lincoln never fully revealed himself to people.” For her part, Faust said she was glad of the opportunity to discuss Lincoln. “It was fun to talk about history, and I’m honored to be on this panel with such distinguished scholars and writers,” she said. “I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.” —Staff writer Evan T.R.

Playing in front of a sold-out crowd, at TD Banknorth Garden, in the consolation final of the 57th Beanpot,  against the defending national champions. It would have made for an intimidating environment for any goaltender to play in, not to mention one making his first collegiate start.But sophomore Ryan Carroll didn’t just make his debut as starting netminder last night. He arrived in stunning fashion, stopping 42 shots en route to a narrow 4-3 loss to the No. 15 Boston College Eagles. 
Carroll didn’t have much time to prepare for his new role in the limelight.
“I found out [on Sunday] that I’d be starting and it was just enough time, I guess,” Carroll said.
The second-year was largely responsible for the close score, singlehandedly blocking several one-on-one attempts at goal by BC. 
While leading 3-2 in the second period, an Eagle forward came streaking towards goal, leaving Harvard defenders scrambling in his wake. 
What seemed like a sure score turned into an embarrassing miss for BC as Carroll lunged forward from the goal to swipe the puck safely away from net. 
Carroll’s new role as starting goalkeeper comes after sitting on the bench all season behind freshman Matt Hoyle and junior John Riley. 
“It was kind of nice to be able to finally start a game, in the Beanpot especially,” Carroll said. “It was crazy in the first period, and then I settled in and took control of what I could.”
Carroll’s stalwart play in net anchored a strong defensive effort overall by the Crimson last night, as the penalty kill unit was successful in dismantling five of BC’s six power play opportunities. 
Despite the team’s strong defensive play, good fortune also had a hand in last night’s tight score. 
 Fortunately for the Crimson, Lady Luck was on its side, as the team managed to stay even with the Eagles despite the large disparity in shots on goal. 
On an Eagle power play late in the first period, BC forward Kyle Kucharski had a near-open shot to pop the puck in the back door. 
 Luckily for Carroll and the Crimson, the Eagle swung and completely missed the puck, allowing the teams to head into the second period with the score tied at one.PIER ONE
Playing against its third ranked opponent in as many games, the Crimson displayed its mettle by keeping the score tied until the final minute of the match. 
Though Harvard was outshot, 46-22, for the game, the team was able to stay titfor tat scorewise with BC behind the standout offensive performance of sophomore forward Pier-Olivier Michaud. 
With two goals and an assist, Michaud had a hand in all three of the Crimson’s goals last night. 
Michaud scored his first halfway through the first period on a 5-on-3 advantage, when he buried the rebound of senior defenseman Brian McCafferty’s shot on goal. 
Standing almost parallel with the goal line, Michaud somehow redirected the puck into net from a near-impossible angle.  
The sophomore also scored his second goal from a rebound as well, this time off a shot from fellow sophomore forward Matt McCollem.
Michaud was again the playmaker in the Crimson’s third and final goal of the night. Eagles goalie John Muse’s sloppy attempt to clear the puck allowed Michaud to swoop in to fire a shot on goal. Senior forward Nick Coskren buried the rebound for a short-handed tally.  
Michaud, who has found the back of the net in three of the last four games, now leads the team in scoring with six goals on the season. 
TWO-MINUTE MINORS
Even though Carroll has seen limited collegiate action, last night wasn’t the first time he has faced the Eagles. The sophomore made his collegiate debut against BC on Dec. 12 last season...Though this was the last Beanpot game for the team’s seniors, only two members of the class of 2009 came up big. Nick Coskren and Brian McCafferty each had a hand in one of last night’s goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no high like winning the ’Pot, and tonight the Crimson hopes to reclaim that sense of euphoria. 
After having smashed Boston University, 8-0, in the Beanpot’s first round, the Harvard women’s hockey team (13-7-3, 12-4-2 ECAC) is gearing up for mid-season glory in Beantown’s prestigious final tonight against No. 7 Boston College (19-7-3, 12-5-1 Hockey East). 
Faceoff is at 8 p.m. at Northeastern’s Matthews Arena. 
But will Harvard be able to leave the ghost of Beanpot past behind?
In their last meeting in the tournament, the Eagles devastated Harvard, knocking the Crimson out in the first round, 4-3, in triple-overtime. 
“I think that the game two years ago is definitely going to be in the back of our minds,” tri-captain Sarah Vaillancourt said. 
“[But] we’re going to go after it,” she added. "We want that Beanpot, we won it last year and we want to protect it. It’s ours.” 
Back then, Harvard was simply no match for BC’s then-freshman goaltender Molly Schaus, who made an NCAA-record 73 saves in the marathon game.  
“She’s a great goaltender,” Vaillancourt said.  “But I think that if we take a lot of shots, [and] then take the rebounds, then we’re definitely going to beat her. She’s not unbeatable—we’ve got to give her credit, but I’m not really worried about the goaltending that much.”  
Harvard goalie Brittany Martin still bagged a then-career-high 48 saves in the game, but her efforts paled in comparison to Schaus’ achievements. 
Schaus has since been selected for the national team, and is one of two goalies to represent the US, along with Wisconsin’s Jessie Vetter.
“We’ve got to respect her,” Vaillancourt said. “We can’t think that by shooting 20 times at the net, we’re going to win the game.  We have to go above at least 30 shots to win.” 
But goalie distinction isn’t the only trick up the Eagles’ sleeve. BC will be banking on high performance from its dynamic duo of Allie Thunstrom and Kelli Stack, who have a combined 73 points for the season.  
Stack is the reigning Hockey East Player of the Week, earning the honor by recording six points—three of which were shorthanded—in the Eagles’ last three games. BC advanced to the Beanpot championship game with a 3-1 victory over Northeastern last Tuesday.
These are not the same Eagles that Harvard pummeled, 7-0, in the teams’ only meeting last year.
“They’re in a much better position, they’ve won a lot more games, and they have a lot more confidence,” Vaillancourt said.
But the Crimson is looking forward to the challenge.
“At this point in the year, you want to play your best hockey, so you want to play against some of the best teams,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. 
The Crimson might be taking on the role of the underdog, but the team should not be underestimated. 
The squad has climbed its way out of a rough start to the season, and is now enjoying a seven-game win streak.  
Much of this success is due to a recent explosion in Harvard’s offensive play. The Crimson’s dynamite, Vaillancourt and tri-captain Jenny Brine, will be expected to maintain their recent momentum.   
The duo recorded matching hat tricks in the tournament opener last Tuesday.
And Harvard’s got the skill in net to go head-to-head with Schaus. Junior goalie Christina Kessler is coming off of one of her best weeks of the season, and was named ECAC Goaltender of the Week after shutting out BU and Brown. 
If the Crimson is successful, BC would be the highest-ranked team that Harvard has beaten this season.
A victory would certainly help the team earn a spot in the NCAA tournament. 
“We’re excited by the opportunity—[BC is] a good team,” Stone said. “They’ve got good goaltending, they’ve got a lot of skill in their team.”  
Plus, the Crimson has a not-so-secret weapon. 
Back in 2007, Eagles forward Anna McDonald scored the game-winning goal that sent Harvard home heartbroken.
Now, in 2009, McDonald wears crimson and white, and she and Harvard are hungry to defend their Beanpot title.
“Every game means a lot to us, but certainly we want to have that Beanpot in Cambridge at the end of Tuesday night,” Stone said.  “So we’ll be ready to go, focused, as I’m sure they will be too, and it’s going to be a great hockey game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The reigning women’s hockey player of the year will not be denied.  
Sarah Vaillancourt, Harvard’s tri-captain and the 2008 Patty Kazmaier Award winner, proved once again this week why she is among the nation’s top forwards. But she doesn’t let her success get to her head. 
“I’m the same player, I’m doing the same thing,” Vaillancourt said. “If you’ve seen me play, I just work my hardest every time, and sometimes it goes in the net.”
She kicked the week off by securing a stunning seven points against Boston University last Tuesday at the Beanpot, leading Harvard to an 8-0 thrashing of the Terriers. Vaillancourt scored a hat trick and bagged four assists, leaving no doubt about her scoring and playmaking abilities.  
She followed up that primetime performance with a terrific weekend. 
Against Yale, Vaillancourt set up two of her teammates in a close 2-1 contest. But the margin of victory was widened against Brown on Saturday, when Vaillancourt scored two goals and added two more assists to her weekend tally. 
Harvard’s 4-0 win over Brown capped an impressive week for the Quebec native, who had a hand in 13 of Harvard’s 14 goals in the last three games.  
Vaillancourt has tallied 16 goals and 20 assists thus far, leading the team in points with 36. The senior forward has also accumulated 221 points in her career, seventh all-time on the Crimson’s scoring list. 
Harvard’s high-powered offense will go into the Beanpot tonight with the resolve to add one more piece of hardware to its prestigious tradition. 
The Crimson’s recent success has come along with better team play, which in turn leads to a greater contribution by Vaillancourt.  
“I think that every kid on our team is very determined right now,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They know what the stakes are, they’re all playing harder and smarter, and they’re sharing the puck.  That gives [Vaillancourt] the opportunity to do the things she does well. So many of the goals that have been scored in the past week have been because of our speed, everybody working together—not just one individual effort.  Sometimes it appears that way, but it’s [about] people being a threat, making a lot more space for someone like Sarah.” 
Harvard and Vaillancourt’s tenacity will be tested against Boston College in the Beanpot final, though this will not be the first time Vaillancourt has faced the pressures of a championship game. 
She was the second-youngest member of the Canadian women’s hockey team that captured Olympic gold in Turin three years ago, and as a freshman she scored a goal and had an assist for Harvard in the NCAA championship game against Minnesota. 
The last couple of years have been full of accolades, the most important one coming at the end of last season, when she received the Kazmaier Award as the nation’s best player. 
She netted 26 goals and had 36 assists last year, and was named to numerous all-league squads.
Vaillancourt claims she hasn’t changed her ways this time around. 
“I was struggling with putting pucks in the net at the beginning of the season, but now it’s going in,” she said. “Everyone else [on the] team is getting open, and I think the lines are really clicking together right now, and I think that’s where the success is coming from...I think we’re in a pretty good position right now.” 
Not only is Harvard in prime position to make it back into the national rankings, but Vaillancourt has also boosted her statistics to keep pace with the nation's leaders, solidifying her position among the top candidates for this year’s Kazmaier Award. 
Her chance to win this year’s highest prize improved with a 13-point performance this past week, a third of the points she has acquired this season. 
She is also currently third in the nation with 2.00 points per game, and was named ECAC Player of the Week for her efforts.
With Vaillancourt hot and the team playing at a high intensity, Harvard is poised to finish the regular season strong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team began league play by suffering a tough 3-2 (30-26, 30-28, 22-30, 22-30, 15-11) loss to NYU on Friday. The very next day, however, it found itself on the winning side of the net with a 3-2 (26-30, 30-28, 24-30, 30-26, 15-13) victory over East Stroudsburg. And though it was a bittersweet weekend for the Crimson (2-2, 1-1 Hay Division), the relatively young group at times played like a veteran team.HARVARD 3, EAST STROUDSBURG 2Despite being down, 2-1, after three games, the Crimson made just enough plays to ensure a victory against East Stroudsburg. “I think that we learned a lot from yesterday’s loss,” freshman Matt Jones said. “Playing in that five-game match [against NYU] really set us well to play in Saturday’s match, which also went to five games.”The team worked on improving its passing game. “Coach [Brian] Baise wanted our passing to be more consistent, so that we could run a better, offense with more options,” Jones said. “Brady [Weissbourd] is our middle captain, and we wanted to set him up as much as possible.”The Crimson managed to get the ball to its co-captain Weissbourd, who continued to display senior leadership, contributing 15 kills, six digs and six blocks in the winning effort. Rookie Nikola Ivica and Jones combined for 32 kills, while junior Erik Kuld put up consistent numbers of 16 kills and 15 blocks.Harvard was able to come back from behind in the fourth set courtesy of Kuld’s three-straight kills which gave the Crimson a three-point advantage. However, the Warriors would not relent. Led by Jon Daley’s match-high 22 kills, ESU traded point-for-point and closed in by cutting the lead to 26-29 until Weissbourd ended the game with a resounding kill. “Our coaches said that Daley would be their best player,” Jones said. “We needed to block up on him. Our defense really focused on him.” In the final game of the match, Harvard appeared to pull away from East Stroudsburg, as kills by Kuld and Weissbourd put the Crimson one point away from victory. Just two plays later, Jones sealed the victory with a kill and gave Baise his second victory in his first season as Harvard’s coach.NYU 3, HARVARD 2A rowdy and enthusiastic crowd showed up for Friday afternoon’s showdown between the two teams.In its first game against NYU, Harvard relied on a variety of serves and good blocks from its front line to squeeze out a 30-26 win. From the get-go, Weissbourd and Ivica used their size advantage to fuel the Crimson’s offensive firepower with 14 and 13 kills, respectively, in the game. Jones also impressed, contributing 14 kills and one block. “From day one, the freshmen have come in and been a really important part of our team,” Baise said. “They’re a big part of our offense and defense and they’re handling a big portion of our passing, which is hard, especially for freshman. They played with a lot of maturity and blocked extremely well.”While Harvard registered 13 kills in the first game, it also committed 12 errors, the majority coming from net violations and service errors. This would prove to be the Crimson’s achilles’ heel throughout the entire match. In the second game, Harvard found itself falling behind 16-21 before a tip by Jones—following a spectacular save by Ivica—ignited a rally by the Crimson. The freshmen duo of Ivica and Jones continued to make plays, and Harvard would fight back to a tie at 28-28 before putting the Violets away 30-28. Though NYU was down, 2-0, the momentum of the game would shift for good in the third game. “I didn’t think there was going to be a momentum change at the time,” Baise said. “We played well the first two games, but they just kept getting to us throughout the match.”The Violets, led by junior Michael Ferragonio and senior Devin Zolnowski’s combined 36 kills, found its hitting rhythm, registering team attack percentages of .133, .185, and a jaw-dropping .667 in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th games. Meanwhile, the Crimson’s team attack would go downhill, hitting a low of .000 in the fourth game to go along with ten errors and only ten kills. “We had a hard time getting the ball to the guys we wanted to,” Baise said. “We made a few too many errors. NYU really tightened up and we didn’t.” Overall, Harvard would commit 11 more errors and register 12 fewer blocks than its opponent.“It was definitely a tough loss to NYU,” Jones said. “It was a league game that we really felt that we definitely needed to win.”—Staff writer Kevin T.
