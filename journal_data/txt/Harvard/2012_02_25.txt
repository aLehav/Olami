After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a Republican nominating contest that has been marked by fiery debate performances, Tuesday’s debate, the twentieth and final such event, underwhelmed. No candidate delivered a memorable performance, and the debate lacked the fire that helped resuscitate some campaigns—think Newt Gingrich in South Carolina, for example—or flubs that sank others—think Rick Perry’s “oops” moment.
With the floodgates opened on so-called super PAC spending, this nominating cycle has seen an unusual level of menacing attack ads. But the unprecedented number of debates has offered voters an important chance to view their candidates in a (relatively) unscripted situation. Voters have responded in kind, and this year’s debates have received record ratings. So in a race that was supposed to be Mitt Romney’s for the taking, the debates have offered a leveling effect and have contributed to the race’s longevity. Newt Gingrich’s fiery debate performances in South Carolina, for example, were widely credited with his victory in that state, which played no small part in helping his candidacy limp forward.
So if the Republican debates have helped define the race, what impact does Tuesday’s debate have on the remainder of the contest?
Most observers have argued that Romney has the momentum going into next Tuesday’s primaries in Arizona and Michigan, but this week’s debate occurred against the backdrop of a national surge by Rick Santorum, who now has a slim lead in national polls. But Santorum failed to deliver a knock out blow on Tuesday, offering a convoluted response on Congressional ear marks and a rigmarole explanation of why he had chosen to endorse Arlen Spector over Patrick J. Toomey, Sr., his conservative rival, in the 2006 Senate election in his home state of Pennsylvania.
Romney, meanwhile, acquitted himself just well enough and offered a disciplined performance that saw him deliver a few effective jabs at Santorum over his Congressional voting record. To Santorum’s chagrin, Ron Paul continued to play the part of Romney’s unlikely attack dog. Paul delivered the night’s most memorable line when asked by CNN’s John King why he had chosen to air an ad describing Santorum as a fake. “Because he is a fake,” Paul said, grinning. On a set that resembled a set of school desks, Paul looked like the class prankster who had just made a fool of his teacher and got the entire class to laugh along with him. The only thing missing from Santorum’s embarrassed teacher get-up was his sweater vest. Paul continued to play that role throughout the evening, and Santorum could do little but look on in astonishment as the boyish Constitutionalist ran circles around him.
The issues discussed in Tuesday’s debate, however, did little to set up the Republican candidates for the upcoming contests. The economic portion of Tuesday’s debate was dominated by a discussion over the federal deficit. Jobs seemed to take a backseat as the candidates bickered over one another’s budget-cutting credentials. That did not do the candidates any favors as they head into contests in Michigan and Arizona on Tuesday, which boast a 9.3 and 8.7 percent unemployment rate, respectively.
With the debate being held in Mesa, AZ, there was plenty of red meat served on the immigration question. But no candidate distinguished themselves on the issue, and the debate was a wash on this point as well.
When the debate shifted to social issues, Santorum owned the stage, but Romney turned in an acceptable performance on this point as well. Mystifyingly, no candidate brought up Romney’s shifting position on abortion, and Romney managed to escape unharmed on an issue that many Conservatives have doubted his credibility.
On the Middle East, Romney presented himself as the most statesman-like of the bunch as Santorum continued to pound his steady drumbeat for a war against Iran. Gingrich offered a blistering argument in favor of intervening in Iran, bringing up the historical backdrop of the Holocaust to explain Israeli thinking about an Iranian nuclear bomb. But the moment was an exception in his overall performance, which lacked the fire of his previous performances. As Slate’s John F. Dickerson wryly noted, “he sounded like a man who will make mountains of money on the lecture circuit.”
With no defining narrative emerging out of Tuesday’s debate, the time is long past to start looking long and hard at the delegate math of this year’s primary. Romney currently has the lead in delegates, but that lead does not amount to much at this point—only 12 percent of delegates have been divvied up. After Super Tuesday on March 6, 34 percent of delegates will have been decided. While those contests offer the opportunity for a candidate to deliver a knock out blow, polling data indicates that much of the race remains up in the air.
Of the upcoming contests, swing states Michigan and Ohio will be most closely watched. In Michigan, the race is currently in a dead heat. In Ohio, Santorum has the edge. On March 3, in a prelude to Super Tuesday, Washington will hold its GOP caucus, and according to the latest Public Policy Poll, Santorum has an 11 point lead in that state.
But given the state of the race, Super Tuesday appears unlikely to settle the affair. Georgia, which with 76 delegates is the largest state to go to the polls that day, is in a statistical tie according to the latest local poll. However, Mike Huckabee’s win there in 2008 should give hope to Santorum who appeals to a similarly minded religious electorate. Massachusetts, with 41 delegates, will likely go to Romney. In Idaho, with 32 delegates, the state’s significant Mormon population should give Romney a boost, though, according to media reports, Santorum has been generating some buzz in the state in recent weeks. But it is important to note that many of these primaries are proportional, so even if one candidate racks up a series of wins, a challenger could easily limp along and keep accumulating delegates in the hope of staging a late upset in a large state like Texas or California, both of which vote late in the calendar.
While the specter of a brokered convention seems ludicrous, if the candidates continue to amass delegates at about the same pace as they are currently doing, that dream may very well become a reality.
So with the race in flux, the fact that no narrative emerged out of Tuesday’s debate only reflects the state of the Republican nominating process, which now appears headed toward an extended fight not unlike the 2008 Democratic primary. And Tuesday’s debate only exacerbated this problem for all three candidates, as no one was able to craft a moment off of which they could pivot into Super Tuesday.
But is there any way one can find a winner in this mess? Yes—Barack Obama, who can only be watching with glee as his would be opponents destroy one another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just one point out of fourth place coming into this weekend’s action, the final two games left of the regular season, the Harvard men’s hockey team had a shot to earn a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs.
And the Crimson took an important step in making that goal a reality on Friday night, topping St. Lawrence, 4-1, at Bright Hockey Center.
Junior forward David Valek’s two goals sparked the Crimson attack while sophomore goaltender Raphael Girard had a standout night between the pipes, stopping 31 of the 32 Saints (13-17-3, 9-11-1 ECAC) shots.
“I don’t think it was the best executed game in a while, but I thought we really stepped up and made some plays when we had to,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “And obviously, our goaltending was the difference.
And with fourth-place Clarkson’s loss to Dartmouth, the Crimson (9-8-11, 7-5-9 ECAC) is now tied for third place and controls its own fate. A Colgate loss or a win or a tie Saturday against the Golden Knights would earn Harvard the coveted bye.
The victory also clinched home ice for the Crimson in its first round of playoff action.
Offensively, along with Valek, junior defenseman Danny Biega also tallied two points, though his came on two assists, the 21st and 22nd of the season for the blueliner.
On the defensive side, Girard turned in what was perhaps his best performance of the year, including a number of key saves on St. Lawrence power plays to keep the Crimson ahead.
“Raph was phenomenal,” Valek said. “It wasn’t just the [number of saves]; it was the types of saves. On the penalty kill, he was our biggest star of the game…. He couldn’t have done anything else to help us out.”
After Harvard committed 15 penalties in the team’s 7-1 loss to Yale six days prior, captain defenseman Ryan Grimshaw was whistled for contact to the head just 1:12 into the contest, earning a game misconduct.
Despite a flurry of St. Lawrence shots, the Crimson looked well on its way to killing the man advantage, but with just three seconds left on the five-minute power play, the Saints broke the deadlock. From the right circle, St. Lawrence’s Greg Carey found teammate Austin Riley, who knocked the shot past Girard to give the visiting St. Lawrence the early lead.
“I think we did a great job the first four minutes, 57 seconds,” Valek said. “Everybody was pumped up on the bench. Obviously, to kill off a five minute doesn’t happen often….Even though we gave up the goal, we got a lot of momentum off of that.”
That momentum paid dividends just 65 seconds later. Freshman defenseman Max Everson, from the right point, passed along the blue line to Biega. The junior launched the puck towards goal, and Valek tipped it past Saints netminder Matt Weninger for the equalizer.
“[After that goal], we felt, ‘Hey, we’ve already killed off a five-minute penalty, and we’ve been able to even up the game,’” Donato said. “And so we were able to right the ship a little bit.”
The Crimson continued to right the ship later in the period, striking again with 4:21 left. After a Saints defender nearly tipped it into his own goal, the puck fell right to senior forward Eric Krohus. The senior maneuvered past the goal line before depositing the puck in the back of the net, giving Harvard a lead it did not relinquish for the rest of the game.
Despite soundly outshooting the Crimson in the first frame, 13-8, the Saints failed to muster another score in the opening 20 minutes of action.
The same pattern emerged in the second period, as St. Lawrence’s 14 shots to Harvard’s eight once again put the Crimson on its heels. But the Harvard defense bent but did not break, helping Harvard preserve the tenuous lead entering the final period of play.
Girard was critical in keeping the visitors scoreless in the second, and the success helped feed into his confidence. At one point, after making a key stop, Girard took the puck and casually tossed it to an opposing player.
“I don’t do that all the time, but when things are going your way, it rattles them even more,” Girard said. “I’m not really cocky, but sometimes, when things are going your way, you might be pretty cocky. Patrick Roy was one of the cockiest goalies, and he was one of the best in history.”
In two of the Crimson’s previous four contests, one-goal leads vanished in the third period, turning wins into ties. But on Friday, Harvard bucked that trend as Valek scored his second of the night, beating Weninger 6:41 into the frame.
Coupled with a two-goal deficit, the Saints attack lost its edge in the final period, tallying just five shots in the final 20 minutes compared to Harvard’s 11.
“We started slow in the first and the second [periods],” Girard said. “The guys came out to play in the third. We came out to win instead of hanging on to the game.”
A Crimson goal on an empty Saints net with 34 seconds left on the clock sealed the Harvard victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five minutes into the third period, the Harvard women’s hockey team found itself in a much different position against Princeton than the last time it took on the Tigers. Unlike the teams’ two previous matchup, when the Crimson dominated the Tigers, 10-1, Harvard found itself in the midst of a 3-3 tie.
But for the second weekend in a row, sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry provided the offensive spark as Harvard (21-8-1, 17-4-1 ECAC) survived a late Princeton (12-14-4, 10-10-2) comeback to take a 1-0 lead in the ECAC quarterfinals series.
Fry registered her second consecutive hat trick, giving Harvard a much-needed boost to fend off the surging Tigers.
And it was Fry who put the Crimson up early, as a pass from junior forward Jillian Dempsey from the left fell through several Harvard and Princeton players before finding Fry. The sophomore picked up the loose puck and drew out Tiger goalkeeper Rachel Weber before moving left and slotting behind Weber for the opening goal.
Both offenses kept their opposing goalkeepers busy early on, increasing the physicality of the game.
Soon the Crimson doubled its lead, as freshman forward Samantha Reber found classmate defender Sarah Edney along the blue line. Edney laid the puck off for junior assistant captain Josephine Pucci, whose slap shot just slipped past Weber’s right shoulder.
But entering the second period, Princeton turned it up, controlling possession for long spells and peppering junior goalkeeper Laura Bellamy from distance.
And after eight minutes, the Tigers’ persistence paid off, as a Princeton shot rebounded off Bellamy to sophomore Denna Laing. The forward banged it past Bellamy to cut the deficit.
Though the Tigers began to gain momentum, Fry once again showed her offensive prowess on her second goal.
Picking up the puck in the neutral zone, Fry blew by a defender on the left, cut across the face of goal, and drew Weber out of her goal. The forward waited for her moment and then fired the puck home to restore the Crimson’s two-goal cushion.
And despite the squad’s lead, Harvard coach Katey Stone voiced concerns over its performance in the period.
“The second period was scattered and erratic for us,” Stone said. “We have got to clean some things up.”
And with the third period underway, Stone received more evidence of needed improvement, as Princeton brought itself level with two goals in the opening minutes.
After pressuring the Crimson defense, Laing found the puck at the slot and launched a shot past Bellamy for her second on the night. Three minutes later, as a Harvard power play ended, an errant pass from the Crimson allowed the Tigers to put on the offensive pressure. Brianna Leahy took advantage, firing a shot into the net that evened the score.
“The first shift [of the third period] didn’t go how we wanted it to go,” Fry said. “It kind of went downhill from there, and they popped in a few goals. We told ourselves we needed to step on the gas, or something bad was going to happen.”
After 10 minutes of scoreless action, Fry was there to give Harvard a spark.
A clear from Pucci forced the Princeton defense back, but a slip by Tiger freshman Ali Pankowski gave the puck to Reber, who found Fry in front of the goal. The sophomore shot past Weber, giving her a hat trick and her team the lead.
“She is doing great,” Stone said of Fry, who after Friday’s contest had scored eight of the Crimson’s previous 10 goals. “That line is playing well, and she is getting open, and they are making a lot of things happen. She seems to be in the right place at the right time, and she has great patience with the puck.”
With time running out, Princeton pressed forward, pulling its goalie out for the final minute. But a Harvard clearance found sophomore Gina McDonald in the neutral area, who scored an empty net goal on the breakaway to ice the game and give the team a 1-0 lead heading into Saturday’s contest.
“We just have to get back to the basics,” Stone said after Friday’s match. “When we did that in the first period, we had a lot of success. We got away from it in the second period and things started to wear on us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yet another Harvard-Princeton basketball game came down to the wire on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion.
But unlike in the last two meetings between the rivals, it was the Crimson (24-3, 10-1 Ivy) who emerged victorious, completing a late second-half rally to pull out a thrilling 67-64 win.
With the victory, Harvard avenged its loss earlier in the season to the Tigers (15-11, 6-4) and kept itself in control of its own destiny in the Ivy League race.
Junior forward Kyle Casey led the Crimson with 20 points and eight rebounds while classmate Brandyn Curry added 15 points and six assists in a game dominated by streaks.
“There was a little more to this win for us, a little something personal,” Casey said. “We had to throw everything into it tonight to pull it out. Princeton really came in and played well.... It was a really gutsy effort by everyone.”
Curry’s three from the right wing gave Harvard the lead at 57-55 with 6:54 to go, and after Doug Davis missed a chance to answer at the other end, a Curry jumper gave the Crimson a four-point advantage with five minutes left.
“I was just trying to be aggressive,” Curry said. “In the second half, [it is] crunch time, [and] as the quarterback of this team, I’ve just got to make plays.... Whatever the team asks me to do to win, I’m going to do it.”
Neither team scored for the following three minutes until a free throw by Princeton’s T.J. Bray cut the deficit to three. On the Tigers’ next possession, Davis missed a long ball, but Patrick Saunders grabbed the offensive rebound and found Davis, who drove and hit a runner off the backboard to make it 59-58 with 53 seconds to go.
On Harvard’s next possession, Casey used a pump fake to draw a foul and hit both free throws. Out of a timeout, Tigers forward Ian Hummer couldn’t finish over Casey, and co-captain Oliver McNally snagged the rebound and calmly hit his ensuing two foul shots to extend the lead to five.
Bray hit a desperation fall-back three with 10 seconds left, and Harvard again got it to McNally, its best free-throw shooter, off the inbounds. After being fouled, the senior sank both again, and Davis lost the ball sprinting up the court on Princeton’s next possession.
McNally then hit two more from the charity stripe to seal the dramatic win before a Davis heave at the buzzer went in to make it a 67-64 final.
“I thought we dug in,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “That’s something I’m incredibly pleased and proud of. We gave great energy and effort to come back.”
The Crimson started the game on a 7-0 run following a Casey jumper, a top-of-the key Casey three, and a Curry driving layup.
But Princeton responded and cut Harvard’s to 11-10 on a Davis long ball before Harvard scored five straight. Two Saunders threes knotted the game at 18, and from there Princeton went on a 15-5 run capped by a Hummer floater over two defenders to open up a 33-23 advantage with 3:59 to go in the first half.
But the Crimson would rally before the break, finishing on a 9-0 spurt of its own capped by a Curry left wing three and a McNally transition layup to make it 33-32 going into the half.
“I thought the way we closed the first half was as big as anything,” Amaker said. “It gave us momentum to stay in the game and scratch and claw in the second half.”
Early in the second, Princeton extended its lead to seven with a 6-0 run on jumpers by Davis, Brendan Connolly, and Hummer.
But the Crimson answered with six straight of its own on a Casey driving layup, a Laurent Rivard transition runner off a Curry steal, and a long Casey jumper to make it 39-38.
“It was a game we had to win, and when you have to win, people have to step up,” Casey said. “I was kind of feeling it, and my shots were falling tonight, so it was just my night.”
The Tigers pushed the lead back to six on a Denton Koon three and a Bray layup with 14:16 to go, and the Princeton lead grew to as large as seven at 50-43 moments later.
But from there, Steve Moundou-Missi and Curry hit driving layups—the latter an and-one—to cut it to two. Bray turned it over on the next Tiger possession, and Wright was fouled going up for a dunk at the other end as Lavietes reached its loudest point.
The co-captain hit both free throws to tie the game and then tipped in a Wes Saunders miss on the next Crimson possession to give Harvard back the lead—its first since midway through the opening half—at 52-50 with 9:29 left.
Princeton’s Mack Darrow, Wright, and Hummer traded baskets—Hummer’s an and-one—to give the Tigers a one-point advantage at 55-54 with 8:17 to go in the back-and-forth contest.
But the Crimson held Princeton scoreless for the following six minutes as Harvard retook the lead on Curry’s three.
“I didn’t think we played them very well defensively [last meeting] at Princeton,” Amaker said. “We were hoping we could redeem ourselves on the defensive end.”
The victory set a program record for wins in a season, with 24, and put the Crimson in position to clinch a share of the Ivy title for the second straight season if it can beat Penn at home tomorrow night.
“[The turnaround] is incredibly challenging, no doubt about it,” Amaker said. “[But] we’ll recover, and we’ll be ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three weeks ago, nobody would have imagined this. But after dazzLINg fans at the world’s most famous arena, a Harvard grad played his way onto the national spotlight during all-star weekend.
With basketball fandom’s attention turned to one game, the stage was set for Jeremy Lin ’ 10 to take on the NBA’s most promising talents in Friday night’s BBVA Rising Star Challenge.
The event that traditionally pits rookies against sophomores got a new look this year, as the NBA decided to change to a draft format. Team Shaq’s Lin, drafted third overall, was unable to find his groove in the 9 p.m EST start in Orlando’s Amway Center.
Lin did not get the time he is used to of late, in part due to the fact that Team Shaq carried five point guards on the roster. In his nine minutes, he scored two points, registered an assist and committed a turnover.
Coming off two 30-minute games on back-to-back nights, the reduced time was a welcomed break for the sophomore. But the news wasn’t all bad for the Knicks. Landry Fields, the sophomore out of Stanford, had a productive night for Team Shaq. He went 8-12 from the floor in 18 minutes of play.
Despite the reduced role, Lin could not escape the media. Late in the fourth quarter, Marv Albert approached Lin about his darling status. During the conversation, Lin revealed he and Shumpert’s botched dunk contest plans. Shumpert, who will be held out of the contest with a knee injury, would have attempted a windmill over a couch on the ball.

Whether it's the demonic hound haunting Baskerville manor, or the Swamp Adder lurking in the Stoner household, stories involving detective Sherlock Holmes rarely fail to capture the imagination of their audiences—especially when they leap off the pages and on to Harvard's campus.
Over the past two weeks, residents of the Quad have noticed a change in their familiar landscape: around five chalk graffiti messages, reading "I believe in Sherlock Holmes," and "Moriarty was real," have popped up on buildings and fences. One of the most prominent notes appears on an outside wall of Pforzheimer House, next to the shuttle stop.
Fans of the BBC hit "Sherlock" will recognize that the text is inspired by the climactic finale to the show's second season.
The two Harvard students responsible for the graffiti have chosen to remain anonymous to protect their relationships with administrators and refer to themselves simply as "The Goth Detectives"—an ode to English comedians Russell Brand and Noel Fielding, they explained. The duo said they were astonished at just how many people have noticed their work and understood its reference.
They were also pleased to see such a positive response from the Harvard student body, and reported having seen other spin-off chalk messages around campus. The pieces have shown resilience against nature's elements and campus authorities; so far only one of the pieces has been removed.
The motivation behind their work was a response to two things they felt Harvard is lacking: "Harvard needs more radical chalk graffiti," said one member of the pair. "And more shenanigans," added the second.
Sherlock provided a way to achieve both.
The Sherlock Holmes phenomenon, however, extends far beyond the gates of Harvard's campus; similar "I believe in Sherlock Holmes" tags have been popping up all over the country.
This blog documents the tags as they appear and this map gives an idea of just how widespread the phenomenon is.

Ben & Jerry's in Harvard Square is showing its Linthusiasm with a new frozen yogurt flavor, "Taste the Lin-Sanity". Ordering it comes with a cute gimmick: shoot a basketball, and if you make the basket, you get a $1 discount on the froyo.
What's inside, though, is less benign. The original frozen yogurt contained honey lychee swirls and fortune cookie pieces, according to manager Ryan Midden in an interview with the Boston Globe.
The lychee and fortune cookies are a clear allusion to the ethnicity of Jeremy Lin '10—an interesting choice, considering that fortune cookies themselves were only popularized in America and are virtually unknown within China.
The fortune cookie pieces have since been swapped out for a waffle cookie on the side, primarily "because the cookies got so soggy," Midden told the Globe.
Ben & Jerry's has flavors inspired by other celebrities as well. The Stephen Colbert Americone Dream includes fudge-covered waffle cone pieces with a caramel swirl. Jimmy Fallon's Late Night Snack has fudge covered potato chip clusters and a salty caramel swirl.
Lintrigued? Head to the Garage to try out the flavor soon, so the Linsanity doesn't pass you by.

It's a universal fact that great athletes share two qualities: talent and a nice head of hair. Jeremy Lin is no exception.
Today, this Flyby correspondent discovered the man behind Lin's haircut: a middle-aged Chinese gentleman named Jimmy who works in a Mountain View hair salon near Palo Alto, California.
According to the owners, Lin and his two brothers all frequented the barbershop as kids and young adults growing up in California. Last year, when Lin was playing for the Golden State Warriors, he stopped by again and Jimmy was keen enough to snap a picture with the soon-to-be famous althete-cum-celebrity. Shortly after the breakout of Linsanity, the owners had the photo framed and hung on their wall.
For all you die-hard Lin fans out there, if you're ever in the Bay Area and in dire need of a haircut, you can check out Elegance Hair Salon in downtown Mountain View.
