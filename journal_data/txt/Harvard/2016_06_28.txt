After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a warm Sunday, Cantabrigians celebrated the reopening of the grassy Cambridge Common park, marking the completion of a construction project that had been in the works for more than 15 years.
More than 40 people gathered to see the newly renovated Common, one of the city’s major parks situated on Massachusetts Avenue across from Harvard Yard. The renovation project planted more than 120 trees in the Common, in addition to installing LED lights, a water fountain, bicycle racks, and benches.
“This is a really special day for us,” Cambridge City Manager Richard C. Rossi said. “We’ve been really trying to get this project funded and completed since the early 1990s.”
The project required more than $6 million in funding to complete, from sources including state and federal transportation funds, according to the program for the park’s opening celebration. 
“It’s a real thrill to see it all come to fruition now,” Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq said during the celebration.
Massachusetts Department of Transportation secretary and CEO Stephanie Pollack emphasized the transportation implications for the new Common, saying that the space would allow people to travel through Cambridge more efficiently. The department helped to fund the construction project.
“Thinking comprehensively about how people get around… is a big part of [the department’s] mission,” Pollack said.
More than 10,000 people travel in or around Cambridge Common each day, according to Rossi.
State Representative Marjorie C. Decker also praised the “important safety additions” that came during the construction, such as the two-way path for bikers and pedestrians that was added to the adjacent Flagstaff Park.
“It’s great to have [the Common] renovated,” Cambridge Vice Mayor Marc McGovern said. “It’s great to have it continue to be a place where people can gather, and share ideas, and walk through and enjoy the space in a city that’s ever becoming more dense and crowded.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will offer a class in American Sign Language for the first time in more than 20 years, following advocacy from students and instructors from across the University.
But because the course does not include a writing component, it will not count for a student’s foreign language requirement, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences policy. The course, offered in FAS, will be available to undergraduate and graduate students, and for cross-registration.
Andrew R. Bottoms, an instructor of literacy and language education at Boston University, will teach the course, which, for at least the next year, will be capped at 15 students. Bottoms  currently teaches in Boston University’s deaf studies program, a  curriculum in American sign language and deaf culture that Bottoms helped developed.
“I wanted to set Harvard on the right course,” Bottoms said. “And what I want is for those classes to continue, to flourish, because I know there’s a lot of demand for it across the country.”
The University has been slow to re-adopt ASL compared to peer institutions after it abandoned the program in 1994, citing financial difficulties. According to a recent study commissioned by the Modern Language Association, as of 2013 ASL is the third most-enrolled language, besides English, in colleges across the nation.
After Harvard’s original ASL course dissolved in 1994, students sought other avenues to pursue their interest in the language. The Committee on Deaf Awareness currently offers extracurricular course offerings of ASL on Sundays through the Phillips Brooks House Association, though the infrequency of the course makes it difficult for students to grasp the nuances of the language, Emily G. Davies ’18 —the University Initiatives Coordinator for the Committee on Deaf Awareness said.
Bottoms, who said he was previously unaware of these courses, said he is happy the additional courses exist, and that he intends to serve as a resource for students pursuing further knowledge in deaf studies. He stressed, however, that the informal courses must combine an introduction to ASL and an education in deaf culture to be truly effective.
“That’s necessary if you want to understand deaf people in the community, if you want to understand the history and culture of deaf people,” Bottoms said. “If the university focuses on ASL courses in the absence of deaf studies courses, then students won’t understand or gain a respect or understanding of the deaf community.”
Over the last few years, people advocating for the resurgence of the course at Harvard have intensified their efforts. In 2014, a referendum calling for the Undergraduate Council to formally support the campaign for ASL courses was added to the spring voting cycle after more than 700 students signed a petition to get it on the ballot.
Voters overwhelmingly supported the referendum, but because of the low turnout at the vote—only 18.5 percent of undergraduates participated—the UC did not back the referendum until a subsequent vote, where the council unanimously supported the reintroduction of the classes.
Davies was one of the leading advocates of the course. Last fall, she approached assistant professor of linguistics Kathryn Davidson to sponsor the course at the faculty level.
“Because it’s a new course, it has to be supported by a professor,” Davies said. “When I found that I wasn’t able to help from a student’s perspective anymore—especially when you’re figuring out the logistics of trying to find a new professor—they [Harvard] didn’t want student input at that point, and Professor Davidson was extremely helpful with that.”
When a colleague told Bottoms Harvard was looking for an instructor for the course, Bottoms said he jumped on the opportunity.
Bottoms said that his goal is for students to learn to use ASL as naturally as they might their native language, both in and outside of  the classroom.
“These students are essentially in their infancy, and I want to give them natural stimulation so that they can incorporate the language naturally and, before they know it, become conversant in the language without thinking about it,” Bottoms said.
Davidson and Bottoms expect demand for the course to exceed the class’s capacity, and hope expand it in the future.
“This ASL course sequence this year is a trial, so right now we can't guarantee that it will happen every year in the future,” Davidson said. “But if it goes well and there is continued interest by students, there are many possibilities for more ASL at Harvard. Professor Bottoms and I would love to see that happen.”

Okay, we relent. Harvard is amazing during the summertime. The yard looks beautiful (even though every inch of it is covered with tourists), and the houses look resplendent with all of their trees in bloom and their gardens and courtyards soaked in afternoon sunlight. But as great as Harvard looks during the summer, Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville look even better; the towns truly come alive during the summer.
So what does that mean for you? It means that it’s time to stop instagramming Harvard buildings and venture beyond the bubble. With the Fourth of July on the horizon, Boston organizations are gearing up for one of the most event-packed weekends of the summer. Check out these cool events happening throughout the greater Boston area.
Harvard Farmers MarketTuesday at noon | Science Center Plaza
The Science Center might be going through renovations, but the Science Center Plaza is still busy. Every Tuesday, vendors from across the city come and gather under the Science Center tent for Harvard’s weekly farmers market, featuring fresh fruit, jam, and our personal favorite: apple cider. Even if you’re living all the way out in the Quad, you should make your way over to the Farmer’s Market for some fresh, healthy food. After all, you can only eat so many nachos before your body starts to wilt due to malnutrition.
Grown Up StoryTime with BooTownWednesday at 7 p.m. | 14 Tyler St., Somerville
Not those kind of grown up stories. Ew. No, remember when your parents used to read you stories before bed? This is sort of like that, but instead of cookies and milk, you can plop down with a nice can of beer and your closest friends at this event hosted by BooTown Boston. It works like this: the organization collect hilarious, heartwarming, and downright outrageous short stories ahead of the event, and then invites artists and performers from around the area to read them aloud. Check out the event at Aeronaut Brewing Company’s stage. The event is pay-what-you-can, though the organizers suggest that you bring $5 per person so that they can pay their artists. It’s a fun, alternative way to enjoy yourself during the evening, and a great way to get away from campus without breaking your bank.
Movie Night at Fenway ParkWednesday at 7 p.m. | Fenway Park
Depending on how old you are, you may or may not be aware that Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is one of the best movies to ever grace the big screen. Fenway Park is helping Boston celebrate the movie’s 30th anniversary (sorry if that just made you feel old, 80’s kids) on Wednesday with a movie night at the stadium. The usual Fenway Park fan fare—food, gear, and beer— will be available. General admissions tickets are $10 for adults and $5 for children 12 and under. Keep an eye out on the weather because the movie will run rain or shine. Gates open at 7 p.m., and the movie starts around 8:15 p.m.
T: an MBTA MusicalFriday at 10 p.m. | 255 Elm St., Somerville
If you’ve ever been royally pissed at the T, and all of the rest of MBTA’s public transportation, then this musical is perfect for you. Hosted at the Davis Square Theater, the musical is a quirky telling of twenty-somethings and their attempts to circumvent the screwed up machinations of Boston’s premier transportation agency. The price is a little steep ($25), but it’ll be a hilarious way to kick off a weekend, and will put you smack-dab in the center of one of Boston’s most culturally thriving squares.
Boston HarborfestJuly 1 - 4 | Boston
Boston Harborfest is one Boston’s annual Fourth of July traditions. The opening ceremony starts on Friday with the 215th Army Band kicking off the celebration at Faneuil Hall at noon. Later that evening, you can enjoy live entertainment and a movie screening at Columbus Park around 6 p.m. Check out the event's website for a full rundown of all of the 100+ activities and events running throughout the weekend.

Home to scholars, artists, and even A-listers, Harvard Business School has accepted five-time Grand Slam winner and one of the highest paid female athletes, tennis player Maria Sharapova.
You may think this means you have found a new doubles partner or even a new yoga buddy, but unfortunately Sharapova will only be at Harvard for a two week summer program.
It may seem odd that a world-class athlete can spare the time to attend Harvard, even if only for a couple weeks, but earlier this year, Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, a recently banned substance, and received a two-year suspension from the International Tennis Federation. Sharapova is appealing the case, although many of us secretly hope her suspension allows her to extend her stay at Harvard.
On Saturday, Sharapova tweeted a picture of herself at Harvard Business School with the caption, “Not sure how this happened but Hey Harvard! Can't wait to start the program!” 
Sharapova accompanies other celebrities, such as actor Channing Tatum, rapper LL Cool J, Chicago Bulls center Pau Gasol, and LA Clippers point guard Chris Paul on the HBS campus. Since these A-listers will be attending Harvard at different times throughout the summer, we recommend investing in a lawn chair to make your celebrity stalking experience a bit more comfortable.
