After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Continuing an unwelcome trend of late, the Crimson men’s tennis team entered the singles against the Pilots one point down, with two choices—fight or flight.
Unsurprisingly, it emphatically opted for the former.
While students were jetting off on their spring break vacation, No. 57 Harvard (7-4) welcomed Portland (11-4) on Friday at the Murr Tennis Center. The Crimson beat the Pilots, 6-1, in the first-ever meeting between the two teams.
Despite a wide margin of victory for Harvard, it was far from smooth sailing. 
For the third consecutive match, the Crimson was forced to rely on a dominant singles display to clinch the win, after the Pilots sent them crashing to another doubles defeat.
“I thought that Portland played great doubles against us,” head coach David Fish ’72 said. “I honestly didn’t know what to expect in the singles if they could keep up that kind of torrid pace.”
In a ruthless singles period, Harvard swept to clear set victories across the courts as the Pilots’ energy levels fell. Freshman Alistair Felton sent the Crimson airborne at No. 3, leveling the scores and claiming victory over freshman Geoff Henandez (6-1, 6-3) through a return winner down the line. Against Portland’s Evan Schleining, No. 6 sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien clinched the decisive fourth point with a 6-3, 7-5 win.
“We’ve been working hard on our singles, and our guys are pretty tough from the baseline, so we weren’t that concerned going into the singles,” said senior co-captain national No. 77 Chris Clayton said. “But our doubles are something we’ve definitely got to keep working on.”
From the outset, the Pilots shook Crimson nerves with an aggressive doubles performance. At No. 2, the combination of Felton and junior Michael Hayes crashed to an 8-3 defeat to Portland’s Joel Kincaid and Nikoloz Kurdadze. Against the Pilot’s Hernandez and Nick Wales, No. 3 partnership Omodele-Lucien and freshman Davis Manghan fought back from 5-0 down, but ultimately fell in an 8-6 loss. The point already lost by Harvard, the No. 1 duo of Clayton and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans fell 8-5—much to the co-captain’s dismay.
“We didn’t win a single doubles point, which is tough,” said Clayton. “So I was pretty angry going into the team room, just because it’s frustrating to have lost the last three doubles points [in last three games].”
If the Crimson wanted to stretch its home winning streak into double figures, it had to respond with four wins in the singles matches. In a statement of intent, five of the Harvard lineup raced into a one-game lead, with all of them ultimately claiming the opening set—the ideal reaction from Fish’s perspective.
“It was definitely a wake up call—you never know quite how you’ll react,” said Fish. “If people panic, you’re in worse trouble…these guys didn’t panic, and just kept going. That’s the sign of a team that’s still growing and getting better.”
The Crimson secured the equalizer through Felton’s fine early win, opening the floodgates for a straight-set singles whitewash. Hot on the heels of the Felton’s success, No. 2 Chijoff-Evans beat Kincaid (6-4, 6-2) with a delicate drop shot, before Hayes secured a 7-5, 6-4 win over Kurdadze at No. 4.
“[Felton] did a fine job by jumping right on the guy right away,” said Fish. “We need to show [that] same kind of aggression in the doubles that we’ve shown in the singles.”
At No. 6, Omodele-Lucien secured the overall win for the Crimson, followed by keenly-contested wins in close succession for No. 5 Mangham against Thorp (6-3, 6-4) and No. 1 Clayton over Zivkovic (7-5, 6-3). 
Set to embark on its annual spring break tour of California—encompassing four opponents in eight days across the Golden State—the Crimson will have an ideal opportunity to lay its doubles point hoodoo to rest. 
With the start of the Ivy League matches less than two weeks away, such a development could prove the key to retaining the championship.
 “These guys are learning right now, and we hope that these are just the sort of lessons we need to do well in the Ivies,” said Fish.—Staff writer Allen J. Padua can be reached at ajpadua@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 16 Harvard men’s lacrosse team had revenge on its mind as it opened Ivy League play against Penn at Harvard Stadium yesterday. Last season, a 12-10 loss to the Quakers sparked a six game losing streak that spoiled the Crimson’s season. Harvard (4-1, 1-0 Ivy) got its payback yesterday, beating Penn (1-4, 0-2) convincingly, 11-4. 
“Today’s game was redemption, getting back at them for last year,” freshman attacker Terry White said. “[Last season] we lost to Penn, and after that it was five losses and the beginning of our downfall. We really wanted to change it this year and go in the opposite direction at this point of the season.” 
White would be the standout on the afternoon, notching a career-high two goals. His first score was the Crimson’s initial goal of the game. With Harvard trailing 1-0, junior midfielder Dave Dobrosky found White on the left wing where the freshman ripped a shot past Quaker goaltender Joe Hegener.  
White’s goal set off a deluge of first period scores from which Penn would never recover. One minute after the Crimson tied the score, junior attacker Travis Burr gathered the ball in the middle of the offensive zone where he split the defense, sprinted towards the goal, and buried a close range shot. 
After Harvard won the ensuing faceoff, senior midfielder Nick Smith fought off defenders as he raced down the left sideline. Smith shoveled a pass to sophomore midfielder Christian Oberbeck, who bounced a shot into the top of the net to give the Crimson a 3-1 lead. 
Minutes later, sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons carried the ball behind the goal and found senior defenseman Eric Posner cutting in front of the net. Posner caught the ball and one-timed it past Hegener for the score. 
Harvard notched its final goal of the period just before time expired. This time, junior midfielder Jason Duboe assisted freshman attacker Jeff Cohen, who received the ball directly in front of the net and snuck it into the goal with two seconds remaining. 
Neither side scored in the second period, sending the Crimson into halftime with a 5-1 lead. Harvard held an 18-12 advantage in shots and a 12-10 edge in groundballs while winning the turnover battle, 9-7.  
Senior goaltender Joe Pike made three of his four saves in the first half on what would be a relatively easy day between the pipes. 
“Our defense played great,” Pike said. “We barely had the ball down there.”  
Penn tried to rally in the second half, scoring two goals early in the third period to cut the lead to 6-3. However, White answered with his second goal of the night when he shook his defender and fired a lefty shot into the bottom of the net. 
“I was lucky enough to get the first goal,” White said. “After that I was a little more confident taking the ball to the net.” 
Towards the end of the third period, another freshman, Cohen, extended the lead. Again assisted by Duboe, Cohen received the ball wide-open on the right side of the goal where he buried the shot. It was his team-leading 11th tally on the season. 
“Those guys have a lot of potential as we’re starting to see,” Harvard coach John Tillman said of the two freshmen. “We need it right now. We’re hoping that some of these young guys can help us win key games, and those two guys stepped up for us.” 
Harvard finished the game on a 3-1 run, including two goals from Duboe and one from Gibbons. The Crimson ultimately outshot the Quakers 40-18 en route to an 11-4 victory. 
“I’m happy for our guys to start off and get a league win off the get-go; it’s really important,” Tillman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team appeared to have made strides after its thrilling 14-12 win last Wednesday at Connecticut, but the Crimson (3-4) could not carry its momentum over to No. 12 Boston University’s Nickerson Field yesterday, falling to the Terriers (5-3), 17-12.  BU’s McKinley Curro found the back of the net three times within the first five minutes of the game, and the Terriers never looked back.
After Curro’s flurry of goals, Harvard answered with two tallies of its own—one each by freshman Tyler Petropulous and senior Kaitlin Martin—to bring the Crimson within one.  After BU expanded its lead to 4-2, Harvard again cut the Terriers’ lead to just a goal, on a score by junior tri-captain Sara Flood.  But Harvard was never able to close further on BU’s lead— the Terriers outshot the Crimson 18-10 in the first half and went into intermission up, 8-4.
According to sophomore Jess Halpern, the Crimson was too tentative on offense in the first half.  “We were not challenging the goal enough, making too many careless mistakes and not capitalizing on opportunities,” she said.  
“[At halftime] Coach told us we needed to be smarter, challenge the goal and believe in ourselves,” Halpern added.
Halpern took her coach’s advice to heart and had a prolific second frame.  The sophomore scored all five of her goals in the final period, including three of Harvard’s first four scores of the half.
Yet even Halpern’s performance, as well as Petropulous’ four goals and one assist, could not propel Harvard over the twelth-ranked Terriers.  BU’s Sarah Dalton and Curro finished the contest with five goals apiece, and in the process Dalton—a senior All-American—broke her school’s career-scoring record with her 191st goal.
Riding the stellar performances of its scoring leaders, the Terriers cruised to a 17-12 win.
“Whenever you play a ranked team, it is expected that they will be fast and athletic,” Flood said.  “Even if we went down, we were going to play for the full sixty minutes.”
“The score doesn’t necessarily reflect it, but we were ready to go,” she added.
In preparation for the Crimson’s upcoming games, both Flood and Halpern agree that the team must work on its defense structure to be successful.  Flood also believes that it is crucial for the team to cut down on its unforced turnovers, while Halpern believes the Crimson must work on its draw controls.  In the BU contest, Harvard controlled only ten of the 31 draws of the game.
Harvard heads to Albany on Wednesday for the final game of its three game road trip, before returning to Cambridge for a three-game home stand that includes Ivy rivals Yale and Penn.
