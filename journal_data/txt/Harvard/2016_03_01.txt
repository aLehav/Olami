After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Consider a short-answer test, from which students must choose one of several questions to answer. Now imagine a student picks the question that he finds most appealing but is least prepared to answer, yet still persists in its execution. This hypothetical situation does not presage a P-Set full of word problems. Instead, it describes “First Day of School,” a floundering production which ran Feb. 19-20 at Arts @ 29 Garden.
The play, written by Billy Aronson of “Rent” and “Beavis and Butthead” fame and directed by Julia E. Belanoff ’18, tracks several parents as they while away a rare free day, having dropped their kids off on the first day of school and finding themselves aimless and without commitments. Belanoff, who has shown her talent as an actress in previous Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club productions, wrote in her director’s note that she fell in love with the play after seeing a San Francisco Playhouse production performed by her favorite actors and that it raises questions such as, “How can intellectual, passionate, and overcommitted individuals meet their most basic needs while living high intensity lives?” While this question—a herculean one—ostensibly applies to undergraduates, the play itself struggled to address it.
“We have this one chance to do something special,” Susan (Liz Kantor ’18) says to her husband, David (Ben G. Cort ’18, a Fifteen Minutes Magazine executive), nailing the tempo of her line but lacking the gravity of a frustrated parent. Indeed, all of the actors, failing to inhabit their roles, struggled to move the production from sheer line delivery to the hilarious farce that the play potentially could have become. Although Cort has impeccable comedic timing throughout the performance, lines like “Hey, do you want to look at dryers?” bring no understated middle-aged wryness to the table. Lacking credibility, “First Day of School” failed before it could write its name at the top of the proverbial exam.
What followed was a going-through-the-motions enactment of Susan’s suggestion that she and David “should try having sex with other people” during the unaccounted-for hours. This line, on which the ensuing action depends, failed to pack a punch or to prompt its intended take-a-step-back moment. And when Susan and David ultimately manage to corner fellow parents Peter (Patric C.W. Verrone ’18, a Crimson Arts columnist), Kim (Ali Astin ’19), and Alice (Sara Bobok ’19) in their home for some grown-up fun, the actors, though they have been directed to have the shrugs, fidgets, and fast-talking patter of tightly-wound, neurotic parents, are still not believable. When Peter asks Susan, “Why can’t I just stick my head in your hair and just sniff it?” as he considers her uninhibited proposition for sex without consequences, he is so manic that he comes across as simply anal-retentive, more a crazy teen than a father who flipped his lid. Perhaps Belanoff chose to so characterize Peter, but these choices proved awkward; they did not suit the crumpled-but-suave man looking to move beyond a broken marriage, stressful job, and children in their terrible twos.
The Arts @ 29 Garden space, infrequently used by HRDC productions, also had foreseeable problems. For instance, many of the one-on-one exchanges between Susan or David and the parent each one was trying to seduce took place in a nook, angled awkwardly from the central staging area. The transitions between that nook and the sparsely-decorated central living room felt rushed and sporadic. One scene—where Cort and Astin successfully tackled physical comedy, though perhaps not with the intended undertones—made use of a balcony area, but the aim of the staging decisions seemed to be simply to use as many cool spaces as possible.
While there is no retest for this production, on the bright side, the “First Day of School” comes around every year. Next time, the cast can try again, now maybe knowing which questions to answer.

It’s a month and a half into 2016, and “Broad City” Season 3 already has the best opening scene of the whole year. Wednesday’s episode opens on the aftermath of the Season 2 finale: a split screen of Abbi and Ilana in their respective bathrooms (and still wearing their “Challah Back” and “Female Body Inspector” shirts). The show then establishes the time gap between seasons so entertainingly it’s easy to forget the narrative goal: Abbi flushes a dead goldfish after Pride while Ilana makes out with an unidentified woman in her own bathroom; Abbi flirts absurdly with a repairman while Ilana shaves her bikini line; various sex acts happen in the vicinity of both toilets; and, of course, both repeatedly make use of the bathroom ventilation to get high sans stench. The last shot, of both of them smoking from bongs on their toilets, leads straight into the rest of the episode—a pitch-perfect continuation of the absurd, pointed humor that Glazer and Jacobson executed so well though the show’s first two seasons.
There’s nothing in this episode that isn't funny—unless, perhaps, Ilana’s bloody struggle to remove her bike chain or her defacing of a painting moved too far into the realm of cringeworthy. They certainly didn't for me. But it is clearer than ever in this episode that the most hilarious and clever moves that Broad City makes are frequently its most subtle. One of the highlights of this episode was Lincoln’s inexplicable decision to go to circus school and the horrible puns that accompany that choice (“Swingers,” says Lincoln, laughing to himself). The scene is entirely self-contained, but its absolute absurdity elevates the entire episode.
Nor have Glazer and Jacobson dulled their social critique: If anything, they have provocatively widened their net. This first episode repeatedly parodies stereotypical white feminism in the person of Ilana, who is so upset by an article about women in Saudi Arabia that she has to masturbate to blow off steam before meeting Abbi for brunch. Later, she reacts with disproportionate indignation to a “Men at Work” sign. Even in the midst of this parody, Glazer and Jacobson hardly give the patriarchy a pass—another of the best moments of the episode comes when a porn-watching truck driver yells, “Nice ass” at Abbi, and she screams back, “I know!”
Queerness, too, seems more present on the show than it has been in the past. Ilana’s crush on Abbi certainly hasn’t abated—after Abbi rescues her from being carried away on the back of a truck, Ilana proposes and then immediately denies what she said. And the moment in the first scene in which Ilana makes out with a girl after Pride is more significant than its short duration would imply. This episode makes absolutely clear that Ilana Wexler is the most visible bisexual character on TV right now. And it’s difficult to imagine a comedian better suited to that role than Glazer.

It is a shame that the Oscars left this week’s episode of “The Walking Dead” on the DVR back burner. To echo a phrase veteran fans of the series too often recite, this is the episode the show needed. Jesus himself boldly asserts that our survivors’ “world is about to get a whole lot bigger,” and his promise rings true. The majority of the main cast make an exodus to Jesus’s “Hilltop” in order to trade for desperately needed food. What they find is the opportunity to explore yet another community driven by conflicting ethics. “Knots Untie” propels the typically meandering, loose narrative of the “The Walking Dead” into sharp focus as the characters prepare for an all-out offensive on Negan and his Saviors.
The stars of this episode are Crazy Rick (as always) and, surprisingly, Maggie. Rick, never one to voluntarily back down in a confrontation and always one to point his revolver first and ask questions later, goes unchallenged. Fatigued from constantly being the show’s tragic hero and being forced to shed whatever remains of his humanity, however, Rick passes the baton of leadership and scapegoat-ery to Maggie. She refreshingly comes onto her own as a stronger, more active character than any woman we have seen on this show, blending prior mentor’s Deanne’s practicality with Rick’s assertiveness. In two fascinating verbal and gender-charged duels with Gregory, Hilltop’s ostensible mayor and bona-fide Southern gentleman, Maggie defies his womanizing condescension and instead adopts an aggressive diplomacy. She is the one who demands.
The episode goes to great lengths to foreshadow the potential deaths of certain survivors, namely Glenn and Abraham. This is particularly true when the show suddenly invests an odd amount of screentime and emotional development into typically passive characters (i.e. Tyrese and Noah) in order to make their loss all the more tragic. For Glenn, the episode often dwells on his anxiety over placing Maggie and his future child into danger. The camera constantly hovers over Maggie’s stomach, a doting Glenn near her side.
Abraham’s history of violence and uncontrollable anger is revisited through altercations with other survivors, in which he struggles to preserve his own humanity and display mercy. The show suggests that his newfound love for Sasha, even in the midst of his sexual relationship with Rosita, has motivated him to embrace tranquility instead of chaos (one of the show’s favorite dichotomies). As a result of past trauma, in which violence both saved and ruined his life, Abraham has always been the brash, animalistic, and hyper-aggressive presence. In witnessing Sasha rediscover peace, Abraham has placed any remaining hope of a better life in their relationship. Though this arc seems like it could and should be beautiful, it is instead executed gracelessly in a love-triangle with repeated intercuts to the same exact scene in which Abraham realizes his affections for Sasha.
“Knots Untie” drastically moves the narrative forward to facing Negan while reminding viewers why they should care about certain characters: They may very well die soon. Negan still remains but a name spoken with dread, but his reputation of ruthlessness increases the stakes to the point where not even Glenn’s plot armor could save him. Fingers crossed that the writers decide to diverge from the comic books this time around.

Celebrities renovate their public images all the time, but few—if any—have matched the drama and sheer absurdity of Shia LaBeouf’s transformation. Once the fresh-faced star of the “Transformers” series, LaBeouf decided around 2014 to become something of a postmodernist: He transformed his Twitter into self-professed “meta-modernist performance art” and appeared at the Berlin Film Festival wearing a brown paper bag emblazoned with the words “I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE.” This past week, LaBeouf added another bewildering work to his oeuvre by standing in an elevator for 24 hours—a project he dubbed #ELEVATE.
Is #ELEVATE really all that elevated, though? On first glance, not really. Judging from the live stream of the event, not much happened except for a participant getting gently slapped in the face at his own request. LaBeouf seemed like a celebrity just messing around and trying to maintain a degree of name recognition, using yet another bizarre and memetic event to create a sort of brand—weirdness as marketable identity, like Lady Gaga or early Nicki Minaj.
Then again, LaBeouf seems to fascinate and confuse people in ways that no pop star ever has. Witness the completely inexplicable and amazing “‘Shia LaBeouf’ Live” by singer-songwriter Rob Cantor: The production utilizes ballet dancers, two separate choruses, an orchestra, and paper-mache heads to tell the nightmarish story of “actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf.” The video has over 33 million views on YouTube, probably because it perceptively captures the opaque and entirely individual strangeness of the man. LaBeouf is more than just eye-catching—he’s actually unsettling (maybe legitimately cannibal-like) in his endless and inscrutably serious performance.
And this performance might actually have a degree of artistic merit. When all of LaBeouf’s endeavors are considered collectively, they slowly come into focus as an intriguing investigation into the nature of fame. In continuously plagiarizing famous apologies on his Twitter and wearing a self-castigating paper bag, LaBeouf mocked the repetitive and somewhat vicious culture surrounding celebrity transgression and apology. When he hosted a marathon of his own movies, he called attention to his own reproducibility and the vacuousness of those reproduced images. The overriding thesis, it seems, has something to do with the simultaneous magnifying and emptying of personal identity that comes with fame—and it’s an idea as compelling as it is disturbing.
#ELEVATE departs slightly from this tradition: It renders LaBeouf accessible rather than remote, emphasizing his selfhood rather than bizarrely erasing it. If all goes well, participants leave the elevator grinning, telling their friends what a nice guy Shia LaBeouf is and how he rides in elevators like normal people. However, the structure of the project ultimately calls attention to the personal entrapment and artificiality behind such encounters. It debunks the notion of the “just-like-us” celebrity just as it seems to reinforce it, and it does so cleverly and movingly.
Oddly enough, #ELEVATE suggests a comparison between Shia LaBeouf and lauded author Ben Lerner. A MacArthur Fellow, a Fulbright Scholar, and a finalist for the National Book Award, Lerner writes novels that blur the line between fiction and memoir: “Leaving the Atocha Station” and “10:04” both use the instinctive tendency to conflate author and protagonist in an exploration of power, fame, and warped identity. The project even extends to Lerner’s in-person appearances. He affects modesty and unrehearsed ease, but repeats almost the same speeches over and over again.
Who, then, is Ben Lerner? Is he his self-castigating, cripplingly self-reflexive protagonists? A likable, unpretentious author? Someone else entirely? His fame allows us to claim intimacy with him, but we actually have no access to his real self. And that all sounds like Shia LaBeouf. His methods—constant performance, self-duplication—are largely the same as Lerner’s, and his arguments about identity, celebrity, and connection are strikingly similar. Elevate away, then, even if Lerner does wear fewer paper bags.

“A Man Alive” is a pleasant enough album to listen to disinterestedly. Holding it to the standard of a listener with rapt attention, it crumbles under its wobbling bass lines. The surprisingly directionless effort is Thao & The Get Down Stay Down’s sixth album. For better or worse, the band operates in the indefinable space between folk rock and halfhearted experimental hip-hop. Their previous effort, “We the Common,” was a meditation on the common human experience with the occasional turn towards liberal political populism  (if that sounds broad, it is because the topicality of their previous work is broad). While lacking in cohesive musical vision, both in lyrics and sound, “We the Common” still felt fun. “A Man Alive” has lost much of this vibrancy.
There is a disconnect between what the album was intended to be and what it is. In a press release, Thao Nguyen, the frontwoman of Thao & The Get Down Stay Down, said “[The album is] a document of my life in conjunction with [my dad’s], even though we’ve always been leading our lives away from each other.” Yet, without this piece of information, the album reads like the divulgence of emotions towards spurned lovers and ejaculations of various maxims. Some of these pieces are successful, most are not—the complete dissonance between intent and product begins to reveal a larger trend of impotent eloquence.
Thao Nguyen’s voice—the only noticeable voice through the entirety of the album—is wearing. Not in a way that grows loveable after a while; rather, in a way that desperately necessitates an intermission, an interlude or at least a feature. In isolation each song can be, in the right circumstance, enjoyable, but her unending desire for vocal modulation creates an insufferable presence at the center of the album. Her voice is not explicitly unpleasant; she derives a depth of tenderness from it on “Nobody Dies” and “Millionaire.” However, on the vast majority of songs, she obscures her talent through irritating singing. This is no more noticeable than in the opening moments of “Departure,” where she warbles, “Here is a memory. Learn to save it.” Each word carries with it a new note, and each new note feels like an unsettling refusal to remain on the tone. It sounds as if she is singing a badly written duet, with the singers singing the same song two semitones apart. This is such a shame; lyrically, “Departure” is a fascinating meditation on a human understanding of death. She goes on to say, “We are not born for departure. But we do learn to take it.” There is a fantastic and complex interplay between the nature of death and memory occurring here. Yet, the occasional brilliance of her lyrics is lost with her refusal to elucidate them comprehensibly and pleasantly.
The problems of “A Man Alive” certainly do not start and end with Nguyen. The album’s refusal to commit to one definable musical sphere could have created an ethereal, unendingly interesting musical statement. However, when Thao & The Get Down Stay Down cycle through these musical genres, they fail to truly commit to any of the most compelling facets of these genres. “Meticulous Bird” can only be called hip-hop because her verses are sung in a monotone voice and she attempts to use a close rhyme scheme. She unfortunately raps, “I resent the invention, listen, listen, pay attention,” repeating “listen,” for no reason outside of fitting her lyrics to the beat. As a group, the band seem woefully underprepared to fill these songs with the vibrancy of the genres from which they borrow. Precisely because of this, despite the outward appearance of musical diversity, the entirety of the album feels unendingly self-plagiaristic of previous work.
With this said, “A Man Alive” has moments of true empathetic brilliance. “Astonished Man” is a quarter of a great song, opening with a fantastic bass line that moves and twists with undeniable vitality, melding with and elevating Nguyen’s voice. Fifty-five seconds into the song, the magic created by this marriage is gone; Nguyen’s voice has reverted to unpleasant and the rest of the sound is oversaturated. Most of these twelve tracks have these moments of brilliance. Only a few, “Nobody Dies” and “Endless Love” in particular, are able to sustain it over the whole span of four minutes. “Millionaire,” the only song that is able to successfully convey the premise of the album, is sung with such tenderness that it demands empathy from the listener: “Shatter all you will not carry. Smash what you won’t bear. Oh daddy I’ve broken into a million pieces. That makes you a millionaire.” If only the promise of this one song was carried throughout the rest of the album. Instead, we are left with broken pieces, fragments of talent.

Created by none other than highly acclaimed comedic director-producer Judd Apatow, Netflix’s television series “Love” debuted its first season on Feb. 19. “Love” is a romantic dramedy that finds Apatow employing characteristically unabashed displays of sex and drugs and venturing to probe into dark relationship issues that are too often swept under the rug.
At its surface, the season follows the lives of Mickey, played by Gillian Jacobs, and Gus, played by Paul Rust, with an even focus on both their individual and linked stories. Mickey—attractive, wild, and rebellious—and Gus—dorky, awkward, and naïve—couldn’t be more fundamentally different; however, they find common ground in their failed relationships and inability to find order in their lives.
The series starts off on a strong note. From the get-go, it’s clear that the production benefits from stellar casting. Jacobs’ raspy voice and effortlessly mischievous aura and Rust’s nasal intonations and gawky frame make for solid and realistic depictions of their prototypical characters. Its profane and sarcastic dialogue is genuinely funny, and coupled with respectable comedic timing and delivery, it succeeds in creating laugh-out-loud moments. The series also finds quiet strength in its soundtrack; underground indie folk and soft pop do well in adding to or strategically muting the intensity of scenes, particularly scenes of loneliness, heartbreak, or introspection. Each episode’s end credits feature a different classic juke-box-esque love song that somehow always manages to evoke a surge of warmth, as if to encourage its viewer to continue on to the next episode.
Past its humorous and light-hearted exterior, the series finds substance by probing into disquieting and frighteningly relevant issues in relationships. Much of the success of “Love” lies in its ambition to comprehensively encompass every dimension of what love exactly is—whether sensual, physical, romantic, selfless, selfish, uneven, inauthentic, or destructive. “Love” triumphs in unearthing and humanizing dark concepts such as alcoholism, drug addiction and mental instability, which often come as baggage in modern relationships. The show packages heavy emotional issues beneath a generally light-hearted exterior so that people can easily digest them—its pockets of profundity are all the more impactful for it, and the contrast often makes you pause to absorb and admire its meaning.
The foremost problem of the series lies in the rather sluggish pace of the first season. Episodes are often bogged down by periods of uninteresting dialogue that aren’t as substantive as they could be. There is solid characterization, and it’s easy to want to root for Gus and Mickey initially because their flaws are meant to be reflections of our own. However, the directorial focus lies so much on showcasing their flaws that it takes away time from other qualities that may have made them more likeable. The task of warming up to them becomes unnecessarily difficult.
Although the pace of its pilot season was relatively slow, the series at this point has managed to exhibit great potential as a dramedy through a substantial number of both funny and meaningful moments. Scenes like these make the first season really worth a try and make up for flaws that have the potential to rectify themselves in future episodes.
Season 2 of “Love” is set to premiere in February 2017.

Bent Shapes are, perhaps, the consummate Boston-based band—a self-described “hyperliterate, tightly-wound, and irreverent” quartet, performing jangly garage rock with a healthy dash of critical theory. In advance of the Mar. 11 release of their second album “Wolves of Want” on Slumberland Records, The Harvard Crimson had the chance to sit down with frontman Ben Potrykus and drummer Andy Sadoway.
The Harvard Crimson: What are you most excited for about the new album?
Ben Potrykus: I’m just excited for people to hear it because we finished it almost a year ago. With the way release schedules were going, what Slumberland could do, and the lead time that we needed, it worked out that it wasn’t going to be until the following spring that it would be released.
THC: Have you been performing the new music yet?
Andy Sadoway: We made a little bit of a conscious decision to roll back how much we were playing.… We knew that once the record came out we were going to sell and share it with everybody, so we thought, why don’t we just chill out and work on some other stuff.
THC: Are there shows you are particularly excited about in your upcoming tour?
BP: I’m most excited about all the bands that I’ve found [to perform with] that I’ve been like, “Oh crap, I had no idea!” …  These bands that I never would have heard of if we weren’t touring through a place. Some of them, they were busy, but they might come out to the show or they might trade shows. I think that’s the most fun thing about booking. The fun part is making those connections.
THC: Are you moving in new directions on the upcoming album?
AS: The difference between the last record and this one is that we’re a four-piece band now, which for recording really helped round out the way the song is shaped.… Our first record was kind of a mix-tape of everything we had worked on for the first four years of being a band. And this was stuff that was written over the course of a shorter period of time.
THC: What inspired the new album?
BP: Lyrically, the album is mostly about my anxiety in particular. I have had pretty acute symptoms at points in the past couple years. I finally kind of set out to deal with them with level of self-compassion maybe that I hadn’t had previously. It’s a hard thing to reach out for help.… And I think putting that into songs has been really useful for me.
The other kind of ongoing theme I guess, for me, is my interest in radical politics. Systematic oppression is huge in our culture.… I know that I’m rehashing a lot of ideas that pop up in political theory or even in other art forms or songs, but it’s interesting for me to write about them in a pop song. There’s something funny to me about music or slogans that have been screamed by the Black Block or slogans that were used in the student riots in Paris in the 1960’s over kind a of doo-woppy sounding pop song.
THC: What role do you feel music can play politically?
BP: At times in my life I’ve felt really useless writing about stuff.… Maybe using direct action. You can be an activist or an advocate on behalf of people who are disenfranchised—an ally, I guess. You are always running the risk of speaking for people.… Basically, I think [music] can inspire people and I think even people who are fighting oppression every day in very real ways that involve a certain level of emotional upheaval for them need something to center and ground themselves. And that doesn’t have to be political—it could be like watching reality TV just to blow off steam or like riding your bike with Killer Mike blasting.
THC: What is the significance of the title of the album?
BP: “Wolves of Want” comes from a short piece that was written by Lucy Parsons who was an activist.… She talks about how despite working really hard and working to make a life for yourself you’re never more than a few days ahead of “the wolves of want.” … [This is] the personification of some of the themes of the album, whether it be the need for comfort, or the need for emotional support.
THC: How do you feel about the Boston scene?
AS: Obviously students change, undergrads change.… There is fresh blood all the time.… I think it’s kind of exciting.… We do things on our own terms and we have fun in the process.

Last week, the Harvard South Asian Association presented the 27th Ghungroo, a performance combining South Asian dance and music, in Agassiz Theater. Directed by Avinash Saraf ’17, Kruti B. Vora ’17, and Madhavi L. Narayanan ’17 and produced by Kavya Pathak ’17 and Nishant Kakar ’17, Ghungroo involved about 400 student performers and included a variety of South Asian musical performance styles, from Indian classical dance to hip-hop-inspired pieces. This year’s show sold out four performances and introduced a new skit and a charity partnership focused on mental health issues.
After the show, the producers and directors sat down with The Harvard Crimson to discuss the making of Ghungroo and the new elements that they brought to the performance this year.
The Harvard Crimson: Compared to previous Ghungroo shows, what has stayed the same and what has changed this year?
Nishant Kakar: The basic layout of it continues: [There are] regular dances and there’s a senior dance. But I think what really changed this year is the entire flow of the show. Last year, each dance was pretty separate… but now the skit has really integrated all the dances together. And we also have a really strong theme of mental health through the skit, which we really put a lot of effort in to make happen. We wanted to use the stage to deliver a message to the South Asian audience, and mental health is an issue that particularly affects a lot of people in the South Asian diaspora… Now we want to use the profits to donate to this particular organization called CHAI [Counselors Helping (South) Asians/Indians], which is related to mental health. We’re hoping that this year could be a stepping stone for future shows to put in more and more.
THC: How many people were involved in the creative process of the show?
Kavya Pathak: We have eight regular dances, and each has two choreographers…. There are nine segments in senior dances, and each has two to four choreographers. We have a tech team of 20, a production team of 12, three directors, and a lot of dancers.
Nishant Kakar: We try to make it as inclusive as possible for everyone on campus. People don’t have to audition for our show, which is really important. We want to give everyone a chance to be on stage.
THC: How did you, as directors, envision a way to address the issue of mental health?
Kruti Vora:  One of the challenges that we faced when planning this is that we really wanted to address this issue, but we also understand that the audience want a light-hearted and fun show. [Mental health] is not an issue that we should be trivializing at all, and we want to address it in a very respectful and meaningful way. So our skit directors especially did an amazing job balancing this light-hearted and fun aspect where we can still make jokes about Tinder and “riding the D,” but we can [also] have these incredible monologues and dialogues that we hope would really make people talk about this issue beyond just the theatre.
THC: What inspired the sets, costumes, and other visual elements of the show?
Kruti Vora: The set is wedding-themed because the show is set at a wedding. So the little circular thing in the back, the gate, with the draping, that’s called a Mandap. That’s normally in Hindu weddings. The design on the floor with the green that’s incorporated is called a Mandala. The colors of Indian weddings, I guess, are more like red and gold. More south Indian weddings and Muslim weddings highlight green, and the design of colors and geometry is more like a Muslim-influenced design. So we really try to blend in many different cultures. This is the first year that we made a policy that all the dances had to choose at least one non-Hindi song to try and represent different cultures as well.

“I recollect the ocean rumbling: / O how I envied then the waves— / Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling / To fall about her feet like slaves!” So begins one of the most memorable cantos of Alexander Pushkin’s 1830 novel in verse, “Eugene Onegin,” a work that seems almost destined to become dance. On Thursday night, the Boston Ballet presented a stunning rendition of “Onegin,” choreographer John Cranko’s 1965 adaptation of the story of the partly tragic, partly ironic love affair of the cynical aristocrat Onegin and the young noblewoman Tatiana. With exceptional performances by leads Petra Conti and Lasha Khozashvili, the Boston Ballet’s retelling of the story combined virtuosity and psychological depth.
In Pushkin’s novel, the bored St. Petersburg fop Onegin, visiting his poet friend Lensky in the Russian countryside, meets the latter’s beautiful fiancée, Olga. Olga’s bookish sister, Tatiana, falls desperately in love with Onegin, whom she invests with all the qualities of the heroes in her romantic novels. She writes him a passionate letter, which he coldly returns. Bored again, Onegin begins flirting with Olga at a country dance, a caprice that ends tragically when Lensky challenges Onegin to a duel and Onegin kills his friend. The novel resumes some years later with Onegin’s return to St. Petersburg, where he meets Tatiana, now married and an admired society woman. Instantly in love, Onegin writes Tatiana an anguished letter of appeal. Echoing Onegin’s refusal of her love years before, she returns the letter to him, choosing to remain with her husband despite her own enduring passion for Onegin.
Conti, who danced the role of Tatiana with precision and passion in the ballet’s premiere on Thursday night, established the story’s compelling emotional center, while Khozashvili as Onegin performed with superb athleticism. The couple’s two pas de deux—the first Tatiana’s dream of Onegin in Act One and the second Onegin’s desperate plea for Tatiana’s love in Act Three—were the highlights of the night. Conti seemed almost weightless in a series of breathtakingly graceful lifts in the dream sequence. She vividly portrayed Tatiana’s agonized love for Onegin in the final scene, culminating in a single agitated gesture in which she tenderly stroked his hair, then pointed him out the door. The contrast with Tatiana’s controlled pas de deux with her husband in the previous scene, a study in mannered elegance, made clear her feelings for the two men. Conti’s anguished, fluttering solo in Act Two as she sees Onegin dancing with her sister also provided a moment of poignant inwardness in the midst of the social whirl of the ball scene.
Ashley Ellis as Olga and Patrick Yocum as Lensky provided effective—if less emotionally engaging—performances. Ellis embodied both Olga’s grace and her vapidity. Yocum struck the perfect note as the hopelessly romantic poet, with whom Pushkin sometimes seems to sympathize and at other times seems to mock.
The ballet also reflected one of the central themes of Pushkin’s novel: the way in which art and life come to mirror each other in an endless reciprocal process of representation and construction. In “Onegin,” the dancers were in many scenes impersonating dancers. Moreover, in the Boston Ballet’s staging of the story, Tatiana sees Onegin for the first time as a reflection in her mirror, suggesting that her lover is in many ways a figment of her own imagination, nourished by novels. The ballet perfectly captured the blurring of the boundaries between reality and fiction, life and art, that characterizes Pushkin’s world.
The ballet also effectively described Pushkin’s historical context. Early nineteenth century Russia, still adapting to the Westernizing reforms of Peter the Great, was itself a performative society. Peter required the nobility to adopt Western European manners and dress, to speak French in society, and, in effect, to perform their everyday lives. Cranko’s ballet alludes to this dualism in Russian cultural life: His choreography includes both a traditional Russian folk dance on Tatiana’s family estate in the countryside and a waltz at her palace in St. Petersburg.
In one of the first scenes of Pushkin’s novel, Onegin attends a ballet in St. Petersburg. Pushkin writes of one of the dancers: “She spins and twists and stops to beat / Her rapid, dazzling, dancing feet.” Bored as ever, Onegin leaves the theater early. The Boston Ballet’s production of “Onegin” combined the dazzling athleticism Pushkin describes with an equally compelling emotional intensity. Even Eugene might have stayed to the end.
The Boston Ballet’s “Onegin” runs through March 6 at Boston Opera House.

On Saturday, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra played Gustav Mahler’s “Totenfeier” and Jean Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2 with elegance and poignant melodic sensibility.  Led by conductor and music director Federico Cortese, the undergraduate orchestra delivered an enthralling performance for Junior Parents’ Weekend in Sanders Theatre.
Mahler’s “Totenfeier,” or “Funeral Rites,” may be best known as the opening movement to his Symphony No. 2, but the composer conceived of the piece originally in 1888 as a stand-alone tone poem. While Mahler modified the piece considerably for its inclusion in his later symphony, the original composition represents an important moment in his musical career and deserves adequate recognition. The somber piece carries an immense aesthetic gravity: As he stated in later program notes, Mahler intended the piece as a contemplation of questions of life and death.
Overall, the orchestra effectively conveyed the piece’s emotional intensity. In places where Mahler’s score is sparse, the orchestra’s sound was thin. For the most part, however, the orchestra conveyed the tremendous variety in timbre and the rich texture of the music with dexterity and passion.
As the concert continued, the orchestra seemed to gain confidence and cohesion. The second piece on the program was Sibelius’s Symphony No. 2, which the composer himself described as “a confession of the soul.” Perhaps most beloved and best-known of Sibelius’s seven symphonies, the composition was crucial to his rise as a composer and as a Finnish cultural hero.
On Saturday night, HRO gave full expression to the symphony’s bold, adventurous lyricism. The woodwinds handled the sections in which they played alone with simultaneous zest and ease, while the brass provided a warm tone throughout, with moments of golden-hued glory.  The bassoons handled their sweetly melodic theme in the second movement with finesse. The strings shone throughout the performance: They held a consistent mellifluous timbre and were the primary driving force of the tension and release that pulled the symphony forward. They excelled during the fast scherzo of the symphony’s third movement, hovering with incredible energy above the brass and percussion that formed the backbone of the orchestra’s sound.
The fourth and final movement of Sibelius’s symphony was the climactic moment of both the piece and HRO’s performance. The violins, led by concertmaster Emma J. Frucht ’17 skillfully built up, then reined in, then set free the melodic momentum. The piece ended on a shimmering note of vibrato in the high strings, which beautifully dissolved into silence—and then, of course, applause.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On this past week’s episode of “Broad City,” Ilana Wexler, a hyperbolized version of writer Ilana Glazer, said the B-word.
Frequent pot-smoker Ilana is entirely free-spirited and deeply sexual. She’s one of the few female characters on television who successfully engages in casual sexual relationships without guilt or emotional conflict. Throughout most of the first two seasons, her partners, from long-term relationships to one-night stands, are all men. And then, in the second to last episode of season 2, Ilana engages in an intensely passionate affair with actress Alia Shawkat. Though the fling only lasts an episode, it both subverts and confirms all suspicions about the sexuality of one of the show’s main characters.
This relationship doesn’t come as a surprise to Ilana’s best friend Abbi, at least not because of the genders of those involved. It is seen as acceptable and normal, hardly out of the realm of Ilana’s behavior. However, Ilana doesn’t put a label on herself until the next season, in an excited declaration to long-term partner Lincoln: “We are open sex friends, we are poly, we are bi.”
As ephemeral as words are, they matter. To identify with a word imbues it with intense personal meaning. Hearing such identifying words can both build up and tear down conceptions of them.
I first heard the word bisexual during an accidental viewing of Tila Tequila’s “A Shot at Love.” I was 12. That one window into this new word, this strange word, made me wary of the idea it encapsulated for years. As I started to realize that my attractions weren’t confined to one gender, I was extremely reluctant to take on the bisexual label. It felt weighty, political, and somehow wrong to identify as bi.
If we look to the world of television, my reluctance seems perfectly normal. Most characters, even if they have relationships with or show attraction to multiple genders, identify as straight or gay based on their current partner. Many simply don’t address their labels at all, leaving audiences to speculate wildly. Most fans tend to claim a character with ambiguous sexuality for themselves, those most underrepresented populations fighting for the few televised individuals to whom we can relate.
Bisexuality, particularly female bisexuality, seems to scare a lot of people. From partners of all genders who express concerns over being left for someone of a different gender to girl-on-girl action being fetishized as fodder for the male gaze, our society doesn’t like the idea of healthy female sexuality that spans the gender spectrum. It doesn’t much like the idea of any healthy female sexuality, but I digress.
I speak out about my bisexuality with some frequency. I make Facebook posts and write articles about it. I put it in bios on social media. Although some motivation is personal, I often use this assertion of my identity as a political statement. I feel that I need to be vocal so others can hear it, so those struggling with their sexuality feel less alone, so those who are quick to dismiss my sexuality are forced to listen to it.
Words have power. As Albus Dumbledore once said, “Fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself.” To hear words is to feel comfort in them, to accept them. TV’s frequent shying away from the b-word, from naming bisexual identity, only adds to the stigma we face as we move through the world. It’s easier to say something isn’t real if we don’t hear about it. To see oneself on screen is empowering. Not to is disheartening.
I still look into myself and am often afraid of what I find. I toss words around: “lesbian,” “pansexual,” “queer.” “Bisexual” feels important and right, but it feels scary. It is forever unseen, unviewed. I can draw a clear line from bi-invisibility in reality to lack of representation on TV, and though television can’t be entirely blamed, it has remained eerily silent in a place where it could speak up.
Last week I attended a discussion group for young bisexuals in the Boston area. As our conversation meandered around a table at a coffee shop in Jamaica Plain, someone brought up the point that relationships of any kind with other bisexual people feel different, even from those with other LGTQ+ identified people. There’s a camaraderie there and an unspoken understanding. It feels comfortable.

The ArchAngels
Peter vaguely understood that his wings weren’t like the ArchAngels’, like Michael’s or Uriel’s. He had sometimes accidentally glimpsed their beautiful extremities in the joint bathroom. He’d watch Raquel fumble with her bra strap or Gabriel scratch a loose feather in the morning. Their light brilliance echoed unimaginable power. Then a flash of fabric, and a hoodie or leather moto jacket would securely obscure their appendages for the next seventeen hours. Peter hadn’t fully considered the impact of rooming with four ArchAngels. They had matriculated already oriented towards some set angelic métier. The House didn’t provide specialty tutors for the good entrusted in Peter.
He’d once asked Noah to describe what his wings looked like. Noah was taken aback and slightly grossed out. “They’re these butterfly-moth-monarch things. It’s fine; they’re sexy.” That hadn’t been Peter’s concern.

Let Him Hold His Finger Thus
If it hadn’t been so sudden; if he hadn’t had a creeping hangover that demanded drenching at 4 a.m.; if he hadn’t had crushes on them both separately; if the moon hadn’t shone that night; if Samson’s hair had been shorter; if Delilah’s lips had resembled cherries less—
But Peter had promised to be their rock, so he became their wall. He’d stumbled onto something young and vulnerable. Yes, Samson and Delilah might destroy one another, but if the ArchAngels found the two out, they certainly would. Peter was their rock, so he would protect and conceal. That was the good Peter did: He kept secrets.
Peter surveyed Samson and Delilah frozen under the low lavatory light, flipped them off, and returned to bed.

House Master’s Dinner
“I’m allergic to fruit, and the cheese is covered in it!” Raquel slid down the dining table ahead of Peter. The blockmates had converged on the residence like Revelations. Wasn’t the point of this to meet other people in the House? Why were they only talking amongst their seven? Why were they leaving to eat alone?
What about power creates binaries? Peter always found himself on the edge: a legacy with uncharacteristically high melanin, the angels’ gatekeeper with little influence, within and without. Raquel led them all past their inquisitive House Masters into the courtyard. It wasn’t the historical implications of the title that bothered Peter; it was its inflexibility, its inaccuracy.
He wouldn’t admit it, but he enjoyed knowing that within the ArchAngels’ dominion stood a hidden triad bearing Fruit of Knowledge. What use is mastery without secrets? Peter sat between Samson and Delilah silently eating the fruit and felt like a god.

Neverland
Noah’s fingers traced the path Peter had made from the Home Under the Ground to Wendy’s House, around to the Jolly Roger and doubling back to Mermaid Lagoon. Peter had drawn it—another Peter’s domain—in a fit of impulsive boredom. Noah’s wonder over the graphite strokes, knees precariously balanced on Peter’s desk, imbued the mural with childish significance.
He was drunk. Peter wished he were too, but he’d only had one cider. Noah splashed onto Peter’s bed and looked at him. He had impressively blue eyes.
“It’s raining.”
“It is—”
“—and it’s chilly.” His thighs drifted apart. “Keep me warm?”
Afterward, Peter traced the freckles on Noah’s back, a Gaelic puzzle in autumn moonlight, a map with no specified destination. Peter leaned into his sleeping navigator’s ear, registering his familiar woody shampoo. “Where’s it go?” Noah only snored softly.

Straight Outta
Peter wondered if his suburban, Minnesota-via-California blackness could ever be that vogue. Anyway, it was a great movie. He still felt weird about the Facebook filter.

O.J. from Concentration
“You’ve got almost all preliminary requirements knocked out for psych.”
“Okay.”
“Is that what you’re thinking?” He was thinking of the grape bruise under his collar. Noah hadn’t texted back.  Eight hours isn’t that long.
“SLS 20 was interesting.”
“Great! I’ll just lift the hold. You’re my last; you can take the leftover bagels—and orange juice!”
“Think they’ve caught onto us?” Samson sank into the beanbag, sipping his screwdriver.
Peter laughed. “I feel like we’d know if they were ready to pounce.”
“Well, we are.”
Delilah spun into the common room and kissed Samson without a thought. Peter shivered. Knowledge wasn’t sufficient; love was too blinding and vibrant. What use are secrets without darkness?

Dhall Date
“Listen, Peter… this was supposed to be the ‘me’ semester, but you’re here too and… this week was amazing, but for both our sanities, I don’t think—”

But Then
Noah: Still up? I’m watching Master of None feat Smartfood :)
Peter: Are we actually gonna finish an episode for the first time?
Noah: lol

Morning
“Sorry! I spaced out. What?” Peter was wearing Noah’s Harvard Model Congress hoodie with an SF Pride bracelet.

The foundation of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign is voters’ trust. Americans believe he’s sincere, earnest—that he’s a different kind of politician. But this trust is misplaced. Sanders is not really a different kind of politician, his election will not give rise to a different kind of political system, and Americans should trust neither our politicians nor our politics. It’s pleasant to indulge in the willful ignorance of Sanders’ candidacy, but we must be honest. The hagiographic narrative of his campaign is false.
Though he’s advocated a number of populist policy positions, Sanders is not a different kind of politician with respect to justice for the oppressed. Time and again, he has curried favor with blue-collar white voters at the expense of other  groups. He urged Democrats to deemphasize reproductive justice because Southern whites “are getting hung up on abortion.” He claims he was “19 years ahead of the curve” on LGBTQ+ issues, but he opposed same-sex marriage until 2009 and resisted basic employment nondiscrimination initiatives as the mayor of Burlington.
In 1994, Sanders voted for President Bill Clinton’s hyper-carceral crime bill. Gun violence is a matter of racial justice, but he shored up support with rural voters by opposing gun restrictions, including universal background checks. He supported the loophole that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase a pistol and kill nine people in the hate crime at Emanuel Church. And Sanders has lobbied for bald-faced environmental racism, co-sponsoring legislation for a nuclear waste disposal site in Sierra Blanca, Texas. Poor, majority-Latino Sierra Blanca was selected as the dumping site for Vermont’s radioactive waste at least in part because residents couldn’t speak English and wouldn’t understand environmental reports that were never translated into Spanish. Sanders’ record might be better than former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s, but that’s not a high enough bar—especially since he comes from one of the most liberal states in the nation. When Sanders announced his presidential campaign in Burlington, few of Vermont’s black and Latino leaders attended.
Above all, Sanders’ candidacy is premised on a dangerous mistruth about American government. When he calls our political system merely broken, Sanders pretends as though it once worked and can be fixed. In fact, it has never been just. To trust any politician is to trust a political system that was founded on oppression and that is not built for the liberation Sanders promises. Ironically, as the putative independent and self-proclaimed outsider who cut a deal with Democrats to win his seat in Congress—and as both a white man’s populist and the most progressive candidate for President of the United States—Sanders is proof of this. Revolutions unfold outside and against power structures, not within them. In selling voters on a figurative revolution, Sanders dangerously legitimizes the American political system.
There is honor and value in the difficult work of chipping away at institutionalized oppression from the inside—of minimizing violence, mitigating pain, and reducing harm in a way that is painstaking, rarely inclusive, and never systemic. If Sanders is willing to lead this kind of change, he must make that argument in those terms. Instead, he is running on a false promise and flimsy policy proposals, validating his candidacy with a purist image that isn’t borne out by the facts. Just as electing a black president couldn’t end racism, electing a candidate who isn’t funded by super PACs won’t end corporate control of American government.
Though it’s pleasant to indulge in false hope and willful ignorance, it’s unethical to let this narrative about the United States go unchallenged. Our political system isn’t broken and can’t be fixed. It’s oppressive by design. The only revolution that can end institutionalized oppression—including class-based oppression—is one that will never happen: a real one. We can make incremental, limited but meaningful change, but that’s a hard sell and one Sanders seems unwilling to make. This is unfortunate, because the most radical thing he could do is acknowledge the hard truth that our political system can never be divorced from oppression.
Sanders is not really a different kind of politician, this is not a different kind of political system, and Americans should neither trust our politicians nor our politics. Vote for him or don’t vote for him, but don’t trust Bernie Sanders.

Last week, one of my favorite rappers, Joey Bada$$, joined the ranks of other celebrities by coming to the aid of the disgraced Bill Cosby on his Twitter. Throughout his admittedly engaging lecture about his journey through the music industry, I could not help but wonder how he reconciles his positions on positivity and community uplift with his stance of the Cosby case. While Joey stops short of declaring Cosby innocent as Kanye West did, Joey equally fails to see the real issue at hand in the Cosby case. Put plainly, the way the media chooses to cover the Cosby case in no way absolves him of his actions and most certainly does not warrant the black community or any other to come to his aid. 
In many ways, I fully understand the desire to defend Bill Cosby at all costs, especially for members of the black community. Few celebrities have played as pivotal a role in shaping black culture as Bill Cosby. At a time when the black community had little, if any, hope of seeing people that looked like them on TV, Cosby gave the entire world a window into the black community. Arguably for the first time in history, a show featured a predominately black cast in a sitcom that wasn’t explicitly about blackness. The Cosbys were unapologetically black, as every lip sync performance of Ray Charles and James Brown classics captures. But that was only part of the show rather than the central focus, showing that black people had regular families with normal problems and everyday triumphs.
For those that have so many fond memories of the show, abandoning Cosby tarnishes everything the show did for us. Sure, the impact of the show remains. Without it, there likely would never have been a “Fresh Prince of Bel Air” or “Family Matters,” all shows critically important to me in my adolescence. But personally, I can’t re-watch those videos now without wondering whether Cosby attacked a woman immediately following the filming of the scene.
Admittedly, some of this has to do with his own stance on the state and faults of the black community. In his later years, Cosby continually levels a critique of the black community steeped in respectability politics. Focusing on sagging pants and poor parenting, Cosby fails to acknowledge the true causes of the plight of the black community. At no point did this line of logic seem compelling in light of the numerous institutional barriers to success for the black community, but now it rings even more hollow. The entire premise of his argument rested upon the assumption that he held the moral high ground in every part of his life, the Platonic form of the family man. A man accused—and probably guilty—of perpetrating scores of rapes and sexual assaults has less than zero ground to complain about how black men wear their pants.
Despite exhaustion and mental strain, Kanye does not get a pass for proclaiming Cosby’s innocence. Similarly, when someone like Joey says the media has brainwashed us, implying his own innocence, I cringe. Searching for Cosby’s innocence in light of stories from over 50 women not only makes little sense but, more importantly, devalues the voice of women everywhere. For every Rolling Stone cover story, there are multiple women ignored by the powers that be because there is little physical evidence, their skirt was too short, or any number of other horror story scenarios.
The black community has every right to question how the media portrays our people, especially in the news. Regular character assassination of slain, unarmed black men has made the black community rightfully wary of the motives of the media.
But Cosby’s case is in no way a media issue. It is not character assassination. We are watching the public unreasonably slowly come to terms with the dark reality of a formerly beloved public figure. In reality, placing the blame on the media or the omnipresent “They” rather than simply considering the preponderance of evidence against Cosby is much closer to character assassination.
Cosby is still worthy of the Constitutional protection of presumed innocence until a jury of his peers convicts him for his transgressions. However, his legal protections do not come with comparable moral protections. At this point, claims of some grand conspiracy against this fallen hero sound more like the first topic of discussion at the semi-annual Illuminati meeting. When someone brings up Bill Cosby, taking a wait-and-see attitude is the same as saying Darren Wilson is innocent because a grand jury failed to indict him. When scores of women share similar stories of abuse, attack, and subsequent erasure, we need to listen to their stories and accept reality.

Today, the Divinity School course “World Religions Through Their Scriptures” began its first of various six month modules on edX. The class is a project developed over the past year in a collaborative effort by six professors with the lofty end of combatting religious ignorance, intolerance, and illiteracy by exploring the sacred texts of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. Indeed, in a toxic political atmosphere, a remedy for these blights is in high demand: the course is expected to welcome 50 to 100 thousand enrollees in its first module.
Overall, the intention behind this course is laudable. The calculus that drives it is simple yet potent: Ignorance begets callousness, fear, and xenophobia, whereas knowledge facilitates empathy, respect, and understanding. A person who has intimately interacted with the holy text of a religion and explored the culture that accompanies it is not apt to make gross generalizations about its followers and will be able to crack through the veneer of religious misinformation that plagues America today.
Moreover, edX—an online collaboration between Harvard and MIT—furnishes an ideal medium for the multicultural exploration and broad audience on which this religious literacy class hinges. The large expected enrollment goes far beyond the audience that Harvard could reach with any conventional undergraduate course. In addition, the course's creators hope participants themselves will represent the diverse traditions that the course studies; the course website mentions that students “will have the opportunity to interact with peers from around the world representing diverse backgrounds, affiliations, and perspectives.”
Granted, the four week modules that the course offers on each tradition will not make specialists out of participants or even delve considerably into the rich nuances of each tradition. Such an expectation, however, would be unreasonable and would ignore this course’s true intent: It addresses the basic need for well-informed citizens to understand the world’s religions and gain a working knowledge of each, and promotes a spirit of inquiry and deference that will enable its graduates to interact sensibly with different religions. These skills will serve students well even without an encyclopedic knowledge of each faith.
This course is also a reminder of the importance of religious diversity among Harvard undergraduates, a kind of diversity that is not fully addressed in conversations about inclusion at Harvard. Despite this inattention, religious diversity is no less crucial to Harvard’s mission of preparing students to be citizens of the world than diversity of any other kind. The College would do well to promote more discourse about religion during such formative times as freshman orientation and Community Conversations. Harvard students are not immune to prejudices or misconceptions about religion, and these prejudices about such a central and particularly sensitive aspect of people’s lives can be insidious and divisive to a community.
In sum, the Divinity School’s initiative accentuates the indispensability of a basic appreciation of the world’s religious traditions for any well-educated person. It is a responsibility and a privilege for humans to be able to contemplate and explore rich traditions accumulated over millennia; it would be a crisis for us not to do so.

UPDATED: March 1, 2016, at 12:13 a.m.
Harvard jointly filed an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board on Monday arguing against the unionization of graduate students, joining six other Ivy League universities, Stanford, and MIT in a call for the board to uphold existing rulings that define the relationship between private universities and graduate students as strictly academic.
In an email sent to faculty members, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng wrote, “Along with our peer institutions, we share the concern that introducing labor unions into this educational relationship would disrupt academic programs, administration of financial assistance, and infringe upon academic freedom.”
Last April, a group of graduate students at Harvard made public their unionization efforts, and last week leaders of that group indicated that their movement had gained support from the majority of graduate students who work across Harvard as teaching fellows or research assistants.
In 2004, the NLRB ruled that graduate students at Brown University were not employees, meaning that federal union protections would not apply to them. Currently, two cases brought separately by graduate students at Columbia and The New School are under review by the NLRB and could stand to alter the relationship between private universities and their graduate students.
The brief, filed jointly by nine universities at the solicitation of the NLRB for the Columbia case, comes while graduate students across the nation—including at Harvard—push for their universities to recognize them as employees with the right to collectively bargain.
The brief emphasizes the strong stance Harvard has already taken against unionization, arguing that the formation of a graduate student union would fundamentally change the relationship between graduate students and universities to one based in labor, not in education, and that such a move could “transform the collaborative model of graduate education to one of conflict and tension.” University President Drew G. Faust has made clear her opposition to unionization on similar grounds.
“Both collective bargaining and arbitration are, by their very nature, adversarial,” the brief states.
GSAS administrators sent students an email late Monday afternoon announcing the filing of the amicus brief and reiterating their stance against unionization. The Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers posted on its Facebook page that members “are disappointed in the administration's continued interference with our democratic process and their refusal to recognize or respect the majority of graduate workers who have openly called for a union.”
For some students, the filing represents a shift in Harvard’s strategy regarding the unionization effort. In October, GSAS administrators issued guidelines on how to respond to the movement—welcoming discussion but discouraging hostility.
“So far, it feels like the administration has been running a pretty dainty, gentle anti-union campaign, and we expected it to get more aggressive and we couldn’t predict the form that it would take exactly,” Ph.D. student Abigail Weil, a member of the unionization effort, said.
John T. Trumpbour, research director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, said he thought the University’s move was not surprising.
“I think that the private universities really feel that they are at a turning point, so a lot of them really want to do as much as they can to stop these victories now, and this they see as a very crucial decision,” Trumpbour said. He added that if a Democrat is elected the next U.S. President in 2016 and the NLRB rules in favor of graduate students, it could be difficult for a future board to reverse that decision.
Weil said she disagreed with the brief’s claim that collective bargaining is inherently contentious.
“We’re not trying to be adversarial or have any animosity towards our employers,” Weil said. “We want to come to the table as equals.”
Chamith Y. Fonseka, a Ph.D. student and a member of the unionization effort, wrote in an email that he is “particularly disappointed in the administration because - contrary to the University’s claims - efforts like these are exactly what creates an adversarial relationship between the administration and student body.”
Much of the brief focused on the threat a union could pose to academic freedom. The brief described a hypothetical situation in which a professor wants to change the format of a final exam from multiple-choice to an essay, and, as a result, a graduate student union files a formal grievance charging that the change could create extra work for teaching fellows.
The brief also cites issues that have surfaced at New York University, the only private institution that has voluntarily recognized a graduate student union, such as grievances filed over the selection of teaching assistants.
“Given the experience of NYU, it is a near certainty that the advent of bargaining with graduate assistants will irrevocably damage graduate education in the private sector, and potentially undergraduate education as well,” the brief states.
The brief also states that the process of filing grievances against faculty could have an “enormous and psychologically destructive” impact on graduate students and faculty.
Trumpbour said he disagrees that unionization would be harmful to graduate education. As a Ph.D. student at Harvard in the ’90s, he said representation could have made it easier to voice his opinions without being singled out.
The brief added that the relationship between university and student cannot be separated into “distinct spheres” of employee and student. But Weil said such a distinction is not necessary.
“We don’t feel that being an employee and being a student are mutually exclusive categories,” Weil said.
The brief—which Weil called an “11th hour decision”—was filed on the last day the NLRB allowed submissions from interested parties. Responses to the amicus brief must be filed by March 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Parents and family members of 12 first-generation College students flew into Cambridge on Harvard’s dime this Junior Parents Weekend to record interviews with their children. These recordings will soon be made available in the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.
A collaboration between the Bureau of Study Counsel and StoryCorps, a national oral history organization, the project was born out of a desire to share and preserve the experiences of Harvard’s first-generation students, according to BSC Associate Director Sheila M. Reindl. 
“For first-generation to college students, there’s such a needed interest in knowing more about that experience, and we really wanted to make a place to invite, hear, preserve, and share those stories,” Reindl said.
The 12 undergraduates who participated were each allowed to fly in one parent, family member, or teacher, whose travel and living expenses were subsidized by the College and a private donor.
For Samwel M. Emmanuel ’17, the opportunity to bring his mother all the way from Tanzania was too good to pass up.
“It was a great weekend because I spent all of it with my mom, whom I hadn’t seen for over two years,” Emmanuel said. “For my mom, it was her first time ever out of the country.”
After settling in, parents and family members sat down at the BSC with their students to talk about both generations’ educational experiences. For some participants, the exchange was an intense one.
“I got really emotional because we talked about everything we’d been through; my mom talking about what it was like growing up, and me talking about everything I’ve been through at Harvard,” Gabby D. Aguirre ’17 said. “It felt relieving—it felt like therapy.”
For participants like Selena S. Rincon ’17, the interview, conducted as a conversation between parent and child, revealed parts of their lives that she and her mother didn’t know about each other.
“It was a great opportunity to talk to my mom about a lot of things that I hadn’t gotten to talk to her about,” Rincon said. “It really started a conversation with my mom that needed to happen.”
According to Rincon, she and her mother spoke in depth for the first time about the challenges Rincon has faced as a first-generation student.
“I don’t want to tell my mom, oh yeah, I’m having a rough day today,” Rincon said. “Some of these things are difficult to handle because I don’t want her to worry.”
William A. Greenlaw ’17 said the interview offered him an opportunity to learn more about his father, who was rejected from a college and ended up working at a steel mill instead.
“My father expressed a little bit of regret about that during the interview,” Greenlaw said. “It was very illuminating to finally understand why he’s been so encouraging; perhaps if he’d been encouraged more, or had been given advice on how to handle failure early on, then maybe things would have been much different.”
Many participants who were interviewed said they hoped their experiences, shared through StoryCorps and the BSC, could offer future first-generation students guidance and stories with which they may identify.
“I really just hope that if people hear the conversation, they can connect with it and know that they’re not alone in struggling,” Aguirre said.

In a few weeks, Harvard students who frequent downtown Boston on weekends will no longer be able to ride the T back to campus after midnight.
The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority voted unanimously to cut late night T service on weekends at a Fiscal and Management Control Board meeting Monday afternoon. The cuts will end T service after midnight on Friday and Saturday nights, and are slated to take effect on March 18. Currently, the T stops operating at 2:00 a.m. on weekend nights. 
Declining ridership, limited time for maintenance, and a ballooning budget deficit all contributed to the Board’s 4-0 decision to shutter the service.
The decision and other cost-cutting measures are part of a larger effort to shrink the MBTA’s deficit. Transit officials toured the Greater Boston area in recent weeks to give presentations on proposed reductions in service, which would help curb the organization’s projected $242 million deficit. The MBTA announced Monday that the new projected budget for the 2017 fiscal year would have a $134 million deficit, reflecting over $104 million in saving measures.
In January, Cambridge residents and city officials expressed concern that cuts to late night service would not only make weekend excursions difficult for college students, but also economically hurt those who work night shifts.
Harvard students and alumni who ride the T also questioned whether cutting late night service was the correct move for the MBTA.
The changes will disproportionately affect the Harvard Square T stop compared to other stations. An MBTA report from last February found Harvard Square was the 4th busiest station during late night hours.
The MBTA claimed in its presentation that cuts would not stifle evening transportation, but rather shift the burden to taxis and ride-sharing services. Such a move has the potential to escalate growing competition between taxi drivers and ride-sharing services like Uber.

Joining the voices of the Harvard University Choir at morning services, Harvard Divinity School students will reflect upon their experiences as BGLTQ-identifying individuals at Memorial Church’s Morning Prayers this week.

Titled “The Queer Divine: Perspectives and Theologies from LGBTQ Lived Experiences,” the series of services celebrates and examines the intersections between queer identity and religion in the week leading up to the graduate student-led LGBTQ Conference on Saturday.
Denson Staples, the Divinity School’s Queer Rites coordinator who helped to organize the Morning Prayers series, said this week’s prayers will encourage people to reflect on the relationships between those with “non-normative” identities and their place within faith traditions.
“There’s not always such a simplistic tension between communities of faith and being queer,” Staples said. “I think we’ve often constructed this idea that if you’re queer, there’s not a lot of space for you in religious communities, and that religious communities can be too intolerant of queer identities. Nevertheless, there are millions of Americans who are living at the center of both of those things.”
Memorial Church fellow Alanna C. Copenhaver, who worked with Staples in organizing the “Queer Divine” series, said Memorial Church is increasingly welcoming of all speakers’ beliefs, despite its official affiliation as a Protestant church.
“We try really hard to create a welcoming space where anyone can… share what’s on their heart and mind,” Copenhaver said. “We get a really interesting and wonderful cross-section of Harvard life and people who make up Harvard life and the Harvard community.”
Adrianne E. Vincent, a Divinity School student who delivered Monday’s prayer, shared the experience of being a war and civil rights activist, feminist, and lesbian.
“I was told I was the black sheep of the family,” Vincent said. “How many of us in the LGBTQ community have heard these words? Black sheep. You don’t fit.”
Vincent also spoke about examining the past to better understand oneself and relationships with others.
“How can we be both responsible and responsive to our historic inheritance?” Vincent said. “Recognizing our deep interconnectedness with others offers a rich understanding of our individual lives in relation to lives and histories of our friends and communities.”
Lindsey Franklin, another Divinity School student, said Vincent’s talk offered a unique perspective.
“So many stories are about the future. I loved the reframing about looking at the past for inspiration and the stories that might not have been told,” Franklin said.
Staples shared personal hopes that this week’s Morning Prayers series leading up to the LGBTQ Conference will not only become a tradition, but also inspire similar discussions about religion and social issues, such as race and socioeconomic status.
“I think the work doesn’t begin or stop with queerness,” Staples said. “I think we have a lot more to do, and I hope that this will be part of a much broader effort within the Harvard community, but also our broader world, to think more intentionally about these topics and how they’re all interconnected.”

The first administration of the revised SAT exam will take place this Saturday, and college admissions experts remain unsure as to whether students have been able to adequately prepare for the new test.
Some college consultants have gone so far as to steer students away from the SAT and towards its competitor, the ACT, fearing the chaotic period of transition could hurt some students’ exam performance.
“We have been advising students to switch over to the ACT, and I think that’s still the best advice for now,” said Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting. “Once the new test is out and people take it, and test prep is all caught up, then we might recommend that people go back to taking whichever test plays more to their strengths.”
This perceived shift to the ACT is taking place despite agreement among some college admissions observers that part of the reason for creating the new SAT was a desire to make it more similar to—and competitive with—the ACT. The SAT, long the most popular college entrance exam in the U.S., was surpassed by the ACT in number of test-takers for the first time within the past five years.
David C. Mainiero, co-founder and director of operations at InGenius Prep, said the College Board, which develops the SAT, may be attempting to “co-opt the popularity of the ACT.”
In developing the new exam, the College Board has removed many difficult vocabulary words, “concentrating much more on the basic skills, like being able to read a passage and understand what it’s about,” according to Parke P. Muth, a former associate dean of admissions and director of international admissions at the University of Virginia.
In a statement, Harvard Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 expressed his support for the changes.
“The College Board has done a great deal of research in constructing the new SAT in a way that will focus on aspects of English and mathematics and will be particularly important for successful college academic work and in the world beyond college,” he said.
The new SAT also features a revamped essay, which will require students to analyze documents the College Board deems historically influential, including “founding documents” such as the U.S. Constitution and the writings of Martin Luther King Jr. The new essay, unlike in previous iterations of the test, will be optional. Only a few colleges and universities, including Harvard, will require the essay component of the test.
“Because the previous writing test was one of many predictors of academic performance, we hope the new test may be helpful as well,” Fitzsimmons said. “We also believe that it is very important for Harvard to take part in this experiment given the importance we place on writing.”
Those arguments notwithstanding, Muth said the College Board has continued to receive criticism from those concerned that scores obtained on the new exam might be hard to compare with old results. Others, he said, fear that scores might go down across the board.
Mainiero suggested that much of the anxiety over the revised test may arise from the fact that there are only four publicly released practice tests for the new SAT.
“People feel safe when they have a whole repository of past tests and practice questions to go through tried-and-true strategies,” Mainiero said. “When people don’t have that kind of cushion to fall back on, they get kind of anxious.”

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a dual degree music program and on new legislation for the College’s program in General Education at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, according to the meeting agenda obtained by The Crimson.
The proposed dual degree program between Harvard’s Music Department and the Berklee College of Music would mirror the partnership already in place between the University and the New England Conservatory.
Over the course of five years, students enrolled in the Harvard-Berklee program would receive a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard and a Master of Music from Berklee in fields including music technology, digital production, global music, and jazz performance, Music professor Ingrid Monson said in an interview last month. If approved, the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—would review the program five years after its inception.
At January's faculty meeting, some professors raised questions about the proposal, citing the costs of niche academic programs that may prevent underprivileged students from enrolling.
On Tuesday, members of FAS also will vote on the legislation of the revamped Gen Ed program, a discussion that has been prolonged since a committee reviewing the current requirements deemed the program “failing on a variety of fronts” in May 2015.
If approved, the new system—which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris presented at January’s faculty meeting—would require students to take courses in four new Gen Ed categories, fulfill a distribution requirement, and complete one numerical reasoning-based course.
A standing committee will review courses that count for the Gen Ed, distribution, and the mathematical requirements. Additionally, the standing committee will determine “the scope and parameters” of the math requirement, according to the proposed legislation outlined in Tuesday’s meeting agenda.
Visual and Environmental Studies professor Robb Moss will also introduce a proposal to transfer a current doctoral program in Film and Visual Studies from the purview of a standing committee to the VES department.
“The interdisciplinary and formally experimental aspects of the program have not only put the [Film and Visual Studies] program on the cutting edge of film and media scholarship, but woven it more tightly into the VES department over time,” the proposal reads.  “The current Standing Committee arrangement does not reflect this reality on the ground, causing confusion both within Harvard and beyond it.”
Faculty will not vote on this proposed change until next month’s faculty meeting, at the earliest.
At the Faculty Council’s bi-weekly meeting last week, members voted on the VES proposal and also heard presentations on “diversity in the College and on graduate student unionization,” according to a Harvard press release.

Harvard's Office for Sustainability, previously located east of the College's campus, has moved to 14 Story St. in Harvard Square, bringing it closer to Harvard Yard and increasing its accessibility to students.


Heather A. Henriksen, the director of the sustainability office, said that although the previous building, located at 46 Blackstone St.,  was a preeminent example of sustainability on campus, its distance from the Square, nearly a 20 minute walk, hindered the office from fulfilling its mission of connecting with students.
“We really wanted a space for students who were interested in sustainability to come talk to us, where we could bring, in particular, students, but also other community members, together,” Henriksen said.
The Story Street building, which is currently being renovated to house the office, features designs focused on minimizing waste, promoting health and well-being, and fostering collaborative spaces. The office is outfitted with secondhand furniture, and an environmentally-friendly carpet, paint, and other equipment, according to Henriksen.
Brainstorming for the renovations, most of which took place over winter break, featured input from faculty and staff from the Green Building Services, the Innovation Lab, and the Sustainability Office itself.
“We probably moved in and fitted out this space much more cheaply than your average office does,” Henriksen said. “All it took was a bit more resourcefulness to source reused furniture.”
According to Henriksen, the new location reflects the office’s values by providing an example of sustainable living—addressing energy and greenhouse gas emissions and building healthy, productive spaces for people.
“It’s really important for us to make sure our space aligned with the intention of our mission, which is to be a living lab, to institutionalize the best practices in sustainable operations, and really amplify our impact through all of our partnerships with students, faculty, staff, and community members,” Henriksen said.
According to Colin B. Durrant, a spokesperson for the Office for Sustainability, the building will serve as a convening space for Harvard’s sustainability managers, student leaders, and staff.
“We want to create a space that could be another space for students working on sustainability projects,” Durrant said. “If you’re a student working with a group on a sustainability project, whether it be an entrepreneurial thing or whether it be a class project, this could be it.”
Although it is already open to students, the office anticipates “ramping up” student involvement in late March or early April after it completes the renovation of its building, according to Durrant.
“We hope to have some focus groups and figure out from students what they need and want, and how we can really make this space in our office in better service of [them],” Henriksen said.

Two mumps cases have been confirmed across Harvard’s student body, according to an email sent Tuesday evening by Paul J. Barreira, director of Harvard University Health Services.
An undergraduate student and a graduate student at the Divinity School have contracted the virus, according to Barreira. In his email, Barreira encouraged students to take preventative measures against the virus through standard sanitary practices like handwashing and abstaining from food sharing.
Mumps is a viral illness that affects the salivary glands, and presents itself through symptoms like ear ache, jaw pain, fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. Symptoms of the virus can be alleviated through fever and pain reduction treatments.
According to Barreira, students who have been vaccinated can still be infected by the virus, though they are much less likely to contract it.
Barreira wrote that HUHS has contacted the Cambridge Public Health Department and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and was making accommodations for the students who had tested positive for mumps. He added that the Public Health Department is currently determining the scope of potential exposure of the virus to other affiliates of the University.
“Under the direction of the Public Health Department, those who have been diagnosed with mumps or presumptive mumps (while they are awaiting test results) will be advised to self-isolate for five days after the onset of parotid swelling,” Barreira wrote. “Accommodations are being made for those individuals to minimize exposure to others.”
Charlene M. Reese, a parent of the class of 2016, posted on the Harvard Parents Class of 2016 Facebook page she said she administers in order to alert other parents of the outbreak.
“In situations like this it is essential for parents to not feel alone and to be able share their knowledge and experiences,” Reese wrote in an emailed statement.
Barreira included medical resources in his email, including a link to more information about mumps and phone numbers to contact if symptoms arise.

Panera Bread customers were stunned and devastated to learn the bakery-cafe chain had abruptly closed its Harvard Square location Monday.
Eager customers were greeted this week not with the sweet scent of cinnamon buns but rather with a typed note taped to Panera’s door stating, “This Panera cafe is permanently closed as of Monday, 2/29. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this has caused you.” 
Panera has occupied the storefront at 1288 Massachusetts Avenue, in the heart of Harvard Square, since it opened its doors in 2012.
Undergraduates were shocked and disappointed to hear the news.
Michael A. Kikukawa ’17 was unaware of Panera’s closing when he ordered dinner through the restaurant’s mobile app. Only after completing his order did Kikukawa realize that it was being fulfilled at Panera’s Porter Square location.
“I was horrified,” Kikukawa said. “I quickly called the restaurant and canceled the order, but spent the next five minutes trying to order a meal at what I thought was Panera's Harvard Square location.”
After giving up and walking over to vegetarian restaurant Clover in defeat, Kikukawa, a Harvard for Hillary member, said the news hit him particularly hard when he remembered he and his friends frequent Panera after every Harvard for Hillary phone bank the group holds.
“I almost cried,” Kikukawa said. “Now what am I going to eat at Harvard for Hillary phone banks every week?”
Other students said they’ll miss the eatery for its warm environment and friendly service. Jacob N. Russell ’19 said it’s a “real bummer” that Panera is closing, and fondly recalled how staff compensated him for a mistaken order.
“One time they accidentally messed up my order, but then they gave me a gift card in return,” Russell said. Russell added that he received a $100 gift card to Panera over the holiday, and regrets he will now never be able to use it at the Harvard Square location.
The bakery-cafe chain offered a wide variety of foods, and featured a “Pick 2” option that allowed students to combine various options into one meal for a reasonable price. However, Brenda M. Chiang ’19 said she will miss Panera’s signature bread bowls the most.
“Where will I get macaroni in a breadbowl now?” Chiang said.
Some students were particularly struck by the lack of prior notice on an otherwise sunny Monday.
“As it stands, my last Panera visit was three days ago, and I would have taken more time to appreciate the meal had I known it were my last,” Halle A. Orr ’16 said. “We can make it through this tragedy. Maybe.”
However, not everyone took the news as a loss. Gaby Germanos ’18 said she was saddened but not surprised to hear of the closing, saying she found staff sometimes unfriendly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An ongoing lawsuit that alleges Harvard discriminated against a former associate professor on the basis of gender has now provoked a broader dispute about the confidentiality of the University’s  tenure process.
In early February, a federal court declined to issue a protective order that would have allowed Harvard to redact the names of internal and external participants in the tenure review process of Kimberley Theidon.
Theidon, formerly an associate professor of Anthropology at Harvard, filed a lawsuit in the Massachusetts District Court against the University last March alleging she was denied tenure for advocating for victims of sexual assault and on the basis of her gender. That complaint characterized her unsuccessful candidacy for tenure as “retaliation” by Harvard that violated anti-sex discrimination Title IX and anti-employment discrimination law Title VII.
Harvard had requested in an October motion that the confidentiality of the individuals reviewing Theidon's tenure case—16 external scholars and 13 members of Harvard’s Anthropology department—be protected, arguing that undermining that confidentiality would undermine the tenure review process’ reliability.
In the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, after a seven- to eight-year track, every tenure case ends in an ad hoc committee meeting chaired by the President and Provost of the University. The Dean of FAS, the divisional dean, and the Senior Vice Provost on Faculty Diversity and Development sit on the committee ex officio.
They are joined by two area experts from departments within the same division and three from outside Harvard to review letters from scholars inside and outside the University. In the letters, scholars are asked to evaluate the candidate’s scholarship and compare the candidate to “comparands”—other scholars in the candidate’s field of research.
Harvard’s memo proposed redacting the names of these scholars and the “comparands” in the letters and disclosing the names of those on the ad hoc committee on an “attorneys’ eyes only” basis—a measure typically reserved for trade secrets.
In a document opposing the motion, Theidon’s legal counsel argued that such confidentiality would “blind” Theidon. The memo said the motion would prevent her from proving—by comparison with the “comparands”—that she deserved tenure; render the external letters “negligible,” as the recommendations in those letters carry weight primarily based on the authority and expertise of the writer; and make proving any biases on the ad hoc committee difficult.
Both parties, according to court filings, agree that public disclosure of these documents should be prohibited. 
The court declined Harvard’s motion on Feb. 4, stating that Theidon’s personal access to unredacted versions of the tenure review materials is necessary  to her case. The names of her reviewers will be replaced by pseudonyms in public court filings.
In an emailed statement, FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote that Harvard appreciates that the court recognized the central role confidentiality plays in the tenure process and that it ordered Theidon’s counsel not to publicly reveal the identities of those who commented on her candidacy.
“But we wish he had gone further: acknowledging that confidentiality is critical to candid assessments is not enough if the court allows professors denied tenure to break this confidentiality by simply filing a lawsuit—even one, like this one, that is completely without merit,” Cowenhoven wrote. “Because there is surprisingly little case law about this issue, we think it’s an area where greater clarity is needed.”
In a Feb. 17 memorandum, Harvard attorneys asked the District Court to certify the question of whether or not the motion for a protective order should have been declined.
“If the Court’s order stands, the harm cannot be undone,” the memorandum reads. “The identity of the scholars who provided assessment of plaintiff’s scholarship will have been disclosed to the tenure candidate. That bell can never be unrung.”
Harvard’s response characterizes the court’s decision as having “far-reaching consequences,” potentially setting a precedent that Harvard says may undermine the integrity of the tenure review process for all research universities.
“I can imagine that external reviewers would be less inclined to participate in Harvard's tenure process if they knew that the considerable time they spend evaluating candidates for tenure may indeed be for naught—as would be the case if Harvard simply bypassed the reviews and made their decision based upon discrimination or retaliation,” Theidon wrote in an emailed statement.
Theidon herself filed a motion to compel Harvard to produce relevant electronic information—including emails—possessed by eight individuals: among them, three tenure-track faculty members in the Anthropology department who could be considered “comparators,” a tenured Anthropology professor, Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, and University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides.
According to the February court order, Theidon was interested in knowledge Nohria could have about Harvard’s awareness of women’s disadvantage in the tenure process and possible response measures, as well as documents related to her allegations.
On Feb. 16, Nohria submitted a signed affidavit written to support Harvard’s motion to reconsider Theidon’s request, stating that his understanding of barriers in the tenure process was limited to the Business School and was not transferrable to FAS. The affidavit also states that he “played no role” in Theidon’s tenure process and therefore has no relevant documents.

When Harvard and its largest employee union last came together to negotiate a contract, the process extended eight months past the expiration date of their contract. Protests by student groups and union workers highlighted the union members’ exasperation and frustration with the University.
This time, the process was much more amicable. Indeed, the negotiations were lengthy and, at times, strained, but members from both sides of the table agreed they ended up with a contract that was satisfactory for both sides. The finalized contract came in late January, and the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers officially ratified it last week.
In order to foster a cooperative relationship with Harvard, it was important to frame the negotiation’s outcome in a “way that doesn’t make it look like somebody’s winning and somebody’s losing because that’s never going to be productive,” Donene Williams, a member of the negotiation team for HUCTW, said.
Yet, by the time both sides arrived upon a mutually acceptable agreement, four months had passed since the expiration of the previous 2013 contract. More than 95 percent of HUCTW members who cast their ballots voted  in favor of the contract’s adoption last Thursday.
Though this year’s conversation was long, sometimes riddled with frustrations and other times with rewarding compromises, HUCTW members said this process was decidedly less antagonistic than previous negotiations.
The working relationship between HUCTW and Harvard has improved substantially and dialogue between the two parties has become more cooperative—enough so that HUCTW members are optimistic at the outcome of future negotiations.
A PROLONGED PROCESS
The year of negotiations was marked by debate over wage increases and health benefits—the latter becoming so contentious that Harvard and HUCTW appointed outside mediators to facilitate discussions.
Both sides formally met more than 40 times over the course of the year, according to a Harvard press release. Carrie Barbash, a HUCTW union organizer, said the meetings typically lasted a minimum of two hours each, and took place twice a week during the spring and the fall in rooms at 124 Mt. Auburn St.
Amanda H. Wininger, a union member who works in Widener Library, said she had to allot “four hours a week of standing meetings in [her] calendar for months and months.”
Individuals from both sides sat across from each other at a table to negotiate, and they had “secondary rooms set aside where, if we needed to caucus—talk to our teams—we could,” Barbash said.
At times, the conversations became tense, and the smaller rooms were helpful when the negotiators needed to regroup.
“If we were frustrated with one another, sometimes it made sense to sort of separate and have the mediators sort of, well, mediating between us,” Barbash said. “And then we can react to things without them having to see it, because those reactions can sometimes upset people. Plus, your initial reaction isn't always what you come around to.”
Roughly 18 to 20 HUCTW members were part of the union’s negotiating team, and each individual had a specialized role. For example, Wininger  focused on wage increases, while Williams and Susan M. Kinsella focused on health care.
Thanks in large part to a recent controversy over non-union employees’ health benefits, debate over health care often eclipsed other topics of discussion. Several HUCTW members said they were concerned about potentially receiving a similar package to what Harvard offered non-union employees in 2015. In 2014, non-union employees—many of whom were faculty members—primarily criticized the plan for its deductibles and copayments.
Harvard and HUCTW began by discussing each party’s general interests and specifying contract details as their conversations evolved. Harvard wanted a healthcare plan they could give to the majority of their employees; HUCTW sought one without the deductibles included in Harvard’s non-union package. The result: a prolonged process.
“It wasn’t just a simple conversation of the University saying ‘Here, we’d like to take this’ and us saying ‘no thanks,’ Williams said. “It was a lot more nuanced than that. There was a lot of discussion about why the University believed it would be a great idea for everyone to be on the same plan, and we didn’t disagree with that—we just didn’t believe that it was the right plan.”
Because of disagreement over health care, negotiations stagnated. As the expiration date of the previous contract from 2013 loomed ever closer, both sides called in mediators from Harvard and MIT to resolve debates over procedural items and expedite the negotiations process, Bill Jaeger, the Executive Director of HUCTW said.
The departure of Harvard's director of labor relations, Bill Murphy, in the middle of negotiations complicated the negotiations, Williams said.
Preparation for union negotiations itself was an extensive process. Both HUCTW and Harvard sought the expertise of consultants in health care and living standards prior to formal negotiations, according to Jaeger and Katie N. Lapp, Harvard’s executive vice president. Harvard initially focused on data collection, “including national and regional health-care and labor costs and trends,” Lapp wrote in an emailed statement.
Additionally, Barbash said, union representatives met individually before negotiations officially began in order to plan their discussion strategies.
HUCTW leaders sent a survey to union members in May and June 2015 to better understand  their health care and wage concerns. In a report of the survey’s findings, individuals who led the negotiations wrote that they “have been using the stories and statistics from the survey to shape and strengthen” their discussions with Harvard.
As negotiations progressed, conversations about specific policies became more pointed, Jaeger said.
“At some point, probably in the fall, we moved past the sort of carefully designed and planned early phase of the conversations into a period where the disagreements were sharper, and the ideas being put forth by the two sides were more specific,” Jaeger said.
A HIGH STAKES GAME
Both stakeholders had to take into consideration the various constituencies they represented when negotiating. Harvard negotiates with nine unions and more than 6,000 unionized employees, while HUCTW must juggle the individual interests of each of its 4,600 members.
For Harvard, negotiations can become especially complex because the University cannot disproportionately allocate more financial resources for one union’s benefits package than for others.
In the negotiations, HUCTW members wanted to ensure that the deductibles included in Harvard’s recent non-union health benefits package—which union member  Danielle R. Boudrow described as the “most dangerous part” of the plan—were not included in their new contract. Ultimately, Harvard offered HUCTW a package absent of any deductibles with a new premium contribution tier for employees whose salaries fall below $55,000, and featuring moderately increased copayments. Union members largely praised the contract.
Lapp wrote that Harvard tried to consider the increases in health care and living costs while also providing “strong wage and benefits packages to all employees in ways that also support our fundamental mission of research, teaching and learning.”
Though union members said they were at times frustrated with the length of the whole process, they said they would rather have a satisfying contract than an incomplete contract that was hastily agreed upon.
“It's more important to get the best possible agreement rather than the fastest agreement,” Boudrow said.
Under the new contract, a typical HUCTW employee will receive a 3.4 percent annual pay increase—an element similar to the previous contract with Harvard. Pay increases are scheduled for Oct. 2016 and 2017, and union members will receive retroactive pay increases for 2015.
Sarah E. Hillman, a HUCTW member and employee at the Harvard Medical School, said the contract’s wage increases were especially important because of the rising costs of living in Boston.
“I need a wage that can keep up with what it costs me to live in this area,” Hillman said.
Overall, HUCTW members said the negotiation process was positive. Williams said she believes the increased collaboration the parties saw this year will aid future negotiations.
“It’s a relationship, so what we do together in the next two and half years, that’s really going to be what helps us have a smooth negotiation process next time around,” Williams said.
When asked if there was anything that could be improved about the negotiation process, Williams laughed: “We could just agree on things sooner.”
“We were so far apart at the end of September, that it wouldn’t have been worth it to agree then just to meet the deadline,” Williams added.
Though negotiations extended past the deadline, there are still details to be worked out, including stronger language for guiding discussions about flexibility with employers and provisions addressing the union members’ parking and transportation concerns.
“We have a little bit of unfinished business, but we don’t usually, when we have unfinished business, wait three years to talk about it,” Wininger said. “We keep the conversation going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Title IX and sexual assault discussions dominate campus discourse, Harvard-affiliated religious groups sponsored an event Monday emphasizing an angle they feel has been missing from the conversation: the role of religious groups and faith in supporting victims of sexual assault.
The event, titled “Sexual Assault, Faith, and Healing,” featured a panel discussion moderated by University Chaplain Lucy A. Forster-Smith, who said she is herself a victim of sexual assault. The interfaith panel included “survivor advocates,” religious leaders, and a legal expert. 
Panelists and attendees shared personal stories of sexual assault during the conversation, which lasted for over an hour and focused on how religion and campus groups can facilitate healing.
“Tonight we’re really here to have a very different type of conversation… [about] the possibility and potential for the way that healing and wholeness can come particularly with the support of religious communities,” Forster-Smith said. “Sometimes that voice can get sort of sidelined.”
Omobolaji O. Ogunsola ’10, one of the panel’s organizers, was disappointed by the low turnout at the event, but called the substance of the event “impactful.” Harvard Soulfood Christian Fellowship member Denzel W. Paige ’16, who described the event as “eye-opening,” said it highlighted how religious communities should approach victims without alienating them.
Organizers and attendees who graduated from the College several years ago said that robust conversations currently underway about sexual assault contrast with the silence that surrounded the issue during their time as undergraduates.
“I think there is a lot more awareness because of the Title IX suit and the federal government becoming involved,” Ogunsola said.
The panel followed a screening of The Hunting Ground, a film which has generated controversy as a group of Harvard Law School professors challenged the film’s portrayal of a sexual assault case at the Law School. While the film has garnered national attention—Lady Gaga performed her song from the soundtrack at the Academy Awards on Sunday—Law School professors have publicly argued that it is “unfair” and “misleading.”
Ogunsola said the point of showing the film was to highlight the recent wave of Title IX activism at college campuses across the country. She acknowledged that doubts surrounding the specific Law School case were “fair.”
A federal lawsuit filed by Alyssa R. Leader ’15 against the University is the latest probe into the University’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. The University overhauled its sexual harassment policy in 2014, and the Law School was found in violation of Title IX later that year.

The top-ranked Harvard women’s squash team entered the weekend having already captured its 20th Ivy League title and left New Haven with its 16th Collegiate Squash Association team national championship.
Not only did the Crimson (13-0, 7-0 Ivy) finish the season as the only team in the nation to boast an undefeated record but it also brought home the Howe Cup for the second consecutive season after triumphs over three of the nation’s top programs.
HARVARD 5, No. 2 PENN 4
The Crimson found itself in the CSA Championship for the twelfth time since 2000 when team members walked onto the courts at the Brady Squash Center for a matchup with Penn (14-2, 6-1). Led by its four seniors, the team was confident but still felt the pressure.
“We were definitely nervous and anxious about our matches, but that comes with the territory,” co-captain Saumya Karki said. “To feel such pressure before a big match is a privilege in itself. We just kept reminding ourselves that we wanted to be where we were—in the finals—and no nervous energy could take the moment away from us.”
The defending champions played the Quakers in a match that came down to the very last game.
The Crimson went 1-2 at the end of the first flight, with freshman Sophie Mehta and her older sister and sophomore Alyssa both falling in drawn-out five-game matches. Sophomore Sue Ann Yong rebounded from her loss on Saturday against Trinity to sweep her opponent in the No. 6 spot.
Senior Michelle Gemmell, who won the deciding game in last year’s final, was unable to top Penn junior Michelle Wong at the No. 5 position, falling 3-1. Junior Dileas MacGowan cut Penn’s lead to just one game with a quick 3-0 sweep.
At the No. 2 position, freshman Kayley Leonard and Penn junior Anaka Alankamony traded wins in the first two games, but Leonard took control of the match down the stretch to claim a 3-1 win and tie the match at three.
It all came down to the last flight, with the outcome of the match on the shoulders of junior Katherine Tutrone, Karki, and freshman Sabrina Sobhy. Both Tutrone and Karki had pauses in play in addition to long games being played out to 12 or 14 points. Tutrone was unable to outlast her opponent, falling 3-1, while Karki claimed a 3-1 victory to set up a showdown at the No. 1 spot.
The championship now came down to Sobhy. Emotions ran high in the match, as in all four games the lead changed constantly. The contest went down to the very last play, in which Penn freshman Reeham Salah challenged a call when Sobhy was up 10-9 in the fourth game. After Sobhy’s cross-court lob, Salah chose to call for a let, which was denied. After a match filled with displays of athleticism on both sides, Sobhy clinched the 2016 CSA team championship for the Crimson.
“There is nothing quite like it,” MacGowan said. “[it was] so much better than winning in juniors when it’s just you competing individually and for yourself.  This is why I love college squash—you fully mentally and physically exert yourself and then have the members of your team doing just the same. And then you get the result you were all working towards and then being able to celebrate it together is incredible.”
With the win, Harvard took home back-to-back championships for the second time in five years, with the first time being in 2012 and 2013. Coach Mike Way moved into fourth place on the all-time coaching Howe Cup list, capturing his fourth CSA in just six years, the shortest time span for four crowns in CSA history. Under Way, the Crimson has never placed lower than second in the team championship.
The team now trails Princeton by just one championship for most titles all-time.
HARVARD 5, TRINITY 4
It was in the semifinal round of the championships that Harvard met an old foe. Harvard has had a history of winning against Trinity (12-5, 2-0 NESCAC) in the tournament, defeating the Bantams every year but one since 2010. Trinity, fresh off winning its conference championship, was looking to avenge its loss and move one match closer to reclaiming the Cup.
The match came down to Karki’s match against Trinity co-captain Sachika Balvani, but Karki won in a sweep to send the Crimson into the championship match.
“I think it was an important win in that it gave us confidence that we could deal with high pressure and come out on top,” Karki said. “Also, it was good to sort of prepare ourselves physically and mentally before going into the finals with Penn.”
HARVARD 9,  No. 8 CORNELL 0
Fresh off its Ivy League championship last weekend, Harvard carried the momentum into its quarterfinal match against conference rival Cornell (9-9, 2-5 Ivy).
The Crimson was off to a dominant start, with a sweep of the Big Red. The team allowed eight points or fewer in each of the 27 games.
“Everyone stepped up,” MacGowan said. “You don’t need to play a level above that which we have been playing all season. You just need to step up and play the way we train, and that is what everyone did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­It must feel good to be a senior on the Harvard women’s track and field team after the action this past Saturday and Sunday.
This weekend, the Harvard women brought home their fourth straight Ivy Championship—capping off an undefeated indoor Ivy career for the team’s seniors. Meanwhile, the men tied their result from last year by rallying near the close of the meet to a fifth-place finish.
The women’s meet was highlighted by yet another dominant performance from freshman Gabby Thomas, who claimed victory in the long jump, 60-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and 4x400 meter relay. Thomas, in her first year, already holds the Ivy League records in the 60-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and the 4x400 relay.
“[Gabby] is super focused, but also is really able to enjoy [racing],” junior Jade Miller said. “I couldn’t imagine being in all the events she was in as a freshman.”
Fellow freshman Ngozi Musa, who set the top time in the prelims, finished second in the 60-meter dash final—a mere 0.03 seconds off Thomas’s winning time. Musa and Thomas have been going back and forth all season, and now own the two top times in Ivy League history.
The competition between Musa and Thomas is eerily reminiscent of the contest the previous few seasons between recently graduated Danielle Barbian ’15 and Ashley Collinsworth ’15, who finished one-two at the 60-meter dash in the two consecutive Ivy championships before this one.
Barbian and Collinsworth also previously owned the two fastest times in Ivy history, before Thomas and Musa claimed those records for themselves.
“It’s funny—like we’re just replacing [Ashley and Danielle] at the same distance,” Miller said. “[Gabby and Ngozi] compete against one another in practice and meets, but what’s really awesome is that they’re able to hug it out afterwards.”
Elsewhere, the Crimson swept the podium in the women’s 60-meter hurdles, with senior Autumne Franklin, Miller, and junior Jackie Modesett coming in first, second, and third, respectively. Miller’s time of 8.51 seconds was a personal best.
“It was really awesome to see [the sweep] happen,” Miller said. “We all went out today and did what we had to do, and that was a really awesome feeling.”
Franklin, who was named the meet’s most outstanding track athlete, also scored the gold in the 400-meter dash, beating out last year’s champion Udeme Akpaete of Cornell by almost eight-tenths of a second.
In the women’s shot put, junior two-time defending Ivy champion Nikki Okwelogu continued her dominance with a winning throw of 55’10”—almost 10 feet better than the second place throw.
Okwelogu already holds the Ivy record in the shot put, and her throw would have earned her fifth on the men’s side.
The Crimson women also claimed victory in the distance medley relay and scored a plethora of top four finishes in other events, including the mile run and 500-meter dash.
On the men’s side, Harvard landed a fifth-place finish with a total of 46 points.
“Going in, we were looking to get top four,” junior Brandon Price said. “It wasn’t looking too good for us [at the beginning]... However, we were able to rally. It’s not what we were hoping for, but we’re still pretty happy.”
Indeed, Harvard pulled off a victory in the men’s 4x800 meter relay—the second to last event of the meet—which netted ten points for the Crimson, the difference between fifth and seventh place.
The other clutch late performance came in the 5000-meter run, where Price came in big down the stretch with a second place finish.
“I saw that we were in seventh place going into the 5K…. So I just put my head down and grinded it out,” Price said.
The Crimson men also claimed gold in the triple jump, where defending champion Efe Uwaifo jumped 52’3” on the way to a new Harvard record.
Elsewhere, Harvard scored top five performances in a number of different events, including personal bests by sophomore Jay Hebert in the 60-meter hurdles and senior Mark Hill in the heptathlon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The Harvard women’s ice hockey team found itself looking at a sudden death overtime in game three of the ECAC quarterfinals against No. 9/9 Colgate after sixty minutes of hockey, needing to net one goal in order to advance to the semifinals.
Just under 15 minutes later, however, the Crimson stood dejected on the ice as the Raider faithful banged on the boards where their players were piled up. Colgate 3, Harvard 2. The Crimson’s season was over.
Rookie forward Shae Labbe’s golden goal in the extra stanza sent Starr Rink into a frenzy, as Colgate (22-8-7, 12-5-5 ECAC) clinched its second trip to the ECAC semifinals in program history with a 2-1 series victory over Harvard (17-12-3, 12-7-3). The Crimson failed to advance to the conference semifinals for the first time since 1998.
No. 9/9 COLGATE 3, HARVARD 2
With just over five minutes remaining in the first overtime period, Colgate found itself knocking on the door of Harvard co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer’s net after Crimson freshman forward Grace Zarzecki’s shot earlier in the frame clanged off of the crossbar on the other end.
A few seconds later, Raider freshman attacker Jessie Eldridge sent the puck to a wide open Labbe in the slot, who shifted to her right, dropped her shoulder and sent a rocket past Maschmeyer into the top left corner of the goal, breaking Harvard hearts and sealing the Colgate win.
“It’s the best way to win but it’s the worst way to lose,” Crimson freshman forward Kate Hallett said. “We knew we had what it takes to win that game but that’s the thing about hockey, it’s a second…It takes one second to change the game and that’s what happened. They were better for that one second.”
The game got off to a rocky start for the Crimson, as sophomore forward Megan Sullivan found the back of the net on the power play just over five minutes into the game following a checking penalty on junior forward Sydney Daniels.
It took less than eight minutes to flip the script, as Harvard potted two goals in the span of less than four minutes to gain a 2-1 advantage.
After losing a faceoff in the Colgate defensive zone, Harvard freshman blueliner Kaitlin Tse regained possession of the puck and fired a shot at the goal. Though the effort was blocked, sophomore forward Lexie Laing was there to poke the puck past Raider keeper Ashlynne Rando.
Harvard claimed the lead a few minutes later as Zarzecki redirected another shot by Tse past Rando.
With 20 minutes separating the Crimson from its 18th consecutive berth in the ECAC semifinals going into the third frame, Harvard failed to hold on as Sullivan redirected teammate Cat Quirion’s shot past Maschmeyer, evening the scoreline, 2-2, and setting up Labbe’s heroics. Maschmeyer tallied 35 saves in the loss.
HARVARD 4, No. 9/9 COLGATE 1
The Crimson bounced back from a series-opening loss on Friday, routing the Raiders 4-1 behind a brace from Daniels.
After a scoreless first stanza, Harvard claimed a 1-0 lead early in the second period, as Daniels’ power play wrist shot found the back of the net seconds after a Zarzecki effort had been disallowed. The tally was the 20th of the campaign for the junior, who scored for the fifth straight game.
Sophomore line-mate Karly Heffernan doubled the lead nine minutes later, sending a laser into the bottom corner after being set up by Daniels and senior forward Miye D’Oench.
While Sullivan pulled one back for the home team less than two minutes in the third frame, rookie forward Bradley Fusco’s first collegiate goal, which occurred on the penalty, cemented the lead for Harvard. Daniels added an empty netter late in the period for the final tally.
It was a comprehensive victory for the Crimson, who led Colgate in shots on goal, 32-20. Maschmeyer had a fairly quiet night, as the Bruderheim, Alberta native made just 18 saves.
“Our second game was huge,” Hallett said. “Coming out from Friday, a 4-1 loss was pretty tough. But even coming out of that loss we were still so confident in ourselves and our teammates and we knew we’d come out strong…. From start to finish we were all over them.”
No. 9/9 COLGATE 4, HARVARD 1
Relieving the burden on their shoulders, the Raiders broke a 15-game losing streak against Harvard with a dominant 4-1 triumph.
Colgate peppered the Harvard goal early and often, tallying 17 shots on goal in the first frame alone, part of a 40-shot effort that saw Maschmeyer forced into making 36 saves.
“There was a huge difference in the first game and the second game of energy that we had going out for each shift,” Ziadie said. “I think that was lacking in the first game.”
The early effort paid off for the Raiders, as Sullivan tallied a brace in the first stanza alone, claiming the first two goals of a five-goal weekend.
Daniels cut the lead in half in the second frame, wrapping around the net before sending a shot into the mesh. The Crimson failed to breakthrough further, however, as Colgate sophomores Breanne Wilson-Bennett and Annika Zalewski added a pair of goals in the third stanza for the final margin.

O’Hara counts many things among her talents—her impressive ability to drink Diet Coke before 10 a.m., her dogged pursuit of the position of El Jefe’s #1 customer, and her remarkable skill at napping at inopportune times. But most prominent of these talents is her questionable-at-best ESP. Check back on the first of each month for your Flyby Horoscope, courtesy of Kyle.
Hey, Harvard. I’m back with your March horoscopes. My editors have finally recognized my incredible abilities (or I’ve figured out how to post my own content — the world may never know). There are some great things in the stars this month for all signs — can you say spring break? These next two weeks, though, hold potential for serious chaos if not managed correctly. Take a look at your horoscopes for a little bit of guidance on how to navigate the coming month.
PISCES: With midterms and papers piling up, take a moment to reflect on your personal life and social relationships. While a grade is just one temporary measurement, friends are forever. Make time to reach out to your near and dear. Maybe even “grab a meal.”
ARIES: It’s going to be a good month for you, Aries. Things are coming together, and your hard work is paying off. Stay the course and finish strong on your projects that are wrapping up so that your effort doesn’t go to waste.
TAURUS: Remember to keep things in perspective. Things may be tough in the coming weeks, but you’re more than capable of handling what life throws your way.
GEMINI: Now is a time to be careful with your finances. With spring break coming up, Gemini, take care to keep track of your spending both in the Square and wherever your travels may take you.
CANCER: Communication is key to making it through this busy month. If you find yourself in a tough situation, don’t be afraid to ask for help. People want to help you, they just need to know how they can make things easier.
LEO: A change of space is in store this month. Whether that’s finding a new study spot or finally getting out of the Harvard bubble (or getting quadded), new scenery will do you good.
VIRGO: Focus on balance, Virgo. You don’t need to do absolutely everything to have a successful month. Prioritize the things that are most important to you, and only commit to new projects you’re excited about.
LIBRA: Keep holding onto the momentum you’ve built up over the past couple of months. Although it’s easy to get tired and let projects slip, if you recommit yourself, you fill find success.
SCORPIO: Now’s the time to declutter your life. Take a moment as you enter this month to evaluate which activities and relationships are fulfilling and which ones aren’t worth the effort.
SAGITTARIUS: Treat yourself, Sagittarius. You’ve been working so hard this semester; celebrate all you’ve accomplished thus far.
CAPRICORN: Work is at the forefront of your life this month, Capricorn. You may have to sacrifice some fun nights out, but it will be worth it when you get to see your projects come together successfully.
AQUARIUS: These next few weeks might be a drag, but spring break is going to give you plenty of time to rest and recuperate before the second half of the semester. Take the time to enjoy the little things.
Have a great month, Harvard. I’ll be back with more horoscopes and life advice on April 1st.
