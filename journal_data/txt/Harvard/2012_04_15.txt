After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the return of cheerful, multicolored chairs to the Yard and a line-up of lively performances by Harvard community members and outside artists, The Harvard Common Spaces Program launched last week for the 2012 season.
Each year, Common Spaces invites Harvard students, faculty, and staff to showcase their talents on the Plaza outside the Science Center and the Dudley House Patio. The program is also responsible for a number of other fixtures on the plaza, including Harvard Skate, a skating rink, and a number of popular food trucks.
Common Spaces, which was originally developed in 2008, “have not only injected a stronger sense of community, they have proven how valuable and important it is for the University to provide people with the opportunity to share and engage with each other,” University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an email.
Student performers said that Common Spaces have allowed them to reach a broader audience.
George W. Zuo ’13, president of Mariachi Veritas, a group that performed on the Plaza on Friday, said that "it’s great for us as performers because we get that exposure and the opportunity to show how versatile we are as a group—we carry huge instruments, but we can unload very quickly.”
Diego Rentería ’11-12, another member of Mariachi Veritas, said that the performances add vibrancy to Harvard’s public spaces.
“We can create spaces where people can congregate and enjoy being outside or enjoy a performance as they’re walking by," he said. "It makes the Yard much more lively and welcoming to people."
Students have also taken advantage of Common Spaces’ versatility to transform campus spaces in novel ways. Last week, the Harvard Libertarian Forum erected a free speech wall outside of the Science Center in honor of Students For Liberty’s Free Speech Week. HLF member Corinne H. Curcie ’15  said that the free speech wall’s noticeable physical presence prompted participation of the Harvard community at large.
“If we did the free speech project online, it would only get people who were interested in the idea, but because it was in such a public space, we got a diverse mixture [of participants],” Curcie said.
She also noted that installing the wall in a common space was in line with HLF’s goal of engaging students in an open and uncensored dialogue.
The Common Spaces program encourages members of the Harvard community to submit performance and activity ideas throughout the semester. This season’s events will run through April 26.
“I would love to see not only our group, but many more groups perform on mini-stages throughout Harvard,” Rentería said. “Absolutely count on us being part of Common Spaces in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 16, 2012, at 12:32 a.m.
With the help of a new mobile application, more than 100 iPhone users at Harvard are now programming the content of their dreams before they even hit the sack.
Daniel J. Nadler, a graduate student in the government department with a knack for invention, got the idea for the app, which he named Sigmund, in 2010 while he was a resident tutor in Currier House. He noticed that many of the students got little sleep, and he hoped that technology could help them optimize the sleep they did get.
His new iPhone application, which also works as a standard alarm clock, allows users to influence the content of their dreams by setting a series of pre-selected words for the app to play during the REM stage of sleep. A user selects up to five words that he would like to incorporate into his dreams and enters information about his planned sleep schedule. Before going to sleep, the user places the phone about four feet away. During the night, the iPhone softly speaks the words during REM cycles. Sigmund uses an algorithm to determine the timing of users’ sleep phases.
Nadler developed Sigmund with Yuhki B. Yamashita ’11, a former Crimson editor, and MIT student Doug Feigelson.
Feigelson, who recently won Facebook’s intercollegiate hackathon at MIT, built the application and programmed in more than 1,000 pre-recorded words.
According to Nadler, some words might be better than others at influencing the content of dreams.
“Visually strong verbal stimuli such as ‘beach,’ ‘orange tiger,’ as well as personally meaningful subjects that relate to activities, people, and places such as ‘restaurant,’ ‘girlfriend,’ ‘Paris’ are especially likely to be incorporated into your dream content during sleep,” he said.
In order to make his app, Nadler learned about the neurobiology of sleep-dependent learning from a reading-directed research group funded by the Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Initiative.
Nadler said that he has received “overwhelmingly enthusiastic” responses from users of the application. Though Sigmund costs 99 cents from Apple, Nadler offers it for free to Harvard students who email him.
"It's really fascinating in the sense that you can program your own dreams. For instance, I once put in 'running, mountains, trees, lake' and dreamt that I was running on a trail in the East Sierras," wrote Nancy Y. Xie '13, who has sampled the app, in an email. "However, it tends to work best with activities/things that you are most familiar with"
Nadler and Feigelson plan to program the app for platforms besides the iPhone in the future.
“It is quite possible that in 20 years, our own dreams will become truly controllable entertainment,” Nadler said. “They bypass the eyes completely, and while in them, we truly take them for reality. Sigmund is merely the prototype.”

An earlier version of this article said that the creation of the iPhone application Sigmund was funded in part by the Harvard Mind/Brain/Behavior Initiative. In fact, though the app's creator Daniel J. Nadler relied on science from a reading-directed research group funded by the MBB Initiative, he did not directly receive funding from the program.

Exactly 100 years ago today, on April 15, 1912, the RMS Titanic sank. More than 1,500 people died on the ship. Although it's easy to get caught up in the love story of Jack and Rose, this tragedy affected many who are closer to us (and Harvard) than we might think.
Among those who sailed on the Titanic are the following Harvard students and benefactors:
1. J. Isidor Straus, Class of 1893, who co-owned Macy's and served in the House of Representatives. His three sons built freshman dormitory Straus Hall in his memory.
2. R. Norris Williams II '16, a notable tennis player. Williams survived the sinking of the ship and went on to win his Olympic gold in 1924.
3. Francis D. Millet, Class of 1869, a painter and sculptor who directed decorations and functions for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. He was also a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and one of the founders of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
4. John Jacob Astor IV, who attended Harvard before serving as a lieutenant colonel in the Spanish American War, building the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, and writing a book. He was the wealthiest man on the Titanic.
5. Harry Elkins Widener, Class of 1907. In his memory, Widener's mother built the Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library.

Students were evacuated from Eliot House at around 1 a.m. tonight and found fire trucks outside their House. Some reported smelling smoke. After about half an hour, emergency response personnel gave students permission to return to the House.
