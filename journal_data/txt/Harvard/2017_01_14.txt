Ryan Reynolds, a producer and Golden Globe-nominated actor known for his roles in many box office hits, will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2017 Man of the Year.
Reynolds is widely known for his roles in in superhero films including “Green Lantern” and “X-Men Origins: Wolverine.” Last year, Reynolds starred as Wade Wilson in “Deadpool,”  which shattered box office records to become the highest-grossing R-rated film ever.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals cast members will honor Reynolds with a traditional roast Feb. 3, the club announced Friday. The musical comedy troupe will also award him the “Pudding Pot” at Farkas Hall, which houses their annual production. A live-streamed press conference will follow the ceremony, which the group said will be available to the public for the first time this year.
Established in 1963, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' Man of the Year Award is presented annually to performers who have made “lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.” In a press release, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals praised Reynolds’s recent acting performances and box office successes.
"We're thrilled to present Mr. Reynolds with our Man of the Year award,” Guan Chen ’17, president of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, said in the release. “And if his headline-stealing kiss with Andrew Garfield at the Golden Globes is any indication, it looks like he's getting ready for his roast."
Outside of the entertainment industry, Reynolds serves on the board of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. He made headlines in 2008 after running the New York City Marathon to raise money for the foundation in honor of his father, who suffers from the disease.
Recent recipients of the Man of the Year award include, Tom Hanks, Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford, Justin Timberlake, Neil Patrick Harris, and last year, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was the group’s 50th Man of the Year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s athletic facilities will host Chance the Rapper, Mumford and Sons, Bon Iver, and dozens of other artists at this year’s Boston Calling music festival from May 26 to 28, its organizers announced Thursday.
Forty-five performers—roughly double the festival’s normal lineup—are set to participate in the popular festival, which will span three outdoor stages at Harvard’s athletic complex in Allston. The festival has yet to release a schedule of artist performances.
Last May, Boston Calling organizers announced the event would be held at Harvard instead of Boston’s City Hall Plaza, which housed the festival since its debut in 2013.
In addition to the change of venue, the festival skipped its usual fall show in Sept. 2016 and will take place once a year starting in 2017.
The festival’s organizers said they are excited about the move to Harvard.
“Between our location and lineup, 2017 will undoubtedly be the most exciting Boston Calling yet,” Brian Appel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Boston Calling Events, said in the release. “At the same time, we remain committed to our roots and very clear on the elements that make Boston Calling so special.”
Under a rental agreement with Harvard’s Athletic Department, the festival will be held at several of Harvard's athletic fields in Allston along North Harvard St., according to the press release.
“We are pleased to provide a venue that allows Boston Calling to expand its creative programming,” said Timothy J. Williamson, Harvard’s associate director of athletics and director of athletic communications.
Organizers also said changes have allowed for more variety in programming. This year, Natalie Portman ’03—an actress, director, and Harvard College alumna known for her roles in the movies “Black Swan” and “Star Wars”—will also curate a film festival for the event.
“Moving to our new location has allowed us to expand programming of the festival to include many more of our favorite artists,” Aaron Dessner, the festival’s musical curator, said in a press release.
At the most recent festival in May, indie popstar Sia, Swedish electronic artist Robyn, and indie folk singer Sufjan Stevens were featured at the festival’s last incarnation at Boston’s City Hall Plaza.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TROY, N.Y. — By the time RPI’s Evan Tironese cleared his zone with mere seconds left in the first period, the Engineers had already accomplished the improbable. Not only had the last-place team in the ECAC held the nation’s top power-play unit off the board twice in one period; it was going to skate into the first intermission with a lead over the second-ranked team in the country.
Then things grew twice as nice.
Before the horn had a chance to sound, RPI won one final puck battle—sophomore center Brady Wiffen recovered a Tyler Moy fumble at center ice, creating a breakaway out of thin air. Wiffen walked in alone on Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen and with six tenths of a second remaining, he ripped the puck right over the goal line, setting the stage for the stunner of the season in college hockey.
Against all odds, the Engineers (4-19-1, 2-10-0 ECAC) tacked on two more unanswered goals in the final 2:18 of the second period—including another last-second score—in what amounted to a remarkable 4-0 victory over the No. 2/3 Crimson (11-3-1, 7-2-1), a team that had won its last six games and scored at least four times in each one.
“That’s a tough one,” co-captain Alexander Kerfoot said. “I think it just goes to show that every team in this league is competitive, no matter what their record [is].”
“I don’t think we were very good in some very key areas,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I would say we were not very good on the power play, we were not very good in our net, and we weren’t great finishing periods off. It’s something we’ll learn from.”
Ignoring other variables, the final score certainly screams ‘trap game’ ahead of the Crimson’s date with first-place Union on Saturday. However, Friday was no ordinary pitfall. Harvard did in fact produce 41 shots on the night—six more than its season average—and its typically deadly power-play unit went to work on five separate occasions.
But in spite of all the opportunities, the Crimson produced an egg on the scoresheet for the first time since Dec. 5, 2015 against RPI, who at that point in time had star goaltender Jason Kasdorf stopping shots for them between the pipes. Now they have a freshman, Chase Perry. But the rookie had a night to remember on Friday, logging a career-high 41 saves en route to his first collegiate shutout.
“I thought that we battled hard at times, but their goalie stood on his head, and they were the better team tonight,” Kerfoot said.
The Engineers played with a lead right from the start. A boarding call against senior defenseman Clay Anderson put the Engineers on the power play just 1:35 into the contest, and Jacob Hayhurst connected on a wrister from the right faceoff dot about a minute later to put his side in front.
The hosts continued to dominate the opening 10 minutes, but afterwards, Harvard finally began to find its rhythm. Donato said his team started playing “some pretty good hockey and had plenty of chances to tie the game up.” But an equalizer never came. RPI spoiled two Crimson power plays—including a lengthy 4-on-3—then capped the period with Wiffen’s steal-and-strike.
“Certainly the 4-on-3 two-minute kill was huge, and then obviously getting a shorty was very big,” RPI coach Seth Appert said. “And I thought it was appropriate—I thought Evan [Tironese] and Brady [Wiffen], as good of offensive players as they are, they were fantastic on our penalty kill tonight and defensively as centers. So it made sense that they got that goal.”
Once again, the Harvard response was strong—the visitors outshot the Engineers, 8-1, in the opening 10 minutes of period two. But just as before, no actual answer came. Then as the Crimson began to press, RPI started creating odd-man rushes all over the place, culminating in its third goal of the night at 17:42—a Jesper Ohrvall wrister from the left dot that made it 3-0.
“I thought we did a lot of good things and established our game again, and they come down and score again,” Donato said. “I don’t think we played our best by any means, but I thought they were opportunistic, and I thought we shot ourselves in the foot a few times.”
It looked as though that’s how the score would remain after two, but just as they did in the first, the Engineers made something out of nothing in the final seconds of a period. Despite taking a faceoff outside the Harvard zone with only 5.3 seconds left, Tironese wound up with the puck and threw it to a wide-open Jared Wilson on his left, setting up a slapshot one step inside the blue line that soared over Madsen’s shoulder.

That goal would essentially mark the end of the night for the Crimson’s top goaltender, who had a difficult 15-for-19 night in net. Freshman Cameron Gornet made 11 saves in the third period in relief.
With the loss, Harvard falls out of a tie for second place in the PairWise rankings down to fifth. The Crimson also slips four points behind first-place Union in the ECAC standings. But Saturday night, Harvard will have its chance to pull back within two in Schenectady, N.Y.
“We’ll bounce back and regroup,” Donato said.
