After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This Thursday, Feb. 27th, History airs the second season premiere of its popular television show “Vikings.” Written and created by Michael Hirst, the main premise of the show is the life and conquests of the legendary Ragnar Lodbrok. While one’s first mental image of Vikings may be of helmet-wearing, pillaging barbarians, interviews with cast members Katheryn Winnick, who plays Lagertha Lodbrok, and Clive J. Standen, who plays Rollo Lodbrok, reveal that the show seeks to provide a more accurate historical image. In doing so, viewers learn that there is depth to the violence in History's “Vikings.”
 
The first aspect that makes “Vikings” different from similar shows is that it attempts to be as factual as possible. “Michael [Hirst] took great lengths to look at Scandinavian history books from the inside and out because people don’t know that much about Vikings because the Vikings didn’t write a lot down,” Standen says. “So a lot of what we know in our Western world is documented by Christian monks and their scriptures, so a lot of it is their religious propaganda.” Winnick agrees that there was an incredible amount of time dedicated to the research for the show, from the costumes to set design to weapons. “Each department is very detailed, and so much research goes into every single piece on the show,” she says. “We work with a historian to make it as accurate as possible.”
 
Lagertha’s character also helps to set “Vikings” apart from other shows. Renowned as a shieldmaiden, Lagertha exhibits both strong physical and emotional sides that have received much critical acclaim. “Playing a female lead that is not only powerful at her home but can also fight in battle is always inspiring for young girls,” she says. “It is one of those things where when you read the script…and it is such a treat to get the chance to play her.” Winnick adds that in this society women actually did have a strong voice. “They were allowed to not only be young mothers, young wives and farmers, but also fight in battle and also own land and divorce their husbands and have a strong say in the community and eventually rule,” she says.
 
Another element that distinguishes “Vikings” from other historical dramas such as “The Tudors” is the aspect of religion in the show. Unlike the Christian values and belief system that carry through many other programs, the Vikings' pagan belief system creates a very different dynamic. While the total faith that Rollo puts in the gods could be compared to the sensational beliefs many people of the Middle Ages held, other features make “Vikings” stand out. “It seems like it could be like a world of ‘Game of Thrones.’ You almost expect dragons and orcs and monsters, but these people really did believe in the tales and sagas of giants—Odin losing his eyes and his quest for knowledge,” Standen says. Bloody fight scenes are balanced by the emphasis on these beliefs. “Vikings, for instance, never used to throw away their fingernails. They used to collect them and put them in lockets because they believed that when Floki came back to Ragnar Lodbrok he was going to arrive in a ship made of entirely dead human fingernails,” he adds.
 
While “Vikings” does feature many intense fight scenes, there is more to the show than initially meets the eye. “I think if you don’t play the action side of it, you might lose a lot of people,” Winnick says. That said, the historical accuracy about an oft-misunderstood people, a strong female presence, and an unique pagan belief system should not be overlooked. With season two coming up, viewers should be prepared for a show that features more than just gore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
I never thought the sight of a fish would make me cry.
 
But on Housing Day 2013, when a red-and-yellow cod burst into my room along with a throng of cheering students, I nearly burst into tears.
 
“C-A-B-O-T,” they yelled with as much cheer as I felt despair. “Welcome to the family!”
 
I told my river-bound friends later that I knew quadding happened, but I didn’t think it would happen to me. My imagined Harvard, after all, featured the waters of the Charles glimmering just outside the gate as I relaxed in a sunny courtyard. The Quad existed for the purpose of awkward Visitas and Freshman Week SOCH gatherings only. Watching people desperately sprint to catch the shuttle in the cold of winter provided circus-like amusement. To me, the Quad was foreign and strange. It did not fit into what I considered my Harvard, and I had not anticipated making any adjustments.
 
And yet adjust I did. In fact, if the Housing Gods descended from the heavens today and offered me a spot in Eliot or Lowell—and I desperately longed to Get Lowell a year ago—I would turn it down in an instant. I count myself one of the Quad’s most ardent admirers, and that’s not just because I have spent hours and hours rationalizing to make myself feel better about my misfortune.
 
Perhaps it’s a waste of time, a rehashing of stale arguments, to point out the Quad’s superior room quality. I intend to do it anyway. Where Winthrop houses more cockroaches than co-eds and makes up for a lack of natural light with floor lamps whose cement bases threaten to disintegrate at any moment, Pforzheimer teems with sunny, spacious singles. Order them on a hallway or off a cozy common room—your pick.
 
There’s more to the Quad’s preeminence, though, than just the material.
 
The Crimson has published many an op-ed urging students to venture outside the infamous Harvard Bubble. Go into Boston and walk the Freedom Trail or stretch out on the lawn of the Common. Maybe simply stroll a mile up Massachusetts Avenue into Central Square or a few blocks farther to grab some Toscanini’s burnt caramel gelato. But how often do we follow up on those suggestions? Time is money, especially during recruiting season, and it’s tough to carve out three hours for a movie at Lowe’s.
 
Living in the Quad, my Harvard escape hatch comes without T charge. The oft-decried distance between the Quad and the Yard is emotional as well as physical: The Quad represents a separate sphere from the rest of school, a relaxing one filled with food, and friendship—two of my favorite things. Heading to my room at the end of the day feels like going home. It feels like leaving behind a stressful day and returning to a dorm of my own.
 
The neighborhood surrounding the Quad, too, gives me a taste of the real Cambridge. Not a single house on my walk up Huron Avenue toward Fresh Pond doubles as the Office of Student Something. And when I meander nearby streets, I cross paths with native Cantabrigians, most of whom—believe it or not—have no affiliation with Harvard at all. A little break from the Harvardians I see in lecture halls and trekking up Plympton Street, as much as I love them, certainly does not hurt.
 
Even the walk from Cabot to the Crimson building comes as a boon rather than a burden. It’s often hard to remember every busy day—as we rush from class to the dining hall to class again to meeting after meeting—to stop, breathe, and think. A quiet, solitary 15 minutes can allow one’s mind a break from problem sets or essays or columns due tomorrow, a chance to muse on how the trees look and how air feels and life goes. That chance comes built into my schedule.
 
I’m sure people will scorn the Quad as long as I’m here at Harvard. I’d urge everyone to trek out here and see the truth for him or herself, but I don’t expect many visitors till next Housing Day forces a few our way. And maybe that’s for the best. Maybe it wouldn’t be as special if everyone coveted it. As it is, however, I’m happy here. If you see a tree, polar bear, or—best of all—a cod in your room next week, I think you will be, too.
 
Semper cor, and Semper Quad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Here’s my favorite dialogue from The Social Network:
 -“You don’t know my name, do you?
 -“Is it Stanford?”
 The first line accompanies a shot of actress Dakota Johnson—a former model scheduled to star in the upcoming film adaptation of 50 Shades of Grey—clad in a Stanford sweatshirt and panties. The second line accompanies an up-close, out of focus shot of Dakota’s backside, which leaves the viewer with the demanding task of looking past it toward the focused part of the frame. Thankfully, the viewer is then rewarded with a half-naked image of Justin Timberlake, lying under the covers of a cozy bed.
The film is, of course, idealized. Stanford is not actually full of Timberlakes, Johnsons, and, presumably, Timberlake’s Johnson. But the scene does convey that Stanford is light, warm, and fun—a retreat compared to the darker images of Harvard throughout the movie.
I grew up in California. Especially during March of freshman year, after tripping on layers of sidewalk ice mixed with dirt, cigarette buds, and the frozen tears of those who had fallen before me, I wished I could go back. Stanford, with its size, financial aid program, and academic rigor has a lot of the same benefits that Harvard does, but with all of the Californian rewards. 
I was waitlisted there. By the time I found that out, I was already accepted here. I chose not to stay on the waitlist though, partly because I wanted to leave California. 
But what if I was accepted? It probably wouldn’t have happened. But what if I had stayed on the waitlist and gotten in? In an admissions world that seems so arbitrary, questions like these fill in a lot of gaps for college students. Would I be happier elsewhere? Should I have worked harder in high school? Would I have been able to have sex with Dakota Johnson? 
So, recently, I tried to answer them. I called up a friend of mine at Stanford to talk about what life is really like there. I was hoping to get the normal spiel about excellent extracurriculars, academics, blah, and blah blah. Nothing special—nothing like The Social Network. But unfortunately for my self-assurance, there was much more badass than blah.
“Basically, Stanford loves giving people money for no reason at all,” she said. She then went into detail about how her freshman dorm was given money to rent out a three-story cabin in Lake Tahoe for one weekend, along with ski lift-tickets for the entire group. Now, while that sounds pretty cool, keep in in mind that Harvard also provides students funding. Of course, not $250,000 more of it. But students can always apply for a DAPA grant, which is basically the same as a funded ski trip, except it funds paper plates and cups and mixers and no skiing and no cabin and no traveling. 
It didn’t stop there. She told me about Full Moon on the Quad, an event during which thousands of students make out with one another randomly—some kiss more than 50 others in one night. And the best part is that, with the school barricading the quad and checking student ID’s for entrance, it’s basically school-sponsored. In that way, it’s a lot like Yardfest, except instead of only Tyga behaving like Tyga, everyone behaves like Tyga.
 I could go on about how she talked of “75 degree weather in January” or the “average 7 attractiveness” for guys and girls. But I’ll stop there, because, around that point in our conversation, I tripped on some sidewalk ice and broke my phone.
 I didn’t feel like talking much more anyway. I was hoping for something lame. Instead, I ended up with depressing thoughts of what could have been. I could feel more questions coming on—What if I was there? What if I want to be there? Why is it called Full Moon, rather than Full Mono?
With these thoughts, I wandered into my dorm. There was a surprise birthday going on for one of my entryway-mates. The atmosphere took the edge off of things. After a few minutes of talking to people, I felt more normal again. We talked about classes and things going on over the weekend—it didn’t take long to turn my attention back to this coast.
 During the party, I realized something: We may not have Full Moon, but we show our full moons at primal scream. We don’t have Tahoe, but our closest city is much easier to reach. We don’t have California sun, but we do have Yard snowball fights. 
Of course, all these comparisons are arbitrary. It’s the same with comparing all schools. I don’t know who I would have met at Stanford. I don’t know what my teachers would have been like. I don’t know what surprise birthdays I would celebrate. 
But I do know where I am now. And that’s all I need for now, rather an unrealistic picture of where could have been.
So between any two schools—whether it be Stanford and Harvard; Harvard and BU; or Stanford and Moorpark Community College—comparisons are something best left for the movies. 
Except for Yale. Compared to Harvard, Yale sucks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“Manners count,” we’re all told. I’m pretty sure that half of the time I spent in kindergarten was occupied by lessons in basic etiquette—whether of the “don’t cut in line” or the “food does not belong in your neighbor’s hair” variety. Now, 15 years later, I get the impression that some of us have outgrown these basic rules of decorum—we’re much too busy and sophisticated to even think about manners, much less mind them.
You’re probably thinking: “Great. Another preachy op-ed by some (insert choice expletive) Crimson editor.” You’d be right—I’m not even going to try to be un-preachy in the least. Excoriate me all you want but please reflect on what I write.
I sometimes feel as if I live in a pigsty. Maybe I’m asking too much of Harvard students, but I suspect that anyone who can flawlessly shade hundreds of Scantron bubbles on the SAT is at least capable of keeping a communal bathroom tidy. Cleanliness matters for two reasons: I don’t want to dance navigate a minefield of wadded-up paper towels every time I brush my teeth, and ultimately, we’re not the ones who must crawl around on the floor picking them up.
Maybe the endemic messiness of a dorm like Thayer, my cellblock of choice, is really a self-fulfilling prophecy. “We’re freshman” or “we’re college students” in general don’t constitute sufficient excuses for leaving a puddle of vomit in the hall or a half-empty bottle of electric blue booze (read: rebranded mouthwash) on the stairs. Frankly, I don’t really care how drunk you are—either pick up after yourself like a human being, or sleep it off in the yard. 
I recall one surreal Sunday morning bathroom conversation quite vividly:
“Hey, how’s it going?” I asked.
 “Dude, I got so sick in that toilet last night,” my bathroom companion replied, gesturing to the toilet I was currently using.
“What the hell am I supposed to do with that information?” (This probably wasn’t the most polite response, but it’s the only one I could muster. I certainly have room to improve as well).
On a related note, we could all go out of our way to be a bit friendlier and more courteous to those charged with cleaning up the messes we make. Let’s take the time to acknowledge the basic humanity of the people who scrub our stomach contents off the bathroom floor. Ideally, there would be no vomiting in the first place—but until that happens (I’m not holding my breath), the least we can do is say “thank you” with a smile. Maybe our indifference is a product of the discomfort that disparities in status inevitably provoke, but staring blankly ahead as if no one’s there doesn’t change anything.
Sometimes even I, a student, feel slighted. In a recent, entirely non-scientific study, I held the door for 18 different Harvardians over the course of a few days. Of these, about half could do little more than mumble their appreciation, and three—that’s one in six—failed to say “thank you” altogether. A couple of people simply walked past me without so much as acknowledging my presence, almost as if the door had been magically opened by an invisible doorman to let them and their egos pass. 
I’ll admit that I hail from the South—a place where door holding often elicits a “thank you ma’am/sir”—but I’m hardly asking for much. Etiquette may seem like an empty chore, but as Samir Durrani reminded us in his recent article about handicap icons and ableism, little symbols can have great potency.
I sometimes wonder what it’s like to be one of Harvard Square’s homeless denizens—watching every Friday and Saturday night as packs of privileged students cavort about Cambridge, discarding Solo cups in the bushes and halting traffic as they totter into the street. We’re students who seemingly have it all—with the exception of a healthy dose of appreciation for the fact that we have it so good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Even as Harvard moves to begin construction on its multi-million dollar expansion in North Allston, residents of that neighborhood are raising concerns that the University is not doing enough to improve the Allston area. As part of its plan to build its new campus on the other side of the Charles River, the University proposed a $43 million benefits package to the Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory group to the Boston Redevelopment Authority comprised of Allston residents. The benefits will support new housing and homeownership in the neighborhood, as well as the Gardner Pilot Academy and other projects. Even though the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved the University’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston in October of last year and the task force sanctioned the benefits package, some Allston community members—including members of the task force—remain discontented with the University’s plans amongst Allston residents. The concerns of these residents are misplaced: while Harvard should and does work with the community, the current package is appropriate.
 
 
It is undoubtedly true that the University ought to work with its nearby communities to develop benefits packages that accommodate both Harvard’s long-term construction plans and the needs of affected communities. Each community has a unique set of needs, and the University is right to work with community members to develop ways to benefit its neighbors. These same neighborhoods, however, also must recognize that the University does not have unlimited resources. The University’s primary mission, moreover, is not community development, but teaching and research. It is not the job of Harvard to initiate a wholesale transformation of North Allston, nor was this former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s intended purpose in encouraging regional universities to create community benefits packages.
 
 
The criticisms of the current package fail to take into account the significant benefits to Allston provided by the University beyond the limits of the package itself. Over the years, Harvard has already greatly benefited areas of North Allston through the development of Soldiers’ Field and the Harvard Business School; the University’s presence in those communities constitutes a large and powerful force. Harvard has also embarked on community-driven projects that are not tied to any construction plans, such as the redevelopment of Barry’s Corner in Lower Allston and the recruitment of family-owned small businesses.
 
Harvard, through past initiatives and the current benefits package, is already providing tremendous benefits to the community of Allston. The current package is sufficient, continuing in that trend.

Despite efforts from Undergraduate Council representatives to allow freshmen access to upper class Houses on the eve of Housing Day next Wednesday, members of the Class of 2017 will be denied such entry, according to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
According to an email sent to the freshman class by Dingman on Thursday evening, Securitas guards, Harvard University Police officers, Cambridge Police officer, and the Massachusetts State Police will be present for much of the night.
The increased vigilance will be put in place to dissuade students from participating in River Run, a night of festivities which has in past years involved students consuming alcohol at various upperclassmen Houses. Instead, the Freshman Dean’s Office will encourage freshmen to participate in activities sponsored by the University and the First-Year Social Committee.
“Group bonding experience matters to us,” Dingman said in an interview. “This is really the last night that the freshmen are really without another Harvard affiliation.”
Dingman cited safety as a primary motivation for the increased security, recalling dangerous acts performed by intoxicated students in recent years. He further criticized the role River Run plays in perpetuating a negative stereotype of the Quad Houses.
Undergraduate Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 and President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 met with several University administrators and deans earlier in the semester in support of the tradition of River Run, according to Goffard.
“It’s a tradition,” he said. “It’s one of Harvard’s most fun and greatest traditions. I think that if people want to, they should really be allowed to go into Houses and have fun with their friends.”
Dingman, however, expressed doubt that River Run is a true Harvard tradition, as it only started within the last few years.
Still, Goffard said that while he understands the University prioritizing safety, he and Mayopolous want students to be able to make their own responsible decisions.
While many freshmen interviewed said they had yet to form plans for Housing Day Eve, others claimed that the safety measures will do little to  dissuade students from participating in the River Run tradition.
“I think that people who are on the fence about it won’t go,” said Nathaniel P. Ver Steeg ’17. “The people who are planning on doing it are just going to get around it. If they know people in the River Houses, they’re just going to get them to open the door.”

The Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, which boasts objects collected by departments across the University, launched a new exhibit about the study of human anatomy and dissection at the second floor Science Center exhibit area Thursday evening.
The exhibit, entitled “The Body of Knowledge,” explores the preparation of a human body for dissection, the dissection procedure, and the material culture left behind following the dissection.
“There is an enduring fascination with the human body that has lasted for centuries,” said David S. Jones, a History of Science professor who was involved in the creation of the exhibit, at its opening. “By coming to this exhibit, you are participating in that preoccupation.”
The exhibit, which features preserved organs, skeletons, and at least one full human head, examines the history of human anatomy and dissection not only in the medical field but also in other parts of society throughout history.
Many of the displayed objects, including a large skull that had been used for the past 100 years to teach anatomy, were donated by the Warren Anatomical Museum at the Harvard Medical School. The Warren Museum worked with the large curatorial group that constructed the exhibit.
“We’re looking at the way anatomy was practiced and remembered,” said Cara K. Fallon, a graduate student in the History of Science Department who collaborated with other graduate students and curators to put the collection together in the past year.
In addition to human body parts, the exhibit includes a variety of anatomical models and historical objects. Visitors can walk through a recreation of the Leiden anatomical theater—a 17th century amphitheater that witnessed some of the earliest scientific dissections of humans—as well as a display of objects such as the game Operation that convey the material legacy of human dissection.
Visitors can learn more about 31 features on display by making using of an interactive online gallery guide created by Cira Louise Brown, a Tufts graduate student who was awarded for her work on the exhibit.
Jones said that he hopes that the exhibit inspires curiosity and an “emotional response” from visitors. He added that he understands the difficulty that visitors may have when viewing human bodies on display and welcomes people to question their beliefs regarding the display of human specimens, though he stands by the decision to show them.
“Human bodies need to be treated with respect, but they can also serve a variety of purposes for humanity,” Jones said.
The exhibit will be on display until Dec. 5.

Cambridge developer Raj Dhanda appeared before the Cambridge Historical Commission Thursday night to submit revised plans for three stories of residential units to be built on top of his current Galeria building at 57 JFK St. Citing citizens’ concerns that ranged from architecture to lighting, the commission requested that Dhanda re-submit his proposal April 4.
The proposed addition to the Galeria building at the corner of JFK and Winthrop streets, which currently houses retail stores and restaurants including Staples, Maharaja, and Shake Shack, would accommodate around 40 micro-units of residential housing. Each unit would span about 450 square feet, according to Dhanda.
Dhanda and his architect, Peter Quinn, presented their original designs to the commission four weeks ago. At the meeting, the board reviewed Dhanda’s proposed blueprints and expressed worries about the shadow that the building would cast onto the nearby Winthrop Park, the building’s design aesthetics, and its potential obstruction of the Cambridge skyline.
“We listened to the comments and made serious attempts to address some and if not all of them,” Dhanda said. “This will become a significant building in the core of Harvard Square, and I don’t take that lightly.”
Among revisions to the building plans were an inset third floor that would allow for planter and balcony space, more greenery, and alternative selections of building materials and colors. The proposed complex would be constructed primarily of glass and limestone. Quinn explained at the meeting that the developers conducted a shadow study that found that the proposed construction would not significantly alter the size of the shadow cast on Winthrop Park throughout the year.
Still, meeting attendees were apprehensive about the proposal. Some citizens voiced remaining concerns about the size and height of the building. A few people also suggested that developers make efforts to incorporate the two existing floors with the proposed new level so that the division would be less obvious.
Community activist Marilee Meyer said her opposition to the project comes from an architectural perspective.
“[The proposed construction] is incongruous to the site because of its height, its proportion, its design, its synthetic materials, and its very quick pseudo-retro approach to its architecture,” Meyer said. “It is not carefully thought out, it is not complimentary to the context. It is totally disrespectful.”
Meyer sees this as part of a trend among Dhanda’s buildings, arguing that the “materials and the concepts and the architecture” of his developments do not fit Harvard Square.
Members of the Winthrop Park Trust, which helps run the park as part of a private-public partnership, also voiced concerns about the development.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association and a member of the trust, said that the group met early yesterday morning to review the proposal. She said that the trust decided that information available online was insufficient to reach a decision and that, currently, the trust “opposes any development that abuts the park.”
“In the last version [of the plans] we saw, the shadows from the building really changed the experience in the park,” Jillson said. “There are so few green spaces and we really want to preserve [the park] for the enjoyment of the public.”
Kari Kuelzer, the general manager and co-owner of Grendel’s Den, is also a member of the Winthrop Park Trust, and her mother was a founding member. She is hosting a form-letter on the Grendel’s Den website that protesters may sign and submit to the Cambridge Historical Commission. In addition to fears regarding the building’s shadow and impact on the park, she said she was worried about the development’s lack of additional parking space.
“Harvard Square already has somewhat of a parking crisis,” she said. “As a business owner, I’ve heard other business owners complain about it.”
Meanwhile, Rohit Talwar, the general manager at Maharaja, an Indian restaurant on the top floor of 57 JFK St., said he is unconcerned about the development plans.
“We just know there’s residential units going up. We don’t know more than that,” Tawlar said. “I don’t think that it’s going to affect us that much.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two working groups tasked with determining College priorities for the future of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center have recommended that the renovated space include food options, a venue for large events, and designated space for tourists, among other broad points.
Both working groups—one composed of undergraduates and the other of administrators and House masters—have ceased meeting after convening several times over the winter, both separately and jointly, to discuss the campus center and how it could benefit the College.
 
The renovated Smith Center, expected to undergo construction starting in 2016 and open in 2018, will be housed in the first three floors of what was previously named the Holyoke Center. Harvard Magazine has reported that the project is expected to cost $80 million.
The two College working groups were among a number of other committees convened to solicit ideas for the project from across the University, according to Paul Andrew, acting University vice president for communications. Administrators have emphasized that the space is not a student center or student union, but rather a space for individuals from across schools, including faculty and staff.
According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who co-chaired the working group for College administrators with Leverett House Co-Master Howard M. Georgi ’68, the two College groups submitted joint recommendations to central administrators in recent weeks.
“There’s a lot of brainstorming, really, that was happening, to say, what are some things that would be really interesting to see as part of the campus center, [and] throw in the mix so that [Harvard Planning and Project Management] and the folks that are managing this project can look for synergies across the University,” said Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who co-chaired the undergraduate working group.


 
Friedrich said members of the student working group suggested that the Smith Center should include “as many student services as possible,” comfortable meeting space, and the Harvard Box Office, among other recommendations. Friedrich called food “probably the hottest topic” of the discussion.
Several members of the College working groups suggested that a challenge in creating the campus center will be to best serve undergraduates in a central, accessible location without taking away from House community.
“One theme that was voiced across the working groups is that we don’t want this to take away from House life,” said Cary A. Williams ’16, a member of the working group for undergraduates.
Dingman said that offering food in the campus center, for example, might draw Quad students away from their House dining halls at lunch.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15, who was involved with the student group, suggested that administrators could learn from Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, which he noted is frequented by graduate students but was originally designed for undergraduates.
“That space has sort of fallen off the undergraduate radar,” Mayopoulos said. “I think it’s important for the architects and for the designers of the Smith Campus Center to realize that undergraduates can be easily spooked by or intimated by feeling like they aren’t welcome in a space because it isn’t designed for them.”
 
Dingman also pointed to the Pub as an example of space rarely used by the undergraduate population, saying one way to prevent this from happening at the campus center is to weave existing community activities and programming into the plan for the Smith Center.
 
“This is not a student center; this is a campus center,” Dingman said. “Faculty, staff, alums, graduate students, upperclassmen, freshmen are all imagined as part of the eligible group to be in the space. I don’t know whether freshmen would say that mix creates the allure they have in mind.” Dingman was referencing some freshmen’s desire for their own space.
 
Administrators hope to begin reviewing the feedback on the project this spring “to identify common themes and opportunities that would support the vision of a campus center that truly serves the entire Harvard community, while complementing existing facilities,” Andrew wrote in an email. Beyond the working groups, administrators have solicited feedback on the project through a University-wide online survey and focus groups. Andrew added that administrators would later “communicate important findings” to faculty members, students, and staff.
A different group convened Thursday for a meeting about the campus center and discussed the campus-wide survey, according to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who co-chaired the undergraduate working group with Friedrich.
Administrators first announced plans for renovating the building that will house the Smith Campus Center last November. University President Drew G. Faust first named building a campus center a capital campaign priority in fall 2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
World-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76 filled the Institute of Politics with the sound of music yesterday during a discussion on the arts, which culminated in an interactive cello performance that received a standing ovation from the audience.
The discussion, entitled “Cultural Citizenship," was moderated by David Gergen, the co-director of the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership, a co-sponsor of the event.
“We normally define a ‘good citizen’ as someone involved in political campaigns and so on, but you can also use the arts to be a good citizen—to engage people, to challenge the status quo,” said C. M. Trey Grayson '94, director of the IOP, in explaining the significance of the theme. “Yo-Yo Ma is a leader in this respect.”
Sharing his own understanding of “cultural citizenship,” Ma said, “For me, being a citizen is about looking at how I can be useful at a time when some people say the arts is an ‘elite’ thing. I'm a human first, a citizen second, a musician third, a cellist fourth."
Ma was born in France to Chinese parents, and moved to the U.S. at the age of seven.
“A multi-cultural background can be confusing, but it can also be enriching,” Ma said. “You can look at things from different perspectives, which gets you closer to clarity.”
Ma studied music at the College, even though he said his real passion was anthropology.
“To this day, I often say that there’s nothing I’ve done since college that didn’t start in some way in college,” Ma said. “I met some incredible teachers and friends who opened up my world. It was an education that began a life-long quest to understand things.”
During the question and answer session that followed the discussion, a member of the audience asked about Ma’s source of inspiration.
"It's very simple,” Ma said. “I love people."
The cellist, whose 75 albums have received 15 Grammy Awards, shared his insights on music-making and performance.
"When I perform I'm not the most important person in the room. The audience is the most important person in the room,” Ma said. “The bow is an extension of my lungs, and the four strings are an extension of my vocal cords."
When he took up his cello, Ma turned the audience into a choir by asking everyone to stand on their feet and participate in music-making through singing. This collaborative effort made the JFK forum ring with the harmonies of J.S. Bach’s cello suite.
“Yo-Yo Ma is someone I’m very inspired by, because he was able to change my perception of music from something boring into something fun, and this changed me,” said John Lee, an alumnus of the Kennedy School, who is now a musician.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lester Grinspoon, associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, called on the National Football League last week to sponsor research on the medical use of cannabis.
In an open letter to the institution, Grinspoon highlighted the difference between two compounds found in cannabis, cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which he argued is pivotal in resolving the controversy surrounding the substances.
In particular, he suggested that CBD could potentially provide significant protection for the brain against the damage of repetitive concussions, which are common in professional football games.
“In the past, people tended to cultivate the strains of cannabis which were rich in THC, which was the substance that got you high,” Grinspoon said. “However, as THC went up, CBD, which we are interested in because of its medical properties, actually went down.”
According to Grinspoon, a strain of cannabis with a high CBD to THC ratio could be highly desirable for football players who seek protection against concussions.
“There is no question that cannabidiol is a neuroprotector.”
He also stressed that CBD had no psychoactive effects.
“[CBD] just doesn’t get you high,” he said.
Grinspoon suggested that the lack of investment from pharmaceutical companies is due to the fact that plants and their natural components cannot be patented. In the public sector, it is also difficult to get funding from the government due to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.
“The [funding sources] don’t exist for what I am proposing,” said Grinspoon in email.
In his open letter, Grinspoon argued that funding the research into cannabinoids would not only be “a great public service,” but would also be in the self-interest of the NFL. He claimed that the proposed protective effects of CBD against concussions could reduce the amount of compensation the NFL would have to provide for former players who have brain damage.
In order for the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the sale of a drug, it would require animal studies followed by “a number of controlled studies on a group of human beings,” to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.
“[We need] millions of dollars.” Grinspoon estimated when asked about the scale of funding he had in mind.  “[The NFL] must go beyond simply following the medicine, and help lead the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 35 undergraduate and graduate students gathered Thursday evening at a town hall meeting to express frustration with what they perceive to be the lack of institutional support for the Latino community and disappointment in the community’s division on campus.
At the forum, sponsored by Concilio Latino, students voiced a wide range of specific concerns regarding their individual experiences as Latino students at Harvard and brainstormed potential solutions to be implemented this semester.
“I’m tired of being calm. I’m tired of not being heard,” said Christian Ramirez ’15, echoing a common sentiment shared by students who spoke at the event, dubbed LatinX and held in Ticknor Lounge.
Herbert B. Castillo ’14, one of the coordinators of the event, began the discussion by citing what he characterized as a history of weak support for Latinos in the College, ranging from the administration’s decision to turn down a program for Latino Studies in 2002 to the lack of a Latino cultural center on campus.
“I think it’s the right moment for us to be doing this,” Castillo said of the decision to create the event and bring together the Latino community in an interview after the event.
Other students expressed dissatisfaction with the amount and quality of resources available to minority students at Harvard.
Kristina D. Lorch ’17, a Crimson news editor, spoke of her disappointment upon discovering that the support systems at Harvard were missing the resources, like a cultural center, present at other universities like Yale and Stanford.
“It’s holding our community back,” she said.
Castillo said that he thinks Harvard’s organization responsible for minority groups, the Harvard Foundation, fails to provide adequate funding for student groups.
“We all kind of agree that it’s let us down,” Castillo said.
Other students said that they had trouble identifying with advisers assigned by the College.
“Although we have the PAF program, proctors, Race Relations tutors, I personally don’t really know who to go to,” Jasmine A. Fernandez ’16 said.
Nelida Garcia ’14 recounted her experiences with the Race Relations tutors in her House after an event last year which featured offensive stereotypes about Latinos.
Although the tutors were empathetic, she said, she was upset to discover “their role was, if you feel hurt, all you have to do is vent and that’s it. The administration doesn’t give them the power to do anything more than hear you out.”
When discussing possible solutions for better organizing the Latino community to address these perceived issues, students proposed conducting a campus-wide survey to better gauge all student's experiences with discrimination and integration on campus.
“The school needs to know how prevalent this feeling of not really being integrated here is,” Veronica Gloria ’15 said.
Students also decided to create a task force to further explore options to strengthen the Latino community, which plans to meet in the coming week.
“We need to make this happen quickly,” said Dianisbeth M. Acquie ’16, who works for the Harvard Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program. “I don’t just say this because I’m tired. I say this because at the end of this month, so many Latinos will receive acceptance letters. I feel like a liar sometimes if I tell these kids that this situation is a great experience for everyone.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 10, 2014
An earlier version of this article stated that students at the LatinX town hall meeting suggested creating a survey to better understand the experience of Latino students at Harvard. To clarify, the survey is meant to gauge the experience of all students pertaining to issues of discrimination and integration.

One win.
For the Harvard men’s basketball team, which has already clinched a share of its fourth consecutive Ivy League title, one win is all it will take to secure its third straight NCAA Tournament bid and outright Ancient Eight crown.
The Crimson (24-4, 11-1 Ivy) will take to the road this weekend to close out its regular season against Yale (15-11, 9-3) on Friday night and Brown (15-11, 7-5) on Saturday evening. Harvard is up two games on the Bulldogs in the conference standings.
The Crimson is hot off a sweep of Cornell and Columbia, which guaranteed Harvard its share of the Ivy title. In its final home stand of the season, the Crimson handed convincing wins to the Big Red and the Lions, despite going to double overtime with Columbia on the Lions’ home turf earlier in February.
“We’re incredibly pleased and proud to be in this position,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “If you think about our program a number of years ago, and now we’re sitting here looking at four Ivy League championships in a row. We’re pleased about that.”
One win is all Harvard needs, but it won’t come easily against second-place Yale. The Bulldogs provided the Crimson its only conference loss of the season on Feb. 8, the night after Harvard barely eked out a win over the Bears at Lavietes Pavilion.
“We had a lot of turnovers, and we need to cut down on those,” sophomore guard Siyani Chambers said. “We need to just go out there and box out and defend, and if we limit them to as few shots as possible, I think we have a good chance.”
Though the Crimson was able to shut down the Bears’ leading scorer, tri-captain guard Sean McGonagill, a surprise 11-point contribution from freshman guard Tavon Blackmon kept Harvard on its toes. The Crimson suffered a drought on the offensive end of the floor, with only freshman forward Zena Edosomwan finishing in the double digits. The leading scoring duo of Chambers and junior wing Wesley Saunders were all but silenced—combining for 10 points.
The lack of energy from Friday’s game carried over, and the Crimson fell to Yale behind poor shooting and inconsistent defense. Though Saunders was back to form with 16 points, Harvard couldn’t contain sophomore center Justin Sears, who lit up the hosts for 21 points.
“I think what you see in the course of a season, there are going to be ebbs and flows throughout the year,” Amaker said. “Injuries, or not playing well, or you find yourself in a little bit of a slide or a funk…. We knew coming off of that loss that our preparation needed to be better, and I think ever since then, our guys have responded incredibly well with the week of preparation prior to the weekend’s games.”
A win this Friday in the Crimson’s more difficult matchup would secure the NCAA Tournament bid, but both games could influence Harvard’s seeding in the Big Dance. After failing to convert on opportunities to get statement, nonconference wins at Colorado and Connecticut earlier this season, the Crimson needs all the help it can get if it wants a boost on Selection Sunday.
Though Harvard will be playing for the crown on Friday, co-captain Laurent Rivard has his eyes on the road ahead.
“[Friday is] pretty much the championship game,” Rivard said. “Saturday is just the next game on our schedule. We’re going to approach it like any other game, even if we win on Friday. It’s still an important game, especially for seeding purposes.”
In its final weekend of the regular season, Harvard will close out an up-and-down title run. Marked by the return of co-captain Brandyn Curry and senior Kyle Casey after yearlong leaves of absence, the 2013-2014 season has been an opportunity for the Crimson to put the pieces together. Despite injuries that have depleted the squad’s size, Harvard will rely on its still-deep bench to get things going in New Haven and Providence.
Although the same five starters have taken the court for the Crimson in 25 of 28 games, contributions from the likes of Curry and Edosomwan have been make-or-break throughout the season. In its final week of regular season practice, Harvard has focused on taking it one game at a time.
“It’s been a great week of preparation,” Amaker said. “We’ve talked about first things first, so Friday night is first. But it’s two games for the weekend, and our kids have embraced that. We recognize how tough these two games are going to be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It won’t be The Game in New Haven this Friday, but it will be something close.
On the last weekend of Ivy League play, Harvard heads to Yale with the opportunity to celebrate a third straight championship. The Bulldogs need to win twice and hope Harvard drops Saturday’s game in Providence to force a playoff. The first step will come at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, where the Bulldogs will have a chance to sweep the season series against Harvard. Unlike the football version, I expect better fans than Captain Morgan and Jack Daniels to attend Friday’s all-important game.
For Tommy Amaker and the Harvard men’s basketball team, a win would avenge its only league loss and cap off one of the most dominant runs in recent conference history. Already having secured a share of its fourth consecutive league title last weekend, Amaker’s Crimson has outscored Ivy League opponents by over 16 points a game thus far this season. That’s not a typo.
A year ago, dear reader, you might remember Princeton being in nearly the same situation. Two wins on the Yale-Brown road trip would have sent Princeton to the tournament. The Tigers lost both, and two Harvard home wins sent the Crimson to the Dance—a turn of events Amaker has surely not let his team forget.
Before we dive into the weekend’s action, I’d like to honor one of the best byproducts of the Harvard-Yale rivalry: the invention of a live mascot. Jealous of the Crimson bandanas the Harvard crew wore in 1889, a Yale student decided his team needed a snappier emblem of team pride. The undergrad bought an English bulldog, named him Handsome Dan, and paraded him across the field before Eli sporting events.
Thus far, not counting my father—who boasts the moniker as a personal nickname—there have been 17 dogs to hold the position of Handsome Dan. Important criteria for bulldog selection: the canine must have negative reactions both to the color crimson and to tigers, it has to keep itself clean, and it must bark in the affirmative when asked about its Rhodes Scholarship.
While The Hartford Courant described the original Dan as “a cross between an alligator and a horned frog,” his followers have had more success. Dan IX appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1956, and Dan X—colloquially known as “Bayside Woodnought”—was sired. Two Dans later, the bulldog was stolen by four Princeton undergrads posing as Yale cheerleaders. The cheerleaders-turned-thieves hid the dog in New York while running away from authorities in what was likely the best Step Up script never written.
The early Dans got to Harvard, however. In 1908, before a 4-0 Harvard win in The Game, football coach Percy Haughton was rumored to have strangled a bulldog doll to death to motivate his team to beat Yale.
The rivalry has simmered since then, but on Friday, everything will once again be on the line. Time to play ball.
On to the games.
PENN V. COLUMBIA
This Penn team has underwhelmed in a season in which many expected it to compete for the league’s top spot. How underwhelming? When your school newspaper runs a column titled “I, for one, welcome our new Crimson overlords,” there are two possibilities.
A. You’ve lost to Harvard one too many times for the faithful.
B. Dragons have invaded Philadelphia, and you’re preemptively surrendering.Either way, no news would be good news.
Pick: Columbia
PRINCETON V. CORNELL
Like all good Cornell alums, I’ll take a page out of Andy Bernard’s book and harken back to Cornell’s not-so-recent glory days. Players from the 2010 Big Red team, most notable for making the Sweet 16, are getting back together to compete in a national five-on-five tournament with $500,000 on the line. The tournament ranks teams by how many online “fans” they have, and Cornell ranks just ahead of “James and the Dudes”—which is self-described as “some friends straight outta Wallingford” and is probably made up of guys that call bank on free throws. Go crazy, Jeff Foote.
Pick: Princeton
DARTMOUTH V. BROWN
The Big Green is the argument against the Ivy League regular season format. While the 14-game season makes every contest increasingly important, teams fall out of contention early and have no last shot to make it up. Since the turn of the century, Dartmouth has entered every final conference weekend—and in all but three years, the last two conference weekends—eliminated from title competition.That said, with a program that in 2010 had its entire team sign and deliver a paper to the administration threatening to boycott a weekend game unless its coach was fired, maybe an end-of-season tournament would do little to help.
Pick: Brown
HARVARD V. YALE
On the court, the matchup between Yale junior guard Armani Cotton and Harvard junior wing Wesley Saunders could be the deciding one. Last year, Saunders averaged 14.5 points against Yale on 75 percent shooting in two wins but hit just 6-of-17 shots against the Bulldogs for a hard-earned 16 points in the teams’ first showdown this season. Cotton had his first double-double of the season in Cambridge, scoring 13 points (on just five shots) and grabbing 10 rebounds. Yale is 7-3 this season when he scores in double digits. Cotton had just one point, missing all eight field goals, in last week’s loss to Princeton. To save the Bulldogs’ season, he must step up.
Pick: Harvard
PRINCETON V. COLUMBIA
A game between two teams headed in very opposite directions. Columbia’s only graduating senior hasn’t come off the bench this year, and Princeton will lose four players, including Ivy League Player of the Year candidate T.J. Bray, after this season. The Tigers are much better than their record, having lost four of its six league games by a combined 11 points, but Columbia boasts two of the conference’s top 10 players in junior forward Alex Rosenberg and sophomore guard Maodo Lo. Under coach Kyle Smith, the Lions are on a clear upswing.
Pick: Columbia
PENN V. CORNELL
This will be the second game of the weekend with two African-American head coaches squaring off, a byproduct of the Ivy League’s uniquely diverse coaching body. By comparison, the Big 10 and Big 12 will have a combined two such matchups this year. However, Friday’s game in Ithaca matches up the only two coaches in the conference on the hot seat.
It’s rare to get fired in the Ivy League—former Harvard coach Frank Sullivan owns the distinction of owning the most wins and losses in the Ancient Eight—but both Jerome Allen and Bill Courtney have taken over powerhouses and have been unable to vault their programs back into the conference’s upper echelon. Longtime Penn Director of Athletics Steve Bilsky announced he would retire in June, and his replacement may want his own guy. A recent Daily Pennsylvanian article in which a quoted alum speculated that “it is possible that Jerome…is not the right fit to be our head coach” will not make anything better for Allen.
As for Courtney, everything has gone wrong this year. Playing a motivated Penn senior Miles Jackson-Cartwright won’t help.
Pick: Penn
DARTMOUTH V. YALE
Last October, news broke that Yale students had taken to defecating in laundry hampers, presumably soiling a perfectly good ensemble of dark blue polos and light brown trousers. This Tuesday, Bulldog students once again tarnished a sacred space. As if the Poopetrator-ruined laundry was not enough, a student crawling through the lower level of a Yale library wrapped in a red sleeping bag redefined the meaning of Lamonster. Logically, one student screamed and called it a snake; another thought it was poisonous.I do say, Howard, we must call the authorities. The ruffians are at it again.
Pick: Yale
HARVARD V. BROWN
Last time Harvard visited Providence, Brown coach Mike Martin had this to say after his team lost: “Are they a better team than us? Absolutely. Should we compete better than we did tonight? Absolutely. It’s unacceptable.” Since then, Brown has been 11-6 in the Ivy League and hasn’t lost any of those games by more than 10 points. It’s not quite the Dennis Green tantrum, but Martin’s rage has worked wonders.
Pick: Harvard
PENN V. PRINCETON
When this matchup was first announced, everybody thought it was going to feature two elite teams playing for what would be regional superiority. Fans experienced nostalgia for the glory days of the two squads, one of which had arguably the league’s best player. Quickly though, it became apparent that this game wouldn’t live up to the hype or the ones that came before it. Truly a shame.When put in those terms, Space Jam 2 sounds a lot like next Wednesday’s Penn-Princeton matchup, doesn’t it?
Pick: Princeton

The Housing Portal has opened and closed for 2017’s freshman class, but the friendships (or awkward avoidances) and memories between blocking and linking groups have only just begun. While the portal was seemingly impossible to navigate at some points (s/o to all group leaders for getting it together!), there was one step that proved to be the gift that just kept giving. When trying to link up with another blocking group, freshmen were presented with a list of every, and I mean EVERY, other unlinked blocking group.Intrigued, I took the prerogative to sort through all these groups and suggest who should link with whom based on name alone.Sexiest Blocking Group I Know & Such Blocking. Very Group. Wow.I feel like both of these groups had the same idea, but only one was able to actually articulate their feelings. The other group must have an affinity for periods.Fun&Flirty4 & Freshman Hottest 16-24(Full disclosure: the latter is my blocking group. Yes, the grammatical and mathematical errors were unintentional; you can’t win ‘em all)Dear Fun&Flirty4,Wanna hang out?Xo,Freshman Hottest 16-24Charlie & DaBabiesImagine Charlie’s Angels, but instead of angels, there are just three screaming, crying babies that he has to watch over.Wigg E & Co. & Grays Middle*These people are practical. They go out twice a week--never more--and always eat breakfast. You can find them judging you on a Sunday afternoon when you sleep until 3pm.Boardblock Empire & HIMYM50For those of you under a rock: HIMYM is an acronym for How I Met Your Mother, a very popular TV comedy. I know it’s a bold move pairing this heavy HBO drama series with a comedy about finding love, but life is a balancing act! The Boardblockers will need laughs from time to time and HIMYMers will definitely need a reality check after too much Barney Stinson.Rock Out With Your Block Out & Block You Like A HurricaneI don’t know if I necessarily want to hang out with these crews but they will get along with each other just swimmingly! I imagine lots of aggressive fist bumping and week-long beer pong tournaments.SBORNIK MATHEMATICS & Alkali MetalThis crew will sit around their common room table for hours and discuss the theories that explain life on this planet, black holes, supernovas...the list continues. After a quick google search (Read: I didn’t know any of this and I don’t want to pretend I did), I learned that Sbornik is a Russian mathematical journal that has been published since 1866. Alkali Metals are a group in the periodic table of elements. Clearly, these people were meant to find each other.Honorable Mentions:Block Party & Block of AgesBaby Got Block & I Believe I Can Swai

Freshmen, listen up:
Housing Day will be here faster than you can say “not Slytherin.” You’re nervous, you’re excited, and you’re probably confused. We’re here to help. You only live Housing Day once, after all. We’ve put together a handy schedule to make sure that you live it right.7:30 a.m.: Wake upYou were probably early to bed the night before, retiring just after the rollicking reception the First-Year Social Committee designed to replace the far less entertaining River Run. Since, I repeat, you absolutely did not engage in any traditional Housing Day Eve festivities or imbibe even a sip of alcohol, you’ll have no trouble leaping out of bed to greet the day. Though you will not find yourself with even a hint of a hangover-induced headache, it certainly can’t hurt to grab some coffee before you head to the dorm where you’ll soon receive your House assignment letter.Some time around 8:30 a.m.: Dorm StormThe cacophonous crowd of upperclassmen gathered in front of the John Harvard statue will begin to disperse around eight o’clock. Take note of few things to consider before the giant elephant, penguin, or polar bear mascots arrive at your door:1. Come to an understanding with your linkmates about whether or not the first to hear housing word will share the news. You don’t want to start crying even before Currierites arrive to welcome you to a different zip code (just kidding—we think).
2. Don’t actually cry. You’ll hurt the upperclassmen’s delicate feelings. Third, try not to fall for dirty tricks, such as Adams residents chanting “Cabot” or "Dudley" as they approach. Rumor has it those gullible enough to believe such ruses get thrown out of the gold House and relegated to the Quad after all. Did you fall for that, too? Exactly.Lunch Time: Sustenance and SwagAfter learning the location of your new home, head to Annenberg to pick up paraphernalia corresponding to your new House. Last year, Dunster had moose antlers, so keep your fingers crossed! This is also your best opportunity to cop a free bro tank—first come, first serve, so you better head over early. Pick up some food, too. And most important, take this opportunity to glare at classmates whom the Housing Gods favored over you or to laugh at those less fortunate. Not that we’re suggesting that some houses are better than others…Afternoon: MidtermTake the test Harvard has thoughtfully allowed your professor to schedule on the biggest day of freshman year. Good luck!3:00pm: NapNo explanation needed here. You’ll need one.5:30pm: Denizen DinnerYour home for the next three years will graciously have invited you to a banquet held in your honor. Don’t get your hopes up; the dinner will consist of your normal HUDS fare. That said, the rest of the event should make the future look pretty bright. Scope out your soon-to-be living companions and listen to Housemasters deliver heartfelt speeches. Find out who takes care of the rooming lottery and grab him or her extra dessert. Tread lightly; first impressions take a while to fade. But hey, if things go badly, remember that you can always transfer.

It’s Friday! You're almost done with midterms and there's just one week left until sweet, sweet freedom. You can do this!
Start off your weekend by checking out some of the Housing Day videos that have been released so far: Winthrop, Quincy, Pfoho, Dunster, Cabot, and (kind of) Leverett, Lowell, and Adams. If you’re a freshman, you can obsess and fall in love with something that will most likely never love you back (story of our lives, am I right?!), and if you’re an upperclassmen, you can loudly promote your own house’s video while secretly admiring all the others. It’s okay, everyone does it. No matter your year, make sure to check out Flyby’s profiles of all the houses over the next week for a fun and thorough evaluation!IN THE ATMOSPHEREToday’s high of 38 degrees is pretty much 40 degrees, which pretty much means spring, right?

With its well-intended changes, the SAT seems to have  unconsciously alienated the international community of high school  students who wish to pursue an education in the US.
According to an  announcement made early Wednesday afternoon by David Coleman, President  of The College Board, the SAT will undergo major changes starting in the  spring of 2016. Amidst changes including an optional writing section  and the return of the overall scoring to a 1600 scale, one key change  will have a profound effect on international students.
As stated in the New York Times, “Every exam will include a  reading passage from either one of the nation’s ‘founding documents,’  such as the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, or from  a "global conversation" of such texts, such as the Rev. Dr.  Martin Luther King Jr’s ‘Letter from a Birmingham Jail.’” For an international student, this will have frightening implications for those of us who have not studied American history or literature.
According to Mr. Coleman in a recent interview with the New  York Times, this new policy is meant to realign standardized testing  with schoolwork; to make test preparation more of a learning process  than a systematic “gaming”. However, the test-makers might have  neglected to consider that not all high schoolers in the world learn  about the founding documents.
The SAT, as the age-long college admissions exam for  universities in the United States, has always been a main source of  anxiety for international students, especially with the language  differences and the rarity of the ACT outside the U.S. Though the removal  of arcane SAT words like “picayune” and elimination of the guessing  penalty make the new SAT seem more accessible for both international and  domestic students alike, many internationals are worried about reading  passages concerning these “founding documents”.
Given the diverse nature of high school education systems  around the world, many international students have no prior exposure to  U.S. history or the “founding documents”.  Many are concerned that they will be at a great disadvantage, and now  will need to spend copious amounts of extra time learning about these  documents.
Daisy Zheng, a high school freshman in Beijing, expresses  dismay: “Now I have to be familiar with US history and take extra time  to learn about those documents aside from all the existing workload.”
The new SAT, meant to make test prep blend better into high school  education and less of an independent hassle on its own, has inadvertently  added more workload for these international students.
While some internationals are concerned with the extra work,  others express concern over its cultural implications.
“I get it, it’s  an exam meant for prospective students in American universities, I can’t  blame them for putting more focus on things like the Declaration of  Independence. But it feels weird,” Emma Espinosa, a student studying in  an international school in Spain, said. “I think it’s kind of wrong,  like it was not meant for international students to take it, or we won’t  be welcomed to study in the U.S. if we are not familiar with them.”
 
 
According to a recent report released by the College Board on Feb. 11, the number of high school students taking Advanced Placement exams has been consistently increasing over the past 10 years.
Of the high school students graduating in 2013, 1,003,430 have taken one or more of the AP exams, compared to the 514,163 students in the high school class of 2003. The number of AP Exams taken has more than doubled in the interim, rising from 1,328,511 in 2003 to 3,153,014 in 2013.
There has been an even more significant—to be precise, 371.65%—increase in the number of AP examinees from low-income families, which has risen from 58,549 to 275,864 since 2003. However, the expansion of access to AP exams is still an ongoing effort.
According to the College Board, nearly 300,000 students in the Class of 2013 graduated without having taken any matched AP course. In its report, the College Board pledged itself to “identify those students with potential, using validated tools, and ensure they have the AP opportunities they have earned.”
The College Board claims the performance on AP exams continues to improve as well, which the report has attributed to “the late nights that students put in diligently studying and the Saturdays that teachers give up to help their students succeed.”
However, 39.5% of AP Examinees in the Class of 2013 scored below 3 on all the AP Exams they took, a proportion that has increased from 35.5% in 2003. Of all the AP scores received by the Class of 2013, 42.7% were below 3, which has also gone up from 39.3% in 2013.
The College Board observed that the performance on the AP exams varied by state. On average, 20.1% of U. S. students in the Class of 2013 scored 3 or higher on an AP exam during high school. 17 states had a higher percentage of students scoring 3 or higher on the AP Exams than the national average.
In Maryland, 29.6% of the Class of 2013 scored 3 or higher on an AP exam, leading the nation. In terms of improvement over the past decade, Connecticut has seen the largest percentage increase—13.2%—in the number of students scoring 3 or higher on the AP Exams.
The advancement of the AP exams has been plagued with continuing racial inequality. According to the College Board, African American students in the Class of 2013 remained underrepresented in AP classrooms and in the population of successful AP Examinees, defined as students scoring 3 or above on at least one AP Exam. Only 4.6% of African American AP Examinees across the United States scored 3 or above on at least one AP Exam, which stood in sharp contrast with the national average of 60.5%.
