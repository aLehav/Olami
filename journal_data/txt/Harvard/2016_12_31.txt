After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, it was clear that I was not the sort of girl who could be a princess—the docile, glossy, and cartoonishly big-eyed kind. The kind always wishing for their prince. I was not graceful or thin or pretty enough. I was a little too messy, a little too loud.
But Princess Leia was a different kind of princess. She was angry about being rescued. She fought. I watched Princess Leia wield a blaster pistol with precision, watched her fix her Imperial captors with a steely glare as her planet exploded into thousands of smoldering fragments. As Princess Leia melted Han Solo out of a carbonite prison, she chipped away at the gendered damsel-in-distress narrative trope. Even when Jabba the Hutt put her in a gold metal bikini — turning her into the sexual fantasy of a million teenage boys—Princess Leia still strangled Jabba the Hutt with the chains that tethered her to him. Princess Leia taught me that I was, in fact, the sort of girl who could be a princess—the kind who fought back, who held her own, who took names. When my stormtroopers and Imperial officers arrived in the form of middle school bullies, or calculus tests, or college applications, I remembered the woman who knew how to confront her problems head-on.
But I’ve realized the Leia I needed most was General Leia Organa, leader of the Rebellion, champion of the Resistance. It was General Organa, after all, who realized that royalty is inherited but leadership is earned through hard work and trust. General Organa, battle-weary, brokenhearted, who sat through fight after fight, suffered personal defeat after another; General Organa, who lost her son to the dark side, whose brother disappeared to reclusion and whose husband reverted to a life of dodging responsibility, who remained the steadfast military general that the New Republic needed. It was General Organa who set aside her natural Force strength in favor of commanding the Resistance, and who demonstrated the kind of heroism and leadership and dynamism too meaningful to package in a gold metal bikini.
Carrie Fisher was something different to each of us. We mourn the loss of not only a space princess and general, but a talented actress, a candid writer, and a mental health advocate. We mourn a survivor of addiction, a witty comedienne, and an outspoken opponent of Hollywood ageism.
Even rehashing Carrie Fisher’s résumé feels like a disservice to the bold, honest, self-critical, witty person who inhabited such a prominent place in pop culture and film. In every medium, in every outlet, from talk show interview to memoir to science fiction blockbuster, she had an unwavering vitality, an inarticulable presence. Carrie Fisher and her Princess Leia were made, unfailingly, of hope—the stuff rebellions are built upon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the locations, opponents, and level of drama were very different, the rise to victory of Harvard men’s basketball over the last two games—versus Houston and Howard—were somewhat similar for one main reason. Bryce Aiken.
Against Houston, Aiken scored eight points in under two minutes as the second half ticked town to pull his team within one.  After a bucket from senior center Zena Edosomwan, the team would walk away with a 57-56 victory, with Aiken ending the night with 21 points—tying a career-high.
On Friday against Howard (3-11), the rookie from New Jersey once again took charge on offense to allow his team to pull away, although this time the breakthrough would happen much earlier and more often, leading to a 67-46 victory for Harvard (6-4) over the Bison. The win extends the Crimson’s current win streak to five games.
While the game would eventually become a blowout for Harvard, the early minutes of the game showed a different story. The Crimson was unable to build a cushion as it worked to react to Howard’s speed. Harvard was making stops on defense, but had several early turnovers, many of which were passes picked off from the backcourt into the paint.
Though Harvard started the game with a 7-0 lead, the game stayed within two possessions through almost the entire first half until Aiken got hot in the waning possessions. With 1:27 to go and Harvard up three, Aiken found classmate Henry Welsh under the basket for a layup and foul, with Welsh completing the three-point play from the line.
On the Crimson’s next offensive possession, Aiken took the ball down the floor, looking like he was going to drive, but instead stepped back from his defender and hit an unassisted triple. He would close out the half with a layup to give his team a double-digit lead it would never relinquish.
“Before halftime, I feel like we really pushed the pace and gained a lead and that really helped us go into the second half, transition over,” Aiken said. “I think ever since then we were able to control the game.”
Aiken would finish the night with a career-high 23 points, including a personal-best six triples on nine attempts. He achieved the feat in only 24 minutes, whereas he has played a minimum of 30 in both of his previous 20-plus point performances.
“Bryce’s offensive ability is changing the game for us,” Amaker said. “He’s done that now for the last two games where his shot-making ability just changes it, and that’s certainly something that we needed and will continue to need.”
As Aiken spread the defense out beyond the arc as he posed a shooting threat, the inside pair of freshman Chris Lewis and Edosomwan took seriously their roles as rebounders and rim protectors in a game in which the Bison were quite mismatched in size. Edosomwan led all players with 16 boards to go with eight points, while Lewis had seven rebounds and 10 points.
The game exemplified how Edosomwan’s role on the team has shifted given the increase in scorers compared to the 2015-2016 squad. Last season, Edosomwan was charged with being the team’s offensive focal point and creating his own shots by receiving the ball in the paint or on the block and using a power dribble to evade defenders on his way to the rim. Against Howard, he utilized many more putbacks to notch his points. Overall, the Crimson had 30 points in the paint compared to just eight for Howard.
“[Edosomwan]’s role is different, and it had to be given the personnel that we had,” Amaker said. “I think he’s adjusted and adopted what we need from him which is to be a great defensive rebounder, to be a rim protector, and to be an offensive force when we need him to be whereas that was always what we asked from him last year.”
With a comfortable lead, Amaker was able to utilize his large roster to keep fresh legs on the floor, including using 12 players in the first half alone and 17 overall—which accounted for every healthy body on the bench. Three players did not dress for the contest, most notably senior co-captain Corbin Miller who is suffering from concussion symptoms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another day, another win for the Harvard women’s basketball team. Only this time the result came against a previously undefeated team and yielded a championship trophy.
In 2013, the Crimson placed second at the Fordham Holiday Classic. On Friday night, Harvard topped that performance, riding hot shooting to a 74-62 victory over Buffalo (10-1) in the Rose Hill Gymnasium in The Bronx, N.Y.
The Bulls entered the title game as the No. 3 mid-major program in all of women’s hoops, according to CollegeInsider.com. But by game’s end, the team had left the gym with its first defeat of the season.
Meanwhile Harvard (11-1) heads into conference play with an 11-game win streak and the momentum of a tournament championship—all told, the best start in recent program history.
“This win means so much to our team,” freshman forward Jeannie Boehm said. “It proves that all of our hard work has payed off. I think we're super confident going into conference play now, and we all feel very ready and excited.”
Starting the third quarter, the Crimson held a 52-45 lead. Buffalo did not throw in the towel, pulling within three with 2:13 left to play. Still, Harvard, which had overcome a pair of early deficits itself, proved staunch.
A jump shot by junior guard Taylor Rooks and a layup by sophomore guard Madeline Raster gave the Crimson breathing room. That advantage held, as Harvard iced the game and left with a 74-62 victory.
The end of the night contrasted with the beginning. Starting the game, Buffalo capitalized on two turnovers by Harvard with a quick four points and established a lead early in the matchup.
That advantage held until the last 38 seconds of the first quarter, when the Crimson mounted a five-point run. Freshman guard Katie Benzan hit a three in the final second to give Harvard its first lead of the evening, 20-17.
A similar narrative defined the second quarter. This time the Bulls held off Harvard until 2:33 remained in the half. Then a Rooks three-pointer catalyzed a 10-0 run that gave the Crimson a 35-27 lead at intermission.
Rolling over her success from last game, Benzan again led the team with 18 points and five assists. For her efforts, she earned tournament M.V.P. Destiny Nunley led the team with seven rebounds and also earned all-tournament honors.
“Because we have such good post players like Jeannie Boehm and Destiny Nunley, our opponents can't double-[team],” Benzan said. “And if they do double, then the kick-out is there. Jeannie and Destiny do an awesome job of reading the defense and the double to get our shooters open shots.”
Throughout the game though, the Bulls grabbed more rebounds, picking up 19 of the 24 total offensive boards and thus doubling Harvard’s second-chance points. The Crimson led in rebounds on the other side of the ball, picking up 24 defensive rebounds to Buffalo’s 18.
Boehm had a monopoly on Harvard’s blocks, notching all six of the team’s total for the game. Prior to the tournament, Boehm ranked 13th in the NCAA for blocks with an average of 2.8 per game. As a team, the Crimson placed 22nd with 5.8 rejections every contest.
For Harvard, the game came down to shooting. Again, the team shot lights-out, sinking 54.2 percent from the field compared to the Bulls’ mark of 34.8. The Crimson dominated from beyond the arc, as well, making exactly half of its attempts.
“We are successful beyond the arc because of our ball movement and because we always find the open player,” Benzan said. “We have great team chemistry where really we don't care about our individual stats. We just care about one score that's on the scoreboard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With four weeks having elapsed since the Harvard men’s hockey team last took the ice, some rust was to be expected from the Crimson in its return to action Friday night, especially early on.
That turned out not to be the case. Instead, the opening six minutes saw Harvard fire 11 shots on goal, the last of which gave the Crimson its first lead of the season’s second stanza. And that edge would not be erased, as No. 4 Harvard (9-2-1, 5-1-1 ECAC) led throughout in a 5-1 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“It’s been a long break, and I think the guys were hungry to get back at it,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We knew this was a game that we wanted to have and needed to have with us trailing a lot of our league foes in games played. So it was an important two points for us.”
At least one skater from each of the Crimson’s four lines lit the lamp against the last-place Engineers (3-17-1, 1-10-0). Three stat-sheet ‘regulars’ notched goals, as seniors Luke Esposito and Sean Malone each scored on the power play and top-line sophomore Ryan Donato converted on a wrap-around. But also getting in on the action, freshman Ty Pelton-Byce and junior Eddie Ellis picked up their first goals of the season.
Pelton-Byce got the ball rolling on the tail end of Harvard's 11-shot outburst, turning a low wrister from just outside the slot into his first collegiate goal at 5:27 in period one.
“We had to be mentally prepared to come out of the gate firing,” Pelton-Byce said. “And I think we did a good job of that.”
Yet, after the Crimson's lightning-fast start, Harvard only produced three more shots on goal in the frame. But one of them found the mesh. Skating around the RPI net, Malone spotted Esposito inside the right faceoff circle, where the senior from Greenwich, Connecticut, flung a wrister past sophomore netminder Cam Hackett on the power play at 13:05.
Things didn’t grow any easier for Hackett, who has allowed 13 goals in his last two starts against the Crimson. Co-captain Devin Tringale forced a turnover deep in the Engineer zone to set up Ellis’s gritty punch-in at 7:06 in the second, bringing the score to 3-0 in favor of the hosts.
RPI finally retaliated less than a minute later when freshman center Jacob Hayhurst sniped the upper right corner of the net, beating the glove of Harvard netminder Merrick Madsen from atop the slot. In the five minutes that followed, the Engineers pushed hard for another score, generating a power play and creating seven more shots on goal.
“At 3-1 in the second, I thought the team that was going to score the next goal was going to win,” RPI coach Seth Appert said. “I thought the next seven minutes, we were all over them. We were buzzing them, and Madsen was fantastic…. If he wasn’t as good as he was, we had a chance to get that to 3-2.”
Madsen stopped all seven shots during the Engineer flurry as part of a 30-save performance, his third of the season. The junior goaltender made 10 of those stops during RPI power plays, helping the Crimson penalty kill finish a perfect 5-for-5 on the night and increase its streak of consecutive penalties killed to 12.
Harvard’s huge special teams night didn’t end there. After Ryan Donato’s wrap-around increased the lead to 4-1 in the second period, Malone added a top-shelf turn-around strike in the following frame, marking the Crimson’s second power-play tally of the night. Harvard has now scored two power-play goals in four consecutive games and five of its last six. Its conversion rate sits at 32.1 percent—the best clip in the nation by more than 4 percent.
The Crimson's latest two-goal showing on the man-up was impressively orchestrated without freshman defenseman Adam Fox, who all year has been the lone blue-liner on Harvard's top power play unit. Fox, also the national leader in points per game by a defenseman, is currently in Canada representing Team USA at the World Junior Championships.
In Fox’s absence, Ted Donato at times went back to the five-forward power-play scheme that became the standard for his top unit a year ago. But ultimately, the Crimson's man-up performance on Friday showcased more of Harvard's special teams depth than the strength of one particular unit. The two goal-scorers—Esposito and Malone—are usually members of the second grouping.
With the win, the Crimson moves into a tie for fourth in the ECAC, six points behind first-place Union. Harvard still has between three and four games in hand over all three teams it currently trails in the standings.
“That’s as good of a team as we’ve played this year,” Appert said. “I think they’re a real tenacious team right now.”
GAME NOTES
—Harvard edged the Engineers, 38-31, in shots on goal, and it out-attempted the visitors, 73-59. Ryan Donato led the Crimson with eight shots on goal, a career-high for the sophomore, and 12 attempts in total.
—With Adam Fox out, senior defenseman Clay Anderson moved up a pairing to play alongside sophomore Jacob Olson. Fellow sophomores Adam Baughman and Viktor Dombrovskiy—both left-handed skaters—teamed up on the third pairing, and each finished plus-two on the night.
—After the game, RPI coach Seth Appert talked about a difference he sees between this year’s Harvard team and last’s.
“They played hard last year, don’t get me wrong, [but now] they seem to have more of a chip on their shoulder,” Appert said. “Like ‘we can still be an elite team and be a championship caliber team without [Kyle] Criscuolo and [Jimmy] Vesey,’ two pretty special hockey players. I think they’re not only relying on their skill right now, but they’re relying on their work ethic and their tenacity.”
