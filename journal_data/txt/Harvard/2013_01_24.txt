After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first excitedly told Harvard friends and classmates that I would be studying abroad in Buenos Aires for my fall 2012 semester, I did not quite get the upbeat “Bon Voyages!” I was expecting. Reactions were mostly negative. They ranged from: “How could you ever think to leave Harvard for a semester?” to “You can do that during the summer,” and finally the brutal, “The only people that go abroad during the year hate school or have no friends.” Almost every student seemed to think studying abroad during term time is, at best, unnecessary and, at worst, a waste.
Harvard’s Office of International Education website offers statistics that reflect Harvard students’ overall aversion to studying abroad. The most recent numbers, from the 2010-2011 school year, show that only 141 out of Harvard’s roughly 6,400 students went abroad during the school year. More do go abroad during the summer, but the total of Harvard students engaging in international experiences is still strikingly low. Even including summer, only 598 students had had an abroad experience. With the discouragement of classmates and these OIE numbers, I feared perhaps my choice to go to Argentina might be a bad one. I said a gloomy, “Hasta luego” to all.
However, now that I have completed my fall semester in Buenos Aires and am preparing for my spring semester back on campus, I believe urgently and whole-heartedly that more Harvard students need to study internationally, especially during term time. The negative reaction and culture that surrounds studying abroad at Harvard is close-minded and shallow. Harvard students tend to get so obsessed with the Harvard world that they begin to have no interest in exploring the outside one. For such an international and diverse school, it seems wrong that so few of us stray outside our comfort zones.
Of course, my time abroad was not perfect, and there were moments when I yearned for the sound of the Lowell bells instead of the incessant reggaeton blasting from the streets outside my window. But my experience taught me so many things in just a few months that I never would have learned in the classroom. Seeing thousands of Argentines banging pots and pans on the streets in opposition to President Cristina Kirchner showed me a protest movement very different than Occupy Wall Street. On a trip to Paraguay with my program, we visited a torture chamber created by dictator Alfredo Stroessner to hold anyone suspected of communist beliefs during Operation Condor. Listening to an old prisoner and touring the grounds where countless people had suffered taught me much more about the importance of democracy and freedom of thought than any Gen Ed ever could.
Living in a completely different culture and having no choice but to speak in Spanish was both challenging and stimulating. I became stronger because of the difficult days when I could not communicate with my host family no matter how hard I tried. When our conversations did flow easily, I became more aware of politics and problems I had never known about before. I now am lucky enough to have friends who live in a completely different part of the world. Before I went to Argentina, “long distance” implied the Quad.
Studying abroad during the school year is the only way to combat the epidemic of FOMO (“fear of missing out”) that plagues this campus. Many students I talked to stressed that they were afraid to go abroad. They were nervous they would miss something gigantic or would return to find everyone had forgotten them. This is a silly and irrational obstacle. Leaving Harvard for a semester does not mean leaving Harvard forever. We do not have to be at every event, go to every party, or be in every Harvard-Yale Instagram photo.
There are two tangible reasons why studying abroad during the year makes more sense than traveling over the summer. Firstly, a few months in a country is more enriching than a few weeks. It is only with committed time and constant interaction that one can feel deeply immersed in a place. When departure is only a few weeks away, it is hard to feel settled or at home. Secondly, studying abroad during the year is a better bet financially. Financial aid follows a student during term time or a year abroad. While there are funding sources to study during the summer, it is not guaranteed.
Going away is perhaps not for everyone. Maybe you have a job or too many requirements for your concentration to take time away. You may have taken a gap year and thought that was enough. Or maybe you just don’t like to travel, which is perfectly understandable with the state of airplane food today. But there should still be more of us taking the chance to do something off the beaten path. Coming back to school now, I feel I have a very necessary perspective. I think less about all of my little Harvard complaints (Lamont café sandwiches, for example) and instead am excited to embrace all the opportunities that our school offers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For me, as for many, my high school years were spent in preparation for acceptance into a prestigious university. Surrounded by students with similar goals and impressive qualifications, stress became a ritual part of my daily life. The day I received the letter saying that I was accepted into Harvard, however, I felt as if all my stress had suddenly dissipated. Little did I know of the pressures that I would encounter upon walking through those iron gates.
On the day of my freshman convocation, Dean Michael D. Smith stood in front of the Class of 2015 and issued a powerful phrase: “Don’t compare, connect.” While I did not recognize it at the time, his speech undoubtedly held the typical Harvard student in mind—competitive, and obsessed with perfection. With this simple, three-word truth, therefore, Dean Smith addressed a critical cause of Harvard’s problem with stress—the “Type A” personality.
The Type A personality refers to those individuals with a high level of ambition and drive, qualities often branding them with the terms “over-achievers” or “workaholics.” According to studies by the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, Type A personalities are at an increased risk for strokes due to higher propensities for stress. That is to say, stress is an inexorable counterpart for this personality type.
Nowadays, stress among college students has literally become nearly as common as back pain or allergies. Combine this with the fact that Newsweek ranks Harvard as the fourth most stressful university in the country, and you are hard pressed to find a student on campus that is not inundated with some sort of academic or social pressure. In a sea of the best and brightest, competition becomes inevitable amongst students on our campus.
Some students, and even a Crimson staff editorial, have called attention to flaws in the University Health Services’ response to stress and mental health. In addition, in a three-part article in The Crimson on mental health published this past December, students expressed their frustration with the Harvard’s perfectionist culture, maintaining that constant exposure to the exceptional achievements of their peers leads to general “feelings of inadequacy.”
But perhaps the root of this issue also lies with the students themselves and their search for unattainable perfection.
On the surface, there may seem to be a quick fix for the problem at hand—students should avoid hyper-focusing on their intelligence or capability to withstand academic rigor in comparison to that of others. The unfortunate truth, however, is that convincing Type A students in a Type A environment to shed feelings of inadequacy is essentially asking them to reverse an inherent character trait. In fact, it is likely that this very desire to overachieve has allowed Harvard students to succeed thus far.
Because Harvard students are competitive by nature, however, they must in turn develop healthy means of coping with the inevitable stressors they encounter here on campus.
According to Helpguide.org, an online non-profit resource that provides mental health advice, the four critical methods of coping with stress are to avoid, alter, accept, or adapt to the stressor. Since it is virtually implausible to either avoid or alter Harvard’s ultra-competitive environment, we as students are left with two options: to accept the reality of this unhealthy form of competition, or to adapt by changing our perspective altogether.
Instead of convincing ourselves, for instance, of the need to match or outperform our peers, we must recognize that, as Harvard students, we are fortunate enough to have some of the most innovative and intelligent minds at our fingertips. While Type A personalities, therefore, may still view the student next to them as competition, they can also choose to view him or her as a resource to assist their own progress and success.
Lastly, perhaps the best way to adapt to the Harvard environment is to adjust our notion of what it means to be successful and ensure that we are not always falling short of our own impossible standards. In the closing of The Crimson’s series on mental health, for instance, one student, going by the name of Christine, calls for her peers to “embrace the reality that no one is perfect” and “remember that everyone falls short of perfection."
In track and field, even though a runner may not win the race, they can still achieve a “P.B.,” or “personal best.” Whether or not they receive a first place medal, therefore, running a P.B. is still an indication of success. In this same way, we must try to define our personal best and use this as our standard for achievement.
Granted, feelings of incompetence will resurface throughout our time at Harvard, and it is important not only to ask for help, but also to be comfortable doing so whenever we feel overwhelmed. As the new semester approaches, however, we must try to remember that we cannot do better than our best and that our best is more than enough. With this notion in mind, we can emerge from the stress of this university and call ourselves what we are, a success.

Apparently the Undergraduate Council referendum to divest from fossil fuels is impossible, and many Harvard students don’t do math. At least, that is what a recent Wall Street Journal opinion article “Harvard Needs Remedial Energy Math” implies. According to Robert Bryce, Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the numerous energy experts he cites, alternative energy, such as wind and solar, can never be plentiful enough to keep pace with the world’s increased energy usage (as much as 121 percent since the 1980s). Bryce says the 72 percent of voting undergrads who chose to divest from fossil fuels did not look at the numbers behind our energy needs. His point is clear: We need fossil fuels.
At least that is what I think he was trying to say; all the fractions kept on confusing me. But beneath all the statistics, Bryce might be onto something—maybe we were not looking too closely when we voted to divest from fossil fuels.
Or maybe I am using the communal we here unjustly. Maybe I am the only one who didn’t spend much time when I voted on the measure. I did not do any research. I did not pull out my calculator, my abacus, or my smart friend who can do math in his head. I did not even read the whole measure; I only skimmed the summary of the ballot (perhaps Bryce should write an op-ed about how we don’t read). I saw “fossil fuel” and I voted as any student who recycles when convenient has been conditioned to: in favor of divestment.
I was proud of myself for doing my 10-second part to save the environment and celebrated with a half dozen paper cups filled with dining hall coffee. You’re welcome, ice caps. I did not think twice about the consequence of my vote or if divestment was even possible. I trusted that since I voted against evil, against fossil fuels, I had done right.
Supporting environmentalism, the green movement, and divestment has become the norm, a social law that we obey at the risk of destroying the planet and upsetting Prius owners. We support them because we are supposed to, because green is good, oil is bad, four legs good and two legs bad. We are programmed to support the green movement without thinking.
Our votes have consequences, even if we refuse to think about them. In this case the administration chose to ignore our mandate, but this is not always the case. Imagine if members of Congress didn’t think when voting on health care or economic policy, ignored the substance of a bill, and only looked at trigger words that told them how they should vote. That would lead to gridlock and government immobility. We expect our leaders to make informed decisions. There is no reason we shouldn’t hold ourselves to that same high standard.
It’s not really our fault. We have been programmed to take short cuts, skim readings, and multitask. Why shouldn’t we? We barely have enough time to sleep as it is. So why should we take the time to research every country’s energy consumption or study the background of every UC candidate? That time could be spent sleeping or perhaps reading the news while listening to a lecture while doing Zumba.
Yet, we (just me again?) could have spent a little more than two minutes voting on the UC ballot. Skimming referenda and voting for friends and people with catchy names seems like a slap in the face to those students who invested months working on their campaigns and drafting measures. We could spend a little more time looking into it.
If you won’t do it for them do it for yourself. We have a reputation to uphold and not the Elle Woods “Legally Blonde” one. We look bad when we don’t think. It’s embarrassing when people like Bryce chide us in the Wall Street Journal.
Worst of all, most of us cannot even defend our position. We cannot support our decision, we have no facts, have done no research, and apparently don’t do math. The debate team should be horrified. We need stronger defenses than “I had a good feeling about this one,” “The sentence I skimmed had a nice font,” and “Eenie meenie moe never fails.” We have to admit that yes, maybe we could have done a little more research, or at the very least given the measure some thoughtful consideration.
Maybe Bryce is wrong, maybe divestment is completely possible, and he needs to redo his own math. However, we will never know unless we look into it ourselves. It is unreasonable of the student body to expect the administration to make drastic changes without fully understanding or even considering the implications of what we are asking it to do.

It is a national truism: The United States government has money problems. Less recognized, however, is that federal research spending isn’t one of them. Unfortunately, funding for research at universities such as Harvard remains a prime target for slashing in the impending budget battle to resolve the coming sequestration cuts.
Currently, Harvard receives approximately $656 million in federal sponsorship, or 16 percent of the university’s budget. The upcoming federal sequestration, postponed to March 1 by a patchwork New Year’s bill, threatens an 8.2 percent cut in non-defense discretionary spending, although it is unclear precisely how those cuts would fall. In some scenarios, Harvard could lose much more than 8.2 percent, or roughly $55 million, of its funding.
That would be regrettable in multiple respects, not the least of which is that research and development spending is far from a long-term fiscal threat. Federal research and development spending has fallen from 1.08 percent of GDP in 2003 to 0.90 percent in 2012, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, during a ten-year period when total federal outlays rose from 19.7 percent of GDP to over 24 percent by 2012.
The logic of sequestration is to present a default alternative detrimental enough to spur a deal for averting it. However, a bipartisan failure to solve the core issues facing long-run U.S. budgets—entitlement spending (especially health-care related) in an upward tailspin; historically low and inefficient revenue collection; a Brobdingnagian defense budget yet to be reined in—has left worthy discretionary programs, like Harvard’s R&D, on the Congressional chopping block. That is a sad, Faustian bargain.
Research and development is an especially potent example of Congressional myopia. While costly in the short run, research is an essential driver of long-term economic growth. According to a study published in the American Economic Review, “increased research intensity” in the United States (plus four other developed countries examined) accounts for approximately half of all economic growth from 1950 to 1993. And it has long been acknowledged that an economy cannot rely solely on private actors for optimal R&D investment. As Nobel laureate economist Kenneth Arrow explained over fifty years ago, “We expect a free enterprise economy to underinvest in invention and research (as compared with an ideal) because it is risky, because the product can be appropriated only to a limited extent, and because of increasing returns in use.” Perhaps most importantly, he noted, “This underinvestment will be greater for more basic research.”
Basic research, as opposed to applied research or development, may be the most crucial in the long term, as it fuels our general advancement of knowledge, yet it operates farthest from the store shelf or the patent office. The need for federal funding is evident empirically. Federal contributions accounted for only 26 percent of total R&D spending in 2008 but funded 57 percent of basic research. In recent months, President Faust has said that Harvard might look to private sources to supplant its federal funding; do not expect replacements to fill the gaps in basic research.
Thus far, the U.S. government has failed to value long-term economic concerns over short-term internecine squabbling. We sincerely hope that a fresh deal can be reached by the end of February: one that attacks economic prosperity’s true threats and leaves its engines of growth unmarred—not the other way around.

The Harvard Theological Review continues to hold off on publishing the long-awaited article on the so-called “Gospel of Jesus’s Wife,” a scrap of papyrus that if authenticated would provide evidence that some early Christians believed Jesus was married.
The article was originally slated to be printed in the publication’s January 2013 edition, but was held as scientific testing of the controversial papyrus continued.
First announced at a September conference in Rome by Harvard Divinity School professor Karen L. King, the papyrus fragment contains a Coptic phrase that translates to “Jesus said to them, my wife...”
Since then, the Vatican and academics have denounced the artifact as a forgery, pointing to the grammatical similarities between the fragment and another ancient document, the gnostic Gospel of Thomas. These similarities, scholars argue, suggest that the papyrus was not written in the fourth century.
According to Kathryn Dodgson, director of communications at HDS, the publication is waiting to print King’s article while the papyrus undergoes scientific analysis.
Once she receives the results of that analysis, King will incorporate them into the article for the Harvard Theological Review, Dodgson wrote in an email.
Currently analysts are testing the ink on the fragment to confirm that it dates from the fourth century like the papyrus itself, which has already been tested.
King could not be reached for comment on this article.
Scholars said that even if the scientific analysis confirms the ink’s age, questions about the authenticity of the artifact may remain.
Gregory E. Sterling, dean of Yale Divinity School, said problems arise from the fact that little is known about the circumstances of the fragment’s discovery. Because the papyrus comes from the collections of an anonymous donor, rather than from an archaeological dig, authentication is more difficult, he said.
Other scholars pointed out similarities between King’s papyrus and the Gospel of Thomas.
“It really is unbelievably close to the Gospel of Thomas,” said Mark S. Goodacre, an associate professor at Duke University and an expert on early Christian texts. “We’re talking about literally every word, with a few gender changes.”
Janet A. Timbie, an expert in Coptic language and literature who teaches at the Catholic University of America, said that although the two texts are extremely similar, their resemblance does not necessarily disprove the fragment’s authenticity because “people often rework material in the ancient world.”
Even so, Timbie said she thought the text was likely faked.
Scholars and King agree that even if the academic community does eventually accept the authenticity of the fragment, because it comes from the fourth century the papyrus would not give definitive information about what Jesus did in his time.
“It would tell us something about the fourth century, but not about the first century,” said Sterling. “This just shows how people later thought about this.”

In a flu season that has seen the declaration of a public health emergency in Boston in response to an unsually large number of cases in the city, members of the Harvard community have clamored to get vaccinated against the virus.
Though Harvard has not yet seen an outbreak of the flu on campus, University Health Services has taken steps to keep students healthy this flu season.
At its most recent clinic on Jan. 15, UHS vaccinated 500 people. In total, UHS has vaccinated 13,000 people since the end of August, according to UHS spokesperson Lindsey Baker.
UHS held weekly vaccination clinics for most of the fall semester, and during winter break Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds sent students an email encouraging them to get vaccinated before returning to campus and noting that UHS had a “limited supply” of the vaccine.
UHS also plans to offer another vaccination clinic on Monday, Jan. 28. Although Baker confirmed that there will be a limited supply of vaccinations at the clinic, she did not specify the number of vaccines that would be available.
The limited supply of vaccine at Harvard has been felt by the greater Boston community as well. Shortages have been reported throughout the city since Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino declared a state of emergency on Jan. 9 in response to the 700 flu confirmed cases in the city since the start of October. In comparison, there were just 70 flu cases confirmed in the entire year of 2011.
Although this flu season has been especially intense and peaked earlier than usual in Boston, it may not necessarily be a so-called “outbreak,” according to Thomas J. Sandora, assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
Even so, Sandora emphasized the importance of getting the flu vaccine, in addition to taking other preventive measures such as hand-washing and staying away from others when sick—especially on a college campus where students live in close quarters and infectious diseases may spread more easily.
“The vaccine is the best thing we have to protect you against getting the flu,” Sandora said.
Joshua R. Wortzel ’13 received the vaccine at the UHS clinic on Jan. 15 after trying unsuccessfully to get vaccinated at CVS, which he had been told had exhausted its supply. Wortzel said he arrived at the UHS clinic a few minutes early, not anticipating a large crowd. By the time Wortzel arrived, however, the line—which started on the second floor of UHS in Holyoke Center—extended all the way to the front foyer on the ground level. By the time he had reached the second floor, he said he could see through the window that the queue had snaked out the building and around the block near the Garage.
“People were certainly pretty concerned about this,” Wortzel said. “They were willing to wait in a really long line.”
Wortzel said he was satisfied with his experience at the clinic. He noted, however, that some of the officials at UHS appeared to be surprised by the size of the turnout.
And some Harvard affiliates in line may not have even needed the vaccine. Wortzel said several students in line—himself included—got vaccinated that day even though were not sure whether or not they had already received the vaccine at a previous doctor’s visit.

When Stephen Lassonde takes the helm of the Office of Student Life in March, he will encounter issues similar to many he faced in his previous posts, including a changing residential environment and a disciplinary system that many have described as misguided.
Lassonde, deputy dean of the college at Brown, was named Harvard College’s new dean of student life last week. He brings with him over 20 years of experience as an administrator and educator at other Ivy League institutions.
At Brown, Lassonde enhanced the undergraduate advising system and reformed the deliberative procedures of the school’s Committee on Academic Standing.
“Over the past five and a half years, [Lassonde] has worked tirelessly to improve the quality of the academic support we offer to Brown faculty and students,” wrote Katherine Bergeron, dean of the college at Brown, in an email announcing Lassonde’s departure from the school.
Lassonde will take on a different set of responsibilities as Harvard’s dean of student life. In the position, he will oversee matters related to undergraduates’ lives outside of the classroom, an experience largely defined by their House affiliation.
Lassonde comes to the College during a critical time of transformation for the House system as the University continues planned renovation to Harvard’s Houses that began last year.
But Lassonde is no stranger to the challenges posed by House renewal. Prior to assuming his current position at Brown in 2007, Lassonde spent 14 years at Yale as a history lecturer and dean of Calhoun College, one of Yale’s 12 residential colleges. During his tenure at Calhoun, Yale embarked on a renovation of all of its residential colleges.
“I was struck with the similarity in the process to Yale,” Lassonde said.
Just as at Harvard, student input fueled plans for the redesigned buildings, Lassonde said. And Yale administrators also grappled with the accessibility of common spaces in the colleges—a common complaint among Harvard undergraduates.
“He definitely has very relevant experience, especially with House renewal,” said Danny P. Bicknell ’13, former Undergraduate Council president who served on the search committee that hired Lassonde.
In addition, Bicknell said that Lassonde has experience in issues of academic integrity, a pertinent matter following the recent investigation of cheating in the course Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress.”
As many criticize the Administrative Board, Harvard’s disciplinary body, for being insensitive to students’ perspectives, Bicknell said that Lassonde hopes to make the process “supportive of students.”
One of Lassonde’s greatest pushes at Brown was to bridge the gap between administrators and students. Lassonde held office hours in non-traditional locations such as gyms where students were already congregated.
“He can lead the OSL to be a more accessible office, reenvision it, revitalize it, especially because it’s been through a lot of turnovers,” Bicknell said.
Tara Raghuveer ’14, president of the UC, was also involved in the selection process.
“I think Dean Lassonde will bring a lot of necessary leadership and perspective and move the OSL to a great direction,” Raghuveer said. “[He’ll be an] advocate for students.”
At a place like Harvard, Lassonde said, students may arrive with feelings of inadequacy.
“It is critical that we help our students overcome that feeling as soon as possible by making clear how we can help them and to respond in a timely way,” Lassonde wrote in an emailed statement.

About 45 members of the Allston-Brighton community gathered at noon on Wednesday at the construction site of the relocated Charlesview Residences housing complex to celebrate the progress of the ahead-of-schedule building project.
Members of Charlesview’s Board of Directors unveiled the ceremonial cornerstone at the site, which is projected to be ready for residents to move in by this summer, ahead of the original October 2013 target date.
The ceremony, which was shortened due to temperatures in the low teens, took place at 370 Western Ave., in an unfinished structure that will soon become the Josephine A. Fiorentino Community Center. The Center will serve as a gathering place for both residents of the new complex and the entire Allston-Brighton community.
“This is really the beginning of many celebrations,” event organizer Jo-Ann Barbour said in an interview after the ceremony.
Barbour, who is the executive director of Charlesview, Inc., said nearly all the residents of the existing Charlesview site have elected to move to the new, larger one, which will contain 240 apartments.
“Every resident that wants to move here will move here,” she said.
Barbour also explained that the Community Center, which is named after the founder of Charlesview, Inc., will serve as a hub for the entire community and include a computer center, arts center, multipurpose rooms, and services such as college counseling and other family programs.
The new property, which sits across the street from the Brighton Mills Shopping Center, is several blocks away from the old housing complex, adjacent to Harvard Business School. The old site’s location made it attractive to the University. Harvard obtained it from Charlesview’s Board of Directors in 2007. In exchange, Charlesview received the new site, which officials at Wednesday’s event praised for its location embedded in the Allston-Brighton community.
But that agreement has provoked some anger and confusion among residents and members of the wider community.
Construction on the new site—which is being co-developed by Charlesview, Inc., and The Community Builders, Inc., a nonprofit developer of mixed-income housing—began in May 2011. And on Wednesday, Barbour said that the unveiling was “one way to begin to mark this four-year journey.”
She explained to the group that the original Charlesview Residences were founded by a group of religious organizations, whose names also appeared on the cornerstone unveiled Wednesday. Representatives from St. Anthony’s Catholic Church, Congregation Kadimah-Toras Moshe, and Community United Methodist Church, many of whom also sit on Charlesview’s Board of Directors, were present at the event and spoke to the crowd.
Father Frank Glynn of St. Anthony’s, who is also chairman of the Board, voiced excitement about the Community Center’s construction.
He described the Center as “a labor of love and...a commitment to the Allston-Brighton community.”
He also extolled the warmth of the group that had gathered despite the crude state of the room and the freezing temperature.
“I’ve been in many elegant pulpits in my time,” Glynn said. “And I’m really enjoying where I’m standing now.”
Also at the event, Rev. Jeffrey Hooker of Community United gave an opening prayer, and Rabbi Yonah Berman from Kadimah-Toras Moshe offered a benediction.
Harvard also had a presence at the event. Materials distributed at the event described the University as a financing partner, and Mary-Helen Black of Harvard Public Affairs and Communications delivered brief remarks.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Jan. 25
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that nonprofit developer The Community Builders, Inc., co-founded the original Charlesview Residences. In fact, while The Community Builders is co-developing the new relocated Charlesview Residences, it was not involved in establishing the original housing complex.

Speaking at a panel in the Science Center on Tuesday about careers in sports management, former Crimson pitcher William “Ben” Crockett ’02 paused for a long moment before answering a question about his days working as a front office intern with the Boston Red Sox.
Crockett leaned back in his chair, stroked his temple, and finally said, “In my first year as an intern, I started in February, and I had my first day off during the All-Star break in July. Working 100-hour weeks was the norm with a stipend that, at the time, was below minimum wage.”
But Crockett said that the long hours of his job were worthwhile and ultimately rewarding. Today, he is Director of Player Development for the Red Sox.
Crockett was joined on the Harvard Alumni Association-sponsored panel by three other alumni, all of whom have also parlayed successful Harvard athletic careers into new professional jobs in the world of sports management.
Panelist and former Crimson shortstop Edwin “Ed” M. Durso ’75, now the executive vice president of ESPN, echoed Crockett’s comments about the work ethic required to move up in the industry.
“Where I worked, 100-hour weeks were expected,” Durso said. “If you didn’t do that, they’d pick up the phone and ask ‘Where’s the next person in line?’”
Panelists also characterized sports management as an industry in which athletic excellence need not be a prerequisite for employment. All of them told stories about their own winding paths to post-college sports management careers.
Originally drafted by the Red Sox in the tenth round in 2001, Crockett chose to return to Harvard for his senior year and was then drafted in the third round by the Colorado Rockies in 2002. Crockett was a minor league shortstop for the Rockies’ farm affiliates for four years, logging starts for twelve different teams and making a AAA appearance in 2005. After being released in 2006, Crockett played independent ball before taking an internship with the Red Sox in 2007.
Durso—who entered the sports world first as a television reporter but got his first job with the Red Sox as a lawyer—also said there is not just one way to get into sports. Pointing out that only one person can reach the privileged positions of owner or general manager, Durso advised students not to narrow their focus and instead follow their passions to get a job in the industry.
Panelist Angela M. Ruggiero ’02, a four-time Olympic medalist who was on the Olympic women’s hockey team as a high school teenager, now works on the International Olympic Committee’s Athletes’ Association. Recalling what she described as a “pack mentality” at Harvard in thinking about post-college employment, Ruggiero encouraged students to pursue their passions instead of the careers of others.
“One thing I’ve tried to do my entire life, both as an athlete and then professionally in business, is trust myself,” Ruggerio said. “People have been telling me my entire life to do things, but I learned to listen to myself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is in the process of reengaging the architect who originally had been tapped six years ago to design a new science complex in Allston the first time the plan was proposed.
At a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Wednesday evening, Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey announced that Harvard is working to bring architect Stefan Behnisch back into the fold as the University restarts development on the planned hub of innovation and scientific work.
Harvard originally filed plans for Allston development in 2007, proposing, among other projects, renovation of Barry’s Corner and a $1 billion science complex to be designed by Behnisch. After putting these plans on hold in wake of the 2009 economic downturn, the University announced that it would resume planning development in the area and filed a new draft of its Institutional Master Plan for Allston development this past October. That draft was met with opposition from some residents, who filed a letter criticizing what they characterized as ambiguous and problematic plans.
And in Wednesday’s meeting, tensions ran high as many attendees called for swifter development and more details about the complex.
Task Force member Brent C. Whelan asked about the inclusion of parking space and the scope of public access at the site, calling these factors “absolutely fundamental” to gauging the impact of development on the surrounding Allston community. Like other residents of Allston, he also voiced concern about the “complex and massive” need for transportation restructuring.
Casey, on the other hand, heralded Behnisch’s return to the project as a step forward that is, in fact, ahead of Harvard’s original schedule for resuming development on the science complex.
“We continue to make progress even though [the completion of the project] is a little out of sight,” Casey said.
Another point of contention at the meeting, which also had been debated at the Task Force’s previous meeting in December, was the proposed relocation of various landscaping, storage, and other University facilities from 219 Western Ave. to 28 Travis St.
Residents said that they were concerned about how this development could impact the neighborhood’s atmosphere and cohesiveness.
“It’s the kind of facility that just doesn’t mix well with a residential community,” said Bruce E. Houghton, a Task Force member and Allston resident.
Speaking more broadly, Harry E. Mattison, another resident and member of the Task Force, said that Harvard needs to earn the trust of Allston residents.
That sentiment was echoed by attendees who argued that Harvard has not been completely transparent in its planning.
“What is it that’s being deliberated behind closed doors?” asked one man in the group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 24, 2012, at 10:40 p.m.
The Institute of Politics announced on Thursday a spring roster of residential and visiting fellows that includes prominent politicians, journalists, and political advisors.
Former governor and presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, Jr., former U.S. Senator Timothy E. Wirth ’61, and CNN’s chief national correspondent John King will all spend several weeks on campus this semester as visiting fellows.
In this role they are expected to interact with student groups, host discussions, and attend public policy classes on campus.
“[The IOP] has always been the marquee political laboratory and discussion center,” King said. In his talks, King plans to highlight the changing American demographic.
The resident fellows will live on campus for the semester and lead weekly study groups during the spring term for undergraduates and members of the Harvard community.
Former ambassador Karen Hughes, who also served as a counselor to former President George W. Bush, and former North Carolina governor Beverly “Bev” E. Perdue headline this class of resident fellows.
“My study group is going to be wrapped around policy and entrepreneurship,” said Perdue who compared public policy to tech-startups. “Public policy is really policy entrepreneurship.”
It is this approach to politics on which Perdue intends to focus during her time in Cambridge.
Hughes, a political communications expert, will work with the Harvard community to plan for her fellowship.
“I’m planning to meet with students during my orientation weeks to see where I could best share my expertise,” she said.
Hughes and Perdue will be joined by John Murray, former deputy chief of staff to U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Eric Cantor, and Stephen “Steve” Kerrigan, CEO of the 2012 Democratic National Convention Committee.
Washington Post reporter Keith Richburg and Charles “Charlie” E. Cook, Jr. of The National Journal will contribute a journalistic perspective to the group.
IOP Director C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 noted that Richburg, a China correspondent for The Washington Post from 2009 to 2013, and Huntsman, who served as U.S. Ambassador to China for two years, bring with them knowledge of international relations with China, a topic which recently has generated heightened student interest.
“We have heard from students all across campus with an interest in China,” said Grayson, who added that the IOP will likely host a forum with Richburg and Huntsman.
“Engaging with China is clearly one of our most important relationships in the world,” Hughes said.
According to Grayson, the applicant pool this semester was one of the most competitive in recent years. But he said he was not surprised by the increased interest in the program since many of the journalists who applied had just finished covering political campaigns during the 2012 election year.
“I’ve covered seven presidential races. I have experience covering the nation. I take pride in getting out of Washington and traveling the country,” King said.
Cook, known for publishing the Cook Political Report which analyzes congressional race, also brings a knowledge of national politics. King described him as “an encyclopedia of Congress.”
As leading political experts, the spring 2013 rotation of IOP fellows will likely face tough questions. At least one fellow has set her aims high for her stay at Harvard.
“I was so privileged to have the opportunity to serve my country and I want to have the opportunity to give back and inspire the next generation,” said Hughes. “There’s a lot of discussion about the role of women in politics and how we can expand that role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior captain Adabelle Ekechukwu wasted no time in letting her competitors know that she is a force to be reckoned with in 2013.
Ekechukwu’s performance in the weight throw ring at Gordon Indoor Track on Saturday not only earned her first place in the event, but also shattered her own school record by over 0.3 meters. With a mark of 19.22 meters, the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor, became the first woman in Harvard history to eclipse 19 meters in the weight throw.
“I'm happy with how I opened up,” Ekechukwu said. “I've been chasing a certain distance for a while, and it's nice seeing myself getting closer to my goal…. [The Harvard Challenge] was like reaching a checkpoint in the grander scheme of things.”
But Ekechukwu was not the only athlete on her squad to kick off the season in a strong fashion. In total, the Crimson men and women set five school records at the Harvard Challenge en route to a pair of team victories over Army, Northeastern, Brown, MIT, and Williams. The Harvard men finished with 78.5 points while the women’s team scored 112.5 on the day.
“I think [breaking five school records] says a lot about what’s to come,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “This early in the year, we’re still knocking out the roster and working out some kinks, so I really think this is just a taste of what’s to come. I could see that record board having to do a pretty major facelift by the time the year’s done.”
On the women’s side, sophomore middle distance runner Molly Renfer joined Ekechukwu in earning a spot in the record books. Renfer cruised to a victory in the 1000-meter run with a program-best time of 2:49.06. Her nearest competitor, the Black Knight’s Jennifer Comfort, finished nearly four seconds later, allowing Renfer to pick up seven team points for Harvard.
Junior Morgan Kelly, who was recently named the women’s cross country captain for next season, took home first place in the 3000-meter run, just missing the 10-minute mark with a finish of 10:01.15. Kelly’s cross country teammate, sophomore Viviana Hanley, also earned points in the 3000 by finishing in fourth place at the season opener.
Perhaps the most impressive event for the women’s team was the 500-meter run, in which sophomores Erika Veidis and Gabrielle Scott as well as freshman Autumne Franklin turned in a 1-2-3 finish. Veidis led the way for the Crimson by breaking the school record in the event with a time of 1:13.28.
“Right from the gun, it was very clear that the Harvard women were taking control of the race,” Saretsky said. “Erika had a fantastic finish to get under that school record. But the most exciting part is that [the 500-meter run] is not even her primary event, she’s more of an 800 runner, so I think that she’ll get even stronger as the distance goes up.”
Not to be outdone by her throwing and middle distance counterparts, sophomore sprinter Danielle Barbian set the school record in the preliminary heat of the 60-meter dash. Barbian ran a time of 7.61 seconds in the preliminaries and went on to win the event with a 7.70 in the final heat.
On the men’s side, the Harvard throwers picked up right where they left off in the 2012 season. Junior Dustin Brode teamed up with sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich to finish 1-2-3 in the shot put and 1-2-4 in the weight throw. Brode took home the top spot in the former with a hurl of 17.09 meters, and Glauser took the helm in the weight throw with a 18.62-meter toss.
“Coach [Andrew] Dubs has done a phenomenal job with our throwers,” Saretsky said. “Sometimes it’s a more challenging coaching task to take a group that has had success and make them even more successful. But that group has bought it; they believe in the training that they’re doing.”
Dubs, who replaced Cathrine Eriksen as the Crimson’s throwing coach this season, is also earning praise from his athletes.
“Coach Dubs has been amazing,” Ekechukwu said. “He had a great college career and is so easy to talk to, so it's been easier understanding and trusting the advice he gives. I've had two years to learn the fundamentals, but I'm really glad he's here now to help make things click.”
Sophomore Jarvis Harris also had a noteworthy outing on Saturday, capturing two event titles with a pair of personal-best marks. Harris broke the school record that he set as a freshman in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 8.02 seconds. The Ama, La. native then went on to win the triple jump with a leap of 14.8 meters, 0.65 meters farther than the event’s second-place finisher.
“Jarvis had a great day,” Saretsky said. “There are definitely things he knows he can improve on and things he can clean up, but I’m expecting some great things from Jarvis. I think it’s going to be a very exciting year for him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the saying may be “home sweet home,” the return back to Houston was anything but sweet for Jeremy Lin’s Rockets. The squad picked up its eighth loss in nine games, falling to the Denver Nuggets, 105-95.
The combination of a low shooting percentage and turnovers continued to plague Houston, as it shot under 45 percent from the field and tallied 23 turnovers, 17 of which came from its starting unit. Those 23 mistakes proved especially costly for the Rockets, as Denver was able to convert them into easy buckets. The Nuggets totaled 28 points off turnovers on the night, 26.7 percent of their total offensive output.
“[Denver] got some run-outs when we weren't getting back on defense,” Houston coach Kevin McHale said. “It's been like that for a while. It just snowballs with us…We’re not able to pull ourselves out of those minor tailspins.”
In 24 minutes of playing time, Lin put up nine points on three-of-seven shooting, along with three assists and a single rebound. It was the second straight game that Lin played less than 25 minutes, a marked difference from his usual thirty-plus minutes on the floor.
Wednesday night’s game was notable for two other reasons though, both of which involved reaching major milestones—Nuggets guard and veteran Andre Iguodala reached 10,000 career points while his coach, George Karl, notched his 1,000th win as a head coach.
Lin’s team will have one night off before heading back on the road to face the struggling New Orleans Hornets on Friday. As the Portland Trail Blazers won their contest on Wednesday, the Rockets are back in a gridlock for the eighth and final playoff position in the Western Conference.

The Harvard men’s tennis team will depart the cold Cambridge weather for Norman, Okla. to join Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and Memphis in the ITA Kick-Off this weekend.
The No. 28 Crimson will first take on the No. 30 Fighting Irish on Friday, and either the No. 8 Sooners or the No. 31 Tigers on Saturday, depending on the results of the first match.
“All four teams in this tournament are some of the top teams in the nation,” sophomore Shaun Chaudhuri said. “Every match is going to be a battle, so you can’t really take anything for granted at this point.”
Harvard and Notre Dame (2-1) will face off for the second time this season, with the first coming in the fall at the Tribe Invitational. The Fighting Irish came out on top in the tournament, winning seven of eight singles matches against the Crimson and taking two of the three doubles matches as well.
Notre Dame opened up its dual match season with a pair of 7-0 wins, but fell earlier this week to No. 37 Northwestern in a 4-3 decision.
The Fighting Irish are led by junior Greg Andrews, who has compiled a 10-5 record on the year and is 3-0 at the No. 1 position. As the Big East Player of the Year last season, Andrews also earned a spot in the 2012 NCAA Singles Championship.
Another top competitor for Notre Dame is senior Blas Moros, who has posted a perfect 12-0 record dating back to the fall campaign.
After taking on the Fighting Irish, Harvard will resume competition the next day against either Oklahoma or Memphis. While the Tigers sit just three spots behind Harvard in the national poll, the Sooners have played their way to a top-10 ranking.
“Oklahoma is very good,” co-captain Andy Nguyen said. “If we beat Notre Dame, we’ll take every match as a learning experience and hopefully we can do our best against [the Sooners].”
Oklahoma (1-0) took down Wichita State earlier this week, winning all nine matches and dropping only three sets.
Senior Costin Paval has proved to be a formidable opponent over the course of his career as a Sooner. Paval was named the ITA preseason No. 6 player in the nation and he has partnered with sophomore Dane Webb to make up the country’s No. 1 doubles squad.
Memphis (1-0), the Crimson’s other potential opponent, came out on top, 6-1, in its last outing against No. 47 Michigan State.
Sophomore Connor Glennon plays at the No. 1 position for the Tigers. The reigning C-USA Co-Freshman of the Year, Glennon put together a 1-3 record this fall against ranked opponents, but managed to pull out a three-set victory against the Spartans.
Harvard’s lineup is still in flux as a minor groin injury to sophomore Denis Nguyen has made him questionable to play. If Nguyen is forced to sit, Chaudhuri will play at the No. 1 position with sophomore Alex Steinroeder, freshman Nicky Hu and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster filling out the top spots behind him.
The Crimson dominated its opponents this past weekend at the Harvard Winter Invite. Competing against Boston College, Marist, and Fordham, Harvard players took part in 32 matches and claimed victory in 29 of them.
“I’ve been on teams where our top three have been very powerful and our bottom three were not as strong,” Andy Nguyen said. “But having this kind of depth is going to be helpful when we play matches in the spring.”
Although every member of the Crimson team achieved solid results, Denis Nguyen particularly stood out, taking home the singles crown. Nguyen won three singles matches and did not surrender a set.
Chaudhuri contributed another noteworthy performance, winning both of his doubles matches and going 2-1 in singles, with the sole defeat coming to Nguyen in what effectively served as the final.
Overall, Harvard is 44-37 in singles and 21-17 in doubles so far this year, marks that have placed the Crimson amidst other national contenders in the national rankings.
This weekend will be Harvard’s first two dual matches of the season as all of its competition dating back to the fall has come in tournament play.
“We’re not really looking to take too much away from this weekend in terms of results,” Nguyen said. “All of these teams are really good, so if we come away 0-2, it’s not going to mean anything for our season. We’re looking for improvement individually each match so we can work our way towards the Ivy season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After starting off the season with its first shutout opener since 2010, a 7-0 blanking of Cleveland State University, the Harvard women’s tennis team returns to the court this weekend with matchups against William and Mary (3-1) on Friday and Kansas State (0-0) on Sunday.
“We’ve only been practicing about two weeks so it’s been really early but everyone is doing a great job on court,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Right now we need to just get some more matches under our belts. We’ve been practicing hard and the next phase is match play. Once we have that under our belts, we should be ready to move forward and improve.”
Last year, the Crimson snapped a 19-match losing streak to the Tribe with a 5-2 victory. This year, the Tribe come in after its most impressive victory of the season, a 4-3 comeback victory over 19th-ranked Mississippi. William and Mary’s only loss this season came to No. 3 Duke. Harvard and Kansas State have never played each other. Green expects both teams to provide stiff tests for the Crimson.
“Overall, we always try to play a strong schedule and January, February, and March to prepare us for the Ivy season in April,” Green said. “Our goals are to improve over the next few months so that we can be prepared and compete for the Ivy title in April and hopefully compete at the NCAA tournament at the end of the season.”
After dealing with sickness and injuries, the team has constantly adjusted its doubles teams to fit changing lineups. The team has accumulated a 23-13 total record in doubles through the flux at the position. However, the team’s most successful doubles team—co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He—have only played four matches together, posting a 4-0 record.
Co-captain Hideko Tachibana, who has been a fixture on the team’s No. 1 doubles team all semester and plays top line for the team in singles, said that the team has focused on establishing rhythm with a rotating lineup.
“The focus has been the doubles in practice,” Tachibana said. “We’ve tried a lot of different combinations and we’ve been rotating people in and out. In this next match, we will have a completely different lineup than we’ve had in the past.”
Amidst all the turnover—which includes four freshmen who all played in the Crimson’s top six against Cleveland State—Green said that Norton and Tachibana have been key in steadying the team and keeping it focused on its goals, which include winning the Ivy League title.
“Our captains have been fabulous this season,” Green said. “It’s their second season being co-captains and they have learned a lot from their first season as co-captains and we are very fortunate to have them. It’s their last year and we’re going to make the most of it. They’ve taken every day to make sure that they leave a long-lasting legacy for our tennis program.”
Tachibana said that the freshmen have been key to the team’s early success. According to the Austin, Texas native, the culture around the team has changed—with the focus more on the final results instead of how the team plays during the match.
“I would say that there is a lot desire to win this year,” Tachibana said. “Usually in team meetings, we talk about our goals and this year we are more focused on outcome goals whereas last year it was more focused on performance goals. Everyone is really focused on the Ivy League title and that’s really great to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, it took some work, but eventually Jeremy Lin ’10 made the Rookie-Sophomore Challenge at the 2012 All-Star Weekend. This year, expectations were higher as many thought Lin might make the weekend’s main event—Sunday night’s All-Star Game, featuring the best and brightest from both NBA conferences. The anticipation was enhanced by the fact that this season’s festivities are taking place in his team’s home arena in Houston, Tex. But the Harvard alum just missed out on collecting enough fan votes to start in the Game, meaning his only remaining option was to hope that the NBA coaches would select him as an all-star reserve. On Thursday afternoon, live on TNT, the coaches’ choices were revealed. Lin did not make the team.
The lack of inclusion did not come as a surprise to most, who considered the fan’s vote to be his only real shot at collecting a spot on the squad during to an up-and-down season for the third-year guard. Even Lin, after a recent loss to the Dallas Mavericks, responded with a simple “Uh, no” when asked whether he felt he should make the Western Conference team.
While Lin may not have made the cut, fellow Rocket and backcourt-mate James Harden did. Harden will play with former teammates and Oklahoma City Thunder members Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when the games begin on Feb. 17.
