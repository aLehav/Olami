This review contains spoilers for the first two season of “The Good Place.”
A moral philosophy professor, name-dropping philanthropist, amateur DJ/backup dancer, and a self-proclaimed Arizona trashbag all walk into an MRI lab. Oh, and they were all brought back from the dead.
Only Michael Schur, series creator and executive producer, could pull together a punchline for that joke, and he does, returning with the Season Three premiere for “The Good Place” this past Thursday. Picking up where Season Two left off, we see Eleanor (Kristen Bell), Chidi (William Jackson Harper), Tahani (Jameela Jamil), and Jason (Manny Jacinto) back on Earth, each coping with the aftermath of their near-death experience by resolving to change their lifestyle, and then, inevitably, returning to old tendencies. With the help of a misbehaving Michael (Ted Danson) and a frog-loving doorman, the gang is nudged back onto the right track, their only hope for becoming good people once again: finding each other.
The Season Three premiere is heavily reminiscent of the pilot. The staggered chronology that jumps from present-day Eleanor to three-months-ago Chidi back to present-day Chidi then to three-months later Tahani and Jason and then to three-months-later Eleanor is engaging, allowing us to follow these four separate mini-storylines without losing interest in any one of them. And, as in Season One, we are treated to the show’s signature brand of humor, one that’s grounded in and dependent upon its characters.
Schur is not new to this. As executive producer on “The Office,” creator of “Parks and Recreation” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” as well as president of as a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, his comedy-writing legacy is legendary. It makes sense that “The Good Place” continues this legacy.
Eleanor’s perfect score on a Buzzfeed quiz on slang words invented by the Kardashians, Chidi’s inability to ask a girl on a date until he is literally inside an MRI machine, Tahani’s best-selling book on how to avoid the spotlight, Jason admitting to robbery by trying to propose to a police officer—we know these characters, and these are exactly the kinds of things we expect from each one of them. Yet the show manages to find new wild predicaments or timely references (“[Arizona’s] top exports are racist sheriffs and HPV”) to make us laugh at and love the characters even more.
Amid the jokes and jabs and pop culture references, the show still manages to carry a plot with high stakes (literally, heaven or hell). Shawn (Marc Evan Jackson) and his team of demon hackers (under the constant threat of being turned into a giant cocoon) works to foil Michael’s attempt to give the gang a second chance. At the heart of the show, however, remains Eleanor and Chidi. They say opposites attract, and there’s something about a moral philosophy professor and a fake pharmaceutical salesperson that makes for a wonderful friendship. Their personalities clash in the best of ways, Chidi keeping Eleanor from doing unethical things and Eleanor calling him a dork every time he does. Whether it can be more than a friendship, however, seems less likely, what with what seems to be Chidi’s actual soulmate Simone (Kirby Howell-Baptiste), a neuroscience professor, joining the team.
“The Good Place” seems to be, much like Schur’s previous work, a comedic masterpiece. It manages to combine moral philosophy with cognitive neuroscience, sadistic demons with semi-sentient androids, and, most importantly, humor with story. I look forward to the rest of the season to find out not only whether Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason can actually get to the real Good Place or whether Michael and Janet (D'Arcy Carden) will get caught by the judge, but also whether will.i.am will show up on the book cruise, whether the doorman will use his new antimatter thermos, and whether Eleanor will ever learn how to pronounce Chipotle.

“La Reine de Saba,” a grand five act opera composed by Charles Gounod in 1862, reentered the stage for its American premiere on Sept. 22 at the New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall. This tale of love, betrayal, and envy lost its place in common operatic repertoire in the early 1900s, only to be revived by the toils of the Odyssey Opera’s music director, Gil Rose. After traveling to countless libraries across the US and Europe to conduct research and rummage through old scores, Rose resurrected the lively work which features a grandiose 70-piece orchestra, a 60-piece chorus, and eight Boston-based singers. Though it lacked a traditional set and direction, this opera captured both the strength and vulnerability that is central to the themes of the work.
This opera follows the heartbreaking drama of a scandalous love triangle between King Solomon (Kevin Thompson), Queen Balkis of Sheba (Kara Shay Thomson), and an architect called Adoniram (Dominick Chenes). Though the Queen is betrothed to Solomon, Adoniram quickly falls for her. At the same time, the story focuses on three of Adoniram’s workers: Amrou (Matthew DiBatistta), Phanor (David Kravitz), and Methousael (David Salsbury Fry), who are full of scorn after being denied higher wages. They seek to sabotage the casting of one of Adoniram’s latest bronze works. Things only get more complicated when Balkis begins to fall for Adoniram and becomes caught between her feelings for him and her duty to Solomon.
The plot is a complex mixture of romance and violence that is perfectly encapsulated by the music. There is a stark contrast between the subdued background of the third act and the tempestuous chromatic swells of the fifth act. At times, the music pivots entirely, becoming soft and emotional like when Solomon uses a pained vibrato to curse Balkis for leaving him.
The show’s set is very minimalistic, with Jordan Hall largely left alone. Lining the back of the stage is the chorus, a massive contingent that not only adds depth to the music, but whose presence, especially when they all stand up at once, adds a sense of visual grandeur.
Because the performance is staged like a concert, the show lacks the traditional layer of dynamism afforded by opera’s acting, props, set design, etc. This does not limit the performance — in fact, its simplicity only serves to accentuate the passion and skill of the performers. Kevin Thompson’s bass solos are sonorous and powerful, uplifted by the orchestra’s accompaniment, but still able to stand on their own a capella. Chenes’s tenor serves as a wonderful contrast — just as beautiful but embodying a different, more emotional and impulsive tone.
Kara Shay Thomson is the obvious star of the show. When she first appears onstage, dressed in stark magenta amid a sea of muted costumes, she shines. She is able to express the most peaceful contentedness when singing with her servants in the woods. This piece is pure, unbridled happiness, accentuated by a playful English horn and clarinet duet reminiscent of Edvard Grieg’s iconic “Morning Mood.” She can also be antagonizing, a match for King Solomon’s impassioned fervor. She manages to invoke a sense of primal sadness in response to Adoniram’s death with a raw cry that leaves the viewer with a deep remorse and an overwhelming urge to applaud.
Against 19th century conventions, the female character Balkis is the true heroine of this story. The story hinges on her bravery and her ability to break arbitrary social convention to attain her own happiness. Despite this superhuman bravery and passion, she remains grounded and humble. In spite of her little-known existence, the Queen of Sheba should join the ranks of famous female icons like Helen of Troy and Wonder Woman — the figure we need in today’s contemporary feminist society.

ABC’s latest drama “A Million Little Things” delivered an unimpressive debut, struggling to hit its tonal stride and tripping up over the “little things” that are supposed to come together for a compelling television experience. The episode presents decent performances and sets up several storylines and themes for the season to explore, but a number of writing and producing choices reflect that the show has not yet found its voice.
The show centers around a group of four friends whose lives are shaken when one of them, Jon (Ron Livingston), commits suicide and leaves everyone else to piece together what happened and how to move forward. His death prompts the others to confront the complacency and brokenness in their own lives and relationships, with his passing serving as a catalyst for change. Ed (David Giuntoli) struggles to leave a loveless marriage while having an affair with Delilah (Stephanie Szostak), Jon’s wife. Rome (Romany Malco) battles his own intense depression and suicidal ideation without telling his wife Regina (Christina Moses). And Gary (James Roday) lives in constant fear of his breast cancer returning. Nothing about the show is particularly innovative, and it hardly aims to be. Instead, it proposes all the makings of a heartfelt drama with a conversation about mental health at its core.
However, awkward tonal shifts and forced comedy confuse the delivery. No one knows why Jon killed himself, but instead of setting up an opportunity for his friends and family to explore a realistic and complex new understanding of him, the show presents a mystery involving his secretary, Ashley (Christina Ochoa), who hides his suicide note and deletes his files. The scenes regarding this mystery are paired with tense and suspenseful music, and each reveal adds more suspicion to the plot than the last, so it almost feels like clips from a crime show were edited into a melodrama.
The humor also tends to miss the mark. Network TV is no stranger to dramedies, but in an episode centered around two suicide attempts, a funeral, and protagonists that just lost one of their closest friends, jokes come across as being at best unnecessary and at worst uncomfortable. For instance, right after Ed says he almost expects Jon to “come walking through those doors” in his eulogy, Gary bursts in, late and with a date at his side. Later, when Ed, Gary, and Rome begin to reach a breakthrough in their long-stagnant friendship at a Bruins game, a bystander interjects by asking to cut them in line for beer. Rather than providing real comic relief, the execution ends up dampening tension that is entirely appropriate in the context and ultimately either feels unrealistic or develops disdain in the viewer for certain characters.
To make matters worse, multiple details do not feel like they fit in a 2018 show trying to encourage “progressive” conversations. The show features a man with breast cancer and a stay at home dad, yet these two men are also constantly made fun of by their closest friends for lacking “nips” and failing to “wear the pants in the family” respectively. While there are depictions of women supporting women, the first episode still barely passes the Bechdel test, and all the female characters are involved in the capacity of love interests aside from Ashley, the secretary. Furthermore, Ed’s wife, Katherine (Grace Park), is a career-driven woman portrayed as frigid and unfeeling as if to justify her husband’s affair.
This is not to say that there are no redeeming elements in the first episode, or even that it is wholly unenjoyable. The premiere does a good job of subverting expectations and maintaining threads of uncertainty throughout. It also succeeds in hitting key emotional beats when Gary reveals that his distress comes not from a relapse of cancer but rather from the prospect of spending the rest of his life in fear of it, and when Delilah breaks down for the first time only when she is finally alone. Yet these moments cannot carry a show on their own. Overall, much like the state of the protagonists in this premiere, “A Million Little Things” has the potential for growth but a long way to go.

I’ll come right out and say it: Battle royale games —  a genre comprising large-scale, survival-focused free-for-alls — are boring. I get it. Fortnite is huge. PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is huge. Major franchises like Call of Duty and Battlefield are joining the mix. Yet all of these games are stale, lack compelling worlds and storylines, and often approach mimicry. These games use the same point-and-shoot formula, mapped to slightly different environments. With the exception of Fortnite, which has a building mechanic in addition to the following characteristics, the other titles mentioned have vastly the same formula: high player-count, last player standing wins, and random force of impending doom closing in at timed intervals. They’re copy and paste hype-machines designed to milk players of their money over time. Do they do this with gameplay content? Typically, no. They sell cosmetic character upgrades — and lots of them. Fortnite, for example, opts to sell skins but provides free “content” updates. These new pieces of content come frequently. So frequently, in fact, they often cause bugs, instability, and complete imbalance in the game’s tuning. This includes new weapons, items, and map areas. The items are gimmicky. The weapons seem untested. Map areas mean very little to actual gameplay. For any traditional game, developers consistently pushing buggy content would be frowned upon. For these battle royale games, though, it is overlooked because players are not directly paying for them. Not only is it not a good development practice, it degrades the quality of the game.
BR games combine some of the best aspects of multiplayer gameplay with the worst parts of storytelling technique and lore. The majority of these games have no story to tell the player. They exist in an echochamber where several dozen people parachuting onto an island only to kill each other makes sense. Rarely do they make attempts to contextualize the mode or the game world at all. In Fortnite’s case, they use the mysterious, sparsely placed lore to their advantage by selling new cosmetics with every new, discontinuous, themed season (seriously, a coherent story is nowhere to be found). Of course, it can be fun to squad up and play with some friends in such an open environment. This is what makes most co-op and multiplayer games fun, but it is not what gives them longevity. For that, players need something to invest in. BR games currently have players investing in a virtual closet, and I’m not sure that’s enough to keep them happy and engaged long term. With that in mind, let’s look at some of the core BR game mechanics to understand why longevity could be an issue.
The repetition of dropping in and looting becomes extremely boring over time. Not only does the random placement of the loot frustrate me, but doing the same thing over and over again at the beginning of matches drives me insane. One spends a good few minutes waiting, spawning in, choosing a location, and looting before even thinking about engaging one’s first enemy. The randomness of other players also means one can play an entire 20-plus minute match without seeing an enemy until the final zone. If you do all of this and still take the loss — with no eliminations — it can be an extremely unsatisfying, worthless gameplay experience. Worse yet, the all-or-nothing stakes promotes strategies where some players simply hide until the end of the match. This is a problem, in part, because average players can walk away from an hour-long gaming session feeling like they accomplished nothing.Those same people will be more likely to watch someone skilled play the game on Twitch, YouTube, or Mixer (e.g. Ninja) than continue to play the game themselves. Sure, battle royale is growing now, but what happens when the majority of your player base becomes bored? Large game publishing companies know user attrition all too well. Look at the Call of Duty franchise, for example. Unit sales have been steadily declining for Call of Duty since its heyday in 2011, and Activision, its publisher, has had little success returning the franchise to its former glory.
I’m afraid the same type of user attrition is on the way for BR games, and it may happen sooner than we all think. Without creative new additions to the genre, battle royale will cease to hold the attention of next-generation gamers. The end of the honeymoon phase is fast approaching, and the future of battle royale as a genre relies on the next wave of releases to carry it forward. If the big publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision fail to deliver meaningful, unique experiences this fall, it could very well send BR to an early grave.

The second season of “American Vandal” ends with the proclamation that, in an era defined by digital appearance, “We’re all full of shit.” The show takes that statement literally, as the Netflix Original  mockumentary centers on the case of the “Turd Burglar,” a mysterious villain who commits a series of feces-based crimes. Student investigators Peter Maldonado (Tyler Alvarez) and Sam Ecklund (Griffin Gluck) take on their second case, which takes place in the prestigious St. Bernardine School, a high school in Bellevue, Washington.
The first season of “Vandal” was a thinly-veiled satire of the true crime format, with Peter and Sam trying to discern which one of their classmates spray-painted a number of penises on the faculty’s cars in the school parking lot. While the second season maintains the absurd satire of its predecessor, it surpasses it in its themes, namely in its evaluation of class, justice, and social media and the roles they play in high school life. Still, “American Vandal” manages to look at these themes in an incredibly funny way. In fact, the show’s strongest moments are when it steps back from the plot and lets its viewers contemplate what’s actually happening in the story.
In the seventh episode of the season, “Shit Storm,” Peter and Sam find themselves in a tense interview with a local convenience store owner. While the belligerent owner evades their questions, Sam puts on a hat and poses for the camera. The moment draws attention towards the absurdity of the situation. It makes the viewer remember that these seemingly serious investigators are just kids who heard about the existence of someone who goes by “The Turd Burglar.” While they and everyone around them regards the case as a purely serious matter, the moment hints at the ridiculousness of the situation that Peter and Sam are in. These somewhat subtle yet frequent abstractions from the plot characterize the show’s comedic style: The show immerses its viewers in a frivolous plot before hilariously pulling them out of it.
Beyond its jokes, “American Vandal” tries to critique modern culture. Some of these analyses, particularly socioeconomic class, shine through quite clearly. Basketball star DeMarcus Tillman (Melvin Gregg) holds two nuanced roles in the St. Bernardine community: He’s both a campus celebrity and a student who comes from a far less affluent background than most of St. Bernardine. While DeMarcus is probably the funniest character in “American Vandal,” his progression as a character throughout the season is the show at its most thoughtful.
The second episode of the season, simply called “#2,” also makes a clear statement about the flaws in the American criminal justice system. In the episode, Peter and Sam analyze a police interview of a Kevin McClain (Travis Tope), a Turd Burglar suspect whose confession does not seem quite right. The episode begins by presenting statistics on the surprisingly large number (25% of the 1,532 overturned homicide convictions between 1989 and 2015) of wrongly convicted murderers who previously confessed to their crimes. The episode goes on to take a strong stance against police coercion, showing how Kevin crumbled when put under pressure.
Although “American Vandal” does succeed in some of its commentaries, the fact that it brings up slightly different themes in each episode leaves the show struggling to solidify some of those ideas. In particular, the show’s take on social media, which features prominently in the final moments of the season, feels somewhat disconnected from the rest of the show. While social media does play a significant role in the plot of “American Vandal,” the show jumps between themes so much throughout the season that it feels relatively unsupported. The first season of “American Vandal” lacked the poignance of the second season, yet it seems that the second season sometimes tries too hard to be poignant, feeling discontinuous instead.
Still, “American Vandal” first and foremost sets out to be a comedy. In this regard, it is extremely successful. The show is amusing and contains a well-thought-out plot that draws viewers in before making clear how absurd its situations are. This element of the show gives rise to some of its funniest moments. Moreover, “American Vandal” often succeeds in pointing out certain themes of class, criminal justice, and social media, though, with the latter in particular, these themes occasionally feel less fleshed out than they could have been. Nevertheless, the second season of “American Vandal” will leave its viewers thinking, “Shit, that’s funny.”

“Here’s what every woman knows,” new NBC sitcom “I Feel Bad” begins. “We feel bad about something almost every day. Like sometimes, I cheat on my husband in my sleep.”
The line is spoken by the show’s lead, Emet Kamala-Sweetzer (Sarayu Blue), over a tropical island dream sequence. It’s a moderately funny line, if a little predictable. TV audiences have likely seen stressed moms joking about work before. But “moderately funny and a little predictable” usually applies to sitcom pilots more generally. What’s interesting isn’t whether “I Feel Bad” is good — it isn’t — but whether it has potential. And through the combined powers of Blue and a team of executive producers that includes Amy Poehler, “I Feel Bad” has buckets of potential.
The show, which airs next on Oct. 4, is centered around Emet’s adventures as a wife, daughter, mother, and video-game-company artist. “I Feel Bad” is equal parts a workplace and family sitcom. The show tries for overall political relevance in both spheres, but its message is sharper at Emet’s job: She is the only woman in her male-dominated tech workplace. Her main coworkers are three obnoxious-but-mostly-loveable younger men, all of whom need Emet to protect and mother them.
In the first two episodes, not much happens beyond the establishment of these facts. In Episode One, Emet tries to discipline her daughter Lily (Lily Rose Silver) without turning into her own punitive mother (Madhur Jaffrey). In Episode Two, Emet housesits for her wealthy neighbors and gets carried away with the freedom of being alone in a nice house. In both, Emet is the star and central character — the plot rarely turns away from her, and everyone else is developed only when they impact on the lead.
The centrality of the protagonist is easily the best decision that the show producers could have made. Sarayu Blue sparkles as Emet. She’s funny without being raunchy, tough without being abrasive, and endlessly charismatic and relatable. In fact, one of the jokes that didn’t land revolved around Blue’s hypothetical unattractiveness: Like in “30 Rock,” which relentlessly referenced Liz Lemon (Tina Fey)’s “ugliness,” it’s simply not plausible. Despite Emet’s very believable anxieties, she’s still a beautiful person living a sitcom-clean lifestyle.
Accordingly, much of “I Feel Bad”’s unrealized potential lies in its lack of grubbiness. “30 Rock,” “The Office,” “black-ish,” and even “Parks and Recreation” gained a certain edginess throughout their tenures. “I Feel Bad” has elements of all of its predecessors: a workplace setup straight from “30 Rock,” a family dynamic from “black-ish,” and an overall sweetness that is pure Amy Poehler. In the first two episodes, “I Feel Bad” doesn’t live up to any of these antecedents. But in their first few episodes, neither did they. “I Feel Bad” has a glowing cast, a reliably funny concept, and a solid pop culture relevancy — and for now, that’s reason enough to keep watching.

What seems like a typical coming-of-age novel about a high school teen struggling to fit in transforms into a complicated story filled with teenage rebellion, familial conflicts, and Singaporean culture. “Ponti,” a novel written by Sharlene Teo, follows three Singaporean women, Szu, Circe, and Amisa, who struggle in a cutthroat environment that heightens their insecurities.. Szu is Amisa’s only daughter, and a major disappointment in Amisa’s eyes. Whereas Amisa is a stunningly beautiful, retired actress who enchants almost every man with just her looks, Szu is the typical coming-of-age character: unattractive, overweight, and unliked by her peers. She has only one friend, Circe, another misfit who plays an important role in Szu’s dark childhood. The story, while including unique turns that reveal that these characters are not one-dimensional, remains mundane and like many other young adult novels. The story has an unoriginal plot about the life of three different women prevalent in many young adult novels, but the plot reveals that these characters are not as one-dimensional as they seem and struggle through their own internal conflicts.
The novel starts as young adult novels often do: A young teenage girl who finds herself, yet again, in a position of shame in a social setting. Immediately, Teo introduces themes of insecurity and constant comparison between the main character and those that surround her. She desperately wishes to be like other girls, with boyfriends who go on group dates to the movies. “Ponti” brings up rather superficial topics of beauty and wealth through the contrasts between characters. Much of the book talks about how Amisa and Szu have been treated based on their looks. On one hand, Amisa is offered a role in a movie while working in a movie theater and on the other hand, Szu is rejected by her mom because of her weight. However, as the novel continues, it’s clear that there is more to these relationships than pettiness or simple rivalries. The underlying tensions can be characterized with layers of trouble that have been brewing for a long time, something that keeps the novel interesting and new.
Teo’s decision to simultaneously switch from first person to third person, between characters as well as between time periods, creates a holistic understanding of the characters. Amisa isn’t just the critical mother nor is Circe Szu’s supporting sidekick. The shift between past and present could be confusing but instead, Teo finds a way to utilize cliffhangers and plot reveals to keep the reader interested. The way the reader is forced to piece all of these memories mirrors Circe’s and Szu’s respective points of view as they themselves try to remember everything from their past. This adds to the suspense, making it more enjoyable, and allows the readers to get attached to the story.
The most refreshing aspect of this novel is how Teo writes about her depiction of a Southeastern Asian experience which veers far from the stereotypes seen in many other novels. Teo, who was born in Singapore, writes about the everyday lives of women in Singapore, a daily life that is extremely relevant to teenage girls, despite its cultural specificity. How Szu and Circe “take the train to Bugis, but the movie [they] want to see is sold out so [they] buy giant cups of Diet Coke and sit by the giant pillars in the cinema lobby because this is habit,” seems to mirror a simplistic and relatable life. On the other hand, Teo also cleverly mentions Bugis, an area that was once known for its large shopping complex, restaurants and nightlife, but is now a popular spot for Singaporeans rather than tourists. As they experience their ups and downs, the continuation of these routines seems almost necessary and their interactions are genuine in their own way. So, while Teo does not bombard the novel with Singaporean specialties and it is easy to forget that this takes place in the Eastern Asian country, it is realistic in the way that everyone’s life can be generalized: Not every culture is specific to their most commonly known customs.
“Ponti” can be both a quick read and a thought-provoker. There is both a lightheartedness and a sincerity that seems to make the novel a page turner and rather easy to read. “Ponti” may seem slow, generic, or typical at first glance, but the secrets that are uncovered about why Amisa is so cold-hearted and distant, and how these untied ends are resolved, are far more engaging than other coming-of-age novels.

In the era of film and television dominated by grayscale dramas, sappy romance, 15 seasons of “Grey’s Anatomy,” and old-school remakes, it is not surprising to hear that the show made famous by a lush mustache and a red Ferrari 308 GTSi QV has emerged once again on CBS. In its heyday in the ’80s, Tom Selleck played the lead man, Thomas Magnum, in the hit show “Magnum, P.I,” which follows a private eye scouring the Hawaiian island of Oahu, exemplifying the best of TV in its runtime. Throughout this time in American television history, networks were booming and the United States had reached the pinnacle of prime time TV. Alongside “Magnum P.I.,” there were greats such as “Cheers,” “Alf,” “SMASH,” and the “A-Team.” However, much of NBC, CBS, and ABC today is markedly less memorable and less entertaining, the “Magnum P.I.” remake included.
The episode, which premiered on Sept. 24 opens with Magnum (Jay Hernandez), Rick (Zachary Knighton), CT (Stephen Hill), and Nuzo (Reznor Allen) sitting around the lavish Robin Masters estate and reading one of the stories the New York Times bestselling author had based on the four friends. In the story, Magnum’s character parachutes into enemy territory to help a doctor and his family escape the oppressive tyranny of a malevolent dictator while the other three help in a helicopter. This exciting, action-packed hook seems to be an intriguing building block to take the rest of the episode in a new direction. However, very quickly the episode begins to mirror that of its ’80s counterpart. The same characters, old red Ferrari, beautiful Hawaiian location, and duplicate plotline quickly overshadow the burst of excitement and originality that emerged in the first four minutes. The feigned imaginative ideas were not indicative of the show. Thomas Magnum, just as he did in the ’80s, would quarrel with the police, bargain with the Navy, and go on the same journey. The only difference is that it’s taped on digital HD instead of film.
As is the case in many of today’s remakes — like “Hawaii Five-O,” “Macgyver,” “Miami Vice,” and many more — the shows are revived for obvious reasons: loyal and excited fan bases, rich character arcs, and the relation to a current day idyllic life. In the past, Tom Selleck played a man people wished to be. He lived on a beautiful island, drove a foreign sports car, spent time with lovely women, and fought crime in the best way he could. Much of this same flair and bravado was translated into the show we see today. However, 1980 and 2018 are very different times. No longer are there shows made specifically for men — “Magnum P.I.,” “The Dukes of Hazzard,” “Knight Rider” — and specifically for women — “I Love Lucy,” “Little House on the Prairie,” “The Golden Girls.” There were obviously stereotypically “male” moments of the show throughout the whole 42 minute runtime, much of it action sequences of the type enjoyed by the first iteration’s audience. Sadly, the focus of the remake is on special effects and copying past themes, rather than the personalities and sweeping character arcs that marked the original show. The explosions look better today but the conversations are dry, plain and simple.
Following the conclusion of the pilot, with its nods to the past and attempts to modernize the joy that used to be felt watching the reruns of Higgins, TC, Rick, and Magnum roving the islands of the Pacific in attempts to help friends and strangers alike was mostly lost. With the next episode airing on Oct. 1, there is hope for improvement. In many critically and publicly acclaimed shows, “The Office,” “Parks and Recreation,” “The Big Bang Theory,” and “How I Met Your Mother,” the first episodes were tense and lacked the personality and finesse that eventually evolved and caught the audience’s attention. Looking to the future, there is a hopeful possibility that this “Magnum, P.I.” remake can shake the typical pitfalls of shows of its type and earn a spot in the hearts of many in new, exciting ways just like Tom Selleck and his crew did back in the good old days.

Fans of Hank Green packed into Boston’s Wilbur Theater this past Wednesday to see him introduce his recently debuted novel, “An Absolutely Remarkable Thing,” along with viral videos featuring kittens and a Hermione Granger cosplayer breakdancing in feverish fashion. “Human nature expanded itself into a space it was not built to exist for, and its culture did not have structures to support. But we learned a great many things, things about ourselves, things about people who are different from us, things about giraffe sex,” Green said. Throughout his presentation, coordinated by local bookstore Brookline Booksmith, Green celebrated the wackiness of cyberspace and underscored the insoluble tension between the destructive and promising consequences that technological innovation entails.
Green and his brother John, the author of beloved young adult novels “The Fault in Our Stars” and “Looking for Alaska,” comprise the popular Youtube channel “Vlogbrothers,” and recently, “Dear Hank & John,” which they call “a comedy podcast about death.” Hank Green, who has dabbled in numerous web projects and invented glasses that render 3D movies in 2D, fittingly discussed the trappings of fame and the trend of public figures creating recognizable brands or personas, and whether there is something to be said for beholding a work apart from its creator.
“That sounds a little like a Vlogbrothers script,” he said of his philosophizing, to laughter from a familiar audience. “In these times, I sometimes feel like I should read all the books by the people I know, that I interact with on Twitter, but I also really want to spend time consuming content in a different way where I don’t see the author as a lens or as a part of the work.”
“We’ve been watching them ever since eighth grade...and we just kind of grew up with them,” Erin E. Hattamer, a student at Emerson College and audience member, said. “I love the meaning they put behind it, how they really care...I’ve never seen them in real life, and it’d just be so weird because I’ve seen them through this little camera my whole entire life, and now I’m going to see them as 3D people.”
Green’s novel centers on the sudden and inexplicable appearance of Carls, Transformer-esque, samurai-like robotic beings, and the young characters who must grapple with the complications of newfound stardom after they make a viral video about the Carls. Green returned to the stage in a bumblebee costume (recalling the Transformer hero Bumblebee), as the fictional Professor Alfred Bumbley, Professor of the History of Robotics at Boston College. He then narrated a slideshow on everything from the etymology of “robot” to primitive humanoid robots, Hollywood robots, and the robots taking over manufacturing jobs, while making sure to lampoon his own authority. “I’m just your average middle-aged bumblebee professor who can transform into a Kia Sorento,” he said.
Concerns about the increasingly accessible and mechanized world undergirded Green’s presentation. Embedded in his lighthearted jokes and tangents was a warning and a prompt to reflect on the otherworldly creatures in his own novel. “Robots have solved and will continue to solve so many human problems. Except for all the ones that they cause. Ultimately, our ideas about robots are not about robots. The robot is a canvas onto which we project our hopes and our dreams and our fears...they become embodiments of those hopes and dreams and fears. That’s especially true since the Carls have arrived. What you see when you look at the Carls says so much more about you than it says about them. The Carls remind us that just as reality, of course, shapes our beliefs, our beliefs also shape our reality. And so we have to be careful what we believe and what we value. Because we will pass it all on to the humans who will come after us,” he said.
Green also delighted fans with personal ramblings. He explained his baby obsession after noticing a 13 month-old baby in the audience and demonstrated his fondness for popular music. “Hit me Daddy Yankee,” he said, later picking up his own guitar and singing a cover of Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” as well as an original song about humorous Harry Potter fan theories. Then he invited John onstage for a live “Dear Hank & John” podcast, during which they discussed Wimbledon, politics, parenting tips, and the idleness of the Mars Curiosity rover. They allayed an audience member’s shame over deferring her bachelor’s degree, and tried their best to answer the question, “When and where would be the worst place to release a quail?”
“I’ve always said that [Hank and John are within] the top five people I want to meet in my lifetime,” said Tia F. Moores, a student at Emmanuel College. “They’re like the top three, I’m not gonna lie...they’re the top two, but I can’t pick who I’d want to meet over the other because I love both of them equally.”

In 2001, I was two years old, and while I’m sure someone probably stuck me in front of the TV, I didn’t keep up with the film scene very well. If you’d asked me which movie I wanted to win Best Picture, I probably would have drooled. Amateur.
Apparently, however, my toddler self was missing out: One Google search later and I’ve found out that 2001 was The Year for movies. It spawned franchises, fangirls, and quotes that are still ingrained in our collective heads 17 years later. For the sake of length, this list excludes films as significant as “Moulin Rouge!,” “Pearl Harbor,” “Spirited Away,” and “Zoolander” — and despite my best editing, it’s still too long. You’ll see pretty soon, though, that I couldn’t leave any other titles out. So here it is, y’all. Here are the best movies of 2001.
1. “Shrek”
Released in May of 2001, “Shrek” was (rightfully) the first ever winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It was also entered, maybe less rightfully, into the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. In his review of the film, New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell wrote, “Beating up on the irritatingly dainty Disney trademarks is nothing new; it's just that it has rarely been done with the demolition-derby zest of ‘Shrek.’” It’s not so much that Shrek is a spectacular movie, per se, as it is that some of its gimmicks (constant pop culture references, irreverent entendres) would become mainstays of 21st Century animated features. And of course, there’s the endless stream of video games that the franchise produced. In conclusion: I don’t know who thought this movie was a good idea, but we owe them a great service.
2. “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring”
I have yet to stay awake through any Lord of the Rings movie. If you’re not like me, however, the franchise’s first release was significant: “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” was the second-highest grossing film of the year. It also stars the wonderful Ian McKellen, an important selling point. Apparently, the scene where McKellen, who plays Gandalf, bumps into a beam in Bilbo’s hobbit-hole was an accident — further proof that Ian McKellen is the single best thing to happen to this trilogy.
3. “Ocean’s Eleven”
Yet another ridiculously long franchise! “Ocean’s Eleven” is relevant once again because of this summer’s female reboot, “Ocean’s 8.” The original (or, the 2001 remake of the 1960 original) follows Danny Ocean and his 11 accomplices as they try to rob three Las Vegas casinos in a single night. Even by 2018 standards, the cast is insane: It includes George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Julia Roberts. Besides the whole casino-robbing thing, these protagonists don’t do a lot. But if you want a low-stress heist movie, “Ocean’s Eleven” holds up.
4. “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone”
The book version of the first Harry Potter installment hit shelves almost exactly 20 years ago, on September 1, 1998. Two decades (and my entire lifetime) later, both book and movie remain impressively relevant. While of course the books are better, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” gets a lot of credit for a.) being the highest grossing film in 2001, and b.) featuring 11-year-old Emma Watson. There are many painfully sweet, nostalgic anecdotes about the making of this movie — my personal favorite is that the granddaughter Richard Harris (who plays Dumbledore) said she would never speak to him again if he didn’t take the part.
5. “Legally Blonde”
Clearly, I saved the best for last. “Legally Blonde,” starring Reese Witherspoon as Elle Woods, is iconic. There’s a reason that Harvard screens the movie on the Widener steps every fall — and it’s the same reason you should rewatch it again right now. The movie gained a sequel in 2003 and a Broadway musical in 2007, but the original remains both the funniest and the most quotable. (“What, like it’s hard?”)
Of course, the movies listed above are not comprehensive. The runners up include “Monsters, Inc.,” “The Princess Diaries,” and “The Fast and the Furious” (all worthy contenders). Still, every one of the listed titles prove my point: 2001 was a miniature golden age in American film. The year’s output has serious staying power. I hope all of y’all have seen every movie on this list — and if you haven’t, then at least you have a wonderful plan for this weekend. Enjoy!

While growing up, “Little Women” (1868) was — coincidentally, given its intense religiosity — a kind of Bible for me. It provided assurance and stability that I found almost nowhere else. Its characters were constantly in the pursuit of improvement and personal success that even at the age of 11, I could not help but admire them. Not only did I want to emulate them, I wanted to be them.
It was this constant push towards progress that made the March girls the ideal role models. They became pillars of courage and kindness that I strived to mimic with a comical, childish omnipotence. With much effort, I attempted to adopt Jo’s defiance, Beth’s kindness, and Meg’s responsibility. I’m sorry to say that I never truly liked Amy and never will, so I never strived to adopt any of her qualities other than her artistry. It was my hope that armed with these traits, I too could join the perfect March family.
While Louisa May Alcott’s book still remains a childhood classic and a favorite, it is not difficult to return to it with a much more critical eye. This bildungsroman follows the four March sisters, who grow up in Concord, Mass., during the 1860s. Over the course of the work, the sisters work hard, fall in love, experience heartbreak, and eventually leave home. Though the story abounds in familial love and romance, the dark shadow of tragedy is never too far behind. While it is often sold as a heartwarming tale of sisterhood and virtue, a careful rereading reveals an almost overzealous religiosity, a sobering account of illness and early death as well as a dangerous argument in favor of acquiescence.
The sisters’ childhoods are steeped in reading religious texts like John Bunyan’s “The Pilgrim’s Progress,” which is a bit startling considering their young age and the challenging nature of these works. In many respects, their spirituality is a positive influence on their lives, guiding them through deeply emotional times of war and various family members’ illnesses. This text is also where the family draws most of its values, particularly piety and familial duty. Having said this, it is a bit dismal to find that, with all their good qualities, the women of the novel are relegated to the task of gatekeeping morality.
For all of its progressive beliefs, “Little Women” can often be backwards, particularly in its depiction of women’s roles. The most demure of the characters, Beth, is particularly emblematic of the link between pristine virtue and femininity and the home. The problem with this is that Alcott doesn’t provide any counterexamples to show the different opportunities that women could be afforded. Even writer and rebel Jo, who isn’t supposed to succumb to the pressures of societal expectations, gives up her work in favor of marriage and children. Though Louisa May Alcott was herself a famous “spinster”— an older, unmarried woman — and based Jo largely on herself, she does not allow her own lifestyle any voice.
It has become increasingly well documented that Alcott, who published the work in two parts and based it on her own childhood with her sisters in Massachusetts, thought her own novel to be “moral pap.” Her previous writing was worlds away from pickled limes and “The Pilgrim’s Progress” — it features lurid tales of sexual encounters, vicious murders, and drug use. Yet “Little Women” was so successful that it rendered Alcott financially independent, capable of living life the way she had always wanted. The poverty and struggle the March family experience is a romanticized version of the starvation and cold that Alcott herself faced and resented. “I’ll be rich and famous and happy before I die, see if I won’t,” she once said. It is hard to imagine even spirited protagonist Jo saying these words.
Criticism aside, “Little Women” should not be admonished for long. Though it is vital to delve into its darker themes and complex, sometimes contradictory messages, the book has many forward thinking instances. It has always promoted a strong bond between women that almost serves as a kind of proto-feminism. Jo’s flagrant disdain for social convention in choice of career, and even to a certain extent of her husband, is representative of this too. Her spirit has always struck a particular chord with female readers, making her a strong favorite. Though its other characters are just as loveable, it is almost a blatant mistake to read the book for anyone but Jo.
The March sisters also have combined desire for knowledge and travel of the world that is infectious, inspiring the same spirit in countless readers beside myself. Their empathy and care for one another are still admired and will continue to be. Alcott’s hilarious and detailed accounts of mishaps like the burning of Meg’s hair before the ball, Beth’s and Jo’s trip to the coast, and the Amy’s pickled lime incident will never cease to delight even upon multiple re-readings.
As mentioned before, “Little Women” has borne the brunt of increasing criticism for some of its outdated thinking. Important though as it is to acknowledge its faults, it is equally as important to celebrate its triumphs. 150 years after it was written by Alcott in her home Orchard House, “Little Women” remains a source of inspiration providing girls with role models and charmingly encapsulating the anguish and joy of growing up.

BROCKHAMPTON is a boy band of contradictions. Among the most explosive underground acts of the last few years, the group’s 12-odd members make hip hop music that’s uncomfortably blunt, evasive, fiery, and intimate. So in a world of increasingly popular indie rap music and playlists — in which emotional rap artists churning out shadowy R&B fusions are rewarded — BROCKHAMPTON’s popularity is all the more confusing. The group commands festivals where college kids scream, “I just want a friend that I can hang out with,” and then mosh over lyrics about Heath Ledger and oral sex. They don’t rap over trap beats, but they’re no Pro Era. Their music can be gratuitously violent and occasionally naive, but they’re no Odd Future. Their collective identity is hard to pin down — partly because it works greatly to their music’s benefit, and partly because they refuse to stick to one.
Even the band’s artistic growth is contradictory. While active since 2015, the group made their name releasing three top-notch albums within the last half of 2017, fittingly titled “SATURATION I,” “II,” and “III” — the first of which was a refreshing and surprisingly emotionally versatile fusion of hip hop, pop, R&B, and even emo elements. On “SATURATION II,” the group somehow got more polished while laying down more aggressive verses over plucked strings and whimsical horns, while on the trilogy’s concluding album, the brightest, poppiest tracks in the group’s discography stood toe to toe with their freakiest sonic experiments yet.
So of course, on “iridescence,” their first major project released after nine turbulent months—which included the departure of tentpole member and rapper Ameer Vann following allegations of sexual assault—BROCKHAMPTON takes their old sound and, in all senses of the word, oversaturates it. The bass is squelching and distorted. The synths are tinny and textured. The flows are more rhythmic than ever — even the album art is a disturbingly blown out negative. And yet the emotion on this BROCKHAMPTON pours out unlike any of their other albums, because, for the first time, the group sacrifices all of their subtlety for overwhelming sincerity. Strings soar and choirs holler. Rappers belt out hooks and the group’s resident singer tells us he’s got his weapon tucked. It’s a whole new world for moody teenager music.
The album’s opening two tracks, which may as well be one given their identical hooks and drums, are a thesis statement of sorts. “NEW ORLEANS,” kicking off the album with bombastic if tedious bass synths and floating ghost choir samples, is the yin to “THUG LIFE”’s yang, with its rich, understated pianos. Rapper Dom McLennon (the group’s best bar-for-bar rapper) drops verses equally confrontational and somber on the respective tracks, speaking to the isolation, paranoia, and euphoria of newfound fame. In doing so, the group brazenly shows their hand — applying their template of contradiction to an updated sound, punctuated by the growing pains of the last year and the momentum of their burgeoning success.
“SOMETHING ABOUT HIM” is where the album truly breaks new ground. A tender and vocoder-ed Kevin Abstract is enamored with his boyfriend among shy synths and muffled percussion — speaking far more in the emotional language of something like Björk’s “Vespertine” than anything the group had approached in the SATURATION trilogy. The track might not feature what one would call a structurally sound song, but it displays a vulnerability that’s refreshing even for BROCKHAMPTON.
This vulnerability makes its most masterful appearance on “WEIGHT,” one of the best examples in their entire catalogue of the group’s various sounds and moods coalescing into something truly stunning. The track first gives us what every BROCKHAMPTON album wouldn’t be complete without — a showstopping Kevin verse reminiscing about youth and the pains of sexual awakening. This time, however, the group is unashamedly emotional — lacing his verse with lush, wistful strings and following it with a monumental chorus. The song develops beautifully phase after phase. It’s on tracks like “WEIGHT” where Ameer’s departure seems like an artistic blessing in disguise. The track is unabashedly pained and lonely — zero percent tough talk, zero percent unearned swagger. Verses by a surprisingly breakbeat and poetic Joba and Dom don’t feel an inch out of place. Joba whimpers the conclusion of the song-ending, snappy refrain. It’s an airtight moment on an album that’s purposefully, though not always satisfyingly, messy with ideas.
This messiness shows up most glaringly when the group, instead of distributing their cornucopia of musical and thematic ideas across the album evenly, overcompensate dazzlingly to make up for tracks that are fundamentally lacking. “SAN MARCOS,” in which a meditative guitar loop and vaguely rueful verses from Matt, Kevin, and Dom only remind listeners how much better this idea was pulled off on “SUNNY” (off “SATURATION II”), is transformed when we’re inexplicably joined by the London Community Gospel Choir and a bar-rock groove to close the song. “FABRIC” is one of the oddest closers to ever appear on a BROCKHAMPTON album, with angry ruminations from Kevin over fuzzy synths transitioning to a Joba verse over plucked guitar, and ending with club-ready kicks, blaring sirens, and pillars of static. What helps is that BROCKHAMPTON seems to be completely aware of when a song is lacking in traditional, let’s-develop-this-song-logically ideas, and so their gratuitous virtuosity often shows up exactly when one is feeling disengaged. On “HONEY,” a so-so set of verses over a nocturnal (if slightly bland) synthpop instrumental is violently tossed overboard two minutes in. In comes a soaring, hair-metal guitar lead. Next a gospel choir with cathedral-reverb. And, of course, Beyoncé — yes, Beyoncé — vocal cuts. BROCKHAMPTON is daring listeners to tell them they’ve lost their minds. Even if they have, there’s enough fun happening to want to stay.

On the original SATURATION, Dom opens an iconic verse on “STAR” by tempting the audience: “I might go Interstellar / I feel like Matthew McConaughey.” On “iridescence,” BROCKHAMPTON take up that challenge. They go interstellar — revising proven formulas, exploring new sonic and lyrical identities, and, like the movie, accompany every stroke of brilliance with moments of meandering, excess, and trite emotion. With magnetic protagonists on a compelling journey, though, “iridescence” is fundamentally unafraid in its ambition to show just how hard it’s trying. Just like the album art, even at its most garish, it’s hard to turn away.

One of the top new young adult novels coming out this year, “A Winter’s Promise,” is the first book of a new series written by the renowned French author, Christine Dabos. Although the characters tend to be dull and uninteresting, the book still presents a fascinating magical setting filled with a complex plot full of political mystery.
“A Winter’s Promise” takes place in a world that has been fragmented into areas called “arcs,” each with their own mystical elements. Dabos’ creative strength quickly presents itself as she describes Anima, the native homeland of the  heroine Ophelia, in which “objects come to life” and “old buildings tend...to become appallingly bad-tempered.” Furthermore, many individuals in anima are gifted with supernatural abilities, such as Ophelia’s ability to travel through mirrors and “read” the history of tangible objects by simply “touching...without protective gloves,” while others are able to mend broken objects by touch as well. In this world, the people of every arc regard each other as part of the same family guided by an immortal, revered ancestor, and regularly posit early arranged marriages for the strengthening of alliances or family trees.
The setting of the book becomes even more complex as we learn that Ophelia, a young girl cursed with a clumsy tendency, is to be forced into an arranged marriage with an elusive, unknown man, Thorn, from the infamous arc of Pole known for its extreme weather and brash individuals. As the marriage approaches in the plot, Thorn’s inconsiderate, ill-behaved character appears as he both insults and downright ignores Ophelia and her family in their presence. Despite both Ophelia and her family taking offense to this behavior, the marriage goes on as the Doyenne, one of the most powerful leaders of Anima, threatens to exile Ophelia from the arc if the marriage fails.
Although the worldbuilding in the book is incredibly complex, it severely outshines the characters in the story. Ophelia’s presentation as an unsophisticated, plain girl whose lack of femininity is juxtaposed with the superficial description of the other girls in the story is uninteresting. While it is a break from the usual all-popular Queen Bees stereotype proliferated in so many teen fiction novels, in “A Winter’s Promise,” Ophelia’s characterization is in no way unique. Ophelia revels in the belief that because she is not like other girls, she is characteristically superior. This idea is proliferated in media time and time again, and Dabos' descriptions of Ophelia interacting with other girls serve to highlight the contrast between Ophelia’s disinterest in her physical appearance and the excessive amount of attention placed by other characters into theirs. The dialogue in these instances sound forced, with statements such as “Holy curler! Don’t tell me you’re still wearing this old pair of horrors!” The writing seems to ridicule the girls who place a lot of care in their appearance for the purpose of exalting Ophelia for her indifference.
The complete absence of any diversity detracts from the story, making the characters less relatable and thus less engaging. The book takes place in a fragmented world where “men and women...rallied to the family spirit to create a new society.” However, for a place created from the people of our world, there seems to be no represented identity other than that of white heterosexuality. This is especially troubling: Have people of color never existed in this fantasy, or did they just uniformly not survive the Rupture, the end of the past world? The cultural homogeneity may be a hard barrier to get past for readers who expect realistic depictions of identity.
“A Winter’s Promise” is worth the read for avid enthusiasts of fantasy series. While characters may be uninteresting and the dialogue comes off as cliché at times, it does present a nuanced plot that can please readers regardless of age. As a first installment of an upcoming series, it presents a solid introduction into a world in which the character development will, hopefully, subsequently shine as equitably as the setting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eyes glued to the morning cartoons, I was sprawled out on the living room floor with a bag of half-eaten Doritos in my arms.
“Tochukwu,” my grandmother called exasperatedly, walking into the room. “Didn’t you hear me calling?”
I murmured unintelligibly, hoping to exhaust her and be left alone in the parlour. Shaking her head, my grandmother snatched up the snack bag beside me before heading out of the room.
“Hey,” I protested, licking a cheesy finger clean.
“And turn that TV off please,” she said. “A lazy boy will one day be a lazy man.”
Grumbling, I reluctantly obeyed, heading upstairs to my comfortable bed to resume reading my earmarked copy of “Things Fall Apart” by Chinua Achebe for the first time.
Seven years later, I came across the novel again, now a much less daunting volume, and ate up its pages in two days. Of the various aspects for which Achebe’s magnum opus has been widely acclaimed, the role sloth plays in sculpting Achebe’s protagonist is what colored my second reading.
Growing up in the digital generation, I am no stranger to indolence, and would have been quite happy as a child to spend long hours on the computer or television had I been permitted to. To combat these tendencies, my grandmother fed my siblings and I a steady diet of stories composed of both gripping moral fables of the mischievous tortoise and his exploits as well as more biographical accounts of the struggles and triumphs of our ancestors. With electric sections of musical call and response along with a sobering adage or two to conclude each story, my grandmother managed to drum her Igbo values into us, those of honesty, compassion and industry.
In revisiting Achebe’s “Things Fall Apart,” the warring forces of indolence and industry  captivated me as I tried to understand the quiet fulfillment I felt at Okonkwo’s plow as he prepared the yam fields with the effortless joy of Unoka playing his opi to accompany the rooster’s crow in the early hours of the morning. In these characters, I see the the extremes of both virtue and vice, and the devastation it wrought on its inhabitants.
In “Things Fall Apart,” Okonkwo is shaped by his disgust of sloth, the vice that his own father happily embraced and which brings his family so much shame. Fearful of making his father’s mistakes, Okonkwo works tirelessly in hopes of outrunning his father’s legacy and redeeming his family name. Like Okonkwo, my siblings and I were brought up charged with the duty of tending to the fertile fields of our minds. Unlike Okonkwo, we were taught that poor harvest days would inevitably come and to never lose hope that the next one could be better. In this environment, my siblings and I worked diligently in school to expand our worldview, aiming at a target beyond the sky, in the cultivation of our gifts and the refinement of our talents.
In my recent perusal through Achebe’s work, the author champions this approach. In the novel, it is the asymmetry in the knowledge of the missionaries compared to the natives that subdues Okonkwo and his men, rather than the colonizers’ faith or weaponry (as the Igbos had plenty of guns and gods to match their own). Evident in the efficacy of their “white man’s medicine” and their triumph over the “evil forest,”  this disparity sows the seeds of discord among Okonkwo’s clan, eventually leading to its downfall.
Properly viewed, Okonkwo’s story is a cautionary tale especially relevant to a generation whose digital absorption often treads a line between relaxation and relapse into internet addiction. A flawed man, Okonkwo’s story still has much to offer in both his climb up the social hierarchy and, perhaps more significantly, in his fall from it. In Okonkwo, the reader can observe the awful intergenerational aftermath that unchecked sloth can have even on its most defiant victims.
Like Achebe, my grandmother believed that there was a redemptive power in industry, a virtue she passed on to all her grandchildren. More than an entertaining fairytale, Okonkwo’s story serves as a wakeup call. Even in the chosen name “Okonkwo” (a surname quite common among the Igbos), Achebe displays mastery of his craft. In observing the tragic arc of Okonkwo's life, the reader is called to recant slothfulness and exhibit Okonkwo’s zeal in our own lives, perhaps without the damaging fear that accompanied his own. If not, the tragic fate of Okonkwo may well prove to be our own for succumbing to the snares of idleness.

Whether she’s wearing slabs of meat, inflatable tentacles, or a Picasso painting, Lady Gaga has always been larger than life. She is glamorously, defiantly exaggerated, putting on a carefully curated display of performative female power that refuses to be sweetened or tamed. She is a show in and of herself — and beneath the bedazzled eyebrows and infamous poker face, she’s untouchable.
At least, that is the Lady Gaga we’ve come to know and love. But in Bradley Cooper’s exuberant directorial debut “A Star is Born,” Lady Gaga peels away the costumes to reveal a raw power that is, in many ways, more of a thrill than any of her wildest costumes.
“A Star is Born” centers around the personal and professional relationship between aging country legend Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) and his new prodigy, waitress-turned-popstar Ally (Lady Gaga). It is the third in a series of remakes of the 1937 original, the first in 1954 and the second, and more famous, in 1976 (starring Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand). Thankfully, Cooper’s version is not only freshly reimagined in many ways, but far ahead of its predecessors in the nuance and agency of its protagonists and the quality of its powerhouse soundtrack.
With much of its momentum resting on its established celebrity leads, Gaga in particular determined to forge a new career path, “A Star is Born” would seem like a movie with something to prove. But unlike many of its genre-defying artist counterparts — like “Dunkirk” with Harry Styles or “Beauty and the Beast” with Emma Watson — “A Star is Born” will obliterate any doubt about Cooper’s singing and Lady Gaga’s acting abilities from the outset. In the very first shot, Cooper saunters on stage in front of a waiting audience, grabs hold of the microphone, and delivers a gripping, grimy, rendition of his original song “Black Eyes” that is both technically and emotionally thrilling. Cooper leaves no doubt in our minds: He is just as capable of spellbinding a rock-concert audience as he is at capturing the layers of his volatile protagonist.
Lady Gaga, for her part, is absolutely riveting as Ally, reinventing the “girl who needs a man to believe in her” archetype by imbuing it with a kind of brittle compassion that is just as devoid of ulterior “sweetness” as it is fiercely, selflessly unshakeable. Like Cooper, she takes full advantage of her first scene, letting out a scream of “Fucking men!” into a bathroom mirror before switching, almost out of nowhere, to a deadpan nonchalance while she sulks back out to her waitressing job. From that moment on, Lady Gaga delivers a soulful, glassy-eyed, down-to-earth performance that is sure to establish her as a serious — and enchanting — actress.
While Cooper and Lady Gaga are both incredible on their own, the relationship they build is what makes this iteration of "A Star is Born" really worth seeing. Their relationship is far from a storybook romance, and it is its messiness, not its perfection, that makes it compelling. The movie’s most memorable moments revolve around that messiness, as Jackson and Ally throw themselves into each other’s arms in an attempt to fill the voids inside themselves and reel from the fissures in the deep, violent bond they form. Jackson’s alcoholism plays a large part in the dysfunction in their relationship and, unlike in previous versions of the story, it’s a part of his character from the very beginning. That choice, motivated perhaps in part by Cooper’s own struggles with alcoholism and recovery, makes the narrative of Jackson’s spiral less about competition with Ally and more about his own demons. As a result, Cooper’s Jackson reads as sympathetic, even if he’s hard to love in many of his lowest moments. But for all the ways Cooper supposedly reinvents himself in “A Star is Born,” he never loses his signature ability to sell a vulnerable, kind-hearted antihero.
Cooper is perhaps less adept at defining the limits of the “forgiveness” that Ally owes to Jackson. There are points where the movie feels so solely focused on Jackson that it never bothers to question Ally’s willingness to put up with his destructive behavior. This imbalance is only heightened by the assumption  — one that’s accompanied this storyline from its first iteration — that it’s inevitable, even reasonable, for Jackson to feel jealous and humiliated by Ally’s success. Given the way Lady Gaga plays Ally as a tough, self-possessed character, her almost unquestioning loyalty to Jackson feels very out of character. Cooper’s version of “A Star is Born” may allow Ally more agency than its predecessor, but it still falls into the trap of romanticizing her until she feels more idealized than real. As a result, the movie can feel like it’s waffling between real female empowerment and its elusive approximation.
Perhaps Ally’s willingness to put up with Jackson’s jealousy would feel more understandable if it was grounded in character, but it seems to conflict with the strength and firmness we see in Ally earlier in the movie. Cooper’s version of “A Star Is Born” may allow Ally more agency than its predecessor, but it still falls into the trap of romanticizing her until she feels more idealized than real. As a result, the movie waffles between real female empowerment and an elusive approximation.
Cooper’s take on “A Star Is Born” is not a perfect movie. But buoyed by outstanding performances from Cooper and Lady Gaga, thrilling concert scenes, and a fabulous original soundtrack, it manages to turn a simple story into something that is thoughtful, exhilarating, and incredibly fun to watch. After it leaves its signature song, “Shallow,” stuck in your head, it will also leave you convinced that Lady Gaga is a true tour-de-force, no matter which side of the “fame monster” she’s on. ​​​​​​​

Tucked into the Cambridge Community Television building in the heart of Central Square lies a hidden exhibition showcasing the work of local artists: “Sprouts: Fresh Work from Cambridge Art’s Community Supported Art Program.” As a part of the Cambridge Arts Creative Marketplace, the idea behind the program is similar to a farm share: One can support local artists just as one supports local farmers and agriculture. A jury of curators and other art professionals have selected just a small handful of artists to showcase their work in this space. In addition to showcasing the artists’ work and paying them to make art to sell, the program provides training in business and other career advancing opportunities.
Magali Maiza, the program director at Cambridge Arts explained the idea behind the Cambridge Arts Creative Marketplace was an intention to create and maintain a visual art scene that seems alive. Maiza said she understands the “realistic pressure” of being an artist in a city such as Cambridge.
“Part of our work at the Cambridge Art Council is to support the artists. This is really the core of the program,” she said. Now in its third year running, this exhibition has helped over 20 local artists get on their feet. Magali said she sees the program as a “small cultural startup.” Not only does this exhibition provide a platform for these local artists to sell their work, the training and programming propels these artists to continue creating. Though the Sprouts Exhibition only occupies a small physical space, there is a larger meaning and vision behind it.
The exhibition dedicates a small space for the work of each of the seven artists. There is a vast array of mediums and ideas, ranging from photography to watercolor to monotype print to glass work. Cory Shea, a digital artist, displays her experimental ceramic tiles adjacent to her digital images. Some artists, like Leah Pillsbury, instead produced sketches and monotype prints of figures on the beach. Other artists, like Emily Cobb, created a series of playful watercolors that are meant to be assembled in a folding book. Artist Susan Murie works with cyanotype prints on cotton and linen paper, and Xian Ho displays a woodblock painting of decaying raspberries and blackberries.
In addition to displaying their art, each artist provided a short statement and answered two questions: Why have they joined the Community Supported Art Program? What is behind their Community Supported Art Project? One artist, Jessica Caponigro, describes herself as an interdisciplinary artist who displays a work of digital photography as well as a performance ephemera piece at the exhibition. She wrote about how much she appreciates the accessibility of the Community Arts Program on a caption hung by her work at the show.
“Accessibility and the idea that art should be for everyone, not just the very wealthy or very privileged, is at the core of everything,” she wrote.
For artist Peter McCarthy, being a part of the Sprouts exhibition has offered remarkable opportunities for his career as an artist. McCarthy primarily focuses on glass making, and he said he is continually experimenting with this medium.
“I wanted to become more serious with my art as a profession and the program has been wonderful to help me do that,” McCarthy said. He says being a part of this program has been guiding and pushing his art on this business aspect of artmaking as well.
“In terms of marketing, in terms of figuring out how something is a good product, what the marketplace looks like, it has given me some real tools both for that marketing but also some physical tools, like here at the CCTV, the ability to use their photography equipment,” McCarthy said.

Gary Shteyngart, the author of countless New York Times bestsellers, uses language as a medium, creating vivid landscapes and deeply complex characters in his newly released book, “Lake Success.” In this extremely realistic fiction, Barry Cohen lives a life most people strive for. He graduated from an Ivy League school, founded a successful financial investment company, married his best friend and love of his life, and recently had a beautiful child. However, in no time at all, this god-like figure quickly becomes human with a series of revelations throughout the first chapter. Even titans of Wall Street with billions of dollars of assets under management can fall. This story paints the modern-day picture of two people’s journey for the American Dream. Because of the depth of characters, beauty of locations, and relatability of the everyday struggles every person deals with, this book captures the interest of a wide audience while questioning the beliefs of our culture.
As convoluted as the clichéd American Dream may be for some, most would equate it to wealth and contentment. Barry Cohen believes it is much simpler. All he wants in the world are two things: three duravit sinks for his three sons and a collection of fine watches. He must confront the reduced likelihood of this when his first son, Shiva, is placed on the autism spectrum at two years old. Having a child born on the autism spectrum puts a crack in the rich man’s family dream. For the top 0.1%, wearing the wrong watch one day could be considered a minor catastrophe, but life for the Cohens changed forevermore when Shiva was born. Like many people today, they wholeheartedly believe that their fantasy life can only be accomplished through certain criteria.
Although this story seems to be told solely from the perspective of high society in their glass-sided, multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments, and perfect lives, from the first page it is apparent that these characters are no different from the people they pass on the street or talk to in restaurants or bars. Very quickly Barry is broken down and forced into a life that is quite different than his routine hedge-fund financed day-to-day. All the while he is sitting next to and talking to people running to and away from their fears, on adventures much more daunting. The characters of “Lake Success” are everyday people: cis and trans men and women, people of color, different ethnicities, different ages, different abilities. The journey may have been made with his two goals in mind, but along the way Barry encountered what truly makes America so unique: the people. This truly humanistic approach taken by Shteyngart is one of many reasons this book has the opportunity to resonate with such a wide audience.
It is these people, fictional characters based loosely on generalities of our nation but so alive with stories each their own, that lends this story its value. Along with the vibrant characters, the scenery erupts around the characters. The trees of Central Park and the harsh concrete of the city all blossom in the imagination of the reader with the prompting of Barry Cohen and his journey. Throughout this story, people grow and change, love falls away and comes back. Gary Shteyngart crafted not a fiction but the life of a “narcissistic, hilariously self-deluded, and divorced from the real world” man. “Lake Success” showed a honest, real-life struggle of one self-made American family in an eloquent book that even hedge fund managers could enjoy.

With a blur of color and a plot that will always keep you guessing, “Maniac,” a new Netflix original directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga and starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, came out on Sept. 21. Fukunaga, who landed himself an Emmy in 2014 for his masterful direction of “True Detective”’s first season, manages to craft a dramedy with enough ambiguity to keep the audience enticed and unapologetically walk the line between bizarre and ludicrous. Although its important, positive message about friendship is partially smothered by the show’s overwhelmingly dark tone, “Maniac” and its talented cast deliver something refreshing, unpredictable, and surprisingly hilarious.
Set in an aggressively consumerist, highly medicated, near-future world where everything is slightly off-kilter — N.Y.C. features a monument known as the “Statue of Extra Liberty,” and people know as “Ad-Buddies” follow you around all day, reciting commercials — two strangers named Owen (Hill) and Annie (Stone) end up tangled in an experimental drug trial at Nerberdine Pharmaceuticals and Biotech.
What really shines through in this psychedelic trip of a show is the generally stellar performances from most of the cast — not that we’d expect anything less from its star-studded group of bright Hollywood A-listers. Considering Stone recently won the hearts of millions as the young-hearted, vulnerable, and determined Mia in“La La Land,” her ability to transform into the crazy-eyed, thick-skinned, and defeatist junkie Annie demonstrates her versatility as an actor. Her slow crawl from the pit of grief towards eventual acceptance of her sister’s tragic death is the most satisfying character arch as well as the most emotionally stirring aspect of the show.
Though the wacky, disastrous interactions between the scientists at Nerberdine Lab is technically the “B-plot,” they are the fuel that powers the bizarre but charming humor of the show. In particular, despite Justin Theroux having the magnetism and good looks to portray a “McDreamy”-esque doctor heartthrob, he instead repulses and amuses the audience as Dr. James Mantleray, the original creator of the U.L.P. drug treatment. Never wavering in his commitment to the character, Theroux lures us in as a brilliant yet pathetic psychologist with a virtual-reality hentai addiction, an Oedipus complex worse than Hamlet’s, and a hilariously obvious toupee. He’s like a car crash you can’t look away from.
To the true fans of “Superbad,” the notion of an Emma Stone and Jonah Hill reunion is exciting, yet the two initially lacked the anticipated natural chemistry. Considering Hill’s real-life charisma and brilliant comedic timing, his portrayal of the hopelessly alienated and schizophrenic Owen Milgrim is — just notice his gaunt face, intense eye bags, low, mumbling voice, and seemingly extinguished lifeforce — yet also particularly disturbing. His guarded and timid personality left little for me to cling to and made me hope that he’d start hurling insults at Mclovin like the good ol’ days.
“Episode 4: Furs By Sebastian,” however, marks a significant turning point in the Annie-Owen relationship and acts as an adrenaline shot to the show’s previously dreary heart. As this therapeutic drug trial of three separate pills that are supposed to replace the need for therapy continues, the show abruptly transports us into Annie and Owen’s conjoined mind for some vivid yet fictional dream sequences. Shifting to the vibrant, tacky world of the ’80s, Owen and Annie are now a trashy married couple hunting down a pet lemur that has been stolen by fur-coat makers. While such a sudden change in style could destroy the pace of the series, Fukanaga and writer Patrick Somerville’s risk ends up being the show’s saving grace mainly because of the freedom it lends its actors, especially Jonah Hill. It brightened the entire dark world of “Maniac” to see the suddenly invigorated Owen shapeshifting between episodes into a dim-witted, football-loving, but ultimately good-hearted husband with a mullet and a hilarious Icelander whose cartoonish accent is the only thing more ridiculous than his blonde wig.
But while trying to juggle hope with the crushing harshness of reality, this dark comedy leans too strongly toward bleak emptiness, creating an off-balance and undermining its overall message about the importance of connection. The writers prove they do have heart by cheesily teaming Annie and Owen up. Unfortunately, this moment of sunshine is diluted when contrasted with so much human failure and ugliness. If anything, the show, though undoubtedly entertaining, seems to suggest that the human mind, naturally adapted for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the desert, doesn’t seem capable of handling the exponentially growing pressures of modern life and moves closer and closer to total mental breakdown.
“Maniac” provides enough mad science and drug experimentation to fill the “Stranger-Things”-sized void in America’s soul as they wait for the third season, yet lacks nostalgia or a much needed, warm, fuzzy feeling. Even still, if you are craving something dark and twisted after the plague of gushy Netflix rom-coms or like the sound of Wes Anderson’s delightful awkwardness, mixed with Stanley Kubrick’s ambitious aesthetic, and sprinkled with some Martin Scorsese-style brutalism, certainly give “Maniac” a try.

The final trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindewald” broke the news that Voldemort’s pet snake, Nagini, used to be a human long before she appeared in the Harry Potter series. How long had J.K. Rowling been harboring this backstory in her mind? “Only for around 20 years,” she tweeted. In Rowling’s novels, Nagini slithers around Voldemort’s feet, lives to obey his murder orders, houses part of his soul, and habitually sinks her venomous fangs into his victims. By contrast, the upcoming spinoff will show her as a human circus performer whose blood curse will eventually turn her into a snake forever. To complicate the situation even more, the trailer reveals that her human form is South Korean actress Claudia Kim dressed as a reptilian cabaret goth.
The casting of an Asian woman in Nagini’s role has been controversial. It should be. From the little information we have about pre-Horcrux Nagini, it still looks awfully possible that the screenwriters designed the persona by dumping several Hollywood-produced Orientalist stereotypes into a cauldron and stirring them with a pinch of magic. (Warner Bros. is a Hollywood studio, though they filmed in Leavesden.)
The Nagini we know from the books is not just subservient, but a literal servant whose every tail flick is attuned to Voldemort’s will. She also harbors the coldness and aggression that mark a “Dragon Lady” caricature when transferred onto an East Asian woman, and she renders literal the monster-human dichotomy that is usually a figurative description. Finally, the character seems to approximate the Asian woman prostitute caricature as well. Though she does not perform sex work, the display of her body in a circus is a queasy plot point, especially when combined with her sexually suggestive presentation (as seen in the trailer) and future of servitude to a man (as seen in the book series).
These are the same stereotypes that facilitated the United States’ xenophobia, systematic deportations, and colonialism and militarism in Asia. These themes, in turn, are manifestations of the theme of intolerance that “Harry Potter” as a whole condemns. In other words, this character has the potential to be terrible.
However, no character can be fully assessed based on a trailer, and she also has the potential to be an unconventional and bold addition to the films. A few things could redeem the new Nagini, and I am holding out hope for these developments come Nov. 16, when “Fantastic Beasts” hits theaters.
This backstory could be a puzzle piece filling a gap in the main book series. Though some are skeptical that Rowling had planned Nagini’s human backstory for decades, one reason to believe her is that the name “Nagini” comes from a mythology of human-snake creatures. This origin might also explain how Nagini was able to embody Bathilda Bagshot in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.” Hopefully, the character will be consistent with and enhance the stories we are familiar with.
In the Muggle universe, another helpful development would be accurate cultural citations. Though Rowling defended the casting by tweeting that the myth of the Naga came from Indonesia, author Amish Tripathi responded by writing that the myth is of Indian origin. Yikes. Attributing an Indian myth to Indonesia to justify casting a South Korean actress was not a strong strategy. On the bright side, it has introduced a fiery conversation about Eastern mythology to this Western-centric franchise.
Still, the best thing to see from Nagini would be a non-stereotypical character arc. We know how her story ends. Her subservience is inevitable, as is her brutal death. But along the way, her motivations, relationships, and personality traits could very well be more compelling than the prostitute, servant, and “Dragon Lady” identities implied so far.
Though much of the Harry Potter plotline is an allegory for racial discrimination, J.K. Rowling has not provided readers with any strong characters of color — around nine minor characters are identifiable as people of color. None are “favorite character” material. The novels feature three Asian women (Cho Chang and Padma and Parvati Patil), whose personalities are best summarized as “annoying” and whose most prominent moments are as romantic placeholders in the main characters’ love lives. So the stakes for each new non-white character are high. Along with Nagini, the “Fantastic Beasts” movies have two more opportunities for complex characterizations in Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz) and President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo). My dream is that “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindewald” will provide us with an even bigger plot twist than Nagini’s human origin story. The happiest surprise would be for the character to wriggle free of Hollywood’s stereotype boxes and, in the process, amplify the franchise’s call for diversity.
Correction: Oct. 9, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Cho Chang and Padma and Parvati Patil are Asian-American. In fact, they are not American.

In 2009, the year after Beyonce Knowles released “Single Ladies,” Kanye West stormed the Video Music Awards stage. Taylor Swift had just won Best Female Video for “You Belong With Me” when West grabbed the microphone from Swift and yelled, “Beyonce has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!” This infamous story is the starting point for an important inquiry into the intersection of Blackness and art. Kanye made a normative claim about Beyonce’s work. He did not say that Taylor Swift won because she is white, or that Beyonce lost because she is Black. These claims, indeed true, were certainly implied by his outburst. But what he said was that “Beyonce has one of the best videos of all time.” What he said was that Beyonce’s art was good, was better, was the best.
Does Beyonce make good art? In the history of the Grammy Awards, a hip-hop album has only won twice. In fact, a Black woman has not been awarded the prestigious Album of the Year prize since 1999, when Lauryn Hill won for “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” And worse, this most prestigious honor has been awarded to only 12 albums made by Black artists over the course of its 60-year existence.
Beyonce has never won Album of the Year. So does Beyonce make good art? If we trust music awards and those responsible for their winners, then she clearly does not. What Kanye was saying is that this lack of validation is not a sign of poor quality but is rather rooted in anti-Blackness and misogynoir.
In 2018, after years of disregard by the Academy — by any Academy, really — Beyonce finally decided to weigh in on Kanye’s claim. In August, without warning, she dropped the music video for “Apeshit,” a single from her and Jay Z’s joint album “Everything Is Love.” In this video, she quite effectively attempts to convince the world that Kanye was right: Her art, Black art, is fine art.
“Apeshit” frames the Carters among the art showcased in the Louvre. They first appear in the video in front of the Mona Lisa. The three faces — Mona Lisa’s, Jay Z’s, and Beyonce’s — stare at the camera, united as a Trinity of masterpieces. From there on, the Carters rap and dance among the artistic masterpieces, often mimicking or bleeding into them. Beyonce begins her first verse on the ground in front of the famed sculpture “The Winged Victory of Samothrace.” Her white gown matches the color and texture of the marble from which the sculpture is hewn. As she lies on the ground beside the piece, she essentially becomes part of it.
The Carters, and the Black bodies they carry, establish themselves as equal to the Mona Lisa herself. Blackness, for Beyonce, is no barrier to aesthetic perfection. Beyonce asserts that she should have won that VMA. She announces, in no uncertain terms, that she is better than a Grammy. She is fine art. She, hip hop, Black art, Black people, belong in the Louvre.
Beyonce’s realignment of the bounds of fine art, welcoming Black creation into the realm of the aesthetically good, certainly seems radical. But is it? The aesthetic quality of “Apeshit” is in line with the Carters’ broader financial ambitions. Beyonce’s and Jay Z’s verses are stunts. They flex their cash, and their power. Beyonce opens her first verse with the line “Gimme my check.” In the video, the Carters wear high-end fabric, and weigh down their necks with gold chains. They are art because they have money. Beyonce receives the status of fine art only through absorption into and dependence on capitalism. This is quite literal: As commentators have pointed out, it is only thanks to the Carters’ substantial wealth and power that they are able to stage their art in the Louvre in the first place.
The category of “fine art” depends on power. Goodness, as it is commonly construed, depends on whiteness, but only inasmuch as whiteness depends on power. To become “good,” to bring Blackness into the realm of high art, Beyonce embraces the power of wealth. While distinct from that of whiteness, power derived from capitalist notions of wealth remains deeply problematic. This, after all, is the central debate over the validity of Black Capitalism, a Black liberation ideology often criticized for its focus on assimilation into capitalist structures.
Is this use of problematic power the only option Black artists have? Of course, it remains to be seen if this strategy will even succeed. Can we expect a Grammy for “Apeshit”? Only time will tell.
But beyond questions of success, we might wonder if there exists other options for Black artists, and indeed all marginalized artists. Can these artists find liberation without institutionalized power? Can their art can find value and meaning outside of the oppressive definitions of good art? It is possible that the notion of “good art” itself ought to be dismantled and discarded, that wanting to be good — where good means fitting in the conditions of a white, patriarchal, classist art world — is not even worth our time. What if Beyonce didn’t want a Grammy? What if we don’t need a seat at the table?

On Aug. 17, Young Thug was arrested at his own birthday party. On Sept. 7, he was charged with eight counts related to an earlier arrest. For some, this legal trouble punctuated an ongoing decline in Thug’s career: After two disappointing albums, many felt the rapper had passed his prime. With his new EP, “On The Rvn,” Thug proves his critics wrong. "On The Rvn" echoes the recent Yeezy Season releases in its brevity and quality; its six tracks, for the most part, recall his old music and add new dimensions to his sound.
As its title suggests, Young Thug’s run-ins with the law loom over "On The Rvn." Thug’s lyrics on the EP are, as always, somewhat empty. But this does not mean "On The Rvn" has no message. What Thug lacks in eloquence he makes up in expressiveness, and his indomitable energy and effortless charisma are powerful on this EP. Across the project, Thug’s tone is triumphant. "On The Rvn" sends a clear message: Although Thug may soon be behind bars, he is far from defeated.
Out of "On The Rvn"’s many solid tracks, two stand out as distinctly new. “Climax (feat. 6lack)” sees Thug at his most vulnerable. The song opens with Thug’s ghostly warbling over an a cappella-style rhythm. Soon guitar chords come in, evoking the acoustic sound Thug explored on “Beautiful Thugger Girls.” London on da Track’s minimal beat brings energy to the song, and 6lack’s deep, buttery singing compliments Thug’s treble. The track’s melody comes from a Shiloh song — a possible homage to XXXTentacion, who sampled the singer’s music on several hits and was recently killed.
"On The Rvn" makes history with its other standout song. “High (feat. Elton John)” is an affirmation of the mumbliest of mumble rap by an elder statesman of rock music. Accompanied by rich piano chords and a melodic snare, Thug’s verses interweave beautifully with a sample from Elton John’s “Rocket Man.” Together, the two artists share a wistful yet optimistic conversation across generations and genres. It is an apt collaboration. Elton John was one of the first openly gay pop stars. And Young Thug, though straight, has shattered norms in his own way, introducing gender-bending fashions to rap, an often hyper-masculine genre.
The EP’s other tracks range from good to adequate. In general, they represent a return to the style that made Thug famous. Jaden Smith delivers a solid feature on “Sin,” a bass-heavy banger. Thug brings out some of his catchiest hooks and some unusually well-enunciated, Lil Uzi Vert-esque flows on “Real in my Veins.” Neither the title track nor “Icey” find their direction, however. For an opener, “On the Run” is bland. And “Icey”’s lack of a compelling hook is disappointing, as its beat is one of the EP’s most energetic.
That said, Young Thug is back. Though it is not a lyrical or a complex EP, "On The Rvn" is an EP of optimism and of defiance. Ever since Thug’s 2011 tape “I Came From Nothing” dropped, the rapper’s mainstream moment has been waiting for him, forever on the horizon. "On The Rvn" may be the project that finally puts Thug on the charts. With futuristic production, catchy hooks, and high-impact features, the EP is suited for the moment, dependable yet innovative. It is a sad irony that Young Thug’s breakout may come just as he gets locked up.

“Women writers don’t sell,” proclaims our eponymous heroine’s controlling “literary entrepreneur” husband Willy (a fabulously smarmy Dominic West) about halfway through “Colette.” The irony is rich — and not only because the real Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette ultimately became one of the greatest prose writers of the early 20th Century. Just as Colette (Keira Knightley) keeps her wayward husband afloat by ghostwriting novels that are “the toast of Paris,” so too does Knightley carry the biopic from beginning to end. Based on a remarkable true story, “Colette” is less a period piece and more a seductive and cheerful romp through one woman’s dramatic actualization of her physical and intellectual autonomy.
Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette leads a bucolic life in the French countryside before her passionate romance with Willy, who marries this provincial girl and transports her into the big city. Willy then parades Colette around his wealthy literary Parisian scene, which the movie paints in a beautifully scored, whirlwind edit of shi-shi cocktail parties and well-choreographed waltzes. We follow Knightley’s expressive face from afar as she takes it all in, at once disgusted and intrigued by the opulence and pretension she sees around her. This push and pull within Colette, her simultaneous revilement of and attraction to her luxurious surroundings as she grows into them, pervades the film with an appealing nuance.
Due to Willy’s extravagant spending habits on everything from gambling to other women, his novel-making factory struggles to get by, and so he enlists Colette to write her “schoolgirl stories” under his name. The rest is indeed history: The “Claudine” series, ostensibly written by Willy, flies off the shelves. Yet behind the scenes, Willy becomes increasingly demanding and obsessive, bribing his wife into writing more by purchasing her a country house and locking Colette into a room with nothing but a typewriter when she refuses to write another story for him. Though played somewhat for laughs, Willy’s abusive behavior is no joke, and Colette finds her own small ways to rebel against him at first — making her own friends, for example, and pursuing interpretive dance as a hobby. Where the movie (and indeed the historical narrative) divulges from the conventional is Colette’s foray into lesbian relationships and experimentation with her gender expression. The film’s decidedly radical-for-the-time depictions of narratives that are, today, frequently explored themes, would seem like a millennial spin on the period piece genre, until one remembers that the real Colette was practicing gender and sexual fluidity far before such behaviors were cool — when it was still in fact illegal for common women to wear pants.
As always, Knightley embodies her petticoats and lace frocks with conviction — though here she swaps out the corset for an occasional dapper suit. Her innate defiance is given full room to breathe in this film, after being employed many times over in Romantic period dramas that require a repressed, steely gaze from a classically beautiful waif. It should be mentioned that Knightley embodies the distinct queerness of this film with authentic aplomb — no surprise to those of us who have adored the actress since her turn as a sporty, sexually ambiguous gamine in “Bend It Like Beckham” (2002). And “Colette” on its whole, in depicting both straight and lesbian sexual encounters, is not only relatively progressive, but also quite sensual. Willy and Colette develop a complex bedroom politic, one that ultimately involves them sleeping with the same woman. “When you bat your eyelids it’s as if you are taking off my clothes,” murmurs Collette in her first female dalliance. A bare, heaving bosom is lingered on; facial expressions in climax abound. Yet the salaciousness stays highbrow and tightly edited — perhaps due to director Wash Westmoreland’s previous experience helming well-reviewed gay pornographic films.
The movie does lose steam in the third act, as the somewhat fantastical plot points of this true story force Westmoreland to hit some odd beats. Although Colette’s scandalous pseudo-Egyptian dance number at the Moulin Rouge with her masculine-of-center aristocrat lover Missy (Denise Gough) did actually occur, the lengthy scene feels like a disjointed tonal interlude within the scope of the film. And Westmoreland checks the boxes of the saga’s later years without much exposition, other than Willy’s beard getting grayer and his stomach growing larger with each passing scene. But through it all, Colette is steadfast, fettering her indignation until she finally explodes at Willy with deeply satisfying eloquence.
Despite its few missteps towards the end, the film ultimately reaches a smart, satisfying conclusion. In the final sequence, the camera zooms in close on Knightley’s fierce face. Heavy liner frames her darting eyes, as dark as the two forceful lines that recur under Colette’s signature. She has claimed the gaze of the spectator, the title of artist that was so wrongfully denied from her for so many years. Finally, Colette is a woman in full possession of herself — and that makes her a renegade in any era.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent years, the notion that animated pictures are tantamount to childish humor and sugar-coated depictions of reality has begun to break down as kids’ entertainment features social commentary more and more prominently. Following the success of movies such as “Inside Out” and “Zootopia” — which present nuanced explorations of mental health and racial profiling, respectively — director Karey Kirkpatrick’s “Smallfoot” blatantly yet effectively tackles the topic of truth and its relationships with religion and stereotypes, starting a conversation on screens worldwide that few can have even with their closest friends and family.
The movie opens with a series of cave paintings and a voiceover that explain the principal beliefs of Yeti culture: First, their creation myth states that their snow-capped mountain home fell out of a giant yak’s backside; second, a designated gong-ringer must hit a metal disk every morning in order to make a magic snail carry the sun across the sky; third, all the rules that define society and the world are scrawled on special rocks kept by their leader, the Stonekeeper (Common); and finally, humans must not exist because the rocks say so. The introduction simultaneously demands comparisons between the Yetis’ religion and real-world faiths (which are most glaringly obvious in how the Stonekeeper’s rocks parallel holy books in function) and cleverly frames the rest of the film like a mathematical proof by first presenting a ridiculous belief to be later debunked by the discovery of various pieces of evidence.
Such scientific treatment of even the plot structure hints at Kirkpatrick’s answer to the controversial question that “Smallfoot” asks: Is truth found in religion or in methodical exploration of the world? While its plot twists and happy ending may be predictable, “Smallfoot” stands out with its mature commentary on the importance of questioning what is presented as repetition, a salient topic for both children and adults in this age of political cover-ups and sensational media.
The story’s protagonist is a Yeti named Migo (Channing Tatum) who lives peacefully among his kind in the snowy Himalayas until he encounters a human — a Smallfoot, as they are called in lore. However, his discovery is not taken well by his village, who are adamant that the rocks of law can never be wrong, leading to his banishment. In Migo’s quest to bring another human back to his community and prove himself right, he joins a ragtag band of other believers in Smallfoot comprised of Meechee (Zendaya), the surprisingly rebellious daughter of the Stonekeeper, Kolka (Gina Rodriguez), Gwangi (LeBron James), and Fleem (Ely Henry), the quippy coward serving as comic relief, all of whom collect clues suggesting human existence and demonstrate an affinity for more scientific ways of thinking than the rest of the Yetis.
Meanwhile, Percy (James Corden), a nature reporter in the Himalayas, is grappling with his own crisis surrounding truth: He must decide between presenting the public with honest, “boring” facts about the environment that would sink his career, and staging fake animal attacks to boost his ratings. During Migo and Percy’s first encounter, a close shot of each of their faces shows each character through the eyes of the other. From Migo’s perspective, human words sound like incomprehensible squeaking and he immediately assumes Percy has no language skills. To Percy, Migo’s excited gestures seem like threatening posturing. The comical exaggeration of their fear and misunderstanding illustrates how ridiculous it is for different races or social groups to harbor unfounded, negative assumptions about each other. The scene is a tactful addition to the film’s central argument as it clarifies the movie’s purpose as an examination of the harms of blind belief in all its manifestations rather than a critique of religion in particular.
Later, Percy’s arrival in Migo’s mountain village sets off a rapid period of enlightenment in which the Yeti population questions their sacred rocks, embraces human culture, and experiments with their environment, leading to technological developments such as the invention of an airplane. The differences between the heavily religious Yeti society at the beginning of the film and the scientifically advanced civilization near the end seems to pit religion and science against each other as polar opposites, with the former facilitating ignorance and prejudice while the latter catalyzes societal improvement. The large contrast in imagery weakens the film, with its rather one-sided portrayal of religion. The distinction between criticism of religion that fosters ignorance and commentary on religion as a general practice becomes blurred by the movie’s end.
Overall, however, Kirkpatrick deserves praise for delivering a nuanced exploration of truth and how it affects both personal perceptions and society at large, especially considering that he easily could have rehashed a trite parable about the virtues of honesty instead, like so many children’s programs do. Though Kirkpatrick is no newcomer to whimsical fantasy films, given his work on “James and the Giant Peach,” “Charlotte’s Web,” and “The Spiderwick Chronicles,” “Smallfoot” arguably holds more social significance than any of his previous works by bringing a controversial topic to the forefront through an accessible, playful story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the University announced that two cultural Greek organizations targeted to African-Americans would remained unaffected by its sanctions on social groups. The University ostensibly did so because these groups — Alpha Phi Alpha and Alpha Kappa Alpha — have memberships that span multiple schools, and are therefore technically exempt from Harvard’s new sanctions regime.
However, the administration seems to be addressing these two organizations with a very tenuous line of logical reasoning. If Harvard truly believes that all social organizations that are gender-exclusive must go co-ed, then groups like Alpha Phi Alpha and Alpha Kappa Alpha must be sanctioned. There should certainly not be an exception merely because these groups have memberships that span multiple universities, and the distinction on this front between these groups and sanctioned Harvard sororities and fraternities with chapters at other universities is shaky.
If Harvard believes that social groups with an explicit cultural focus deserve special treatment in a way that groups that lack that focus do not, it should make that case and defend it. One possible defense would be that some organizations serve dual purposes. Perhaps Alpha Kappa Alpha and Alpha Phi Alpha are both social clubs and affinity groups.
Should the University make this argument, it should also clarify the role of other cultural social groups. For example, after the sanctions were announced, the cultural Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi became the gender-neutral Aleph last year. However, under this argument, that move might have been unnecessary.
The claim that it is Alpha Phi Alpha and Alpha Kappa Alpha’s multi-school membership that protects them from being sanctioned may also open a new loophole for clubs dealing with sanctions. Can any final club on campus simply admit a single non-Harvard student in order to become ineligible for sanctioning?
Ultimately, Harvard needs to make some type of decision. Instead of citing membership from multiple schools as the reason for the lack of sanctions, it should either recognize and accept these cultural social groups as is, or it should sanction these groups as unrecognized single-gender social organizations.
Any other course of action is insufficient. Indeed, any sort of special categorization of these cultural groups — in this case, groups with a focus on the black community — would otherize them in a peculiar way. The University should be able to discuss race openly. Unfortunately, it seems as though the University has seized upon any other reason to avoid having such a discussion.
If the University truly believes that its sanction policy is right as is, then it ought to stand by it and apply it fairly. However, if it believes that the sanctions do not provide sufficient protections for important cultural organizations, then it should state so explicitly and seek to change its policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve been seeing signs outside Canaday, Sever, and the Science Center advertising a “socialist future,” and I have to say I’m not entirely opposed — provided we’re talking about the same socialism.
By socialism, I mean government intervention on a small scale. Think Alaska’s Permanent Fund, which draws revenues from oil companies to distribute an annual monetary stipend to state residents. That model is overwhelmingly supported by Alaskans and has shown sustainable growth over its five-decade lifespan (in addition to spillover economic benefits). It’s also smarter than the average wealth transfer, taking into account fund size, growth, and government spending needs in its calculation of dividend amount. If this is socialism, it’s socialism with an economic conscience.
Or think North Dakota. The state-run Bank of North Dakota was founded in 1919 by the Non-Partisan League (a party of ex-socialists) to shield farmers from high-cost, out-of-state loans. Today, the bank extends low-interest credit to farmers, students, and local businesses. This model, which saw profits even at the height of the great recession, has now inspired Los Angeles residents to consider a similar bank for themselves.
Many of us were taught the failures of old-school socialism as children — its grandiose world-building schemes and dreams of a new “Soviet man,” which failed to convince citizens amid food shortages and rampant corruption. We learned that China’s Communist Party voted for market-based reforms after Mao’s death to lessen the suffering of millions.
Strangely, the new socialist models seem to have inherited a penchant for politics from on high. The Democratic Socialists of America— the U.S.’s largest and fastest-growing socialist organization — commit in their platform to “internationalist politics,” “deeper cross-national ties” between workers, and nationalizing key industries. Even from a grassroots activist organization, these slogans evoke the Soviet world-stage mentality of old. “No ‘rank-and-file activism’ outside of global ends” seems to be the message.
Yet it’s not hard to envision a different sort of big government: public banks and credit unions at the state level, municipal social safety nets, and tailored tax-and-spend policies designed for local contexts. These models of public economic reform would emphasize proximity, accountability, and direct democracy over the diffuse solidarities invoked by the DSA and generations of past socialists.
Public economic reform of a local variety ought to be more fashionable among politicos nowadays than it seems to be. It appeals to the coveted blue-collar rural voter (if Alaska and North Dakota are any indication) as well as to coastal liberals, underscoring a rare point of agreement among Americans across the political spectrum. It also seizes on a burgeoning skepticism toward the traditional mechanisms of power (trust in local government exceeded trust in government generally by a whopping 48 percent in 2014).
As I’ve argued in the past, the tradition of the New Deal affords us a trove of democratic strategies with which to empower reform. But America’s first go at big government was also clunky in certain ways, with its bloated federal bureaucracies and frequent non-compliance by the states. For a second go, we need to reinfuse politics with a feel for the local.
Support for this idea is longstanding. Conventional wisdom going back to Plato has held that a country’s size determines what can or cannot be achieved politically. One common retort to public health care is that America is much larger than, say, Sweden or Norway (both of which provide that service with taxpayer funds). What if instead we re-envisioned the American public services model? Could we work toward fifty Nordic-style systems?
Another example is job training programs. Why does the federal government have an entire agency devoted to organizing these? The division of labor idea suggests that states might more effectively pursue this task, specializing in populations for which they have a better sense and closer contact. I’m not saying cut federal funding — just the federal bureaucrats.
Naturally, I’m skeptical of the “socialist future” advertised around campus. I don’t imagine common-sense reform is their priority, nor am I convinced that justice — whether, as they claim, for separated immigrant families or others — requires class-based organizing.
I agree though that the moment is ripe for new experiments in good government. That’s why I propose gathering around the call for “enlightened administration” from Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904. All (including radicals) are welcome.

While Harvard is very proud that 12 percent of the newly-admitted students this year come from abroad, there is another group of international students many students don’t know about. Each semester, dozens of American and international students enroll at Harvard through the Visiting Undergraduate Student program.
When we received our acceptance letters to the VUS program at Harvard, our first reactions were immediately to be overjoyed. We called our parents and best friends and immediately started thinking about where this next step would take us. One of us imagined that they could finally work with Professor of Economics and Philosophy Amartya Sen, a world-renowned thinker at the intersection of economics and equality.
And we had done so much to get in: three letters of recommendation from important faculty and teachers, an extensive plan of study, exam scores, and more. We’re lucky to say the effort in applying paid off.
Our studies turned out great — we took classes with incredibly motivated students, and our professors asked questions we had never thought about before. However, we did not live the complete Harvard experience. As international students coming from foreign countries, one of our goals at Harvard was to be integrated into the Harvard community as much as College students are. However, this we could not achieve.
The living situation for students in the VUS program is extremely challenging. Some of us live in the DeWolfe housing, where some College students live as well. However, College students in DeWolfe are affiliated with one of the Houses for their social activities. We are affiliated only with Dudley House — the 13th House that does not offer anything close to the experience in the other Houses. One of the biggest aspects of being part of the Harvard undergraduate community is to be affiliated with these Houses. Harvard’s House system offers everyone a family to live with and be part of.
Such an affiliation should be feasible for students in the VUS program. As visiting students, we pay all University fees and tuition in full, and we would just as easily pay for on-campus housing to live in the Houses. Perhaps the College will be unable to offer sufficient housing for all the visiting students. But just some spots, along with an affiliation with the Houses, would go a long way to integrating visiting students.
Harvard should consider the experiences our friends had at MIT or Columbia University. Their universities offered them exactly what we want: an opportunity to stay with degree-seeking students. Before coming to Harvard, we didn’t realize how this would impact our lives. We miss the formals, dinners, and gatherings that are central parts of the Harvard experience.
There are other ways, most importantly in financial aid, that the University disadvantages visiting students. Harvard’s aim to bring a diverse group together should consider socioeconomic diversity. And they do — for degree-seeking students, for whom need-blind admission is offered. Students in the VUS program do not receive any financial aid. This shrinks the pool of students who can enroll to either individuals who can afford such an experience or students with outside scholarships. This tends to attract a certain type of student: Most have good economic standing and come from highly-developed countries. Seldom does one find a student in the program from less developed countries or who received a scholarship to attend Harvard, in our experience.
This, however, is important. The VUS program adds a lot to the layers of diversity found at Harvard. Sudents come from universities with different educational approaches, with different topics taught, from countries with different politics, with different customs and manners. Some students in the VUS program helped College students find internships, study abroad programs, or research contacts abroad. In that way, the VUS program promotes creative solutions and new ideas, the development of which is fostered by such diversity.
Given the range of differences in experiences and viewpoints between students in the College and in the VUS program, the University should take whatever steps it can to integrate the two groups, including through shared orientation or activities.
All of us are grateful to study at this wonderful University, but we VUS program students are denied basic parts of the experience. We lack certificates of program completion, advisors affiliated with our fields of study, and alumni email addresses, and we even have an earlier move-out day than College students.
Now back home, we look back at our time in Harvard as some of the most formative and fascinating months of our lives. While these issues leave a bitter taste, we hope future VUS program generations will be able to have the full Harvard experience and feel as integrated and valuable as their full-time counterparts.
Asusa Sue Iida, Simon I. Döbele, and Michael Gritzbach participated in the Visiting Undergraduate Program.

Harvard Extension School held a convocation for admitted students for the first time in its 108-year history Saturday.
Addressing an audience of 875, the speakers — which included deans, faculty, and alumni — emphasized community and celebrated student achievements.
“My message to you today is simple,” said Robert Neugeboren, dean of students and accessibility at the Division of Continuing Education. “This is your community. You belong here.”
The Extension School, part of the Division of Continuing Education within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, offers part and full-time programs for students of all ages seeking a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or graduate certificate. Out of approximately 2,700 admitted students, more than 400 attended the convocation ceremony in Cambridge, which was also live streamed.
“Our students are global and they’re all around the world, so we are live streaming this event for them,” said Jill N. Felicio, convocation organizer and a DCE administrator.
The brainchild of three Extension School students — Cheniece N. Kelleher, a recent graduate, Payum Noshiravan, and La’Toya P. Jackson — the inaugural convocation was organized after the students won the first-ever Dean’s Community Building Challenge.
“As we’ve grown online, we’ve been focusing on how do we do more to create community amongst the students,” Dean of DCE Huntington D. Lambert said. “The winning proposal was that we start having a convocation where we actually bring all the admitted students together, give them a chance to be here and meet us and meet each other.”
Kelleher, who attended a different institution for her undergraduate degree, said the convocation came from a desire to give students a “full welcome” resembling what she had experienced as an undergraduate.
Although Kelleher graduated last May without experiencing a Harvard convocation herself, she said she was happy to see the student proposal implemented and was excited that other students would have a “strong beginning” at the Extension School.
“It’s nice to have everybody come together at the beginning of the year. You meet new people and set the tone for the year,” Kelleher said. “This is a great step forward.”
Extension School student Rangesh R. Vittal said he would like to see additional events similar to the convocation to help foster a sense of community at the University. The convocation itself, however, exceeded his expectations.
“It was quite inspiring, it wasn’t just people from different countries, it was people from different ages, different backgrounds, different walks of life,” Vittal said. “I met people who are currently working, parents, first-time college-goers in their family.”
Though the students came from many different backgrounds, DCE Dean of Academic Programs Suzanne Spreadbury said they were all part of Harvard's legacy.
“Harvard Extension School has flourished, firmly representing an important part of Harvard’s history, as well as the future of education,” Spreadbury told the audience. “You have become part of Harvard’s history and tradition.”

After months of fine-tuning acoustics and calibrating technology, Klarman Hall — Harvard Business School’s latest construction project — made its debut Monday as a state-of-the-art convening center.
Though the project was completed in June, Klarman Hall celebrated its official opening on Monday. Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 spoke at the dedication ceremony, followed by a symposium on democracy featuring faculty from several of the University’s schools and other leaders in the field.
The project, which broke ground in 2016, replaces Burden Hall, an older conference center strained in capacity by the growing Business School community, said Business School spokesperson Brian C. Kenny.
The project was funded by its namesakes, Seth and Beth Klarman, who also led the dedication ceremony. Seth A. Klarman, who received his MBA from the Business School in 1982, is CEO and portfolio manager of The Baupost Group, an investment management firm. The total cost of the project was $120 million, according to Kenny.
In addition to an auditorium with state-of-the-art technology — including a 32 million pixel screen, the largest of its kind in Boston, according to Kenny — the center boasts recording studios for podcasts and webinars and a black box room for filming for HBX, the online extension school.
In addition to hosting large-scale conferences, Klarman Hall will be used for class events, musical and artistic performances, and smaller “more intimate” discussions, according to Kenny.  This is made possible by a unique architectural design that allows the auditorium to convert into several smaller spaces.
“Harvard Business School and Harvard University more broadly have tremendous convening power,” Kenny said. “To have these kinds of substantive conversations about real issues that are affecting the world...we can have a global conversation out of a facility like this.”
At a panel discussion following the dedication ceremony, former Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow led a faculty discussion on the current state of democracy around the world. Minow was joined by Law School professor Michael Klarman, Government Lecturer Yascha B. Mounk, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, and Bret Stephens, an Op-Ed columnist for the New York Times.

Embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh will not return to teach at Harvard Law School in January, according to an email administrators sent to Law students Monday evening.
“Today, Judge Kavanaugh indicated that he can no longer commit to teaching his course in January Term 2019, so the course will not be offered,” Associate Dean and Dean for Academic and Faculty Affairs Catherine Claypoole wrote in the email, which she sent on behalf of the Law School's Curriculum Committee.
A Harvard Law School spokesperson confirmed late Monday night that Kavanaugh will not teach his course, titled “The Supreme Court Since 2005” and slated to last for three weeks. Kavanaugh has taught at the Law School for roughly a decade.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening.
The D.C. appellate court judge became a household name over the summer when President Donald Trump nominated him in July to fill the vacant seat left by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the nation’s highest court seemed all but certain until several women stepped forward over the past two weeks to allege he had sexually assaulted them or others decades ago.
Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford was the first woman to go public with her story, alleging in a Sept. 16 article published by the Washington Post that the judge tried to rape her when both attended a house party in 1982 in suburban Maryland. Ford said that Kavanaugh pushed her onto a bed, sought to remove her clothes, and ground his body into hers. She restated these allegations in vivid detail last Thursday when she testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in a nationally televised hearing that riveted the country and divided legislators.
Soon after Ford’s interview with the Post, a second woman — Deborah Ramirez — came forward with her own set of allegations, stating in an interview with the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had shoved his penis in her face at a party when both were freshmen at Yale College. A third woman, Julie Swetnick, later issued a sworn statement asserting that she saw Kavanaugh engage in “inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s.”
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied all of these allegations. During Thursday’s hearing, he angrily insisted that the women’s tales of sexual assault formed part of a Democratic plot to derail his nomination.
The showdown over Kavanaugh has roiled the campus where he spent ten years instructing Harvard Law students on issues such as the separation of powers and the Court on which he hopes to serve. Though Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 has remained largely silent throughout the controversy, Law students and alumni — as well as Harvard undergraduates — have been outspoken in their desire to see Kavanaugh investigated and possibly barred from teaching in Cambridge.
A few days before Claypoole announced Kavanaugh’s decision to sever ties with Harvard Law School, hundreds of school alumni signed a letter to Manning urging him to “rescind” Kavanaugh’s position as a lecturer and to forbid the judge from teaching this winter. The alumni had not sent the letter to Manning as of Monday evening, though it is available online.
“We believe that Judge Kavanaugh’s appointment as an HLS lecturer sends a message to law students, and in particular female students, that powerful men are above the law, and that obstructive, inappropriate behavior will be rewarded,” the letter states. “Judge Kavanaugh is not leadership material, and he is not lectureship material. HLS would be tarnished to have him on campus in any position of authority.”
“We ask that you rescind his lectureship,” the letter continues.
As of Monday at noon, the document had garnered over 700 signatures — some from alumni who graduated as early as 1959. Lauren Birchfield Kennedy, who works in health care policy and is the wife of Rep. Joseph Kennedy III (D-Mass.), co-authored the letter.
Current Law School students have also put pen to paper to voice their displeasure over Kavanaugh’s teaching role. Enrollees in at least six of seven first-year Law student “sections” — class sub-groups comprising roughly 80 students each — organized and sent separate letters to Manning over the weekend.
Every single letter asked Manning to launch a Harvard-led investigation into the sexual assault allegations levied against Kavanaugh. The F.B.I. opened its own probe into the accusations last week. The Bureau is slated to produce a report on Kavanaugh some time in the next few days, after which the Senate plans to take a final vote on the nominee.
Contacted multiple times over the past week, Harvard Law spokespeople repeatedly refused to say whether the school has launched its own investigation into Kavanaugh or whether it plans to do so.
Some of the letters sent to Manning over the weekend stated that Law School students — especially those who have suffered sexual assault or harassment — would be made uncomfortable by Kavanaugh’s presence on campus. Close to 300 first-year students signed the six letters.
“Allowing a person credibly accused of sexual assault to teach students prior to a full investigation surely creates a hostile environment for many students, and especially survivors,” students wrote in one letter.
Enrollees in at least one section also penned letters to Law School professors. In these missives, students asked their teachers to contact administrators on their behalf to request that Law School officials “reassure students that Judge Kavanaugh will not be allowed to teach a class at Harvard until there has been a full investigation into the allegations of sexual assault he now faces.”
Alexa R. Richardson, the head organizer of the section that sent these letters, wrote in an email Monday that she and other section members received responses from most of the professors contacted.
The professors replied “saying they passed on our concerns to the administration,” Richardson wrote. Some instructors noted that “they were moved/thanked us for our efforts,” she added.
The spate of student letters also criticized administrators for failing to offer a public statement acknowledging the existence of sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.
“The administration's silence diminishes students’ trust that HLS will hold its faculty accountable for wrongdoing,” one letter read.
When Trump first announced Kavanaugh’s nomination over the summer, Manning lauded the conservative judge and Yale Law School graduate, writing in a post on a Harvard website that Kavanaugh was “an inspiring teacher and mentor.”
But Manning remained quiet regarding Ford, Ramirez, and Swetnick’s allegations of misconduct — even as students turned up the pressure by mounting a series of escalating protests against Kavanaugh.
First, four Law students involved with student advocacy group the Pipeline Parity Project published an op-ed in the Harvard Law Record calling on the school to bar the conservative judge from teaching pending a “full and fair investigation” into the women’s allegations. Following the op-ed, Law students staged a rally last Monday that saw hundreds of students across the University walk out of class to stand in solidarity with Ford and Ramirez. And during the tense and high-stakes Kavanaugh-Ford hearings Thursday, students staged further protests, stepping outside during a break in the proceedings to pose for pictures and hoist anti-Kavanaugh posters.
Some Law students cheered when the nominee lamented during his testimony that accusations of sexual misconduct might prevent him from returning to teach at Harvard.
As the days of turmoil stretched on, Law School spokespeople said the Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells supported students’ activism but responded to questions regarding Kavanaugh’s employment status by noting that they could not comment on “personnel matters.” Manning refused to comment entirely.
On Friday, the Law School dean finally broke his silence. Sort of.
He wrote in an email to Law students that he understood some on campus were “unsatisfied with the answer that we cannot comment on personnel matters in particular cases.” He argued that “the policy serves important purposes even in stressful times.”
“Still, I can provide you this assurance:  When concerns and allegations arise about individuals in our teaching program, we take those concerns and allegations seriously, conduct necessary inquiries, complete our process, and then act,” he wrote in the email.
Yale Law School Dean Heather K. Gerken, by contrast, has been much more outspoken than her Harvard counterpart. She joined the American Bar Association in calling for “an additional investigation into allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh” in a statement posted on a Yale website Friday.
As of Monday evening, Kavanaugh’s profile appeared to have been scrubbed from the Law School’s public faculty directory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An “extreme risk protection order” firearms bill inspired by recent Harvard alumnus Reed T. Shafer-Ray ’18  — allowing family members, housemates, and law enforcement officials to file temporary firearms restrictions in civil court — is now Massachusetts law.
Driven by the suicide of a childhood friend, Shafer-Ray contacted Massachusetts Rep. Marjorie C. Decker in 2016 to share his ideas for improving gun safety in Massachusetts. They first met in fall 2016; soon after, Decker’s office drafted versions of two bills, H.3610 and H.3611 — the former of which was later renamed H.4670.
In July, H.4670 went into immediate effect as Massachusetts law. H.3611, a counterpart bill allowing Massachusetts residents to voluntarily put themselves on a firearms “no-sell” list, is stalled in the Massachusetts House Ways and Means Committee.
Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 signed H.4670 — “An act relative to firearms” — on July 3. Once petitioners file to limit an individual’s access to firearms, a judge considers the petition within a court day and determines whether there is reasonable cause to believe the person “poses a significant danger” of injury to themselves or others.
If the judge sides with the petitioner, a temporary protection order prohibits the individual’s access to any firearms for two weeks. A full court hearing then allows the presentation of “credible evidence,” which may bar firearm access for up to one year.
Shafer-Ray said he first received news of the bill’s passage while he was driving.
“When it all sunk in while I was driving, I just burst into tears, and I think it was the first time I had cried in — I don't really know when the last time I cried was,” he said. “It was truly one of the most powerful moments for me, just the sense that something I was part of had come to fruition in a way that I knew was going to truly help other people.”
Decker wrote in an email that Shafer-Ray was a critical force in the inception and passage of the bill.
“I filed the ERPO bill as a direct result of meeting with Harvard Dems and Reed’s personal  commitment to ensuring that we enact safer common sense gun laws that have been shown to save lives,” she wrote. “I am thankful to Reed not only for his support and commitment to the the ERPO law, but as an individual who made an effort to get to know his State Representative.”
Mass. Senator Michael O. Moore, who chairs the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security that reviewed the bills, said he supported its aims.
“I think if you look at the tragedies that have occurred across the country, and you look at the content of these bills and what they’re trying to accomplish, they make sense,” he said. “It protects right to access and Second Amendment rights, but also balances with our need to preserve people’s public safety.”
Shafer-Ray said various groups also worked to advocate for the bill, including Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Stop Handgun Violence, two organizations that lobby for gun violence prevention.
John E. Rosenthal, the president of Stop Handgun Violence, said he believes the law will save lives from preventable gun violence.
“It's just common sense for family members who know their relations the best to be able to petition a court to remove a gun if the person is a risk to themselves or others,” he said.
Rosenthal said that his advocacy for the bill included speaking with House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo and introducing him to people affected personally by gun violence.
“I have a close relationship with the House Speaker, and I was very involved with getting him to move on this bill,” Rosenthal said. “I introduced him to students from Parkland and other areas from the country where mass shootings have happened, and largely by people who were known, either to the authorities, and certainly known to have problems by their families.”
DeLeo credited conversations with students — “including activists at Harvard” — as fundamental in driving gun control measures in the state legislature. He wrote in an email that the ERPO bill as well as a recent ban on bump stocks enhanced the state’s “already toughest in the nation gun laws.”
Molly H. Malloy, the Massachusetts chapter leader of Moms Demand Action, said the group pushed for the bill by visiting the statehouse, calling legislators, and writing letters to the editors of various publications.
“We are extremely pleased that it passed, and we really felt that lawmakers took into account the wishes of the citizens of Massachusetts, so that people could be safer and guns could be out of the hands of people who are in crisis,” she said.
Given that the Senate has now moved into informal session, Moore said that H.3611, the voluntary do-not-sell list bill, is unlikely to be reconsidered until the spring of 2019.
“I don’t think you realistically would see any further movement on that bill until it’s refiled next year,” Moore said. “There won’t be any sort of hearing on legislation probably until maybe March.”
Shafer-Ray said he believes the bill was tabled because the idea that someone would voluntarily disavow themselves of a firearm is a new concept for many people.
“I think this is a really groundbreaking and innovative solution for a lot of the gun-related deaths we're seeing in the country,” he said. “I think [it] will need some time to be understood.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a few months into his tenure, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has a simple message for Harvard hopefuls: don’t apply if you’re not comfortable with the College’s social group penalties.
The sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships.
In his first full-length interview with The Crimson last week, Bacow said the policy reflects the College’s values of inclusion and belonging and that prospective students should “embrace” those principles before deciding to attend Harvard.
“Nobody puts a gun to anybody’s head and says that they have to come here,” Bacow said. “These are really important issues for students. If they don’t like the way we do things, there are other places which they can go to school that have adopted a different approach, but we’ve tried to be explicit about what we care about, what our values are, who we are.”
For Bacow, the sanctions are specifically intended to promote gender inclusivity.
“We want every student that comes to Harvard to feel welcome and included,” he said. “We don’t want students by virtue of their gender to feel like they are not part of the institution more broadly.”
Gender, though, has not always been the rationale Harvard administrators have relied on to make the case for the social group penalties. When former University President Drew G. Faust first announced the controversial policy in spring 2016, she said the penalties aimed to reduce sexual assault. Since then, administrators have pivoted to gender-based inclusivity as a justification, then diversity of all stripes.
Despite administrators’ pivot to gender as a rationale, the sanctions have taken a disproportionate toll on all-female social groups. All 10 formerly all-female groups applied for and received official College recognition in September, in exchange for vowing to go gender-neutral.
In contrast, some all-male final clubs have resisted the sanctions and refused to go co-ed. The Cambridge Coalition — a group comprising the Fly Club, the Porcellian Club, and the AD Club, and the national organizations of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternities — has traveled to the nation’s capital to lobby Congress to pass a law that could imperil Harvard’s social group policy.
Bacow said students in organizations are “responding in their own way” to the sanctions. He added that, in his first months on the job, he is still examining how the policy is playing out.
“I’m still, as a new president, getting to know and understand sort of the impact of our policies and how it’s affecting folks,” he said.
This isn’t Bacow’s first encounter with Harvard’s social group policy; before taking office in July, he served as a member the Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — when the group voted in Dec. 2017 to keep the sanctions once and for all, ending more than a year of uncertainty surrounding the policy’s future.
Bacow said he thinks it is important to highlight what the College has “not done,” which is to bar students from joining single-gender social organizations entirely. He referred to similar, but not identical policies at Amherst College, Bowdoin College, and Williams College that effectively banned the existence of single-gender social groups on their campuses.
“We haven’t said to students they cannot belong to these organizations. They can,” Bacow said. “We’ve said you decide, but there are consequences to those decisions.”
Bacow said the College, in that respect, has attempted to give students flexibility in how they construct their social lives at Harvard.
“If you want to hold yourself out as being the best that Harvard has to offer, we have expectations that you would live up to the ideals of inclusion and belonging that are embraced by the University,” he said.
The landscape of Harvard social groups will likely evolve in the years to come, Bacow predicted. In examining the impact of the policy, Bacow said he will see “how it all sorts out.”
“I suspect that it wouldn’t surprise me if things look different a year, two years, three years from now then they look now. I don’t think we’ve reached equilibrium yet,” he said. “But we’ll see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard alumni from across the University are banding together to call on fellow Harvard graduates in the Senate to vote against Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation to the Supreme Court.
Alumni have circulated at least two separate letters in recent days — one addressed to the 13 Harvard alumni who currently serve in the Senate, and one specifically to Sen. Ben Sasse ’94 (R-Neb.) from his College classmates.
Two women have accused Kavanaugh — who President Donald Trump nominated to the country’s highest court over the summer — of sexual assault. The FBI is now pursuing a week-long investigation into the allegations before the Senate proceeds with a vote.
The letter to Sasse, which was posted to Change.org Sept. 27, had gathered more than 250 signatures as of Monday evening. The open letter to the 13 senators, hosted on a Google document, had garnered almost more than 250 signatures as of Monday evening.
The petition to Sasse was primarily circulated through the Class of 1994 alumni Facebook group, though organizer Aren R. Cohen ’94 said she and others also distributed the petition via emails and direct messages to alumni.
The text of the petition points to Sasse’s 2017 book, “The Vanishing American Adult,” which argues that young Americans are ill-equipped to face the demands of the global economy — and puts forward a vision for raising active and engaged citizens.
“Rather than being ‘a coward or a weakling, a bully, a shirk, or a prig,’ as an elected official, we urge you to demonstrate the bravery and commitment to the American democratic principles you have so often celebrated on the Senate Judiciary Committee by citing ‘Schoolhouse Rock’ civics,” the letter reads, quoting from the book.
Cohen said she hopes that Sasse “can be a part of the solution, not the problem.”
Cohen added in an email, “The Class of ’94 were students together. Now we're the grown-ups in the room. Senator Sasse is concerned about the state of adulthood in America, so I thought the Class of 1994 could encourage him to be an adult and a patriot since this political environment looks more and more like a children's sandbox.”
Sasse’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Beth A. Johnston ’93, who penned the letter to the 13 Harvard alumni in the Senate, said “Veritas” — Harvard’s motto — was a driving theme in their message to the legislators.
“Obviously when we’re trying to make a direct connection in terms of Harvard, we immediately thought of ‘Veritas’ and the question of the fact that we did not feel that Judge Kavanaugh had been as truthful or as forthcoming as he could have been in his hearing with the senators,” she said.
That letter, dated Sept. 30, bears signatures from a number of Harvard classes and schools, with the College Class of 1993 comprising a majority as of Monday evening.
The letter charges that Kavanaugh was “evasive and misleading in much of his testimony to the US Senate about a range of issues” during an explosive hearing Thursday. It urges those who have not already opposed Kavanaugh’s placement on the court to do so.
“Other candidates unquestionably exist who can be both more forthcoming and more balanced,” the letter reads.
The alumni letters come as students on Harvard’s campus have organized in recent weeks to bar Kavanaugh from teaching at the Law School, as he has as a visiting lecturer since 2008.
Harvard Law School informed students Monday evening that Kavanaugh will not return to teach in January 2019.

Economics Professor Gita Gopinath was appointed chief economist of the International Monetary Fund on Friday and will become the first woman to hold the position when she begins her two year term in January.
Gopinath said the appointment, announced by the IMF Monday morning, is “very exciting.”
“Stepping out there and engaging with policy makers when their countries are either going into crises or you have to make important policy decisions,” Gopinath said, “that’s an experience that’s hard to replicate just sitting in my office at Harvard.”
Gopinath first came to Harvard as an assistant professor in 2005 and received tenure from the Economics Department in 2010. She has since served as an economic adviser to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and co-editor of the American Economic Review. In 2014, the IMF named Gopinath one of the top 25 economists under age 45.
She will now take a two-year leave from Harvard to serve the IMF, an international organization of 189 countries working to encourage economic growth and facilitate trade across the world. In the chief economist role, Gopinath will lead a team of more than 1000 researchers while also serving as the most influential policy adviser to the managing director of the IMF.
“This is a spectacular appointment,” said Economics Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff, who has worked closely with Gopinath in various capacities since 1996, when he served as her dissertation adviser at Princeton University. “They couldn’t have picked anyone better.”
The IMF’s current chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, a professor at University of California, Berkeley, described the role as one of the most influential positions an economist can hold. He also noted that Gopinath will serve as editor of the biannual “World Economic Outlook,” which Rogoff called “by far the most cited” indicator of the global economy’s health.
Rogoff — who himself served as IMF chief economist from 2001–2003 — called Gopinath “absolutely one of the couple most influential researchers of the past decade.”
“Her most influential work shows the ever-rising role of the dollar in the global financial system,” Rogoff said. He and Mohamed A. El-Erian, who served as CEO of the Harvard Management Company from 2005–2007, both noted that Gopinath’s work has challenged “conventional wisdom.”
In particular, Rogoff noted Gopinath’s research on flexible exchange rates, which has indicated that their benefits are less significant than the IMF previously thought.
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde announced today that global economic prospects may be dimmer than previously thought, and warned that the impacts of a trade war could be “devastating.”
Gopinath agreed in an interview, citing the recent rise in oil prices, the trade tensions incited by tariffs, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates as possible causes of an economic downturn.
Jeremy C. Stein, Economics Department chair, said Gopinath’s temporary departure will be a “loss” for the department, but that she will bring invaluable experience to her new role.
“She’s terrific and she’s going to be great in this job. She’s clearly one of the best international economists in the world,” Stein said. “So, we’ll miss her. That’s going to be a hard thing to make up for with a visitor.”

Former President Barack Obama endorsed Mass. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jay Gonzalez Monday, as Gonzalez prepares to face popular Republican incumbent Charlie D. Baker ’79 at the polls in November.
The move came as part of a string of endorsements released by the former president via Twitter, which included his support for Ayanna S. Pressley, the Democratic nominee in Massachusetts’s 7th Congressional District who scored a stunning primary upset last month.
“Jay Gonzalez is a bold leader who has the vision, the experience and the heart to be an outstanding Governor for the people of Massachusetts. I am proud to support his candidacy,” Obama, a Harvard Law School graduate, said in a statement released by Gonzalez’s office. “He has the leadership experience to deliver on an ambitious agenda, including a transportation system that people can rely on and an education system that gives every child the high-quality public education they deserve.”
Though Obama did not comment on this policy in particular, Gonzalez’s “ambitious agenda” on education reform includes an endowment tax proposal that would cost Harvard an estimated $550 million per year.
The former president's endorsement, which also praised lieutenant gubernatorial candidate Quentin A. Palfrey ’96, follows a Sept. 19 press conference held by Gonzalez at the Harvard T station, where he announced his proposal to levy a 1.6 percent tax on private, non-profit colleges and universities in Massachusetts whose endowments total $1 billion or more.
Harvard would qualify for the tax, in addition to four of its fellow research institutions — MIT, Tufts, Boston University, and Boston College — as well as four small liberal arts colleges – Wellesley, Amherst, Williams, and Smith.
Harvard officials declined to comment on the endorsement, but previously noted that if Gonzalez’s endowment tax had taken effect in fiscal year 2017, it would have cost Harvard over $500 million.
The university is currently facing an estimated $43 million in federal taxes this fiscal year after the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in Congress last December.
Baker, as well as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Michael E. Capuano, have criticized Gonzalez’s endowment tax proposal since its annoucement. Baker compared it to the Republican-led tax bill.
“I start with the proposition that when President Trump proposed this idea, I thought it was a bad idea then, and I still think it's a bad idea,” Baker said, according to the Boston Globe two weeks ago.
Gonzalez said in the statement that he was "honored" to receive the former president’s endorsement.
“I am so honored to receive the endorsement of a United States President as inspirational and as accomplished as President Obama,” he said. “President Obama’s approach to public service ought to serve as a model for political leaders everywhere, and I hope to have the honor of following his example as Governor.”
Palfrey, a Harvard alum who is the son of Adams House faculty deans John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and Judith “Judy” S. Palfrey ’67, previously served in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during Obama's first term.
“It was the honor of a lifetime to serve in President Obama’s administration," Palfrey said in the statement. “As President, he made sure his administration put people first, and as Governor and Lieutenant Governor Jay and I promise to do the same.”

Current and former top Harvard administrators — including former University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith — will testify in the University's upcoming admissions trial, according to Monday court filings.
Lawyers for Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions — the plaintiff in the ongoing lawsuit, which alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants in the College’s admissions process — published separate lists of witnesses they “will” or “may” call to testify.
The witness lists include the names of several other administrators, including Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, former Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue, and Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, along with multiple other admissions officers.
These Harvard figureheads will have to answer questions about how race is considered as part of the University’s “holistic” admissions process.
Current Harvard administrators who recently took their posts, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine D. Gay, did not appear on either of the witness lists.
Another absence from both lists is Edward Blum, the president of SFFA. In a previous petition to the judge, SFFA argued that “he has no relevant information to offer at this trial.”
Both Harvard and SFFA told the court they would call School of Public Health Dean for Education Erin Driver-Linn. Beginning in 2008, Driver-Linn previously directed the work of Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research, which in 2013 produced an internal, preliminary report which found the College’s admissions process produces “negative effects” for Asian-American applicants.
Harvard and SFFA will also call their expert witnesses, Berkeley Economics Professor David Card and Duke Economics Professor Peter S. Arcidiacono, respectively. Both experts produced commissioned statistical reports which came to opposite conclusions over whether racial differences in applicants’ personal scores were the product of systematic discrimination.
The administrators and expert witnesses will appear throughout a trial at the U.S. District Courthouse in Boston beginning Oct. 15. Harvard and SFFA may call these witnesses throughout the duration of trial, which will last three weeks.
The lawsuit has picked up steam steam since it was first brought by anti-affirmative action organization SFFA in 2014. Experts say that regardless of the conclusion of the case at the trial level, the decision is likely to be appealed until it reaches the level of the Supreme Court — a development that could decide the fate of affirmative action in higher education.
SFFA is not alone in threatening Harvard’s admissions policies; the Department of Justice is independently conducting an ongoing probe into discrimination allegations and in August filed a “statement of interest” in the lawsuit saying the College’s admissions process is “infected with racial bias.”
The submission of the witness lists comes in advance of a Wednesday hearing in which the attorneys will meet in front of Judge Allison D. Burroughs to discuss logistics of the trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a dozen undergraduates ventured to Grays Hall on a rainy Monday evening to enjoy chocolate-chip cookies, recline in beanbag chairs, and engage in conversation about Harvard's admissions controversy.
Diversity Peer Educators — students employed by the College’s Office of Diversity Education and Support — facilitated the Monday discussion, which is part of the office’s fall “Diversity Dialogue Series.”
After an ice-breaker activity, the student facilitators asked students to reflect on the words “diversity,” “merit-based admissions,” “racial discrimination,” and “model minority.” Attendees wrote their thoughts on colored notes and placed them on posters around the room.
The conversation began with an overview of the history and legal background of the lawsuit pending against the University over allegations that the College discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its admissions process.
Organizers distributed copies of a “fact sheet” that provided Harvard’s perspective on its “holistic” admissions process. It also referred students to a University informational website about the suit, as well as to the webpage for Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action organization suing the University.
Some of the discussion centered around how the case is being discussed throughout the student body. Some students expressed concerns that their peers are uninformed about the case, while others voiced criticism of media coverage of the suit.
“I think it definitely makes you realize that there are so many more people who are being affected by it. This topic is not spoken much about. People aren’t discussing as much about this conversation in my immediate surroundings,” Jane Li ’22 said after the event.
When discussing recent developments in the lawsuit, some students highlighted the June revelation that a 2013 internal report conducted by University researchers found that Asian Americans suffer “negative effects” in the admissions process. Harvard administrators have disputed the conclusions, calling them “incomplete.”
Many attendees said, though they were concerned about allegations of systematic bias, they were also hesitant to conflate affirmative action with discrimination.
Several students said they believed components of the college admissions process — like the personal essay, teacher recommendations, and standardized test scores — are inherently discriminatory and provide an advantage to students of certain socioeconomic backgrounds.
Students discussed their personal experiences of the admissions process in the context of their racial identities.
About 20 students — including DPE organizers and representatives from the Harvard Foundation, the Harvard Black Students Association, the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies, and the Harvard South Asian Association — attended the event, which had been advertised over student email lists and on dining hall table-tops.
Before closing, facilitators extended an invitation to future discussions about the admissions lawsuit that will be held by several of the racial affinity groups represented at the event.
Samantha G. Um ’21 said she appreciated the conversation because of the opportunity it provided to engage students from different backgrounds in dialogue surrounding the controversy.
“I think it’s really important for us to have this discussion because there aren’t many events that have happened that foster racial dialogue between different racial groups, so I think that’s one of most important things looking forward in this lawsuit,” Um said after the event.
Other students have hosted events to share information about the admissions lawsuit and affirmative action at Harvard. TAPAS held a series of performances in the Yard in September to highlight a public exhibit on the history of affirmative action.
Some students have chosen to take even more direct involvement in the suit. Twenty-five student and alumni organizations filed an amicus brief in support of the College’s admissions policies. A number of representatives from these student organizations have even petitioned to testify when the case goes the trial.
The trial for the case will begin on Oct. 15 at the U.S. District Courthouse in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days before Harvard Law School announced embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh will not teach in Cambridge this January, undergraduates eager to block his return to campus struck on a new strategy: file Title IX complaints against the conservative judge.
Over the past week, several students filed formal complaints alleging Kavanaugh’s presence in Cambridge would violate Harvard’s policy prohibiting sexual and gender-based harassment — though several Title IX experts said this strategy was unlikely to succeed.
Jacqueline L. Kellogg ’19 — who said she has filed a complaint against Kavanaugh with the University’s Office for Dispute Resolution — came up with the idea several days ago. She began urging fellow students to follow suit over the weekend, at one point sending an email to a group of students at the College and the Law School that offered specific instructions on how to bring a formal complaint to ODR.
By the time The Crimson reported late Monday that Kavanaugh had left his teaching position at the Law School, at least 48 students had signed an online petition certifying they had filed a Title IX complaint against the nominee. But at least one signatory said that not all of those who signed the petition had actually filed complaints as of Monday evening.
The flurry of complaints comes as Kavanaugh — a Yale Law School graduate who has long served as a D.C. circuit court judge — awaits a Senate confirmation vote delayed by a week-long FBI investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted at least two women decades ago. Kavanaugh became a household name when President Donald Trump nominated him to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court in July.
At first, the judge’s confirmation seemed all but certain. But it didn’t last.
First, Christine Blasey Ford told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh had tried to rape her at a house party the two attended in suburban Maryland in the 1980s. Days later, Deborah Ramirez told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh had pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while students at Yale.
Last Wednesday, Julie Swetnick said in a sworn affidavit that Kavanaugh was present while a group of teenage boys drugged and raped her at a D.C.-area party in 1982.
The cascade of accusations prompted some Law School students to protest Kavanaugh’s confirmation and to demand Harvard investigate the allegations against the nominee before allowing him to return to campus to teach a course on the Supreme Court in Jan. 2019. Kavanaugh has taught at the Law School since 2008.
Kellogg’s email to students included an explanation of ODR’s operating procedures and encouraged recipients to reference Harvard’s policies barring gender-based harassment. The University defines gender-based harassment as “verbal, nonverbal, graphic, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostile conduct based on sex, sex-stereotyping, sexual orientation or gender identity.”
Kellogg and Julia B. Wiener ’19 — who also signed the petition and filed a complaint against Kavanaugh — both argued the nominee’s presence on campus would create a “hostile environment” as defined in Harvard guidelines related to sexual harassment.
Kellogg said she hopes students who have previously felt reluctant to file complaints with the University — whether related to Kavanaugh or to other experiences — will see that the formal process gives them “power” and “a right to our feeling of being safe.”
“I hope that, as students file these complaints and engage with this process of singling out accusers and harassers on campus, that it actually can be seen that this process is a little less formidable than the reputation of the process is on campus,” she said.
Kellogg and Wiener said they believe students who have suffered sexual assault or harassment would have been negatively affected had they encountered Kavanaugh around campus.
“If you had a meeting in Wasserstein, you don’t know if he’s going to be there,” Wiener said. “It would be pretty terrifying for any survivor or any person to walk into a building on campus and see someone who has been alleged of a very serious crime.”
William D. McCants, the director of ODR, declined to comment via a spokesperson. The University typically does not comment on the existence or status of Title IX investigations.
Some Harvard Law School professors were not sold on Kellogg and Wiener’s tactics.
Jeannie Suk Gersen, a professor at the Law School and a Title IX expert who has written extensively about Kavanaugh’s confirmation, said that — while she supports the students’ freedom to protest the nominee’s former teaching role at Harvard — the notion of filing Title IX complaints is “misplaced.”
“Such an abuse of process would undermine the legitimacy and credibility of complaints that the Title IX process is intended to deal with, as well as of the Title IX office to focus on its duties,” Suk Gersen wrote in an email. “It might be effective in drawing further attention to some students’ objection to Kavanaugh’s teaching appointment, but I don’t expect him to be found to have violated Harvard University’s Sexual & Gender-Based Harassment Policy based on the currently known public allegations against him.”
Janet Halley, another Law School professor with a background in Title IX law, also called the students’ strategy of filing formal complaints unlikely to succeed.
“I urge the students to divert their energy from this implausible claim that he’s going to create a sexually hostile environment by teaching at the Law School to the really grand issue of whether he’s fit to be in his current judgeship or promoted to the Supreme Court,” Halley said.
Had Kavanaugh not chosen to leave the Law School, administrators would have been forced to review students’ complaints under the school’s Title IX procedures. It is unclear what will become of the complaints now that the nominee has severed his ties to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After helping bring the Harvard men’s hockey program back under the national spotlight, Jimmy Vesey ’16 has cemented himself as a nightly regular in the New York Rangers lineup.
This past season — his second full campaign in the National Hockey League — Vesey played in 79 of 82 games and logged 17 goals, good for fifth-most on the team. He added 11 helpers that season. As a rookie, the 2015-2016 Hobey Baker Award winner skated in 80 contests, in which he tallied 27 points and even got his first taste of playoff hockey by helping the Rangers advance to the second round.
As he prepares for the fast-approaching NHL season, Vesey will look to ascend the forward ranks on a Rangers team that found itself playing the role of seller at the trade deadline last season. With fewer stars clogging up the top spots, Vesey will be in the mix for a more prominent role on a comparatively younger roster.
Vesey comes from a hockey family. His father, Jim, played hockey at Merrimack College and played 15 games in the NHL with the St. Louis Blues and the Boston Bruins. Jim currently works as a scout for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Additionally, Jimmy’s younger brother, Nolan, signed with the Edmonton Oilers this summer.
Vesey’s contributions to the Harvard program cannot be overstated. His promise was evident early on: Vesey received Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors after his freshman campaign, a foreshadowing of his eventual domination of the ECAC. To cap his final two collegiate seasons, Vesey pocketed back-to-back conference Player of the Year awards.
Most notably, Vesey took home college hockey’s most prestigious accolade, the Hobey Baker Award, after foregoing the opportunity to depart the NCAA for the NHL a year before graduation. The North Reading, Mass., native was just the fourth Harvard skater to achieve such a feat.
During his four years in Cambridge, Vesey racked up 144 points (80–64—144), good for 12th in program history and tied exactly with Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91. The former Harvard standout sits fifth all-time in career goals for the school.
Vesey was selected in the third round of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators. Ultimately, he avoided any obligations to the Nashville franchise — or to the Buffalo Sabres, who traded for his rights in the summer of 2016 — waiting to sign with a team after four full college seasons. With more leverage in negotiations as an unrestricted free agent, Vesey chose the Rangers in August after graduation.
As a member of Manhattan’s storied hockey club, Vesey has continued to perform at a high level. He was awarded the Lars-Erik Sjöberg award, which is given to the best rookie in training camp, in 2016. His other NHL feats include nabbing a hat trick on March 12 of this past season and scoring two goals in just 29 seconds in a November contest, marking the fastest two goals scored by a Ranger in over a decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team demonstrated its dominance in the three-day Bulldog Invitational at Yale over the weekend. Freshman Rachel Lim, freshman Rachel Eason, freshman Chelsea Williams, freshman Annika Bassey, sophomore Neha Gupta, sophomore Anna Li, junior Lexi Milunovich, and junior Natasha Gonzalez competed in the weekend's tournament against Dartmouth (Sunday), Boston College (Saturday), and Cornell (Friday). The team steamrolled over all of its opponents on the weekend, winning all matches as a team.
The tournament serves as an early opportunity for the team to play strong teams in the offseason. Natasha Gonzalez emphasized how awesome it was to see all of the freshmen performing at high levels and keeping up the intensity.
“It was really great to see all of our freshmen out there,” said Gonzalez. “They played really well.”
Sunday’s record proved to be the worst of the weekend, yet the Crimson still managed to be too much to handle for the Big Green. Harvard won three singles matches and two doubles matches and lost two singles matches and one doubles match against Dartmouth. After losing the first set 6-3, Anna Li refused to back down, and was able to capture the second set 6-3. Once the playing field was even, Li took control and the win, defeating freshman Jingyi Peng in the third set, 6-3. Neha Gupta fought all the way to a seven-point tiebreaker in the first set of her match, and came in clutch with a 7-3 win. Carrying that momentum into the second set, Gupta was able to secure the match in straight sets, defeating senior Madison Hwang. Li and Gupta then joined forces in a doubles match where they demolished the Big Green 6-0.
“It’s always fun to play other Ivies because we know it’s going to be a battle,” said Lexi Milunovich.  “The competition is really good.”
Singles victories also came from freshman Rachel Eason and Lexi Milunovich, both of whom won in straight sets. Rachel Lim fell to senior Abigail Chiu in her singles match, but bounced back and forced Dartmouth to roll the bagel in her doubles match with partner, Chelsea Williams.
The Harvard-Boston College match was similar: Crimson 8, Eagles 2. Singles won six out of the seven courts and doubles took two out of three courts. Three matches included a seven-point tiebreaker. Eason and Lim both won their first sets seemingly easily, but both second sets proved to be a bigger challenge, ending in tiebreakers. However, both were able to get the win, edging their opponents with identical tiebreak scores, 8-6. Gonzalez lost a tight first set to freshman Laura Lopez, 4-6, but had the intense mental strength to bring the second set to a tiebreaker. Lopez was able to seal the win, however, beating Gonzalez with a tiebreak score of 8-6.  In last year’s invitational, Boston College earned a strong 6-1 victory over H, but clearly the tables have turned.
The first match of the tournament was against Cornell, and Harvard was fired up. The Crimson came out of the gates firing on all cylinders.
“We just had a really solid day all around,” said Lexi Milunovich. “We won 6/6 singles so we had a clean sweep and 2/3 doubles, which was really good for us.”
The competition was not strong enough to defeat Milunovich, however, as she defeated the Big Red Maria Adiaconitei, 7-6(4), 6-1. Milunovich claimed a huge shift in momentum for her was winning the tiebreak in the first set. Clearly she entered the second set with all of the momentum, and it never shifted again.
For the team as a whole, Gonzalez believed it was the Cornell match that set them up for success for the weekend.
“We came out strong and earned the doubles points and then the singles matches we were down on a lot of courts, but the team stayed really mentally strong and then we fought really well and ended up winning [almost] every single match against Cornell,” said Gonzalez. “It [was] also the first match of the weekend so that was really impressive to start strong like right off the bat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Jillian Wachira’s first career goal could hardly have come at a better time. In a tense, low-scoring game against a strong Yale team, her 29th minute game-winning strike was just enough to ensure victory for Harvard women’s soccer.
The Crimson (4-4-1, 1-0-1 Ivy League) started its three game homestand in style by handing Yale (5-4-1, 0-2-0 Ivy League) its second consecutive loss and bringing their overall record up to .500. Both teams came to Jordan Field determined to come away with a win, and both teams looked capable of emerging victorious throughout the full ninety minutes. Ultimately, however, the combination of Harvard’s stout defending and Wachira’s moment of individual offensive brilliance proved too much for the Bulldogs to handle.
Each team started the game aggressively and forced both keepers to make impressive saves in order to keep the game scoreless. A diving save from Yale’s keeper to deny Murphy Agnew in the 18th minute kept the Crimson off the scoreboard. Finally, 28 minutes into the first half, Jillian Wachira broke the deadlock with a stunning strike from the edge of the 18 yard box.
The freshman defender Wachira made an overlapping run down the left flank, picked up the ball in the midfield from classmate Lara Schenk, and beat two Bulldog defenders before finessing a shot past Yale’s keeper into the top corner at the far post. This goal, the first of her career, would prove the only difference between the two closely matched sides.
Wachira’s contributions were not limited to the attacking end of the pitch, either. Having appeared in all nine games that the Crimson has played so far this season, the Plainsboro, New Jersey native has already become a fixture of one of the Ivy League’s best defensive units. Harvard’s back line never allowed Yale’s attackers to get comfortable, and with significant contributions from senior keeper Danielle Etzel, it came away with its third consecutive clean sheet this season (their fifth overall).
As women’s soccer prepares for the latter half of its season, which includes games against a number of Ivy League rivals, the team will look to Jillian Wachira and its other promising freshmen to maintain their high level of play. If Harvard continues to defend as effectively as it has in recent games, the Crimson will become a nightmare matchup for opposing attackers; if players keep scoring goals like the one Wachira scored on Saturday night, opposing defenses won’t fare much better.
Harvard will look to keep up their winning ways against lowly Cornell (1-7-1, 0-2-0 Ivy League) on Saturday, October 6 at Jordan Field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 At the outset of the 2018 football season, Harvard coach Tim Murphy was struck by the level of competitiveness his team would face from outside its own conference. In a year in which both parity and skill was expected within the Ivy League, the Crimson would also have to deal with three teams — San Diego, Rhode Island, and Holy Cross — which could all roll into Harvard Stadium and emerge with a victory.
Over the duration of the current senior class’ time in Cambridge, the Crimson boasts an 8-3 record against non-league competition, and two of those losses have come at the hands (or hooves) of the Rams. Currently ranked 17th and 18th in the AFCA and STATS polls, respectively, Rhode Island (3-1, 2-0 CAA) put together a complete victory for its second consecutive win over Harvard.
“We knew they were an outstanding football team,” Murphy said. “They just made more plays than we did. We’ve...got to make more plays on offense to beat a really, really good scholarship football team.”
TYING UP LOOSE ENDS
As it had to contend with a ranked team for the first time all season, the Crimson (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) showed many more signs of weakness than it had against either San Diego or Brown. Harvard managed to coast to victories over both of these programs on the strength of dominant play early in the games. This time, however, the Crimson had to play catch up, and its deficiencies were magnified in a situation with a razor-thin margin of error. Harvard’s shortcomings took the form of both offensive stagnation and a handful of mental lapses or physical mistakes.
In the first quarter, the Crimson defense set the tone that it would maintain for much of the rest of the game, save for an electric second-quarter performance by quarterback JaJuan Lawson that netted the Rams 14 points. However, Rhode Island managed to avoid an opening-period shutout on a Harvard punt attempt.
After a sack brought quarterback Jake Smith down for a loss of seven, the Crimson was set to punt from its own five. The snap came in slightly inaccurate to freshman Jon Sot, who bobbled the ball and had to rush a kick. His effort bounced off a lineman’s back and bounded out the back of the end zone to give the Rams their first lead of the game, 2-0.
In the third quarter, during a stretch in which the defense was having its way with Rhode Island sophomore backup signal caller Vito Priore, Harvard allowed the Rams to add to their 16-6 lead, again on special teams. This time, after the Crimson’s Jake McIntyre hit his second of three field goals, Rhode Island’s Ahmere Dorsey fielded the kickoff at his own three and jetted 97 yards for a return touchdown.
Finally, with 3:34 left in a back-and-forth final quarter that featured five consecutive punts, Harvard had the ball with a chance to tie the game at 23 apiece. On second down, however, Smith tossed the ball directly into the waiting hands of Rams safety D.J. Stewart. Priore threw a pick of his own on a play on which senior defensive back Wes Ogsbury made a fully-outstretched leaping grab, but Smith returned the favor during his next series, again on the second snap. In all, Smith now has four interceptions through three games.
DEFENSE KEEPS ON CHUGGING
The week before Rhode Island visited Cambridge, it traveled to the University of Connecticut and nearly defeated the host FBS program in an offensive shootout. Despite the fact that the 56-49 ballgame ended in a loss for the visitors, the Rams must have been feeling confident in their offense re-entering FCS play.
However, when the dust settled at Harvard Stadium this past Friday night, Rhode Island had scored less than half of the points it had the previous weekend. Despite the Crimson’s offensive struggles, one could argue that the Crimson limited the Rams’ offense more so than the other way around. Harvard recorded more first downs, rushing yards, and total yards. The teams tied in the turnover battle, and the Crimson tallied one more sack and one more tackle for a loss. As outlined above, Rhode Island’s nine special teams points proved to be a deciding factor.
“They played really hard, they played really well, they did a little better coaching job than I did, and the combination of those things made it a very tough, hard-fought game,” Murphy said. “There were two outstanding defenses out there. I thought our defense played heroically. Just got to make more plays offensively.”
In the second half, the Harvard defense conceded just seven points and 20 total yards on 21 snaps. Dorsey’s kick return represented the lone time the Rams even came close to scoring in the final 30 minutes; otherwise, the farthest Rhode Island advanced was to the Crimson’s 28, and the Rams did not cross into Harvard territory on offense during the third quarter. This sustained stellar defensive effort allowed the Crimson to stay within striking distance and have a chance to tie the game
An important factor in Rhode Island’s lackluster scoring was losing Lawson in the second quarter. Lawson was 12-for-16 for 153 yards and two touchdowns, one passing and one rushing. The touchdown he took in himself caused his removal from the game, as he suffered a leg injury colliding with a Harvard defender at the goal line. Rams coach Jim Fleming indicated that Lawson could have re-entered the game if absolutely necessary, but Priore took command of the offense for the remainder of the game.
LOSING THE BATTLE, WINNING THE WAR
Rhode Island now has a two-year winning streak against the Crimson, but that streak will not grow in the near future. The two programs were booked for a four-game series which started in 2015, and Harvard took the first two matchups before falling in the most recent two. However, the Crimson also prevailed in the first-ever meeting between the two schools. In 1923, Harvard shut out Rhode Island, 35-0, at home, making the all-time series 3-2 in favor of the Crimson.
“When I first came and took this job and I saw we had Harvard on the schedule for four straight years, I wanted to punch somebody because they’re a very good football team,” Fleming said.
Discounting that 20th century matchup, the two teams have split their head-to-head games roughly according to the general success of their respective programs. In 2015 and 2016, Harvard put together a 16-4 overall record and won the Ivy League in 2015. The team went through a rough patch last year and is currently in the middle of what some would call a rebuilding phase. The Rams, on the other hand, are a team on the rise, and their wins over the Crimson in 2017 and 2018 demonstrate the now-dominant nature of their squad. For context, in 2015 and 2016 Rhode Island won just three of its 22 contests.

Maybe you live there. Maybe it’s Friday night and your friends think it’s a good idea to check out the Cabot Aquarium (spoiler alert: it’s probably not). Maybe you just want to pet the Pfoho guinea pigs. Everybody needs to go to the Quad sometimes, and the most difficult part isn’t figuring out the shuttle schedule — it’s gathering sufficient motivation to make the arduous trek. Here are a couple ways to get yourself out the door.
A trip to the Quad counts as exercise
Forget a trip to the MAC, the easiest way to get your steps in is a walk to the Quad. Though you might not technically get swole, a trip to the Quad and back is pretty much a revival of your FOP trip, minus the GORP and trowel. Plus, you can brag about your new student-athlete status in the dhall later.
See it as a cultural experience
Sure, a research trip to Madagascar is cool, but the Quad is practically a foreign country, right? Spend the long weekend outside of the Harvard bubble by walking from one part of the campus to another and briefly entering the real world. Bonus points if you get hit by a car while crossing Mass Ave.
Spend some time there and see everything the Quad has to offer
Stop for a cup of coffee in the Cabot Café or some mozzarella sticks in the Quad Grille. Check out the garden, take in the wide open lawn and visit that one friend who got quadded and has been missing ever since. Maybe the Quad isn’t so bad. And if you never leave, you’ll never have to walk to the Quad again. So maybe the best way to motivate yourself is to…
Get Quadded
The most reliable way to get the motivation to get to the Quad is to actually live there. You can tell everybody that it’s “not that bad” and that the Quad has a super tight-knit community, or you can do the smart thing and find a River Daddy.
Be it because of Kuumba rehearsal, a class in the Dance center or just an accident, a trip to the Quad is inevitable. If you haven’t been yet this year, take a trip to the less well-trodden part of Harvard’s campus.
