After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1997, Harvard revealed that it had secretly purchased over 50 acres of land in Allston, the Boston neighborhood right across the river from Harvard’s Cambridge campus. In an effort to appease angry residents, who felt that Harvard had deceived them and feared what would happen to the neighborhood with Harvard as landlord, the University promised that it would use the purchased land to stimulate business in Allston—primarily by building a large Science Complex on Western Avenue. Unfortunately, since then, Harvard’s interactions with Allston have demonstrated that it does not respect its neighbors and its neighborhood.
Harvard broke ground on the Science Complex in 2008 while pledging to give back to the Allston community by turning Allston’s Barry’s Corner into a vibrant neighborhood. Unfortunately, when Harvard’s endowment plummeted during the financial crisis, the University decided to halt construction on the Science Complex indefinitely. The building’s foundation has sat basically untouched in the middle of Allston since 2009. A post in Boston’s community news site Universal Hub ironically notes, “Harvard is listening to residents not looking forward to a decade of living near a crater” by proposing that attractive bushes be planted around the site. To further compensate Allston residents for the revenue lost by their community, Harvard has kindly erected a miniature golf course and provided rat-proof trash cans to Allston residents. How generous.
Of course, Harvard hasn’t done everything wrong. Plans to relocate the Charlesview housing complex have gone ahead bumpily, but steadily. Allston residents expressed optimism that the old Charlesview site would feature an arts and cultural center to benefit both Harvard affiliates and Bostonians. And this year, Harvard finally announced plans to restart development of what will now be a “Health and Life Science Center” in 2014. After pressure from the Harvard-Allston Task Force and Harvard community members, it has also released further plans for development in Allston. Most recently, Harvard has proposed updating its Institutional Master Plan to build a new basketball stadium in Allston, among other things.
But between a meeting last month and a document sent to the Boston Redevelopment Authority last week, Allston residents involved in the Harvard Allston Task Force seem to have very few positive comments about Harvard’s new plan. Community members expressed frustration about Harvard stalling economic activity in Allston, as the University pushed out businesses like K-Mart but has failed to follow through with plans to liven Barry’s Corner. In fact, Harvard’s new plan would turn the space that currently houses the Charlesview Apartments into a parking lot. To this, the Harvard-Allston Task Force responded, “A large surface parking lot in this strategic and highly-visible site is completely contrary to our vision for North Allston. We strongly oppose Barry’s Corner being the backside of Harvard’s campus where undesirable uses are dumped.”
Sadly, conflict with its neighbors is nothing new for Harvard. Less than 50 years ago, a group of hundreds of students and community members protested Harvard’s systematic eviction of residents from low-income housing along the Charles River to make room for Mather House and Peabody Terrace. Members of community organization Riverside Planning Group as well as Harvard and Radcliffe feminists and activists attempted everything from interrupting Commencement in 1970 to occupying a building on Memorial Drive in 1971 to demand low-income housing and a women’s center.
Today, as 50 years ago, there is a fundamental disconnect between the desires of Harvard and the needs of Boston and Cambridge residents whose lives and communities are affected by Harvard. Harvard has broad long-terms plans for expanding graduate school programs and scientific research and acquires land with these 50-year or 100-year plans in mind. Meanwhile, our University seems to view its neighbors as simply a temporary nuisance to be appeased with promises and inexpensive gifts. Harvard should be interacting with its neighbors by constructing projects like the Allston Education Portal proactively, not simply in response to community outcry about mistreatment.
In the past 20 years, Harvard has repeatedly neglected the short- and long-term needs of Allston residents in favor of pursuing its own grand plans for expansion. Unfortunately, unfulfilled promises of community development cannot rectify a decision-making model that does not account for the needs of community residents. As Allston residents and Harvard administrators wait for the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s response to Harvard’s proposed changes to its Institutional Master Plan, they would do well to remember lessons from decades ago: Harvard’s plans for expansion are not and will never be sustainable as long as the University continues to exert its will on Cambridge and Boston without respecting the needs of working- and middle-class community residents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The end of November is one of those rare transition periods in Harvard’s academic calendar. The dregs of midterm season have finally subsided, and reading period is still somewhat out of sight. This leaves students with a hint of a lull in their normally tumultuous schedules, giving them time for half a week off from their daily routines.
Luckily, thanks to a historic proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, this spell coincides with America’s recognition of Thanksgiving Day. This period away from the constant tumult of Harvard life offers students the opportunity to eat turkey, spend time with family, and watch the Detroit Lions lose another Turkey Day game. It also provides ample time for reflection on the aspects of our lives for which we are thankful.
In addition to a respite from schoolwork and President Lincoln’s heroic feats, we have many things to be grateful for, both at Harvard and in the U.S. at large.
A week after the conclusion of Undergraduate Council election season, it remains difficult to forget the high turnout that marked this year’s race. This demonstrates the strength of the civic spirit here on campus and reminds us of the values that characterize our nation. Earlier this month, America voted in its 57th presidential election, reflecting a tradition that has yet to falter in our 236-year history. At a time when other nations contest and change their leadership in woefully chaotic fashions, it is particularly important to remember the fortunate position in which this nation currently finds itself.
That the Harvard community demonstrates a concerted sense of civic responsibility is but one manifestation of our vibrant community, for which we are equally grateful. This month, students have eagerly participated not only in campus-wide and national elections, but also in the annual Harvard-Yale football game, the highly-anticipated appointment of new leadership to Harvard’s many student organizations, and countless other campus activities. We are very thankful for the energy fostered here on campus. While many students take advantage of the break to return home and reconnect with old friends, few would trade in their experiences here in Cambridge. This is a sign of the vibrancy of Harvard life.
As Thanksgiving break ends, one cannot help but look earnestly toward the next break. Some consider it the light at the end of the finals tunnel. Fortunately, winter break is rapidly approaching, and this year it is something to be particularly thankful for. In its efforts to increase Wintersession programming, the College has extended the break a full week. We look forward to the upcoming period of prolonged tranquility that is so often absent from Harvard life.
As classes resume and homework is collected, it is important to keep in mind all that we have to be thankful for. College can be a time of stress and frustration. Yet even oft-stressful Harvard life is not without its splendor, and we are deeply thankful for the all that it continues to offer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, our group, the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee, partnered with the Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance to organize an event that dealt explicitly with the struggle to strengthen a Jewish identity that fights nonviolently for social justice and equality for all people in the Holy Land. Because of the event’s relevance to Jewish audiences, PJA originally reserved a room for the event in Harvard Hillel, the center of Jewish life on campus. Although we were delighted that Harvard Hillel initially agreed to have this dialogue take place in its building, the offer was suddenly revoked a week before the event. Due to pressure from Hillel International, the event was prevented from taking place in Hillel because PSC was a co-sponsor.
 
As rationale for excluding our organization from this dialogue in Hillel, Harvard Hillel’s executive director noted that PSC supports the nonviolent boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. BDS is a movement initiated in 2005 by Palestinian civil society in order to nonviolently demand an end to Israel’s anti-Palestinian policies, and it has since become the largest international, peaceful movement successfully calling for change to these policies. According to the Institute for Middle East Understanding, companies targeted by BDS have lost billions of dollars in contracts, and companies around the world have divested from Israel. In October, Richard A. Falk, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, called for a boycott of all companies profiting from Israeli settlements. 
 
Harvard Hillel’s decision to ban us from co-sponsoring events at Hillel has silenced dissident voices in the Jewish community, a disconcerting act itself, given Hillel’s intention to be a space for all Jewish students. However, it has also made us wonder: if Hillel does not want to interact with pro-Palestinian groups that support nonviolent resistance for peace, how does Hillel expect people to resist Israel’s brutal occupation and well-documented human rights abuses? 
 
Hillel International’s policies opposing groups which support BDS is a disgraceful attempt to silence critique and dissension against the policies of the State of Israel in the Jewish community. We appreciate the solidarity of the Progressive Jewish Alliance and that of countless other pro-peace Jewish groups and hope that Hillel will be able to evolve not only to accept modern discourse on a peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also to accept viewpoints in its community that do not align with those of its main sponsors and leaders.
 
Last week witnessed a dramatic rise in violence between Israelis and Palestinians unprecedented in recent years. The fighting began last week when Israel ended a tacit truce with Hamas by assassinating the Hamas commander who was tasked with enforcing ceasefires and was in the process of negotiating a new one. In the following week, widespread Israeli bombings of Gaza killed at least 150 Palestinians. Hamas and other militant groups responded by firing rockets into Israel, killing five Israeli civilians.
 
The recent violence is the tragic consequence of over 60 years of Israeli dispossession of Palestinian lands and the continuing occupation and siege of the Palestinian people, which has ensured an unsustainable and unlivable reality, especially in Gaza. Between 2007 and 2010, Israel prevented even the most basic of goods—including staples like concrete and medicine as well as items like pasta, fruit juice, and chocolate—from entering the Strip, enforcing a siege by land while controlling and limiting Palestinian access to air and sea. Today, many imports and most exports are still banned by Israel.
 
The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee is strongly opposed to the use of violence by any actor, especially violence targeted at civilians. However, we also recognize that Palestinian support for Hamas and participation in violent resistance is a response to a regime of occupation and human rights abuses that has lasted for over 60 years. This week’s events and Israel’s latest attack on Gaza demonstrate the tragic consequences of violent resistance. 
 
The violence does, however, raises questions for all people who are interested in seeking a just resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Israeli occupation and siege of the Palestinian population is immoral, and it perpetuates an unsustainable situation, resulting in a violent conflict last week in which Palestinians lost their lives daily and Israeli civilians were threatened with violent responses. If we understand this, then we must support resistance against Israeli policies: No government will change its policies if people do not speak out against them. Additionally, all occupied populations have the right to resist, defend, and reclaim their homes and land. It follows that if we truly seek peace in the Holy Land and reject violent resistance as a means to accomplish this, it is irrational and illogical to exclude nonviolent resistance from the available strategies. If Hillel seeks to be a relevant part of discourse on a just peace in the Holy Land today, it must stop silencing those voices that advocate BDS as a form of nonviolent struggle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard students passed a referendum on the Undergraduate Council election ballot that calls on Harvard to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry by an overwhelming margin.
For the resounding success of Referendum 1, we should applaud Harvard students for taking a stance on what is arguably the most important issue of this century. However, divestment from fossil fuel represents an admirable but regrettably bad “bang for the buck” approach to the climate change challenge.
The main practical argument for divestment is that if Harvard divests from fossil fuels, other colleges and investors will follow suit. The collective boycott of fossil fuel stocks will cause a drop in stock price. This possibility forces fossil fuel companies’ CEOs to consider more climate conscious decisions when raising capital for future projects, which will create private sector solutions to a public externality problem.
Although some of Harvard’s educational peers have committed to or are considering divesting, it is completely unclear whether Harvard’s financial peers will make the same move.
More likely than not, Harvard’s financial peers, which include for-profit mutual funds and hedge funds, will not make the same commitment to divest. When Harvard sells its fossil fuel stocks, the fossil fuel companies’ cash flow does not change. Other investors, most of whom do not share Harvard’s environmental values, will notice the drop in stock price without a change in fundamentals and will buy the cheap fossil fuel stocks until they reach the “fair” pre-divestment level.
Contrary to popular belief, Harvard’s unilateral divestment most likely would not decrease the long-term expected return of its endowment. If we rely on historical lessons, a hypothetical divested portfolio may even yield higher returns due to greater emphasis on smaller companies. However, after divestment, Harvard’s portfolio will necessarily be less diversified than before, which exposes Harvard to new financial risks. Whether making a statement with no impact on the fossil fuel industry is worth accruing such risk to the endowment is a normative question, and one we must answer as a community.
In the unlikely event that Harvard’s initiative finds support in other investors, this will create a new paradigm in pricing fossil fuel stocks. Investors shunning industries for their malicious practices is not a new phenomenon: A wide range of industries such as tobacco, gaming, and alcohol have long been considered “sin industries.” There is empirical data showing that sin industry stocks, which face various institutional, social norm, and legal constraints, have lower prices. In this case, Harvard can claim success in causing noticeable financial stress on fossil fuel companies.
However, the same empirical study also finds that, since the stock prices of sin industries are lower, they are better deals than similar companies in other industries. The authors of the study found that the sin stocks generate an additional 2.5 percent return per year. Assuming that Harvard succeeds in labeling fossil fuel companies as “sin stocks,” Harvard’s divestment will miss out on this sizeable extra return. Even if we suppose that Harvard only invests a meager one percent of its endowment in fossil fuels, a back-of-envelope estimate will show that divestment will cost Harvard about $7.5 million in potential return every year. I believe Harvard could put that $7.5 million to better use advancing environmental causes.
For one, Harvard can contribute to the environmental movement by directing the $7.5 million in endowment return to environmental policy research. The Harvard Environmental Economics Program at the Kennedy School of Government, for example, enlists Professor Eric S. Maskin and Professor Martin L. Weitzman, both of whom won accolades for applying the economic theory of uncertainty to the cost-benefit analyses of environmental policy and climate change.
Admittedly, environmental economics is an extremely complex problem with more unknowns than cost-benefit analyses may be suitable for, but it is precisely such difficult problems that Harvard, as a premier research institution, is positioned to address. Increasing funding in programs like HEEP will not only expand our knowledge in these areas, but it will also inform our future political and civic leaders on these critical issues. While campus environmental activism may galvanize student awareness and affirm Harvard’s commitment to the environment in the short term, an economic, cost-benefit analytical approach will prepare the campus and the nation for a sensible discourse on environmental policy that will create long-term solutions. It is from this perspective, rather than from a normative stance on the moral cause of environmentalism, that I urge my fellow students to reconsider the costs and benefits of the divestment movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new test for tuberculosis could efficiently reduce the prevalence of TB in southern Africa by over 28 percent, according to a study released last week by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
The new automated DNA test, Xpert, has the potential to cost-effectively combat TB, which is thought to infect over one-third of the world’s population. According to lead author Nicolas Menzies, a Ph.D. candidate in health policy at HSPH, Xpert is more sensitive than traditional diagnostic tests, which only accurately identify about fifty percent of cases.
A greater number of countries have begun to adopt Xpert since the World Health Organization recommended its use in treating cases of TB suspected to be multi-drug resistant or HIV-associated, which are thought to be particularly dangerous.
“This test is one of the most significant developments in TB control options in many years,” Menzies said in an HSPH press release. “Our study is the first to look at the long-term consequences of this test when incorporated into routine health programs.”
Using mathematical models to project the potential consequences of implementing Xpert over 10- and 20-year periods in five southern African nations, the researchers found that implementation would avert 182,000 TB deaths and 132,000 TB cases in southern Africa over the next 10 years.
“Adopting this test does look like it would do what’s promised,” Menzies said. Menzies also added, however, that they did not see as significant of a reduction in incidence, the number of new cases each year, as they would have expected.
Looking at the cost of the test, Menzies said that it was not the “slam dunk” the researchers had expected, partially because of the increased treatment costs of surviving patients saved by Xpert.
Menzies also pointed out that conclusions would be very different in other regions, a further problem he’s interested in working on.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 26
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the new tuberculosis test Xpert would reduce costs to the health care system. In fact, Xpert is projected to cost the health system $401 million to $520 million over 10 years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friends and family of George H. Eastman braved the cold, gathering around the Winnie-the-Pooh tree by the Science Center Sunday afternoon to celebrate Eastman’s 81st birthday.
Eastman, a Cambridge resident and an alumnus of the Graduate School of Education, has been the unofficial caretaker of Pooh’s house since 1995. That year, he took it upon himself to build a red door for the tree, which had previously lacked an entrance.
“This has been an important part of his life, and many people know about the tree and Pooh’s door,” said Eastman’s partner Marilyn Gallant, who organized the event. “There’s a lot of chatter about it on the Internet and it just seemed like a different way to spend his birthday.”
Eastman’s fascination with Winnie-the-Pooh began when he read the books to his children when they were young.
“Before I can remember, we would bike by here on the way to church every Sunday, and we would always stop by and leave a little gift for Pooh and see what other people had left,” said his daughter Serena C. Eastman.
For George Eastman, who holds a degree in philosophy from the School of Education, the story of Winnie-the-Pooh is more than just a children’s story—it is a tale that holds a great deal of philosophical significance.
“Each of the characters represents
something unique about being human,” Eastman said. “Winnie represents a human being who is willing not to pretend to know everything.”
Pooh’s tree became Eastman’s pet project in 1995, when he took the initiative to repaint the faded “Pooh” sign on the tree and attach a door where there had previously been only a hole. After that, Eastman became the unofficial gatekeeper for the tree and his whole family became attached to the project.
Deborah M. Allen, Eastman’s ex-wife, said that their family used to gather the money that accumulated by the tree and donate it to their church.
“We’re talking pennies, but we felt very proprietary about the place because George made this door for it,” said Allen.
Throughout the years the Winnie-the-Pooh tree has gone through many transformations. Houses for Rabbit and Piglet were added were added, then removed. The tree itself was chopped down this past summer.
All the while, Eastman has continued to watch over Pooh’s home.
“Sometimes people would come and break the door. My dad has made probably four or five or six doors over the years,” Serena Eastman said.
For the Eastman family, Pooh’s tree has served as an uplifting force in their lives.
“It’s just such a positive thing when the world is so negative,” Gallant said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the sound of the final buzzer, the stands erupted in cheers and the Harvard women’s ice hockey team skated onto the ice to embrace freshman goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
The reaction was justified considering the No. 7 Crimson (6-1, 6-0 ECAC) had just toppled No. 2 Cornell, 3-1, to end a losing streak that dated back to 2008. The win capped a perfect home weekend for Harvard, which downed Colgate, 4-1, on Friday night.
For everyone on the team, from seniors on down, it was the first time they had ever beaten the Big Red.
“Every single time we play them it’s a really challenging game, and they’re tough and competitive,” said co-captain Jillian Dempsey who had the biggest weekend of all. “To come away with a win, it feels amazing right now.”
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 1
And yet based on the Crimson’s performance on Saturday, the outcome did not seem so amazing.
Harvard outplayed the Big Red, outshooting its opponent, 33-22. While Cornell came in averaging 4.66 goals per game, it scored only when Erin Barley-Maloney beat Maschmeyer early in the second period to make it 1-1.
Then junior Kalley Armstrong scored the winner for Harvard 7:42 into the third, and junior Lyndsey Fry finished it off with an empty-netter.
Coming into the season, Cornell was the overwhelming favorite to repeat as ECAC champion, but with the Crimson’s big win the conference championship is now put in a different light. The win puts Harvard two points behind the Big Red in conference standings, with the Crimson playing two fewer games to date.
“We really focused on our forecheck,” Armstrong said, “getting on their sticks as fast as possible. Getting on them quick to stop them from setting up really helped us.”
Dempsey, who had five shots through the game, scored the first goal early in the opening period. The co-captain was able to nudge the puck past Cornell goalie Lauren Slebodnick to put Harvard up, 1-0. Dempsey extended her streak of games with at least a point to 21.
“[Friday] night we [talked about] getting a lot of shots on net,” Dempsey said. “This time we were really trying to just get pucks in the net, get the rebound, and create chaos in front of their goalie.”
The Big Red came out swinging in the second frame. Barley-Maloney scored from out wide only two minutes into the period, but Harvard quickly put the shackles back on the Big Red.
“Everybody was busting their tails all over the ice,” Dempsey said. “There was a lot of talking, and our defense and goaltending was phenomenal today. We were backchecking hard and giving a lot of pressure, and we had a solid, cohesive unit back on defense.”
The Crimson shut down the Big Red on all four of its power plays. Harvard is now 20 for 21 in penalty kill, which leads the nation.
Harvard, aside from having more shots on goal, had many more chances to score than Cornell did. Freshman Mary Parker rattled a shot off the far post late in the first period. Senior Kaitlin Spurling received a penalty shot 15 minutes into the second period after being hacked on a breakaway but barely missed the ensuing shot.
The Crimson defense was anchored by Maschmeyer, who had 21 saves. Several clutch saves near the end of the game kept Big Red from making a comeback.
“She was phenomenal,” Dempsey said. “Being a freshman too, to step up and play that huge, we needed that from her, and we’re hoping [for] a lot more like that for the rest of the season.”
Sophomore Michelle Picard also geared the offense with three assists, contributing on every goal of the night. Parker and sophomore Sarah Edney each notched an assist as well.
But nobody had a weekend quite like Dempsey.
HARVARD 4, COLGATE 1
Dempsey began her four-point weekend with a two-assist performance at Bright Hockey Center.
Both helpers came in a standout second period in which Harvard had 13 shots on net with three goals and limited the Raiders to only one shot in the 20 minutes. The explosive frame put the Crimson ahead 4-1 and put the game out of reach.
With the score 1-1 entering the second period, Harvard came out and dominated on offense and defense. Hillary Crowe scored early in the second period before Sarah Edney cashed a power play and put the puck past Raiders goalie Ashlynn Rando.
Hilary Hayssen scored late in the period off an assist from Dempsey to extend the lead to 4-1.
Dempsey notched two assists on the day. The senior leads the team with eight assists.
The only black spot on an otherwise solid outing was Phillips’ goal for the Raiders that came off a power play. Phillips’ goal marked the first power-play score the Crimson has allowed this season.
The defense was anchored by co-captain goaltender Laura Bellamy, who tallied 10 saves.

Researchers at the Harvard Medical School didn't intend to pinpoint a gene that can predict time of death, but somehow that's exactly what happened.
The Memory and Aging Project enrolled 1200 healthy people at age 65 and followed them with annual neurological and psychiatric examinations until they died. The researchers ultimately discovered a spot in the genome that is correlated with a full hour per day of difference in wake-sleep behavior, called a single nucleotide polymorphism, or SNP. The variations among individuals' SNPs lead to differences in those same individual's natural daily rhythms, or circadian clocks.
But the gene's importance goes beyond sleep cycles. "There are circadian rhythms of almost all body processes, including blood pressure, digestion, [and] body temperature," Dr. Clifford Saper, one of the researchers and James Jackson Putnam Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, wrote in an email. "There is even a circadian rhythm of death. In a normal population, there is a peak of deaths in the morning hours, with an average time of death around 11 a.m."
These findings have big implications for the command we have over our own body functions on a day-to-day basis. "A very large amount of the behavior we exhibit on a daily basis—early risers, or larks, vs. late  night people, or owls—is dictated by this one gene variation," Saper wrote.
According to the study, our dispositions are influenced by more than simply free will. Differences among the population can be attributed to a single gene, one that works in all of us and decides how well we function during the day, whether we like it or not.
So next time you find yourself having trouble waking up in the morning, you have more than sheer laziness to blame. And if you're now fearing the late morning hours, remember that some think you're luckiest when the clock reads 11:11 a.m.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology edged out Harvard to top a study comparing cognitive skills released earlier this month.
Unlike other college ranking systems, this study analyzed results from online games that use neuroscience to measure five aspects that contribute to intelligence: speed, attention, flexibility, memory, and problem solving.
Lumosity, the company that conducted the study, examined over 60,000 college students from over 400 American colleges, obtaining their data from their database of over 450 million plays by over 30 million global users—the largest database of human cognitive performance in the world.
Stanford, Northwestern, and Yale rounded out the top five overall.
The study also broke down each of the five cognitive areas: Harvard students topped in speed, Dartmouth in attention, Yale in flexibility (Flyby was going make a joke about how Yalies are experienced in adapting to losing before we remembered that they always lose), the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in memory, and MIT in problem-solving.
This is the first such ranking system, explains Daniel Sternberg, data scientist at Lumosity and the man who led the initiative.
Rankings were strongly correlated with those based on a college's median composite SAT and ACT scores and with the U.S. News & World Report's annual college rankings. Problem solving scores, in particular, showed strong correlation with SAT scores.
Sternberg did point out, however, that many colleges that he expected to do better fell in overall rankings because of their memory scores, including Brown, Columbia, Penn, Princeton, and Yale, all of which failed to crack the top 25 in terms of memory.
He also said that he would like to repeat the study annually explaining the impact such initiatives could have on shaping our perceptions of human ability.

All they have to do is add the liquids (be sure to include a recipe), mix, and bake. Layer ingredients for visual appeal and be sure to accent with a bow!
 
Sexy Soap: As college students, we sometimes neglect hygiene. Ensure your friend smells fresh during the holiday season with this accented cleanser. Buy a nice bar of soap (look for pretty colors and fragrant aromas) and, using a toothpick, carve designs, messages, or a picture into the soap. The recipient will think of you every time they shower!
 
Decorate the Tree: Regardless of religion, anyone can appreciate a tree ornament. These unique mementos make great presents even if you don't have a pine branch to hang them on. Make your friend a one-of-a-kind ornament this year either by decorating a clear ornament or starting from scratch with clay.
 
Go Prehistoric: Once upon a time, photo albums existed independently of the internet. It's never too early to prepare for the Facebook apocalypse by downloading and printing photographs of you and your recipient. Arrange them in an album (don't worry you can still tag and caption them). Include a disposable camera for memories to come!
 
And then there's always the Starbucks gift card.
