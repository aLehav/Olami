After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Economics concentrators have some reason to celebrate now that Harvard has reinstated the department’s junior seminars. After cutting the program from this year’s curriculum due to financial circumstances, the College is adding six seminars over the next academic year, each with a maximum of 18 students. While this is a positive move overall, economics concentrators would benefit from additional changes to the program.
Large classes and limited teacher-student interaction have long beleaguered Harvard’s largest concentration, and bringing back seminars is clearly a step in the right direction. Ideally, students will have greater opportunities to substantively connect with their peers and instructors, in a more intimate class environment. However, the number of seminars—which decreased relative to years past—and their relatively large size limit the benefits students can derive from such courses. Offering more seminars with smaller class sizes within the department should be a priority for the College.
In order to meet this goal, the administration should expand the number of Harvard professors who teach such classes. In the past, economics seminars were generally headed by visiting faculty members. When the department’s visitor budget was slashed last year in the name of streamlining costs, there were fewer instructors on campus to teach the seminars. This was cited as a reason for the program’s temporary elimination. Although the department recently experienced an influx of visiting faculty, thanks to a partially restored budget, it should not depend on outside instructors to teach its most intimate courses.
Since six seminars will be offered next year, participation is clearly limited to only a fraction of each class of students. Economics—the largest department at Harvard, with over 700 concentrators—is already understaffed, with large student-to-faculty ratios and unwelcomingly massive lecture courses. More seminars, with as small or smaller enrollment, should be added to supplement the curriculum of students who often do not receive the personal attention present in other departments. Indeed, the academic development of economics concentrators is especially important given the barrage of economic issues prevalent today, and students should have the privilege of having one small class.
For this year’s juniors, it is likely disappointing that the opportunity to take a seminar was unavailable to them. Thus, it is only fair that students from the class of 2011 have access to the seminars offered next year, when they are seniors.
It is admirable that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reinstated the seminar program for economics concentrators. However, providing these six classes cannot alone ensure that students reach their full academic potential. Economics seminars must be replicated and restructured to be more sustainable, worthwhile, and inclusive for Harvard’s largest group of undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


In framing the American mindset toward history, historian Richard Hofstadter wrote that we as a people prefer "a spirit of sentimental appreciation rather than of critical analysis." In other words, under a veil of blind nostalgia, Americans quickly become attached to a particular narrative as the one correct interpretation of a murky past. Challenges to this worldview, then, are often met with the most vitriolic of reactions, as champions of the established historical guard fiercely defend that which they consider "proper" American history.
This explains why the recommendations offered by the Texas Board of Education to textbook publishers have inflamed debate over the integrity of our nation’s curriculum. Divisive terms such as "brainwashing," "conservative," and "partisan" color the controversy as each side derides the other for skewing history for political gain. The question of whether the Board’s actions are justified has been opined upon to no end. But such haranguing distracts from a larger issue at hand; the controversy should force Americans to reevaluate their entire sense of history and cast a more critical eye on the interpretation of our past.
It’s tempting and easy to consider one interpretation of American history an unequivocal fact. A thorough reading of Howard Zinn’s "A People’s History of the United States" can make a lasting impression on the reader’s sense of the past. However, this is but a singular lens through which to view a very abstract construct. Someone studying the more conservative interpretation offered by Larry Schweikart’s "A Patriot’s History of the United States" will hold a countervailing perspective on the events that shaped this nation. When a debate over curriculum arises, either side will maintain that their’s is the true history, while the other’s is but partisan indoctrination. This either-or attitude does little to advance the critical analysis that is necessary to fully understanding our past. There is no "true" history, only honest and open discussion of the past. Only through mature dialogue about these differences can anything productive emerge from such a bitter argument.
While critics allege that the Board is advancing a conservative agenda, some of the proposed nuances to the teaching of American history may, in fact, provide a fuller analysis of events to the curriculum. For instance, Cold War historians of either political persuasion have long believed that the Venona documents—recordings of Americans who spied for the Soviet Union during the McCarthyism era—deserve mentioning in textbooks. Also, while the inclusion of the Black Panthers in discussions of the civil rights movement may taint its image somewhat, it is nevertheless crucial to understanding the evolving militancy of black mobilization in the mid-sixties. So before opponents associate all of the recommendations as mere brainwashing, it’s important to see that there are gaps in our history that must be filled so children will have a more balanced analysis of our complex past.
Social sciences rarely offers a single answer to the questions they present, and thus in interpreting the past, we must not view historical interpretations as inherently antagonistic to each other. The debate involving the Texas Board will eventually subside, but the bigger issue regarding the way we perceive our history will persist.
The complacency of our interpretative mindset fails to advance the inquiry into what got us where we are today. In order to gain a better sense of ourselves we must synthesize different perspectives to formulate a more conscientious analysis of who we are as Americans. If we can do this in the midst of this hostile debate, then Americans can perhaps finally prove Hofstadter’s interpretation delightfully false.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cost of college tuition across the country rose five percent last year, making college education inaccessible for many bright students. Some high school graduates are now relying solely on their intellectual faculties and ingenuity to build successful local businesses that don’t require degrees to manage.
From owners of the smallest mom and pop shops to executives of the mightiest corporations, not going to college these days is becoming increasingly trendy in some circles. But because the place of the modern university education is so essential for the political, economic, and social development of most individuals, it would be optimal for one to invest in their education through such accessible plans as a 529 college savings plan.
The 529 college savings plan is designed to be a tax-deferred investment tool for higher education. The beauty and simplicity of the plan is that the government has a very limited ability to obstruct or intervene when it comes to who can donate to or benefit from the plan. Money for school and basic expenses are met using a simplified investment vehicle not perishable to the vagaries of market forces and unscrupulous human behavior.
However, there are some disadvantages to this plan. The investment vehicle is strictly limited to college expenses. One cannot have a 529 plan to take spring break trips to Cancun or purchase expensive shopping items in order to be as trendy as their peers. The fund is strictly there to provide access to higher education for those who would not necessarily be able to afford it.
And herein lay the problem of most scholarships. A grant and scholarship exists to provide an education using a fixed amount of money. An education is an investment and so is a high school graduate. If we take a high school graduate, the money we put into his education, and the school he attends all as investment vehicles, then scholarships should be turned into college savings plans that pump an initial volume of funds into a portfolio that is guaranteed to bring a positive return.
Assessing which portfolios are guaranteed to bring returns is a tricky task. The way the local and global economy works is such that market forces allow prices to fluctuate. The value of anything is subject to market forces, even a college education. In some countries’ economies, going to college is actually a disadvantageous thing to do. But because we value a university education so much in America, it is a premium. The more prestigious the school and the more degrees one racks up, the higher the probability that they are going to land that cushion job that they worked so hard to get.
Thus, if we choose to define our economy and our lifestyles such that a modern university education is at the core of one’s financial security and social stability, then the government, individuals and the private sector should work in collaboration to make investing in 529 college savings plans or variants of the plan a priority. Students should be encouraged to get good grades, involve themselves in activities, and be model citizens to garner the endorsement of nonprofit organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. By 2016, the Gates Foundation will have sent 27,000 low-income high school graduates to colleges and universities across the country.
Investing in a modern university education bears little risk in today’s difficult financial times. Five hundred twenty-nine college savings plans and variants of it are the best way to start. The impact on our economy will be an increase in education across the spectrum, which will cause businesses to grow as the skills and goals of business owners will align and synergize in equilibrium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like most left-of-center people, I strongly support the health care bill that passed the House Sunday afternoon. The concrete benefits are familiar, but always worth repeating. According to Congressional Budget Office estimates, it would reduce the ranks of the uninsured by 32 million by 2019, ultimately ensuring that 95 percent of non-elderly legal residents of the U.S. will have coverage. In doing so, it will make a large dent in the 45,000 yearly deaths attributable to a lack of health insurance. It will ban clearly unjust practices, such as denying coverage based on a pre-existing illness or disability, and reduce premiums for many working class families.
Just as critically, this bill will finally establish the provision of basic health services as the responsibility of the federal government. Before this bill, America was a country where the government could disclaim responsibility when its citizens suffered and died early due to diseases beyond their control. Now, such cruel neglect is not an option.
There have been some fair criticisms of the bill from both sides. Liberal critics are right to condemn the bill’s restrictions on funding for insurance plans that cover abortion, which could function as an effective ban on the procedure for poor women. Conservatives and centrists are right to condemn the bill’s cost control measures, which do not go far enough in moving to a system where doctors are compensated for quality of outcomes, not quantity of procedures. These are both areas of reform that can, and should, be pursued in future revisions to the bill.
However, one criticism of the bill, or more precisely of the original Senate bill that it amends, cannot go unchallenged. First, a bit of history: To win the support of Senator Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat from Nebraska, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid inserted a provision into the Senate health bill providing funds to the state government of Nebraska. One of the main ways the health care bill expands coverage is by increasing access to Medicaid, which is funded with a combination of federal and state dollars. Under Reid and Nelson’s deal, this expansion would be fully funded for by the federal government for a number of years, but only in Nebraska.
The public outcry was as swift as it was vicious. Republicans decried the bill as the “Cornhusker Kickback,” with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell calling it a “kind of smelly proposition.” Twelve Republican state attorneys general speciously claimed the deal was unconstitutional, as though the Supreme Court would ever strike it down. Even Republican Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman and the vast majority of Nebraskans rejected the proposal as unfair.
Certainly, the deal is unfair, but its critics made the deal seem like some kind of dastardly act of corruption—as its epithet says, a “kickback.” But Ben Nelson did not stand to benefit from the deal. He has health care, and quite good health care at that. The ones benefiting were the poor citizens of Nebraska, whose health care would not be at the whims of a miserly, budget-balancing state government for the next decade. Medicaid expansion is an enormously effective way of extending access to health care. MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, the most knowledgeable expert on American health care financing, estimates that Medicaid is far more efficient than either individual or employer health care tax credits, providing a dollar in insurance for every $1.17 the government spends.
But Medicaid is also a perpetual whipping boy of state legislatures and governors, who, with the exception of Vermont’s, are required to balance their budgets. Medicaid is often the first program cut, because gutting it does politicians little harm—after all, the poor have little means by which to fight back. Just look at what has happened in Arizona, where Governor Jan Brewer dropped 310,000 from the Medicaid rolls, and eliminated outright the state’s children’s health care program, leaving 47,000 additional children uninsured. The federal government, by contrast, can run deficits and has representatives, like Nelson, willing to fight for funding for their states’ Medicaid programs. The more the federal government is involved in Medicaid, then, the safer poor families are from the states’ morally bankrupt budgetary processes. The Cornhusker Kickback, then, was a step in the right direction.
To their credit, the Obama administration and Congressional leaders opted not to end the Nebraska provision but to make it universal. The health care bill will pay for all Medicaid expansion costs until 2020, after which it will pay for 90 percent. But this likely would not have happened without Nelson’s original deal, and his subsequent suggestion that it be expanded. More distressingly, the outrage over the deal makes for a perverse incentive, one that may discourage future efforts of Senators and Congressmen to help the poor in their states and districts. Caring for the less fortunate is a sign of humanity, not corruption, and the Nelson deal’s critics should be ashamed of suggesting otherwise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust spent eight days of her spring break meeting with top government and education leaders in Japan and China, underscoring the University’s efforts to bolster its international presence.
Spending the bulk of her time in Japan, Faust met with Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama to discuss the declining number of Japanese students studying at American universities—something Hatoyama, who studied at Stanford, said he wished to address, according to Harvard history professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74, who participated in the meeting.
As the number of Japanese students at Harvard has fallen by one third in recent years—from 151 students in 1999 to 101 last year—Faust urged Japan’s university leaders to encourage their students to study at Harvard.
“It’s part of Harvard’s globalization goal to attract the very best talent from around the world,” said Susan J. Pharr, a professor of Japanese politics and director of the Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, who accompanied Faust on the trip. “Having the president go to Japan is a way to deepen the relationship, and to make sure that Harvard is well known in Japan.”
Faust left Japan for a two-day stint in China, where she celebrated the opening of the Harvard Center Shanghai—Harvard Business School’s first international teaching facility—which will function as a home for the school’s executive education programs in China as well as collaborative work between faculty at Harvard and Chinese universities.
Faust described the center as a hub for “the global enterprise of higher education” and stressed the importance of continued collaboration with universities in Asia during her remarks at the event.
William C. Kirby, chairman of the Harvard China Fund, said he hoped the center would pave the way for more academic partnerships with Chinese univerisities, support undergraduates and faculty research efforts, and bolster Harvard’s presence in China.
“This is not a culmination but a beginning of a new set of efforts in a new century,” Kirby said. “It was really energizing to people who are now seeing the physical incarnation of Harvard’s committment to be an international university.”
China is currently the most popular destination for undergraduates studying abroad, said Kirby, who was instrumental in improving undergraduate access to international programs during his tenure as dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
In addition to her usual meetings with international alumni, Faust stopped by a girls’ high school in Japan to discuss challenges that continue to face women in the workplace—continuing her tradition of raising women’s issues while visiting schools for girls abroad, which she did most recently on her November trip to South Africa and Botswana.
But Faust also ventured off the beaten path during her downtime.
Faust and her husband, history of science professor Charles E. Rosenberg, visited a rare bookstore in Tokyo, where the two self-professed book lovers spent an hour and a half perusing the store’s eighth-century manuscripts, according to Gordon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young announced last night that he will expand the Middle Grades Initiative—which originally sought to restructure the city’s K-8 system to include middle schools—to address all grades, a change resulting from concerns that the initiative was too narrow to comprehensively address the achievement gaps in Cambridge schools.
The vote on restructuring the middle schools was originally scheduled to be taken on May 18, but will now be delayed.
The Initiative was developed under the assumption that middle grades were the “weak link” in the district, according to School Committee member Patricia M. Nolan ’80. However, concerns have arisen that problems in middle grades cannot be addressed without a broader investigation of issues occuring from preschool through senior year of high school, Nolan said.
She said that despite the perception that they are the weakest aspect of the school system, there has recently been some achievement in middle grades, and that the educational disparities found in middle grades also exist in Cambridge’s elementary and high schools.
The new plan will address programs such as the controlled choice plan, special education, and early childhood education, which will go well beyond the scope of the original initiative.
Nolan praised the actions of the superintendent, saying, “you can’t address middle schools without relating [them] to others.”
She said it was important that the committee plan for “a long-term budget,” that takes all grades into account.
However, both Nolan and fellow Committee member Marc C. McGovern predict that some frustration and criticism will result from the change.
“There will be some who will try to spin this in the way to say that [Young] does not have leadership,” McGovern said.
Like Nolan, he commended Young’s willingness to “change the hypothesis” about the source of educational disparities, rather than “change the facts” to fit his original assumptions.
Young said that he will both elaborate on the details of the plan and announce the new timetable during the April 6 public meeting, when the committee will vote go ahead with a scheduled vote to approve its budget for next year.
The April meeting will include votes on several proposals which could potentially be included in next year’s budget, including moving fifth through eighth grade classes for students with emotional disabilities to the Peabody School, which already includes a K-4 class for such students. However, this change would require moving the Special Start program, a preschool for children with disabilities, to another school, which may disrupt the “history and community ties” that the school has, said Nicholas Gross, a parent and school council member at Peabody School.
Gross said he was optimistic that the program would not be moved. “I think there is a lot of goodwill toward the Special Start program, and it looks like they will try to keep it at the Peabody School,” he said.

CORRECTION: Mar. 24, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 24 news article "Young Expands Initiative to All Grades" stated that the Cambridge School Committee is considering converting the the Peabody School from K-4 to K-8. In fact, the Peabody School is already a K-8. The proposal discussed would in fact move fifth through eighth grade classes for students with emotional disabilities from two other schools to the Peabody School.

A nonprofit environmental organization will move its headquarters to Harvard property in Allston this April, marking the University’s first succesful letting of a vacant property in the neighborhood since the December announcement of the halt of construction on the Allston Science Complex.
Last December, University President Drew G. Faust had announced that Harvard would be aggressively pursuing tenants for its unoccupied holdings in Allston in the wake of the indefinite halt of the science complex—a major component of Harvard’s plans to build a new campus across the Charles River.
On April 26, the Earthwatch Institute—an international nonprofit environmental organization—is set to occupy 15,000 square feet of space in the building that formerly housed WGBH’s media headquarters on 114 Western Avenue, University officials announced today. The institute will have a five-year lease with an option to renew for another five years.
The lease is representative of Harvard’s overall strategy of pursuing tenants for its vacant properties, according to Christine M. Heenan, vice president for public affairs and communications.
“We have looked wherever possible to fulfill a number of goals in our leasing strategy,” Heenan said. “We want active, vibrant, organizations which underscore priorities that overlap with our educational mission, while fulfilling economic development strategies that make sense for the city of Boston.”
In keeping with an “aggressive strategy” in pursuing possible tenants, Harvard has employed 13 brokers to find tenants for its unoccupied retail, warehouse, and office space in Allston, according to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who oversees the leasing of Allston property.
Harvard has approached “dozens and dozens” of organizations that might be interested in letting space in Allston, specifically those located in Cambridge, Lapp said.
Though the commercial real estate market in Boston and the nation is currently in crisis, Lapp said the economic climate will not deter Harvard’s goals in leasing its unoccupied properties.
“That hasn’t slowed us,” Lapp said. “In fact, it’s challenged us.”
Lapp said that she and her team have been targeting organizations that will “enhance the community,” such as the Earthwatch Institute, which approached the University about a potential lease a little under a year ago.
The institute—which engages in scientific field research and education to promote a sustainable environment—will offer three fellowships for Allston/Brighton public school teachers to join one of its research expeditions, according to Earthwatch President and CEO Ed Wilson.
He said he hopes that Earthwatch will hold lectures, open houses, and other forms of outreach to neighboring communities starting in June, and that the organization will have the opportunity to partner with the University on various projects.
Heenan noted that Earthwatch’s mission fell in line with the University’s commitment to sustainability.
“Harvard looks for synergies,” she said. “We really consider this a triple win: a win for Harvard, a win for Earthwatch, a win for the city of Boston.”
Paul Berkeley, an Allston resident, said he was pleased to see Harvard leasing to a “cutting edge” environmental group, given the halt on the construction of the Science complex.
Wilson said the move to Allston from Maynard, Mass. was motivated by a desire to be more centrally located and the proximity to Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II of this story appeared on March 23, 2010.)
As the College turns its attention to a sweeping review of academic dishonesty at Harvard, one topic continues to come up in discussions: an honor code.
According to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, faculty and adminstrators have begun preliminary discussions about the adoption of an honor code at Harvard.
“I think we’re at a moment where we must be thinking about doing something [about academic dishonesty],” said Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. “I think looking much more carefully at honor codes is certainly something that would only be responsible at this moment.”
Beyond the nebulous expectation that the policy would heighten student integrity, the format of a Harvard honor code—should one ever come to pass—remains decidedly unclear.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the form and details of a potential Harvard honor code, one thing remains certain: many College administrators are looking for a way to combat academic dishonesty at Harvard—which Harris recently called “a real problem”—and they hope that an honor code may be the solution.
A NEBULOUS IDEA
While the College adminstration’s discussions about student integrity have pointed to an honor code as a potential remedy to academic dishonesty, administrators are hesitant to describe the exact nature of a Harvard honor code and emphasize that the idea is in the premature stages of planning.
“Honor codes are a genus, not a species,” Harris says. “[We’ve] got to figure out what is the species that adapts well to [the Harvard] eco-system.”
Essentially, an honor code is a document signed by students who promise to uphold certain standards of conduct. The policy is typically accompanied by an assumption of integrity on the part of students—consequently, schools that institute honor codes will often allow or even encourage unproctored exams, for example.
But beyond these basic elements, the differences between one honor code and the next can be significant.
“It seems like there’s really a spectrum of types of honor codes to have,” says Gabriel Schwartz, student co-chair of Haverford College’s Honor Council.
While Schwartz says some schools, such as the United States Military Academy at West Point, have rigidly defined honor systems, Haverford has an honor code that evolves every year.
At Haverford, Schwartz says, “There’s much more of a focus on dialogue...on really getting to understand the person and their perspective.”
As part of the school’s semi-annual “Plenary,” undergraduates meet to change, adapt, and then eventually ratify a new version of Haverford’s honor code.
Meanwhile, at West Point the essence of the honor code is that “a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.” The code carries the serious expectation—accompanied by threat of punishment—that students turn in their peers who have violated the honor code or risk violating it themselves.
While at both Haverford and West Point, the honor codes’ jurisdiction extends beyond students’ academic lives, many other schools—such as Princeton and Stanford—have less expansive honor codes that are primarily restricted to matters of academic dishonesty.
Both Hammonds and Undergraduate Council President Johnny Bowman acknowledged that Princeton’s honor code could be a model Harvard might opt to emulate.
Princeton has an Honor Committee, composed of nine undergraduates and three alternate students, that hears and makes recommendations for cases involving charges of academic dishonesty.
On every exam students must write “I pledge my honor that I have not violated the honor code during this examination,” and sign their names. But Peter Dunbar, chair of the Princeton Honor Committee, says that the school’s honor code is much more than a sentence atop an exam page.
“The Honor Code permits students to take ownership of the classroom, of their own work,” Dunbar wrote in an e-mailed statement. “It also underscores a set of values and a focus on integrity that the University and its student body looks to promote, which is in line with our school’s mission and motto.”
“A PARADIGM SHIFT”
The idea of an honor code is part of a broader movement within the College to address issues of academic dishonesty and promote a “culture of greater integrity,” according to Harris. Administrators say they hope it would bring about a change in College’s academic atmosphere.
“All the research shows an honor code does reduce plagiarism and academic dishonesty,” Bowman says.
But beyond just combating academic dishonesty, Harris says the College is hoping to promote a better “community of learning.”
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Barry S. Kane, the current academic environment of the College is a contradictory one.
“In general, we expect students to lead their lives with a level of integrity, and yet when we look at the way we do academic requirements and the way we do exams, there’s a stark contrast to that,” Kane says. “Basically the message we send is we expect you to cheat, and we’re going to do everything we can to stop that from happening.”
Harris echoed Kane’s sentiments, calling the faculty-student relationship at Harvard “sometimes more adversarial than I’d like it to be.”
Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell­—who went to a college with a honor code—says she hopes to see an honor code adopted at Harvard: “I would be very heartened if we were ready for a paradigm shift.”
Administrators stress that students must be involved and committed to the honor code at Harvard if it is to be a successful endeavor.
“The institutions in which honor codes have worked best are ones in which the students actively engage in supporting the honor code and where the notion of communal responsibility emanates from the students,” says Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson, who previously worked with the honor code at Colgate University.
“Students need to be integrated into the creation of the honor code in every step,” Bowman says. “[The UC] wrote a short paper advocating a number of years ago for an honor code, so it’s something that we have been behind for a while.”
Hysen offered a more cautious outlook on student opinion: “I think that once a lot of the benefits of the honor code are clear, I think that it’s something that the UC and hopefully the student body will get behind.”
HONOR CODE AND THE AD BOARD
If Harvard College were to adopt an honor code, it remains unclear what effect it would have on the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.
Most schools with honor codes include students as part of their disciplinary bodies. For example, Princeton’s Honor Committee investigates possible violations of the honor code and makes a recommendation of disciplinary action to their the Dean of Undergraduate Students.
Some administrators worry that faculty members might not be comfortable with trusting students to keep cases confidential.
“In the past, the concern with students was not at all couched in terms of ceding power, it was a matter of confidentiality,” says Kane, who also sits on the Ad Board.
Bisson says that an honor code would require an increase in faculty and administrators’ trust in students.
Currently, the College does have a Student Faculty Judiciary Board, though it has only heard one case since its inception in 1987.
The Committee to Review the Ad Board recommends altering the role of the Student Faculty Judicial Board and renaming it the Student-Faculty Administrative Board, which would be given a larger role in deciding cases of academic dishonesty. Students would have to opt to have their cases heard by this second academic board.
As of now, it remains unclear how an honor code would be integrated with some of the Ad Board Review Committee’s recommendations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an open letter released Monday, leaders of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers heralded—with a distinct note of optimism—the union’s eighth round of contract negotiations with University management.
The letter, which emphasized the history of amicable relations between the 5,800-person union and University negotiators, stated that the recent preliminary meetings between both parties have been dominated by an “optimistic spirit.”
“Leaders in our union wanted to say something important about the power of acting in a constructive manner and about our partnership with the University,” said HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger.
In an e-mailed statement, Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin, who often handles labor relations inquiries, wrote that University negotiators remain “optimistic” that their positive working relationship with HUCTW will yield a beneficial agreement for both parties. The current three-year contract expires on June 30, 2010.
“As the letter noted, we are negotiating in a time of constrained resources, and everyone must work together to adjust to the University’s new fiscal reality,” Galvin added.
Despite the reigning spirit of cooperation commencing this year’s round of negotiations, HUCTW and Harvard have not always enjoyed an amicable relationship, said Jaeger, who referenced a “period of intense antagonism” between both groups in the ’90s.
“We’ve learned the importance of cooperation the hard way by having some protacted periods of antagonism,” Jaeger said.
The recent open letter is the second in a series of three communications about the ongoing negotiations between the union and Harvard. The first missive had highlighted concerns regarding staff cutbacks and criticized University adminstrators for the lack of transparency.
HUCTW will release a third open letter in upcoming weeks, featuring the results of a member survey about current working conditions and goals for the future, according to Jaeger. The letter will also include more information on the progress of this year’s negotiations.
HUCTW ratified its first contract with Harvard in 1989 after a protracted struggle to gain recognition from the University.

Responding to University President Drew G. Faust’s call for input on the ongoing search to replace Harvard Business School Dean Jay O. Light, student and alumni have stressed the importance of building the school’s global presence and staying relevant going forward.
Faust intends to appoint Light’s successor by the end of the academic year, when he will step down after leading the school for five years, during which time he shepherded the Business School through last year’s budget cuts and the completion of a $600 million capital campaign.
Led by Ann M. Kelly, president of the school’s alumni association, the Business School Alumni Board stressed in an open letter published last month the importance of maintaining the school’s global brand and adapting to the “ever changing world” to stay relevant.
“A new Dean will face the very difficult challenge of leading forward an institution steeped in history and tradition in a future world that may not value our current core competencies,” Kelly wrote.
Kelly added in an interview with The Crimson yesterday that alumni recognize the ongoing challenge of addressing the “changing dynamic of the business school education.”
“A lot more people are not going back to school for an MBA,” Kelly said. “How do we make sure the next 100 years are as successful if not more so than the last 100? It’s a tall order certainly.”
The alumni open letter follows a public endorsement published online Jan. 31 by eight members of the Class of 2009, who urged Faust to name Business School professor Nitin Nohria as Light’s successor.
Praising Nohria’s questioning attitude and visionary outlook, the students pointed to their experience working with him to lead the MBA Oath movement, a pledge to act ethically in the business world taken by over 1900 students at business schools across the country starting last year.
“Professor Nohria is focused on all aspects of the school,” said Jessica R. Schmidt, a member of the Class of 2009 who worked on the endorsement letter. “He is not only interested in maintaining the image of the school, but also doing real work to make HBS an even better institution.”
Nohria declined to comment on the endorsement at this time.
Late last month, Faust met with a group of approximately 20 Business School students to discuss their concerns, which ranged from improving inter-school coordination—specifically difficulties in cross-registering for courses at the University’s other graduate schools—to expanding international academic opportunities, according to M. Scott Daubin, Harvard Business School Student Association co-president.
Faust said in a Feb. interview with The Crimson that she has also been meeting with faculty members and leaders at other business schools to discuss challenges the new dean will face.
“This is a time of a lot of discussion about what business education should be,” Faust said.

Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow was confirmed by the Senate last week to be appointed to the board of the Legal Services Corporation, the country’s largest provider of civil legal aid for the poor.
John G. Levi, a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm and a 1972 Law School graduate, was also confirmed during the Senate committee session. Gloria Valencia-Weber, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and a 1986 Law School graduate, awaits confirmation.
Minow, Levi, and Valencia-Weber were all nominated by the Obama administration last August.
“President Obama has honored me with the oppotunity to serve the country by ensuring vital legal assistance for millions of Americans who cannot afford it,” Minow said in a Law School press release.
“We are all very honored and humbled to be able to serve in helping people to access the justice system,” Levi said. “[Minow] knows so much about this field. She’ll just be terrific.”
Minow’s comprehensive view of law and society will be an asset to the board, according to Stephen Barr, the corporation’s director of media relations.
The board, which changes with each presidency, is comprised of 11 members, six of which can be members of the current administration’s party. “The board strives to be a bipartisan body that works by consensus,” Barr said.
The current board members are a mix of academics and practitioners. Barr said he assumes the White House “looks at people who are interested in legal aid to the poor in drawing up the board.”
“If you’re a lawyer and you have been working in your community for a long time, then you certainly know how important access to justice is for our fellow Americans,” Levi said.
According to Levi, each nominee had to undergo a thorough vetting process by the White House and the FBI before being confirmed by the Senate. Levi said he answered the committee’s questions in writing and in discussions with Senators.
Though the board, which meets throughout the year and is expected to oversee all of the corporation’s work, requires a significant amount of time, Barr said he believes the new committment will not affect Minow’s ability to fulfill her duties at HLS.
“I will expect that the dean will be working a lot of weekends. She will lose some Saturdays to serve the public interest,” he said.
Valencia-Weber would not comment prior to her confirmation.

Next fall, some students fulfilling the Science of the Physical Universe General Education requirement may conclude lectures with a taste test rather than a pop quiz if they enroll in a new course entitled “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter.”
Professors from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences teamed up with Spanish chefs Jose Andrés and Ferran Adriá to design a curriculum that explores physical and chemical principles in a unique way.
“It is, in the end, a science course, but it’s science that you learn with a purpose,” said one of the course’s creators, physics professor David A. Weitz. “Food is something we all need, all eat, all enjoy—so why not connect science with food?”
A new chef will lecture alongside the professors every week, and cooking demonstrations during class will correlate with scientific topics. For instance, students will learn about heat processing from a chocolatier, study complex phase changes by frying eggs, and explore fermentation by learning about wine, beer, and cheese.
The guest chefs will also hold lectures open to the Harvard community each Monday.
“What is unusual about this group of chefs is that they really use science in their cooking,” said Michael P. Brenner, a professor of applied math and applied physics who helped create the course. “Many of the things they’re renowned for are figuring out how to exploit the scientific properties of food.”
Adriá’s work is a prime example of the intersection between science and cooking, Weitz said. His restaurant El Bulli is only open six months a year; he spends the other six researching culinary science in a lab in Barcelona. Weitz added that El Bulli is so popular that reservation applications are only accepted one day a year and it is more difficult to make a reservation at El Bulli than to get into Harvard.
SEAS postdoctoral fellow Otger Campás-Rigau first suggested the course after hearing a speech by Adriá at Harvard in 2008. In designing the curriculum, Weitz and Campás-Rigau consulted the Fundación Alicia, a Barcelona-based nonprofit headed by Adriá that focuses on innovation in kitchen science.
After meeting with many of the chefs earlier this week in Barcelona, Campás-Rigau said that the chefs and the scientists are equally excited to learn about one another’s professions.
However, Weitz anticipates that it will be challenging to coordinate his teaching with the chefs’ because “our languages are very different.” This language barrier goes beyond just a difference in professions—many of the chefs do not speak English and will require translators.
“These chefs are the closest to rock stars of anyone I’ve ever met,” Weitz said. “This is such a unique opportunity that I’m hoping students won’t mind too much.”
Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen said the course “exemplifies the Gen Ed ideals of helping students make connections between the classroom and the rest of their lives.”
Weitz said he believes that “if we’re successful at making the science as interesting as the cooking, then we’ll have a successful course.”

In recognition of the social impact of their investigative reporting, select journalists were presented with the annual Goldsmith Awards in a ceremony last night.
The Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting, two Goldsmith Book Prizes, and the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism were awarded last night in a ceremony hosted by the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics, and Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government.
The Goldsmith Awards Program, which was established in 1991, honors journalistic works that promote change in government conduct and public policy.
The two Book Prize winners were Matthew S. Hindman, for “The Myth of Digital Democracy,” and former Shorenstein Fellow John M. Hamilton, for “A History of American Foreign Reporting.”
The career award went to Frontline Executive Producer David Fanning, who delivered the keynote address and described his vision for Frontline and the future of broadcast journalism.
The investigative reporting prize went to Raquel Rutledge of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel for her year-long series “Cashing in on Kids.” Rutledge’s articles exposed the corruption and fraud in Wisconsin’s child care program, leading to the passage of new laws aimed at eliminating criminal activities in the daycare business.
“As these stories circulate, [the everyday people] can realize that they can make a difference—not journalists, but the people that come forward,” Rutledge said in an interview with The Crimson. “The sources for my stories are people who risked their careers and livelihoods to tell their stories. So the credit goes to them.”
Alison M. Kommer, coordinator of the Goldsmith Awards and staff assistant at the Shorenstein Center, said that the judges considered criteria such as “suitability, degree of difficulty in investigative reporting, execution, and actual and potential impact on public policy in the United States” as they evaluated the works of journalism.
Funded by an annual grant from the Goldsmith Fund of the Greenfield Foundation, the award program provides cash prizes of $5,000 and $25,000 to the winners of the Goldsmith Book Prize and Investigative Reporting Prize, respectively.
The winners and finalists of the awards are scheduled to participate in the Goldsmith Seminar, “The Present and Future of Investigative Reporting,” at HKS today.

Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow joined four other law school deans in advocating for the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy in a letter sent to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees last week.
“‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ directly obstructs our efforts, preventing some of our best and brightest from serving their country in the Armed Forces,” the deans wrote in their letter. “Discharging gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members merely because of their sexual orientation is never justified.”
Robert Greenwald, senior clinical instructor of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Law Clinic at HLS, said that he thinks the letter reflects the perspective of the majority of Americans today.
“In the past there may have been more of a range of views—in the Law School and in the American public—but over the past years people have gained a better understanding of the rights for the gay and lesbian community,” Greenwald said.
Also signing the letter were the deans of University of California, Berkeley School of Law, Stanford Law School, Yale Law School, and New York University School of Law.
The letter is the latest in the University’s ongoing criticism of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and raises the question of whether ROTC will be allowed to return to campus if President Barack Obama’s carries out his promise to repeal the policy.
In response to the policy, military recruiters were temporarily banned from the Law School's campus until a 2006 Supreme Court ruling upheld the Solomon Amendment, which prevents universities from receiving federal funding if they do not allow the military to recruit on campus. Currently the University refuses to officially acknowledge ROTC programs.
According to Paul E. Mawn ’63, chairman of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC, the organization is seeking official recognition for ROTC on campus with or without the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
“As far as Harvard is concerned, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” is irrelevant because it is the law of the land and was passed by a Democratic government,” Mawn said.
According to Greenwald, regardless of military restrictions, schools and universities have an obligation to make their campuses safe places for diversity.
As long as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” remains in place, allowing military recruiters on campus would violate the University’s antidiscrimination policy, Greenwald said.
Greenwald and Mawn expressed different views about who is discriminated against under the status quo.
According to Greenwald, “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” prevents people from making their own decisions about military service, but Mawn said he believes the university’s policies discriminate against students who want to serve in ROTC.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 21, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 24 news article "Minow Joins Protest of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' incorrectly stated that military recruiters were currently banned from Harvard's campus. In fact, in response to the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, military recruiters were temporarily banned from the Law School's campus until 2006.

Not all fats are created equal, according to recent research at the Harvard School of Public Health.
A study published yesterday in PLoS Medicine and led by Dariush Mozaffarian, an assistant professor of epidemiology at HSPH, showed that replacing saturated fats with a higher than previously recommended percentage of polyunsaturated fats was associated with a significantly decreased risk of coronary heart disease, the leading killer of adults in developing countries.
Poor diet is a risk factor of coronary heart disease, and this study provides quantifiable support for the long-accepted claim that saturated fats in particular can make a person more susceptible to the disease.
According to Mozaffarin, dietary recommendations had been “to reduce total fat intake” because of its link to heart disease.
“Implicitly the message was that all fat is bad and that saturated fat is particularly bad,” he said.
Mozaffarian and his team, which included HSPH researchers Sarah Wallace and Renata Micha, examined the results of several randomized clinical trials of participants who increased their intake of polyunsaturated fats for a year.
Meta-analysis showed participants had a 19 percent reduced risk of coronary heart disease compared to a control group. This means that with each five percent increase in the proportion of calories from polyunsaturated fats, there was a ten percent decrease in coronary heart disease episodes. They also found that a diet made up of 15 percent polyunsaturated fats was more effective at reducing risk than a diet with the previously recommended ten percent.
By encouraging the replacement of saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats and by increasing the percentage of calories that can be allocated to polyunsaturated fats, Mozaffarian said the study’s results are relevant to both industry and individuals.
Mozaffarian said that people often replace fat with carbohydrates. Food producers also frequently substitute saturated fat for trans fat—both of which have detrimental effects.
“The replacement nutrient hasn’t received any attention,” he said.
Mozaffarian said it generally takes ten to twenty years for new research to influence guidelines and for those guidelines to reach public consciousness. Frank B. Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at HSPH, said this study could begin the “paradigm shift” to focus on “quality of fat” instead of just the quantity.

A year after Harvard’s endowment plummeted 27 percent—losing almost $11 billion—University President Drew G. Faust told reporters in Shanghai last week that she expects a better year for the University’s coffers.
Speaking at the newly opened Harvard Center Shanghai, Faust hinted that as the world’s financial markets begin to recover from last year’s deep recession, the University’s endowment will begin to show gains as well.
“We have been very pleased to see the general rise in the markets and to feel that there has been a far better year in fiscal ’10 than there was in fiscal ’09 for all investors across the United States,” Faust said.
She also expressed confidence in Harvard Management Company chief Jane L. Mendillo, who leads the University’s endowment managers. Mendillo, who stepped into her position in July 2008, has taken steps to place Harvard on stronger financial footing, such as increasing cash holdings to deleverage the endowment.
According to its most recent report, HMC decreased capital commitments by $3 billion and restructured the policy portfolio to include a positive cash position starting in fiscal year 2009.
“We have great confidence in Jane,” Faust said. “We think she has made important adjustments to many of the approaches that she takes to investment.”
In October 2009, the University paid $500 million to exit interest-rate swaps which were intended to reduce risk in the financing of the University’s expansion into Allston, which is now on hold. The swaps failed after interest rates dropped to unprecedented lows during the recession.

Over the weekend, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team lost to Brown, 13-11, marking the Crimson’s eighth straight defeat to Ivy rivals Brown, Cornell, and Princeton.
But an even more improbable streak was extended during the loss to the Bears.  Sophomore attack Jeff Cohen scored four goals to lead Harvard and had two goals and an assist earlier in the week in a win against Colgate.  This performance earned Cohen New England Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association Player of the Week honors, his second such award of his career.
Avid Crimson fans will remember Cohen for his three goals and an assist that led Harvard to an upset victory over then No. 5 Duke in the first collegiate game of his career. What people may not know is that Cohen has recorded a point in every single game of his career—a 19-game streak that is tied for the longest active streak in the nation.
During the scoring streak Cohen has recorded 50 goals and 10 assists for 60 points, the most points of any Crimson player during a 19-game stretch. Cohen led Harvard last season with 34 goals and currently leads the team this season with 16.
With the Crimson averaging 12 goals per game this season and Cohen averaging just above three points per game for his career, it’s hard to predict when this streak could end. Look for it to likely hit 20 games this weekend against a Dartmouth squad that will be tired from consecutive road games this week against ACC powerhouses North Carolina and Duke.

Just two weeks ago, the Harvard men’s volleyball team hosted Springfield coming off its first victory of the season. But the Pride halted the Crimson’s win streak at a single game, taking the match, 3-0.
Last night, Harvard travelled to Springfield, Mass., riding another one-game winning streak and, once again, Springfield made sure the streak ended there.
Playing at Blake Arena, the Crimson (2-12, 2-1 EIVA Hay Division) was unable to bounce back from an early 2-0 deficit, as the visitors dropped the match to Springfield (13-7, 3-4 EIVA Tait Division), 3-1.
Despite being outscored by 14 points in the first two sets, Harvard mounted a comeback, winning the third set and taking the fourth to the wire.
“We found some energy,” co-captain Erik Kuld said. “It was definitely a fun match at the end.
In the match’s final set, the Crimson had four opportunities to force a fifth set, but came up short on each attempt.
Harvard’s first set point came with the Crimson holding the 29-28 advantage following a kill from sophomore Nicola Ivica. But the Pride’s Greg Falcone answered with a kill of his own, evening the score at 29.
Harvard found itself up by a point a second time, this time courtesy of a Springfield attack error. But the Pride’s next attack attempt was successful and the score was knotted once again, this time at 30.
Up 32-31, the Crimson looked to close out the set with freshman Rob Lothman behind the service line. Springfield managed to control the serve, and then set up Eric Shoemaker for the kill.
Harvard took back the lead, going up 34-33 after a block from Ivica and senior Soren Rosier. But the Pride managed to hold on one last time, getting another kill from Palumbo to regain the momentum.
AJ Nally gave Springfield the lead for good, finishing off a set from Eric Shoemaker to take the 36-35 lead.
The Pride closed out the match following an attack error from sophomore Matt Jones.
“We had several opportunities to capture the set,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “In the end we couldn’t close out. That’s what it comes down to.”
Despite the disappointing ending for the Crimson, Harvard managed to improve on its previous matchup against Springfield, in which the team was unable to take a set from its opponents.
Last night, the Crimson used its familiarity with its opponent to take the third set.
“We were a bit more familiar with what was going to come at us,” Kuld said. “We did work on blocking a certain play that they do a lot of. I think it paid off.”
Harvard closed out the third set using a 5-0 run to overcome a 29-26 deficit. Ivica got the run started, working off a set from Lothman to come away with the kill. Three straight Pride attack errors put the Crimson ahead, 30-29.
Kuld captured the set for Harvard, notching a kill for the 31-29 victory.
But it was too little too late, as the Crimson was unable to dig itself out of the early 2-0 deficit.
Ivica led Harvard for the second-straight game, finishing with 19 kills and nine digs.
“[Ivica’s] really playing out of his head right now,” Kuld said. “He’s really found his rhythm, and it’s fun to watch.”
Despite picking up its 11th non-conference loss of the season, the Crimson maintains its position in third place in the division standings and primed to make a splash in conference play. With a victory over NYU (3-13, 0-4 EIVA Hay Division) this Saturday, Harvard could vault into the second spot in its division.
“We know Saturday’s going to be a huge game for us,” Weintraub said. “We know that we still have opportunities to succeed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
T. S. Eliot may have believed that April is the cruelest month, but hundreds of collegiate athletes would disagree. While March brings madness, it also brings heartbreak for nearly every team in the country.
The Harvard women’s hockey team is no stranger to March heartache. It has made runs to the national championship game and been stopped on the doorstep of the NCAA field. But each of the last nine Marches has brought the same thing—a season-ending playoff loss.
This season was no exception for the Crimson. After being bounced in the ECAC semifinals by Clarkson, Harvard held on for home-ice advantage in the NCAA quarterfinals.
On a quiet campus on the eve of spring break, the Crimson welcomed Cornell to Bright Hockey Center in a game that pitted an established powerhouse against an upstart squad making its first tournament appearance.
This time, it was Cinderella’s turn to shine. The Big Red jumped out to a 5-0 lead, cruised to a 6-2 win, and carried that momentum into triple overtime of the national title game before finally falling to Minnesota-Duluth.
And so again the Harvard women’s hockey team headed into spring break a little earlier than it had hoped, with the bitter taste of a loss left to stew until next season.
Because that’s the funny thing about March—it has a way of making a five-month season about just three or four games. And while March wasn’t kind to the Crimson this year, the 2010 season is still a body of work that Harvard should be proud of.
If in October you had told me that the Crimson would only play six games with both junior Liza Ryabkina and senior Christina Kessler on the ice and still be one of the nation’s top four teams come March, I would have called you crazy. Of course, if you had told me that Cornell would make the national championship game, I probably would have laughed in your face.
It was a season of surprises in women’s hockey, as three teams made their first-ever NCAA tournament appearances, while three traditional powerhouses—including defending national champion Wisconsin—were absent from the field. But for Harvard, although it again found itself near the top of the ECAC and the national field, there were plenty of pleasant surprises as well.
“Yes, we have a young team, but we didn’t play young—very rarely do we play young,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said after the Cornell loss. “We were banged up at times, but we didn’t play banged up. We were in holes before, and we didn’t play like we were in a hole.”
The biggest of these surprises was the emergence of freshman Laura Bellamy, who was thrust into the net in January when a torn ACL abruptly ended Kessler’s career. Bellamy came into her own down the stretch, finishing with a 1.68 goals-against average and a .921 save percentage in 17 starts.
The highlight of the freshman’s season came in the Beanpot, where she didn’t allow a goal in Harvard’s title run and was named the tournament’s best goaltender. And though Bellamy was lit up in her first NCAA appearance—allowing five goals in a period and a half before being lifted in favor of junior Kylie Stephens—the experience the rookie gained this season puts both her and the Crimson light years ahead of where they thought they would be come next October.
Instead of having an inexperienced netminder to open the season, Harvard will be bringing back a seasoned goalie with playoff experience—an enormous advantage in a league full of strong goaltenders.
Bellamy’s classmates made an impact as well. Defensemen Josephine Pucci and Kelsey Romatoski proved themselves early and often and will be asked to step up to anchor the unit next season.
But most impressive was center Jillian Dempsey, a former U.S. Under-18 national team skater who lived up to the hype in her freshman season. The rookie was 10th in the nation in first-year scoring, racking up 27 points on 11 goals and 16 assists.
It helped that Dempsey spent a good chunk of the year playing alongside juniors Kate Buesser and Ryabkina, who seamlessly stepped into the role of offensive leaders.
After returning from a dislocated knee on Nov. 25, Ryabkina made the most of her abbreviated season by scoring 15 goals in her 24 games—including a four-game outburst in the Beanpot opener that reminded fans of the winger’s mentor, two-time Olympian Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09.
Buesser, on the other hand, came into her own in her third season, quietly scoring 40 points as she came up in the clutch time and time again.
With an experienced junior class that includes Ryabkina, Buesser, and blueliner Leanna Coskren ready to step up and lead a team full of potential next season, the future of Crimson hockey looks bright.
But the efforts of this year's seniors in helping Harvard reach this point cannot be undervalued. Co-captains Kathryn Farni and Cori Bassett, along with classmates Kessler, Randi Griffin, and Anna McDonald, took a team that could have made excuses and turned it into a squad that perhaps exceeded expectations.
“We just have to play the best we can with the cards we’re dealt,” Farni said after the Cornell game. “There were definitely points in the season where we struggled with the adversity that we had, and I think we tried our best to regroup and were focused on what happens on the ice and what was under our control.”
That’s exactly what the senior class did, leading by example as Bassett, Farni, Griffin, and McDonald each came up with her highest point total in a Crimson uniform. Kessler, meanwhile, finishes her career as the all-time Harvard leader in wins and shutouts while holding the NCAA career mark for save percentage (.941).
Of course, it helps when you have the NCAA’s all-time winningest coach behind the bench—which is what Katey Stone became with her squad’s 5-1 win in the ECAC tournament opener. Now the only thing missing from Stone’s illustrious trophy case is an NCAA title.
With the madness of women’s hockey over for this March, the Crimson has a lot to smile about: a Beanpot crown, a return to the national tournament, and a strong foundation for next season. Although it won’t lace up the skates until October, the beginning of Harvard’s next title run doesn’t seem so far away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When one thinks spring break, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Puerto Rico come to mind. But the Harvard women’s soccer team dribbled in another direction, traveling across the Atlantic to Italy last week.
While many of the Crimson’s opponents in the States were taking a reprieve from soccer, Harvard was busy sharpening its skills against some of Europe’s finest players. And with the added perks of exploring a country known for its savory food, timeless architecture, and diehard “football” fans, the team couldn’t go wrong.
A few years ago, the Crimson soccer staff decided that the men’s and women’s squads would go on an international trip every four years. This year marked the women’s turn, a well-deserved reward for the two-time defending Ivy League champions.
“Our coaches were the ones who picked Italy,” explains forward and junior co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh. “We completed the process through a company called XL Tours. They were really great about working with us to pick out the exact cities we wanted to visit.”
But there was one major obstacle separating the Harvard women from their dreams of cannolis, gondola rides, and top-notch European soccer—money.
Although the Crimson gained financial assistance from Friends of Harvard Soccer, the burden of paying for the trip rested largely with the team.
The women responded to this challenge as they would to any other on the soccer field. With a little creativity and a lot of hustle, they managed to raise the necessary funds.
“Our main source [of revenue] was selling our Ivy League Champions t-shirts,” Sheeleigh says. “Then we had some players work at a swim meet to make extra money. We also held an event at Uno’s Grill one night, where all of the proceeds went to the Harvard women’s soccer team.”
The team’s tireless efforts were well worth it, as the trip was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for all those involved.
Harvard kicked off the trip in style, heading to a professional AC Milan soccer game its first night to witness the skills of none other than David Beckham.
“It’s a shame that Beckham’s injured now,” Crimson coach Ray Leone says. “He was just getting back to playing his normal position at center midfield. Our team was present for what may have been the last good professional game of his career.”
During its stay, the squad visited Milan, Florence, Venice, Lake Como, and San Marino, a small independent republic located in the Apennine Mountains. Members of the team also took time out of their soccer schedule to go shopping, eat in quaint local cafes, bike ride in Milan, and go paddle boating in Lake Como.
“There were just so many unforgettable moments on this trip,” senior defender Lizzy Nichols says. “Whether it was hiking through the streets of Milan or climbing up to the top of a famous cathedral in Florence, we all had such an invaluable experience.”
Adventurous excursions aside, it was business as usual for Harvard, as the women took the field for exhibition contests against three Italian teams—ASD Mozzanica, ACF Firenze, and Cervia. The Crimson lost a hard-fought match to Cervia but picked up 2-1 wins against Mozzanica and Firenze.
As expected, matching up with the different tempo and style of play of international opponents had its challenges for the Crimson.
“[The Italian teams] were more direct in terms of goal scoring,” Nichols says. “They hit the ball out of the air a lot more. They were fast, strong, and all very skillful on an individual level.”
The opposition also applied unfamiliar tactics usually absent from the American collegiate circuit, such as marking man-on-man and deliberately pulling players offside.
But there were also aspects in which the players feel the Crimson had an edge.
“My impression was that we had a more tactically cohesive team,” Nichols observes. “I was also struck by how silent the other teams were. Usually, we try to communicate a lot on the field, but we really didn’t hear that coming from the other side.”
And it simply wouldn’t be an international soccer match without a little controversy.
“The officiating was interesting in each of the games,” Leone says. “One game was especially funny—the referees just decided to add four minutes to the game clock [for no apparent reason].”
All things considered, competing in Italy has now given the Crimson distinct advantages right as it prepares to enter the spring.
“Because of the trip, we were able to get in five extra practices and three extra games,” Leone says. “It’s nice that even before we enter spring training, we already have that under our belt.”
Though the players appreciate further honing their skills, they are equally grateful for getting to bond with old and new friends on the team.
“Trust and comfort in relationships translate onto the field,” Nichols stresses. “A healthier team community will open up doors for success. Mostly, I’ll remember and value this trip not so much for Italy, but because I got to spend it with my friends.”

For the first one and a half games of the 2010 season, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team got a taste of something it can look forward to in 2011: the presence of two dominant scorers on the field at the same time.
But just when the Crimson found the perfect person to assume the role of sidekick to junior attacker Jess Halpern—last season’s Ivy League scoring leader—Halpern sustained a season-ending injury.
Now, instead of racking up easy scores as defenses focus their attention on Halpern, freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen has been the one receiving the extra attention.
Facing double teams or no double teams, VanderMeulen has found a way to reach the back of the net in each of her team’s six matches, leading her team with 20 goals. If VanderMeulen continues at the pace she’s on now, the rookie will easily eclipse Halpern’s total of 46 goals a season ago.
But what Harvard is most excited about is getting these two prolific scorers on the field at the same time. Unfortunately for the Crimson, it will have to wait another year.

With 41 varsity sports, it seems like every athlete at Harvard should be able to find his or her calling in the athletic department. But senior Daniel Oshima has looked for success in other places—and he’s found it.
Oshima, a member of the school’s club judo team, won a national title at the National Collegiate Judo Championship earlier this month in the 73kg division. Also making the trip to Colorado Springs was sophomore Amaury Berzin, who placed third among novices in the 81kg division.
Oshima, a native of Somerville, Mass. who practices at the Tohuku Judo Club, won the country’s top prize just a year after finishing third. The senior was also awarded the Outstanding Male Competitor prize and singlehandedly led the Crimson to a third-place finish among senior men’s teams.
Judo is a martial art that originated in Japan and became an Olympic sport in 1964. Although the sport’s name translates to “the gentle way,” it involves throws, pins, and even different choking techniques.
It seems that the sport may run in Oshima’s blood, as his older brother Michael ’09 took home a national title of his own at last year’s competition.
To read more about Oshima’s work with the Harvard Self Defense Club, check out this column, and look for a full feature on Oshima’s accomplishment next week!

Harvard launched its own channel yesterday on iTunes U, a part of the online store that provides largely free access to educational materials. It joined other educational heavyweights distributing knowledge to the masses.
As of this afternoon, the majority of the material posted on the channel consisted of informational videos and recordings of public lectures and  events. Overscheduled Harvard students can now watch John F. Kennedy  Forum events as a means of procrastination.
The new channel also provides access to Michael Sandel's collaboration with PBS, the 12 episode version of his massively popular course, Moral Reasoning 22: Justice. And it's free!
Along with Sandel's erudition, you can also find an enlightening podcast from the Kuumba singers on how to join their e-mail list.
But administrators say they plan to expand the channel's offerings to include more lectures. Currently, only Justice is available.
"For the launch we focused  primarily on public events and lectures," Perry Hewitt, the  University's director of digital communications and communications services, wrote in an e-mail. "We will be adding more content, including some lectures, in the coming months and we hope to add more in the future by working with people across Harvard's schools, institutes, and centers."
Other universities  offer a wide selection of courses on their iTunes U channels with audio recordings on a whole host of topics. Yale, for example, offers courses like "The American Novel since 1945", "Introduction to Political Philsophy," and a course on Milton. MIT also outshines Harvard as far as online course offerings go. Our nerdy neighbor offers a range of complicated sounding science courses.
Here's  to hoping Harvard catches up.

Residents of Cabot and Currier will no longer have to decide whether they want to trek back to the Quad for sustenance, grab a meal from FlyBy for lunch, or struggle to find a House along the River in which they are welcome to eat.
Recently a number of Houses have instituted dining hall restrictions making it difficult for many quadlings to find a place to eat. But now Currier and Cabot, like their neighbor Pfoho, have places to eat along the River where they won't be turned away.
Cabot residents  will be allowed to bypass the interhouse restrictions in Kirkland and Lowell,  and Currier residents will have carte blanche to eat in Eliot and Winthrop.
Lowell House Master Diana Eck wrote in an e-mail that all of the House masters  agreed to the new partnering among the houses “as a matter of fairness.”  House Committee Co-Chairs from several of the houses involved said that they did not know that this plan was in the  works until they were informed by their House Masters of the decision.
Residents of Pforzheimer House have been exempt from the  dining restrictions at Adams House since 1999, when Pfoho emerged victorious in  a war between the two houses. After waiting 11 years, Cabot and Currier will now receive the same right to eat along  the river—without ever doing battle for the privilege.

When it comes to exercising on a daily basis, sixty is the new thirty.
According to a recent Harvard Medical School study, women now need to exercise 60 minutes a day to avoid gaining weight in middle age. Paired with a normal diet, these extra minutes can prevent those unwanted pounds that seem to pile on with each passing year.
I-Min Lee, an associate professor in the Department of Epidemiology at HMS and the study’s head researcher, notes that the exercise doesn’t have to be vigorous. Walking, light biking, and babysitting are all sufficient ways to get blood flowing.
While students at Harvard have a long way until their fifties, exercise has its benefits now. After all, even college students can attest to unwanted weight gain. Freshman fifteen, anyone? With classes, extra-curriculars, and jobs, it can be difficult to squeeze another hour into our already over-crowded schedules.
For those of us who aren’t dedicated enough to head to the gym every single day, perhaps moving to the quad is another option (more distance to classes maybe?).
