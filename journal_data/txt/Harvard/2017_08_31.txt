After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is part two in a series of op-eds by members of Harvard student groups welcoming the Class of 2021 to campus.
It’s difficult to find the right words to explain what it’s like to be a Latinx student at Harvard. If we had to pick just one, “complicated” might be the word.
For many of you, coming to Harvard means leaving tight knit families held together by a combination of siblings, parents, tios, tias, grandparents, and cousins. It means it’ll be a few months before you can once again sit with them at your favorite restaurant. And you might miss a few birthdays, carne asadas, cook outs, Latinx music, and parties with pupusas, tamales, fresh tacos, and ceviche.
Some of us grew up in primarily Latinx communities, where classmates and friends looked like us. Some of us were one of a handful of Latinx students at our high school. At home, people might have spoken Spanish, English, Portuguese, or a sweet combination of these. Our politics lay scattered across a wide spectrum. Your citizenship statuses will be different and sometimes complex.
These mixed, seemingly contradictory pieces come together to form your Latinidad. You are Latinx, but that means different things for each of you.  
When you get to campus, you’ll grapple with this identity. You’ll deal with what it means to be unlike so many of your peers, to come from a wildly different background, and to look at the world from different perspectives. It may be difficult. You might miss home; you might miss your communities. It will not always be easy, but you will thrive even if this institution was not built for you.
It may take you a while and there will be bumps in the road, but you will learn to navigate this place. There are walls to be broken down and bridges to be built, but you will eventually find your path. Luckily, if you take a panorama of the Latinx familia at Harvard, you will find the many colors, stories, and struggles that make us who we are. There are thousands of other Latinx Harvard students who have trekked ahead of you.
The hard work you’ve put into gaining admission will be your strength. It’s the same strength, or fuerza, your family members embodied as they worked countless hours, in the courtroom, the hospital, the restaurant, the supermarket, the classroom, the office, at home, and anywhere else, to provide for you. Though we come from different backgrounds, our strength and a desire to do better for ourselves is our strength—our Fuerza Latinx.
This Fuerza Latinx is noticeable among our community that has people helping out their families back home, fighting for social change, pursuing medical careers, doing original research, learning how to write music, and so much more.  You might have heard the slogans “Si Se Puede” or “Adelante” before, and you will hear them again. You can inspire change and can open this institution to more Latinx students. Change is gradual, but it does come.
Fuerza Latina, Latinas Unidas, The Latino Men’s Collective, Concilio Latino, and other Latinx organizations are continuously working on paving a path forward, together. By promoting community within and amongst our groups, we hope a common purpose becomes self-evident—the creation of a community where our differences become secondary, if not our strength, as we seek a greater purpose of unity and the growth of our family.
Our family, like any family, is a tree—although we have many branches that grow in different directions, each branch shares the same root, and those roots are our heritage. We invite you to join us in making these branches grow together, to make our family bigger and stronger, so that our community can last and benefit ourselves and our posterity. Your mere presence at this university is revolutionary, and “la lucha sigue,” the fight continues.
We are so glad to welcome you into these gleaming iron gates.
Edgar Gonzalez Jr. ’19, president of the Latino Men’s Collective, is a Government concentrator in Cabot House. Anshi Moreno Jimenez, president of Latina Unidas, is a social studies concentrator in Currier House. Ruben E. Reyes Jr., a Crimson editorial chair and co-chair of Concilio Latino, is a History and Literature concentrator in Leverett House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College has named Roland S. Davis as the next associate dean for diversity and inclusion, ending a national search to fill the position that began nearly a year ago in fall 2016.
Davis, who spent his undergraduate years at Bates College before earning graduate degrees from Boston College and the University of New Hampshire, succeeds Emelyn A. dela Peña, who left Harvard for Washington University in St. Louis last October.
Dela Peña was the first Office of Student Life administrator to serve as the College’s dean for diversity—a role, created in 2014, that involves overseeing the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard College Women’s Center, as well as creating opportunities to increase diversity on campus.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced Davis’s appointment in an email sent to Harvard administrators Wednesday morning.
Davis “brings to Harvard a deep and nuanced understanding of the social, cultural, and psychological factors that impact communities around the issues of diversity and inclusion,” she wrote.
Before coming to Harvard, Davis worked in various administrative positions at Bates and at Simmons College. In her email, O’Dair wrote that he was “a catalyst for change on issues of diversity and inclusion” at both schools, and added she hopes Davis will be a “thought leader” on these matters at Harvard.
Davis did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
The search for a new College dean for diversity has been ongoing since dela Peña’s departure. A search committee selected three finalists for the position in April 2017 and invited the trio of candidates to campus, where they met with various officials and participated in a “confidential student forum,” answering questions about the job from a handful of undergraduates.
O’Dair said at the time that the College hoped to make a final decision about the position by the beginning of the summer.
Davis arrives at Harvard at a time of broader administrative shakeup. Several University officials—many of whom worked to increase diversity on campus—have left the school for other jobs in the past year, including former University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, former Chief Diversity Officer Lisa M. Coleman, and former director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Alicia Oeser.
Davis’s appointment also coincides with the implementation of Harvard’s year-old historic penalties on members of single-gender social organizations. Those sanctions—which, starting with the Class of 2021, bar members of these groups from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships—took effect when the current class of freshmen arrived on campus earlier this month.
During her time as dean for diversity, dela Peña worked closely with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on developing Harvard’s social group penalties, in particular assisting in Khurana’s negotiations with single-gender social organizations.
Though the sanctions are controversial among students and faculty, dela Peña has said her decision to leave Harvard several months later in August 2016 had “nothing to do” with the College’s attempts to regulate undergraduate social life or its critical reception.
In her email Wednesday, O’Dair also announced that the College has named Robin M. Johnson to fill the position of “Director of Diversity Education and Support.” Johnson, an academic counselor for the Bureau of Study Counsel, replaces Loc Truong, the College’s former director of diversity and inclusion programs who departed Harvard for MIT in May. Harvard will host a welcoming event for Davis and Johnson in October, O’Dair wrote.
Davis will officially start work on October 2, and Johnson on September 11.

UPDATED: August 31, 2017 at 12:22 p.m.
Blue Cross Blue Shield now covers pharmaceutical costs for students enrolled in Harvard’s health care plan, a change that will be more expensive for some students.
On July 28, students enrolled in Harvard’s health plan received an email from Harvard University Health Services advising students that they might pay different fees under the new company. The shift has drawn criticism from some graduate students.
According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, HUHS switched to Blue Cross Blue Shield because that company already oversaw students’ primary care. The University decided to put the pharmacy component of the health plan under the same company’s control in an effort to better integrate coverage.
The new health coverage has resulted in price changes for some drugs. Blue Cross Blue Shield classifies certain drugs differently than Harvard’s old provider, meaning that some drugs will be more expensive under the new plan while others will be cheaper. deLuzuriaga said that 93 percent of prescriptions would cost the same or be cheaper under the new plan.
“Most members will not experience a difference in how their prescription drug medications are covered; however, some members may experience a change in co-payment or coverage for certain medications,” the email reads.
Some students said they were frustrated by the price increase.
“I was very surprised recently to discover that the cost of my dependent health care had gone up by $400 a semester,” said Scott Collier, a Ph.D. candidate involved in graduate unionization efforts. “This represents a highly non-trivial and unexpected increase in cost.”
Collier and other graduate students criticized a statement Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng made last semester promising, “there will be no reductions to any current student benefits, including health insurance.” GSAS has faced financial difficulties after negative endowment returns last fiscal year.
“The cost of these particular prescription medications had nearly doubled in cost,” said Jake Gable, a Ph.D. candidate. “It feels like this is a change in our benefits.”
In an email, GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote, “GSAS continues to cover 100% of the HUHS Student Health Fee (SHF) and the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) for PhD students receiving financial aid.”
In response to changes to the health plan, Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers sent a letter to GSAS deans.
In the letter, union organizers and supporters criticized GSAS for the price increases, arguing that these price increases are particularly taxing given the smaller than usual increase in student stipends for the 2017-2018 academic year. In the spring of 2017, Dean Meng announced that graduate students’ stipends would increase by 1.5 percent, compared to the usual 3 percent.
“The university continues to make harmful changes to our wages and benefits with no input from students and with little notice to the students who are affected by these significant changes,” they wrote. “These increases in healthcare costs represent a sizable reduction in benefits for many students, which Dean Meng specifically claimed would not occur in his email of March 29. We urge you to keep Dean Meng’s word.”
In a statement, deLuzuriaga wrote that some students were consulted before HUHS changed the health care plan.
“Health plan benefit changes are vetted through the Student Health Planning Committee, which includes students, staff, and policy experts from across the University,” she wrote.
The union’s criticism of health plan changes comes as the University and HGSU-UAW await an NLRB decision about student unionization at Harvard. After a National Labor Relations Board official ruled that a 2016 unionization election—which initially showed that students voted against unionizing—should be invalidated, Harvard appealed to the national NLRB in Washington, D.C. If the board rejects Harvard’s appeal, undergraduate teaching fellows and graduate teaching fellows and research assistants will head to the polls to vote for a second time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates bid their final farewell to summer Wednesday as they crowded classrooms and lecture halls on the College’s first day of classes.
Though some classes consistently popular with students, like Economics 10a: “Principles of Economics” and Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics,” received expectedly high turnouts, others not as well known also drew large numbers.
Some faculty speculated that such courses, including Government 1510: “American Constitutional Law” and Government 1790: “American Foreign Policy,” attracted crowds because of the tense national political climate.
“Particularly with everything that is going on in the world, people want to know more about how American foreign policy is formulated,” said Government assistant professor Joshua D. Kertzer, who teaches Government 1790.
Kertzer added that his Emerson Hall classroom had seating for only 72 students, but approximately 170 visited to shop the course. He plans to attempt to accommodate all the students who wish to enroll.
“The plan is now to find a bigger classroom and hire more teaching fellows, and just roll with the punches,” he said.
Richard H. Fallon, a Law School professor who teaches Government 1510, said the large turnout in his course may be due to increased interest in the U.S. Constitution.
“If you want to speculate, we seem to be in a political climate in which we lurch from one looming constitutional crisis to the next,” Fallon said. “That may have piqued people’s interest.”
Myer J. Johnson-Potter ’20 said that the current political climate—and the Trump administration’s legal controversies—motivated him to shop Fallon’s course.
“Given the times we’re in, I think it’s very important to understand the constitutional checks and balances that exist on the Trump administration,” he said.
Both instructors, however, added that they never know what exactly contributes to annual changes in student turnout. Kerzter said that since Government 1790 had not been offered since spring 2016, students may have been particularly eager to take the course.
For Jaspreet “Jazz” Kaur ’20, who shopped a Kennedy School course called “Race, Inequality, and American Democracy,” the choice to attend stemmed from an interest in politics and identity. The course, though capped at 60 students, drew dozens more on Wednesday afternoon.
“I’m trying to take a course on immigration and deportation considering the national crisis going on in this country,” Kaur said.  “I’m trying to look for something that really resonates with what is going on in this country and trying to get a framework from the past.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ShopCrimson, a student-run business that delivers dorm room supplies, aims to give the University's dominant student corporation some competition this year.
Launched by a group of sophomores this summer, the start-up sells packages of bottled water, paper towels, tissues, and pre-packaged ramen noodles, among other merchandise. Ming Ying ’20, a founder of ShopCrimson, said he came up with the idea for the business with his freshman-year roommate in April.
“We felt like the delivery options available to Harvard students right now were incredibly expensive and limited,” Ying said. “We sell it to you for literally the same price that you would be buying it from a store like CVS. The benefit, obviously, is that it is delivered to your doorstep.”
Matthew “Teddy” T. Brokaw ’18 said he recently bought a pack of 40 water bottles from ShopCrimson. He’d previously used Harvard Student Agencies, a student-run corporation that maintains a close relationship with the University, to purchase his water.
A 501c(3) nonprofit, HSA employs hundreds of Harvard students and earns millions in revenue from its 14 agencies.
Brokaw said he prefers the start-up ShopCrimson to its competitor.
“I hate HSA,” he said. “It’s a low-quality service at a very high price and I would be willing to buy from virtually any other company on Earth if I had an alternative to HSA, and now finally there is an alternative to HSA.”
In an emailed statement, Angelina R. Massa ’18, president of Harvard Student Agencies, said that the campus delivery service is aware of ShopCrimson, but does not know many details about the business.
“Water and other deliveries are logistically complicated businesses,” Massa said in an emailed response to Brokaw’s and Ying’s statements. “We continually strive to provide quality products and first-rate services to all of our customers.”
While ShopCrimson is moving forward with its orders and current business plan, it could face regulatory hurdles from Harvard administrators.
In April 2013, the College’s Office of Student Life told the operators of student-run delivery service InstaNomz, that  they were in violation of College policy governing business activity on campus. Given the choice between operating as an “outside vendor,” a designation which would have precluded them from delivering straight to students’ doors, and partnering with HSA, InstaNomz folded.
Ying said he is not worried about ShopCrimson suffering a similar fate. He said the business will comply if the College asks them to close or operate as an outside vendor. Administrators from the OSL did not respond to requests for comment.
“We believe there shouldn’t be a monopoly that’s allowed to operate inefficiently and charge students ridiculously high prices to compensate for those inefficiencies,” Ying said. “Obviously, if the administration tells us to do something, there’s really no way to argue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three seats will be open on the Cambridge City Council for the first time in recent memory in this fall's election, opening a door for new faces on a council where turnover is rare.
Cambridge city councillors Nadeem A. Mazen, Leland Cheung, and David P. Maher each announced over the summer that they would not seek reelection this November, opening a third of the seats on the nine-member council. Twenty-six candidates, including six incumbents, have filled out the necessary paperwork and will appear on the ballot this fall.
According to Robert Winters, a local political pundit and historian, it’s been decades since this many seats were available on the council at once.
“It’s a pretty big game changer,” Winters said of the large number of open seats. “My observation has been that when there are multiple open seats it increases the likelihood that you might have an incumbent down. There’s at least an even chance that you might see four new faces on the City Council as a result of this.”
According to current councillor Jan Devereux, who is running for reelection, the bevy of new candidates could reshape majorities on the council and change policy priorities.
“It has the potential to create a new group that collaborates more closely and votes more alike,” Devereux said. “It definitely could have a sizable impact because typically we need five votes, sometimes six, on zoning.”
The number of open seats has increased the number of “credible” candidates and could result in higher voter turnout, according to Winters.
“There's a lot of wild cards and a lot more than in my recollection,” Winters said. “If you look at the number of credible candidates who could actually draw some attention and win it's probably closer to 14, 15, or more—and that's a lot.”
Mazen—who received the highest number of votes of any councillor candidate in the 2015 election—held to his campaign promise of only serving for two terms, announcing in May he would not seek reelection. Speculation arose earlier this summer that Mazen was considering a potential run for Congress against fellow Democrat U.S. Representative Michael Capuano. According to fellow councillor and friend Devereux, Mazen has since reconsidered.
“That news came out a couple of months ago,” Devereux said of her colleague. “I believe he is no longer considering that. I don’t believe he has any immediate plans.”
Mazen did not respond to requests for comment.
Mazen has since thrown his support behind new candidates like sophomore Harvard student and Portland, Ore. native Nadya Okamoto ’20, appearing in a campaign video on the Okamoto campaign’s website. Okamoto has also received an endorsement from Khizr Khan, who rose to prominence during the 2016 presidential election when he condemned then-candidate Donald Trump at the Democratic National Convention.
Cheung, who failed in his run for State Senate last fall, announced in August that he would not seek reelection. In a press release, he thanked the city for the opportunity to serve for eight years.
“It’s time for me to focus on my growing family and opportunities in the private sector,” Cheung wrote.
The salient issues of the campaign this year remain similar to those of years past: affordable housing, zoning laws, and sustainable transportation, among others. Devereux, reflecting on the mass flooding in Houston, Tex., also suggested that voters may be increasingly concerned about efforts to combat climate change.
Cambridge residents, including students, have until October 18 to register to vote. Residents will head to the polls on November 7.

The last few months have been anything but quiet for Harvard. As many students, faculty, and staff left campus, Harvard’s president announced she was stepping down, a committee recommended that social groups be “phased out,” and the Department of Justice opened an investigation into Harvard’s admissions process— news that could shape life at Harvard for decades.
Here’s a rundown of the biggest headlines from the summer, in case you missed it.
The Presidential Search
By next summer, a new university president could be sitting in the corner office of Massachusetts Hall.
On June 14, University President Drew G. Faust announced she would step down from the presidency after a decade-long tenure, setting off what is likely to be a comprehensive search process. Past Harvard presidential searches have lasted months and spanned the country as the search committee narrows down a longlist of potential candidates from a litany of backgrounds to just one.
This time around, the search committee will include all 12 members of an expanded Harvard Corporation, as well as three members of the Board of Overseers. William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow, will lead the effort—and his public comments over the summer provided clues to what the body is looking for in a candidate. Some of the things he emphasized: centralizing Harvard’s administration, improving diversity, and leading the university forward in the age of President Donald Trump.
Lee sent an email in July soliciting input from Harvard affiliates through a designated email address. Students, meanwhile, called for an increased role in the search process; during the 2000 search, students voiced frustrations with being left out of it. Faculty and staff advisory committees have already been appointed, and the search committee is set to name a student advisory body soon.
Social Group Penalties Complicated
With a historic policy penalizing members of Harvard’s single-gender social groups set to take effect in the fall, the summer brought renewed faculty opposition and a committee report that threw the future of the policy into further flux.
The policy—which now applies to students in the Class of 2021—bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from student leadership positions, athletic captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships.
The policy has been engulfed in controversy since its announcement, with many students, alumni, and some faculty speaking out against it.  Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 has emerged as the most vocal opponent of the sanctions, even introducing a faculty motion in May 2016 intended to cancel the penalties.
Amid opposition, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in January announced a new committee charged with deciding whether the sanctions should be “revised or replaced.” In July, that faculty committee released a preliminary draft of its recommendations, proposing an all-out ban on Harvard’s social groups.
The preliminary report claimed a “strong majority” of the committee supported the decision to recommend banning social groups—but The Crimson reported in July 2017 that the social group ban received only seven votes from the 27-member committee, making it the third-most popular option considered.
A month later, Lewis filed a second motion against the College’s social group penalties. Twenty-one professors signed the document, which states that Harvard shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.”
Lewis’s motion is set for a vote at the October 3 Faculty meeting—the same meeting at which the faculty committee has said it will present its final recommendations regarding the social group policy.
Until then, members of the Class of 2021 remain subject to the penalties outlined in the original May 2016 policy.
Student Unionization Dispute
Harvard’s months-long student unionization process has been marked by prolonged and sometimes heated disagreements between the University and the unionization effort. This summer was no exception.
On July 7, the regional director of the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Harvard’s student unionization election, held in November 2016, had been unfair and should be invalidated. That election had counted more students voting against unionization than for it—but in his decision, John J. Walsh, Jr.
wrote that a list of eligible voters generated by Harvard before the election was inadequate and had “interfered with the employees’ exercise of a free and reasoned choice” in the vote.
Lawyers representing the University filed a brief with the national NLRB in August, urging the NLRB to let the results of the 2016 election stand and declaring past rulings requiring employers to comply with strict requirements for voter lists “outdated.”
The next step in the process is for the NLRB in Washington, D.C. to deliver a final ruling on the case.
The national NLRB is composed of presidential nominees, and at the end of former President Barack H. Obama’s time in office, the NLRB counted two Democrats, one Republican, and two empty spots. Since President Donald Trump took office—he has appointed two Republican nominees, Marvin Kaplan and William Emanuel— to fill those vacancies.
The Senate confirmed Kaplan earlier in August and has not yet voted on Emanuel’s confirmation. Some commentators have theorized that a NLRB with a Republican majority might be more likely to favor Harvard’s position in the case.
Department of Justice Investigating Admissions
The Justice Department turned up the heat in a longstanding debate over Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies in August, when it publicly vowed to investigate allegations that Harvard has unfairly denied admission to qualified Asian-American applicants. A department spokesperson said at the time that the investigation will focus on a single complaint filed in 2015 by 64 Asian-American groups that claims the College’s admissions process “unlawful[ly]” uses race to discriminate against Asian Americans.
Harvard’s affirmative action policies have long been a lightning rod for opponents of race-conscious admissions. In 2014, the anti-affirmative action group Project for Fair Representation—led by conservative provocateur Edward Blum—filed a lawsuit against the University alleging that Harvard unlawfully discriminates specifically against Asian-American applicants in its undergraduate admissions processes. That lawsuit is currently in the discovery process.
Several legal experts predict the Justice Department’s investigation means the department is planning to join the 2014 lawsuit. These analysts say the department has several options going forward—but it will most likely file to intervene against Harvard.
If the department does get involved, it will have a heavy impact on the lawsuit, according to Roger Clegg, the president of the conservative think tank Center for Equal Opportunity.
“It would bring the resources of the Justice Department into the lawsuit, and also the weight and the credibility of the Justice Department, too,” Clegg said. “Judges tend to pay attention to what the Justice Department says.”
Changes in the Square
The summer saw the departure of at least two Harvard Square gustatory mainstays, with more changes planned for the year to come. Out: Japanese noodles, pricey smoothies, and teriyaki burritos. In: raw fish, Australian burritos, and one controversial luxury mall.
Each citing competition for clientele in a crowded square, Boston-born burrito chain Boloco and London-based Japanese noodle chain Wagamama shuttered over the summer. After nearly two decades on Mount Auburn St., Boloco—which peddles “globally inspired burritos”—closed to make way for Zambrero, an Australian burrito chain gives to charity with every purchase.  Wagamama shut down in early July upon the end of its ten-year lease, and the property remains vacant.
Pokéworks, a Hawaiian-inspired seafood chain, will replace juice and smoothie vendor Liquiteria on Mass Ave. this fall. The restaurant specializes in “tuna, salmon, and other fish or tofu bases mixed with toppings and sauces in a rice bowl, salad bowl, or poké ‘burrito.’”
As Pokéworks breezed through the zoning process, Washington, D.C.-based chain &pizza continued its quest for a Square storefront, partnering with the dessert bakery Milk Bar to at last obtain initial approval from the Cambridge Planning Board. While the Board of Zoning Appeals had previously denied &pizza’s solo plans to move into the Brattle Street location—“a pizza is a pizza is a pizza,” one member said—the new partnership meets the requirements put forth after the initial rejection. The zoning board still must approve the changes to &pizza’s business plan.
Even further down the road, the Cambridge Historical Commission approved plans to create a pedestrian mall in the center of Harvard Square after months of meetings and community debate. The “Collection at Harvard Square” calls for renovations and additions to the series of storefront buildings on either side of the Curious George store, including the demolition of the Urban Outfitters building and replacement with a four-story building. The top of the buildings would then be connected with a rooftop pavilion. The proposed developments—still quite controversial among many residents—will be reviewed by the Planning Board before going forward further.

The name Harvard doesn’t exactly evoke thoughts of athletic prowess. But inside track and field circles, that fact may be starting to change.
Over the summer, the Crimson track and field team sent five athletes to the NCAA Outdoor Championships and qualified four for their respective junior national teams, representing the nations of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany.
In the U.S. junior national championship meet, sophomores Judy Pendergast and Eliza Rego competed in the 3,000-meter run and 3,000-meter steeplechase, respectively. While Rego placed eighth, Pendergast clocked a 9:49.97 to finish second and qualify for the U.S. team at the Pan America Junior Championships in Lima, Peru. Jacob McLennan was tabbed by Canada to compete in the same meet but in the 400-meter hurdles.
“Being able to represent my country is something I have dreamed about since I was a little kid,” McLennan said. “Moments like these are so special because it gives me the chance to look back at all the work I have put in thus far. This opportunity definitely increases the momentum going into next season.”
Across the pond, two more rising sophomores earned spots on their national teams. Lisa Tertsch of Darmstadt, Germany, earned a national spot with her 10:22.76 time in the 3,000-meter steeplechase earlier this year at the Stanford Cardinal Classic.
In the same race for the men, Will Battershill qualified for the United Kingdom team. At the European U20 Championships held in Grosseto, Italy, Battershill placed third overall in the qualifying round. Though he did not start the final round, his bronze-medal-qualifying time of 9:07.97 would have been the eighth-fastest. That performance was good enough for the sophomore to ensure the selection for his home country.
Earlier in the summer, several of the program’s athletes capped the outdoor season in Eugene, Ore., at the NCAA Outdoor Championships. Among the top programs in the nation, the Crimson emerged with several standout performances. Arriving with Ivy League championships in cross country as well as indoor and outdoor track, Harvard left with five All-American honors and 29th place as a team, the best finish among all colleges in the Northeast region.
Junior Gabby Thomas and graduated senior Jade Miller highlighted the weekend. Thomas brought home third in the 200-meter and 22nd in the 100-meter, while the veteran Miller grabbed sixth in the 400-meter hurdles. Men’s co-captain Efe Uwaifo claimed 15th in long jump, while classmate Nikki Okwelogu took 23rd in discus.
The second day of the four-day meet showcased the woman runners, and it was Thomas who took to the blocks first. Racing in the first heat of the day, the Florence, Mass., native clocked an 11.54 time. The finish, good enough seventh in the heat, placed her 22nd overall.
While the junior did not medal, she represented the first female Harvard sprinter even to compete in the event. For her effort, Thomas was given USTFCCCA All-America Honorable Mention honors.
Miller was up next. The senior was no stranger to the national stage—this competition marked her fourth time in as many years.
Miller raced in the third heat of the 400-meter hurdle semifinals to claim the second spot. Miller’s 56.98-second race was the sixth-fastest overall. She finished just behind USC’s Anna Cockrell, who clocked the second-fastest time of the day.
Thomas then took the track to compete in her most prolific event, the 200-meter hurdles. In the event for which she holds the school record—and for a time the fastest time of the season globally—Thomas placed first in the third heat and fifth on the day. With her 22.821 time, the sophomore came out just .001 seconds of the second-place finisher, Aaliyah Brown of Texas A&M.
“The finish of that race was important because it would determine my lane for the finals, and my intentions were to save some energy in prelims for the final,” Thomas said. “But towards the end, it was too close for comfort, so I had to grind for those last ten meters to get the first-place spot. It was close, so I wasn’t sure. I was excited to see that I was the heat winner.”
Uwaifo was the lone Crimson participant on the third day of competition. The triple jumper leapt 15.65 meters on his second jump to secure the 15th position, a career-high place at the national meet.
For his efforts, Uwaifo landed on the USTFCCCA All-American second team, becoming only the second male athlete in Harvard history to earn that distinction in the event.
The final day of competition began with another seasoned veteran for the Crimson. Okwelgou competed in the discus throw. The outgoing senior finished the event 23rd nationally with a 43.85-meter toss. She was awarded USTFCCCA All-America Honorable Mention for her effort, the final of a prolific career as a Harvard thrower.
Miller, another giant for the program, finished up in the 400-meter hurdle finals soon after. Competing in her second-ever finals, and first since 2015, Miller clocked a time of 56.61 seconds. The time secured sixth place and USTFCCAA First Team All-American honors.
Not 15 minutes after, Thomas was competing for her own national title. This race also marked Thomas’ second national finals in as many years. In the 2016 season, the then-freshman placed third.
This year, she achieved the same feat with a 22.61 race, just .01 seconds above her school record. Racking up USTFCCCA First Team All-America honors, the sophomore tied her effort last year for the best finish of any Crimson student-athlete in a sprint event. She continued an impressive career that looks to resume for Harvard during the upcoming season.
With Thomas and Miller combining to gain the team’s nine points for the meet, Harvard placed 29th as a team, the highest of any Northeast region school.
“It’s exciting and a great feeling to know that I am doing something that nobody has done before,” Thomas said. “But I also hope it puts Harvard on the map and lets everyone know that this program can be academically excellent as well as athletically. I want people to turn on the TV and see that it is possible for them—and even for my teammates to understand that this is the standard that the Harvard program is working towards.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a battle of two defending conference champions, the Harvard women’s soccer team renewed its crosstown rivalry with Northeastern on Tuesday night. At Parsons Field in Brookline, Mass., the teams met for the first time since clashing in the NCAA tournament almost 10 years ago, in 2008.
The stakes were much lower this time around, but for two teams that are still in the process of replacing key members from successful squads a year ago, the early season matchup served as an important benchmark.
“We were looking forward to this game to see how far we are in bringing along some of the younger players,” Crimson coach Chris Hamblin said. “It was clear we still have work to do, but Northeastern showed us where we can aim to be in just a couple more games.”
The Huskies (4-1-0), who were playing in their fifth game of the season, marched to a 2-0 victory on the strength of attacking fluidity that Harvard (1-1-0) could not match. Northeastern outshot its opponents 11-4 in the first half and did not let up after intermission, gliding to the win.
Hannah Rosenblatt, a junior forward, and Kerri Zerfoss, a sophomore midfielder, led the charge for the Huskies with a combined seven shots. Zerfoss scored first in the 39th minute, burying a left-footed strike in stride after a well-weighted pass from freshman forward Chelsea Domond.
Rosenblatt then added the insurance goal in the 76th minute. The build-up was almost a mirror image of that of the first tally, with Rosenblatt scoring off a through ball on the right side of the box.
“They made great plays to take control of the game,” said Crimson senior defender and captain Marie Becker. “We need to keep our shape better on defense, and that’s something we’ll work on before this weekend.”
Harvard managed to keep Northeastern star midfielder Hannah Lopiccolo contained to an extent, but the senior leader of the Huskies and CAA Preseason Play of the Year helped her team control possession and the flow of the game. Lopiccolo also tallied three shots, one of which was on frame.
Meanwhile, the young attacking core for the Crimson continues to find its footing. Freshmen forwards Lauren Raimondo and Murphy Agnew managed only three shots in total, and the team as a whole put the ball on frame twice the entire game.
Raimondo came closest in the 22nd minute when she received a pass on the right side of the box with only the goalkeeper to beat. From a tight angle, however, her shot was easily saved.
“We’ve liked what we’ve seen from our younger players in practice,” Becker said. “They’re getting in good positions on the field, and it’s only a matter of time before we see some results in the games.”
This season, Harvard faces the challenge of replacing graduated senior Midge Purce. For four years, Purce sparked the Crimson offense, tallying 42 goals in 63 career games.
That productivity led to four appearences on the All-Ivy first team and two seasons as Player of the Year. In June, Purce became the first player in Harvard history to earn a spot at the camp of the U.S. women’s national team.
Dealing with the absence of such a star player lingers as an important storyline. And on Tuesday, Northeastern shut down any Crimson scoring attempts.
For Huskies goalkeeper Nathalie Nidetch, two saves on the night were enough to earn her fourth clean sheet of the season. The preseason All-CAA Honorable Mention has been a rock in the back for Northeastern this year, allowing only two goals in 450 minutes of play.
On the other side, sophomores Kat Hess and junior Danielle Etzel once again split time in goal for Harvard. Both performed capably, with Etzel make four saves in the first 45 minutes and Hess making three after the half. Each allowed a goal, however, as the Huskies’ high-powered attack could not be contained.
“They gave us a good test on defense, and there’s a lot we’ll be looking at on the film,” Hamblin said. “It’s good for us to have a game like this at this point in the season.”
A strong non-conference schedule has been a staple for the Crimson in recent years. Even as Harvard has won multiple conference championships in the past decade ,the program has started a season 2-0-0 only once in the past 10 years.
After the loss to Northeastern, the Crimson will have to wait until next year to match that record.
