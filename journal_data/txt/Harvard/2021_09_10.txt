After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty years ago, on September 11, 2001, I walked into my office as the operations officer of a medical airlift squadron at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. A few seconds after I arrived, my secretary screamed out. She stood frozen, looking at the TV in horror, the blood draining from her face.
“A plane just flew into one of the World Trade Center towers.”
We speculated on what might cause such an accident. Then a second plane hit the towers.
By 3:30 a.m. the next morning, I was airborne, piloting one of six C-9A aeromedical evacuation aircraft (flying hospitals) from Scott Air Force Base to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. The Pentagon was burning, and the towers had collapsed. Our mission was simple — get the survivors to lifesaving treatment at specialty medical centers throughout the nation.
We sped toward the scene of the attacks as fast as our planes would allow on the darkest morning I have ever known. Our pilots, flight mechanics, and medical crews resolved to overcome whatever we faced and save lives.
The sun rose in front of us, but the darkness of knowing thousands of Americans had died senselessly just hours before sat heavy on our hearts. Even in the morning sun, the crew had little to say. We each knew the world would never be the same. Each contemplated the new reality in our own way.
Our air traffic control radios deepened the gloom. Normally full of constant chatter, ATC had nothing to say. Any other day, they would have changed our heading and altitude assignments many times to avoid other aircraft. But in the morning hours of Sept. 12, there were no other airplanes to avoid; the entire civilian fleet and most military aircraft had been grounded. Where thousands of airplanes would normally be in the air, we traveled alone.
There are but a handful of aviators who can say they were in the air on that silent morning. It was as if God had ordered the world to come to a halt. As we neared the nation’s capital, an F-15 came alongside to confirm our identity. There was no mistaking the giant red cross emblazoned on our tails. Descending toward Andrews, I looked out the left window of the flight deck to see a huge portion of the Pentagon crumbled and smoldering.
I worried the new day might have terrible things in store. I thought of my wife. She had called after the second airplane hit the towers. “What’s going on?” she asked through tears. “Are we safe? Is anyone safe?” Her words reflected how we all felt. Would the terrorists attack our subway, a jammed freeway, a sporting event, or a school full of children? We felt so vulnerable.
Years later, the crash site at the Pentagon is a beautiful park. I’ve gone there many times and thought about those who died on 9/11. I’ve thought of the men and women who returned to the Pentagon the morning of Sept. 12 to show our enemies they could not dampen our resolve or damage our democracy. I’ve thought of how we drove the Taliban from power and established democracy in Afghanistan.
Tomorrow, I will consider how our democracy survived the 9/11 assault by radical terrorists, just like it survived assaults from Nazi fascism, Soviet communism, and even the sectionalism and racism of our own civil war. It survived because we nurtured it, refined it, and made it better with each generation.
After 9/11, we rallied around our democracy, but now a corrosive drift toward polarized politics has emerged. We must learn from 9/11 as we consider the fragility of our future. Previous generations have survived assaults on U.S. democracy because a government of the people supported it, strong institutions sustained it, and a powerful military protected it. But U.S. democracy isn’t immune. As we have seen, without a rock-solid foundation, democracy fails quickly.
If history is any indicator (and it is), our next threat is just around the corner. Will it be from China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran? Or will it be internal, rising from political ideologies that are moving dangerously toward irreparable division? We must strive to repair those divisions. They erode support, sustainment, and the ability to protect our democracy. They make us more susceptible to external threats. So, rather than divide the nation, let’s repair it.
There are plenty of examples. Let’s follow the lead of Lyndon B. Johnson, who stood up for civil rights; of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s non-partisan investment in national infrastructure; of Theodore Roosevelt’s stand against monopolies and for the environment; and of John F. Kennedy’s focus on civic responsibility and his words “… ask what you can do for your country.” As we face tragedy, divisions, and catastrophe, will we rally? It’s no exaggeration to say that our democracy depends on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up in Texas, I only wanted to leave. This desire is a rite of passage for all high school students from the South who end up in the Northeast. We all want to flee the close-minded and traditionalist coffin of the former confederacy and find refuge among the revered Northern progressives. And I think it's a good tradition to have, for in the South, going against the political and social grain triggers an energetic bout of critical thinking.
But then I actually left.
I made the long trek from Houston to Boston, toting my naïve optimism that the North had figured it out and was the place people told me it would be. But Houston and Boston are more alike than people realize — broken cities full of broken people who often let their brokenness get the best of them. Yes, the states of Texas and Massachusetts may be different colors on the electoral college map, but the people of the North are not better than the people of the South. They are more of the same.
I learned about this enigma slowly over the course of my first semester in Cambridge. And as I did, I deconstructed the binary I’d internalized of the South always being “bad” and the North always being “good” — the binary the New England’s social media progressives pavloved me into believing. The South has problems (major understatement, I know). But what I did not realize before moving to Boston was that the North has the same exact ones. The justice system is inefficient and unjust, people can be closed-minded and unkind, and policies are discriminatory and unhelpful. The capitalist interests of companies run a city, not the people, and there are good people working through the mess to make something beautiful and more equitable out of it.
I call this the “Houston to Harvard” mindset — a mode of thinking that discards the fabricated binaries of life for a spectrum of complicated truths after a long period of disillusionment.
Can you judge someone for not knowing what light is when they were raised in a cave their whole life? Many of us would answer no. But simultaneously, many of us would answer that an individual is entirely responsible for any and all of their political and social beliefs, regardless of the environment or family in which they grew up.
This is what a black and white binary enforces: thinking that there is no excuse for thinking a certain way or having certain beliefs, and that passing harsh, unyielding judgment is an acceptable — and in many circles, the only acceptable — response. And while I do not agree with many intolerant beliefs more prevalent in the South, I can also understand why a lot of people in my hometown think the way they do. I understand (again, I do not agree) because the binary of everything in the South being bad and the North being a golden sanctuary for social justice was extinguished within me, making room for cognitive dissonance and an intricate spectrum of gray.
I do not mean to excuse the trauma and violence people inflict (discriminatory slurs, cultural appropriation, racial profiling) with the simple justification that they were “raised that way.” I’ve also known many people who have been able to deconstruct the beliefs and mentalities by which they were raised — friends and family that have fought against the societal and political grain for the sake of their identity or what they believe to be right.
But I also say that judgment is the easiest emotion to access because it exists in opposition to critical thinking. In seeing something you do not agree with, it is instinctive to react in a manner fueled by that initial emotion. But such a response reinforces binary thinking.
It is so easy to throw yourself behind the gut response of condemnation when Texas essentially outlawed abortion last week. It is so easy to throw yourself behind the gut response of unbridled anger when vaccination rates in Southern states fail to rise. It is so easy to throw yourself behind a self-indulgent feeling of pride at your own states’ progressive behavior and a consequent denunciation of anyone you feel like does not fit that mold. But in doing so, you avoid the nuances of individual human experiences and thereby erase the texture of the issue itself. Categorizing entire groups of people through snap judgements contributes to the formation of echo chambers, confirmation biases, and all manners of twisted truths.
What the “Houston to Harvard” mindset taught me is that dismissing the South as intrinsically “bad” is unhelpful. It’s a disposition founded upon convenience and situational truths. I am sick of the North using the South as its scapegoat in order to preserve its progressive image. There is so much more to this conversation than the convenient binary of the South being “bad” and the North being “good.”
People are complex, and fitting masses of unique individuals into superficial categories is dehumanizing. The people of the North are not better than the people in the South. It is much more complicated than that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of last week’s uptick in Covid cases, Harvard abruptly postponed Crimson Jam: a large, outdoor concert that, right up to its cancellation, we really believed would be a safe-enough moment of unmasked revelry.
The deja vu of it all made the cancellation, reasonable as it was, sting. Many of us remember the throng of last-minute event cancelations that preceded our campus evacuation in March 2020. Crimson Jam’s postponement and the administrative communication that followed brought a previously far-fetched thought to the forefront of many of our minds: If Covid cases continue to rise through the winter months — if the end of the tunnel keeps extending — could we be forced to evacuate campus again?
In the words of B.o.B, we could really use a wish right now.
Harvard, please don’t send us home. Not again. And especially not without letting us know what it would take to get there.
A recent flurry of emails from Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair makes it clear that restrictions on campus will fluctuate with caseloads. The University is trying to adapt to “changing conditions” as positive tests mount. Administrators emphasized that the success of “our campus strategy” hinges on community compliance with rules put in place to reduce transmission. Partying was singled out as an affront to this strategy; testing cadences were increased in response. Most pacifying to us, the University took time to reaffirm its commitment to doing everything possible to maintain the in-person academic experience in these emails.
We feel the exact same way — and we’re terrified of the alternative.
Our trepidation makes sense. Our previous move-out experience was brutal, abrupt, and disruptive. The thought of having to flee, pick our lives back up again, and lose another year of college to Covid is beyond scary. The administration should anticipate this unease, and ought to help us navigate it. We need clear guidance on what exactly it would take for us to be sent back home.
This metric for a move back home could take the form of a variety of numbers: Daily positivity rates, number of severe cases, even student compliance statistics. It needs, above all, to be a specific, easily trackable threshold that we know we must cross before being thrust back to our childhood bedrooms. The measure would, ideally, also offer intermediate cautionary measures that correspond with these specific quantitative numbers.
In determining appropriate reactive guidelines, we urge the administration to consider its actions broadly: Where does Harvard stand in the context of other colleges’ Covid responses? And, more importantly, how does our response square with the public health situation and guidance of Cambridge and Boston?
Current University-published Covid numbers are not nearly enough. As of yesterday evening, the University reported 76 new cases over the past seven days. But what do those numbers really mean? We simply don’t know. This number of cases back in the spring amongst an unvaccinated campus would have been a nightmare — but now with the help of Moderna, Pfizer, and J&J, the game has changed. In order to make sense of this number, we need greater specificity regarding infections, including rates of severe illness and breakthrough infections.
A clear, metrics-based framework for where we might be headed would allow the student body to keep an eye on current numbers with a sense of how close we are to a move-out or to more severe restrictions. That knowledge alone would prove extremely reassuring and likely encourage students to adopt safer behaviors, knowing what may come if they don’t. The colored reopening system Harvard rolled out during the 2020-2021 school year functioned similarly. Good behavior led to a move to a less restrictive campus. In this new phase of the pandemic, we need a similar carrot to nudge us toward good behavior.
If we are treated like adults who can peek into the decision-making process, we must act accordingly. We need to abide by campus Covid regulations as strictly as possible. Parties, for example, have already been identified as a key source of transmission; for the community’s sake, we need to think twice about attending them.
None of us want to be sent home. The College needs to reaffirm that campus-wide eviction remains the absolute last resort, and offer a clear boundary that we can’t afford to cross.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 9, 11:03 p.m.
Following years of public pressure, Harvard said Thursday it would allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire, paving the way for it to eventually divest from the sector. The move marks a stark twist in a decade-long saga that has pitted student activists against University administrators and dominated campus politics for years.
In an email to Harvard affiliates Thursday afternoon, University President Lawrence S. Bacow — who has for years publicly opposed divestment — stopped short of using the word divest, but said that “legacy investments” through third-party firms “are in runoff mode,” and called financial exposure to the fossil fuel industry imprudent.
Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, which has been pushing the University to pull its investments in the fossil fuel industry since it was founded in 2012, declared victory.
“So long as Harvard follows through, this is divestment,” Connor Chung ’23, a Divest Harvard organizer, said. “This is what they told us for a decade they couldn’t do, and today, the students, faculty, and alumni have been vindicated.”
Bacow wrote that the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s $41.9 billion endowment, “does not intend” to make future investments in the fossil fuel industry. He said the University would not renew HMC’s partnerships with private equity funds that have holdings in the sector once its current obligations to them expire.
“Given the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long-term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission, we do not believe such investments are prudent,” Bacow wrote.
Fossil fuels make up less than 2 percent of the University’s endowment — but they won’t disappear overnight.
Per a footnote in Bacow’s letter, Harvard holds a legal obligation to fund “up to the maximum capital committed at the time of the investment,” meaning that its endowment funds will likely go toward completing its obligations to private equity firms that invest in fossil fuels for years to come.
Bacow did not provide a timeline for the liquidation.
The divestment debate has consumed campus in recent years, with supporters of the movement filing legal complaints, storming the field at the Harvard-Yale football game in 2019, staging protests across campus, and gaining seats on school governance boards.
Harvard administrators have long contended the school is best positioned to address climate change through its teaching, research, and campus sustainability efforts. Before Thursday, HMC had not explicitly committed to pulling its endowment funds from firms that invest in the fossil fuel sector.
HMC said in February that it no longer directly invests in the fossil fuel industry, and that its indirect investments in the sector make up less than 2 percent of the endowment. By the end of fiscal year 2020, the endowment’s direct and indirect exposure to the fossil fuel industry had decreased by more than 80 percent since fiscal year 2008.
HMC also previously pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in its endowment by 2050.
In its February 2021 Climate Report, HMC wrote that it plans to spend the next few years working to gain access to the carbon emissions data from all of its public and private market managers — who have not historically provided this level of information on their portfolios.
In his Thursday letter, Bacow also pointed to the University’s efforts to promote research on climate change, including its appointment this week of economics professor James H. Stock as the first-ever Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability.
On campus, the University has committed since 2018 to reaching fossil fuel neutrality in its operations by 2026 and eliminating its use of fossil fuels for heating, cooling, and power by 2050. Harvard’s success in decreasing emissions on campus has slowed in recent years, however. Campus greenhouse gas emissions stayed flat between 2016 and 2019 despite reductions over the previous decade, according to data from the Office for Sustainability. The University also fell short of its 2020 waste and water reduction goals.
William E. “Bill” McKibben ’82, founder of climate campaign group 350.org and a former Crimson president, wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard’s “obstinance” in refusing to divest for years cost the University prestige and money.
“Honestly, I thought Harvard would never divest,” he wrote. “That it finally did is an enormous tribute to generations of Harvard students who have never let up, and to faculty and alumni who backed them up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the first day of September, Harvard withdrew proposed schedules it sent to the dining services union UNITE HERE Local 26 the previous month after the union alleged the University's proposal would slash jobs.
In August, the union alleged the proposed schedules would eliminate 20 percent of current full-time jobs at the residential houses and 8 percent of total hours when they went into effect during the next academic year. Local 26 flyered campus during undergraduate move-in, calling on students to support the union in its campaign for increased job security.
Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an email that the University told the union in a Sept. 1 meeting that it would withdraw its proposal.
“Draft schedules previously provided at the request of the union will be voided to further emphasize the commitment to HUDS’ current team,” she wrote.
The preliminary schedules were originally designed to accommodate changes HUDS is making to undergraduate dining options, including an expanded weekend brunch, meal time changes, and the shifting needs of students.
The drafted schedules were separate from the dining workers’ ongoing contract negotiations with the University, which began in mid-May.
Now, with the schedules voided, HUDS will either maintain hours for current dining services employees or work with the union to create new schedules, according to the statement.
“In an effort to clarify and reiterate HUDS’ support for its Local 26 team members, HUDS has put forth a commitment to maintain the authorized hours of every current HUDS employee until such time as they elect a new position or role within the department OR HUDS and the union can work collaboratively to develop new schedules that maintain our commitment to sustainable jobs and meeting student needs,” Martin wrote.
HUDS will still reserve the right to reevaluate whether vacant positions are necessary for operations as students’ needs change over time, Martin added.
Local 26 President Carlos Aramayo wrote in an emailed statement that the union will continue to campaign for “meaningful job security.”
“We are continuing to meet with Harvard in the hope of negotiating a contract that moves dining hall workers forward, not backward,” he wrote. “We have not yet achieved meaningful job security that would guarantee that cafeteria workers will not lose income after returning to work following the covid-19 related shut downs.”
Job security has long been a central issue for Harvard’s dining workers. During the last round of contract negotiations, dining workers went on strike for 22 days, in part over “sustainable jobs” and summer employment. This past summer, the union also rallied in front of the Law School to protest layoffs of former contracted workers as dining services positions at the Law School were incorporated directly into HUDS.
“We will continue to campaign until that modest goal is achieved,” Aramayo added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students from Bangladesh and West Bengal joined together during the Covid-19 pandemic and founded the Bengali Association of Students at Harvard — a new space for Bengali students to connect with their cultural roots.
BASHA began as a GroupMe chat started in the spring of 2019 by board member Mutahara “Nuri” Bhuiyan ’22 after she noticed Bengali students did not have their own space on campus.
“I noticed that there really wasn't a space for people who had backgrounds in Bangladesh,” Bhuiyan said.
In the spring of 2020, Tauheed Z. Islam ’21 and Saimun Habib ’21 drafted a constitution to make BASHA an official student group, although the club largely remained dormant. Club involvement began ramping up in July 2020 and soon after, BASHA held its first meeting and outreach events in August.
Some pandemic-induced crises affecting Bangladeshi people — including workers being laid off and starvation — catalyzed the club into action, according to Bhuiyan.
“It was a really bad situation that made people want to connect with their ethnicity,” Bhuiyan said. “To just have a bunch of us who felt passionate about getting this club going, out of this desire to help the Bengal and coordinate some humanitarian efforts.”
Board member Tahmid Ahmed ’22 wrote in an email that he has enjoyed getting to meet people from similar backgrounds while learning more about his culture.
“The Bengali community was a lot bigger than I thought it was based on the sheer size of the group chat, so it was really nice to see that many of my peers came from a similar ethnic background,” Ahmed wrote. “I not only get to be in touch with the Bengali community, but I also get to celebrate my culture in a fun way.”
The club also provides a space for international Bengali students. Board member Muhtasim “Sadab” Mannan ’24 said he was appreciative of finding BASHA on campus after learning there were only around twelve international Bangladeshi undergraduates.
“It’s such a small number, relatively speaking, given that we are around half or more than half the population of the U.S. and only two people in my year managed to come to Harvard,” Mannan said.
Sadaf T. Khan ’23, a member of BASHA, said he hopes the group continues to bring Bangladeshi students together while creating connections with other student organizations.
“My hope for the future is that we ultimately bring more attention to the Bangladeshi people on campus,” Khan said. “I also hope to make sure that this group pushes for progressive ideals and also attempts to create strong bridges again with other cultural groups.”
Members of the club said they appreciate the sense of belonging BASHA offers.
“Every event would be just full of references and full of memories that we all relate to. And stories that we all just understood without, at least in my experience, without really having to try to fit in,” Bhuiyan said. “That feeling of belonging came naturally for a lot of people.”
Khan also said the club had positively impacted his Harvard experience.
“The acronym ‘BASHA’ is actually the Bangla word for home, and honestly, I want to say that the club has made Harvard feel more like home,” Khan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard's campus has come to life again this fall as students and faculty return to in-person classes, one defining presence in Harvard Yard remains elusive: tourists and prospective students.
As Harvard's gates remain closed to non-affiliates and the coronavirus spreads, Harvard tour groups continue to lead modified tours, virtually or on restricted paths around campus.
The College first restricted in-person tours – which typically ran free of charge and were open to all visitors – at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, when students left campus to learn remotely.
The Harvard Visitor Center will continue to suspend official in-person tours due to ongoing concerns about Covid-19. Though it declined to comment on when it plans to resume in-person tours, the center said it will start up virtual tours later this month.
Other tour groups have had to shift their policies to adhere to the College’s new protocols.
The Crimson Key Society – a student organization whose members lead Harvard’s official historical tours – ran three tours daily on weekdays and Saturdays prior to the pandemic, according to its president, Charles D. “Davis” Bailey ’22.
Since then, Crimson Key Society has led in-person tours for students at the First-Year Orientation and for visiting scholars through the Harvard Marshal’s Office, but tours for the general public remain banned.
Though organized group tours in Harvard Yard are prohibited due to coronavirus precautions, Trademark Tours – an agency known for its “Hahvahd” tour that will merge with Harvard Student Agencies – runs in-person walking tours around Harvard Square.
Trademark Tours CEO Daniel A. Bodt ’07 wrote in an email that Trademark Tours has taken precautions against Covid -19 during their in-person tours.
“We have added audio headsets that connect wirelessly to a tour guide microphone. This allows guests to practice social distancing and keeps the guide's voice from straining when wearing a mask,” he wrote. “We've also capped group size and encourage wearing of masks based on city and state regulations.”
While Bodt said Trademark Tours has not yet received word from Harvard about when the Yard will reopen to tour groups.
Crimson Key Society tour coordinator Kathryn L. Hodakowski ’22-’23 said the organization is currently collaborating with the Visitor Center to resume tours once restrictions are lifted.
“As ambassadors of Harvard College, crucial to our identities and organization is we want to spread our love and joy being students at Harvard with others,” said Hodakowski, who led tours prior to the pandemic. “I think that it does help significantly to interact with the students and share their personal experiences.”
Bailey said he believes in-person tours are important for portraying Harvard to prospective students as well as “the outside world.”
“There's a long history of this place being a bastion of academic elitism – and, as such, a lot of people hear about Harvard, and they have this image that at this point is not very accurate,” Bailey said. “So we really try to dispel some of these preconceived notions that people might have.”
Bailey said he believes Harvard should be a "welcoming and open and accessible place for people who aren't yet or aren't ever affiliated with the school."
“The in-person tours are a vital piece of that puzzle, and I hope they can return soon," he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first live event at the JFK Jr. Forum since the pandemic shuttered campus in March 2020, the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics hosted a panel of its resident fellows on Thursday.
The six resident fellows — including former U.S. Representative William M. “Mac” Thornberry (R-Texas) and former Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sarah I. Gideon — discussed issues such as partisanship in politics and civic engagement.
Ashley Allison — a political commentator for CNN and the former national coalitions director for Biden-Harris — argued for the importance of coalition-building in the current political landscape.
“Politics is just people. Elected officials are people, the voters are people,” Allison said. “Our human nature is that we would rather do things together than separately, and a coalition is an opportunity to do something together.”
Thornberry addressed the power of ordinary people, praising those willing “to roll up [their] sleeves and do something to make it better.”
“We’re in a challenging time,” he said. “One thing that was always so reassuring to me, however, was the realization that the strength of the country is not in Washington D.C. and what we do or do not do in Congress, it's out in the communities.”
In response to a student question about how the fellows would reimagine the status quo, Trymaine Lee — a correspondant for MSNBC and the host of the podcast Into America — said the U.S. needs to “engage with our white supremacist founding.”
“I think two things can be true at once,” Lee said. “We can have in our very fiber the kind of racism that destroys lives and shapes generations, and also be a great nation that aspires for more.”
Allison said she believes the answers to the challenges facing the nation — including the pandemic — will come from its youth.
“I think the answer is sitting here,” she said. “I think it's sitting on other college campuses. I think it's in elementary schools.”
The panel, moderated by IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, also featured Holly Kuzmich, the executive director of the George W. Bush Institute, and Arnon Mishkin, the director of the Fox News Decision Desk.
JFK Forum Student Chair Anan M. Hafez ’22 said the panel’s focus on democracy is crucial in the context of the pandemic and the current political landscape.
“The past year and a half of Covid has exposed and brought to light all the cracks in our democracy that we didn't really see before,” he said. “I think our fellows this semester are really prepared to address all those cracks that they see.”
Regarding the return to in-person events, audience member Lap T. Ngyuen ’24 said he “could not be happier.”
“This is just a fantastic event where you get to actually meet and interact in person,” he said. “We lose that human connection over Zoom, whereas here you meet the individuals and you can trade a little quip here and there.”
“The experience feels much more authentic,” Nguyen added.

It was the beginning of the 2001 fall semester, and Judith S. “Judy” Palfrey ’67 was a faculty dean in Adams House. When she learned on the morning of Sept. 11 that two planes had crashed into the Twin Towers in downtown Manhattan, Palfrey recalls rushing to the Adams House dining hall.
“I canceled everything that was planned for the day and just stayed literally in the dining hall because the students were pouring in, sitting at various tables, crying,” she said in an interview earlier this week.
Saturday marks 20 years since the worst attack on American soil. In interviews this week, Harvard affiliates recalled how Harvard's campus processed that grim day in American history, when hijackers attempted to crash four civilian planes into major sites throughout the United States, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths.
Erica J. Doran ’05, a former Crimson president, recalls the chaos among classmates as they learned about the attacks while gathered in common rooms and spaces to watch the television report with classmates.
“After the first tower hit, there was just a lot of chaos and confusion as to what the cause was and what really was going on,” Doran said. “After the second tower came down, it became a lot more apparent that it was terrorism.”
“Just standing with strangers and gasping and staring at a small television in the gym, which was so bizarre,” she added.
Claire P. Goldsmith ’05, a former Crimson editor, said that members of the then-freshman class watched the Sept. 11 attacks in utter fear.
“There was just a lot of noise in that room and fear,” she said. “We all just felt so alone and confused.”
Members of the Class of 2005 remember having difficulty getting in touch with their friends and families due to network failures. Doran said she specifically remembered people in her entryway unable to reach out to loved ones.
“I think for those with immediate family, it was even more terrifying that morning to feel so far away and removed, and just sort of watch what was transpiring,” she said.
In the days following 9/11, the University stayed open. Students grappled with the attacks, planning blood drives to help victims and demonstrating outside of Widener Library, advocating for a peaceful response to the attacks.
Many students personally affected longed to return home in the following days.
Some students contemplated returning home out of fear that Harvard would be targeted next, according to Goldsmith. She also said that campus quickly became consumed in conversations about international politics and how the U.S. would react.
“The campus became pretty politicized in certain ways,” Goldsmith said. “There was pretty quickly just a lot of conversation around how Bush had responded.”
Palfrey recalls that then-University President Lawrence H. Summers summoned students to Tercentenary Theater in Harvard Yard to hold a moment of silence. Judy recalled that Summers, who lost close friends in the attacks, was emotional while addressing students.
“We had been summoned to Tercentenary Theater once before, when John Kennedy died, and it was for me — for us — kind of a reprise of that very sad moment,” she said.
Among the worries of the day, Palfrey and her husband, John G. “Sean” Palfrey '67, who was also a faculty dean, said they were concerned for their Muslim students, who feared anti-Muslim bias would rise in the wake of the attacks. Before the attacks, the Palfreys had scheduled an event for Muslim college students around Boston, but even in the aftermath of the day, students urged them not to cancel it, she said.
“Going into that upper common room that afternoon and just hugging those students was really, really important,” Judy Palfrey said.
In 2001, Diana L. Eck was faculty dean of Lowell House. She said she was in the library when she heard about the attacks in New York, and immediately went to the junior common room of Lowell House to check on the students congregating.
Eck, a professor of comparative religion and Indian studies at Harvard Divinity School, remembers mosques in Cambridge opening their doors to everyone that weekend.
“There was a sense that we needed all of us and local communities needed to know who our Muslim neighbors were,” she said.
Harvard affiliates were also among the thousands of Americans who died in the attacks.
Edward R. “Ted” Hennessy Jr. ’88 boarded American Airlines flight 11 in the early morning of Sept. 11, heading to Los Angeles for a business trip. Shortly after, the plane was commandeered by five hijackers and flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
Ronald E. Corcillo ’89 was Hennessy’s college roommate in Leverett House. He said the news on 9/11 had seemed surreal, but reality set in the next morning when he received a call from a mutual college friend. He said he immediately knew it was news of Hennessy’s death.
“At that point, it changed completely from being something that was so surreal to something that was so real,” Corcillo said. “Once you knew someone who was actually involved, it became completely different.”
A few days later, Corcillo flew the reverse path Hennessy was supposed to have flown on Sept. 11, heading to Belmont, Mass. for Hennessy’s funeral.
“The funeral was an incredible event,” he said. “It was in Belmont, not far from Harvard, which is a small town. And yet the streets were packed with traffic for miles in every direction. I'm not sure Belmont ever saw a bigger event.”
Judy Palfrey said the events of 9/11 changed generations graduating from Harvard for years to come.
“The day before 9/11, if you were a Harvard student, there was nothing in the world you couldn't do,” she said. “There was a bravado. There was a sense of we can absolutely do anything. After 9/11, that bravado was gone."

When Harvard brought a limited number of undergraduate students back to campus in fall 2020, it promised a robust, in-house contact tracing system would limit exposures to the coronavirus and that comfortable accommodations would be provided for those who needed to isolate after testing positive.
The return of the full student body this fall, however, has put that contact tracing and isolation system under considerable stress — especially with the surge in Covid-19 cases following move-in.
Students who have been contact traced told The Crimson they were concerned with the delay in receiving a notification and a dearth of information in the message from ​​Harvard University Health Services. Several others who have entered isolation reported an array of issues with their accommodations, including a lack of drinking water, trouble ordering food, and leaking pipes.
The University is using the Harvard Square Hotel and Cronkhite Graduate Center to temporarily house undergraduate students who test positive and require isolation. As of Thursday, 137 Harvard affiliates — including faculty, staff, and students living off-campus — are in isolation, though some may be isolating at home, while 33 are in quarantine.
While students from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Law School may also isolate themselves at the hotel, Cronkhite has been reserved for undergraduate use only, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
As of Tuesday, 79 students were in the two locations in isolation or quarantine, Dane wrote in an emailed statement. All but one was an undergraduate student.
Harvard Square Hotel was used for isolation housing during the previous academic year. Despite the opening of Cronkhite, Dane noted that neither facility has reached full capacity.
“We can never draw either building down to zero availability, because space must be reserved for maintenance issues,” she wrote. “Cronkhite was opened because additional space was needed.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on students’ specific experiences in isolation housing, citing privacy concerns.
Soon after Daniel Salgado-Alvarez ’24 tested positive on Sept. 1, he received an email with instructions to sign up for meals, a packing list, contact information, and walking directions to his isolation housing: the Harvard Square Hotel.
As it was raining, a tutor in the Dudley Community helped Salgado-Alvarez arrange for an empty Harvard Shuttle to drive him to the hotel.
After checking in, however, he said he discovered that he could only order meals between midnight and 10 a.m. For students in both the hotel and Cronkhite, lunch, dinner, and the following day’s breakfast are delivered together once a day.
“You kind of have to stay up for meals,” Salgado-Alvarez said. “I feel like if I order at eight or nine when I wake up, my food gets here very late.”
In addition, Salgado-Alvarez said that in the first week, the drop-down menu allowed him to request no more than two water bottles a day.
“The past few boxes have come with an orange juice in them, but not a water bottle,” Salgado-Alvarez said. “One of the papers said we could order stuff delivered to us through Securitas, like if we needed cleaning supplies or water. I’ve been requesting trash bags for the past three days, and they have not given me that, so I don’t know if people would have luck with water.”
A student in isolation in Cronkhite — whom The Crimson granted anonymity to discuss personal medical information — also said they could not request more than two water bottles a day, despite having told a nurse that they require extra water due to low blood pressure.
Three gallons of water were delivered to their room the next day, four days into their isolation period. But before they could drink it, the student said they fainted in their room and had to be rushed by ambulance to Mount Auburn Hospital for dehydration.
Students also reported issues with hot water at both isolation locations. Salgado-Alvarez said there was no hot water in his shower on some days at the hotel, while the student in Cronkhite said the showers there — which are located in a shared hallway bathroom — had no hot water and leaks.
Dane wrote that “no concerns regarding plumbing in Cronkhite have been reported to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to date,” but “Facilities is looking into these reports to ensure everything is in working order.”
Aayush Karan ’23 was the only student in his suite of four to dodge contracting Covid-19, but as a result of the exposures, he received several contact-tracing emails.
In the standard contact tracing email, unvaccinated students are told to contact HUHS and isolate immediately. Meanwhile, asymptomatic vaccinated students are asked to “monitor for any potential Covid symptoms for 14 days post-exposure.”
Any vaccinated contacts who do develop symptoms are told to notify the HUHS contact tracing team, “stay away from others, get a PCR test ASAP, and isolate until your test result is back.”
“The instructions aren’t too drastic if you’re asymptomatic — it’s just you test every other day,” Karan said. “You just monitor yourself, so that’s what I’ve been doing.”
When Alex E. Iansiti ’21-’22 received a contact tracing notification on Sunday, he and his suitemates quickly tried to determine how worried they should be.
“It was like a game of Clue,” he said. “Everybody’s trying to assess the damage, kind of figure out the culprit, obviously [being exposed] from a roommate would be much worse than someone on our floor, versus someone in a class with a bunch of people.”
After talking with his suitemates and classmates, he began to suspect that all of the roughly 90 students in Humanities 20: “A Colloquium in the Visual Arts” had been contacted after their first lecture on Sept. 1. Out of Iansiti’s suitemates and classmates, only those who were taking Humanities 20 were also sent the notification.
While Iansiti did not want to find the exact individual who tested positive, he said he would have appreciated more information from the email on where the risk came from and what level of risk he faced.
“I wish there was some more indication of, ‘Oh, it’s because you’re in Hum 20,’ rather than me having to figure it out by myself,” Iansiti said.
Newton, the University spokesperson, wrote in an email that HUHS does not include further details in its alerts to “maintain the privacy of the person who tested positive.”
Another student whom The Crimson granted anonymity raised concerns about the length of time it took for HUHS to contact him after an exposure.
He said he immediately went into isolation after his friend informed him that they had tested positive, but it took HUHS another 30 hours to contact him.
According to Newton, HUHS’s contact tracing team prioritizes calls to people who are confirmed to have tested positive because of the risk of spread. Those who know they have been exposed should avoid socializing and fill out the University’s symptom screening tool, Crimson Clear.
The student — who said he is fully vaccinated — said he was concerned about the number of people in his position who had been exposed, but not aware of their exposure until after they had already socialized during Labor Day weekend, which he called a “recipe for disaster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign organized a rally Thursday afternoon calling on Harvard to divest from industries, companies, and funds they say are part of the prison-industrial complex.
The HPDC released a report in 2019 alleging that the University has at least $3 million in investments in prison-related companies. Harvard has previously stated that the University has no direct holdings in businesses that operate private prisons.
University spokesperson Jonathan Swain declined to comment on Thursday’s rally and HPDC’s demands.
HPDC provides a capacious definition of “prison-industrial complex,” including state and non-state entities, weapons manufacturers, bail bondsmen, analytics and surveillance technology manufacturers, police and guard unions, and pharmaceutical corporations.
Thursday’s protest was organized to mark the 50th anniversary of the Attica Prison Rebellion, in which prisoners at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility in New York seized control of the prison to demand improved living conditions, sparking the bloodiest prison confrontation in U.S. history.
Protest organizer Lydia S. Ghuman, a student at Harvard Law School, opened the rally by recounting the demands of the Attica prisoners. Those demands are similar to those of present-day incarcerated advocates for prisoners’ rights, Ghuman said.
“These demands still exist today and are arguably more dire,” she said.
During the rally, Divinity School student Azani A. Creeks read from a letter written by another Divinity School student to her mother, who is incarcerated. In the letter, the student tells her mother about Harvard’s investments.
“‘Now that I attend Harvard University my story is complicit with a system that would choose to dehumanize you,’” Creeks read from the letter. “I pray that Harvard University will, someday, see you as I see you. I pray that Harvard would own the harm they have caused you, and divest from companies that invest in your previous ‘enslavement.’”
Joseph M. “Joe” Pinto, a Divinity School alumnus and an early organizer with HPDC, said he attended the protest to remind Harvard that the group will continue to put pressure on the University this year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic preventing them from demonstrating on campus over the past year.
“Campus has reopened and we’re here,” he said. “We haven’t gone anywhere.”
Pinto also said that while Harvard may not directly invest in private prisons, the University bears responsibility for what HPDC claims are indirect investments in the prison industry.
“You actually can pull out your indirect funds,” Pinto said. “There are filters that can be applied pretty easily to investing that say, ‘we want our money here, but not there.’”
Ghuman said after the rally that she appreciated the increased recognition of the issues for which HPDC advocates, compared to when the campaign initially formed in 2018.
“When HPDC first started, we would have to fight for something as simple as to get the word ‘abolition’ even recognized,” Ghuman said. “Now, we already have a similar framework and starting ground with people.”
Ghuman said she was optimistic about the future of the divest movement.
“If we can make Harvard divest, a lot of other schools will divest,” Ghuman said. “It’s a slow and long battle, but it’s one we think we can win – it’ll just take time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part IV of our Freshman Survey series. Part I is here, Part II is here, and Part III is here. Full data and visualizations will be released later this week.
As freshmen scurried across the Yard last week, many were headed to their first in-person class for the first time in 18 months. This classroom experience was far from the normal, though, with many pandemic norms — including compulsory masking — still in place.
Most members of the Class of 2025 reported spending the entirety of their senior year learning in-person with masks or completely online. Twenty-one percent of respondents indicated that they ended their high school tenure remotely.
Students hailing from the Midwest reported finishing high school with fully in-person learning at the highest rates — 39 percent — followed by 35 percent of students from the Southeast. Only 20 percent of students from the West Coast finished their school year without some remote component.
Many freshmen also reported the 18-month period of unconventional learning negatively impacted their mental health. Roughly 63 percent of respondents said the pandemic contributed to a decline in their mental health, with 91 and 67 percent of this subset citing social isolation and stress, respectively, as additional causes. Additionally, 16 percent of respondents pointed to income insecurity resulting from the pandemic as a factor that worsened their mental health.
The pandemic’s negative impact on mental health varied across gender. While 67 percent of female respondents said their mental health suffered during the pandemic, only 55 percent of males reported the same. Furthermore, of those who listed social isolation as a contributing factor to mental health deterioration, 56 percent of respondents were female, while only 40 percent were male.
Despite the widespread impact of the pandemic, only 14 percent of surveyed students reported contracting coronavirus over the course of the pandemic.
Of those who contracted Covid-19, Hispanic or Latinx students reported the highest percentage of Covid rates at 21 percent, compared to 16 percent of both white and Black students. Asians and South Asians reported the lowest rate at 5 percent.
Just before starting their first semesters at Harvard, roughly 78 percent of freshmen responded to a Crimson email questionnaire about their backgrounds, beliefs, lifestyles, and experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The anonymous survey explores topics ranging from political ideology to sexual experience to Covid-19’s impact on their mental health. Out of 1,965 students in the biggest class in Harvard’s history, 1,537 responded. The Crimson did not account for potential selection bias in its analysis of the results. Due to rounding, reported statistics may not total exactly 100 percent.
This final installment of The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2025 examines how students have experienced the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, their vaccination trends, and views on coronavirus policy.
Though 14 percent of students reported contracting the coronavirus themselves, nearly 23 percent indicated at least one person in their household contracted Covid-19 since March 2020. Approximately 15 percent of students reported they have had a family member or close friend die from Covid-19.
Students from the Southeast had the highest percentage of those who have had Covid-19 at 16 percent. The Northeast and Midwest reported similar rates at 13 and 12 percent, respectively.
Roughly 24 percent of students whose parents make less than $40,000 annually indicated that they had a close friend or relative who died of the coronavirus. In contrast, only 10 percent of students hailing from households with combined parental income above $500,000 reported a similar phenomenon.
Hispanic or Latinx students reported the highest percentage of those who had a relative or close friend die of Covid-19 at 32 percent, followed by 18 percent of Black students, 12 percent of Asian and South Asian students, and 11 percent of white students.
Some surveyed students also reported the pandemic placing financial strain upon their households. Approximately 9 percent indicated that someone in their household lost their job during the pandemic and 8 percent of students reported having a family member who was furloughed. Hispanic or Latinx students reported the highest rate at 29 percent, compared to 17 percent of Black and Asian or South Asian students.
Of students from families with annual incomes lower than $40,000, 21 percent indicated that one or more members of their households lost jobs, and 16 percent indicated that at least one household member was furloughed. In contrast, only 1 percent of students whose parents make a combined family income of more than $500,000 indicated that they had a household member lose their job during the pandemic.
Adhering to the University’s vaccine mandate for all students, more than 98 percent of freshmen reported having received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, which surpasses the overall undergraduate population vaccination rate of 93 percent. Roughly 96 percent of freshmen have received both doses, while 2 percent of students reported receiving a single dose, according to the survey.
Approximately 77 percent of students received their first vaccine from March to May 2021, while 38 percent — a plurality of students — received their first vaccination dose in April followed by 23 percent in March and 16 percent in May.
Only 15 percent of students reported receiving a vaccine in June or later, while 8 percent had their first dose before March 2021.
Pfizer was overwhelmingly the most popular coronavirus vaccine taken by the freshmen class. Of vaccinated freshmen, 74 percent got the Pfizer vaccine, while 18 percent of vaccinated freshmen received Moderna's.
Moderna tended to be most popular among surveyed students from the Southwest, as 27 percent of students from the region received this vaccine.
Only 5 percent of students received the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine, while 1 percent received the British Astrazeneca vaccine.
An overwhelming majority of students — 89 percent — reported that they still wear masks in public spaces, indoor or outdoor. Per a Harvard policy, undergraduates must wear a mask indoors, regardless of vaccination status. Cambridge reinstated its indoor mask mandate in public spaces on Sept. 3.
Following national trends, political leanings seemed to affect mask-wearing among freshmen — 87 percent of students who identified as “very liberal” or “somewhat liberal” said they typically wear masks in indoor crowded public spaces, in contrast to 56 percent of “conservative” or “very conservative” students.
Roughly 89 percent of respondents said they would continue to wear a mask in all indoor public spaces. Roughly 59 percent said they would still wear a mask in uncrowded indoor spaces, while 57 percent reported that they would wear a mask in crowded outdoor spaces.
Patterns surrounding mask usage in uncrowded outdoor spaces emerged along gender lines. While 11 percent of respondents said they would wear a mask in uncrowded outdoor spaces, of this group, 60 percent were female and 38 percent were male.
Eleven percent of surveyed freshmen said they would not wear masks in either indoor or outdoor settings. Of those who said they would not wear masks, 70 percent were male, while only 30 percent were female.
Mask usage correlated with respondents’ political leanings; five percent of “very liberal” or “somewhat liberal” students reported that they did not typically wear masks in indoor or outdoor public spaces, compared to 40 percent of “very conservative” or “somewhat conservative” students.
