After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LANSING, Mich.—“Though this be madness, yet there is method in it!” Shakespeare, it seems, understood entrepreneurship as well as he did the English language. Fear of being cheated, hunger for new business, obsession with adding unique value, and the satisfaction of loyal teamwork—highly chaotic and unstructured, this has been my summer as an entrepreneur-in-training.
I took this job as a business analyst for a global engineering services startup, hoping that the experience would illuminate the secrets behind starting a successful new business. What makes entrepreneurs tick? How do you build the right team? How do you guarantee a profit—especially when the financial stability of so many families depends on you?
At the moment, while I am neither experienced nor brash enough to drop out of Harvard and try to become a serial entrepreneur, I do know this: the answers to these questions are far from straight-forward; rather, they lie in a mushy goulash of successful experiences, even bigger failures, faith in your team, bravado, gut, an appetite for risk, and—of course—luck.
That being said, I’d like to share the three biggest lessons I’ve learned here:
1. Business is a creative act. I’ve always known that writing and dance could be creative, but I never really imagined that the day-to-day operations of running a business demand similar levels of creativity. There’s no book you can pick up to learn exactly how to write the perfect contract, how to make the most effective sales presentation, or how to pitch terms to a company that you would like to acquire. Instead, there’s a continuous cycle of imagination, adaptation, and trial and error.
2. Business has to be customer-driven. This may seem obvious, but it’s the crucial principle motivating all company action. Competing for business with established players from around the world sometimes feels like hand-to-hand combat. Failure or success is contingent on how we interact with and serve our customers. The more consultative we are in our approach—taking the time and effort to really listen to potential customers, to understand their needs and constraints, and to be flexible in how we do business with them—the greater the benefit to both company and client.
3. Company vision can and should be palpable. Our startup has grown to 150 engineers in a few months and is led by a handful of experienced serial entrepreneurs who really know how to empower those around them. I say “our” startup, even though I haven’t risked any of my own money and don’t have any equity, because everyone here acts and talks like we’re all entrepreneurs, in this together. From the CATIA designer to the president of the company, there’s an “it’s us against the world” attitude that is infectious and, I believe, the lifeblood of the company.
Regardless of the number of rules you could follow in the pursuit of success, after a few months of observing the mindset of the people here, I’ve decided that entrepreneurship is perhaps best boiled down to one word: faith. Faith in yourself, faith in your team, faith that you will find the right solutions when you need them, and faith, especially, that trekking your own path will lead to something better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—I could hear my heart pounding as we approached the cash register. Surrounded by three teenagers and my fellow counselor, Walter, I imagined that this was how a bank robber must feel in the moments before he raises a gun and demands all the money.
I was in charge of these students; if something went wrong, it was up to Walter and me to back them up. The calm I'd felt while going over this scenario on the train dissipated in an instant, and I feigned confidence as the smallest of our students approached the man at the register with self-assurance.
"Are you the manager?” she asked. “We're from the Princeton Summer Journal and we've found some expired products in your store.”
For ten days, I lived and worked with 21 of the best high school journalists from around the country at the Princeton University Summer Journalism Program. These students—many of them people of color, most of them women, and all of them low-income—were taking part in an intensive journalism program designed to get them excited about journalism as a college activity, and maybe even as a career.
They learned that journalists replace sleep with caffeine and late-night conversations that become friendships and devolve, sometimes, into dancing. But the real challenge, I think, was broadening their perspectives: as one of our directors said, journalism is a way of viewing the world.
So for ten days, we encouraged the students to question authority and accepted narratives. We encouraged them to approach problems at their schools without fear and to take on the issues that matter to their student bodies. Most importantly, we treated them like adults. On the last night of the program, several of our students and counselors recited poems of intense honesty and maturity. They learned to be skeptical, to question, and to be truthful, with the intent of improving the world.
Some of these students, I know, won’t grow up to be journalists. But standing there, in a Prospect Park Rite Aid with a basket full of expired baby food, I knew they had internalized the skills requisite to change their communities. And, for the tenth time in as many days, I was inspired by the courage and maturity of my teenage students.

MENTON, France—We were on our way back from Monaco for the last time. When we got into a taxi at dawn, we were still full of laughter. But the sunlight was ominous. “Wake up!” It said. “You’ve been dreaming!”
The sky glowed with haze. The sun was so strict in its movement, it made me nervous. “It’s time to go!” There was no doubt that it was saying, “It’s all over!”
We left the taxi on a road lined with palm trees. My friends and I walked back home in the direction of the Italian border. The railing along the pathway was glistening with dark wet paint. We used to fly down those railings, but now the sign said, “Don’t touch.”
My bags had been packed since the night before, and when I reached the room, I dozed off. I still had to walk to the station to catch my early morning train.
When I woke up, I walked straight onto the balcony. This time, there was nothing very particular about the view of the ocean.
This was not like the time the ocean turned a deep navy blue, making the beachside villas blush an even darker pink.
Nor was the ocean just the right color to blend with the sky.
It was not glittering like it did when it turned into an impassive sheet at dusk.
It wasn’t sparkling from weekend fireworks or glowing with the reflection of the colorful old town.
This ocean was a fuzzy blue, with a few whitecaps. Some of the clouds looked like they could have been boats, far out to sea. I kept looking for something that would make this last scene memorable, but I turned away frustrated.
I left the villa through jasmine-scented breeze. It was morning, and the villa was waking up. Soon I was sitting on a train waiting to head north.
As the hibiscus flowers fell open and the stones dried, the train doors closed and my eyes fell shut. The sun was wrong. I hadn’t been dreaming after all. But now it was time to fall asleep.

A new class offered concurrently this fall at three colleges including Harvard and Yale will feature academics from across the country teaching what course organizers bill as some of the world's most important ideas.
The course, which is offered at Harvard as Freshman Seminar 27e: "Big Ideas," will also be offered to freshmen at Bard College and students at Yale.
Instead of instructors lecturing at chalkboards, the seminar will consist of videos with academics exploring a particular concept from a discipline, from linguistics to statistics, finance to the classics. Interspersed between the videos are essays, readings, and class discussions.
Professor Douglas A. Melton and Professor Nicholas A. Christakis, two of the academics participating in the video lecture series, will lead the course at Harvard.
The class is the product of a joint venture between Peter L. Hopkins ’04 of BigThink and Adam Glick of the Jack Parker Corporation. Together, the two created “The Floating University,” which aims to create courses online like its first course “Great Big Ideas."
“It’s a textbook that has all the pieces of new media,” Hopkins said about the course.
One of the goals of Great Big Ideas, Hopkins said, is to expose new students to as many different areas of knowledge as possible, helping them connect relevant ideas from multiple disciplines and guiding them in their own decisions about future academic paths.
“This is not a substitute for learning on campus,” Hopkins, a former Crimson editor, said. “It’s about saying, ‘What is the way to maximize that?’”
Melton said he hopes that the course will give freshmen exposure to a variety of possible academic fields, including ones they never considered pursuing as a course of study.
“Why would Harvard freshmen need a survey course like this?” he asked. “Many people assume that freshmen come into college knowing exactly what they want to study, but that may not be the case. Maybe they haven’t been exposed to poetry, or molecular biology. It will be nice to have a person who knows about the field give a one-hour lecture, exposing students to the main questions in the field, and how you go about answering them.”
With approximately 30 students, the class will be double the size of a typical freshman seminar class. To facilitate discussion, the students will break up into two groups, each led by one of the seminar professors, to discuss the lecture after watching it in the larger group each week.
As it is the first year the course is offered, the class structure is not set in stone.
“We may also experiment with other formats, and get student input into how best to take advantage of class time and of electronic media for pedagogic purposes,” Christakis said in an email. “We feel that new technologies offer new opportunities for teaching.”
Besides Melton and Christakis, three other Harvard affiliates will be making appearances in the video lectures: research associate Rebecca N. Goldstein, whose lecture discusses epistemology; Professor Steven A. Pinker, who will explore the function of linguistics in understanding brain function; and former University President Lawrence H. Summers, discussing the role of knowledge in education.
“This is a course for everybody,” Hopkins said. “To do one thing well, you need to be able to connect the dots between disciplines, see the big picture, and understand how seemingly different concepts relate to each other. You need to have a diverse toolkit to confront challenges that are out there.”
Hopkins hopes to expand the program to other colleges after this fall’s pilot program. In addition, the lectures will be available to the public by subscription, with certain portions for free.
“Ultimately, we hope we can demonstrate a model that allows the best education to come to as many people as possible, made better through the use of technology, human contact, and the power of exchange,” he said.
