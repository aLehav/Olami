After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renee Zellweger—the Texan actress who has appeared movies ranging from “Bridget Jones’s Diary” to “Jerry Maguire” to “Chicago”—will receive the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Woman of the Year award this upcoming Thursday.
Zellweger mentioned that she would be in Boston this week to receive the award during an appearance on the David Letterman Show last Thursday night.
“That was all her,” said Hasty Pudding Theatricals President David J. Andersson ’09. “We found out about it the next day.”
The Hasty Pudding followed Zellweger’s announcement with a press release Friday morning.
According to Anderson, Zellweger’s broad range of work appealed to the Hasty Pudding’s executive board. 
“When we choose a women of the year, we’re looking for someone who is not only talented and well-esteemed, but who also has a fun side,” Anderson said. “She’s been in both fun, kooky films that fit with the Hasty Pudding spirit and some more well-esteemed films.”
During her day in Cambridge, Zellweger will participate in the Hasty Pudding’s traditional parade down Mass. Ave. The parade will begin at the Inn at Harvard at 2:30 p.m. Zellweger will travel the parade route in a Bentley convertible loaned to the theatrical group by Bentley Motors. 
Andersson and Thomas R. Compton ’09, vice president of the cast for the Hasty Pudding, will sit next to Zellweger in the convertible, while members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—dressed in drag—flank the car. The parade will end at New College Theater on Holyoke Street, where Andersson and Compton will roast Zellweger. 
The celebration will conclude with a preview of “Acropolis Now,” the Pudding’s upcoming show, which opens next week.
The Woman of the Year award was first presented in 1951, and the Man of the Year award was introduced 16 years later. 
“It’s a mix of wanting to bring someone in from the theater community at large and get the experience of talking to her, and allowing us to broaden our horizons and get our name out there,” Andersson said of the award’s purpose.
Andersson said that the main selling point in convincing nominees to accept the award is the list of notable Hollywood figures that have received the award.
Last year, Charlize Theron and Christopher Walken were honored. 
In recent years, the Hasty Pudding has announced both the Man and Woman of the Year simultaneously—last year they did so on the celebrity television program Access Hollywood. 
But this year, the group decided to split up the announcements in hopes of increasing the press coverage each award received, said Hasty Pudding Theatricals Producer Pierce E. Tria ’10. 
The Hasty Pudding plans to announce the Man of the Year on Tuesday or Wednesday of this coming week, Andersson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a gut-wrenching, back-and-forth game at Lavietes Pavilion Friday night, the Harvard men’s basketball team came out on the short end, as the University of Pennsylvania made the clutch plays down the stretch and got the bounces it needed to win 66-60.
Tight throughout a second half that saw three ties and six lead changes, the Quakers (5-10, 1-0 Ivy) took the lead in the final two minutes and held on to it to give the Crimson (9-7, 1-2 Ivy) its second-straight home Ivy loss. Harvard got 14 points and six boards from junior forward Doug Miller and 13 from junior guard Jeremy Lin, but the team was killed by abysmal free throw shooting, hitting just 7-of-16 attempts, including missing the front ends of four one-and-one chances. This came on the heels of a poor game from the foul line in an overtime loss last Saturday to Dartmouth in which the team made just 17-of-27 free throws, including the front ends of several one-and-ones near the end of regulation.
“We just didn’t make foul shots,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ve been one and two in our conference in free throw shooting as a team throughout the season and for whatever reason, things can become very contagious.”
Sophomore forward Jack Eggleston had a game-high 19 points for the visitors and freshman guard Zach Rosen had 15 and nine assists as their team took a huge game between teams hoping for the Ivy League crown.
With the game knotted up 56-56, Rosen faked and drove to the hoop to draw a foul from Lin. Rosen hit both shots and on the other side, his counterpart, freshman guard Oliver McNally had a tough jumper barely rim out, which Penn forward Cameron Lewis tied up for a jump-ball with the possession arrow to his team.
After a time out, the Quakers ran a perfect play as soon after the ball was passed in, Rosen found a wide-open Eggleston for an easy dunk and a 60-56 lead with 1:07. Tough defense on the other end gave the Crimson no chance to score until Lin found Miller for a lay-up with 38.4 seconds to play.
Rosen was fouled with 34 ticks left and knocked down both ends of his one-and-one. Lin then made his first two free throws of the game, before Rosen went back to the line and Penn’s karma took over.
Shooting one-and-one again, the freshman missed the front end, but the ball bounced into the corner near the Penn bench and Eggleston beat Miller to it and called time. Sophomore guard Tyler Bernardini caught the inbounds pass but was gang-corralled and forced to use his team’s last timeout with 22 seconds left.
When the ball came in again, it was batted around several times before Quaker guard Kevin Egee found it along with a straight pass to the basket. Lin fouled him intentionally with 17 seconds left and Egee hit both shots as his team toughed out a wild win.
“We group it all together in toughness—finishing free throws, getting loose balls, blocking out at the free throw line,” Miller said. “For us, it’s all the same. We feel like they were tougher than us today.”
The game began with a wild and sloppy first half. Penn jumped out to a 12-6 lead five minutes in as it constantly beat the Crimson up the floor for baskets. Harvard answered that with a 12-0 run in which it forced four turnovers and watched Eggleston blow an easy two-hand dunk attempt. But the Quakers stayed strong and after Lin missed a lay-up with his team up 27-21 and under three minutes left, they closed out with a 10-0 run, despite another missed dunk, this time by Lewis.
McNally and captain guard Andrew Pusar each missed the front-ends of one-and ones in that stretch as the team made just 1-of-6 attempts in the first half. It also turned the ball over 13 times, which would look worse if the visitors hadn’t gone one further, committing 14 turnovers in the first 20 minutes. In the second half, however, Penn turned it over only twice, compared to six for Harvard, helping the visitors overcome their 44.4 shooting percentage in the game.
“We had a lot of energy in the first half and the turnovers forced were from the energy we brought,” Miller said. “Our energy went down a lot in the second half. That’s something the veterans have to do to keep it going with the team make sure we do so we can win this Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-Princeton rivalry has seen its fair share of end-game drama over the past three years at Lavietes Pavilion. In 2006, the Tigers came back from a 59-53 deficit over the final 1:17 of play to win on a last second jumper, 60-59. Last year, the Crimson used a 20-8 run in the last seven minutes to force overtime and win.Sufficed to say, the Harvard faithful have seen some of the team’s greatest highs and lowest lows in its battles against the Tigers.After a devastating 77-71 loss Saturday night, the Crimson (9-9, 1-3 Ivy) is as close as it’s ever been to being down and out.Expectations were high coming into the weekend, as Harvard was poised to vault itself into the upper echelons of the Ivy standings. After two crippling defeats, the team is left guessing what to do next.“It’s almost like we need to [re]-learn how the win,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “We’re always expecting a close game. We need to play hard for [the full] forty minutes and let the rest follow.”The story of the game was defense—or lack thereof. Coming into the game, Princeton had only mustered sixty points in five of its 14 games. In scoring 77, the squad eclipsed its season average by leaps and bounds.“They hit some tough shots, it wasn’t a lack of effort,” Housman said. “We need to improve on our communication, they confused us.”But the game was still undecided with seven minutes to play, as Harvard took its last lead at 56-54 on two free throws by freshman Keith Wright.From that point on, Harvard couldn’t buy a stop. With the exception of a ten-second violation forced by Housman and two missed free throws, Princeton scored on every trip down court to close out the contest. It posted a 23-15 run to finish the game.
