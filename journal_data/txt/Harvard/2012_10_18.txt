After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years from now, the increasingly cramped, undersized home of Harvard’s   basketball teams will be a thing of the past. As University officials recently announced, a new basketball facility is a large element of its new Institutional Master Plan for Allston.  With projected development between 2017 and 2022, the new arena will replace a building that predates the Great Depression and the site of Harvard basketball games for more than a quarter century. Constructing a replacement for Lavieties Pavilion is a much-needed move, one that will pay dividends to the teams, campus community, and the Allston cityscape.
In the years following Coach Tommy Amaker’s hiring, our men’s basketball team has dramatically improved in performance. Achieving its first berth to the NCAA tournament in 66 years last season, our team has exceeded those of nearly every generation preceding it in quality of play. Although the size of our arena should not be a function of a one team’s success, we cannot ignore the historic level of performance on the part of our Men’s squad. The higher profile of our team, and the accompanying spike in interest, has only made more urgent what has been long overdue for the Ivy League’s second smallest basketball arena.
With a student seating section of about 400, only a fraction of the undergraduate population can physically attend home games. This situation has proven especially problematic to students over the last year, as nearly every home game sold out in the arena.  Limited capacity and frenzied interest have combined to force fans to sit out games while driving up prices for tickets on the resale market to unreasonable levels. Not every home game is televised, leaving interested students unable to participate in what should be as inclusive an experience as possible. A new arena will help address these concerns, while feeding the campus spirit that is an indelible element of any thriving college community.
Also worth noting is the fact that constructing a new facility will economically benefit the Allston neighborhood. Like every construction project, building a new arena will lead to the hiring (or retention) of many local workers. On the other side of the coin, once developed, the arena will help fill some of the space that has for so long remained vacant. Along with the other buildings slated for construction in the area, the arena should help beautify the currently stagnant plot of land that Harvard has failed to completely develop.
In short, with a new stadium, everybody wins.

On Nov. 6, a mere 19 days from now, voters will be asked to make decisions that could change who controls Congress and who lives in the White House. Candidates have little more than two weeks to make their final pitches, while it is becoming increasingly important that voters make up their minds in time for Election Day.
There is only one problem with this scenario:  The election is not merely “approaching.” For tens of millions of voters, Election Day is today. Or tomorrow. Or yesterday. For these citizens of the United States, the term Election Day has become a literal misnomer. The notion that every registered voter in the country carries out his or her civic duty on a single day—by law, the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November—is now a myth. A more honest description of the manifestation of good citizenry would be “election month” or, as some states begin voting a full forty-five days before so-called Election Day, perhaps “election season.”
This is early voting. As of the 2012 election, two-thirds of the states in the Union allow ballots to be cast prior to November 6. These 32 states represent every region of the country. Early voting has quietly become a pervasive feature of the American political process, and it has done so at a detriment to the political system.
On Sept. 6, North Carolina opened the period in which any voter could cast an absentee ballot, regardless of whether or not he or she could provide an excuse for missing Election Day. Not long after, the first states began allowing citizens to actually trek to the poll booths to cast their ballots. This is September we’re talking about. This is before any presidential debates and before most debates for other races. This is before final advertising pushes and many newspaper endorsements. This is before there can even be such a thing as an “October surprise.”
As one might infer, early voting is a relatively recent phenomenon in the modern political cycle. Oregon began hosting entirely mail-in elections in 1998.  Florida’s tradition evolved from reforms after the 2000 “hanging chads” debacle. It was not until 2008 that 80 percent of voters in Colorado decided to cast their ballots prior to Election Day.
This actually harkens back to the original days of choosing electors, when the federal government permitted each state to decide on which day from among a 34-day period before December it wanted to cast its ballots. It was not until 1845 that Congress rectified the inequalities in this system, the same inequalities that exist in the primary election calendar today. States that chose early influenced those that chose later. In close elections, the decisions of the later states carried more import.
In setting a uniform date, Congress ensured that every individual had the same amount of time to ponder his vote, to hear the pleas from the candidates and their surrogates, and to make appropriate travel plans to get to the polls.
In the 20th and 21st centuries, technology has largely transformed the latter concern into a nonissue (although there are certainly those for whom accessing transportation is no easy task). The others rationales, however, still stand. Public opinion surveys of early voters have the ability to irrationally excite or depress a campaign. These unreliable polls (like one giving John Kerry a “large lead in Iowa”) end up distorting the allocation of resources that a candidate would normally spend convincing voters nationwide. In an election in which early voting is permitted, not every voter is created equal. For example, states with a large population of early voters often find themselves frontloaded on candidates’ travel schedules.
As a college student casting my ballot in the state of Pennsylvania, I have no choice but to cast my ballot early. It is only due to the circumstances of college life that I will not be able to physically vote on November 6 in the state I call my home. The same holds true for those serving in the military and those whose work has taken them overseas. Absentee balloting exists for those of us who have situational excuses for truancy on Election Day. It is not meant to be a system for those too busy or too lazy to stop by their local church or elementary school on a Tuesday in November.
Voting used to be an act of community. Neighbors came together in unity to elect their leaders. Now, as citizens treat their ballots as unfortunate pieces of mail on their to-do lists, it is increasingly becoming an act of insouciance. If you cannot make time to make it to the polling place, how much value do you really place on citizenship?
Nov. 6 is Election Day. That sounds so simple. You go in. You make your pick. You leave. Then again, I suppose it would be naïve to assume anything in politics to be that simple. Campaigns are long, drawn out processes. Incumbents are forced to spend time away from their day job—the one in which taxpayers employ them—to hit the trail. Early voting makes the election season even longer. When policymakers are not governing, the nation is hurt. Giving them 30 fewer days to convince the population that they deserve reelection is not ideal. We did, after all, give them a country to run.

They are everywhere. They brush past you as you cross the road into the Yard on the way to class in the morning. They accost you as you duck into Starbucks for a quick coffee. Not a day goes by at Harvard without coming in contact in some way with one of the many transient residents of Harvard Square—our beloved homeless. But should the occupiers of Harvard Square be dismissed so easily, or should we be more sympathetic towards them? It is safe to say that there is a general consensus that the homeless are an integral, albeit exasperating, feature of the Square. But coming in contact with the homeless so often has desensitized students, who often ignore the significant problems associated with homelessness in the Boston area.
In December 2010, Antonio Depina, a homeless man, was arrested for exposing himself in public and urinating in front of several strangers, including one young child, in Harvard Square. For many of us, hearing stories like this is the rule, not the exception. We have all laughed at the man holding the “$ for beer plz” sign. Surely many of us have considered posing for a photo with the cutlass-wielding pirate positioned by the MBTA station. Some of us have even paid the homeless to duck into liquor stores during freshman year.
But the homeless should not be characterized as a mere comical feature of the Square’s landscape. Rather, they should be understood as a manifestation of the problem of homelessness in the United States, including in the Boston area. In December 2011, there were 346 homeless individuals in Cambridge alone. Given the country’s current economic predicament, this problem will mostly likely continue to worsen.
Many students arrive at Harvard having had no contact with the homeless before setting foot in Cambridge. Merely walking through the Square has introduced hundreds of relatively sheltered students to a serious social problem that remains surprisingly prevalent in the developed world.
In fact, many of the “homeless” are not homeless at all. Some of them are street performers who come to Harvard Square to find recognition for their work within Cambridge’s vibrant college atmosphere. Dancers, musicians, and artists alike inject a fresh dose of culture into the Square’s Pit, which would otherwise be a mundane, empty space.
But students sometimes forget to differentiate between the homeless and the performers and simply lump all the people in the Square into one category—annoying, smelly hobos. Thus, performers do not often receive the attention they deserve for their artistic work. Several performers I spoke to expressed indignation over their treatment at the hands of students, who often act condescendingly towards them. They also suspected that students considered them homeless. A friend of mine recently gave a seemingly homeless man a loaf of bread, only to find out that the man on the receiving end was not homeless after all—he simply had a poor taste in clothing.
It is easy to scoff at the excuses that some homeless use to wring some money out of you. However, there may be more to their claims than most of us give them credit for. According to the City of Boston Homeless Census, 85 percent of both temporarily and chronically homeless people in the city suffer from a mental illness, a disabling condition, substance abuse, or a physical disability, all of which require support and attention from society, not isolation and dismissal. Next time you pass by a man carrying a “Gulf War veteran” sign, think twice about laughing at his attire or odor, as 36 percent of homeless veterans are chronically homeless. It is also worth remembering how dangerous are conditions for the homeless as we enter the colder months of the year.
I personally have not given so much as a penny or a glance to any of the homeless in the Square, a habit I picked up back home, where beggars were often stooges for triads, the local mafia in Hong Kong. Although I occasionally feel guilty shrugging off the outstretched hands with the excuse that I have no change in hand, I know that I am not alone in my parsimony or dismissal. Perhaps it is time for that to change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
Like many in the Harvard community, I was baffled by the caricature offered by Daniel Solomon in “The Hillel Problem”. As an adamantly secular Jew, I have only ever felt welcome at Harvard Hillel, a sentiment shared by everyone with whom I’ve spoken—secular, religious, or otherwise.
The portrayal of Hillel as a space dotted with black hats and flowing with long sidelocks is pure canard. If informal surveys of Shabbat dinners are any indicator, a visitor to Hillel is about one hundred times more likely to be Asian than Haredi.
Finally, Mr. Solomon’s call for the Protestantization of Jewish liturgy and ritual misapprehends what it means to be a modern Jew. In this ultra-reform scheme, we are defined by little more than eating bagels, making self-deprecating jokes, and rejecting the divinity of Jesus. Left with this husk of a culture, nonreligious Jews like me would have nothing left for which to stay.
Unlike our beautiful national language, our distinctive dietary habits, or our liturgical poetry, which have stood the test of three millennia, Reform Judaism’s Pittsburgh Platform can soundly be pronounced dead after less than a century of gestation. It is no small wonder why.

To the editor:
I find myself wishing I had some photographs of our most recent Shabbat dinners at Harvard Hillel to send in to the Crimson in constructive response to Daniel J. Solomon’s op-ed on Jewish Orthodoxy and Harvard. Perhaps there is some irony in our respecting ancient and Orthodox practices (shared by many un-Orthodox Jews, like myself) at Harvard Hillel by not taking pictures here on the Sabbath, because otherwise I would be able to show you—as the best possible case for thriving and relevant present-day Jewish culture at Harvard—the company I have enjoyed here on recent Friday evenings.  I have been at pains to make time to sit with our Orthodox students, who frankly feel neglected and underserved here this year, with some justification.
Three weeks ago I shared a table with Jewish members of the women’s rugby team who had brought non-Jewish teammates to experience the meal.  Two weeks ago I was sitting with the heads of our Reform Minyan, whose innovative approach to the confessional spirit of Yom Kippur was just covered by the Boston Globe.
It is possible, in the selfsame moment, for non-Orthodox students to perceive Hillel, and Judaism, to be dominated by Orthodoxy, and for Orthodox students to experience themselves as an embattled minority.  I know of no Solomonic solutions to the familiar blend of identification and antagonism expressed by Mr. Solomon, except to invite him, and all, to take part, actively and without checking one’s own identity at the door (nobody here will ask you to!) in our expanding and multifaceted community.  Jewish tradition teaches that were as many voices of Torah at Sinai as there were people assembled there—and, to continue as vital tradition, we still need every one.

To the editor:
It’s hard to know what to make of Daniel J. Solomon’s op-ed, “The Hillel Problem.” Is his thesis that there are too many Orthodox Jews at Harvard—in which case, I wonder how he would react to a similar statement about Muslims, Mormons, or Catholics? Or, did he simply desire an opportunity to bash a denomination of Judaism that he fundamentally disagrees with, but—as evidenced by his editorial—clearly knows nothing about?
For example, Mr. Solomon insists that Orthodox Jews “busy themselves more with medieval concepts like mesirah—a prohibition on ratting out Jews to secular authorities—than with tikkun olam—the Jewish idea of social justice.” This statement is offensive precisely because it is so ignorant. Had he spoken to a single Orthodox Jew at Harvard, Mr. Solomon would know that while the concept of “mesirah” is completely irrelevant to our daily lives, charity and volunteer work are not. In my time at Harvard, for example, I built houses with Habitat for Humanity, distributed food to the homeless in Cambridge Common, and volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. It is nothing short of demeaning to hear that I could not possibly care about repairing the world because of my Orthodox faith.
Mr. Solomon goes on to say that the differences between Ultra- and Modern Orthodox Jews are “cosmetic,” not “ideological,” and that “there’s nothing modern about having an all-Hebrew prayer book.” Leave aside the fact that the author has clearly never opened the prayer book of Harvard’s Student Conservative Minyan, which—shockingly enough—also happens to be all in Hebrew. Mr. Solomon is apparently unaware that while Ultra-Orthodox Jews discourage attending secular colleges like Harvard, Modern Orthodox Jews aim to interact extensively with the outside world while remaining firmly committed to Jewish law. Tensions between modernity and tradition may often exist for us, but I wish that Mr. Solomon had bothered to research the work of thinkers like Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, and Eliezer Berkovits before baselessly and shamelessly concluding that “there’s nothing modern” about Modern Orthodoxy.
I deliberately attended Harvard instead of a college with a larger Orthodox community because I wanted to interact with Jews different than myself. At Harvard Hillel, for the first time in my life, I encountered and dined with openly gay Jews, Reform Jews, and even unabashedly secular Jews like Mr. Solomon. We often had our disagreements—sometimes heatedly—but every interaction dispelled stereotypes and left me enriched for having expanded my horizons.
Mr. Solomon has four years to spend at this wonderful institution. I urge him to take full advantage of the unique opportunity afforded to him by Harvard Hillel, and venture beyond his comfort zone to interact with Jews that look or think differently than he does. If Mr. Solomon genuinely seeks to combat narrow-mindedness and bigotry among American Jews, he should start by looking in the mirror.

When I first see my grandfather outside of the Würzburg train station, I don’t recognize him. He looks the same—polo shirt, baseball hat, the bright blue eyes that are just like my mother’s—but it’s his new walk, that, in contrast to his previously sure stride, makes me initially look past him.
He does the same with me, briefly, squinting into the sun as he begins to limp past. “Opa!” I have to shout from behind him.
He turns around.“Ach, Gott,” he laughs, Oh, God. “It’s still strange for me to hear you call me that. Am I so old?” As he hobbles over, the slight grimace he makes with each step belies his humor.
The last time I saw my Opa, he was lying in a hospital bed, still telling these bad jokes. Last spring, he was hit by a car while driving on his motorbike—the bike, he shows me in a photograph later, was broken into three separate pieces, the metal crushed into itself and split, the Swiss-army knife inside his pocket warped into a 90-degree angle. My grandfather flew 20 meters through the air before he touched ground. He broke more bones than we can count. In Intensive Care for six weeks, he was only sometimes conscious, but he finally recovered: Now, he’s something of a walking miracle to doctors and nurses and me—we who thought he might not make it.
It’s my grandfather—who used to run marathons, train for triathlons, and climb mountains—that stands as the only person unhappy with his recovery. “I’m a cripple,” he’ll say, laughing, but there’s an undertone of despair. “I can only bike, nothing else.”
“Mensch, war das ein Sturtz.” Man, what a fall.
So we spend the week biking—45 kilometers the first day after I arrive, through the open fields for hours, racing through grass as high as we are, the wind at our backs propelling us on. The next day we bike around the corner to the grocery store to pick up avocados and strawberries; the next, 10 kilometers into town for coffee, and then to the drugstore.
It’s my first time riding in a few years, and Opa’s old bike is a little too big for me: I wipe out in the middle of the grocery store parking lot. I’m pretty much stationary when it happens, too, and Opa just looks at me and shakes his head. They say you can’t forget how to ride a bike; I’m skeptical.
It’s the only time I’ve been alone with Opa, I realize, and so he speaks to me in English at first. It’s my biggest failure to him, that I’m not fluent in German. Now the language I knew before English so often gets jumbled in the back of my mouth and, over-thinking every article and conjugation, I freeze. I can only understand, not speak. I still try, though: “Wir sollten nur Deutsch reden,” I say one night at dinner. We should only speak German.
There’s something about translation, the ability to switch seamlessly between two modes of meaning, that seems unattainable—but my grandfather does it well.He worked at an American school in Germany after the War, teaching English and history for years, and now, he sees hope in re-teaching his granddaughter her first language. “Is relearning a language like riding a bike?” I joke.
“Das Fahrrad, not der,” he says. You just have to know these things. Remember them. For the rest of the week, we switch back and forth between the two languages: “Links,” he shouts out at a street corner, and ahead of him, I turn my bike left.
On my last day in Germany, we go on a final bike ride after dinner. We fly through wheat and corn fields, the perfect squares of farmland, the expansive sky; I’m rolling over the smooth bike path one last time, and I swear I’m thinking in German, that the words would fly out perfectly into the landscape, I’m sure, but for now they’re contained within the thin track of two wheels tracing over pavement.
It’s late August, and although up here the sun doesn’t set until past 10 p.m., there are already leaves that have started to flutter to the ground, crunching under my bike. It feels, suddenly, like the end of summer. The end of something, at least.
“Bye, Delphine,” he says at the train platform the next day.
“Tschüss, Opa,” I say back. We hug. A smile—or a wince, I can’t tell—and I’m back home, my German crumpled once again into the back of my brain.
Tschüss, it means goodbye. When I was younger and still carrying a German accent of my own, I didn’t realize it wasn’t English. When I found out it was German, that not everyone understood, I was oddly upset. I think the discovery meant it could now never mean all that I wanted it to: It was useless, a broken word.

Stephen Zedros picks and chooses stem after stem, sweeping extra foliage away in a brush of the hand, placing each bright flower carefully into its arrangement. Pincushion proteas, gerberas, dahlias, cherry brandy roses, and finally, thin branches of hypericon berry, seem to have grown into the vases spontaneously, beautiful.
It’s a rainy day, and the interior of Brattle Square Florist provides a haven from the mist outside; sheltered customers walk over the stems and leaves scattered across the ground of the small space and under hanging plants, browsing among bright colors and the smell of old wood and petals.
In the dim light, behind a main counter cluttered with old receipts and crumbled order papers, Zedros says that these are his favorite tasks. “I like to use seasonal flowers like these,” he says, describing his approach to filling these vases that swell with color. “As soon as the first frost comes—which is tonight, actually—they’ll be gone.”
It seems effortless, the way Zedros can identify each stem, rattling off its prime season, but he’ll tell you that running Brattle Square Florist, the Harvard Square business located at 31 Brattle, is far from it. Zedros differentiates his store from other florists by stressing the large variety of flowers carried, around 300 types daily, and its ability to meet the changing and immediate needs of customers—like the one for whom Zedros is preparing a seasonal arrangement right now, who walked in off the street. “You’ve got to be prepared,” he insists, and so he’s making up this combination as he goes.
Zedros has been managing Brattle Square Florist for around 15 years, enough time to have adjusted to meet requests like these, but only a chip in the shop’s long history: The family business has been running for over 99 years, since it was opened back in 1913. “Yeah,” he laughs, a sudden chuckle, “a long time, isn’t it?”
When the shop first opened, he says, it sold produce along with its flowers. Customers loved corsages of scented petals—one of the most popular items back then—and much of their business occured before football games or on Sundays for church events.  In the seventies, the shop separated into two locations for more space, with the florist still based at Brattle Street. Zedros explains that, because the work is so labor-intensive, the business decided to pursue their flowers alone, turning their attention to their location within Harvard Square.
“We have all these flowers out here,” Zedros says, pointing at the rows and rows of roses, sunflowers, and orchids, stacked on different shelves, only leaving a thin aisle’s worth of empty space in the middle of the store, “but no one thinks about how long it takes to get them out.”
Working 13-hour days, Zedros and his family and friends who work at the shop typically begin making phone calls around 7:00 a.m. to confirm orders and shipment deliveries, and arrive at the shop at eight to start preparing for the day. Today’s shipment, around 20 boxes of flowers, took five hours to fully prepare. The process involves unpacking, stripping stems of foliage, cutting and placing them in water with solution, and refrigerating around half of the flowers, which will not be immediately sold. The 7:00 p.m. closing time is “only a technicality,” Zedros says. He doesn’t usually get out of the store until around two hours later.
This, of course, excludes the holidays during which business explodes: graduation, Mothers’ Day, or Valentine’s Day, when lines have grown out the door until they reached Crema Café, a few businesses down the road. Delivery requests increase 10 times on Feb. 14, so work hours are extended from 6:30 a.m. until around 10:00 p.m. that night.
Zedros, a tall, friendly man whose brown eyes echo the warm atmosphere of the shop, sort of fell into this business. He attended college at Boston University, and started working at the shop after graduating when he sensed it needed some help. Before him, his uncle Ted Gomatos—he gestures toward the back of a shop, where Gomatos is presumably working—was a manager. Zedros’ mother, Catie, who shuffles past the counter wearing a jacket and a winter hat (“Oh, I’m freezing!” she tells the customer she’s helping), has been working on and off at the florist for 60 years. Zedros learned the trade “by eye,” he says: “A lot of people go to school for this,” but not him. He notes a customer who is looking impatient to leave. “Tommy, she’s in a rush!”
Tommy appears from the curved staircase that leads upstairs, where ribbons and wrappings emerge from over the banister, and the more intricate flower arrangements are designed, to help the appreciative customer.
“Sorry,” Zedros continues, smiling. “You were asking?” He is cut off once again by a man, grinning, who who carries a huge bouquet of flowers out of the shop: “How in the world am I going to carry all these?”
A staple of Harvard Square, and perhaps one of the only locales that reflects its fading authenticity, Brattle Square Florist has a long list of regulars, plus a core group of around 20 customers that Zedros sees each week. During the recession, of course, these numbers went down, but Zedros says that they are rising once again. The most frequent visitors are the kind of people that want fresh flowers for their offices, then long-term customers like professors, even University President Drew Faust.
Occasionally there are the rarer guests that drop by during visits to Cambridge: senators, or the prince from Saudi Arabia who ordered his daughter’s name in roses, five feet high, for her sixteenth birthday. And even more elaborate requests, like that of another customer Zedros remembers, who ordered 10 deliveries of a dozen roses to the same address at half-hour intervals.
A phone is ringing somewhere, and Catie goes to answer it: Like old-fashioned landlines, it’s stuck onto a wall, almost lost among leaves and buds. Something about a wrong address, which both mother and son immediately work to correct.
For the future, when this team might not be able to work side by side, Zedros says he is considering finding a partner and placing more direct advertisements (for now, “We take out no ads.”) to keep up with other businesses and the demands of the Square. He does not know whether his own children, ages 12 and 14, will want to go into the family business but he does not seem concerned.
There are things that endure despite change: “The energy of the Square keeps you young,” Zedros says. “The Square never stops, so it’s always fun.” He talks about customers who come back for reunions, and being able to watch so many grow up—that, too, is one of his favorite aspects of running the flower shop.
It’s the same personal, face-to-face business that greets the many who do come back years later, to pick up a bouquet or two. “Wait,” Zedros could easily call out as you leave, as he does today. “Let me just wrap you up some roses.” Three, with white-petals and red edges that curl upward, are swiftly wrapped into white paper and handed over. “Take these with you,” he insists. “It’s no problem.”

“…The mercenary process of producing and distributing obscene literature is immoral and noxious, is an offense against civilized society, is a thing to be punished, prohibited, and prevented."
The year was 1911, and Harvard President Charles W. Eliot ’53 was addressing the 33rd annual meeting of the Watch and Ward Society.
Eliot’s unabashed defense of book banning is a far cry from Harvard’s current attitude: A century later, the same titles Watch and Ward pushed off shelves grace the syllabi of Harvard courses. As the nation celebrated Banned Books Week from September 30 to October 6, the Harvard Bookstore introduced a new line of 10 banned novels, now classics, printed on its very own book-making robot, the Paige M. Gutenborg machine.
Jamie Dondero, manager of the bookstore’s print-on-demand department, spearheaded the project. “It brings an awareness to us that, though we may not see it here, books and creative thought and art is being censored in our country and worldwide,” he said.
Harvard, however, hasn’t always been a haven for artistic and literary freedom.
WATCH AND WARD
The Watch and Ward Society, founded in 1879, served as the driving force behind Boston’s puritanical censorship policies, and made “Banned in Boston” a national byword. Among the society’s founders were Reverend William Lawrence ’71 and Reverend Philips Brooks ’55. Godfrey Lowell Cabot ’82, served as treasurer from 1915 to 1940. The Society’s list of contributers includes influential University surnames like DeWolfe, Leverett, Peabody, Lowell, and Wigglesworth.
Many Harvard undergraduates bemoaned the restrictive policies. “No one would object to Venetia Vardon having loved twice except the Boston censors, who have banned the book,” read a 1927 review of “Young Men in Love” in The Crimson. “I am afraid that Swift, Fielding, Defoe and many of our other great English novelists would have made a scant living in this state.”
James A. Delacey, then-manager of the Dunster House bookshop, was arrested for selling an illicit copy of “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” to a Watch and Ward member in 1930. When his sentence was remitted, he received over 200 congratulatory notes, according to a Crimson article from the time. “A splendid victory over the smut hounds,” an article read. Another applauded Delacey on his “escape from the clutches of moral snorters.”
In 1964, when the Massachusetts Attorney General banned “Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,” its sales broke records in Harvard bookstores, according to The Crimson. The Attorney General’s office threatened to prosecute bookstores in Harvard Square for continuing to offer the book after a court-ordered halt on sales.
 THE "X CAGES"
The Boston bans made pornographic literature and art valuable on the black market, and vigilante Watch and Ward members were wont to take censorship into their own hands. Unguarded erotica was quick to disappear from Harvard’s open stacks, so the university moved its endangered material into two “X cages.” Pornographic literature including “The Joy of Sex” and back issues of “Playboy” was safeguarded alongside rare books in the Widener cage; art books with titles like “Fully Exposed: The Male Nude in Photography” and “The Grotesque in Photography” were kept with rare art in the stacks beneath Littauer.
In 1946, an enterprising Crimson reporter decided to investigate whether the books were actually available to students. To access Harvard’s copy of “Memoirs of Hecate County,” a bestselling novel banned in Massachusetts for its explicit depictions of sex, he found that students were required to submit to interviews with Foster M. Palmer, assistant librarian in charge of the Reference Section. “Sufficient reason must be given for the desire to read the book before an appointment can be had to see it,” the article explains.
Some students found alternative means into the forbidden collection. A 1958 Crimson article reports that librarians sometimes found books knocked to the X cage’s floor by students who had reached sticks or poles from a lower level through a narrow opening in the floor of the cage.
Amanda Bowen, Head of Collections at the Fine Arts Library, is careful to note that the cage did not exist to protect the morals of prurient bookworms. The libraries were concerned about thieves and censors, not curious students. “It wasn’t a get-your-rocks-off kind of thing,” she says.
 NOTHING INDECENT IN THE STACKS
Today, getting into a fabled “X cage” requires neither break-in nor interview. Upon request, FM went on an informal tour of a cage located in the bowels of Littauer. Anticlimactically, it bears close resemblance to the open stacks in Widener—the only discernible difference is a locked gate—and there’s nothing racy to be found.
As loosened mores and internet access have made pornographic art and literature more accessible, Harvard has responded to decreased demand by emptying both X cages of their lewd material. Obscene literature moved to the depository in Southborough in the nineties, and pornographic art has migrated into open stacks over the past decade.
The room is now crammed floor-to-ceiling with rare manuscripts, photographs, and antique scrolls. Bowen gestures at the shelves. “We used to put naked pictures here, but it’s the same stuff you see on the Internet every day,” she says. “Erotica is not exotic anymore.”

Steven Johnson is one of the most influential popular science thinkers of our time. The author of eight books, including “Everything Bad is Good for You: How Today’s Popular Culture is Actually Making Us Smarter” and “Where Good Ideas Come From,” and co-founder of three websites, Johnson talked to FM about hunches, heroes, and the human experience in an urbanizing world.
1. You majored in semiotics at Brown. What does that mean?
 Semiotics was effectively a media studies major with a heavy dose of French twentieth century philosophy. You were interpreting the world of media and the world of advertising, and it was as if there was a secret code that you could use to make sense of them, a hidden meaning in all these popular forms. But it set me up very nicely for when the web first really blossomed in the mid-ninties. I had spent all of this time studying media and thinking about hypertextuality in traditional books, and suddenly there was this hyptertext medium that actually was real hypertext.
2. At this point you’ve written eight books, spanning in subject matter from a cholera outbreak in 19th century London to why videogames are engaging. How do you decide what to write?
In my last book I talk about the slow hunch. You have these ideas where you start thinking about them a little bit in the back of your mind, or somebody says something to you that plants one seed, then two years later somebody else plants another seed, and if you keep those hunches alive eventually they hit a critical mass. They eventually get to this point where they start gathering up and they’re like this swarm that you can’t ignore anymore.
3. What underlying themes unite your books?
I used to think of my books as being very different. But when I was writing “Where Good Ideas Come From,” I consciously thought of that book as a trilogy with “Ghost Map” and “Invention of Air,” both of which were books of world-changing ideas and the environments that made them possible. Those were case studies in innovators of the past, and “Good Ideas” was the theory. But then I finished and realized that all of my books had been about innovation in some way or another. They were about new ideas that were coming into being and new scientific developments, new forms of entertainment or media.
4. Where do you see your work fitting into the current intellectual landscape?
I used to think of myself as a public intellectual in the sense that I was trying to write for both a popular audience and an academic audience. Like in “Everything Bad is Good for You,” I was trying to write a book that would be interesting to people who were teaching media theory classes and also interesting to 15 year olds who wanted to convince their parents that video games weren’t rotting their brains. It’s hard to write on those levels. What changed and surprised me was that I ended up having this other side of my career of building things, of doing these web companies and web products or tools over the years.
5. And how did you become involved in those initiatives?
I’d always been really interested in computers, and this is one of those things where generationally it’s really funny to think back, but when I was in college, computers were not cool at all. I was really into my Mac—I was into all of that page layout stuff—but my friends were all art kids so they would come by and I’d be like, “You’ve gotta see this new program!” And they were like, “Steven, don’t show that to people. That’s really not cool.”
6. You’re a science and technology writer with almost 1.5 million followers on Twitter, which is pretty incredible. How do you attract and retain so many followers?
So when Twitter first came along—this is one of my weird little early adopter things—I kind of bet on Twitter. I was like,  “I can’t be on Facebook and on Twitter,” so I’m going to go with Twitter. Twitter had this problem where if you signed up and you weren’t following anybody it was useless, so they had to create an on-ramp to teach users how to use the service from day one. They created this thing called the “Suggested User List,” and initially it was a list of 40 people to follow. And because of some combination of I was using it as an author, and frankly they knew me a little bit, they put me on this list. As Twitter’s growth exploded, so did my follower count. I get new followers all the time, but now every time I tweet something I lose 30 followers. So it’s a little bit depressing and it’s also a little bit of stage fright: You’re like, “Oh my God no more drunk tweeting.”
7. Who do you follow? Who are your intellectual heroes?
One of them is E.O. Wilson with his book “Consilience.” Consilience is Wilson’s argument that we need interpretive systems that are kind of stacked on each other. So in the sciences, the physicists can talk about how atoms are built, then the molecular biologists can talk about how those atoms form molecules, then the cell biologists can talk about the cellular system, and then the organ level biologists can talk, and then you can talk to ecosystem scientists and each system can exist independently but they kind of talk up and down to each other. And that process of layering knowledge is what he calls consilient thinking. That’s something I’ve tried to do very consciously since I read that book many many years ago in the writing I do.
8. Your newest book, “Future Perfect”, claims that peer networks, like big governments and big markets, are effective systems for catalyzing social progress. What can college students do to maximize their peer networks?
We have this assumption in our society that innovation just comes from people being competitive and having proprietary stakes in things and ownership. That is true in some places, but it is also true that you can get comparable levels of innovation and creativity by not restricting the ideas and by not claiming ownership of them because other people are free to improve on them. A big theme behind that is diversity as an engine of innovation. That’s the thing I think about in terms of being a student, and particularly being a student in a place like Harvard. The rest of your life the world is going to try and specialize you. They’re going to try to make you focus on one thing, one silo, one department and become an expert at it. And there’s a role for that, but there are a lot of problems that we have that we can’t solve within the vantage point of a single discipline. And when you’re in college you have this opportunity to build interpretive bridges between disciplines. You can’t tell the whole story of what happened or how the world works without making those connections.
9. A lot of your writing advocates for the city as a hub of human development and innovation. How will the increasingly urbanized human experience affect us?
There was a period of time when we saw the favelas and shanty-towns and everything and we would think, “Oh my god, that’s terrible.” But what we’ve started to realize now is that even as these conditions persist they’re turning out to be very progressive forces. And what happens when people move from the country to the city is that you see this immediate drop in fertility rates, people have far fewer kids. That’s partially because they don’t have enough room, partially because they have access to birth control, and also that the economic incentives to have more kids change from when you’re living a rural life. You see a tremendous improvement in the female entry into the workforce. So the urbanization of the planet may be the single thing that ultimately saves us from runaway population growth.
10. How should we be preparing to thrive in this newly urbanized world?
If you and I had been having this conversation in 1995, a lot of people at the time were saying, the internet is going to come along and transform society and nobody’s going to want to live in cities anymore because they can just telecommute. The internet’s going to be the death of distance. And that ended up being completely wrong-headed because the internet gets more and more useful the bigger your city. The internet is not just about connecting people who are far away from each other, but about actually exploring the space you live in. And when people were thinking about the internet they were thinking, “Oh, you’ll be able to order on Amazon or telecommute to their office,” but they didn’t ever think about Foursquare, they didn’t ever think,  “there’s going to be this thing showing what’s going on around me on my phone using GPS.” It’s not just that it’s an exciting time to live in a city, but that we have all these tools now which will help us actually make these cities more engaged, creative, and responsive places.

We were laughing so hard my parents thought we were drunk—which given that it was 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, would not be unheard of.
But after checking all the bottles in their liquor cabinet (and—with some foresight—the rubbing alcohol in the medicine closet) my parents realized that their daughter and her childhood friend were, in fact, not intoxicated.
The question of whether or not we were on recreational drugs was never asked.
We were merely high on the natural (I’m using a liberal definition here) pleasure that comes from temporarily covering your body with images of flaming guitars and flowering skulls.
That’s right. I’m talking temporary tattoos. Or, as I like to call them, “tats.”
My experimentation with tats began on a typical August afternoon in Fairfield, California. I love my hometown; we have the Jelly Belly Factory and a mall. Inside the mall, we even have an American Eagle, and one of those “As Seen on TV” stores. But we don’t have much else.
Consequently, the only two things that kids normally do for fun in my town is make babies or get tattoos (or a combination of the two—Baby Tats are a growing trend).  And, after debating whether or not I wanted my baby to be born a Taurus—the Zodiac sign would make a sweet Baby Tat—I decided against the former and got tatted up instead.
So, after a five-hour trip to the mall, my friend Polly and I did what any self-respecting 19 year olds would do: We covered ourselves from head to toe in “Rock ‘n Roll Rockstar” tattoos.Perhaps we should not have gone with the pack of 60.
At one point I had 20 on my skin, and at least five of them were on my hands.
I was especially proud of the flaming skull on my thumb. I called it the thumb of death.
Everyone else called it a clear sign of my mental deterioration.
I prefer the thumb of death.
I know it’s been years since most normal people have seen a temporary tattoo, but I think it’s time we bring back the trend and expand it to more social gatherings and holidays. Who wouldn’t want a temporary tattoo themed wedding?
My goal was to host a Tattoo Party at Harvard. I started a collection in preparation. I went to the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco, in search of some quality tats. After passing by multiple tattoo parlors and “licensed” street inkers I finally found an art store that sold quality temporary tattoos. I also had my younger cousin send me a few that she didn’t want anymore—she said something about them not being cool in middle school.
I greatly underestimated the maturity of my friends, who, despite my vast collection, were not particularly impressed by the party I registered: TattyTimez2012.
One of my friends stole my thunder by designing his own “real”  tattoo, which will be a combination of turtles and the German saying Das Grosse Dasein—which I like to believe translates into English as “tramp stamp.”
But I think my friends greatly underestimate the magic of temporary tattoos, and I’m not just alluding to the fact that the majority of mine involve mythical creatures.
Rather, I am now going to reference one of my favorite movies: When I use temporary tattoos I feel like Peter Pan.
And it is not just because I can fly.
I feel like Peter Pan because I don’t have to grow up. I’m in Never Never Land, where I’m not a college student; I’m a Lost Boy. I am a younger (still female) version of myself that doesn’t have to worry about finals, concentrations, or overdue library books.
I don’t have to think about the fact that I have no idea what I am doing with my life, I can just think about where this exploding guitar would look best on my body. Which would be on my thumb.
It’s immature, yes, but that’s the point. Who says I have to be mature? I mean other than my parents, my teachers, and my imaginary friend Charles. I have the rest of my life to read the newspaper over coffee and talk about what Doctor Oz said on his latest show. I can always grow up later, or when I’m dead. That’s a saying, right?
Some may say I am evading my responsibilities; that, by engaging in such a hedonistic and childish practice I am running away from my full potential and denying the fact that I have to someday grow up. I should take full responsibility for my actions, get a job or start a family or adopt a dozen cats. I shouldn’t be hiding under a thin layer of transferred glue and ink.
The thing is that I am not running away or hiding from my inevitable future full of cats and Baby Tats, I am just taking a break. Because that is the beauty of temporary tattoos, they’re just that: temporary.
—Nicole J. Levin is a sophomore in Dunster House. She currently has 11 (temporary) tats, 8 of which are of cats.

Sims: They’re just like us. I first realized this as I sat awake at four in the morning on my twentieth birthday, watching my virtual doppelgänger celebrate her own passage from “teen” to “young adult,” with an eerie shock of recognition. In a moment of weakness, I had bought The Sims 3 for myself as an early birthday present instead of studying for my art history midterm. Back at the “party,” my Sim self yawned and then, with her house still crowded with shouting and dancing friends, snuck upstairs and collapsed into bed.
The Sims was supposed to be a retreat from reality, but I was wrapped up in a bout of coming-of-age anxiety. “Teen angst” could no longer explain away my every woe, or “adolescent stupidity” excuse my behavior. Twenty seemed an unavoidable marker of adulthood, and what better way to thumb my nose at that than by immersing myself in the fantasy of a game I spent my whole childhood coveting? As a 10 year-old with a rickety Mac, I cherished visits to the houses of friends lucky enough to own The Sims.
But playing with friends was eternally dissatisfying. One friend was interested only in watching Sims get into vicious fistfights. Another liked to trap Sims in swimming pools with a diving board but no exit ladder, leaving them to slowly drown. The Sims is rated “T for teen” for a reason.
I fixated on creating perfectly-proportioned Sim couples, surrounding them with beautiful objects, and watching them on their inevitable paths to love. Each Sim house was a little piece of paradise. Every moment of in-game happiness was a thrill. There was nothing like watching a couple’s first “WooHoo!” beneath the sheets, amidst a cloud of pink hearts.
When I returned to the world of The Sims this week, it seemed to have lost some of its brightness. Sims could miss deadlines and get fired from jobs. Couples split up. Everyone eventually got old and died. I could still immerse myself in the virtuality of their world—and did, for eight straight hours—but it wasn’t a perfect escape any longer. Quitting out of my game to watch a movie was a relief—at least the characters weren’t speaking Simlish.

Salman Rushdie spoke at the First Parish Church last Tuesday at an event hosted by the Harvard Book Store. Rushdie, dapper in his dark grey suit, spoke about his recently published work: “Joseph Anton: A Memoir,” and the experience of living under a fatwa.
1. “Stories are not true. These things never happened. ‘Madame Bovary’ is fictional in the same way magic carpets are fictional.”
2. “Sometimes the writers you define yourself against are as important as those you seek to be like.”
3. “Learning that fiction is fiction liberates you to write any way you want.”
4. On why his memoir is in the third person: “It helped me see that writing the Self requires the same process of coming to life as it does for a fictional character.”
5. “Growing up multi-lingual instilled in me a playfulness about language—that you could jump from language to language, that you can be thinking in one language and substitute with a word from another.”
6. “What happened to me came to feel novelistic. There was a story in it: a beginning, middle, and end.”
7. “You live with policemen long enough—they have a very black sense of humor—and it begins to rub off.”
8. On his $3.3 million bounty: “I’ve spent my life among novelists who are all short on money and no one’s tried to collect.”
9. Commenting on the Iranian computer game designed around his life, and his depiction therein as a whiskey-drinking whip-bearer who tortures people by reading to them from “The Satanic Verses”: “If it weren’t for the fact that this stuff wasn’t funny, it’d be funny.”
10. Interviewer: “Are you for real?” Rushdie: “No, we’re fiction.”

People say there’s no place like Harvard Square. Red brick, iconic restaurants, and international leaders draw thousands to the Square every day. Despite the Square’s uniqueness, there are elements that connect it with cities across the United States. Over the course of the semester, FM will share some of the “Secrets of the Square,” the little noticed and often overlooked features so foundational to its brick-toned character.
Little neon men are pressed into the pavement at street corners throughout the Square. These mysterious figures are called “stikmen,” and no one knows exactly when they arrived in Cambridge. Two decades ago, an anonymous artist known as “Stikman” started placing stikmen in New York, before expanding his project to other cities.
The art came to my attention only recently. I am the type of person that tends to look where I am walking, but there are those days when I’m looking down at a study sheet in my hand, trying to cram before a midterm. It’s then that I met my first stikman—on Mass. Ave. by the crosswalk connecting Out of Town News to Harvard Yard.
Later, I walked into Out of Town News to ask if anyone knew anything about the robot-like images. The two men behind the counter said they had never noticed. I tried the Coop, Bob Slate, Black Ink, Cardullo’s, but no one could give me an explanation besides the fact that they have been there for a while.
It was the Cambridge Office of Tourism that directed me to a blog about these stikmen, and from there, I uncovered the artist’s online following. What I thought was another one of those unique art exhibits in Harvard Square turned out to be a presence in New York, Philadelphia, and even Boston.
The artist celebrated the 20th anniversary of his street graffiti project this year. For a special exhibit at a gallery in Brooklyn, New York, he shared his desire for his pieces to come alive in public places. “It finds an indigenous space in our surroundings like a flower escaping from the crack in a sidewalk. Continuously altered by time and circumstance,” he wrote.
Harvard Square has been an office to famous men and women since its inception. But Stikman continually brings mystery and merriment to the Square every day. So look down, pause, smile, and walk on.

As summer’s warmth is replaced by fall showers and stiff breezes, all but the most dedicated students have abandoned Harvard’s outdoor spaces in favor of hot cider and common rooms. Unfortunately, the aforementioned “most dedicated students” include those playing the latest collegiate fad: spikeball.
For the blissfully unaware, spikeball is the quasi-athletic trend sweeping through Harvard faster than a cold during midterm season. Two teams of two stand on opposing sides of a hula hoop containing a taut, trampoline-like fishing net and awkwardly bounce a child-sized volleyball back and forth.
Though its proponents claim the game is a mix between volleyball and four square, spikeball lacks both the graceful athleticism of the former and the nostalgic charm of the latter. What’s left is a herky-jerky mess of splayed limbs, muffled grunts, and grass stains that, in terms of all-around goofiness, falls somewhere between the Harvard Quidditch Team and barefoot running.
Spikeball is not without its charms. With fast-paced rounds and ample amounts of trash talking, it’s easy to see why the game is so addicting. But the game’s designer apparently sought inspiration in a fourth grader’s toy chest. Hula hoops, neon yellow supports, and more assembly required than the latest IKEA catalogue? Let’s stick to Frisbee.
Finally, there’s the obvious logical flaw at the heart of the game: Why is the trampoline even necessary? Brace yourself because I’m about to use my Harvard-level critical thinking skills to drop a knowledge bomb: balls bounce. Ditch the trampoline and put the hoop directly on the ground. Bam! Spikeball is now 200 percent cooler. You’re welcome.

THE SABLIÈRE SOCIETY
President: So, the date event was—
Senior member: Oh my god! Your sweater is, like, so cute.
President: Oh my god, thank you! I got it at the J. Crew off of Newbury Street, and it was between this and another one and I couldn’t decide so I texted my mom pictures of both, and she was, like, get both! And so I did! And I got these earrings at Anthro, and I thought they were on sale, but they weren’t, but I got them anyway. Oops!
Sophomore punch: I think I saw one of the other punches wearing the same sweater earlier. Isn’t sweater season the best!?
President: Cut that bitch.
THE PHOENIX 
Treasurer: Thoughts on making Mark Zuckerberg an honorary member?
President: Really? Are you really going to propose this at every meeting?
Treasurer: Look. Come up with something better if you don’t like it! We’re running low on cash. If you really want to send the punches to Botswana for the weekend to get you an elephant tusk, we’re going to need some more cash.
President: Fine. Give him a poke.
THE DELPHIC
Punchmaster: So let’s talk about these punches. First up is Johnson. I think we have to take him. Anyone have any comments?
Junior member: Um…I saw him piss on the floor of the basement last weekend….
All: FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Junior member: But—
All: [Unintelligible screaming]
Punchmaster: He’s in.
THE SIGNET
Membership Chair: How do we all feel about this application?
Senior member: The essay is rather trite, I think. Very reliant on em-dashes, certainly; misplaced modifiers all over the place. I don’t get any sense of the sort of deep artistic introspection that we’re looking for.
Membership Chair: Yes, I agree. And the em dashes are a bit heavy-handed, to be sure. And let’s be honest: who uses the word “dovetail” anyway?
Senior member: Yeah, I think it’s a no. Plus, we definitely don’t need another Advocate member. It all just feels a bit… I don’t know… derivative? I mean, he’s no Mark Chiusano.
 THE OAK CLUB 
Botany Chair: OK guys, I’ve got some really lovely cedar saplings for us this week!
President: All right! Great, great. And the elms we planted last month?
Botany Chair: Coming along nicely. We had a couple guys out there to water them this past weekend, and we’ve gotten some really great responses from the community!
President: Awesome! Nice work, guys!

Dearest readers, 
It grieves me to say that I can no longer keep this going. It has come to my attention that The Crimson Weatherboard’s Weekly Weather Reviews are costing The Crimson more per letter than any other publication in the history of weather-related literature. It is simply not feasible for us to keep publishing my musings on the weather without further funding which, for legal reasons, cannot be in U.S. dollars. In fact, the only currency the Business board will accept at this time are Facebook likes and shares, and this, dear reader, is where you come in. I hereby announce the beginning of Operation Weather Truth Forever, or for short, Operation WTF. Your mission: Like the Weekly Weather Reviews of previous last week’s weathers to increase the value of the shares, then tell your friends to do the same until we break even (my accountants have estimated this to be in the range of 5k likes per review). If you don’t have friends, feel free to make a new Facebook account just to like us more. It’s okay, we know you’re doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.
Yours in need,
Mr. Weatherman, Esq.
This week, in what is potentially the last installment of this week’s last week’s weather, we talk about the weather from last week potentially one last time:
Mother visited last week, telling me I looked fat. I told her the same, but at least my fat will keep me insulated against the Cantabrigian frost while she swelters in the Florida sun. Overall, it was a good visit. Her comments reminded me of two things: One, I need to keep shoveling HUDS tater tots into my stomach to help build up a reservoir of fatty energies to survive my winter igloo home; and two, I need to find that tree I buried last year so I can fuel my bonfire this Halloween.
The weathervane atop the Crimson pointed south earlier this past week, signaling that everything is turning to shit now that Canada is blowing on us. “It’s a bit nippy out,” the passersby announce, lamenting with what might be the world’s most ill-thought-out cold-related word. Seriously, who the hell decided it was OK to use the word “nippy” to describe anything other than a mammalian teat? I bet it was those damn editors of college publications. “Let’s ruin the weather for everyone,” they whisper to each other, gesticulating to their nipples and guffawing with vitriol. Maybe I’m just angry because “nippy” weather is the only nip I get to experience these days. I need to find a girl, dammit. I should really consider asking one of those pretty editors out on a date—maybe then they would buy me dinner before bending me over the table and having their way with my column and me. Then again, they might actually ask me to pay for dinner, but I don’t think Chipotle takes Facebook likes for credit.
WTF!

You could call it a match made in heaven, if either of them believed in such a place. At her editor’s wedding reception, self-described “Olympian smoker” Frances A. Lebowitz saw a man from across the room.
“He doesn’t remember this,” Lebowitz says. “I looked, and I see this man smoking a pipe and I said, ‘Who’s this man smoking a pipe?’ And it was Frank. It was you.”
Frank Rich ’71, a former Crimson editorial board chair,  describes his pipe smoking as a “pretentious habit” he picked up as a Harvard undergraduate. At the time, Rich was a New York Times theater critic who struck fear in hearts throughout midtown Manhattan as the “Butcher of Broadway.”
Frequenting Studio 54 and punching the card at Andy Warhol’s The Factory, Lebowitz was the toast of New York following the 1978 publication of her sardonic essay collection “Metropolitan Life.” The two rising stars clicked immediately over politics and culture, and a friendship was born.
“We have a lot of friends in common and a lot of enemies in common,” Rich said.
Thirty years later, they find themselves back at Rich’s alma mater, preparing to begin their two-week swing across the country presenting their diagnosis of modern America. Right now, they are sitting in a room at The Charles Hotel. After our interview, they’ll go to Sanders Theater to exchange insight and punchlines before hundreds of energized liberals.
In their conversations, Rich serves as the sympathetic straight man to Lebowitz, who is a semi-automatic rifle of scathing quips. A chain-smoking lesbian who possesses neither computer nor cell phone nor college degree, Lebowitz’s discourses are so spellbinding that Martin Scorsese recently directed a full-length HBO documentary of her rants.
“Smoking has changed places with homosexuality,” Lebowitz opines. “When I was young, if you had told me the behavior in which I engaged that would be prohibited would be cigarette smoking, I would have had a completely different adolescence. And all the things they say about cigarettes now, they used to say about homosexuality. You shouldn’t do it around children—” Rich jumps in: “You shouldn’t do it on the street—” Lebowitz: “It was the second-hand nature of homosexuality that concerned people.” Rich nods in agreement: “That it would spread.”
Such is the two’s chemistry that they build on each other’s sentences in a high-octane tête-à-tête.
“When people say they hate the elite, I wish they meant rich people,” Lebowitz told us. “But they don’t. They hate smart people. The country adores rich people. I would like to see class warfare, the only kind of warfare the Republicans hate.”
Of the two, the more mainstream Rich describes himself as “slightly more idealistic.” Lebowitz scoffs with some mixture of passion and sarcasm: “I think of myself as burning for idealism and fervor.” She imagines, for example, a country in which no money could be spent on politics until six weeks before the election.“
I would like to be the president, as you may have noticed,” Lebowitz said. “Or the mayor.
”Exactly where her politics lie, though, is harder to pin down.
She’s a libertarian who doesn’t believe in seatbelt or motorcycle helmet laws. “If I want to hurtle through a windshield I’ll hurtle through a windshield,” Lebowitz said.
She’s a leftist who believes that “all the Left has done, in the past 25 years, has made it impossible to smoke a cigarette.”
To this point, Rich starts naming liberal accomplishments in the recent past: women’s rights, fair pay laws, “gay rights, which I know you don’t give a shit about, but still.”
“I’m not against gay rights, obviously—I just don’t think they’re the central issue,” Lebowitz says. “I mean, look at the amount of energy we put into gay marriage. If there were as many gay people in life as there are in television, the debate would be straight marriage.”
One can tell that the two have a banter honed over decades of dinner tables. “Our relationship is—” Rich begins. “Eating,” Lebowitz concludes. “I eat in the same restaurant every single night. [Rich and his family] like to try new restaurants, which I don’t mind, I just don’t want to know what they are.” Rich laughs, “I drink; Fran does not drink. Fran smokes; I don’t smoke.” It’s a perfect fit.
The two intellectuals forged distinctly different paths to the Manhattan corridors of ink in which they reside. Rich graduated magna cum laude from the College, while Lebowitz got her GED after being expelled from high school.
“I spent most of my life reading. If you spend most of your life reading, you don’t have to go to school. School interfered with my reading. I used to get thrown out of class for reading.”
Her parents, however, were never on board with this path of self-education. She recalls talking on the phone with her mother after rising to authorial fame. When she mentioned she was about to go to the airport, her mother asked her where she was going. She replied, “Harvard.” Her mother was incredibly proud—until Lebowitz told her she was going to give a talk there, not to matriculate. “Oh,” her mother replied. “You know, Francie, maybe you could get in now.”
And Rich’s college experience was atypical: “When I went to Harvard, it was shut down half the time because it was the late ’60s. And I went to a public school system that, when I was in it, was declared the worst in the country. There was so much racial tension in American history that we skipped the Civil War; we went from the Louisiana Purchase to the Spanish-American War.”
Cambridge seems like a good starting point for their liberal barnstorming. Their tour will take them to cities such as Las Vegas, Austin, Los Angeles, and—of course—New York. Surely after two weeks crisscrossing the country, the two consummate Manhattanites will be relieved to relax in their natural habitat, though Lebowitz will still have to go outside to have a smoke.

My girlfriend is writing a novel at night. It’s her thesis. It’s more than that, too, but that probably goes without saying. She writes until dawn while I lie near her in a shallow sleep. We argue over whether she should be allowed the glow of a tiny lamp. She turns it off because she knows I like sleeping in total darkness. I turn it back on because I don’t want her eyes to hurt.
She lies with me when I go to sleep. We talk, and sometimes I’m so tired words tumble out of my mouth without making any sense at all. She strokes my hair until my breathing lapses into slow, regular waves, and then she gets up and puts her clothes back on and sits at her desk and writes.
I have a friend, a senior, who’s engaged to a girl he started dating freshman year. They live on opposite sides of campus; he jokingly refers to her as “another extracurricular activity.” Then he laughs and his eyes glint, and so does his ring.
People give me looks and ask if it’s worth it. My own mother–who, by the way, adores my girlfriend–even implied I should be having sex with different people while I’m young and in college. I hear people at school say they don’t have time to be in a relationship, that it’s more important to concentrate on doing well in classes and achieving executive positions in organizations. I listen to all these things with my mouth closed.
It’s true that she eats up my time, and I eat up hers. We switch between each other’s houses, one night in each, which is a pain in the ass when it comes to things like laundry. Sometimes in class I’ll reach for a textbook in my bag and end up pulling out a pair of underwear. And sometimes I wake up crying because I’m so tired.
If I have a cold and my sinuses are blocked and I feel claustrophobic, so does she. If she can’t sleep because she feels sick about the novel sitting in her open computer, neither can I. It’s like that, when you prop each other up. But there are rewards. Like when I whisper something at night, there’s always someone to hear it.
Over summer I had a dream that was set a year from now, after she graduates. The dream was just an image: me, sitting under a window with all my hair cut off, talking to her on one of the red phones that sit uselessly in every Harvard room. The sun was shining brightly through the window, and the dream was neither good nor bad. Or I guess it was both.
When I told her about the dream she took my long hair in her hands and told me I couldn’t cut it. But I liked what I saw; the short hair meant something. It meant that I was in mourning, that I was carrying a certain level of unhappiness around with me, but that I was also a stronger and tougher kind of person. When I think of how I’m going to cope when she leaves, the promise of short hair makes me feel better. But another part of me only cares about looking how she wants, so who knows if I’ll actually do it.
I wake up in the night needing to pee. I can see the warmth of the lamp and her shadow on the wall and can hear the gentle tap tap tap of her fingers at the keys. I slip into the bathroom without her noticing.
When I stumble out, I find her standing up, looking worried.
Was I keeping you up?
No, no.
Without saying anything, she lies back down with me in bed. I think of my classes the next day, and hers, and my midterm, and the deadline for pages of her thesis. I take her hands and press them to my lips and say the only truth there is on nights like these: I love you.

“It’s like a paycheck-to-paycheck sort of process,” says Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15 as she sits in Lowell dining hall, fingering the small elephant charm hanging from her necklace. “I get a ton of grant money from Harvard, but there is still $6,000 to $8,000 left.”
Jinadasa, who grew up in a largely working class community in Long Beach, Calif., receives approximately $50,000 in aid from Harvard each year to cover tuition, room, and board. But this sum leaves out the other expenses associated with attending Harvard—books, travel to-and-from campus—which she and her family have opted to cover with student loans. Jinadasa, who hopes to work for a non-profit advocacy organization or attend law school after graduation, has personally borrowed $14,000 so far; she expects to have incurred between $32,000 and $40,000 in loans by graduation.
She pauses in her explanation, breathing a little deeper: “I guess it is overwhelming, just knowing that I’m going to graduate with debt.”
Jinadasa is among an increasingly large number of young adults who are struggling to keep pace with the rising price of American higher education. Harvard’s cost of attendance is currently $54,496 annually, and it has been increasing at a rate of 3.5-3.8 percent in recent years. The rate of inflation in the U.S., on the other hand, was 2 percent in September of this year according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
If Harvard’s tuition continues increasing at 3.8 percent for the next 20 years, it will cost $114,900 in 2032. If tuition keeps pace with the current rate of inflation, it will be $80,980, roughly two thirds of this amount. Harvard’s peer institutions have been raising tuition at comparable rates to Harvard, though most of them do not come close to providing the financial aid that Harvard does. In fact, Harvard is one of only six colleges in the country that is need-blind and full-need for all applicants (that is, it does not consider financial need in admissions decisions, and meets applicants’ full financial needs). For most Americans, these tuition levels put private postsecondary education beyond reach.
Some—particularly economists—argue that private universities should be even more expensive than they already are.
“If a university is wealthy enough, should it be free?” asks Harvard Kennedy School professor of public policy and management Christopher Avery. “The answer to that is, I don’t think so.” His reasoning: On average, the benefits of a college education will outweigh the costs, and even those graduates with five figures of debt will “catch up very, very quickly.”
“It’s a little bit dangerous to make policy on the basis of what we hope is a long, but temporary, condition of the economy,” agrees Joshua S. Goodman, a Kennedy School assistant professor in public policy.
If anything, Goodman believes Harvard should increase its sticker price to somewhere around $150,000 a year. “Harvard should have really, really high tuition, and it should simultaneously make it as clear as possible to potential applicants that huge amounts of aid are available if their family income warrants it,” he says.
And yet Harvard is not a private for-profit company charging what the market can bear. It is “committed to making educational opportunity accessible to all,” as Harvard stated in the mission published on the admissions website.
Sociology lecturer Patrick Hamm points to this discrepancy, and warns against “subordinating higher education to the principles of the market.”
“Harvard is not a private business. It has its own stated ideals, and it has the knowledge and capability to pursue them,” continues Hamm, referring to the rising costs of a college education.
Despite universities’ public goal of opening the doors to higher education to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, families who cannot afford their expected contributions are still left with two options: turn down an offer of admission, or take out hefty student loans.
According to the Pew Research Center’s September report on student loan debt, nearly one in five U.S. families currently holds outstanding student loans, and the average debt amount is approximately $27,000, up from $11,086 in 1992 and $17,562 in 2001. (These numbers are adjusted for inflation.) Today’s college students are both borrowing more than ever, and struggling as never before to pay off these loans.
Climbing student debt is worrisome. College costs are increasing at twice the rate of families’ incomes; this generation will graduate bearing more financial responsibility at a younger age.
Currently, around one in seven borrowers has defaulted on federal student loans, a symptom of an educational system that is falling further out of step with the job market. Media, educators, and economists alike are beginning to view these default numbers as a crisis waiting to implode. In February of this year, Standard and Poor’s warned, “student-loan debt has ballooned and may turn into a bubble,” adding that “there are more defaults and downgrades for some student loan asset-backed securities.”
Due to the school’s extensive financial aid program, Harvard students stand largely sheltered from the crisis. Those from lower income families may progress through college with more financial consciousness than their peers, their extracurricular choices limited by the need to pay bills, and their initial employment decisions colored by acute financial concerns. But these students will be graduating from an Ivy League university—they will leave Harvard with most opportunities available to them.
Yet there are students, like Jinadasa, who slip through the cracks. Those whose family circumstances fall outside the scope of Harvard’s financial aid program, or whose parents don’t view college expenses as their responsibility to pay. For them, and for students nationwide, the rising cost of a college education is ever more problematic. Tuition increases are far outstripping the rate of inflation, and financial aid programs—even Harvard’s—are insufficient to keep them from graduating with five-figure debt.
These students’ burdens call into question the current college financial structures, as well as Harvard’s responsibility—as an institution with deep pockets and wide influence—to incite change.
STUDENT DEBT AT HARVARD
“It was something that I knew going into college—or, going into Harvard rather—that I would have to do,” says Kelly A. Sullivan ’14, referring to her need to borrow money to pay Harvard tuition. It is one of those startlingly warm October afternoons, and Sullivan is sitting on the Winthrop House patio, doing homework.
Financial considerations played an intimate role in Sullivan’s choice of school. Ultimately, she chose Harvard, which gave her partial aid, over a small liberal arts college that gave her a full ride. After deciding to attend Harvard, Sullivan sat down with her parents and realized, “Okay Kelly, you can either get paid to go to school, or you can go into debt,” she says. Though Harvard’s aid package was generous, her family still couldn’t meet their burden. Her parents have their own debt, which Sullivan understands. “My parents support me, but they don’t think the entire financial burden of my education should be placed on them, whereas Harvard does.”
The reasons vary—insufficient aid packages, decisions to forgo summer employment for travel or unpaid internships, unique familial financial priorities—but roughly 25 percent of the Harvard student body takes out loans. Though the Financial Aid Office does not have final numbers for current classes, slightly more than 400 students from the class of 2012 took out loans during their time at Harvard, says Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue. Their average debt on graduation was $4,400—a sixth of the national average—and Harvard’s default rate is less than 1 percent, as compared to the national rate of 13.4 percent released by the Department of Education in September.
These numbers are down significantly from what they were a few years ago. “If you go back to, say a decade ago, about 1,000 students graduated with a debt that was much higher than what it is now,” Donahue says.
Harvard’s evolving financial aid program can be credited, in large part, for this decrease. Over the past 15 years, Harvard has been actively trying to change its reputation as a paragon of economic elitism. A series of dramatic increases in financial aid, targeted at students coming from the lowest income backgrounds and eventually the middle class, began in 1998. That year, the University announced a $2,000 increase to all financial aid packages, combined with a promise that outside scholarships could first be used to pay off the personal contribution, before being deducted from the school’s scholarship.
This initial move was followed by a series of expansions in financial aid: In 2004, an income ceiling below which families would receive full aid; in 2007, the removal of loans from aid packages, the allowance that families making $180,000 or less annually would only pay 10 percent of their incomes, and the removal of home equity from aid package calculations.
“We expect families to consider paying for their children’s college educations a priority, but we do not expect them to sell their homes or turn their backs on extended family members so they can pay the college bills,” Donahue told The Boston Globe at the time.
Throughout the economic downturn, Harvard has remained committed to maintaining its substantial financial aid. Harvard has instead cut funding for real estate expansion, construction projects, and job creation. At present, only students with family incomes within the top 5 percent are paying full tuition.
“If I were at any other school with less extensive financial aid, I don’t know how I’d still be in school,” says Bethany A. Harris ’13, who has taken out $14,000 in Harvard loans over the course of her four years.
Other institutions have cut their aid programs since 2008, while Harvard has remained steadfast in its commitment to accessibility. Yale lowered its $200,000 family income ceiling on financial aid, and schools like Wesleyan University have gotten rid of need-blind admissions.
“In some ways, the students who come from the families that are the wealthiest, by paying a high tuition, are subsidizing the enrollment and education of the students who are the least wealthy at the same college,” says Avery. “I’m totally for that.”
But despite Harvard’s generous scholarship offerings and loan-free promises, many students still confront the need to take out loans during their undergraduate careers. The University has an online student loan request form, and within a week, a financial aid officer contacts the student to discuss the process and their reasons for borrowing. Most loans Harvard students take out have an interest rate of 5 percent, and don’t accrue interest while the student is in school.
WHERE IS THE WORKING CLASS?
According to data released by the Financial Aid Office in 2009, about 17.8 percent of students come from families whose income falls in the bottom three quintiles of U.S. incomes. Four percent come from the lowest quintile.
This class breakdown is not unique to Harvard; rather, it is representative of top-tier private universities across the country. In an article from March of this year titled “The Reproduction of Privilege,” The New York Times reported that “74 percent of those now attending colleges that are classified as ‘most competitive’...come from families with earnings in the top income quartile, while only three percent come from families in the bottom quartile.”
These statistics reveal that the university is a long way from realizing the noble goal of “[opening the university’s] doors to students of exceptional ability and promise, regardless of their financial circumstances.” Yet Harvard is hardly a university of balanced economic diversity, and the working class has a minimal presence on campus.
While this underrepresentation seems inconsistent with the mission of a university that aims to serve all students regardless of economic background, it is also emblematic of a systemic problem in postsecondary education. According to a 2008 report published by the National Center for Education Statistics, less than 50 percent of working class parents expect their children to attend college. Often, many of these students don’t even apply. As a result, they’re excluded from certain professional career paths; a reproduction of the country’s rising inequality occurs.
As Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, writes in his book “Rewarding Strivers,” “Americans always have preferred education over the welfare state as a means for balancing the equality implicit in citizenship and the inequality implicit in markets.”
In choosing not to pursue higher education, lower income students are closing off many of their pathways to upward mobility.
The student coordinators in the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative try to address the dearth of working class representation on campus, reaching out to prospective students who might not otherwise consider applying. Jordan L.C. Ashwood ’13, who began working there last summer, says she strives to tell high schoolers that “it’s a very warm and accepting culture here at Harvard with regards to financial aid.”
“I have one parent who I was talking to, and she said, ‘You know I saw this email going out about Harvard financial aid and I thought it was a hoax. I thought it wasn’t real and I almost deleted it,’” Ashwood says, emphasizing that it’s a struggle to make those from the lowest income brackets aware of the realities of Harvard financial aid. “I said, ‘Oh no, I’m so glad you didn’t. It’s definitely not a hoax. It’s very much a reality.’ And so I think this process is just very slow-going, unfortunately.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 says that, though imperfect, the financial aid program does an adequate job of combating inequalities on campus. “One of the reasons we put this program together...is that we really did not want to have an upstairs, downstairs situation where some people had full access to the summer programs, for example, study abroad,” he says. “Or they were into extracurricular activities that might not have been possible if we didn’t have that kind of financial aid.”
But some students don’t see it that way. For Jinadasa, the wealth disparity on campus is especially visible this time of year. “I mean, it is punch season,” she says, punctuating her words with a short laugh.
Given Harvard’s extensive financial aid, there is a certain expectation that these wildly disparate economic backgrounds will be somehow invisible while students are at the College. However, lecturer on sociology Timothy Nelson draws attention to the fact that social class has deep personal roots and will not necessarily fade even if Harvard’s financial aid places them on a relatively even playing field during their time on campus.
“You get these kids here, and then how are you supporting them?” Nelson asks. “In some sense, the administration says, well, we’ve done our job by making the student body diverse. So we’ll throw everyone together without thinking about the forms of exclusion that happen once the students reach Harvard.”
“I wish I could say that it feels like a very classless environment, but it’s just not true. You know who has a lot of money and who doesn’t. It’s one of the first things you find out about people,” adds Jinadasa, her fingers once again moving up to touch her necklace. “I think it kind of does change those friendship dynamics, too. I have a few really good friends who are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving, and they’re like, ‘You should come to Puerto Rico with us.’”
“I’m not going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving,” she says.
Harvard can’t eliminate discrepancies in how student wealth is displayed, but Hamm says it has a responsibility to try and lessen the effects. “Harvard is in a position where it can, and in my view should, take steps to mitigate the impact of social class on campus diversity, student admission, and the actual Harvard experience,” he says.
Even for those on the most extensive financial aid, the scholarship does not mean a free ride. “We expect students to work during the academic year, and about $3,000 is the average self-help expectation,” Donahue says. “Most students will choose to have a term-time job and work about 8-10 hours a week to make that up.” Students are also obligated to contribute from their summer earnings, which begin freshman year at about $2,000 and progressively increase.
But 10 hours a week is often only enough to cover what Harvard defines as the student contribution. Left over are personal expenses, the possibility of needing to supplement the parental contribution, or the cost of course books and materials, for which students must decide between working additional hours and taking out loans. On top of that, extracurriculars—from varsity sports that take up tens of hours, to once-a-week mentoring commitments—are also time-consuming.
The result is a campus divided between students whose financial concerns are a daily, pressing issue—with individuals taking out student loans on the extreme—and students whose financial worries are less immediate concerns.
“When they want to go out, I’m working,” says Jinadasa, referring to her friends’ social lives. “My time management has to be colossally better than theirs.”
Harris, whose long blonde hair drapes across the terrier printed on her black T-shirt, says that holding a job while on campus is “a huge time commitment.” She has worked 30 hours a week for the past two semesters in an effort to forgo borrowing more than the $14,000 she has already taken out. This has meant juggling membership in a University Choir and jobs as a ‘Hahvahd’ tour guide and a telemarketer for the Harvard College Fund.
“I often handle it very badly,” Harris says. “If I worked a whole shift and gave a tour that day, when I get home my first thought isn’t, ‘Oh I have to do my reading for Hist & Lit.’ It’s, ‘Interesting, I see they have all the episodes of “Arrested Development” on Netflix.’”
“I also don’t eat lunch almost every day and frequently skip dinner,” Harris adds. “I’ve become a massively good multitasker.”
Still, Harris hasn’t been able to participate in many of the activities that other students find so foundational to their college experiences, such as taking a leadership role in a student organization. This lost opportunity is her “one real regret about Harvard.”
“I’m in shows but I could never produce a show or stage manage a show, which is something that would involve a large amount of time,” Harris says. “I’m not on the board of any organization. I’ve never run for office in anything. I’m not in any other clubs because I just don’t see how I would do it.”
Sarah, another senior who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because her parents do not know about the extent of her student debt, is sitting in Starbucks, her oversized Harvard sweatshirt sloping over her shoulders. Sarah is not from a well-off family. In fact, her parental contribution is zero, and Sarah thinks Harvard generally does a good job with families like hers. “I don’t think there’s a huge need on campus for students on full financial aid to take out loans,” she says. She is one of the lucky ones.
Yet Sarah didn’t get enough funding to do research this summer. In order to be eligible for a loan—and therefore able to pay rent while doing research—Sarah ended up enrolling in a Harvard Summer School course, which she had to borrow extra money to cover. In the end she was left with about $9,000 in debt.
Before this past summer, Sarah had already taken out $6,000 to participate in a program in Spain, and another chunk to purchase a computer. Recently, Sarah also took out a small loan to pay for a semester’s worth of student contribution, which she found herself unable to provide through term-time employment.
“I used to work dorm crew, but I gave that up because I wanted a job where I could do homework,” Sarah says. Now, she works in a library.
Sarah is also pre-med, and had 27 hours of class each week last semester. She feels lucky that the lab where she does research is able to employ her. It’s only possible, though, because Sarah qualifies for work-study, a federal program that helps pay student wages. And Sarah doesn’t mind working. “Where I come from, everyone works while they’re going to college, so I didn’t think it would be such a huge burden on my time here,” she says.
Yet it has been. Sarah rowed crew freshman year, but that was a large time commitment. Now, she has a leadership role in one student organization. “There are definitely things I would’ve gotten more involved in,” she says.
Fortunately for Sarah, her loans won’t start accruing interest until after she leaves school. Since she is applying to medical schools and planning to work as a family doctor in a rural area, that may be years. “Right now, that seems like a lot of money, but I’m hoping after medical school....” Sarah cuts herself off. “Let’s be honest, I’m going to take out even more loans.”
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE ON CAMPUS
Though 25 percent of the student body takes out loans, and even more work multiple jobs to cover expenses, financial burdens are notably absent from the discourse on campus. Students simply don’t inquire about their peers’ economic circumstances and are often reluctant to mention their own financial status.
“I think it’s just sort of assumed that Harvard does such a good job with financial aid that it isn’t an issue,” Sarah says.
Ricardo Medina ’13 had estimated that only 5 percent of students take out loans because he had read that only about 5 percent qualify for the federal Pell grant. He had thought, “If their parents make more than $60,000, then you wouldn’t need to take a loan.”
“I get the sense that—among students—talking about one’s class background as anything other than ‘middle class’ is taboo,” writes  Caroline Light, Director of Undergraduate Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, in an email. “This impulse to downplay one’s class status is intensified at Harvard, an institution of high cultural capital and prestige with many students who hail from privileged backgrounds.”
Jinadasa says this is particularly pronounced amongst people on the extremes of the wealth scale. “I think especially people who are wealthy are very, very afraid to discuss money, because they’re not sure who they’re offending,” Jinadasa says. “It’s part of respectability politics, that dialogue: We don’t talk about money; we don’t talk about religion; we don’t talk about politics.”
Medina agrees that students avoid discussing finances, saying that he only really mentions his student loans to his blockmates, and even then, rarely. “I think it’s not just at Harvard. When you’re with friends, you’re not talking about super serious personal issues all the time,” he says. “I think people see it as tacky.”
But silence on the financial front does not mean that students are blind to the circumstances of their peers. Choices of dress, computers, vacations, and eating out are unspoken markers of socioeconomic status, and inevitably lead to comparisons. “One of my frustrations, I felt last spring was that some of my friends were going to Harvard completely free, and when they worked, all that money was going to them, to pay for stuff, to save for stuff,” Sullivan says. “And then I was taking out all these personal loans, and achieving all this personal debt, and all the money I was making went straight to my termbill instead of dinners out with friends. That was a little frustrating for me.”
Hamm, who is teaching a course this semester titled “Inequality, Poverty, and Wealth in Comparative Perspective,” says that discussing these issues exposes vulnerabilities.  “One problem people have when they discuss class and privilege is a certain self-consciousness and insecurity,” Hamm says.
“Particularly less-wealthy students might feel that, in order to fit in, they have to downplay aspects of their lives that would reveal their family’s class background, like withholding information or being vague about where they grew up, or where/whether their family takes regular vacations, their work obligations outside of class,” Light writes.
Though Medina agrees that the situation at Harvard is far better than at many other places—his friends back home in California take out upwards of $50,000 to pay for college—his four-digit debt is not insignificant. He borrowed to help pay for personal expenses during a summer spent in Argentina through Harvard, and to alleviate the burden of his student contribution during the academic year. “It’s a lot better here,” Medina says, comparing himself to students at other colleges. Still, Medina finds the promotional material a bit misleading. “Harvard needs to do a better job telling people, ‘No, your education probably won’t be loan-free.’” Nor should it be, some argue. “It’s not obviously a problem that people graduate college with debt,” Goodman says. “The question is how much is a reasonable amount?”
MOVING FORWARD: ONLINE EDUCATION
According to a Gallup survey conducted for Inside Higher Ed, 50 percent of college admissions officers believe it is reasonable for students to graduate from a private four year college with $20,000 - $30,000 in debt.
College is an investment, and like in any investment, risk is an inherent component. Economics professor Claudia Goldin compares paying for a college education to purchasing one’s first home. “No one expects someone to purchase a home from their savings. No one expects them to purchase a home from their income,” Goldin says. “We expect them to take loans out to do that, and they should be long-term.”
Yet with the price of a college education increasing at more than twice the rate of inflation, these debt burdens will soon be far too hefty for families to manage, though for many they are already. Universities, too—especially those with smaller endowments—will struggle to maintain comprehensive financial aid programs.
The question then becomes: Whose responsibility is it to address these rising costs? Should universities be covering costs from sources other than student tuition, like wealthy donors or taxpayers, or should they be drastically reducing expenses from within?
The answer seems to be that both of these solutions are, for the most part, untenable. Universities are expensive because they are, as Goldin says, “collections of very smart people.” She explains that, even though colleges are technologically stagnant, professors’ “earnings have to go up at the same rate of high skilled people in other sectors.”
It is, and will always be, incredibly costly to keep brilliant individuals in academia when they could be making large sums working in other industries.
Government professor Paul E. Peterson suggests that the government is equally powerless to address the rising cost of higher education in an effective manner. “It’s not a matter of what the government does. It’s not a matter of how much the government is going to spend on education,” he says. “This is much a deeper, broader problem than that.”
“The only way education is going to be affordable in the long run is to going to be through digital learning techniques, which are less labor intensive,” Peterson says.
“We are, I believe, on the cusp of enormous technological change in universities. We have been creating courses for which you do not have to be in a classroom, and there are courses for which there are huge economies of scale,” Goldin agrees. “It’s going to be change that’s not just shifting to online education. It’s going to be a mixture of residential living and online education for some, and for those who want it on the cheap, no residential living. That will be moving universities into the dynamic sector.”
We are already seeing this shift toward online education; colleges, both community and top-tier, are developing online course materials that are accessible to a wider audience of students at a lower cost.
With this fall’s launch of edX, Harvard and MIT’s online education platform, Harvard is beginning to move into this space. As of its release, HarvardX has more than 100,000 registered students, all of whom are taking its courses free of charge.
And this shift will by no means be instantaneous. Both the technological developments and the institutional change from within universities will take time. Progress will be gradual.
Online education certainly will not solve all of the issues of the rising costs of higher education. But as colleges begin to adopt a less labor-intensive educational model, so too they will begin to address a crisis that has been a long time coming, a crisis that increasing financial aid or federal loans has been unable to solve. And Harvard will have to be at the center of this change.
As Katherine K. Merseth, Director of Teacher Education Programs at the Graduate School of Education, says, “The institution is one that people pay attention to, and when Harvard talks, people listen.”

It’s Friday night. You want to see your crush, but what do those winky faces and unanswered texts mean? Inspired by HeTexted, FM’s got your back... ;)
Dilem #1
You text girl: “heyyyy. what are u up to?” 45 minutes, no response.
What this could mean: She’s not into you, she’s watching “Clueless” with her friends, or both.
Do: If she does respond, prove you have an even more active social life by holding out one minute longer than she made you wait.
Don’t: Use the overindulgent “trailing letter.” Every extra “y” you add to the word “hey” makes you sound that much more desperate. Don’t butt text her “accidentally” or resend the same text in case she didn’t get it the first time. She did.
Dilem #2
Two hours before a date at Russell House, she texted: “hey, so we’re going to a Club, right?”
What this could mean: She’s a Harvard Hoochie, she thinks you’re in the Spee, or you’re her wingman for the night.
Do: Text her back. “Well, they call my room the Delphic for a reason.” Winky face optional. It’s a high-risk, high-reward move.
Don’t: Take her to the Delphic.
Dilem #3
You text guy: “boreddd”, “just chilling”, “Wish I had some Noch’s right now” Response: “cool”
What this could mean: He is passive-aggressive, he is not into you, or he is a boy who doesn’t get social cues.
Do: Two can play this game. Go for the ultimate in passive-agressive: “k.” Or text a hot guy friend and mupload a picture of you two getting pizza.
Don’t: Grovel, be generally pathetic.
Dilem #4
He texted: Five Emoji hearts You: Simultaneously thrilled and horrified
What this could mean: He’s in love with you, he’s drunk, or he’s been hacked.
Do: Use a standard “haha” (not: “hahahah”) to gauge his love/sobriety/possession of his own phone.
Don’t: Pour your heart out over text. Emojis should make anyone suspicious.

Leah Garrett, a professor of Jewish literature from Monash University, addressed a packed room of graduate students and Jewish literature enthusiasts Wednesday about Jewish-American war novels. Sponsored by the Jewish Cultures and Societies Seminar and the Center for Jewish Studies, the talk focused on five best-selling novels from 1948, including Norman Mailer’s The Naked and the Dead and Irwin Shaw’s The Young Lions.
Garrett, whose grandfather and great uncles were Jewish American soldiers, had both personal and academic motivations when she started her research. After she took a professorship in Australia in 2008, she explained that she became more interested in what it meant to be an American than when she was living in the States. The thesis of her talk—and of her upcoming book—is that Jewish American writers possess a unique perspective on World War II.
“I discovered quite remarkably that virtually all of the best-selling novels about World War II in America, except for James Jones, were by Jews and were about Jewish soldiers,” she said. “There’s this huge story that has never been told because everyone focuses on the Holocaust.”
Garrett moved away from the canonical works of Philip Roth and Saul Bellow and instead focused on literature that was part of popular culture, which consequently had a direct impact on how postwar Americans understood the war effort. She explained that these authors were trying to emphasize the endemic anti-Semitism and racism in WWII and hoped to teach Americans that pluralism was the ideal.
Garrett shared anecdotes gleaned from archival research about how author Norman Mailer allegedly only went to war so that he could write the “Great American War Novel,” and how he encouraged the recipients of his letters to save his musings for future writings.
Eric M. Nelson ’99, Director of the Center for Jewish Studies, praised both the nature of the lecture and Garrett’s understanding of an understudied period in Jewish American literature.
Samuel E. Milner ’13, who is writing his thesis about World War II on the home front, was attracted to this lecture because he has read later period Jewish American wartime novels but was curious about this genre with respect to the 40s.
“In the later period, novels would ask: What is a rabbi doing in the middle of the army base? How does that work? But this period is back to basics—how does a Jew become an American?” he said.

In a panel convened to discuss the parallels between Evangelical Christians and Latter Day Saints, Mark R. Silk ’72, a professor of religion at Trinity College, aimed to tell the “hidden story of religion in the election and in the Republican Party.”
Voter demographics from the past twenty years have shown that voters who strongly claim a religious identity usually align themselves with the Republican Party. This trend, known as the “god gap,” is most obvious among Evangelicals and Mormons, Silk said. In fact, over 75% of Mormons voted for the Republican nominee for the past 12 elections.
Both the Mormons and Evangelicals focus their rhetoric around a return to past ideals, according to Silk. “The idea of going back to the golden days is as old as civilization,” he said.
After a period of conservatism in the early twentieth century, these communities became less vocal in their cultural criticisms and moved towards an acceptance of mainstream society, according to Silk. However, as they watched the progressive movements of the 1960s, many began to believe that a return to conservatism with a focus on family values would better suit the country.
“What activated the religious gene was to recover what was lost in the 1960s,” Silk said.
As the two religions began to ignite social change through politics, an idea of American exceptionalism emerged in an attempt to restore a country that served as an example to other nations. This theory was reinforced by Ronald Reagan who adopted the biblical phrase “a city on a hill.”
Presidential candidate Mitt Romney reinforces the idea of exceptionalism today, as well as the idea of restoration, Silk said. Romney’s Super PAC is named “Restore our Future.”
“Mormons are not going back to Brigham Young’s Zionism, but there is a pull in that direction,” he said.
Despite similarities between these two groups, Silk said that each is generally not cognizant of the actions of the other group. “It is clear that they are unaware of each other’s thoughts. They are both in the conservative ﬁght, but they don’t work together,” he said.
“Without the publicity of Mitt Romney, Mormons, who are only two percent of the US population, would not even be featured in this discussion,” said history professor Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in a critical examination following the lecture.
She also pointed out that Romney’s campaign has been much more focused on economics than religion. “Many Mormons are not happy that this is the world’s most famous Mormon,” Ulrich said.
Overall, the crowd engaged with the panel, asking questions and participating in the discussion.
“This is deﬁnitely a pertinent issue in the midst of the upcoming election, one that deserves this kind of intense discussion,” Emma R. Adler ’16 said.

University President Drew G. Faust addressed questions on mental health in a wide ranging conversation with students at Kirkland House Wednesday evening.“Students come to the University sometimes having had mental health issues that we want to be able to address,” Faust said. “This is a very stressful place, and we want to make sure that those issues are supported."
Faust described mental health as a concern that is “very much on [the] minds” of University administrators at the moment.
Trevor N. Coyle ’14, who asked Faust two mental health questions during the event, said Harvard faces two particular student mental health problems: students avoid seeking help because of stigma associated with counseling, and Harvard University Health Services faces a backlog of students who request help.
"There should be no stigma about reaching out for health,” Faust said in response to Coyle’s question.
Though Faust said she was unaware of the backlog issue at HUHS, she said Professor Paul J. Barreira—the newly-named director of HUHS—is especially passionate about addressing the mental health needs of students. Barreira previously served as the director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling at HUHS, a position that oversees, among other things, Harvard’s Student Mental Health Services.
After the event, student attendees said that mental health issues have been a topic of frequent discussion on Harvard’s campus, especially in the wake of recent suicides.
“I think the amount of interest and the questions that were raised show how much students care and that there need to be more spaces to address those question on campus,” Roland Yang ’14, one of the event’s two moderators, said of mental health issues.
While mental health was the most prominent topic during the conversation, student questions ranged from the paucity of female professors at Harvard to Faust’s commitment to the creation of a campus center in the Holyoke Center.
The conversation took a light-hearted turn at the end, when Yang took a moment to ask Faust to name her ideal Kirkland House Secret Santa gift, a task or an object that Kirkland residents receive from one another. “My dream—no more outdoor Harvard celebrations in the rain,” Faust said.

Finding life on another planet may not be as far-fetched as it once seemed.
In a lecture hosted Wednesday by the Origins of Life Initiative, an interdisciplinary center focused on the development of life on Earth and the possibility of life on other planets, MIT professor Sara Seager listed conditions necessary for an extraterrestrial habitable planet and noted the speed at which other such planets are being discovered.
“It’s a field that has been exploding lately,” said Emma J.K. Kowal ’15, who attended the lecture. “If you’re interested in science in general, it takes aspects from chemistry, geology, astrophysics...and also aliens. Who doesn’t like aliens?”
In her talk, Seager noted the sheer diversity of exoplanets, or planets that exist outside the Solar System. In particular, she discussed the habitable zone, the region around a star in which planets could conceivably maintain liquid water supplies.
“You can have an atmosphere that’s very different from earth but still has surface liquid water,” she said.
The main goal of current exoplanet research, Seager said, is to lay the groundwork for future scientists. “Our goal is to figure out what is out there so that hundreds or thousands of years from now, when we do figure out how to get there, they will look back on us, not individually but collectively, as the people who started the process,” she said.
The study of exoplanets is relatively new—groundbreaking discoveries are made on a regular basis. On Tuesday, a team from Switzerland identified Alpha Centauri Bb, an Earth-sized planet located just outside our solar system.
Zachory K. Berta, a research assistant in astronomy, is currently working on a project involving the study of exoplanet atmospheres. “In my experience, it’s always been very accessible [to understand the significance of the discovery of an exoplanet], in the sense that people get planets,” he said. “We’re not talking about black holes, general relativity, or the expansion of the universe—we’re talking about things like the Earth, and the idea that you could have another planet like the Earth has already been explored in science fiction.”
And research in this area is just getting started. “We are at this really remarkable place in human history where we just now have the technology and the techniques to start to objectively address questions about the universe,” Berta said.

Following the completion in August of a plan more than three years in the making to reorganize Harvard’s library system, some faculty say that the future of the library’s collection remains unclear—a concern borne out by staff changes in recent years.
“From the perspective of collecting, there’s been a years long decline in support,” said Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas, who dates the slow-down in acquisitions to the early 1990s. Recent turnover in collections staff is especially troubling, Thomas added. “A decline in the number and expertise of our bibliographers directly impacts the excellence of our collecting,” he said.
Since the process of streamlining and centralizing Harvard’s 73 libraries began in the spring of 2009, several positions in collections have become vacant, and other key posts remain unfilled. According to the Harvard College Library’s internal directories, Harvard currently has two active collectors responsible for English language acquisitions, down from three in academic year 2008-2009. Additionally, Harvard currently employs one bibliographic specialist for books in French, Italian, German, Dutch, and major Scandinavian languages—a job that has been filled by up to three separate collectors in the past.
Faculty also expressed concerns over the difficulties associated with integrating more digital media into the library system. Post-reorganization statistics suggest a shift in focus to online materials. While the number of hard copy titles in the library system grew by 2% between fiscal year 2009 and 2010, the number of “e-resources” grew by 64%, according to a 2010 report published by the library system.
With an ever expanding pool of print and online publications, professor of Hebrew and other oriental languages Peter Machinist ’66 said that new acquisitions should still be selected from a scholarly perspective. “Before that kind of decision is made, a faculty member in the know needs to be consulted,” he said.
“So far the librarians have been very responsive,” Machinist said, adding that he is primarily worried about how the administrative changes of the reorganization will affect collections in coming years. “I’m also concerned because I know a lot of library staff—I’ve gotten a sense that many of them are concerned if they have a future.”
The execution of the library reorganization raised red flags for Thomas as well, who expressed concern about a move towards corporate-style decision making in the library environment. “In a world of diminishing portfolio returns, it’s a matter of common sense that something has got to give,” said Thomas.
Still, faculty said they recognize that many changes associated with the library reorganization are necessary. “I think the current FAS and University administration are, in principle, in support of correcting the problems around collecting,’ said Thomas.
The library system is currently seeking 3 high-level bibliographers, according to job-listings on Harvard’s internal network that were shown to The Crimson by a University employee last week. These listings included an English language position and an additional specialist for Western European collections.
In spite of such steps, both Thomas and Machinist said they harbor concerns about the future primacy of Harvard’s libraries.
“We used to compare ourselves with the British Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale, and the Library of Congress,” Thomas said. “Now we say, ‘Hey, we’re up there with Yale.’”

CLARIFICATION: Oct. 18
An earlier version of this article stated that Harvard reorganized its library system three years ago. While the reorganization was announced three years ago, it went into effect this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part II in a series on the presidential election's impact on the issues that Harvard lobbies on. Read Part I on student financial aid and Part III on immigration.
At Harvard, where Congressional appropriations can mean the difference between continuing years’ worth of research and putting a project on ice, the two presidential candidates’ plans for closing the federal deficit could have tremendous consequences.
Harvard received more than $600 million in federal funding for research in fiscal year 2010, according to the University’s annual fiscal report released in 2011.
That funding may be at risk, depending on whether Democrat Barack Obama or Republican Mitt Romney—who hold disparate views on public funding—wins this November’s presidential election.
Another cut to research money, which has already been diminished by belt-tightening in the wake of the financial crisis, could seriously hamper projects, faculty members said.
“Funding is already short and I am reducing the size of my team and the questions we try to address,” Harvard researcher David T. Scadden wrote in an email.
A reduction in federal funding would have implications for universities across the nation and could even “threaten the preeminence of the US in biomedical research and innovation as it depends on a pipeline of talented people with bold ideas,” Scadden wrote.
RESEARCHING THE PLATFORMS
While both candidates have repeatedly emphasized their support for scientific research, their platforms reveal differences in their plans for providing that aid.
In previous statements, Obama has said that he wants to double scientific research funding. In his 2012 budget proposal, he increased funds for the National Institutes of Health by three percent, to $32 billion for basic and applied biomedical research.
Romney’s platform calls for budget cuts to research funding and to agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities, stating that research should be privatized instead.
Scientific American asked the two candidates a series of questions regarding their positions on research and innovation in America. In the interview, Obama reaffirmed his promise to increase government spending on research: “I strongly support investments in research and development that help spur America innovation and proposed a goal that, as a country, we invest more than 3 percent of our GDP in public and private research and development.”
Romney repeated his pro-private industry stance: “Good public policy must also ensure that federal research is being amplified in the private sector, and that major breakthroughs are able to make the leap from the laboratory to the marketplace.”
CUTS ON THE HORIZON
Before the next presidential inauguration, a series of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts—known as sequestration—are set to slash research funding by 8.2 percent beginning on Jan. 2, 2013.
The choice of a president, as well as the outcome of the Congressional elections, could set the tone for how Congress addresses the looming sequestration during the waning days of its session, said Suzanne Day, Harvard’s director of federal relations.
The next commander-in-chief could ask Congress to balance its budget by means other than sequestration, avoiding the automatic cuts. The Obama White House has said that it does not support sequestration, and Romney has spoken out against it as well.
But if Congress cannot avoid the sequester, Harvard will face an immediate reduction in research funding for the current fiscal year, according to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s chief lobbyist and vice president for public affairs and communications.
This summer, University President Drew G. Faust co-signed a letter along with more than 100 fellow university presidents addressed to President Obama and Congress. Their missive urged the legislators to overcome partisan differences so that they could prevent the cuts that sequestration would bring.
“Sequestration is an undiscerning and blunt budget tool that would substantially harm our nation’s future by blindly slashing valuable investments in education and scientific research,” the letter read, ending by stating, “As national leaders in higher education, we urge you to show America and the world that our country’s political system is capable of solving serious problems.”
Harvard is now working with other leading research universities, including Stanford, Michigan, and the University of Texas, as well as industries that benefit from academic research, to make a collective argument on behalf of the university-government research partnership
The University has not shied away from urging political action to preserve science funding before—notably, then-University President Neil L. Rudenstine said in his 1995 Commencement address that Harvard’s research was “seriously at risk” and urged those assembled to vote against candidates who would propose cuts to research.
THE CASE FOR FUNDS
Harvard academics have utilized federal money since the early years of the Cold War, when the American government, eager to remain competitive with other nations, began distributing funding to research universities.
During those years, Harvard attributed much of its own growth to funding from the federal government. Today, a significant portion of Harvard’s federal funding flows through the National Institutes of Health, a government-funded entity that doles out cash for science research.
If Congress does not act, sequestration will require an immediate 8.2 percent reduction in the agency's budget, and Casey said "that becomes almost impossible to manage for the National Institutes of Health."
Scadden believes that government agencies should support university research because scholars’ vital studies may not be attractive to private companies.
“Basic research is critically dependent on the federal government as it is too far from  a product that can be sold to be of interest to companies,” he said. Yet such experiments, he said, can form “the basis for innovations that have had enormous impact on the well-being of society.”
Casey agreed that academic research can lead to significant contributions to society, even monetary ones, in the long run.
“There are so many competing, well-deserving programs in the federal budget, but not all of them are ones that pay back in the way that we believe research and education do over time,” Casey said. “The longer view would say that the young men and women who are getting educated are going to be paying more in taxes over time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 2 p.m. on a weekday afternoon, and while most Harvard students are finishing afternoon classes for the day, the Harvard Polo Club loads up in a van and makes the hour-long trek to Ipswich, Mass., for an afternoon of intense training and horsemanship.
“[I love] getting that time away from campus,” said junior men’s polo captain Shawn DeMartino.
Well outside the Boston city limits, the team trains under the close eye of coach and Harvard alum Crocker Snow ’61, who has witnessed firsthand the reestablishment of the polo program at his alma mater over the past six years.
The resurgence of Harvard polo can largely be attributed to the efforts of Snow and his family, who have helped spearhead efforts to reinvigorate the once obsolete program.  The Snow family has deep ties to the sport, as Snow himself was an accomplished amateur player.  His wife Cissie was once considered one of the top American professional players, and three of his five sons play professionally.
“[Crocker] is probably one of the most interesting guys I know,” DeMartino said.
Now at the helm of the program alongside his wife, Snow works to bring his knowledge and love of polo to the Crimson students who take to the game each year.
REKINDLING AN OLD FLAME
According to Snow, the Harvard Polo Club—initially founded in 1882—is the oldest intercollegiate polo club in the country.  But the club has drifted in and out of existence since its inception.
“It’s been up and down for a long, long time,” Snow said.  “There were a lot of times when there was really no team at all.”
As a student at the College, Snow was a member of the varsity men’s hockey team.  At the time, there was no official polo club at Harvard.  But as an experienced rider, Snow cultivated his interest in the sport during his undergraduate years.
Though the Harvard team was never officially established, Snow and three or four of his friends travelled to other schools with instituted programs to play away games, often on borrowed horses.
After graduation, Snow travelled all over the world as a foreign correspondent, but amidst his busy travel schedule, he continued to play recreational polo overseas, developing into an accomplished amateur player.
LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON
Despite the enthusiasm of Snow and his peers over four decades ago, the Harvard polo program was never revived until much more recently in 2006.
At the time, Snow’s fourth son, Nick Snow ’09, was a student at Harvard and, following in the footsteps of his father, a member of the varsity hockey squad.  But during his sophomore year, the younger Snow decided to quit the team.  Having taken up the sport in his early teenage years, the sophomore was an accomplished polo player, and he began investigating the possibility of resurrecting the Harvard Polo Club once again.
“He started talking to a couple people in the College,” said Snow of his son’s efforts.  “He got a couple of people together to go take a whack at it.”
The younger Snow and company travelled that year to play at Yale. But without horses of their own, the team once again borrowed horses from their host for the first match played by the newly resurrected Harvard team.
Around the same time, the elder Snow married his wife Cissie, herself an extremely decorated professional polo player.  Nick Snow asked his father if the couple would consider coaching the newly established team, and the pair quickly agreed.
“We really didn’t know what we were coaching,” the elder Snow said of his entrée into coaching.  “All of the other kids had never played polo before.  We got involved quite quickly to help out.”
JONES TO THE RESCUE
But even with the experienced couple at its helm, the program still lacked the financial resources to expand.  Most importantly, the team needed horses with which to train.
Enter actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69. Coach Snow met Jones through a chance encounter in Florida, where the coach was watching one of his older sons compete in a professional polo match.  Jones had heard of Nick Snow’s efforts to revive the defunct polo team at his alma mater, and as a long-time polo enthusiast, Jones approached the elder Snow expressing his interest in supporting the burgeoning program.
“He knew about [Nick],” Snow said.  “[Jones] said ‘I’ve always been waiting for this, and I’m very happy to start helping out and giving you some support.’”
Nick Snow’s interest and Jones’s support created what Crocker Snow would call the “perfect storm” for the revival of the Harvard polo program.
The following year, the club recruited several new members; Jones and a few other private donors contributed several horses; and the polo club had once again established its presence at Harvard.
GROWING THE PROGRAM
Since its rebirth in 2006, the team continues to grow.
“Each year we get more players, a bigger schedule,” Snow said.  “I would say [we are] completely well-established as a team now.”
Every fall, the team sets up a booth at the Fall Activities Fair in an effort to recruit new students to the program.  Some players with past equestrian experience, like DeMartino, join the team as a way to continue riding in college, while others sign up having never been on a horse.
None of the players come in with any competitive polo experience.
“We’ve probably had a total of fifty or so players over the past five or six years,” Snow said.  “Not one of them, other than my son, [had] ever held a polo mallet before.”
The growth and development of the players over the course of their time at Harvard is a highlight of Snow’s coaching experience.
“It’s been quite remarkable how excited the undergraduates have gotten with the game,” Snows said. “Some of them, over three or four years, get really good.”
The current team boasts a competitive schedule, having recently competed against the likes of Yale, UConn, Virginia, and Stanford, among others.  Many of these schools recruit players with competitive polo backgrounds, but Snow maintains that Harvard can still compete with even the best of its veteran opponents.
“We do very well against most teams in the country,” Snow said.
But despite generous alumni and donor support, Harvard still lags behind its peers in terms of program resources.  Currently, the Crimson has roughly 15 horses with which to practice and play.  According to Snow, Virginia, a perennial polo powerhouse, boasts over 60.  Cornell, the top Ivy League program, has well over 40.
The next step in the development of the program, in Snow’s eyes, is the establishment of a permanent home for Harvard polo.
Currently, the team hosts its home games at the Myopia Club in Hamilton, Mass., but Snow says the team would ideally have a permanent stable with which to house its horses near the Myopia facility.  Fundraising and donor support efforts are well underway.
“We are quite close to [buying] a small farm where we could keep all of our horses and practice,” Snow said.
Another vision for the future of the club is the establishment of a therapeutic riding program.  Harvard would be one of the first collegiate institutions in the country initiating such an endeavor, which would be open to graduates, faculty, employees, and families.
“It’s another way for the kids to get involved in a positive way, [while working] with the horses,” Snow said.
A DELICATE BALANCE
But while efforts to grow the program remain in the works, the team remains fully focused on its current endeavors.
This week, four members of the Harvard polo team will travel to Scottsdale, Ariz., to participate in the second annual Scottsdale Polo Championships.  At the event, Harvard will compete in an exhibition match against Work to Ride, a competitive polo team comprised of students from inner-city Philadelphia.
Established in 1994, Work to Ride is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving underprivileged youth.  In 2011, Work to Ride became the first all-black team to capture the U.S. Polo Association’s National Interscholastic Championship.
Noticeably absent from the Crimson contingent at the event will be Snow himself.  Currently, Snow must balance his time between his coaching duties for the Crimson and his work as the director of the Edward R. Murrow Center for Public Diplomacy at Tuft University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  During the Scottsdale event, Snow will be overseas giving a series of talks in Armenia.
Though it can be difficult balancing polo amongst his other commitments, his students’ enthusiasm and drive keep Snow motivated and excited about the future of Harvard polo.
And despite coming in with no polo experience, most players consider their time on the polo team to be a highlight of their undergraduate years.
“Mostly everybody on the team would say that [polo] is by far the most enriching experience they’ve had on campus,” DeMartino said.
“That’s why I do it,” Snow said.  “To me, it was always [about] the satisfaction of all the different kids that get involved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After defeating Brown, 4-1,  in Providence, the Harvard women’s soccer team (7-3-3, 2-1-1 Ivy) will look to pick up its fourth victory in five games against Princeton (9-3-1, 4-0-0) in Princeton, N.J. on Saturday. The Crimson has not lost for nearly a month since the team dropped their conference opener against Penn on Sept. 21.
“I think that we really came together as a team against Brown,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said. “I think the score doesn’t really show how much that game meant to us as a team for our confidence. It was important that we played really well together and played the style that we want to play.”
Although the Tigers are currently leading the Ivy League with twelve points—five more than Harvard—the Crimson is the league’s defending champion and defeated Princeton, 2-1, at home last season.
In 2010, the last time that Harvard visited Princeton, they came away with a 4-0 victory.
Against Holy Cross on Tuesday night, the Crimson scored four goals in the second half for the second straight game.
After a scoreless first half in which the teams managed a combined two shots on goal, Harvard scored five minutes into the second half on a strike from sophomore Mai Le and added a quick insurance goal on a header by sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby.
Junior co-captain Peyton Johnson said the game provided good preparation for Saturday’s game against the Tigers.
“Having a midweek game is a great opportunity because it’s the best practice you can have for a big game like Princeton,” Johnson said. “I think we played really well. After a slow start in the first half, I think that we found a rhythm in the second half and played up to our potential.”
In their last three games, Harvard has limited its opponents to a combined five shots on goal in the second half—outscoring them, 8-2, over that time. Against the Bears, Johnson said that the Crimson submitted its most complete performance of the year.
“I think that the win against Brown was a huge step for us,” Johnson said. “At moments we have shown the kind of play that we can put together and the kind of team that we can be, and [last Saturday] we put together the kind of performance that helped prove who we are.”
With three goals and two assists in the last two Ancient Eight games, Casscells-Hamby has played a role in all five Crimson goals over that span. Harvard had a combined 20 shots on goal in the last two games compared to only three for its opponents. Kanten said the Brown game provided a model for how the team needs to play heading into their weekend tilt against Princeton.
“A big takeaway [from Brown] is that we can look at the game and see we can score a lot of goals and play together,” Kanten said. “This weekend is a big game for us and [Brown showed] that we are just as good as any other team—we can score, we can defend, and we can play with anybody. It’s definitely going to be a battle and you have to be 100 percent there emotionally and put everything into the game.”
In their last two games, six different Crimson players have had assists, and the team has had eight different players put a shot on goal. The team has scored as many goals in the last two games as it did in the previous seven. With the exception of an 8-1 loss against Boston College, Kanten and the defense have not allowed more than a single goal per game in nearly six weeks.
According to Johnson, during the game against Brown the team was able to maintain possession of the ball for fifteen or twenty passes at a time. Johnson continued by saying that if Harvard is able to come out this upcoming Saturday with the same level of intensity as it did in Providence, the team should have a good chance to come out victorious.
“I think that if we can put together a performance that is up to our potential, I think we can compete with any team in the league,” Johnson said. “If we can come out against Princeton with confidence and maintain the composure that we found against Brown that will put us in a really good position to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Temperatures in Boston were in the low 60s on Oct. 16, 1965, when more than 250 oarsmen in nearly 100 boats gathered at Boston University’s DeWolfe Boathouse on the Charles River.
Coached by 29-year-old Harry Parker, crews from Harvard were set to compete against boats from MIT, Penn, Northeastern, and Dartmouth as well as the Vesper and Potomac Boat Clubs in the first-ever Head of the Charles Regatta.
At 1:30, the event was underway amidst a light rain, and would be over within three-and-a-half hours.
“Nobody quite knew what to expect,” recalls Parker, who had represented the United States in the single sculls at the Rome Summer Olympics five years prior. “There weren’t a lot of participants.”
That was something that would change very quickly.
Fast-forward 48 years, and Parker, now just over a week away from his 77th birthday, is still heading the Crimson men’s crew program.
But other than that constant, one would find few similarities between today’s event and that of nearly a half-century ago.
The Head of the Charles is now the largest two-day regatta in the world. One weekend every October, nearly 9,000 athletes from all around the globe race more than 1,900 boats in 55 events as approximately 300,000 people look on.
“It’s a great kind of reunion for all kinds of competitors, from various high school programs to college programs to club programs,” says Elizabeth Diamond, Director of Operations for the Regatta. “[That’s what] brings everyone back every year.”
IN THE BEGINNING
In 1964, Harvard sculling instructor Ernest Arlett proposed an idea for a “head of the river” race. Such time-trial competitions were traditional in Arlett’s native England, where London’s own head race was held annually in early March.
At that point, crew was not considered a fall sport in the United States. But Cambridge Boat Club members D’Arcy MacMahon, Howard McIntyre, and Jack Vincent liked Arlett’s idea and decided to organize such an event—one that would combine high school, collegiate, and club rowing—to complement their training.
“We had wound up our rowing careers in college and wanted to give something back to the sport that had given us so much,” MacMahon recalls. “So we decided to start a little informal regatta—where emphasis would be on fun, and there wouldn't be too much emphasis on who was winning and who was losing.”
MacMahon thus approached Parker about having his rowers compete, allowing the coach to waive all entry fees.
“I think their primary interest was in masters sculling,” Parker says. “There weren’t any races for master scullers in those days, but they had a number of them at the boat club.”
Like most English rivers, the Charles was too narrow for all competitors to begin at the same time, leading organizers to structure the races so that rowers would start at intervals of approximately 10 seconds and race against the clock.
“We were reasonably sure that it wouldn't work, that it wouldn't  appeal  to anybody because it was the wrong time of year, but we set up  and  decided to try it out,” MacMahon says.
Following the first-ever Regatta—which covered 3.2 miles and passed under six bridges—an IBM computer cataloged the boats’ times into 12 racing divisions.
In the featured “four with cox” race, the Harvard boat of Paul Gunderson, Geoff Picard, Harry Pollock, and Bill Weber—which had represented the United States at the Tokyo Olympics during the summer of 1964—finished second after covering the tricky course in 19:14, 10 seconds behind the winning Penn boat.
“Harry Parker always liked to do long rows,” says Gunderson, who now works as a surgeon in Enumclaw, Wash. “So doing the Head of the Charles was pretty routine for us.”
In the individual races, two rowers representing Eliot House—senior Paul Wilson and junior Larry Fogelberg—won the college singles competition and the 155-pound senior singles division, respectively. (Initially, Harvard houses would enter their own teams because the Ivy League refused to allow its rowers to participate, fearing this would set a dangerous precedent for offseason competition.) Wilson would go on to win the championship singles race in every year from 1967 to 1970.
“[The first Regatta] was pretty low key,” Parker says. “It was cold and windy, but it happened, and it turned out there was a lot more interest than they had anticipated, and it started growing right away.”
RAPID GROWTH
Crews from the Union Boat Club, the University of Wisconsin, and a number of other organizations were added to the Regatta for its second year as attendance soared thanks in part to a misunderstanding.
“The first year certainly nobody came to watch [the race],” MacMahon says. “But afterwards US Rowing printed a manual which reported on rowing activities for the year, so I had to write about the Head of the Charles Regatta. My opening line was ‘Countless thousands lined the shores,’ which was supposed to be humorous, but people believed it and took it literally. A lot of people who weren't there [the first year thus] thought, ‘I better go to this Regatta.’ So it became sort of the thing to go to."
By 1967, 450 oarsmen were competing, already making the Regatta the largest in North America. The race grew to 600 participants the following year, with schools from as far west as Santa Barbara, Calif. taking part.
“It has become for rowing what the Boston Marathon is for running,” The Crimson wrote of the Regatta in 1968, noting that every Ivy League school besides Cornell was represented following the lifting of the league-wide ban on fall varsity crew competition.
In 1968, Harvard won its first Paul Revere Point Trophy, which was awarded to the college, club, or school with the highest number of overall points.
“For quite a while at [the] Cambridge Boat Club, they would rig or skew the points system so that they always won,” Parker says with a laugh. “Then they began to be a little bit more transparent and fair about it, and we began to win quite a few [Revere Trophies], largely because we have a lot of entries.”
Such success was abundant in the final Regatta of the decade, when Harvard oarsmen won the three major team races against an increasingly large field. By 1970, the event had grown to include 900 competitors in 232 boats representing 48 rowing clubs, colleges, and high schools from the United States and Canada.
­Within a half-decade, the Regatta had become the largest in the Western Hemisphere.
“Even in the ’60s it grew quite quickly,” Parker says. “Everybody was surprised, I think the organizers in particular. They made no arrangements for visiting crews.... It was actually quite a burden on the boathouses along the river, Newell in particular. We ended up many of those years with half of the entrants boating in our boathouse. It was a major headache.”
Yet that problem—which Parker says continued into the ’80s—did little to slow the Head’s rapid expansion. In 1973, over 30,000 people showed up to watch the defending national champion Radcliffe eights and the men’s championship four lead the Crimson to another Revere Trophy. The following year’s race featured a then-record 2,530 rowers, and the thousands in attendance—bundled in blankets and consuming rum and fried chicken—were able to watch the reigning World Champion U.S. men’s eight, featuring four Harvard oarsmen, row by. In 1976, Radcliffe won the championship fours race for the second time.
By the decade’s end, the Head was already regarded as “the rowing world’s fall classic” and “the rowing Mecca of the world,” featuring upwards of 3,200 rowers and 720 shells as crowds of 60,000 took in the action.
And thanks to a propitious rule change, Parker was even able to compete at the event himself.
“The international body’s rules declared that paid coaches could not race as amateurs,” Parker explains. “But then in 1973 we changed that rule because we had a coach from Columbia who had stopped coaching and then wanted to compete again.... I remember sitting at that meeting when the vote was taken and thinking, ‘Hey, that means I can compete in the Head of the Charles.’”
That was something Parker would do in the majority of Heads from that point forward.
VICTORY ALL-AROUND
The 1980 Regatta was among the most highly anticipated to date, as it featured a matchup between the West German and American Olympic men’s eight boats—a race that was expected to take place in Moscow the previous summer but did not due to the American boycott.
The United States Olympic Committee provided transportation and living expenses for the racers, who included former Harvard captain Charlie Altekruse ’80. To compete for the Americans, Altekruse returned for the weekend from Germany, where he was studying abroad. Led by Altekruse, the United States took third place in the featured event, finishing behind Navy and West Germany.
“A couple of guys had ballooned up 20, 30 pounds, so we were not in racing form, that’s for sure,” Altekruse recalls. “[But] we had enough residual fitness to get down the course in a reasonable amount of time.”
In 1981, despite concerns over the cleanliness of the Charles, the Regatta had become so popular that organizers had to turn away 300 applicants from spots in the 18 events. The following year, attendance broke the 100,000 mark, and by the middle of the decade, the race had grown to include 3,500 competitors.
“We've had to limit its size because the river wasn't getting any wider,” MacMahon says. “The first year we had a system that limited entries I didn't get in...so it's a system that's incredibly fair.”
Also in 1981, Parker won the veterans’ division race for the first—and to date only—time.
“It was fun because I had been racing against a bunch of those guys in the championship singles over the years,” Parker says. “Obviously we weren’t finishing very high up, with all the young guys, [until] we all moved into the veterans’ division.”
In 1983 Andy Sudduth ’85—one of Parker’s former rowers—also found success at the Head of the Charles when he won the championship singles race. Sudduth, who died in 2006, went on to win the single’s race in five consecutive Regattas while serving as a computer programmer at Harvard.
“It stands out, there’s no question about that,” Parker says. “[Sudduth] was an extraordinary athlete and oarsman.... He’s certainly the best sculler we’ve ever had.”
As Harvard racers continued to win—the Crimson took the championship doubles race in 1984—the Regatta continued to expand. By 1988, it had grown to include 850 boats which raced during a day that now lasted eight hours—more than twice its original length.
“It got to the point where after about 20 years the [Metropolitian District Commission] was going to charge us something outrageous to run it because it was attracting such crowds,” MacMahon says. “So we did everything we could to hold the crowds down. We put the wrong date in the Globe, but it didn't work.”
In the final Regatta of the decade, history was made again when the the 1964 U.S. Olympic men’s eight celebrated the anniversary of its Tokyo gold medal by taking on the 1968 USSR Olympic squad, which came from Lithuania to challenge the Americans.
“We all began to recognize that this was a terrific event and was attracting rowers from all over the country and overseas,” Parker says. “It was a true national celebration of rowing as a sport, and it began to attract national attention.”
THE CRACKDOWN
As interest in the Regatta continued to grow, officials placed a greater focus on those attending it.
During these years, the event had come to have an increasingly festive feel for spectators, who would heavily imbibe champagne and drink from beer kegs and buckets of Bloody Marys. (The Crimson estimated there were 44,000 consumed of the latter in 1985.) In 1987, former Northeastern coach Buzz Congram commented that the race was attended by “drunken stumblebums” who made the event “ugly [and] unruly.” Former BU coach Joe Falco added that the Regatta was “getting out of hand...[with] more people getting drunk than watching the races.”
Such activity led to a crackdown by the Metropolitan District Commission, making 1987 “the first (allegedly) rowdiness-free Head of the Charles Regatta weekend,” according to The Crimson.
“[The changes came] all of a sudden,” Parker says. “The MDC just suddenly took a ban on alcohol. Came around and confiscated it without much notice ahead of time.”
According to a 1987 Crimson piece, Harvard administrators also “decided to exercise unprecedented authority over the Harvard community and the banks of the Charles in an attempt to curtail the craziness that has plagued the Heads of the past.”
Outsider access was strictly limited in all Houses, and parties were banned in some. The MDC assigned 300 police officers to the Regatta and threatened to cancel the event in the future if behavior did not change.
The security crackdown infuriated the student body.
“The only thing [this] will accomplish is the suffocation of Harvard’s none-too-healthy social life,” wrote The Crimson in one 1987 editorial.
The new measures worked, with the result that by decade’s end, on Head of the Charles weekend, “a Saturday night reveler would have had an easier time getting into heaven than into Eliot House,” according to the newspaper. But in the short term, they also served to diminish the number of attendees.
“[The new measures] changed the tone of the Regatta for spectators significantly,” Parker says. “It went from having huge crowds all around the river to much smaller ones.”
The small crowds did not last, but student complaints persisted.
In the ’90s, the extra security measures continued to dominate undergraduate storylines on race weekend. They led one student to compare the school to a “prison,” another to comment that the measures made it “one of the worst weekends [at Harvard],” and a 1994 Crimson editorial to be entitled “Students Suffer on Head Weekend.”
“The commie pinko pigs are trying to ruin our lives,” said one student in 1995, adding that he was going to Brown to escape the Regatta weekend crackdown.
These sentiments notwithstanding, the administration continued to emphasize strict security measures and guest and party limitations during Head of the Charles weekend, and such policies remain in place today.
THE REVIVAL
Despite the short-term drop in attendance that such measures brought about in the late ’80s, interest in participating in the Regatta itself continued to rise as the new decade began.
“About 1990, somewhere in that time frame, the Regatta became so popular that they restricted you so that you could only row one time,” says Altekruse, who now runs a consulting company in Berkeley, Calif. “Before 1990 we could row multiple times.... When I was an undergrad, I rowed three times in a day, which is unbelievable.”
In 1990, television crews from the documentary series American Chronicles filmed competitors in the 25th edition of the Regatta, which had returned to drawing crowds (now much more family-friendly) of 200,000 and included participants from more than 250 colleges and athletic clubs.
By 1992, the number of racers had broken the 4,000 mark, and the once alcohol-soaked banks had been overtaken by a number of food and business vendors from around Boston.
Though the Regatta was canceled due to heavy rain for the first time in 1996, officials expanded the competition into a two-day event in 1997 thanks in part to the revived attendance.
That year, hundreds of companies distributed everything ranging from apple cider to mouthwash while the Crimson men’s heavyweight crew’s second-place finish behind the U.S. national team excited many.
In 1998, MacMahon's son started the Head of the Charles Regatta Charity Program, which has since raised over $650,000 for its official charities, which include Cambridge Community Foundation and Community Rowing, Inc.
“The good that comes out of [the Regatta] isn't really entertaining the public, it’s doing some good for non-profits in Cambridge and Boston communities” MacMahon says. “I think the charity aspect has been very important.”
Meanwhile, the 35th edition of the race in 1999 brought an estimated crowd of 300,000 people, who had an opportunity to enjoy free samples from Dunkin’ Donuts and Ben & Jerry’s as well as a variety of foods ranging from Italian sausages to clam chowder.
“The Head of the Charles has done a pretty aggressive job of promoting corporate interests, putting up tents for retailers and the like,” Parker says. “So it has a very different flavor to it [than when it began].”
This fact is one that still bothers MacMahon.
“I am concerned about the degree to which [the Regatta has] become commercial,” he says. “We built it into the largest regatta in the world without any one of us being paid to do anything. Now it has a budget of a million dollars a year.... It's because it became so big that it required corporate sponsorship to keep it going. It's sort of a necessary evil.”
THE MODERN ERA
By the mid-2000s, the race had expanded to include 1,500 boats and 7,000 rowers—turning away 1,000 entries—and had added a showcase of Boston bands. Today, it features 1,900 boats and 9,000 competitors—ranging in age from 14 to 84—as well as 55 events that routinely draw crowds of 300,000 picnickers, frisbee-throwers, and crew fans who enjoy the wide array of different foods, apparel, and product samples.
“[When I raced] there weren’t as many vendors and it wasn’t as commercial as it’s become,” Altekruse says. “It was much more of a cow pasture regatta back then.”
But the winding, 3.2-mile course beginning at DeWolfe Boathouse and ending just before Northeastern’s Henderson Boathouse remains the same, often challenging racers who are expected to navigate six bridges and a number of turns that often lead to collisions.
“There’s always the home-team advantage,” Gunderson says. “If you know how to cut the corners a bit, you’re that much better off.”
Though the event has also become more internationalized over the years—with rowers from 19 countries partaking in last year’s edition—many traditions have remained the same. The 1972 Olympic team has returned to the Regatta for a reunion every year since the Munich Games—tomorrow will be its 40th consecutive appearance—and the 1980 Olympic squad has done the same since its Games.
“There was a special chemistry of how we rowed and how we raced together,” Altekruse says of his 1980 team. “That chemistry has to some degree prevailed to this day and it allows us to come together really with just a Friday afternoon practice and be competitive year after year for the top two or three places, and I think that’s the most remarkable thing to me.”
Over the years, a number of Harvard and Radcliffe teams have found similar success, winning 40 Head championships in total. Last year’s men’s heavyweight crew won the premier eights race at the Regatta for the first time in 34 years, helping the Crimson earn the MacMahon Cup Regatta Point Trophy—named after the organizer—for the “non-traditional” (club or collegiate) team that demonstrates “overall rowing supremacy at the Regatta.”
“I’d say it was probably my favorite race ever, just because our success was such a surprise,” says junior Andrew Reed, who was one of the premier eights racers. “We went in with no expectations at all, so to come out winning just felt so great.”
That excitement is shared by many who participate in the Regatta, which since originating on a dreary October day has continued to grow over nearly a half-century and has now become one of the most revered traditions in the sport.
“It’s amazing when you have an event like that, when there’s so many crews on the water at one time,” Gunderson says. “It’s a real unique thing—there aren’t many places where you can see that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, senior Harvard heavyweight rower Josh Hicks helped bring home a silver medal for his native Australia as a member of the U-23 national team. Little did he know that his path to the national team would begin as a collegiate rower.
Now a senior on the Crimson squad, Hicks has been instrumental to the program’s success from the start.
“He’s one of those guys who, since the very beginning of freshman year, has always been at the top of the squad physically,” says fellow senior rower Jason Phillips. “He jumped right in and started moving towards the top, and he’s been in the best boats ever since.”
Former teammate Matt Edstein ’12, who is now involved with the Australian national team, succinctly summed up the reason for Hicks’ ascent.
“When Josh first joined the varsity squad in his sophomore year, we coined the nickname ‘Desire’ for him,” Edstein wrote in an email because he could not be reached by phone. “It basically sums up how he approaches training and racing: with a lot of heart and tenacity.”
Hicks’ “desire” and rowing skill have led him from his home in Perth, Australia to the banks of the Charles River and to Trakai, Lithuania, for the 2012 U-23 World Championships.
His high school cross country and rowing coach, Phil Jurjevich, raves about the senior’s incredible work ethic and strength, especially given his relatively small stature for a rower.
“Josh doesn’t lose intensity,” Jurjevich notes. “He’s very strong for his height and just has a ridiculous tank and engine. He’s always had the ability to push himself 10 out of 10 where other rowers might be at, say, a six out of 10.”
Harvard heavyweight coach Harry Parker, celebrating his 51st year as head coach of the Crimson, says Hicks sets an excellent example for his teammates.
“His motivation is the aspect of his rowing that impresses the other guys on the team the most,” Parker says. “They recognize how motivated he is, how hard he trains, and how much effort he puts into his rowing.”
Although he did not start until he was 14, Hicks quickly threw himself into rowing.
“I started rowing basically because my school was next to the river,” Hicks says. “Everyone else played basketball and every school had a basketball ring, but my dad pointed out that not every school gave you the opportunity to go splash around in the river, so I started rowing.”
Hicks was also a champion cross country runner at the time. He went undefeated in high school in open meets and set the conference record in the 1,500-meter race his senior year.
Jurjevich recalls a particularly telling episode detailing the young runner’s tireless nature.
“Before a meet, four runners went into the city several kilometers away to get food,” Jurjevich recounts. “Three of them made it, but Josh was finishing his food and the bus took off just as he approached. He ran the whole way back, chasing the bus as the boys watched him out the back window.”
“Somehow, he made it to the meet at the same time as the bus,” Jurjevich laughs.
Hicks says he sees a parallel between cross country and rowing.
“With both cross country and rowing, you can see yourself tangibly improving, and it’s wonderful,” Hicks says. “You can see yourself getting faster over time, and that gives you a sense of self-worth, to see your individual improvements rewarded.”
According to teammate and fellow senior James O’Connor, Hicks strikes a good balance between fun and focus.
“Outside the boathouse, he’s a real character,” O’Connor says. “He’s got his motorbike and he loves to ride it, but when he’s at the boathouse, he always brings his ‘A’ game.”
Hicks says that O’Connor and Phillips—who are from New Zealand and London, respectively—are part of a wave of foreign oarsmen who have come to Harvard and other American universities to row.
“Part of the reason I came to Harvard is that there’s the concept of the student-athlete that doesn’t really exist in Australia,” Hicks says. “The programs there aren’t affiliated with the university. Plus, it’s not like we’re getting a degree and mucking around on the river every so often—training at Harvard is twice a day. It’s the best combination of athletics and academics.”
To this end, Rowing Australia has recognized that many Australians come to the United States to row at the collegiate level and has set up a system to retain American-based rowers within the Australian system.
“For two summers now, [Rowing Australia has] set up a U.S.-based boat that Australians at American universities can try out for,” says Crimson associate head coach Bill Manning. “The first year, it was a slow boat, but this past summer, they were able to recruit the best Australians for the boat, including Josh.”
Hicks is thankful that the Australian federation makes it so easy for U.S.-based athletes like him to compete.
“We’re so grateful, because they really didn’t have to. We’re just a bunch of Aussies who [go] off to America and, to a certain extent, leave them high and dry,” Hicks says. “I’m almost apologetic because I can understand if Australian athletes at home are upset. At the same time though, we’ve had really good results in that boat and all of the guys in the boat had represented Australia before and have had plenty of experience.”
Last June, Hicks went to Princeton to try out for the U-23 team in hopes of making it to the U-23 World Championships in Lithuania.
“We went down to Princeton and tried out in pairs, did some racing, and they added up whoever had the lowest times after several races,” Hicks says. “The four with the lowest time made the boat.”
Hicks made the team and immediately commenced training.
“I spent three weeks training intensively there with coach Tom Laurich, and it was a lot of fun,” Hicks says.
Despite having a compressed time frame compared to the other Australian boats, which were put together in April, Hicks and his boat were able to earn a silver for Australia at the championships in July.
Hicks valued both the experience of rowing for the national team and the medal he brought home with him.
“The Aussie team was great—I just got to hang out with a bunch of other Aussies who love the sport that I love,” Hicks says. “Some people get choked up about representing their country—and don’t get me wrong, it is an honor and privilege and I’m humbled to represent Australia—but what it really boils down to is out-rowing the competition.”
Mike DiSanto ’12, a former teammate now with the American squad, says Hicks is prepared for the next level of competition—the Australian national team.
“To make that jump, you have to commit yourself every day, and Josh will  be able to do that,” DiSanto says. “At the same time, you have to make sure you’re working well in the system, but Josh is an extremely likeable guy, so he’ll be fine.”
“I’m just excited to see the [Australian] team get better, but this is a U-23 rower speaking,” Hicks adds. “If I’m lucky enough to not even make the team, but just push the guys who are on the team to be better—then that’ll be fantastic for me, and my rowing goals will have been achieved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For lightweight rowers Andrew Campbell and Austin Meyer, the Head of the Charles Regatta will mark their first competition back in a Harvard boat after a year spent away from school vying for a spot in the 2012 London Olympics. Ultimately, neither rower reached the Games.
“This will be my first time on a large collegiate crew team in around 15 months,” Campbell remarks. “Life on a college crew team is much different than training on a small boat internationally. It makes practicing and training that much more fun.”
Last spring, Campbell and Meyer began their respective quests to make the U.S. Olympic Team as competitors rather than teammates. In April, both rowers competed in doubles at the Non-Qualified Olympic Small Boat Trials. Campbell and his partner Will Daly finished first—ahead of Meyer’s boat by about six seconds—and advanced to the Final Olympic Qualification Regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland.
But at that regatta, Campbell and Daly narrowly missed landing a spot on the team. They were edged out by about a second for one of the top two finishes, bringing their Olympic prospects to an end.
Campbell quickly got back to training to channel his frustration at the outcome in Lucerne.
“I sat idle for about two weeks after [the qualification regatta], but I grew restless and needed an outlet to make it feel better again,” Campbell says. “So, I got back in the single, which I really enjoyed. The single was my first true love in rowing.”
Campbell went on to compete at the Henley Royal Regatta in June, where he raced individually in the prestigious Diamond Challenge Sculls event. Campbell made it as far as the semifinals and then fell to South Africa’s Peter Lambert, who went on to secure the Henley title.
“Henley was an obvious choice because it was low pressure and really fun, but high competition,” Campbell says. “I had a great regatta, which boosted my confidence following the Olympic letdown.”
After Campbell’s strong showing at Henley, he decided to keep rowing the single and represent the U.S. in the 2012 Senior World Rowing Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He won a bronze medal in the event.
“I think having that opportunity to compete at the international level and represent the U.S. was a way to take away some of the sting of being so close to making the U.S. Olympic team,” says Linda Muri, who coaches the Crimson freshman lightweights as well as Campbell and Meyer individually.
After his own Olympic disappointment, Meyer took a different course. He paired up with fellow American rower Nick Trojan to race at the U-23 World Championships. In the final of the event, Meyer’s boat finished fourth with a time of 6:54.33, marking the best-ever finish for an American crew.
Although they were competitors this summer, Campbell and Meyer say the shared experience competing on the international level has brought them closer together. And now that they have both returned to race with Harvard this season, they will be rowing side by side in the first varsity boat.
“We both have the same goal,” Meyer says. “I think it’s awesome to have two young guys from Harvard finish one-two at Olympic trials. I think that’s really promising for the future…. We both have a lot of respect for each other.”
The Crimson lightweights’ success last season has also helped to ease the transition back to collegiate rowing for Campbell and Meyer.
“The team this year is phenomenal,” Meyer says. “Many of the guys are returning from winning National Championships. I’m coming back to a really experienced group of guys. I’m blending in pretty well.”
Now seasoned rowers on the international stage, Campbell and Meyer are looking forward to competing on the familiar Charles River.
“[Head of the Charles] is the biggest [two-day] regatta in the world,” Muri says. “Even though it’s in our backyard, it’s still a big deal.… People who have competed in the Olympics are always happy to come back to the Head of the Charles. I know Andrew and Austin are looking forward to it as well. Everyone wants to race.”
And for many of the rowers, the regatta is almost as much a social event as it is a competition.
“Head of the Charles is one of those events for me where I get to see so many people from around the world that I know through rowing,” Meyer says. “It’s an awesome atmosphere, and it’s our home course. We get pumped up the most for Head of the Charles.”
As Campbell and Meyer get re-acclimated both to collegiate rowing and life as Harvard students, the question still remains as to whether the rowers will contend for spots on the 2016 Olympic team. Both Campbell and Meyer acknowledged tentative plans to train but deemed it too soon to know definitively.
“I would be shocked if they didn’t,” Muri says. “They are both very competitive, driven young men with tremendous amounts of talent. I can see them going on for another four years. They were so close, this time who knows. They have every opportunity to represent the U.S. in Rio in 2016.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than a month away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. On Tuesday we profiled UMass. Next up is Manhattan College.
The last time the Harvard men's basketball team faced off against Manhattan College, the players on this 2012-2013 team hadn't even been born. The Crimson will host the Jaspers on Nov. 16 for the ninth ever meeting of the two teams and the first since the 1987-88 season, during which Harvard lost the matchup, 77-66.
Last season, Manhattan posted a 21-13 overall record and went 12-6 in the MAAC. TIt fell in the first round of the conference tournament in a tight overtime contest with Siena College, 82-84.
The Jaspers faced three Ivy foes in 2011, besting Brown by two points in a 54-52 win but dropping games against Columbia and Penn.
While Manhattan’s record last season may not have hinted at greatness, its performance improved upon the previous year by 15 wins. The team also made it to postseason play, attending the CollegeInsider.com tournament for the first time in six years.
The Jaspers’ coach Steve Masiello, who was a walk-on at Kentucky under Rick Pitino in the late 1990s, joined Manhattan just last year after serving as an assistant to Pitino at Louisville. His turnaround of last year’s team was the biggest in the nation and electrified the Manhattan fan base.
The team is led by 6’4” senior guard George Beamon, who netted 19.1 points per game in 2011-2012 and captured the most points in the MAAC with 626 on the season. Following Beamon is sophomore foward Emmy Andujar who put up 105 assists, a team record, and came second in scoring with 8.5 points per game.
In the post, Andujar will likely be flanked by veteran fowards Rhamel Brown and Roberto Colonette, and at 6’10”, freshman center Adam Lacey will add height to the trio.
In the backcourt, Beamon and junior guard Michael Alvarado will be scoring threats, while freshman guard C.J. Jones could also provide a spark for the Jaspers' offense.

You may have noticed it's autumn because midterms have rolled around and you're starting to shiver in your short-shorts. The businesses of Cambridge, meanwhile, know that it's fall and we can tell because they've started selling pumpkin lattes and apple bath bombs. Now, Flyby explores the various fall specials around the Square.
Conveniently located in the Yard, Cafe Gato Rojo has an Autumn Harvest Latte which they tout as a "rich and spicy tea latte sweetened with honey."
A few blocks over, Clover is advertising both its hot mulled cider and a Harvest Dinner that will take place this Friday (with baked beans and sweet potato bars being served, only 10 tickets are left and can be reserved here).
Lizzy's now has pumpkin pie ice cream, while J.P. Licks is making its transition from summer to autumn by offering hot apple cider, maple spice lattes, apple "chaider" (that's chai and apple cider), as well as maple walnut scones, frosted pumpkin loaves, and cupcakes topped with plastic pumpkins.
Just off the square, Peet's Coffee & Tea has its own pumpkin Freddo, pumpkin chai latte, and cinnamon gingerbread latte.
Over on Brattle St., Crema Cafe is offering a fall spice cupcake with apple compote and chai buttercream.
L.A. Burdick, meanwhile, is selling Halloween graveyard chocolate sets containing Halloween Harvard squares, chocolate ghosts, and an assortment of chocolate coffins.
For those seeking the smell, rather than the taste, of autumn, Lush has a collection of Halloween and fall-themed items, including pumpkin soap and a bath fizzer made from apple and cinnamon; The Body Shop has also released its holiday scents, which include ginger and cranberry-scented lotions and perfumes.

Because Harvard doesn't already present enough ways for students to get politically involved, every four years the school offers Gov 1359: Road to the White House.
Taught by Lecturer on Government Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo, the class meets twice a week and teaches students the fundamentals of a presidential campaign. Lecture topics include the effect that debates have on elections, how candidates prepare for public speaking, and the presidential image that candidates are expected to exude.
Starting with the nomination and caucus processes and moving all the way through the final vote, the class discusses the campaign from multiple perspectives. In addition to the expected political science analysis of how campaigns are run, students use data to analyze the efficacy of polling methods and, according to the course syllabus, must "incorporate the insights of historians, economists, journalists, and campaign insiders."
"I feel like it's given me a really good perspective of what it takes to run a successful campaign," said Akshay M. Sharma '14. "We've gone over things that as an American I had been exposed to my entire life but had never been able to fully appreciate. The amount of planning and detail and the production value that goes into a presidential election is incredible."

Despite Harvard's emphasis on a liberal arts education and last year's Occupy Harvard movement, a sizable number of students often hit up Wall Street after graduation. According to the Office of Career Services, 17 percent of the Class of 2011 entered the "financial services" sector, which is down from 28 percent in 2008 but is still the most popular post-graduate endeavor. Harvard alum Henry Wong thinks he knows why.In a recent post in Forbes, he contends that because Harvard is full of students who "excel at conforming to social expectations" and because the school "doesn't select for iconoclasts and the unconventional types," students join Wall Street because it is an obvious indicator of conventional success.
 
To an extent, many students seem to agree that Wong has a point. "Two-thirds of the freshman class takes Ec10. While I purposefully chose not to go into it, a lot of people do go into that kind of thing," said Don Y. Kim '16. Other students also agree that exploring economics and finance is a default at Harvard. "It's the standard—if you don't quite know what you want to do, you take Ec10. If I don't know what my passion is, I might as well make money," said Jacob M. Colbath-Hess '16. In addition to practical matters such as income after graduation, Nina M. Khosrowsalafi '13 notes that jobs in finance or consulting are relatively attainable for students. "I don't know if it's conformity or if it's that these opportunities are presented to us and brought to our doorsteps," she said. "This might not happen at other schools, but when I go on Crimson Careers, every other job is consulting or finance, so it's easy for students here to explore that area."

 Scared  of rejection? Don't want to spend another Faculty Dinner eaten  stolen d-hall cereal alone in your dorm room? Fear not! We've got your back with a few foolproof proposals to guarantee  your professor won't say "no" (or "who are you?"). 
 
Slip a note in your term paper
If  you have an essay due for one of your classes, this is the perfect way  to ask your professor to the faculty dinner. Not only will it make for a  pleasant surprise, but it will also help you reach your page limit. If  you want to seal the deal you can even incorporate the invite into your  thesis. The faculty dinner has everything to do with democratization in  the Middle East. 
 
Let him/her ask you
Manipulate the situation so that your professor asks you to dinner. Do whatever it takes to be the last one out of lecture.  Fumble with your backpack, drop pens and pencils all over the ground, or  just stand there awkwardly for a couple minutes. Then, when you're left  alone with the professor, sigh loudly and subtly hint that you have no  one to go with the faculty dinner with. "Oh so it looks like I have no one to go to the faculty dinner with... cough cough. Hey professor, did you hear that?" Your professor should catch on from there, especially if you repeat yourself a few times. 
 
Office Hours
This  one is perfect if your TF or professor holds office hours in a cafe.  When you go in for office hours, offer to buy her a latte, then  quickly write a message on the cup. "Will you go to the  Faculty dinner with me? Grande Soy Milk Latte" should do the trick. 
 
Hijack the lecture
Time  to put those CS50 skills to work. Take over the monitor during lecture,  and in big, bold, obnoxious letters, with blinding, flashing neon  colors, make your proposal. It can't hurt to throw in some GIFs  of adorable animals for good measure. It's sure to give the whole class a  laugh, and the professor will be so impressed he'll have to say yes!

If you were just sleeping in Lamont, we're pretty sure you woke up to the sounds of a very loud fire alarm. Indeed, Lamont was evacuated due to a drill at 3:15 p.m. today. Luckily, the sun was shining outside and it wasn't too cold. Now go back to sleep. Or, er, studying.

After a stressful day filled with midterm exams, there's nothing worse than deciding to take a shower and realizing that you ran out of shampoo. This week, you can restock for free in Weld or in Quincy.
Momba, the company that recently installed two dorm-essential vending machines on Harvard's campus, has launched a sales promotion featuring free shampoos and conditioners. The promotion, which started on Oct. 17, will last until next Thursday.
Steven R. Duque '08, founder of Momba, explained that this promotion was meant to make things a little easier for stressed students.
"I remember that when I was a student at Harvard midterms were one of the most stressful times, and the first thing to go is taking care of oneself," he said.
If you don't live in either Quincy or Weld and the trip to CVS is getting less appealing as the year goes on, you can contact Duque about installing a machine in your own House or dorm.
"I'd love to expand within Harvard. Any House that is interested in getting a machine can feel free to just reach out to me directly and I'd be happy to get the process started," he said.
In the meantime, go get your free shampoo and conditioner and stay tuned for more promotions.
"The best place to find future promotions is our Facebook page. We'll be posting our promotions throughout the year," Duque said.
