After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Remembered by his co-workers as someone who enjoyed music and good humor, Lyonel Louis-Jean, an assistant cook in Adams Dining Hall, died Wednesday morning at the age of 55.
Louis-Jean joined Harvard University Dining Services in January 1987. He worked exclusively at Adams Dining Hall for the past 25 years.
“He was always for the house,” said Gary C. Davis, who has worked in the Adams Dining Hall for 30 years. “Students were always number one for him.”
Louis-Jean’s co-workers described him as a hard worker who also brought an air of levity to the job.
During his time at Harvard, he was promoted from a kitchen receiver to an assistant cook.
“He can be very serious, but always makes jokes,” said Adams Dining Hall worker Marie G. Perpignant.
She said she commuted to work with Louis-Jean every morning and valued the friendship they had formed over the past 25 years.
Louis-Jean was committed to supporting his colleagues.
“If anyone was behind he would jump in and help out,” Davis said.
As a Haitian immigrant who spoke Creole, Louis-Jean served as an interpreter for those who were not fluent in English and clarified any issues between the workers and the union.
“If you have a problem, he will defend you until the end,” Perpignant said.
Louie-Jean’s brother, Jacques Louis-Jean, also works at Harvard as a financial assistant for Campus Services. He described his brother as quiet and hardworking, but also light-hearted.
“I had a very good relationship. He was serious and funny at the same time,” Jacques Louis-Jean said.“He is my brother, my little brother.”
Louis-Jean was also passionate about music, his co-workers said. They recalled Louis-Jean walking in to the Adams Junior Common Room during breaks to write music and play the piano every single day.
“He was always with his music,” another member of the Adams Dining Hall staff Gabriela M. Pucci said.
Davis said that once he noticed that someone was disposing of an old organ and called Louis-Jean because he knew he would appreciate it.  
“I knew that if anyone was going to use it, it would be him,” Davis said.
In an email to Adams residents, Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell expressed the community’s sorrow for the loss.
“You should know we (and HUDS) are doing all we can to make sure [the dining hall staff] are supported in this sad moment,” she wrote. “But your support will surely mean a great deal as well.”
Louis-Jean is survived by his wife and two sons, ages 25 and 19.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students took to the stage to increase awareness about violence against women and girls in a performance of Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues as part of a global V-Day movement.
The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and Harvard College Women’s Center co-sponsored the student production which featured 20 short scenes that included both comic and heart-wrenching tributes to women around the world.
V-Day, which was started in 1998 by Ensler, is a global movement devoted to ending violence against women and girls.
Last year, there were more than 5,800 events celebrating V-Day around the world—many of which were held on college campuses across the U.S.
Events each year range from productions of The Vagina Monologues to film screenings to community briefings.
The goal of these events is to increase awareness and raise funds for anti-violence charities and organizations, said Sarah A. Rankin, director of OSAPR.
The proceeds from ticket sales benefited My Life My Choice, a local non-profit combatting the commercial sexual exploitation of teenage girls, and the V-Day Foundation’s Spotlight Campaign on the Women and Girls of Haiti.
The students involved in the production of the show were responsible for choosing a charity, according to Rankin.
“This year we decided to pick an agency that was small so it makes a big impact,” Rankin said.
Many of the monologues presented dealt with issues of violence against women. Several scenes directly addressed rape, violence facing the transgender community and female genital mutilation.
However the show also featured more light-hearted moments, including “My Angry Vagina,” a trio rant performed by Kimberly A. Onah ’15, Zoey A. Bergstrom ’15 and Leila H. Shayegan ’14 about tampons, thongs, and visits to the gynecologist.
“What If I Told You I Didn’t Have a Vagina”, performed by Susan Fendell, Alice Abracen ’15, and Zuzanna K. Wojcieszak ’13, was dedicated to the City of Joy, a community of women rape survivors in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo, which was co-developed by V-Day, UNICEF, and the Panzi Foundation.
Maddie L. Coveno ’14 and Christina C. Twicken ’14 performed “My Vagina Was My Village,” a monologue in honor of the thousands of victims of rape as a “systematic tactic of war” in Kosovo and Bosnia in the 1990s.
“I hope that people who have never seen the monologues before start thinking about sexual assault and violence on a global scale,” said Rankin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chelsea Janes, of the Yale Daily News, recently published a column in which she argued that the Bulldogs may be in the midst of their greatest athletic season ever. Janes cites, among other things, the—albeit unlikely—potential for Yale to win the most Ivy League titles in the history of its athletic program. In 1958-59, the Bulldogs took home eight Ivy League titles; that was before Title IX and the emergence of women’s athletics, which added 16 women’s teams to the mix. Janes makes this point exhaustively, but somehow forgets to realize that this means the 2011-12 edition would have to win far more than eight titles in order to surpass ’58-59’s dominance.
We’ll forgive her illogical use of numbers—after all, when choosing her school she clearly thought #3 was better than #1—and instead hit her back with some numbers of our own:
2 – The number of Rhodes scholarship “candidates” on your campus in the fall. But that's when things started to fall apart. Within the next few months, Yale football coach Tom Williams resigned amid allegations that he lied on his resume about, among other things, his candidacy for the scholarship. And your star quarterback, Pat Witt, dealt with a nasty fall from grace of his own after the New York Times reported that Witt was accused of sexual assault .
45-7 - The score in this year’s installment of the game, which you guys hosted. I think any year in which your rival ends the biggest game of the year with their fans celebrating on your field has got to be considered one of the best sports years of all-time…right??
2006 – The last time your football team beat Harvard
30 – The score differential when the Crimson men’s basketball team took on the Bulldogs. In New Haven. Again.
1 – The spot your men’s hockey team held in the national rankings at one point last season. Now they’re ranked behind the Crimson, and Harvard has 11 ties.
5-4 – the score of the Ivy League championship in squash. Harvard beat Yale, by the way. You noted in your column that sophomore Millie Tomlinson “keeps blowing through her competition.” That is, until she lost three straight sets to Crimson freshman Amanda Sobhy.
0 – the number of victories, combined, between your men’s and women’s fencing teams over the Crimson. In your article, you noted that “fencing is a sport to watch,” when discussing potential ancient eight championships. Considering you’ve never written a story about fencing, and I can’t imagine you frequent that many fencing matches, I’m guessing you meant it in the theoretical sense. I.e. “Even though it won’t be fun because we’re not very good, New Haven is so boring that fencing is a sport to watch.”
8 – The number of goals Harvard’s women’s hockey team beat you guys by. Chelsea! You’re the women’s hockey beat-writer! You lost by eight! In HOCKEY!
1 – The number of Jeremy Lin’s ’10 who attended your rival institution
In justifying writing a story so prematurely, you noted that “By Feb. 7, 2011, Yale held one Ivy title. As of Feb. 8, 2012, we hold two.” By that logic, I’m going to predict that Rick Santorum is going to win the Republican Presidential primary. By Feb. 4, 2012, Santorum held one state. As of Feb. 15, 2012 he holds four. Also, as of two weeks ago, there were no Harvard grads starting in the NBA. Now that Jeremy Lin is playing for the Knicks, I predict that there will be six former Crimson players in the league at this time next year. To borrow from you, “[it] is perhaps not wise. But it’s not completely unrealistic.”
In the second paragraph of your column you said “I’m not just saying that out of my sometimes unrealistic but always well-intended Yale-superfan optimism. The stats don’t lie.”
Sure, the stats don’t lie, if you choose which stats to look at and which ones to ignore. Maybe you should stick to speculating about whether or not Harvard actually sucks and leave the homerism to those who know what they’re doing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Linsanity has reached the retail world.
Jeremy Lin apparel has been flying off the shelves in stores, in Madison Square Garden, and online.  Lin jerseys were even sold at Harvard’s Lavietes Pavilion during the Harvard vs. Brown Men’s Basketball game on Friday night.
But, for one important spectator, sporting a classic Knicks Jersey was not enough to show his Lin pride.  Spike Lee, an avid Knicks fan, decided to go old school.
On Friday night at Madison Square Garden, Lee was spotted wearing green, rather than blue and orange.  Lee had made special arrangement to wear Lin’s high school jersey.  Before the Knicks and Harvard Basketball, Lin was number 4 on the Palo Alto High School basketball team.
According the Wall Street Journal, Lin’s high school coach, Peter Diepenbrock, had joked to a radio station in the Big Apple about dressing Lee in Vikings apparel.  Lee was excited about the idea and made it happen for Friday night’s contest against New Orleans.  Lin and Lee greeted each other briefly before the game.
It seems that the reminder of Lin’s high school days was more of a curse than a blessing.  The Knicks seven-game winning streak was broken in a close loss to the Hornets.  Lin scored 26 points and made five assists in the contest, but also committed nine turnovers to cement the 89-85 loss.
Lin and the Knicks take on the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday at 1:00pm at Madison Square Garden.

For the second consecutive weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball exchanged a Friday night straight-set loss for a Saturday afternoon straight-set win, as the Crimson downed St. Francis, 3-0, Saturday at the Malkin Athetic Center.
Behind strong team service and impressive performances from the middle hitters, Harvard (7-2, 2-2 EIVA) took control early and never looked back, dispatching the Red Flash (6-7, 3-1) in less than an hour.
The result gave Harvard a split of the weekend’s slate of conference games and allowed the squad to keep its spot in the top half of the EIVA standings.
“All the different aspects of our game seemed to be working really well,” sophomore libero Chris Gibbons said. “We had struggled with that in the past and [on Friday] in the Penn State match, but...St. Francis didn’t rise up to match us, and the game was basically ours from the get-go.”
With St. Francis ahead, 2-1, early in the first set, freshman middle hitter Caleb Zimmick notched two successive kills, giving the Crimson a lead it did not give up for the remainder of the match.
Zimmick posted another strong day in his freshman campaign, registering nine kills and nine blocks and dominating the middle of the court.
“Caleb had a really good day in the middle over [the Red Flash middle hitter],” said sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden. “He was able to read him really well.”
And while St. Francis traded points early, a 13-3 Harvard run took the visitors out of contention, as two Red Flash timeouts could not stop the slide. With the set out of sight, Harvard eased its way to taking the first set, eventually doubling up the St. Francis, 25-12.
The Crimson’s defensive execution played a key role in the dominant run.
“Our serve-receive passing was very good,” Madden said. “We were getting a lot of good defensive balls up. We weren’t putting balls 10 feet off the net; we were putting balls pretty close, so we had many options running.”
“It also helped that our middle hitters were hitting well, so that opened it up for the outside,” Madden added.
And Madden and captain outside hitter Matt Jones took advantage, as they combined for four kills during the 13-3 run and seventeen kills on the day.
Harvard again looked strong in the second set, as the team took a 14-9 lead after trading early points with the St. Francis.
A well-timed Red Flash timeout helped temporarily shift the momentum, as St. Francis tied the game at 16 apiece. But the Crimson’s effective hitting and serving gave Harvard control, winning nine of the next 14 points to take the set, 25-21.
To open the third frame, three consecutive Red Flash attack errors and a service ace from Madden gave the Crimson a 4-0 lead. Behind more strong service and defense, the Crimson fought to a 25-16 victory to take the 3-0 sweep.
Part of Harvard’s success on Saturday came from the team’s scouting and film session, which immediately paid off in the game.
“We scouted them pretty intensely, so we knew the tendency of the hitters,” Madden said. “The middles were really on top of their stuff; they were able to get out and close the blocks.”
Gibbons agreed, saying the preparation made the defensive game plan easier to execute.
“We knew where different hitters of theirs like to hit, and our defenders were able to pick up a lot of their swings,” Gibbons said. “We were able to slow their offense down and allow our offense to pick up, so we were able to execute what [Harvard] coach [Brian] Baise wanted us to do.”
In its four conference games so far this season, the Crimson has only played 12 sets, either winning or losing all four times in straight sets.
Madden believes it is indicative of the quality in the league and knows how important it is to stay in the top half of the EIVA.
“There is definitely a discrepancy in the league between the top couple of teams and the bottom couple,” Madden said. “We’ll be playing many of these teams again.... Hopefully, we can get some wins and end up with only two or three league losses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding a four-match losing streak going into Saturday’s contest against Columbia, the No. 25 Harvard wrestling team looked to finish its regular season on a positive note.
But the Lions (8-4, 4-3 EIWA) stifled the Crimson’s search for victory in a 30-12 bout at Columbia’s University Gymnasium.
Four Harvard (5-10, 2-7 EIWA) wrestlers posted wins on the day while as many from Columbia recorded falls.
The afternoon began with a 10-5 decision for the Lions’ Robert Dyar over freshman Max Mejia at 125 pounds. Dyar managed two takedowns and a two-point near-fall that put Mejia down, 6-1, to start. Mejia scored four points from two takedowns, but with two more reversals by Dyar, Mejia was unable to come back, and Columbia earned the first team points of the match.
Next on the mat for the Crimson, wrestling at the 133-pound weight class, came No. 12 junior Steven Keith.
Keith didn’t allow his opponent to score a single point, handling him, 5-0, to tie Harvard with the Lions at three.
“There are still some things I can work on,” Keith said. “I’m definitely not at my best yet, but we’ve got the conference tournament coming up and then the NCAAs, and I’m feeling pretty confident about it.”
The turning point of the match happened at the 141-pound class.
Harvard junior Shay Warren and Columbia’s Matt Bystol scrambled with each other all match, both managing only an escape in regulation. With the scoreboard locked at one, Warren and Bystol headed into extra periods.
After the first minute saw no score from either side, Bystol maneuvered a takedown in the second overtime to earn him the victory.
“[Warren] had an amazing match,” Keith said. “He showed a lot of heart and good wrestling.”
With the loss, the Crimson fell behind the Lions again, 6-3.
At the 149 class, freshman Patrick Hogan was down 8-0 before Columbia’s Steve Santos pinned him at 5:34.
No. 7 junior co-captain Walter Peppelman wrestled next at 157 pounds, besting his foe, 5-0.
With the team score at 12-6, sophomore Ian Roy and his opponent Eren Civan were at a 2-2 tie going into the third period.
But just as it looked like the match was headed into overtime, Civan managed to pin Roy at 6:44, expanding the Lions’ lead.
Freshman Josh Popple brought Harvard within nine after defeating Stephen West, 5-2, but senior Bryan Panzano, who was wrestling a weight class up at 184 pounds, was pinned at 2:22, sealing the victory for Columbia.
“It was Bryan Panzano’s last match, and he went out there and fought hard and gave us everything he had,” Keith said. “It’s great for his final dual meet as a senior to end that way, and it just meant a lot to us as a team.”
Returning to the mat to compete for the first time in weeks after suffering an injury, freshman James Fox took on Nick Mills at 197 pounds.
“During practice, I really had to tell myself that I was prepared for this match because it’s tough not wrestling for four weeks,” Fox said. “All I did was ride the bike and run on the treadmill, so I felt like I might be a little out of sync...because I haven’t been on the mat in a while.”
But Fox wasted no time getting into the swing of things, as he earned the decision over Mills, 4-2.
“I feel like I did a pretty good job,” Fox said. “I did all right.”
The final match of the day saw freshman David Ng get pinned by the Lions’ co-captain Kevin Lester 24 seconds into play.
“Individually, guys going into that match needed that match to prepare for the conference championships coming up because that’s the biggest part of our season,” Fox said. “It’s just basically about us winning small battles in our matches to build up for the most important part of our season coming up. I think we had some really good matches against good kids. And I think that really helped with the momentum going into conference time.”

When the Harvard women’s basketball team faced Yale at home three weeks ago, two last-minute shots rimmed out for the Crimson in a tough loss. This time around, Harvard left nothing to chance.
The Crimson (13-10, 6-3 Ivy) jumped out to a 16-4 lead over the Bulldogs (15-9, 7-3) and never looked back on its way to a 71-51 victory.
Sophomore Christine Clark led all scorers with 23 points, her best scoring night in three weeks, in which she has recorded four 20-point outings.
“She’s pretty hard to stop on offense,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “She takes the ball hard to the basket. No matter what team we play against, they have a hard time stopping her. We can always count on her to bring intensity and always attack, and when she drives, it opens things up for everyone else. She’s a phenomenal player.”
Junior Emma Golen contributed a career-high 15 points in the Saturday night win.
“[Golen] was just a leader on the floor,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She was a director of the offense, a scorer.... It may have been her best game all year.”
Though Golen was held to single digits in five of the six last contests, Berry was confident that the junior forward was due for an outburst.
“[Golen was] having a little bit of a slump, but we knew she had it in her,” Berry said. “Sometimes I wish she was a little more selfish because she’s a great player. She had a great overall effort against Yale.”
Golen’s fellow reserve, sophomore Elle Hagedorn, tallied 11 points and nine rebounds Saturday after bringing down nine boards on Friday.
“Elle getting nine rebounds back-to-back is indescribable,” Berry said “She’s a spark for our team.”
Berry herself registered seven assists in the game, becoming the first Ivy League player ever to record 1,300 points and 500 assists in a career. Yet that milestone was only the silver lining for an otherwise sour weekend for Berry. The fourth-year starter shot 2 for 11 against Yale after shooting 2 for 16 the night before against Brown. The cold streak came just one week after Berry registered 47 points over two games.
“It’s been a little frustrating because I think of myself as a consistent player,” Berry said. “I try to take the shots that I think are appropriate during the game, but I have a ton of things I can do during the game. If the shots don’t fall, they don’t fall. It’s a little frustrating, but in the scheme of things, it’s just a shot or two…and you have to play through it.”
The Crimson didn’t need an exceptional scoring night out of Berry though, and it proved it early on. After Harvard took a commanding lead thanks in large part to Clark and Golen, Yale fought to narrow the lead down to five entering halftime, 27-22. Yet it was not able to close the gap further as the Crimson’s lead remained above five for the final 19 minutes of the game.
An and-one conversion by Hagedorn stretched the lead to nine with just over 15 minutes remaining. From there, the two rivals battled back and forth, neither able to significantly change the differential. Then, six Lippert free throws in less than a minute pushed Harvard’s advantage to 16, 56-40. The game was never close again as six more consecutive free throws helped seal the 71-51 victory. On the night, the Crimson got to the line 25 times compared to the Bulldogs’ 10.
A balanced offensive attack combined to shoot 51 percent from the field, and outside of Berry, the rest of the squad made 60 percent of its shots. At the same time, the Harvard defense held Yale to 29-percent shooting from the field and 4-of-18 shooting from deep.
That strong all-around performance came one night after a three-point loss at Brown.
“After the loss on Friday night, we were extremely disappointed,” Berry said. “It wasn’t even about Yale that night; it was about getting back to fundamental Harvard basketball and bringing intensity for the whole 40 minutes. I think Yale definitely was one of our best efforts for the season of playing together and playing with intensity for 40 minutes.”
The 20-point margin of victory is the largest for the Crimson against the Bulldogs since 1997. The win also snapped Harvard’s three-game losing streak against Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a miracle that Twitter has not exploded sometime over the past two weeks because of the Knicks' new point guard Jeremy Lin ‘10. LIN-sanity has taken over Twitter, the Internet, the NBA, and most of planet Earth. The Harvard grad and NBA sensation has become the hottest athlete on the web, garnering over one million Twitter followers in China along the way.
As you read this, Twitter is bursting with new words and puns about Jeremy “Stroking it Like a Mando” Lin.  Just check Spike Lee’s Twitter.   The world is using Twitter to spread the LIN-sanity. Here are our top 5 Jeremy Lin tweets of the week.
5) After torching the Lakers for a career high 38 points on Feb. 10, Jeremy Lin picked up some new fans.  One of those fans, Metta World Peace, happened to be on the opposing team. Lin’s high level of play prompted this tweet (and many others) from the Lakers forward:
“God created earth in 7 days, Jeremy Lin created energy in new York city in 6 games.”
4) New York Daily News opinion editor Josh Greenman didn’t need a column to share his thoughts on LIN-sanity. On Feb. 12, Greenman cited this underground study on his Twitter:
“Study: Linsanity gives Harvard grads four times the daily opportunities to casually remind everyone they went to Harvard”
The secret’s out. Now the whole world knows why Harvard students and alumni are enjoying Lin’s historic run.  Because, you know, he went to Harvard.  That’s Harvard College, where Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin got his degree. At Harvard.
3) Before Jeremy Lin there was Tim Tebow. Although Tebow-Mania has subsided, what would happen if the two combined?  Eric Stangel, Head Writer/ Executive Producer of the Late Show with David Letterman, made this prediction via Twitter:
“If Jeremy Lin got on his knee and Tebowed the world would implode... #Knicks”
Maybe this is what the Mayans had in mind when they predicted that the world would end in 2012?  After all, Harvard is being mentioned on SportsCenter and Jeremy Lin did outduel THE Kobe Bryant.  Surely those are signs of the apocalypse.
2) John Moe from St. Paul, Minnesota deserves some props for his February 10 tweet on Harvard’s success rate:
“Nice going, Jeremy Lin. It's about time someone from Harvard succeeded.”
So much for the eight Presidents, 50 something Noble Prize Winners, the various Pulitzers, 20 Supreme Court Justices, and hundreds of Congressmen.  All it took was one Jeremy Lin for international attention. Looks like someone has won himself a spot on the cover of the Harvard Admissions’ brochure.
1) After Jeremy Lin posterized Jose Calderon with a game winning three-pointer on Tuesday night, Frank Isola, the beat-writer for the New York Knicks, tweeted:
“Breaking: Winklevoss brothers from Harvard to sue Knicks. Claim they first came up with idea of Jeremy Lin.”
In just one tweet, Frank Isola referenced four things that Harvard is famous for: The Social Network, Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeremy Lin. We’re pretty sure this is Zuckerberg’s favorite Jeremy Lin tweet, making it our favorite, too. #LINning
Those are the tweets of the week. Jeremy Lin has raised his game, and so has the Tweeting world.  Hopefully, Lin will keep making a strong case for his MVP candidacy so that this golden age of Twitter continues.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in 13 years, a new Potter Cup champion was crowned, as the No. 2 Princeton men’s squash team came from behind to take the title from long-time defending champion Trinity, 5-4, Sunday night in Princeton, N.J.
The Tigers’ win was the No. 1 Bantams’ second historic loss of the year, as Trinity fell to No. 3 Yale on Jan. 18, ending a 252-game unbeaten streak. And as of Sunday afternoon, the Bantams’ run  of consecutive CSA Men’s Team Championships ended at 13. Both streaks were the longest in the history of intercollegiate athletics.
“The trend over the last few years has been increasing parity between teams,” sophomore Tommy Mullaney said. “Everybody is recruiting very aggressively and training very hard, so what used to be the Trinity juggernaut above everybody else has now given way a little bit to a whole tier of teams. On any given day, you can see any one of them pulling out a victory.”
Despite being bounced from championship contention in the national semifinals by none other than Trinity, the No. 4 Harvard men’s squash team (16-4, 5-2 Ivy) finished the weekend on a high note, earning the No. 3 spot in the nation with a victory in the consolation finals over Cornell. The mark is Harvard’s best finish in the Potter Cup since 2007.
“It’s a great step for us,” Mullaney said. “Everyone went into tournament with the goal of contending to win, and I think we did just that. [We] contended admirably and gave it a good strike. Obviously, we’re still very young team, but this weekend gave us a great foundation for us to build off of in coming years.”
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 4
In a rematch of last year’s fifth-place matchup, Harvard and No. 6 Cornell once again played to a 5-4 Crimson victory.
Although the Big Red got off to a strong start, going up, 2-1, after the first cycle, Harvard battled back, evening the score at three individual wins apiece.
“Our match against Cornell was a defining moment of weekend,” Mullaney said. “After losing a pretty crushing defeat, we got back up dusted ourselves off the next morning and gutted out a win…. It took a lot of heart from all the guys on the team.”
In the final round, sophomore Ali Farag and rookie Nick Hopcroft came up big for the Crimson, picking up wins over their Cornell opponents to secure the Harvard victory.
Sophomore Brandon McLaughlin, junior co-captain Jason Michas, and Mullaney also picked up wins for the Crimson.
The Big Red—which made it to the semifinal round following an 8-1 upset over the Yale—earned its best finish in school history, claiming fourth place overall.
TRINITY 6, HARVARD 3
Coming off of a 6-3 win over No. 5 Rochester in the opening round of the CSA Team Championships, the Crimson found itself matched up against the 13-time defending national champs in the semifinals Saturday night.
“Trinity’s steak is absolutely incredible,” Hopcroft said. “It’s a huge credit to that program and all of the players who played there. Eventually, any streak is going to come to an end, and it’s unfortunate for them that it happened this year.... All of college squash is a lot more open now.”
And for one more game, the Bantams maintained perfect form at the national tournament, clinching a spot in the Potter Cup finals after just six individual matches and eventually taking down the Crimson, 6-3.
“For Trinity, obviously we were really fired up,” Mullaney said. “It was a great atmosphere, and we gave it all we had.”
Trinity earned a 2-1 lead over Harvard after the first cycle, as sophomore Nigel Koh, who is also a Crimson business editor, notched Harvard’s first of three wins on the day.
The second cycle gave the Bantams the three remaining individual victories they needed to secure the overall win over the Crimson. Although Farag and Hopcroft captured victories at the No. 1 and No. 4 spots, respectively, the wins came after Trinity had snagged at least a second-place Potter Cup finish.
HARVARD 6, ROCHESTER 3
In its first matchup of the weekend, the Crimson came out strong and notched a win against Rochester, securing at least a fourth-place finish for the team, along with Harvard’s first opening round win since 2009.
“In our first match against Rochester, everybody got really fired up and ready to set the tone for weekend,” Mullaney said. “We knew it was going to be a really wild atmosphere and very loud and intense on the crowd side.”
The Crimson jumped out to a 3-0 lead over the Yellowjackets, with sophomore Gary Power, Koh, and Mullaney picking up early individual wins.
And thanks to second-cycle victories from freshman Tyler Olson and Michas, Harvard was able to secure a trip to the national semifinals after just six individual matches had been completed.
“We have a lot of potential on our young team,” Hopcroft said. “And we have a good chance at beating [everyone] next year…. Everyone’s really excited about where we are right now and what we can potentially do next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fresh off breaking an NCAA record for ties in a single season the night before, the Harvard men’s hockey team  suffered a loss instead on Saturday night, falling, 7-1, to Yale at a packed Ingalls Rink in New Haven, Conn.
The Bulldogs jumped out to an early 3-0 lead in the first and never looked back, earning its largest margin of victory over Harvard since another 7-1 victory back in 1998.
“[We’re] pretty disappointed,” sophomore goalie Raphael Girard said. “You can’t just show up to a game and think you’re going to win pretty easily. You win as a team, you lose as a team. Everybody made mistakes—it was just a tough game overall for us.”
The Crimson committed 15 penalties in Saturday night’s contest, leading to three Bulldog (12-13-2, 9-10-1 ECAC) power-play goals.
In its last road matchup of the regular season, Harvard (8-8-11, 6-5-9) dropped to fifth place in the ECAC standings with two games remaining. Only four points separate the current third and sixth-place teams in the league.
Harvard was able to cut the deficit to two early in the second period, as junior defenseman Danny Biega scored his eighth goal on a long wrist shot, giving him 28 points on the year, tops for defenseman in the ECAC. Biega ranks third nationally among defeseman with 1.04 points per game.
But the Crimson was not able to build much momentum after this goal, as Harvard gave up four more goals in a physical and emotional game on senior night in New Haven.
“When you’re on the road, the other team feeds off the crowd,” Girard said. “The crowd was electric down there…. It gave a lot of momentum to the opposing team.”
Yale opened the scoring 8:46 into the first, as a failed clear attempt by the visitors allowed Brian O’Neill to gather the puck and find Antoine Laganiere, who beat Crimson freshman goaltender Steve Michalek for the score.
Less than two minutes later, Bulldog forward Andrew Miller was able to redirect a Kenny Agostino pass for his sixth goal of the year.
Capping the scoring for the first frame, Agostino gave Yale the first of their three breakaway goals on the night.
“They’re a really good transition team, and we got some turnovers so they fed off that,” Girard said.
“We kind of hung our goalies out to dry a little bit,” Ford added. “And their players made some good shots and were able to get some goals.”
The Crimson has overcome leads of this size before, so the early deficit may not have been insurmountable. But after Yale quickly responded to Biega’s second period goal, it was difficult to regain momentum in front of a hostile crowd.
After killing the potent Harvard power play, the Bulldogs soon scored on another breakaway, as Charles Brocket beat the Crimson defender and sent the puck up to Kevin Limbert on the breakaway.
“After that we dug ourselves too big of a hole,” sophomore defenseman Dan Ford said. “We kind of lost a lot of momentum there.”
Despite outshooting Yale 14-9, Harvard gave up four power plays to the Bulldogs off of six penalties in the second period that hindered any momentum the team could muster.
“It was a hard-fought, physical game,” Ford said. “Some [penalties] were tough calls, some were [from] frustration. They just added up for us, and Yale took advantage.”
The Bulldogs were also able to kill a five-minute penalty after Chad Ziegler was whistled for a game misconduct for a contact to the head.
“When you kill a penalty like that, it gives you a lot of momentum,” Girard said. “We just couldn’t get any pucks bouncing our way. It was pretty frustrating.”
Yale added two late power-play goals as well, finishing off the lopsided affair.
Limbert netted his second on the night off a rebound and Anthony Day scored on a one-timer.
The Bulldogs outshot the Crimson overall, 37-26, including a 12-3 advantage in the opening frame.
Yale goalie Nick Maricic was able to stop 25 Harvard shots while Raphael Girard, who replaced Michalek midway through the second, saved 19 of 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After having its seven-game winning streak snapped on Friday night, the New York Knicks, largely thanks to another big game from Jeremy Lin ’10, bounced right back for a win on Sunday afternoon, defeating the Dallas Mavericks, 104-97.
Coming off arguably his worst performance since entering the starting lineup night, Lin played Sunday’s game like he had something to prove.  Although he still committed seven turnovers, the former Harvard co-captain recorded 28 points, a career-high 14 assists, and five steals.
“I think right now I’m being aggressive and learning a lot from my mistakes,” Lin told Metro New York after the game.  “I am trying to play the way I’m supposed to play, which is aggressive and putting pressure on defense.”
The game was full of momentum swings, and when it seemed to be getting away from the Knicks, Lin stepped up his game.  Down 70-58 with 4:17 left in the third quarter, Lin led his team on a 14-5 burst, contributing eight points.  His steal and dunk with 12.5 seconds left narrowed New York’s deficit to three, 75-72.
Even Jason Kidd, the Mavs’ point guard, seemed impressed by Lin.
“He’s a great kid,” Kidd told ESPN New York after the game. “He’s very humble, and he plays extremely hard.… He plays the game the right way.”
Lin, in his first eight starts as an NBA point guard, has scored 200 and had 76 assists. To put those numbers in perspective, Isiah Thomas had 184 points and 51 assists while Magic Johnson had 147 points and 57 assists in their first eight starts.
A number of celebrities, including Eva Longoria, Kevin Costner, and Seth Meyer, were reportedly on hand to witness Linsanity. Spike Lee, a staple at Madison Square  Garden, was sporting a No. 4 jersey from Lin’s days playing for the Crimson. Lin wasn’t the only Harvard alum in the building though, as Mark Zuckerberg also made an appearance in the stands.

Nobody expects to see books like "The Last Werewolf" and "The Emperor of all Maladies: A Biography of Cancer" sitting side by side, but these books are only two of 50 titles uploaded onto the brand new Amazon Kindles and Barnes & Noble Nooks that recently joined the Harvard Library collections.
These eReaders are part of the Harvard Library eReader Pilot Program, which allows students to check out preloaded eReaders for academic or personal use.
The program, part of the controversial Harvard Library Transition, hopes to explore ways to incorporate new technologies into the library system.
These eReaders are already wildly popular: All of the eReaders are checked out of the library, and interested students must join a substantial waitlist in order to check out a device.
Each eReader features the same collection, chosen to help alleviate the demand for the library's most popular books.
"Far and away 'The Hunger Games ' trilogy had the biggest demand," explained Rebecca H. Wingfield, Collection Development Specialist at Widener Library.
Naturally, "The Hunger Games" were uploaded to the eReaders, along with a slew of popular works and a small number of academic titles. The collection is "an eclectic, fun, and weird group," Wingfield said.
Librarians are also eager to see whether the Nook or the Kindle will be the more durable model, and the program ultimately aims to determine how students intend to use the eReaders. "We do want everyone's feedback on both the content and the devices,"  said Roseanne Sheridan, Reader Services Librarian at Lamont. "This is the only way we will know how to better expand the program."
Interested in finding out more about the available titles on the eReaders? Find the full list here.
