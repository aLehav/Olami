After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Things fall apart. That which we take for granted—as fact, as certain—has the ability to change in an instant. Yeats knew this—as did Achebe and Didion. Even The Roots I hear. Situations we perceived as fixed—a gyre, an ancestral village, certain social mores—unravel before our eyes.
I first experienced the unraveling of things—of disintegration—when my parents decided to stop loving each other. Since then, I’ve chosen to leave before the disintegration arrives. I switch schools and move cities. I stop contacting friends and cheat on lovers. The end is always easier with a cut that is sharp than one that is dull, I suppose.
I most recently experienced disintegration the fall of my sophomore year when four envelopes were slipped beneath my door. I didn’t recognize it as such at the time—disintegration is not sudden but measured; a glass of split milk on a dining room table. But I should have seen the signs. I have made it my life to see the signs. The fact that I didn’t speaks to the particular brand of falling apart that I was dealing with. Am dealing with.
And so when I found myself, months later, standing outside on Mt. Auburn telling two girl friends they couldn’t come in because they weren’t on “the list,” or—another time—when I barely followed up with the friend who drunkenly confessed that she “might have” been sexually assaulted in the upstairs bathroom, I knew I was too late. The gyre had widened and I had failed to get out in time.
~
A few weeks after the first letter arrived under my door, I stood outside of the Cambridge Tennis Club in a suit, waiting in line. This was my third event, and I knew more or less what to expect. There would be catered food. There would be a book—pages long—in which you signed your name, email, and phone number. There would or would not be alcohol. There would be a speech by the club president and its board members. There would be lots of handshakes, introductions, and formations of circles. There was, in effect, a formula, and by the fourth club I had more or less figured it out. Except—of course—why.
Here’s a game: Ask someone why they are in a club, or punching a club, and wait for the moment in which what he or she is saying starts to sound rehearsed. Disingenuous. The moment will come; it came out of my own mouth two years ago. And so what lingered among every event was a distinct sense of purposelessness—of recklessness. The stilted conversations, the imbibing, the strangers, the opulence, the myth. Distractions from the hole in the center of it all: Why are we here, why are we doing this, why are we playing this game?
~
Here’s a scene to consider: a club courtyard, loud music, a boy proclaiming the girls to be “chunky.” Here are some more: asking a girl to thank her mom for a meal she didn’t cook. A boy detailing the professions of both his parents within two minutes of meeting him. A group of girls waiting to embrace blindfolded punches at the bottom of a staircase. A dinner with a friend in which he asks me to convince my roommate to join a club. A box of Cuban cigars. The smell of money. Girls who laugh without making a sound. Boys who will laugh at anything.
~
There is, of course, the “problem” of the thing. There is the allocation of social spaces on campus, of gender and class imbalances, of social stratification and sexual assault. But this has all been said and done, underlined and italicized, to the point in which to talk about the “problem” would feel habitual, like the swallowing of a pill or the reciting of a psalm.
I’m not interested in habituals. Nor am I interested in the altar of finger-pointing. What I am interested in is the spaces between gaps, the intellectual straddling of which we are all capable. For example: I had said, numerous times, that I didn’t think I would punch. For example: Guys who I hadn’t spoken to freshman year began speaking to me sophomore fall. For example: I smiled at strangers whose names I did not know. For example: At one point I felt jealously towards my closest friend. These are the moments in which I’m interested; the clear and sudden rendering of our invisible social code.
~
In psychology, “cognitive dissonance” is defined as the mental stress experienced by an individual when holding contradicting beliefs. To avoid this stress, alteration occurs. One belief is dropped, or changed, to fit the other. The aim is consistency and cohesion: total integration. One could view my disassociation from the Spee last fall as a study in cognitive dissonance. After joining, I began to participate in the commune of intellectual aerobics to which we all prescribed. Adages of “change from within” became second-hand. The words “progressive” and “diverse” were applied liberally to the club itself. There was in all discussions an attempt to gloss over the thing; to make excuses for what we all knew at our core was somehow a social aberration. An anomaly. Then, one day in December, I decided to stop making excuses and left. Alteration occurred.
That is cognitive dissonance.
~
The night the Spee announced they were going co-ed, they held a mixer. The lights in the courtyard were turned on and the upstairs windows opened. The club’s flag flapped in the wind. A friend of mine said the place looked stately. Inviting, even. I thought it looked proud.
Days later a friend told me I would have found the deliberation to allow women into the club “hilarious.” Another disclosed that the vote was “unanimous.” There was, in each of these interactions, the distinct tone of celebration. “Look!” they wanted to say. “Progress!”
Sometimes, when I still ate meals at 76 Mt. Auburn Street, members would talk about going co-ed. People tip-toed this way and that. “We see both sides!” they said. “We shouldn’t do it now, but we should definitely be the first!” Others nodded and chewed in agreement.
On the second Friday of September the Spee became “the first.” To which I say: congrats. But to which I also say: Maybe—just maybe—you’ve missed the entire point.
~
This past year I took a leave of absence from Harvard. After hanging around LA for a little too long, I decided to hit the road for a month. I stopped and saw various friends at various colleges around the country—from Colorado to St. Louis to Ohio. I met their friends, saw their apartments and went to their parties.
I remember one particular night in which a jazz band played. The house overflowed and the floor buckled from the weight of the thing. People danced, laughed, kissed and did those other things one does at parties. It was, in all senses of the word, normal. Another Friday night.
And yet the whole thing felt entirely queer to me. There was a decided sense of communion, of camaraderie, that was unfamiliar. There were no furtive glances across the room—nobody surveyed the social latticework. People came, went, and came again, danced with and next to strangers, shared and spilt beers. There was no list, no one “at the door,” no incessant questioning of place or belonging. Because there was no need. We all participated and belonged to that same club; that easy faith in the future, that submission to the immediate, that clear eyed naiveté. Youth.
It was, unequivocally, the most fun I’d had in a long time.
~
The other day I stood on the rooftop of Felipe’s. School had just begun, and the recent closings of the clubs had turned the Mexican establishment into a refuge for the occupants of Mt. Auburn Street. People moved about, changed places, played the game. Circles formed: the Porcellian in one corner, the Spee in another, the Bee between the two, et cetera, et cetera, ad infinitum. I stood among them all—at once bemused, angry, lonely.
After hearing that I had formally left the Spee, a member of the PC suggested I should punch in the fall. He assured me that I would “love the guys” and the guys “would love” me. Most importantly, he said, it would be “the biggest 'fuck you' to the Spee.”
The biggest fuck you to the Spee. I laughed and shook my head no; he shrugged and sipped his beer and soon after that I left. Outside people walked in twos and threes and cars sped down JFK and clouds churned overhead. I walked down Mt. Auburn and entered my dorm and got in my bed and laid down. I thought about leaving again; I dreamt about cutting ties, about starting anew. I thought of these things while listening to the sounds of a party above me and shouts on the streets for friends to wait up and the din of the rooftop bar across the way until suddenly I closed my eyes and became very sleepy, and all I could feel was the world spinning beneath me, one great revolving door, that widening gyre, turning and turning on its own strange accord.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two years after the announcement of the public phase of Harvard’s capital campaign, the fundraising effort is already well on its way toward becoming the largest in the history of higher education. The University has already surpassed $6 billion in pledged support—more than 90 percent of the stated target of $6.5 billion, with three years still left before the campaign’s conclusion in 2018.
The latest report on the campaign’s progress reflects well on the University’s base of donors, and their connection to the school and its mission. At the same time, from here on out the University should focus on bolstering fundraising in areas that lag behind.
That University administrators have been able to raise such a large sum of money in so short a time speaks to their ability to make a convincing case about the importance of Harvard’s mission as a standard-bearer in higher education. By itself, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—which has raised $2.2 billion of its $2.5 billion goal—has received donations from over 60,000 individuals. Harvard students, faculty, administrators, and alumni alike should be proud that so many people feel a strong enough connection that they are willing to give monetary support to the University.
Yet the numbers obtained by The Crimson also show that not all of the campaign’s priorities are faring as well as the FAS. Though some are doing even better—the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, for example, has already raised 130 percent of its goal, due in part to the generosity of John A. Paulson—others have fallen short of expectations in comparison. Especially important is the slow progress of House renewal fundraising, which has raised less than 50 percent of its goal. The financial aid initiative, has also raised less than 65 percent of its goal, despite a $150 million donation from Kenneth C. Griffin ’89.
House renewal and financial aid may not be doing poorly in the grand scheme of things—reaching near to 50 or 65 percent of a goal before the halfway point can hardly be called a failure. They are simply overshadowed by the tremendous successes of other subdivisions of the campaign. Still, the University needs to pay special attention to equity in this campaign. One of the primary functions of the largest fundraising effort in higher education history must be to make sure the opportunities Harvard affords are more broadly available than ever before.
It is encouraging to see President Faust showing a commitment to boosting those fundraising priorities that are doing worse comparatively. Financial aid is especially important in the wake of recent reports that many schools across the country provide better for their low-income students than Harvard does.
To see such enthusiastic support from the University’s broad network of donors is heartening. As the campaign continues, it is imperative that the University not lose its focus on strengthening financial aid and other areas that provide equal opportunities. Making all students feel “fully included in the Harvard experience” is a worthy goal—and one that the Capital Campaign must not forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Donald Trump tasked the two (and a half) Hispanophones on last week’s Republican debate stage to justify their bilingualism, Marco Rubio stepped in and had the defining moment of his campaign.
Rubio told us about his conservative immigrant grandfather: a man of irreconcilable paradox to many on the left, a man of inalienable alienness to the far right, and to those few of us who aim to deploy even an iota of reason this election cycle, a man entitled to his own worldview.
His grandfather loved Ronald Reagan and America, but he expressed this love to Rubio in Spanish. It was also in Spanish that the Cuban émigré informed his grandson that by working hard, even he—the son of a bartender and a maid—could aspire to, say, one day run for president. And it’s in Spanish that Rubio relays his grandfather’s message to families like his, because the virtues of free enterprise and limited government know no lingual bounds.
Really, Rubio's grandfather could have said all this to his grandson in Elvish for all Trump should have cared—the fundamental values of our nation that Trump and his apologists ostensibly subscribe to transcend language and race. But it’s actually important for Trump that Rubio (and Jeb Bush) speak Spanish, because it allows him to continue milking his narrative of white-nationalist victimhood. Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric—calling out Bush and Trump for speaking Spanish is a fitting example—is meant to cut the whole rigmarole of fair, rational debate over illegal immigration and instead lay out the issue in racial terms that appeal to the people’s most visceral paranoia of having their country taken away from them.
We saw Trump indulge the victimist narrative of the populist fringe in another context this past weekend. In a campaign event last Friday, a man donning Trump apparel lamented to the candidate, “We have a problem in this country. It’s called Muslims. You know our current president is one...Anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That’s my question: When can we get rid of them?”
Trump’s response was risibly evasive: “We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening. We're going to be looking at that and many other things.” Cue applause. Perhaps Trump really is meant to be a politician.
A meme began circulating this weekend contrasting this encounter to John McCain’s vehement dismissal of a similar question posed to him in 2008—an interesting look at how striking a moment this is in post-millennium American politics. We were past the point when the presidential front-runner could pander to unadulterated American id and get away with it—when compassionate conservatism would give way to a vocal population of mainly well-to-do white Americans who consider themselves victims of ethnic infestation.
But then again, this makes perfect sense. Trump’s appeal to victimhood is the inevitable response to a concurrent culture of victimhood arising on the other end of the political spectrum, one that gives us microaggressions, trigger warnings, and a host of other authoritarian tools to make one population categorically in the wrong, and another categorically in the right.
Conor Friedersdorf writes in The Atlantic about a new study by sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning, who mark the advent of a “victimhood culture,” especially among young Americans. This culture encompasses people who are “intolerant of insults, even if unintentional, and react by bringing them to the attention of authorities or to the public at large.” For them, “domination is the main form of deviance, and victimization a way of attracting sympathy, so rather than emphasize either their strength or inner worth, the aggrieved emphasize their oppression and social marginalization.”
Victimhood culture departs from fundamental American values because the unyielding need for sympathy and public vengeance is not in the name of self-betterment, but of the divisive need to publicly estrange others. Fridersdorf focused on an infamous incident last year, when a Latina student from Oberlin College posted a stern open letter in response to a joke from a teammate that she found microaggressive. But perhaps a more timely example would be the recent media and political firestorm over young Ahmed Mohamed—the 14-year-old boy from Irving, Texas who rose to fame last week because he got arrested for building a clock that officials mistook as a bomb.
To be fair, Ahmed was a victim—a victim of ineptitude, courtesy of the Einsteins who work at the Irving school district and police department, too asinine too, I don’t know, call Ahmed’s parents or talk to his engineering teacher before arresting him. And once they rather quickly gathered that the clock was in fact a clock, one would think handcuffs and a one-on-five police interrogation would be superfluous. It’s easy to assume based on these facts that there were racist intentions behind these acts.
But far more plausible is the alternative that Ahmed was arrested for the same reason as the 14-year-old kid from West Virginia who wore an NRA t-shirt at school. Or for the same reason as why the six-year olds from Maryland were suspended for making “finger gun” gestures at each other. Or the seven-year-old boy from Maryland who was suspended for biting a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun. 21st-century disciplinarianism knows no skin color.
Many wanted more, however: a narrative of real victimhood, a connection between Ahmed’s arrest and something structural. Muslim Americans and their advocates used this as a platform to air their tangentially related grievances of Islamophobia and racism through hashtag campaigns and laughable polemics. A writer at The Daily Beast even wrote a piece aptly entitled “Ahmed Mohamed is the Muslim Hero America’s Been Waiting For,” a clear admission as any that Ahmed exists only to scratch an itch that the American left couldn’t quite reach until now.
Everyone likes to be a victim, and in this election cycle, it’s easy to be one. But victims exist only insofar as their victimhood does. Trump and Ahmed supporters will have their moment and relinquish the soapbox to tomorrow’s offering in the altar of grievance. What will remain timeless though is the story of Marco Rubio’s grandfather, a man greater than the narrative thrust upon him, a man to whom adversity is not a ticket to fame, but an obstacle to overcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Consuming Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” one scoop at a time, I find within the bowl a pure and raw mixture of emotion that leaves my stomach satisfied and my mind unsettled.
Reading Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” seemed like a chore—like I was handed a molcajete and a bag of fatty fruit that needed to be squashed—but in time the novel unveiled a filling appetizer that left sensual yet contrasting tastes on my tongue and fullness in my stomach. Perfected and surprisingly relatable, “Madame Bovary” was a bowl of guacamole, guiltily devoured by a lone invitee.
“Madame Bovary” is seamlessly cut into a work of realism, uniformly ripened into an experience as pure as a Hass avocado. Its flavor is not composed of extremely foreign ingredients or occurrences, but is heartily substituted with the simple creamy richness of emotion.
Emma Bovary “rejected as useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her heart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking for emotions, not landscapes." The landscape is not difficult to understand. A woman trapped by her position in society, and more so, by her own restlessness, leads to her unruly decay. It is not the unexpected that makes “Madame Bovary” satisfying, but the existence of a life smashed by daily events that are ruled by the urge to savor the uncut.
Madame Bovary’s restlessness driven with thrilling searches of passion and lust over love and security, make her a flightless bird, incapable of flying up and swallowing the fruit, rendered only able to strain and peck at the remnants of leathery skins and stems of avocado and herbs.
Chopped cilantro and chives, scallions and crushed garlic cloves—fresh details mix in to form the overall pronounced taste. Flaubert’s meticulous writing adds a subtle but decadent crunch, a necessary zing. Nature metaphors—love as “a hurricane of the skies, which falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf, and sweeps the whole heart into the abyss”; Charles as the calm open water to Emma’s roaring tidal waves provide Emma’s raw desires a sense of beauty.
The sea is universal along the shore with its rolling waves, its changing of tides—like the rhythmic smashing of avocado, the emptying of a bowl and filling of a stomach. Chef Flaubert brings a sense of unpredictability and power only to be repeated again in the next helping. With a bag of chips, the bowl of guac deepens as it was hollowed out by my own roaring stomach. Growl. Burp. Exhale. Dip. Crunch.
Acid. There are moments where I caught myself, when I was consciously aware of the sting along my cracked lips and fingertips while consuming “Madame Bovary.” Not only to be unfaithful to her husband, but also to invest in hotel visits and material items to the extent of bankruptcy. To lie and mope. To give her daughter a melancholy path she will have to face alone. Yet it is the lime juice that keeps the guacamole from browning. Madame Bovary’s acts were her undoing, her payback and final escape. She acts to feel, and she felt both passion and disaster at their upmost extremes.
But tucked away, sitting in the corner of the room alone, there are moments while obsessively scraping along the edge of the bowl when I felt terms of empathy for the considerably wretched woman. Madame Bovary lived to feel. Dissatisfied with her life, she took action rather than remaining stagnant. I understand and pity her for the imposed barriers placed on women in French society during the 19th century. Madame Bovary lacked choice, but she was a hungry pessimist exposed to temptation, and thus became blind to the outside world.
Madame Bovary takes on a self-burden of piling trinkets and hotel visits. The combined elements of an alternative world of luxury and the fantastical enchantment of running away with a lover bring a heavy weight onto her shoulders. Combined with the opposing gravity of society, Madame Bovary seeks to take one step at a time, rather look back and be appreciative of what she already has. Such straining focus destroys the temple of her peripheral vision, leaving Madame Bovary unable to see the consequences of her paved route to destruction and the heavy stares of others as they watch her go.
Her thirst becomes her madness and greed, two expansive black eyes that swallow her, two remaining seed pits of the avocados after the fat has been scraped away by a heavy, metal spoon. But perhaps she does not want to see the skewed reflection in the face of the spoon, the lone footprints in the sand; the disfigurement would only add to her internal suffering, another wrinkle to add to her aging complexion. As the journey carries on, I wonder if this is the case.
Looking into my own spoon when I am finished, I consider all I have just read, what I have just eaten. Relatable, realistic, precise. An internal mess is left to be cleaned up. The rough avocado skins of passion—will I ever feel this way? The fragmented citrus peels of mercy—shall I continue to feel a stinging guilt for my compassion? Sprinkles of appreciation, cloves of historical literary greatness.
And two avocado seeds, washed and ready to be planted in the garden of hope. Thank you for this appetizer, it was quite scrumptious.

Harvard College’s Office of Student Life has introduced a revamped system for reporting incidents of bias, which features multiple reporting avenues and the option to submit anonymously.
The changes come almost a year after more than 100 Harvard affiliates received racially charged emailed death threats, which mainly targeted women of Asian descent. These death threats spurred the redesign, according to Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College's assistant dean of student life, for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
While dela Peña said the College still wants students to speak with their tutors, proctors, and deans about incidents of bias, new initiatives like the email address reportbias@fas.harvard.edu and an online form that allows for anonymous submission create more outlets for students to report bias while enabling administrators to track data and look for trends among reports. Both the email and form are available on the OSL’s website and linked within the College’s new smartphone application.
Whereas the previous system was designed for reporting bias in the context of one-to-one interactions, the new system makes it possible for administrators to connect multiple reports referring to the same incident, like in the case of the email death threats, dela Peña added.
Along with the introduction of digital bias reporting channels, dela Peña said that the College is tentatively assembling a “bias assessment response group,” comprised of staff, faculty, and students to discuss community interventions. The group will include fewer than 12 students, and dela Peña said she has already asked the Undergraduate Council to identify representatives to serve on the committee.
In addition to the bias reporting email address, administrators created a diversity@fas.harvard.edu email address for inquiries related to “community and inclusion on campus,” along with the launch this fall of the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.  The new office will focus on first-generation, undocumented, and foster home students, and expands the number of offices focused on diversity at the College.
The changes follow the creation of two committees last spring to begin the redesign of the bias reporting system. Dela Peña added that the planning efforts included researching and visiting peer institutions.

The Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has found that Luke Z. Tang ’18, a Lowell House sophomore, died by suicide, according to spokesperson Felix Browne.
Tang, who attended high school in New Orleans before he came to Harvard, died unexpectedly on Sept. 12, and officials at first said the cause of death was pending, although they suspected no foul play.
Tang was remembered last Wednesday at a memorial service, when hundreds of students, faculty, and friends congregated in Memorial Church to honor him. At the service, friends and family shared their memories of Tang’s empathy and dedication to his friends and his faith, attributes that characterized his life.
At Harvard, Tang was a member of the Asian American Christian Fellowship and served on the board of the Harvard Interfaith Forum.
Caitlin M. Casey, the dean in Lowell House and Tang’s sophomore adviser, reflected on her relationship with Tang at the Wednesday service.
“In the short time that we knew him at Lowell, it became clear to us that Luke was a committed young man. Committed to his spiritual journey... and committed to his quest for knowledge,” she said then.

Undergraduate Council representatives voted to pass an interim budget of approximately $500,000 for the 2016 fiscal year at the first meeting of the semester that included newly elected students.
The budget’s two largest allocations include about $320,000 for student groups and $146,000 for House committee activities.
The money originates from a $75 student activity fee in each student’s term bill, according to UC treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16. The UC also receives external funding from Harvard Student Agencies and the Business School’s HBX program, which make up the operations budget.
Although this year’s fiscal budget closely resembles last year’s, the Council’s projected operations budget, which sources its funds from non-student funds, grew by $1,500, a 20 percent increase from last year. The Council also allocated $10,000 to the Freshman Class Committee, which attained committee status last semester, for expenses like study breaks and freshman programming.
According to Kanuparthy, the budget stands as an interim measure to immediately fund student groups and House committees, and changes can be made in the next two weeks.
“We don’t want this to be the final budget,” Kanuparthy said at the meeting. “After a conversation that everyone is a part of, we can move forward with a final version of the budget.”
He added that in previous years, representatives engaged in little discussion about “what the budget should look like.” The final version of the this year’s budget will be passed on Oct. 2 following further discourse among members.
As part of a new policy, the Council voted to earmark $2,500 from the $10,000 student initiatives budget to split among the four House neighborhoods—the Quad, the Square, River West, and River East—for individual neighborhood parties, which Student Initiatives Committee Co-Chair Shaiba Rather ‘17 described as “a way for people to be included.”
“We really want to set a precedent for the school year of how social life is going to look,” Rather said. “Yes, [students] have their intimate House community within the larger Harvard, but they also have other students outside of that as well.” 
In addition, Avni Nahar ’17 and Hajar El Fatihi ’17 lobbied for Council support to host an inclusive College-wide party sponsored by several women’s groups on campus. The duo said Harvard’s social scene tends to be "controlled by men," and their proposed party, which will be held at the Science Center Plaza in early October, seeks to replicate the atmosphere of House formals, as opposed to other more casual College events.
Nahar is an inactive Crimson blog editor.
At the end of Sunday’s meeting, Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17, a Crimson news writer, questioned Nasrollahzadeh and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 on their decision to fund the smartphone calendar application called “Ventfull” for an additional semester. According to Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal, the decision to allocate $1,200 in funding was made without a vote by the Council at large. Goyal added that Ventfull required immediate funds because it was used during freshman orientation week by the Class of 2019.

UPDATED: September 22, 2015, at 3:20 a.m.
Thirty-one percent of senior undergraduate females at Harvard College who responded to a sexual conduct climate survey last spring said they had experienced some form of sexual assault—what the survey termed “nonconsensual sexual contact”—during their time at the College. Sixteen percent, or 90 women, reported that they had experienced sexual penetration or attempted penetration without their consent during that time.
Results of the survey, which were released on Monday and come as the College faces an ongoing investigation into its Title IX compliance, offer an in-depth look at the climate surrounding sexual assault at Harvard, an atmosphere University President Drew G. Faust called “deeply disturbing” in an email to students, faculty, and other Harvard affiliates on Monday. 
The survey at Harvard used the term “nonconsensual sexual contact” to include three forms of nonconsensual behavior: sexual touching, attempted penetration, and completed penetration. The survey also asked whether the conduct involved physical force or incapacitation, and if alcohol was involved. In the survey, “penetration” included acts of sexual penetration “when one person puts a penis, fingers, or object inside someone else’s vagina or anus,” and acts of oral sex.
The Association of American Universities—which developed the survey and administered it at 27 schools through the research firm Westat—also reported aggregate results on Monday. Across the 27 schools, 27.2 percent of senior female undergraduate respondents reported experiencing nonconsensual sexual contact involving physical force or incapacitation since entering college. At Harvard, though, the conversation turned inward on Monday after results painted what leaders called a “troubling” picture of the sexual climate.
CRISIS AT THE COLLEGE
Last spring, Harvard and 26 other schools issued their version of a sexual assault climate survey developed by the AAU. Harvard received the highest response rate, at 53.2 percent University-wide, and 57.4 percent of undergraduates alone, compared to a 19.3 percent response rate for the AAU as a whole.
University wide, Harvard’s results fell below the AAU average. Slightly more than 4 percent of all respondents reported that they had experienced nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching since fall 2014, while the rate among all 27 AAU schools was 6.5 percent.
For undergraduates, however, Harvard’s numbers were above the AAU average. Slightly more than 29 percent of Harvard senior women—a category which includes some students in the Division of Continuing Education—reported that they had experienced nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching since coming to college. The rate was 27.2 across all 27 AAU schools. When Harvard DCE students were removed, the prevalence rate of nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching rose from 29.2 percent to 31.2 percent of Harvard respondents.
In a report to Faust, former Provost Steven E. Hyman, the chair of the Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault, wrote that alcohol is a “potent” risk factor for sexual assault. When force was a tactic reportedly used by perpetrators, more than 60 percent of surveyed respondents said the incident involved alcohol. When incapacitation was involved, more than 80 percent of surveyed students reported that the incident involved alcohol.
Hyman also noted “a relationship between social spaces and sexual assault” and urged further investigation of the issue. Of Harvard College female respondents who reported sexual assaults, more than 75 percent of the incidents reportedly occurred in dorm rooms. At least 15 percent of sexual assault incidents were reported at “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities”—the second most common reported location for sexual assault.
Economics Professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the University’s sexual assault task force who helped design the AAU survey, said that category, while generalized for all AAU universities, was tailored to encompass activity at Harvard’s single-gender final clubs.
While other groups at Harvard are single-gender—such as some singing groups—Laibson said he “would assume that most students who identify that space are thinking about final clubs.” Laibson added that the responses in the single-sex organization classification caught his attention.
“That result surprised me because I associate final clubs as non-residential spaces, and of course our students do not spend nearly as much time there as dormitories, and of course only a fraction of students have an affiliation,” he said. “That number was an alarm bell for me.”
Other figures highlighted in Hyman’s report included the differing rates of sexual assault among respondents who identify as straight and those who do not. Undergraduate students who identified in the survey as LGBAQN—lesbian, gay, bisexual, asexual, questioning, or not listed—reported experiencing sexual assault at higher rates. Among LGBAQN undergraduate females, 17.9 percent reported experiencing nonconsensual contact involving physical force or incapacitation since fall 2014; 12 percent of straight undergraduate female respondents, meanwhile, reported experiencing it during that time. For LGBAQN undergraduate males, that rate of experiencing nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching was 10.9 percent in that time, compared to 2.7 percent among their straight male peers.
According to Hyman, 73 percent of surveyed undergraduate women said they had experienced sexual harassment—a term that includes women who said others have made sexual or crude jokes and comments, offensive comments about their bodies, emailed or texted offensive sexual remarks, or repeated unwanted request for dinner, drinks, or sex. Among male undergraduates, 51 percent of respondents said they had experienced sexual harassment.
LACK OF TRUST 
As Harvard continues to face scrutiny for its handling of sexual assault from both students and federal officials investigating the College’s Title IX compliance, the spring survey results also show that student respondents lacked awareness of and confidence in Harvard’s resources for responding to sexual misconduct. Just 16 percent of female Harvard undergraduates, compared to a 37 percent AAU average, said they thought it was very or extremely likely the University would take action against offenders, according to Hyman’s report.
A majority of Harvard student respondents—71 percent—said they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct, while 8 percent said they were very or extremely knowledgeable about the process. Just 15 percent of surveyed students said they were very or extremely knowledgeable about how sexual assault and misconduct are defined at Harvard; 21 percent said they were not at all knowledgeable.
In line with previous research on the topic, the survey suggests that incidents of sexual assault go vastly underreported at Harvard. Eighty percent of female College students who reported having experienced nonconsensual penetration by incapacitation, and 69 percent of those who experienced penetration by force, did not file a formal report, according to Hyman. In the survey, Hyman wrote, “the most frequently cited reason for not reporting was a belief that it was not serious enough to report.”
The survey also revealed information about the behavior of bystanders. Fifty-four percent of surveyed Harvard students reported that had not taken any action when they had “seen or heard someone who was acting in a sexually violent or harassing way,” Hyman wrote. Of those who “witnessed a drunk person heading for a sexual encounter,” 80 percent said they did not take action.
Thirty-two percent of female undergraduates said sexual assault or misconduct is very much or extremely problematic at Harvard, while 19 percent of male undergraduates said the same.
NEXT STEPS
In campus communications and a town hall forum on Monday night, officials balanced questions about the survey with pledges of future action.
Observers on Monday and questioners at the forum also highlighted potential oversights in the survey that may factor into future steps. Laibson acknowledged that the survey, for instance, did not in his mind offer usable data that would allow officials to normalize for a larger population the prevalence of sexual assault in final clubs, nor did it ask about locations where actions leading up to reported assaults may have occurred.
Hyman will send Faust his task force’s final report in January 2016, and he wrote Monday that those recommendations will build on changes that have already been made, including increased funding to the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and an online web port, SHARE, that offers resources to victims.
Hyman was adamant, though, that much work remains to be done.
“[A]s we have learned from our work, and most notably from the survey, these and other initial actions fall far short of what will prove necessary,” he wrote. “Based on the high prevalence of assault and other forms of sexual misconduct, it is clear that the University must achieve inclusive and authentic engagement of our students, and indeed the entire community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the beginning of Ivy League play and the main spring season still several months away, spectators who are following the Harvard men’s tennis team might come to wonder why the team has such a busy schedule this fall.
The reason, however, is clear to Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72.
“This [time of year] is critical for these guys to define what their game style is,” Fish said. “It’s like a hockey team understanding what its power play is like.”
So to help his players discover their “power play,” Fish sent them to two separate tournaments this past weekend.
Of the 13 on the roster, four were at Yale for the Connecticut State Championships, while seven made the trip down to Princeton for the Ivy Plus Tournament. Two other players, junior Sebastian Beltrame and sophomore Kenny Tao, were sidelined with minor injures, but should be back on the court as early as next week, according to Fish.
The players who did suit up had a successful weekend. Senior Kelvin Lam turned his hard work during the offseason into immediate results, showing his growth as a singles player at the Ivy Plus Tournament. Despite a loss earlier in the weekend, he looked at the top of his game on Sunday as he battled Anthony Arocho from Brown late in the consolation bracket.
Another player who made a ripple in the tournament was freshman Andy Zhou. Despite having played competitive college tennis for only two weeks, Zhou took down highly-ranked Kial Kaiser from Princeton in straight sets, 6-4, 6-0, and advanced deep into his bracket. Fish praised Zhou’s performance, pointing out that his “firepower” and “instinct” in particular will be welcome additions to the team.
Sophomores Jean Thirouin, who celebrated his birthday in Princeton during the tournament, and Grant Solomon, also put in commendable performances.
Junior Brian Yeung was upbeat about the chance to face tough competition so early in the fall, noting that “most of the best players from the Ivy League schools, and from a few others from around the country,” were in the draw.
The level of competition speaks to the growth of the Ivy Plus Tournament itself, which just started in 2013. This year’s edition, however, attracted schools as far from the Northeast as Indiana, Tennessee, and Miami (Fla.). Overall, 128 players were in the draw from the 23 schools in attendance. The tournament had eight brackets, composed of 16 players each, and games took place from Friday through Sunday.
Meanwhile, a few hours north in New Haven, Conn., matches were also taking place all weekend at the Connecticut State Championships. In an event that has historically only included players from Connecticut, Marist and Harvard received and accepted invitations this year. Eight schools overall made up the field at this tournament, which was more of a regional affair.
Assistant Head Coach Andrew Ruebb ’95 brought four players from Harvard to Yale, including three freshmen who are still adjusting to the level of the college game.
Next weekend, the whole team will be back together for a trip to College Station, Texas, for a large, national tournament on the campus of Texas A&M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (3-2) recorded two consecutive shutout triumphs over the weekend, winning 1-0 against Northeastern (2-6) and 3-0 against Colgate (0-8). These games are the last before the Crimson readies to play their first Ivy League contest of the year against Yale.
HARVARD 3, COLGATE 0
The Crimson amped-up their offense in its game against Colgate by outshooting the Raiders 32-3. Jacobson continued to score goals for Harvard, racking two to her name as well as assisting on the only other goal. Jacobson also only needed 82 seconds before finding the back of the Colgate net.
Junior forward Marissa Balleza continued on her victory streak, slotting in her fifth goal of the year. At the 8:59 time mark, Balleza tipped in the ball after an assist from Jacobson. This goal being Balleza’s 26th goal in less than three seasons, she moves up into seventh place on the career scoring list for the Crimson. She was joined on the scoreboard by freshman forward Kathleen Young, which was Young’s second career goal of the season.
HARVARD 1, NORTHEASTERN 0
Harvard broke the stalemate against the Huskies late in the first half with a goal from back and co-captain Elizabeth Jacobson. Jacobson scored the only goal of the match after stealing the ball from a Northeastern player right in front of the net in the 33rd minute. The goal was also Jacobson’s second of the season.
The Crimson was not only active on offense but also on the defense end. Senior goalkeeper Issy Davies blocked six shots in her second career shut out and first shutout of the year. On offense, Harvard had twice as many shots on goal as their Husky opponents with 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two early Massachusetts goals doomed the Harvard women’s soccer team, as the Crimson left Amherst with a 2-0 defeat late Sunday afternoon. The two scores came last than a minute apart and provided the only offense UMass would need against a Harvard offense that only registered three shots on goal.
The Minutemen (3-3-2) extended their win streak to three while the Crimson’s scoring woes continued, as it was the fourth time Harvard (2-5-1) has been shut out in a loss this season.
Forward Alyssa Fratarcangeli got UMass on the board in the game’s 18th minute, and midfielders Daniela Alvarez and Julia Weithofer picked up assists. Fifty-five seconds later, the Minutemen doubled their lead when junior forward Megan Burke beat Crimson freshman goalkeeper Danielle Etzel for her second tally of the year.
UMass was able to maintain the offensive intensity it has been playing with of late. After tallying only one goal in its first five games, the Minutemen have scored six in its last three contests.
The UMass defense has been equally as impressive during the stretch. The team has not allowed a goal since Sept. 6 against Yale, a scoreless streak that has reached almost 263 minutes. It was the last nonconference game before Atlantic 10 play begins for the Minutemen a week from Thursday. UMass posted a 2-1 record in its three matches against Ivy League opponents.
Harvard was unable to penetrate the Minutemen’s defense and was held in check for most of the game. Despite scoring two goals against New Hampshire on Thursday, the Crimson has only tallied three goals in its last six games. Junior forward Midge Purce, the team leader in goals after scoring her second goal of the campaign on Thursday, led the Harvard offensive attack with four shots, including one on goal. Sophomore midfielder Dani Stollar and senior forward Emily Mosbacher managed Harvard’s other two shots on net.
The contest was the Crimson’s fourth-consecutive road loss and was the team’s final road nonconference game before opening up Ivy League play.
Once again, Harvard was able to utilize its depth against UMass, but it ultimately did not result in any goals. Nineteen different players logged minutes for the Crimson, including Etzel, who was making her first career start for Harvard. The freshman made two saves in what was her second collegiate appearance. Junior defender Bailey Gray and Stollar were the only other Crimson players to play the entire game.
For Harvard coach Ray Leone, it was the first time one of his teams has lost to the Minutemen. Leone had been 3-0-1, including a 2-0 mark in Amherst, against UMass entering Sunday. It was also the first time the Minutemen have defeated the Crimson since January of 1995.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s volleyball team might have found its groove at the right time.
After starting the season with just two wins in its first seven games and the start of conference play looming, the Crimson (4-6) took two of three matches at this weekend’s New England Challenge, pulling out 3-1 wins over Connecticut (6-5) and Northeastern (3-12) before falling in the tournament’s finale to Boston College (8-4) in five sets.
Hosting the event at the Malkin Athletic Center, Harvard was led by the play of junior Corie Bain—who averaged a triple double over the weekend—and rookie middle blocker Christina Cornelius, who impacted both sides of the game, averaging a .350 hitting percentage and 1.69 blocks per set. Both players were named to the All-Tournament team for their efforts.
“Overall we played pretty well,” co-captain Hannah Schmidt said. “We definitely are still striving to work on a couple things, and I think we did a good job getting those things figured out throughout the tournament. We looked ready to start playing Ivy League teams.”
BOSTON COLLEGE 3, HARVARD 2
The Crimson entered the fourth set of the weekend’s final contest with a 2-1 lead, giving Harvard a chance to ride a weekend sweep into the start of Ivy League play. But the Eagles had different plans.
After holding the lead for most of the fourth set, BC was able to hold off a late rush from the Crimson, who rallied for four straight points late in the set to tie the frame at 22 points apiece. But kills from seniors Katty Workman and Kam McLain helped the Eagles force a tiebreaking set.
Workman continued her success on the attack in the fifth set, tallying three of her team’s four final kills to break a 10-10 tie and bring home the concluding game of the tournament for BC.
Cornelius helped push Harvard to an early lead, notching a team-high 17 kills while also recording seven blocks.
“[Cornelius] did awesome,” Schmidt said. “She played a lot of positions [this weekend] which shows how versatile she is and how she can really play all aspects of the game.”
Bain led the team with 31 assists and 20 digs—falling one kill short of her third consecutive triple-double—finishing the weekend with a triple-double average of 26 assists per game, 13 kills per game, and 15 digs per game.
HARVARD 3, NORTHEASTERN 1
After the Huskies stole the second set of their matchup with Harvard, the Crimson made sure not to let it happen again.
After taking the third set rather easily—the team had a 13-point lead late in the stanza—Harvard make quick work of Northeastern in the fourth set, 25-21, to come away with a four-set win after stumbling slightly in the second frame.
The Crimson played without the help of junior outside hitter Grace Weghorst and senior outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, forcing underclassmen into key roles. But that did not slow down Harvard.
“We’re making a lot of different lineup adjustments,” Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We have a couple injuries that we’re working around. I think there are some athletes that are stepping up and getting the job done.”
Freshman middle blocker Jocelyn Meyer and sophomore outside hitter Heather Sigurdson saw extensive playing time in their second and first games, respectively. Sigurdson recorded eight digs in her debut with the team.
The debutants weren’t by themselves, however, as the experience and leadership of regulars such as Bain, Schmidt and co-captain Caroline Holte kept the team rolling.
“It’s great to see...Corie, Caroline, and Hannah stepping up to the plate and keeping the chemistry going,” Weiss said.
HARVARD 3, CONNECTICUT 1
After dropping the first set of its tournament opener, the Crimson found itself in danger of going down two sets, trailing 23-19. But with the help of three kills from sophomore Paige Kebe, the Crimson fought back, winning seven of the next eight points to tie the game at one set a piece.
The Crimson would hold on to the momentum from that set, winning the next two frames by a combined margin of seven points and taking the first game of the tournament.
Cornelius anchored the Crimson defense at the net with seven blocks. Senior libero Sindhu Vegesena added a team-high 23 digs in the tournament’s opening contest, finishing the weekend with 55 digs in the team’s last tuneup before beginning conference play with a tilt against Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard coach Ted Minnis paced up and down the side of the pool, barking orders and play calls to his starting six.
In his sixth season at the helm, Coach Minnis understood the importance of Harvard vs MIT men’s water polo games better than anyone on his team. His efforts were ultimately rewarded as the Crimson capped off a successful weekend with a convincing 15-9 win over its crosstown rival.
After losing a close game to No. 13 Brown (8-3) on Saturday, Harvard (4-5) responded with dominant wins over Connecticut College (0-3) on Saturday night and MIT (3-3) on Sunday.
“It’s a rivalry game,” Minnis said. “MIT and us; since I got here, it has been a battle back and forth…. It’s all about getting better. We took a big step against Brown. To come out and keep that momentum up, and play at that intensity and that level was huge in this game against MIT.”
HARVARD 15, MIT 9
Harvard came out of the gates strong against MIT, jumping out to a 9-1 lead midway through the second quarter. The Crimson was led by the commanding presence of co-captain Ben Zepfel, who drew five kickouts and scored four goals.
Zepfel also managed to influence the game beyond what appears on the stat sheet, opening up space for the likes of junior defender Dan Stevens and senior attacker Blake Lee, who scored four and two goals respectively.
“[Zepfel is] a beast,” Minnis said. “There’s a reason people have to worry about him on defense. He’s explosive, he’s got great hands, he’s got great vision, and he just commands a lot of attention.”
The Harvard defense was troubled throughout the day by MIT senior Kale Rogers, who scored MIT’s first six goals of the game.
He could have had even more, but Crimson senior goalkeeper Colin Woolway stood on his head to deny Rogers from inflicting any further damage, making a couple of crucial one-on-one stops to maintain Harvard’s momentum.
“[Woolway] had 15 saves,” Minnis said. “He came up huge, played his best game of the year.”
A period of relaxed Harvard defending after halftime allowed MIT to creep back into the game, as the Engineers cut the lead to 10-5 midway through the third quarter—the closest the visitors would get from that point on.
Zepfel was there to stop the bleeding, scoring two goals 25 seconds apart to extend his side’s lead. MIT ended the game on a miniature run of its own, scoring three of the last four goals, but it was too late for the Engineers to do any serious damage to the Crimson defense.
HARVARD 17, CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 5
After dropping its first game of the weekend, the Crimson came back to route the Camels, picking up its first CWPA Northern Division win in the process.
Harvard raced to a 17-5 win over Connecticut College, as junior Viktor Wrobel recorded a team-high three goals. The Crimson received contributions from many sources, with 12 different players finding the back of the net on a night when the offense was firing on all cylinders.
Woolway and classmate Connor Denney split time in between the sticks, combining to allow a season-low five goals.
BROWN 10, HARVARD 9
The first game of the day on Saturday proved to be an instant classic, with Harvard dropped, 10-9, in overtime to Brown.
After being down 5-2 at the half, the Crimson made a furious comeback in the third quarter—led by a hat trick from senior attacker Noah Harrison—to tie the game at seven apiece.
While the Bears seized a 9-8 lead with 45 seconds left, senior Blake Lee’s 7-meter backhand with time expiring tied the game up at nine, forcing it into overtime.
Harvard was unable to score in the extra frame, however, as a deflected shot got past Woolway in the dying moments of overtime to seal a Brown victory.

With about 12 minutes left in the first half, Harvard sophomore Maya Learned made a break to the right of a scrum the Crimson had just won. She broke through two Yale defenders and beat another three to extend the hosts’ lead to 44.
Fifty-two minutes and 65 points later, Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) left Cumnock Field on Saturday with a dominant 109-5 win in its Ivy opener and a program single-game team point record in tow.
Harvard set the pace early with three tries within the first five minutes of the match and continued to apply pressure throughout. After building up 10 tries and a 56-0 lead in the first half, the hosts added another nine tries in the second half to break the previous team scoring mark of 105.
The Crimson’s youth carried the day. Freshmen Caitlin Wiegel and Sarah Lipson recorded a game-high three tries apiece. Harvard also scored off of three downfield kicks from freshman Susie Clements, who finished the day with a try and seven conversions for 19 points.
“I think this game allowed our younger players to settle in a little bit,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “Today was a great opportunity for them to really get in sync with each other.”
In all, 14 Harvard players recorded points. The Crimson’s final try, scored by sophomore Haley Langan, passed the former team points mark, set in Harvard’s inaugural varsity season against Boston College on March 29, 2014.
Despite losing nine of 15 scrums, Harvard forced Bulldog turnovers and controlled possession in commanding fashion. The Crimson won all four line outs during the match.
The Bulldogs scored their only try of the game with 10 minutes remaining. Sunday marked the first time Yale has scored against a varsity Harvard team. Yale remains a club team.
“[The game] was exciting because we really didn’t know what to expect from Yale,” Clements said. “We wanted to just come out with a lot of intensity, and it was just really satisfying because I think we executed quite well a lot of times.”
For Harvard, the game was about more than pure offense, as the team made crucial tackles to prevent the Bulldogs from scoring throughout most of the game.
With the score at 87-0 in the second half and Yale threatening at the line, the Crimson held off the Bulldogs for a full five minutes, forcing three scrums before finally kicking the ball back and later scoring off a scrum.
“For us, that was one of the two really big tests of our defense in the game, and it was really helpful for us to get some of those defensive line stands,” said co-captain Hope Schwartz, a former Crimson sports editor. “In the first one when we did shut them down, I think we were just really disciplined about staying in front of the ball. We were really disciplined about getting low on our tackles and making positive tackles.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HOSCH STARTS HOT
KINGSTON, R.I.—Over the month-long course of the preseason, senior quarterback Scott Hosch withstood a trial of scrutiny and second-guessing.
Despite starting and winning six of Harvard’s 10 games last season, Hosch faced quarterback competition from junior Joe Viviano in what coach Tim Murphy publicly characterized as an “even” battle.
Last week, when Murphy announced that Viviano had suffered a season-ending foot injury, suspicion took on a new form, as questions arose about whether the less mobile Hosch could match Viviano’s athleticism.
Well one of the cleanest aspects of any season opener is how quickly pregame headlines disappear. In Hosch’s case, it took just a quarter of near-flawless football to ease up initial concerns.
“The bottom line is, Scotty made very good decisions,” Murphy said. “We got very good protection, and I think later on it gave us some very good opportunities to run the football.”
In the first 15 minutes, the senior led two touchdown drives, going 9-for-11 for 154 yards. He completed the first six passes that he threw and opened the game by taking the Crimson 78 yards down the field in less than four minutes.
Many of these yards came on short tosses. Harvard dialed up five throws on its first drive, and with the exception of a down-and-out touchdown to junior tight end Ryan Halvorson, all these completions went for less than 10 yards.
“I wanted to take what they gave us at the start,” Hosch said. “We had a couple of big plays, but [there were] tight windows the whole game… I had to find the fourth and fifth guy in the progression starting early.
Hosch’s success contrasted with the early performance of Rhode Island quarterback Paul Mroz, who started 0-for-5. That streak ended when Mroz found freshman wide receiver Khayri Denny on a 62-yard crossing route early in the second quarter.
As Mroz heated up—he finished the half 6-of-14—Hosch cooled off, throwing his first interception of the season into tight third-down coverage.
Still, Hosch rode his huge first quarter to a record-setting performance, notching a career-best 336 passing yards and three touchdowns through the air.
LESS THAN AN A FOR THE D-LINE
With close to 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter, Harvard’s defensive line faced its first major test of the season.
The score stood at 14-7, the ball stood on the Crimson’s 41-yard line, and the Rams stood in power formation, hoping to cram the ball two yards forward to complete a drive-deciding fourth down.
They never got a chance. Before the ball could be snapped, the referee blew his whistle as a Harvard player jumped the line. First down, Rhode Island.
Though the Crimson produced a stop on the next set of downs, that fourth-down play stood out on an afternoon when the Harvard defensive line struggled to control the ground game. Rams running back Harold Cooper earned 95 yards on 22 carries, and Rhode Island tallied 135 rushing yards, more than it had gained in its previous two games combined.
“I thought the running back was a great back,” said captain and linebacker Matt Koran. “He was very shifty—made us miss a lot—so we’re going to have to work on the fundamentals next week.”
At the start of the preseason, the Crimson faced questions about how it would fill the 520-pound hole left by graduates Zack Hodges and Obum Obukwelu, a pair of All-Ivy defensive linemen. On Saturday, Harvard addressed this concern by shuffling through various rotations of players.
Yet this defense-by-committee approach did not limit Cooper. In the Rams’ season opener against Syracuse, the sophomore back rushed eight times only to lose one yard, but he found redemption against the Crimson defense, averaging 4.3 yards per carry.
NEW FACES MAKE IMPACT
Heading into Saturday, senior quarterback Jimmy Meyer had never thrown a pass in a college game. Neither had freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley caught one.
All this changed with 7:16 left in the game. With Harvard controlling a 35-10 lead, Meyer dropped back to pass, and Shelton-Mosley took off down the left sideline.
A few seconds later, the precedential moment dropped into place. Meyer lofted the ball towards the pylon, and Shelton-Mosley hauled in the 37-yard strike to complete the rare first-pass, first-catch combination.
Admittedly the two players arrived at the moment from different places. Meyer is a senior play-caller who had taken snaps in four different games, although he had never thrown a pass. Slated to be a third-stringer, Meyer rose to the backup position after Viviano’s injury.
“He’s worked really hard in his four years here, and he’s brought it every year in fall camp,” Hosch said. “Just to see him have a chance to get in there and make a play like that, I was fired up.”
Meanwhile Shelton-Mosley, a true freshman, was making his first trip with the team. A West Coast recruit who had entertained offers from California, Washington, and Duke before committing to the Crimson, Shelton-Mosley arrived on campus with hushed but insistent expectations, especially after College Sports Madness named him its preseason pick for National Freshman of the Year.
For at least one play on Saturday, he showed a flash of that potential—and, in a converse way, so did the veteran Meyer.
“Everywhere we are, we have weapons,” Hosch said. “Every single guy can make a play, even the backups. Those guys are making plays too.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Crimson sophomores emerged victorious from their singles brackets as the Harvard women’s tennis team opened its 2015 fall season at the annual Harvard Fall Classic within the confines of the Beren Tennis Center.
The Crimson and six other East Coast teams—Boston College, Boston University, Columbia, Connecticut, Wake Forest, and Yale—competed in four singles brackets and two doubles brackets. By the end of the weekend, Harvard second-years Annika Ringblom and Ellen Jang-Milsten finished atop their respective singles brackets.
“I thought it was a very exciting first home tournament for our squad,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We have a very young squad, and it was great to see the players back in action.”
On Sunday, Ringblom bested Wake Forest freshman Emma Davis for the singles green championship, while Jang-Milsten ousted Wake Forest junior Luisa Fernandez for the singles blue title.
Ringblom cemented her place in the championship game with consecutive three-set victories. In the semifinals, the sophomore defeated junior Samantha Asch of Wake Forest in three sets, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Prior to that, she fought back against Yale freshman Amy Yang after losing the first set, 2-6, to take her first match.
As for Jang-Milsten, the sophomore rolled past Demon Deacons senior Xue Zhang on Saturday, 6-2, 6-0, after receiving a first-round bye on Friday. Later that day, she edged Wake Forest senior Andrea Retolaza Andrade in a three-set nail-biter, 4-6, 6-2, 7-6 (4).
Including Ringblom and Jang-Milsten, Harvard found itself heading into Sunday with players in three of the four singles championships and one of the two doubles championships. While the spring season is team-oriented, singles players and doubles pairs typically enter as individuals during the fall.
The weekend also offered the first match action for two Crimson rookies. Freshman Erica Oosterhout reached the final match of the singles red bracket, where she fell to BC junior Lexi Borr, while classmate Isabel Jasper, paired with Jang-Milsten, made it to the Doubles B division championship match.
“We had two freshmen that did a very good job for us this weekend here,” Green said. “Both of them competed really well this weekend, and we got to see some things they need to work on as well as some things they do really well.”
On Friday, Oosterhout opened her invitational by dismantling Connecticut senior Srna Stosljevic in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. Then on the second day of the tournament, she faced off against Demon Deacons junior Kimmy Guerin and handily won her match, 6-2, 6-3, to reach the final.
Meanwhile, Jasper and Jang-Milsten reached the championship match by besting BU’s Iris Lin and Kate Semashka, 8-7 (5), and Columbia’s Nada Zaher and Lindsey Mendelson, 8-4.
“I think it was a good first tournament,” Jang-Milsten said. “I think a lot of us haven’t played matches in a while, so it was good to get out here and play matches against different teams. It was also good because Columbia and Yale are here, and we’ll be playing them a lot; it was fun to see them, fun to play against them.”
Elsewhere in individual play, Crimson sophomore Nikki Kallenberg defeated BU senior Lauren Davis, 6-3, 6-2, in her opening match before falling to Borr in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.
In addition to her doubles title, Jasper also came away with a win in her first individual match of the weekend over BU freshman Kaely Malik. However, she conceded her next match against the Bulldogs due to injury.
In doubles, the duo of Ringblom and Oosterhout defeated the Terriers’ Iryna Kostirko and Remi Ramos, 8-4, in the A bracket but lost its next match against BC’s Katya Vasilyev and Emily Safron, 4-8. Another Eagles pair, Wan-Yi Sweeting and Asiya Dair, defeated Kallenberg and captain Amy He, 8-3, in the Doubles B division.

Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig is running for the Democratic Party’s nomination in the 2016 United States presidential election. But why should Lessig be the only one at Harvard to experience all the fun of campaign season? Flyby wants to spread the love, so we’ve brainstormed potential campaign platforms and strategies that we are pitching to other Harvard professors. Who would you cast your vote for?

Robert A. Lue
In the spirit of stress reduction, all Americans will be able to file their taxes over the course of six short forms as opposed to the former long forms. Also don’t worry about the IRS coming after you. Everyone is entitled to one “oops” moment if a form is completed incorrectly (see: fraudulently) because everyone has an off day sometimes.

Michael J. Sandel
You could vote for Sandel, but should you? What will it say about your character, what you value in life, the type of person you aspire to be? Sandel’s platform will not be quite clear. He will not spend much time lecturing you about his platform or dreams for the country. In fact, he will let your peers do most of the talking. And do you really want the socially awkward science concentrator who is just trying to fulfill his Ethical Reasoning Gen Ed dictating the direction the country takes in the next four years?

David Malan
You might as well vote for Malan, because everyone else is doing it. Plus, I hear he gives out free “This is My Campaign” t-shirts and USA swag at the end of his first term! Malan’s platform mainly centers on the elimination of the Common Core in favor of required CS50 for all. He also wants to get rid of the USA’s antiquated judicial system in favor of a “regret policy.” It is okay to commit a crime, as long as you come forward to Malan or one of his staff. Also, he will likely get really tough on the country after the first 100 days. Just warning you.

N. Gregory Mankiw
In the interest of simplifying the tax code, everyone will just pay their taxes directly to Greg Mankiw. The next President will inherit a White House complete with a custom “Ec 10” Air Force One, and a bed literally made out of money. And on the bright side for those of you who do not vote for Mankiw, it will not actually be him running the country most of the time. Instead, he’ll invite his VP and Cabinet members into the Oval Office to be “guest Presidents.”

If you’re starting to wonder whether that fourth problem set class was a good idea or not, today would be the day to decide. It’s the deadline for adding or dropping classes without incurring a fee today, so after midnight tonight you’ll need instructor permission to add a course, and you’ll be charged $10 each day a submission is made to your study card.
That’s $10 that could just as easily go to a Super Burrito at Felipe’s. With chips. And guac. REAL AVOCADO, people.
So if you need to make a change, get cracking. Your 1:30 a.m. stomach will thank you.
P.S. Fifth Monday is on October 5th, which is the last day undergrads can add/drop a course or change a class from letter-grade to pass/fail or vice versa.

Somehow, with his busy schedule, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has apparently found time to comment on Crimson stories online, offering thoughts on the undergraduate social scene under a Disqus account in his name.
Or, you know, perhaps it’s an imposter. Shocking as it is that some people use the internet to deceive others, we at Flyby hope that the real Dean Khurana would be funnier, were he to weigh in on campus happenings in our comment section, and so must assume that it is not in fact the dean.
So while the real Rakesh Khurana has tried to affect the College’s social scene through conversations with final club graduate board leaders and otherwise questioning the groups’ practices, another “Rakesh Khurana” has declared other plans to Crimson comment section readers. (He will soon be “raiding all non-CoEd clubs' second rounds with my SJWAT team,” according to one post. “Look out grad boards!” the supposed Khurana imposter wrote.)
On this capital campaign story, the “dean” requested a “few million or so” for a “community values-enforcement squadron, answerable only to me.” The likely imposter also revealed a new punishment for parties held in freshman dorm rooms: “Off to the gulag with you and your blockmates!”
