After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rather than create a college rating system as it had originally proposed, the U.S. Department of Education now plans to release a data tool for prospective students and their families to compare colleges this summer.
The federal rating system, a version of a system proposed by President Barack Obama two years ago and further detailed in a draft report late last year, would have involved rating colleges based on factors including graduation rates, post-college debt and earnings, and average net price. After the draft prompted some pushback, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that the Education Department was considering revising its proposal into a two-part system.
The Department of Education detailed plans last week for a different system of evaluating colleges, a data tool it says will offer students and families a way to compare college costs and outcomes without an explicit government ranking or rating. Unlike the previously proposed federal rating system, consumers, rather than the government, will formally evaluate schools under the tool.
A post on the Education Department’s blog detailing the new system billed it as a “college ratings tool” that will “take a more consumer-driven approach than some have expected, providing information to help students to reach their own conclusions about a college’s value.” Officials will also release open data to researchers and other institutions to “help others benchmark institutional performance.”
The Obama Administration has already released a college grading tool in the form of its “College Scorecard.” Housed on the White House website, the searchable tool contains information about colleges including graduation rate, average net price, and loan default rate.
Many leaders in higher education, including Harvard President Drew G. Faust, have raised concerns about the concept of a federal college ranking or rating system since government officials began discussing it. 
“One of the general and widespread responses in higher education to [the rankings system] proposal has focused on what are we trying to measure and how [we] understand what a good education is,” Faust said in 2013. “And some of the kinds of criteria that have been identified are quite troubling to many of us.”
According to Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, the tool that officials are now discussing may better capture the nuances of assessing colleges.
“What we won’t be getting is an obvious U.S. News and World Report replacement system,” Lake said, referring to the publication’s annual college rankings. “The department now realizes that any system of evaluation of higher [education] is more multifaceted than they may have originally conceived.”
Lake predicted that once the tool is unveiled, Harvard will do its best to “win” under the new system. “You can bet that someone will be looking at each and every data point, trying to figure out how to improve that,” he said.
But for now, Lake said, it is difficult to predict the proposed tool’s effects. Describing the tool as in a “wait-and-see mode,” Lake said, “The administration right now hasn’t really committed to something entirely clear, so it’s hard to be clear about what the outcome will be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patrick McNally is on his way to San Jose.
The former Harvard defenseman has signed a two-year entry level contract with the NHL’s San Jose Sharks, following goaltender Steve Michalek and forward Brian Hart as the third Harvard hockey player to ink a professional contract this week.
The Sharks announced Thursday that McNally had agreed to a two-year entry-level contract, five days after the team acquired the rights to sign him in a draft-day trade with the Vancouver Canucks.
“Patrick is a player we have had our eye on for some time now,” Sharks general manager Doug Wilson said Thursday, according to the team’s website. “He had been a very productive collegiate defenseman and head coach Ted Donato and the Harvard staff have done a tremendous job preparing him to take the next step. We’re excited for him to continue his development with our organization.”
For McNally, who averaged a point per game over an injury-shortened season and helped lead Harvard to its first ECAC championship since 2006 this year, the deal came as a relief. The all-conference tournament defenseman entered the offseason uncertain of where he would play next.
“It feels good,” McNally said of the deal. “It’s a relief after being up in the air for so long [and] not really knowing what was going to happen, so it feels good to have it under my belt and know what I’m doing and have a plan.”
After he withdrew from the College in his sophomore year alongside teammates Michalek and Max Everson in the wake of the Gov 1310 cheating investigation, the NCAA denied the three players’ waivers for additional years of intercollegiate eligibility in early June. Weeks later, Canucks general manager Jim Benning said that the team would not sign the Glen Head, N.Y., native. On the second day of the NHL Entry Draft last weekend, Vancouver dealt McNally’s signing rights to San Jose in exchange for a seventh-round pick.
“The trade came as a bit of a surprise to me, but when it happened I talked to a couple of guys from San Jose, and my agent thought it was a good fit,” said McNally, who is currently taking two summer classes at Harvard and plans to complete his degree in August. “They seemed like they were excited to have me, so it kind of moved quickly after that.”
McNally’s signing capped a busy signing week for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Michalek signed a two-year entry level deal with the Minnesota Wild on Wednesday while Hart agreed to a three-year, two-way deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning on Sunday.
Michalek started in every game for Harvard last season and set a single-game tournament saves record in the Beanpot. Hart, meanwhile, ranked sixth among Harvard skaters in goals (7) last season and registered 17 points in 37 games.
"It just seemed like the right timing and everything, with my development,'' Hart told the Syracuse Post Standard on Thursday. "I'm looking forward to a new chapter in my life.''
McNally hopes to attend the Sharks’ prospect development camp next week. He will likely play his first regular season pro games next fall with the Sharks or their American Hockey League affiliate, the newly-branded San Jose Barracuda. Regardless of where he plays, McNally feels prepared to prove himself on a new stage.
“Right now I’m just focusing on getting ready for development camp and doing the best I can there and going in and working hard.” McNally said. “Wherever I am, I just want to play my best…. I’m new to professional hockey, so I’m not going to make any bold statements. We’ll see what happens.”
