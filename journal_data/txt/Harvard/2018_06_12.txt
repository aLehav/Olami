After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was 2003, and Radiohead didn’t need another pristine masterpiece. They needed to express outrage, and they outdid themselves in this regard with their messy sixth album “Hail to the Thief,” which celebrated its fifteenth anniversary on June 9th.
The most political Radiohead album ever, “Hail to the Thief” brandishes anger at the unjust wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the disputed election of former president George W. Bush (the “thief” being ironically hailed in the album’s title), the rise of right-wing politics in the United States and the United Kingdom, the complacency of their citizens, and the perils of fame. 15 years and three albums later, “Hail to the Thief” is still Radiohead’s angriest and most unbridled record. Simultaneously a mutter and sing-song, strained and explosive, electronic and a return to a guitar-driven rock core, “Hail to the Thief” embodies the frustration and defeat of a bruised animal throwing itself against the bars of a cage—“hysterical and useless,” to quote the band’s earlier work (“let down”). It is a bleak internalization of current events, with its frankness made apparent by its reluctance to offer encouragement, solutions, or anything remotely anthemic.
Following the supernatural electronica of “Kid A” (2000) and the spooky grooves of “Amnesiac” (2001), Radiohead went down a messier path for “Hail to the Thief” in terms of both sound and process. They recorded one track a day in Los Angeles. The band has stated that several strong moments on the album came from accidents—for example, lead singer Thom Yorke wrote the creepy lyrics for “Go to Sleep” and the opening line of the entire album (“Are you such a dreamer to put the world to rights?”) as placeholders that the band ultimately decided were actually brilliant. In a similar vein, the frantic repetition of the phrase “and the rain drops” in “Sit Down. Stand up” was born from an attempt to save the song during a confusing live performance. Many of the songs spiral into maniacally repeating phrases, such as “I will eat you alive” in “Where I End and You Begin” and “no” duplicated dozens of times in “A Wolf at the Door” and “A Punchup at a Wedding.”
A political message propels this agitation: “Hail to the Thief” brings the distrust of autocratic government that the band hinted at in “Kid A” and “Amnesiac” to the forefront. In its opening track “2+2=5,” “Hail to the Thief” begins with the weary voice of a citizen reciting the incorrect sum. As always, Radiohead incorporates dense layers of cultural allusions, and this lyric is one of several in the album that gives an appropriately unnerving melody to the ideation of a mind-controlling regime as described in George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” With quivery shrieks, the song builds from its initial expression of conformity to one of resistance that culminates with yelps of “Hail to the thief!” In reference to George W. Bush’s disputed win in the 2000 presidential election, this exclamation’s combination of subservience and ironic defiance sets the tone for the entire album.
In addition to being timely and furious, “Hail to the Thief” is also the most tiring piece of Radiohead’s discography. In sound and lyrics, it is foreboding from start to finish. Frontman Thom Yorke’s vocals drag with appropriate sluggishness over percussion that tends toward persistent teeth-chattering. Its imagery is more brutal than ever, ranging from cannibalism to the bombing of a bunker. Still, in typical Radiohead fashion, depictions of physical violence can often be taken as a metaphor for mental turmoil—for example, the hurricane in “Scatterbrain” feels more cerebral than literal. The images of bloodshed and internal disquiet work together to reinforce the album’s sense of dread.
A common critique is that the album is too long at 56 minutes. Consequently, “Hail to the Thief” has consistently ranked in the bottom half of Radiohead’s nine albums. However, among the repertoire of one of the most critically cherished bands of recent years, this is hardly an indictment. The same qualities that make it seem unwieldy in comparison to many of Radiohead’s other works also make it a moment of catharsis and a suitable response to the turmoil of 2003.
At several unsettling moments, Yorke takes on the voice of the authorities he is criticizing. In “Sit Down. Stand up,” Yorke hypnotically croons, “Walk into the jaws of hell” and “we can wipe you out anytime” as if coercing a body of inhabitants into war. When he takes back the voice of the common people, lyrics like “We tried but there was nothing we could do” from the upbeat bop “Backdrifts” and the refrain of “over my dead body” in the unusually folky “Go to Sleep” portray the people as powerless in the face of violence.
In addition to official states, the public eye is another disabling agent. Over the growling guitar of “Myxomatosis,” Yorke complains that he feels “so tongue tied” in the midst of fame and criticism, and “A Punchup at a Wedding” vents frustration about negative press.
However, one track among all the fidgety paranoia offers a fleeting glimpse of hope. A cross between a soothing piano lullaby and a death march, the third track, “Sail to the Moon,” tells Yorke’s then-infant son Noah, “Maybe you’ll be president / But know right from wrong.” While the rest of the album doubles down on the concept of the varied narrators’ powerlessness, this croon finds hope for reform in the next generation.
“Sail to the Moon” is not the only song that reveals the effects of fatherhood on Yorke. In the stripped-down “I Will,” which emotionally expands on the imagery of “Kid A”’s “Idioteque,” the narrator pledges to protect his children from an event like one he had heard about in the first Gulf War, an attack on a bomb shelter full of women and children. In the pessimistic album closer “A Wolf at the Door,” the narrator sings of a capitalist government’s ability to take away his children.
15 years later, Yorke’s son is nearing adulthood, and Yorke would probably assert that the same global issues he lamented in “Hail to the Thief” are even more in need of fixing today. Yorke has been an outspoken Twitter critic of President Trump, and the concepts of “doublethink,” world leaders threatening violence, and an electoral college “thief” loom large.
At performances of “2+2=5” during their 2016 tour in the United States, Yorke ended the song by shouting “Donald Trump” instead of the usual lyric “maybe not.” This revision catapulted “Hail to the Thief”’s frustration into the present day, and it proved the adaptability of the album’s anger just as much as it pointed out a political backslide.
Though their three albums following “Hail to the Thief” were comparatively introspective and luminous, Radiohead has not avoided seething political commentary. Arguably, the most protest-worthy track published since “Hail to the Thief” has been “Burn the Witch,” a critique of mass hysteria that opens their latest album, “A Moon Shaped Pool” (2016). Six months after its release in May 2016, Yorke tweeted a link to the song in reaction to Trump’s victory.
Perhaps Radiohead will find inspiration from the current political moment in their future works. Still, despite the parallels between the present day and the tumultuous era that kicked off “Hail to the Thief,” nothing close to the 2003 album should be expected: Radiohead’s drive to innovate has consistently allowed them to push boundaries and break expectations, all while articulating the anguish of each moment in time. In all its heaviness and gore, “Hail to the Thief” remains Radiohead’s clearest and most impassioned example of this capability.

In theory, “Mary Shelley” should be a fascinating biopic. It chronicles the adolescent years of the enigmatic writer of “Frankenstein; or the Modern Prometheus,” the daughter of intellectual rebel William Godwin and proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. Born in 1797, Mary Shelley had a rich and long life, during which she loved passionately and suffered greatly for it. She was an incredible storyteller and a powerful female figure within the Gothic tradition. Perhaps counterintuitively, Shelley’s life is almost too much to cover, which is why the film easily loses control, unsure of what parts of her life to tackle. Instead of picking one or two key points, it attempts to address all aspects of Shelley’s life. Even though it is helmed by a compelling lead actress in the form of a mature and haunted Elle Fanning, “Mary Shelley” is too unfocused and scattered to feel like a complete, self-possessed production.
The plot tends towards the episodic, because it tries too hard to cover all the bases of Mary’s youth. This means that the film’s themes and topics are inherently varied, and not enough to tie the entire narrative together. At times, we focus on Mary’s melancholy childhood living in the rougher parts of London with a terse stepmother. At others, we must watch Mary grapple with the legacy of her famous parents, in whose shadow she yearns to stop living in. Before long, we step away from this period of her life, then enter the teenage years after she meets her lover and eventual husband Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Booth), and delve into the nuances of Mary’s complex, fragile, and turbulent relationship with Percy, as well as the principle-free love that they adopted. By the end, however, the plot is hijacked again by the need to trace the inspiration and creation of “Frankenstein.”
It is this thread that best captures the audience’s attention and links most of the film’s scenes together. Had the movie simply concentrated on her classic novel’s creation, it would have had a better structure, especially since it puts forth a very powerful argument that Mary Shelley derived the book’s melancholy tone and tragedy from her failing relationship with her husband. Sadly, however, we are forced to put up with Percy’s endless inane gallivanting, to the point where it becomes difficult to understand why she loves him in the first place. Some might pass this off as part of the complexity of their relationship, but it suggests another fundamental error in the film: It does not know who its antagonists are. It is clear that Lord Byron (Tom Sturridge) and Shelley, with their disdain for others and hedonism masked as freedom, are chiefly to blame for the hell they put Mary through (namely, debt, poor living conditions, heartbreak). The problem with this dark, malevolent portrayal—at least in the case of Shelley—is that it is difficult to understand why Mary keeps returning to him if she spends the first half of the film blaming him for the death of their daughter and the latter half hating him. Pretty boy Douglas Booth plays Shelley as a true nightmare, so much so that it because increasingly hard to trust his qualities—namely idealism—for which he is supposedly redeemable.
It is rare that writers produce their best known works at a young age, but part of Mary Shelley’s fame lies in the fact that she created one of the most famous characters of all time at the tender age of 18. Unlike many renown British female writers who were childless, like Jane Austen and the Brontë sisters, Shelley was a mother. “Frankenstein” was written between her second and third pregnancies, after the death of her first two babies. Though the movie assigns most of the blame for Mary’s loneliness and feeling of abandonment to Percy, it entirely fails to acknowledge Mary’s constant state of pregnancy and her children’s deaths as a major source of influence on her characters. More than anything, this is emblematic of the film’s desire to cover too much, producing half-explored material. To add to that list of incomplete coverage would be Mary’s relationship with her stepsister Claire (Bel Powley), which is loving but offset by Claire’s jealousy regarding Percy, and the ghost of a tenderness between Mary and supporting character John Polidori (Ben Hardy), a subplot that feels almost carelessly touched upon.
With this year marking the bicentennial of “Frankenstein,” it feels more apt than ever to take a look back at Shelley’s allure: daughter of famous and radical intellectuals and wife to one of the most celebrated poets in history. Mary Shelley was also a tour de force in her own right, retaining a singular status within literature. Yet, the movie disconnects us from these facts. While Mary is a hero, managing to publish her novel against all odds, the film fails to fully capture that and essentially reduces her to the victim of unjust circumstances. She is not the formidable writing force and celebrity we have come to know her as, which is perhaps why the production is ultimately so disappointing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I was three years old, my parents accidentally left the television on without supervision, leaving me to watch Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” in all its horror. Honestly, I probably had nightmares about the velociraptors for a week. However, even though my dreams clearly proved that the film’s target audience was not toddlers, “Jurassic Park” also contained kid-friendly parts—parts without dinosaurs stalking you and eating you alive. And those parts entranced me. Something beneath the horror captured my imagination.
In “Jurassic Park,” John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) brings his two grandchildren and a handful of intellectuals to an island called Isla Nublar, where he has created a park full of living dinosaurs. When a disgruntled employee shuts off park power in order to steal the dinosaur embryos, the dinosaurs break free, leaving the small group to fight for their lives. After several deaths and many more life-threatening situations, they make it off the island.
The film now celebrates its 25th anniversary—and it continues to stand alone in film history with its cinematic brilliance, cementing its status as a classic film. It features uniquely strong female characters in an era in which women in movies were just sidekicks, educates the watcher through plot and scientific theory, and explores human nature by recreating an extinct world.
As a young girl with an interest in science, I often turned to film for role models. However, the movie industry doesn’t exactly encourage this interest for girls. Scientists are played almost exclusively by white men. It is important to note that while “Jurassic Park” may be progressive with its female characters, it has only two minor characters of color: Samuel L. Jackson and BD Wong. Clearly, the film still has room for improvement. However, where so many other films fail (for example, Bryce Dallas Howard’s Claire Dearing of the later “Jurassic World” reboot), “Jurassic Park” still gives me powerful female role models: Lex Murphy (Ariana Richards) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern).
Lex is a young, female computer hacker, spending most of the film absorbed in things like interactive CD-ROMs and UNIX systems. Even by modern standards, “Jurassic Park” is massively progressive in its portrayal of Lex as a confident, female programmer. In one of the final scenes, Lex manages to reboot the entire park’s computer system while her younger brother Timmy (Joseph Mazzello) stands by as her cheerleader, iconically reversing gender roles in a way that still lacks prevalence in modern-day filmmaking. In an industry that repeatedly typecasts hackers as males, “Jurassic Park” shows girls like me that we have just as much right to be programmers as boys do.
Likewise, Sattler—a highly educated paleobotanist—serves as a strong female role model. She repeatedly proves her intellect and resourcefulness. In one of several scenes where Sattler puts herself in danger to help the other characters, John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) suggests that he should go out into the park in Sattler’s place because he is a man. However, Hammond’s cowardice quickly wins out as he remains in hiding. Sattler casually shrugs him off: “Look…we can discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.” She then enters the park alone to—once again—save the day.
Seeing these role models proved to me that I didn’t have to follow in the footsteps of the stereotyped Hollywood damsel in distress. Today, whenever someone mentions strong women in entertainment, I think of Lex Murphy and Ellie Sattler—two women who laid the beginning steps of a feminist legacy that continues on today.
“Jurassic Park” also distinguishes itself in its storytelling: Each plotline is started long before the conflict begins. The velociraptor is considered to be one of the most terrifying threats to the park visitors, but doesn’t show up on screen until very late in the film. However, the need to fear the creature is established from the outset: The concept of the velociraptor’s cunning brilliance is introduced in one of the opening scenes, before several of the main characters are even introduced, which establishes a fear that continues to loom above our heads throughout the plot. Similarly, each dinosaur that poses a threat to the park visitors is introduced in one of the opening scenes. By the time the dinosaurs physically appear, we already know them and understand them. “Jurassic Park” subtly establishes its capabilities and bounds from the very start.
Furthermore, the film actually provides a reason why there are dinosaurs in the 20th century. Crichton’s explanations of how Hammond created the dinosaurs are fully fleshed out in the film, and they make logical sense. The dinosaurs’ existence isn’t just magic: it’s science. The idea was created by Michael Crichton, a graduate of medical school and a legendary writer of science fiction, and thus, it’s no wonder that the scientific base for the film is rock solid.
However, perhaps the strongest aspect of this film is how it portrays the dinosaurs and uses them to explore human nature. The dinosaurs are created as an entire class of life—through their initial peaceful appearance, they are shown to be more complex than standard movie monsters. Spielberg creates an entire world that has been extinct for 65 million years. And Hammond tries to trap and control it.
Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) hints at the moral implications of Hammond’s choices: “I’ll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you’re using here. It didn’t require any discipline to attain it. You read what others have done and you took the next step. You didn’t earn the knowledge for yourself so you don’t take any responsibility for it.” Malcolm’s seemingly out-of-place ethical discussions actually get at the heart of the film: The dinosaurs cannot be blamed for behaving as they would in nature, but Hammond can. He takes scientific knowledge from others, and blindly attempts to use it to create entire species with which he is completely unfamiliar. He creates creatures we cannot hope to understand and tries to keep them captive—leaving the park visitors in danger. His arrogance, not the dinosaurs themselves, is what causes conflict.
Though the film physically stays in a science fiction setting, its ideas extend beyond science and scientific advancement. The concept of the morality of scientific advancement is merely a metaphor for the deeper message regarding the dangers of human arrogance. Hammond is arrogant to believe that he may be able to keep creatures he does not understand captive; thus, they escape and wreak havoc. Hammond’s attempt to control that which he does not comprehend ultimately fails—not because working toward scientific advancement is unethical, but because in this particular case, it is arrogant. This idea is what “Jurassic Park” is truly about: The arrogance of mankind is dangerous.
What makes the concept so successful is that the blame can be extended beyond just one character: Hammond creates the park, but every character is entranced by it. They are swept up by the presence of dinosaurs, and, in their awe of Hammond’s creations, ignore the arrogance of his attempt to keep things he does not understand captive. Their childhood imaginations get the better of them, and they succumb to the dangers of Hammond’s arrogance. Spielberg furthers his point when, in their first on-screen time, the dinosaurs are shown with incredible grandeur. From the audience’s perspective, our childhood imaginations are also instantly brought to life like never before. We’re helplessly swept along in its glory. Spielberg makes sure that we, just like the characters, become complacent appreciators of their captivity. The message of the danger of arrogance carries beyond the screen and into our own lives.
Though “Jurassic Park” may be best known as a dinosaur horror flick, from providing inspiration to young girls to exploring the dangers of human nature, the other layers of the film are what make it still relevant today. Since I stumbled upon it as a kid, I’ve watched the movie and read the book an embarrassing amount of times. Something about the world that Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg created continues to mesmerize me, and I can still watch the film and experience the wonder and fear all over again. Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg have left so many messages and ideas for us to unpack. 25 years later, the film still “finds a way.”

Harvard is no stranger to the big screen. The University is often employed in film and television, and it’s rarely reduced to a character’s alma mater. Instead, Harvard features as a centerpiece of their plotline, a cobbled red brick road to follow. With over 5,000 colleges and universities in the United States, Harvard becomes the brand name school of choice without which a screenwriter’s script falls flat.
“Legally Blonde,” the 2001 film that freshmen watch every fall on the steps of Widener, is premised on Elle Woods’s presumed inability to get into Harvard. She’s a ditzy sorority girl studying fashion who, in a boy-crazed attempt to win back an ex, decides to apply to Harvard Law.“You … got into Harvard Law?” her ex-boyfriend Warner asks incredulously. “What? Like it’s hard?” she responds, the joke being, of course, that she must be only person in the country who missed that Harvard has been one of the most selective universities in the country for decades.“Gilmore Girls,” a wildly successful show that ran for seven seasons in the early 2000s with a 2016 Netflix mini-series revival, is premised on Rory Gilmore’s life dream of attending Harvard. At the beginning of the show, Rory’s mother, Lorelai, begrudgingly reconnects with her parents, who she despises, because they promise to pay Rory’s tuition at an elite prep school that will help her gain admission to Harvard. Harvard, with a mix of a mother’s love, outweighs the stress that comes with over a decade of unresolved family drama.These shows use Harvard as a crux, but not Harvard as many of us students, faculty members, and custodial workers have come to know it. “Legally Blonde,” “Gilmore Girls,” and the number of other shows that wield the name, rely on what most viewers imagine this university to be. A randomly-selected American probably could not tell you much about Harvard—who its president is, the different schools at the University, and other things students take for granted. But these same individuals might be able to tell you that Harvard is extremely prestigious, that is incredibly wealthy, that it is incredibly difficult to get into, and that those who attend are intelligent. Those are the most important assumptions made of Harvard, regardless of how accurate they may be.Viewers find movies and shows infused with the Harvard brand name so compelling because a character’s ability to attend Harvard marks them as having a superhuman affinity for rising above their circumstances. Elle Woods graduates at the top of her class, and viewers rejoice because she’s intellectually surpassed the ex-boyfriend for which she was much too good. Though she ends up choosing Yale, Rory Gilmore is accepted to Harvard, fulfilling a lifelong dream after overcoming a pitiable start at an academically rigorous private school. More importantly, both do so relatively unscathed. Rory and Elle both struggle, but their Harvard storylines culminate with them giving graduation speeches to their classmates.While catering to people’s imagination, it fails to acknowledge that Harvard doesn’t just churn out fresh, polished, unscathed young minds. Yes, Harvard produces intelligent, well-rounded individuals who often overcome their own personal story arcs and graduate into wildly successful careers. But Harvard is also the place where people’s mental health takes a turn for the worse, where people begin to resent the institution, where they collect trauma like trading cards.And, worst of all, Hollywood’s Harvard problem is also ours. This motion picture-perfect version of Harvard is the one that clouds our own stories. We offer it when a classmates asks us how we’re doing, offering them a quick “fine” or “well.” We hide behind it when our friends and families ask about how school is going. Like those in television and film, these retellings of our Harvard experience are sanitized, utopic, idealized.
That version of Harvard is as false as the supposed shots of the University in films and television, many of which are filmed at UCLA. Come graduation day, all the good, generative treasures Harvard offers us will be accompanied by a substantial amount of newly-acquired, negative baggage. Slowly, media is acknowledging these unglamorous bits, with Harvard alums serving as the protagonists in shows like “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and “Friends from College” that thrive off their dysfunctional, imperfect, morally-reprehensible characters.But we, as intimate dwellers of this aged institution, have strides left to make in order to truly confront the things about this place we’d rather not see on TV. If we hide behind our smiling faces, short answers, and purposeful omissions, we run the risk of being left only with Hollywood’s Harvard. Identifying a problem is the first step to solving it, whether it be something as large as mental health or something as simple as building a campus that better fosters kindness and human connection. We resign ourselves to the status quo if the only people we are comfortable being, for ourselves and the general public, are Elle Woods and Rory Gilmore.

The Library of Congress awarded University President Drew G. Faust the John W. Kluge Prize for Achievement in the Study of Humanity, Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden announced Tuesday.
The Kluge Prize, a $1 million award, recognizes “individuals whose outstanding scholarship in the humanities and social sciences has shaped public affairs and civil society,” according to a library press release. The winner is selected from a group of finalists from around the world through a three-stage review process by experts from within and outside of the Library of Congress, the world’s largest library.
Hayden said the Library is “thrilled” to award Faust for her work researching, writing, and teaching about American life—particularly as she broke ground as a woman leader in academia.
“Through her extensive writing about Southern identity, she has explored themes of deep relevance to our national conversation on race and gender,” Hayden said. “As the first female president of Harvard University, she has also led one of the most esteemed educational institutions in the world through a period of intense growth and transformation.”
Faust, who is the author of the Bancroft Prize-winning book “This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War,” said she was “deeply honored” to be selected for the Kluge Prize.
“The humanities and social sciences have never been more important to our understanding of society and the increasingly connected world we inhabit,” Faust said. “They allow us to see the world through the eyes of others, to understand the common hopes and aspirations we share, to cultivate judgement and discernment, and to identify and pursue the questions that must animate our pursuit of a better future.”
Faust’s remarks come at a time when higher education is under siege. At her final Commencement address before she steps down at the end of June, Faust dwelled at length on the swelling anti-higher education sentiment in the public sphere and in the halls of Congress.
“At a time of growing distrust of institution and constant attacks on colleges and universities, I want to affirm my belief that they are beacons of hope. I think our best hope for the future to which we aspire,” Faust told the audience in Tercentenary Theatre.
During her tenure, Faust has traveled to Washington D.C. a number of times to lobby on behalf of Harvard and higher education.
Faust’s background as a historian has also marked her decade-long tenure at Harvard. She has worked to help the University reckon with its ties to slavery, appointing a committee and convening a conference to examine this legacy. Faust has also dedicated a plaque at Wadsworth House–the site of her office next fall–to honor the slaves who lived and worked in the building.
Faust will receive the Kluge Prize on September 12 at a gala in the Great Hall of the Library of Congress.
