After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MANKESSIM, Ghana—“You’re my friend! Where is your cam-er-a?” clamor a horde of children around me.
“Oho. No. I don’t have one.”
Most walk away–suddenly, I’m no longer their new best friend!–and I take a look at my fellow volunteers around me. A few are snapping photos of the impressive, welcoming dance festival in our community in Ghana, and most of the rest, I know, have cameras in their bag–or are sharing snapshots with the eager kids.
I’m in Ghana for more than a month, doing a sustainable water internship and travelling around the country. I’m making tons of new friends in this humid and hospitable land. And, of all things to forget (got my malaria pills and quick-dry pants!), I left my camera at home.
I’ve never been more grateful for one of my careless mistakes.
Too often, while exploring and volunteering in new places, I’ve treated every moment like a snapshot waiting to happen. Did you catch that exotic bird flying across the sunset? Click! Oh my God, this jewelry merchant is so friendly – I want a picture with him. And then the harder moments – hiding behind a lens as I snapped hundreds of pictures of Auschwitz; photographing Honduran and Chilean orphans whose lives were vastly more difficult than my own.
Without my Nikon, I feel liberated. I picked up a 30-photo disposable camera in Heathrow, but I’ve yet to wind one frame. I am staring at the world around me and, for the first time, I can feel it staring back.
I always thought I needed photographs to fully remember experiences. Maybe I do – I won’t get results from my unexpected photo-free experiment until I’m back home. Somehow, though, my senses are sharper without my technological crutch. There’s nothing to hide behind, no other way to view my life. I am dancing and building and planning and learning every day; without my camera as a reminder of my normal lifestyle, I’m more immersed in Ghanaian culture than that of any other country I’ve stayed in.
Well, except for the language. I’ve dutifully learned “Abwaaba!” – “Welcome!” as well as a few other handy Fante phrases like “We fre me Leanna.” Yet I’ve only mastered that one because it sounds like “You friend me?” Without the thoroughly modern invention of Facebook, I wouldn’t remember how to introduce myself. Technology, it appears, can both help and hinder these experiences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LONDON, England—One afternoon midweek, I head home early to do some work at our local internet café—the pub.  I pass a signpost in our neighborhood garden displaying “Today’s Weather,” but the group of people who have retired early from work to gather at the pub has already informed me that the weather is unseasonably nice for London. Weaving through the throngs of people and flying trays of glistening cider, I finally arrive at my rickety “desk” in the dark interior of the pub. Like everywhere else in the pre-Jubilee, pre-Olympics London, the pub is decked out in British paraphernalia. But compared to the brash nationalism that I saw in various parades while living in Beijing, the pub’s patriotism was a suiting background—almost a given element.  The country seemed to be approaching the upcoming events in a similar way, as if they were a mere sprinkling of additional gems on a crown already hefty with imperial achievement and tradition.
When I first arrived in London, I must admit, I held some disdain for this attitude of reveling in past imperial glory. I was fresh out of a semester of critiquing the country in my British Empire class and therefore did not expect to hold the same blind admiration for England that I had on past trips.  However, even with this predisposition, I was quickly drawn in by the allure of the city in its summer splendor.  The languorous pleasure of afternoon tea, the spires of Westminster seemingly shooting out of the Thames, and the casual grandeur of riders in pristine britches exercising their horses in Hyde park all reminded me that it is impossible not to appreciate the tradition of this country.
But when my eyes were just beginning to be glazed over by the city’s glory, my job reminded me of what was lying under the façade I was seeing.  History remains a tangible element in the city today, but through my job, I encountered the sagas that aren’t on display in the British Museum. I spent my days in the National Archives reading documents from the end of the Empire that have recently been released for public viewing. While most of the material was relatively benign, occasionally I would stumble across a subtle reference to the former Empire’s darker side: document destruction during decolonization in Kenya or villagization in Emergency Malaya.  Later, I also traveled to the Imperial War Museum where the voices of the government officials who I had gotten to know through these documents were preserved on hundreds of reels of interviews.
Beyond the revelry of pub-goers and the summer routines of Londoners, these voices and these documents represented the other side of humanity I encountered in London.  The dichotomy of my experience in the city reminded me to always be aware of what lies beneath the exterior—the meticulously trimmed hedges of the parks, the neat rows of townhouses, and the well-worn interior of my favorite pub. Over a century ago, Rudyard Kipling, himself an advocate for British imperialism, wrote the phrase “lest we forget” in “Recessional,” a poem honoring Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.  As the Jubilee and Olympics come and go, I believe it is especially vital to heed Kipling’s warning and remember the imperial stories that aren’t on display while we celebrate England at its finest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TANGA, TANZANIA—When my fellow interns and I walked into the Association of Private Health Facilities in Tanzania (APHFTA) training session we were leading for local doctors in the seaport city of Tanga, I felt assured that I knew what I was doing. After all, we had already worked with many different clinics in other parts of the country, helping them use technology to more easily and efficiently keep records and communicate with their patients. As I walked in, I opened up one of the small, black netbooks we were using for training and sat next to an elderly doctor with a slightly furrowed forehead and a perpetual smile bouncing on his lips. I could see him observing me intently as I plugged in the Airtel internet modem into the USB drive and prayed that four little bars would pop up in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.
I prayed for a long time.
Ah, only in Tanzania. “Slow connection?” the doctor said, looking at me knowingly. Luckily, Dr. Mberesero wasn’t the type to get frustrated, and to him, our waiting time for one connection just presented an opportunity for a different one. “So, why do you want to study medicine?” he asked, with that distinctive Tanzanian accent that I have come to love.
That was the beginning of the longest, and most meaningful waiting conversation I have ever had—a small blue circle pivoting furiously on our blue screen all the while. No matter, one lack of connection had led to the ability to make another.
In the U.S., I have learned to accept the long expanses of time spent waiting on a doctor and hoping that he will be able to spare a few minutes of his valuable time to answer my questions. I’ll watch the minutes tick away as I become well acquainted with the hospital waiting room because Dr. So-and-So has too many patients to tend to and will be out in just a minute so that his student intern can introduce herself. In America, waiting is an endless menace that tantalizes you with the promise that it will all be worth it on the other side.
In Tanzania, you don’t wait on someone or for someone—you wait with them. When I came to Africa, I expected the usual smattering of naïve, misguided perceptions to be cast astray and an SD card full of new memories and experiences to return home with by the end of two months. What I didn’t expect was that I would do so much waiting—or, more importantly, that I would count those moments while the “Connecting…” window floats lazily on a computer screen among my most treasured here.
Many people, like  myself, do not truly know about Africa. Worse, many of them are too impatient to experience it for themselves before making a judgment. The Tanzanian doctors and nurses who walk into our training everyday have given me the gift of getting to know at least one part of this incredibly diverse continent.  They –with all their years of medical education behind them—also have an unparalleled patience and a willingness to learn from me, just an 18 year old girl who sits with them while the small blue circle spins furiously. Thinking about it now, I realize what a lovely little circle it is. A furious, impatient, connection-granting circle. It too is hopelessly oblivious to an understanding that the Tanzanians have had all along and have so graciously shared with me in my time here—there is no such thing as waiting for connection, just the thrill of waiting with it.

MONTPELLIER, France—I'd been to the park a handful of times before noticing the apricot tree. The apricots were mostly near the top, so we had to climb and jump to shake them down. We gathered as many as we wanted and left the rest scattered around on the ground.
A little later, an old Arab woman approached the tree from the other direction. She wore a full length dress with a purple blue and black floral pattern and a black headscarf. She circled the tree, picking the fruits that she could reach. When she got to where we sat she stared down at us and the wasted fruit. I could see tattoos on the forehead and chin of her wrinkled face. She muttered something unintelligibly and gestured with dismay to the apricots on the ground. We stared back in confusion. Then she walked away and sat on a bench, looking out at the park. An Iraqi girl from the language school I've been studying at explained that, in Iraq at least, those face tattoos are an indication that a woman is from the very lowest rung of society.
I watched the old woman as she soon got up and relocated to another bench. Later she moved to another bench, and then another, alone and staring blankly in front of her. I wondered what the tattoos meant for her now in France, and why she was spending her Wednesday afternoon migrating from bench to bench at this little park.
Eventually an old man, nicely dressed with a full head of white hair, came up and sat beside her. They shook hands and she offered him an apricot. Eventually other elderly women came and joined them, some in the manner of dress common to Middle Eastern women here, others clad in a more European style. They all sat and gazed out at the park together, but I couldn't see if she gave out any more apricots.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—While I can’t say that my Spanish skills are getting any better here (and my English is certainly getting worse,) I can proudly say that I have developed one skill during my three weeks here in Buenos Aires. I learned how to get lost.
In my defense, Buenos Aires is huge. It is over 30,000 kilometers squared, and since I don’t understand the metric system, I can only assume that this is like a billion miles. Plus, it’s filled with thousands of people who don’t understand my gringo accent and who apparently used the video game “Grand Theft Auto” to learn how to drive. To say pedestrians do not have the right of way here is an understatement. They are more like targets.
So, it is not surprising that the first few times I tried to get to school I got lost. My knowledge of public transportation is worse than my knowledge of the metric system, so when I took the bus to my school, I had no idea where to get off. I got off at the wrong bus stop (surprise) and immediately panicked.  Not only did I have no idea where I was; I had no idea how to ask for help.
After a couple of minutes of helplessly looking for street signs, and praying that I could magically end up where I needed to go (turns out I don’t have teleportation powers), I decided to do something rational, so I called one of my professors in a panic and screamed, “Como se dice I’m lost in the middle of nowhere?” into my cell phone.
“Where are you?” he asked.
I was in Bulnes, but my accent was so bad I had to spell the street name out for him. It is hard to talk and fight back tears at the same time. Ten minutes later, my teacher arrived in a taxi and walked me to class. I was only half an hour late!
Now, after three weeks of consistently getting lost, I have finally got it down. I now skip steps one through seven (which involve plenty of tears and a small snack) and proceed immediately to steps eight through ten.
8. Get out my map.
9. Realize that I have no idea how to read a map.
10. Hail a taxi.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina–My hands fumbled from tiredness as I searched for my keys in my purse. My fingers closed around ticket stubs, my cellphone, a crumpled copy of my passport, and my subway pass, but not the heavyset brass keys that I sought. I glanced down at my watch and anxiety sank into my heart as I read the time: 5:32 a.m.
Just like New York, Buenos Aires is the “city that never sleeps,” but the people in Buenos Aires sure do take naps quite frequently. With hundreds of clubs that don’t even open until 1 a.m., Buenos Aires has nightlife unlike any other city. Evenings for club-goers don’t peak until 3 or 4 a.m. and certainly don’t end until 5 a.m. or later.
This was already the latest I had ever been awake in my whole life and my entire body ached for the bed waiting for me upstairs. But of course, I had forgotten the keys to the apartment. Of course, the first night I went out had to be the night I got locked out.
I am staying with a local family, and the last thing I wanted to do was wake “my mom” up at this ungodly hour. After telling my woes to the unsympathetic doorman for 15 minutes in clumsily worded Spanish, I finally decided to ring the buzzer to the apartment.
My 60-year-old porteño mother opened the door and I cringed with anxiety for her response. All I found were open arms and a concerned voice asking me if I had been waiting outside for long.
The people in Buenos Aires, while described protestors, pessimists, and lovers of mayonnaise, can also be labeled as welcoming. For centuries, a multitude of ethnicities, heritages, and stories have found their home amidst the skyward buildings of the port city. Just like the city seems to have open arms, the people of Buenos Aires also always seem willing to welcome and accept those who enter. There seems to be a place for every person in the city–even this extranjera.
While I now feel like I belong in the city, it’s still comforting to know that my host mom won’t leave me out in the streets when I get locked out around dawn. But just in case, I double check to make sure that I have my keys when I go out now.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden—I’ve made it to Sweden: land of IKEA, meatballs, and blond people. Everything you’ve heard is true. Along with their liberal mindsets and love of pop music (Sweden won Eurovision this year), there’s a heavy emphasis on childhood here, with movies like Pippi Longstocking making sure that all of those little blond children have the same innocent upbringing as their parents did.
I feel so at home here. Being able to speak the language–although basically everyone here also speaks English–and looking pretty Scandinavian doesn’t hurt, I suppose, but I get the feeling that Swedes know how to live. Sunshine, red cottages scattered everywhere in the archipelago, ice cream twice a day… Could be worse. I may be biased, but what with all of the yellow buildings lining clean, cobblestoned streets, seemingly floating in the midst of sparkling water, Stockholm is truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world. I’m reluctant to leave, men livet är bra.

VICKSBURG, Mississippi—When most international students hear I-20, they think of the document that grants them entry into the United States. For me, however, I-20 means Interstate 20, the highway along the Mississippi leading to Vicksburg. Yes, that same Vicksburg, which you may have read about in some version of United States history but is probably now buried somewhere in the back of your mind...
My first week in Vicksburg, I spent most of my mornings walking through the famous Vicksburg National Military Park. Not only is it ideally situated at the ledge overlooking the great Mississippi River, but it is also an excellent way to learn about the history of the South and the Civil War, especially if you know nothing (and I mean nothing) about it. In fact, Vicksburg was famous for the “Siege of Vicksburg,” during which the Union Army, led by Ulysses S. Grant, put the Confederates at Vicksburg to (as one might expect) siege. What I didn’t know was that this quaint town has an even deeper history and was part of the Natchez Native Americans' territory.
But probably the best thing that Vicksburg has to offer more than the history is the Southern hospitality. The people of Vicksburg are very, and I mean very, welcoming. They invite you to dinner, cook for you, smile and say hi for no apparent reason. On top of that, they like to get to know you.  For the average Harvard student, the pace of life may appear to be a little too slow, but for someone trying to do thesis research, it is the ideal place. Not to mention, people are pretty smart here, since Vicksburg has the highest concentration of per capita engineers in the entire nation!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a surprising year-end run that nearly culminated in an ECAC title, the Harvard men’s hockey team graduated some of its top players, including forward Alex Killorn, who paced the squad with 46 points in 2011-12.
But just months after the Crimson’s most prolific goalscorer in nearly a decade headed south to play in the Tampa Bay Lightning organization, a new crop of NHL draftees—including another Lightning pick—is coming to Cambridge.
Incoming freshmen left winger Jimmy Vesey and right winger Brian Hart were selected in this year’s NHL Draft, held on Friday and Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pa. While Vesey was taken in the third round by the Nashville Predators, the Lightning selected Hart in the second round with the 53rd overall pick.
Hart became just the seventh player in Crimson history to be taken in the first two rounds of the draft and is Harvard’s highest draft pick since Louis Leblanc, who was selected in the first round of the 2009 draft. Leblanc is now part of the Montreal Canadiens organization and played in the NHL this past season.
Not surprising given their high draft selections, both Hart and Vesey had standout seasons in 2011-12. At Phillips Exeter, Hart averaged over two points per game. Vesey, meanwhile, played for the Eastern Junior Hockey League’s South Shore Kings, where he set a scoring record with 91 points (48 goals) in 45 games.
Following Hart’s and Vesey’s selection this weekend, the Crimson now has seven drafted players in its rising freshmen and sophomore classes.

It's 1:30 in the morning, and you're hungry. But where do you go? It is a divisive debate among the Harvard student body, and loyalties to the Square's late-night stops run deep. Over an 11 day period, The Crimson will debate 11 popular choices around campus. Now up: Domino's.
Harvard Square has a rich legacy of unique, one-of-a-kind restaurants. Mr. Bartley’s, Noch’s, and the Kong are just a few of the places that we all must experience at some point during our time here at Harvard.
But when it comes to late-night food stops, one Harvard Square tradition towers over the rest. I am, of course, talking about Domino’s Pizza.
There is no question that when it comes to convenience, Domino’s can’t be beat. Who wants to trek all the way to IHOP in the pouring rain or freezing winter when you can have Domino’s delivered right to your door? Pizzas often arrive in 20 minutes, sometimes less, and Domino’s online tracking system tells you where in the pizza-making process your food is (and, to make it that much more personal, the name of the individual preparing it), never leaving you wondering how much longer until it’s in your hands.
Domino’s is also the best late-night value at Harvard (sorry CVS, Tostitos chips and salsa doesn’t count as a meal—if I wanted that, I would just go to brain break and get it for free). Using one of Domino’s continuously-available online coupons, you can get two two-topping medium pizzas for just $5.99 each. To put that in perspective, that’s an entire eight-slice pizza for about the same price as one Felipe’s burrito, only a dollar more than two slices at Noch’s, and cheaper than virtually all the entrees at the Kong. Instead of taking a bite out of your wallet, it’s time to start biting into the best value in town.
The final, and most often overlooked, benefit of Domino’s is the quality of its food. Domino’s makes a pretty damn good pizza. Those of you who haven’t had Domino’s in a long while may be scratching your heads, remembering the cardboard crust and plastic cheese of our childhood. I can assure you, those days are long gone. Domino’s has completely reinvented its pizzas over the last couple of years, introducing a new sauce, new cheese, and flavored crusts that are the quite possibly best you’ve ever had.
Plus, with dozens of toppings and trillions of possible topping combinations—not to mention its entire lineup of sandwiches, delicious cheesy breadsticks, desserts, and other non-pizza options—Domino’s offers a variety that can’t be found anywhere else at 1:30 AM.
Some of you may be outraged at the sauciness of my claims. Others may find this post a bit cheesy at first. But once you get past all that, there is no denying, in the wee hours of the night, Domino’s is the best option around.

For those who just can't stand the gray tones of the current my.harvard.edu page, the end is in sight. The results of Harvard University Information Technology's redesign contest are in, and students now have the opportunity to vote for their favorite design here.
According to HUIT Communications Officer Nicholas L. Connors, 12 potential redesigns were submissions for the contest. The student IT advisory board then selected three of these designs.
UC President Danny P. Bicknell '13 said that a final decision is expected by July 2.
