After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Association for Computing Machinery awarded Professor Leslie G. Valiant of the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences the Turing Award, one of the most prestigious prizes in computer science, for his research in the field of artificial intelligence last week.
Valiant’s research laid the theoretical ground for machine learning, according to several of his colleagues. His work has led to the technology for computer vision, natural language processing, and handwriting recognition in computers, among other advancements.
The Turing Award, often considered “the Nobel Prize of computing,” includes a $250,000 cash prize, partially funded by Google and Intel, according to ACM’s public relations manager Virginia Gold.
Shortly before ACM’s announcement last Thursday, Valiant’s research was already gaining recognition on television sets across the country.
Earlier this month, IBM’s Watson computer defeated two former champions of the “Jeopardy!” game show in a series of highly anticipated on-air rounds. Much of Valiant’s research in the 1980s was critical for the development of the computer, which has been seen as a milestone of artificial intelligence research.
“[Valiant] provided the theoretical basis for progress in artificial intelligence,” Gold said. “Those are the kinds of techniques that have enabled computing systems like Watson to rival humans abilities to answer questions—those kinds of things provided the groundwork for this machine.”
ACM said the Turing award is given to individuals whose contributions are of lasting and major importance to computer science.
“For the field of computing, [Valiant] provided a fundamental foundation for advances in machine learning,” Gold said. “I also think it’s great for Harvard. [The award] is in a competitive field, but it’s in a field that’s making huge strides.”
Harvard professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher said that he agreed that the award is beneficial for Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“I imagine and hope it will raise our visibility,” Mitzenmacher said. “It gives us something to show the rest of the world. [Valiant] has always been brilliant, so in some sense, nothing has actually changed. But it’s a nice sign of recognition for Harvard and SEAS as a whole.”
Valiant’s past accomplishments in mathematics and computing have also been awarded. He won the Nevanlinna Prize in 1986 for his mathematical advancements in the field of computer sciences; he also won the Knuth Prize in 1997 and the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science award in 2008.
“This is not the only thing he has done in his career,” Mitzenmacher said. “He has won many awards in the past and this is just the crowning award to a stellar career.”
Valiant could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the score knotted at 4-4 at the end of the first quarter, a fast-paced second quarter saw the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (3-1) outscore Bellarmine (2-4), 8-1. It was all the Crimson needed to break open the game and guarantee a victory Friday night at the Soldier’s Field Lacrosse Stadium.
The Knights came out of the gates strong, scoring two unanswered goals in the first three minutes of action and prompting an early Harvard timeout.
“Coach just told us to buckle down on defense,” co-captain attack Dean Gibbons said, “and keep up the fast paced offensive team that we have, and we were able to score a lot of goals.”
The timeout was effective, as the Crimson rattled off three straight goals over the next nine minutes, including goals from Gibbons, sophomore midfield Alex White, and junior attack Jeff Cohen.
Bellarmine would not fold and responded with two goals to recapture the lead, 4-3, with 59 seconds left in the first quarter. Harvard would answer just 19 seconds later off an unassisted goal from White, tying the score at 4-4 to end the first quarter.
Though the Knights struck first in the second frame, Harvard took control of the quarter, scoring eight straight goals that put the Crimson up, 12-5, going into halftime. The run saw five different Harvard players score, including three from freshman midfield Daniel Eipp and two from Cohen.
“We really picked up our transition game and did a good job of clearing the ball from defense to offense,” Gibbons said. “We were just able to capitalize on the opportunities that we had on the offense end.”
Eipp, who had four goals and notched an assist, led a Harvard offense that saw 10 different players score. Gibbons and Cohen each scored three goals while Gibbons also tallied five assists.
“Danny Eipp had a really good game,” Gibbons said. “He scored a couple goals in the Georgetown game, and coach Wojcik has been playing him on attack a little bit more now. [Eipp] has been doing really well, and we’re looking for him to do big things this season.”
A trio of juniors in attack, attack Devin Peurach, midfielder Will Cary, and attack Luke Acton scored two goals apiece to lead the way for the Knights. Cary also tallied an assist.
The Crimson and Bellarmine would exchange goals to start the third quarter, setting the score at 14-7. Harvard would go on another run, keyed by a goal by junior co-captain Kevin Vaughn during a man-down situation. The Knights would respond with five seconds left in the third quarter.
“They have a lot of good guys out on their defensive end,” Gibbons said. “And we were able to figure it out by moving the ball fast, and taking better angled shots.
Bellarmine carried the momentum into the fourth quarter, scoring two straight to bring the score to 17-10. Yet the Crimson would go on another run, scoring four straight, keyed by a goal from junior midfielder Mark Scalise in a man-up situation, assisted by junior midfielder Terry White, that would ensure the victory.
Harvard’s offensive system was able to consistently generate shots throughout the night—averaging 15 shots a quarter—to out-shoot the Knights, 60-37, on the night.
“Our game plan for every game is just to improve and get better from the previous game that we played,” Gibbons said. “We did that from Hoftra to Georgetown, we did that from Georgetown to Bellarmine, and hopefully we can do that [today] against Holy Cross.
"If we can do that all year long, then at the end of the season, we’ll be a pretty good team and be very happy with the results.”

The Harvard men's and women's fencing teams each had notable performances on Sunday at the NCAA Northeast Regional Championships in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
For the Crimson women’s fencing team (18-5), junior Noam Mills took first in the epee while freshman Alexandra Keifer won the foil.
With these wins, Mills and Keifer look poised to qualify for the NCAA championships, which will be held in Columbus, Ohio on March 24. Although competitors in the national championships will not be announced officially until later today, Harvard expects to be well-represented.
“We are anticipating that we will have 11 qualify,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “And considering the field this year, that may get us into a position to finish in the top three. Of course, schools can send a maximum of 12 competitors, but looking at the fill this year, there will be very few other schools out there with [even] 11 qualifying.”
Mills began the day ranked third in the epee, but she jumped into competition hot, going 5-for-6 in her first round of pool play. Her streak continued in the second round where she defeated six straight opponents, moving her up to second in the rankings behind Zsophia Fath of St. John’s University. Yet in the final round of pool play, Mills edged out Fath by winning 9-of-11 in comparison to Fath’s eight.
Meanwhile, Keifer, who came in ranked first, dominated the foil competition from start to finish, only losing two bouts—one in her second round and one in the final—ending the day with a .909 victory-to-bout ratio.
“I think it’s hard to set such a high standard [your freshman year]” Keifer said. “But I’m excited to keep improving. And I want to do better at the Ivy’s—we only got third this year—and I’m hoping that sometime in the next three years, we can make that a first.”
The women struggled in the sabre with their top finisher, junior Hayley Levitt, coming in 11th on the day.
The Harvard men’s team (19-2) had representation in the top three of every class.
Sophomore Tommaso di Robilant took third in the foil after being originally ranked 12th in the class. He climbed to fourth place after the first two rounds of pool play, going 5-for-6 and then 4-for-6. In the third and final rounds, he won eight out of 11 bouts, knocking New York University’s Philip Jamesson down to sixth place to claim third for the Crimson.
“As usual, I had a slow start,” di Robilant said. “But I picked it up in the second round. Unfortunately I had to fight against my teammates in that round…but we all came out of it pretty good. Thankfully, I managed to make it to the final round.”
In the epee, freshman Michael Raynis also took third place in the competition, despite his original fourth-place ranking behind the Red Storm’s power trio of Nicholas Vomero, Marat Isrealian, and Adam Watson. Raynis also came out slow, and a rough first round demoted him to 14th. But he bounced back with six straight victories in the third round to eventually edge out Watson for third place behind Vomero and Israelian.
The men continued their success in the sabre, sweeping three of the top-four spots. Although they relinquished first place to St. John’s Daryl Homer, Harvard’s junior Valentin Staller, sophomore Thomas Kolasa and freshman Eric Arzoian blocked out all other Red Storm threats.
In the first round, both Kolasa and Staller were perfect—5-for-5 and 6-for-6, respectively—while Arzoian only dropped one. Arzoian also only lost one in the second, while Kolasa and Staller both went 4-for-6. In the final round of play, Arzoian and Kolasa both won seven out of 11 bouts, while Staller climbed to his third-place finish, going 8-of-11.
“The thing about this tournament is it’s a very long and exhausting day,” di Robilant said. “The final round [11 bouts] was long and tough.”
“We pretty much did what we anticipated we’d do,” Brand said. “And we were prepared both physically and emotionally for this tournament. We have a good practice and conditioning schedule throughout the year, and both the men and the women were able to keep pace. Overall, I’m very happy with the results.”
The scoring for men’s and women’s fencing is based on a co-gender system, meaning that both Crimson teams will be fighting together later this month.
“I know everyone’s really excited,” Keifer said. “We got fifth last year, and I know we can do better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As often occurs in the days following Selection Sunday, the debate has begun over which teams should and shouldn't have gotten into the NCAA tournament.
For the first time ever, a great deal of the discussion has centered around the Harvard men’s basketball team, whose RPI of 35 was the highest of any squad not to be offered a spot in 2011's Madness.
Many analysts have argued that the Crimson deserved a spot in the 68-team field over squads such as UAB—which did not beat a single team in this year's tournament—and, to a lesser extent, VCU, which finished in third place in the Colonial Athletic Association with an RPI 14 spots lower than Harvard’s. Other bubble teams to make the tournament over the Crimson included Clemson (RPI 57) and USC (67).
In an ESPN poll taken during Selection Sunday, half the country felt the Crimson deserved an invite to March Madness.  Here’s a look at what others have said regarding the Crimson and the Dance:
ESPN’s Jay Bilas tweeted that “St. Mary's and Harvard should have been in before UAB and VCU. This is not about major or mid-major. This is about best teams, in order.” He added on ESPN’s Bracketology that “You know who really got jobbed? Harvard...Harvard has as good a case, if not better, than UAB and VCU.”
ESPN’s Dick Vitale stated on the same program that “If you’re going to honor NCAA, the true, genuine definition of a student athlete, does it get more so than up there at Harvard? Think about it. They beat Colorado. They beat Boston College at Boston College. They beat Boston U, that’s in the tournament. I think that you could make a great case for Tommy Amaker and Harvard.”
On ESPN’s Outside the Lines, analyst and former Alabama head coach Mark Gottfried said, “I think [the Crimson] did [deserve an at-large bid]. If you look at who some of the teams that were selected in late–I think UAB and VCU are the teams everybody is talking about...I look at Harvard, I look at who they beat, I look at their RPI, when you compare teams against one another, Harvard to me rises to the top."
Before the bracket was announced, Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe argued both Princeton and Harvard should be put into the tournament and asked, “So would it somehow disturb the natural order of things in the college basketball world if the tournament committee rewarded an Ivy cochampion with an RPI of 35 that was beaten in a playoff game on a shot with no time left?..If there’s any justice, the letters following the ‘N’ in [Harvard’s] postseason tournament will be ‘C,’ ‘A,’ and ‘A,’ not ‘I’ and ‘T.’”
On ESPN’s Pardon the Interruption Monday, co-host Michael Wilbon said, “Don’t tell me Penn State had to be in...don’t tell me Illinois had to be in...don’t tell me Harvard had to be out at the expense of one of them.”
ESPN’s Eamonn Brennan wrote that “Harvard...could make an argument that its resume is legitimately better than UAB's. At least the Crimson beat somebody.”
Sports Illustrated’s Dan Shaugnessy called Harvard the biggest snub of the tournament, ripping the selection committee by saying, “There was virtually no difference between Princeton and Harvard this season. Just one shot. And Princeton got a 13 seed and Harvard got dissed. Not even worthy of bubble talk...There's always going to be room for John Calipari, who has already had two Final Four appearances vacated, but there's no room for Harvard.”
Shaugnessy’s colleague at Sports Illustrated, Andy Glockner, deemed Harvard one of his biggest snubs.
The Sporting News’ Michael DeCourcy tweeted that “If there's room in [ESPN’s Joe] Lunardi's bracket for USC, I just can't see how Harvard gets left out.”
NewsOK, discussing Oklahoma State’s matchup with the Crimson in the NIT, wrote that “Harvard had the resume of an NCAA Tournament team.”
The newspaper quoted Harvard coach Tommy Amaker as saying his players were “heartbroken and devastated”  by the snub.
But despite its strong profile and Big Dance near-miss, the Crimson received only a six-seed in the NIT, and thus must travel to Stillwater, Okla., where it will take on the Cowboys tonight at 7:30 p.m. There, on national television, it will have the opportunity to prove its doubters wrong–NCAA and NIT selection committees alike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rebecca Nadler ended her season as she began it: as one of the best in the field. The freshman alpine skier's 20th place finish in the slalom event led Harvard's three-woman charge to a 17th-place finish in the NCAA Championships, hosted last week by the University of Vermont in Stowe, Vt.
For Nadler, the finish capped a season-long recovery from illness. But the freshman and sophomore teammate Catherine Sheils continued to face obstacles heading into the race.
"I got a call on Tuesday saying 'We're moving up the race and racing tomorrow,'" alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. "We didn't get on the road till six o'clock on Tuesday and were racing at 8 a.m. on Wednesday."
In the first women's alpine event, the giant slalom, Nadler finished 33rd, just two places ahead of teammate Catherine Sheils, who took 35th.
"The [giant slalom] was certainly a little frustrating for Catherine and me," Nadler said. "Catherine lost her ski, and I had a little fall."
According to Mitchell, both skiers fell victim to tough conditions.
"[Stowe] got two and a half or three feet of snow, and then it started raining on top of it, and then it snowed on top of that," Mitchell said.
The conditions created holes in the slopes, which proved especially treacherous to skiers starting at the back of the pack—as Nadler and Sheils were.
"Rebecca...was making a great turn. Snow peeled out, and she fell. Catherine was skiing probably her best giant slalom, but she hit one of those holes, and her ski popped off."
Saturday proved to be a better day, particularly for Nadler who rallied to take 20th in the slalom.
"I focused on staying solid and balanced and level on my skis," she said. "I kept it simple."
Nadler managed to score highly despite starting second to last.
"Rebecca skied a great first run and moved up to 18th," Mitchell said. "She started to ski like herself again [after being sick]. She hit a bump in the second run and lost two places...They do split times in the middle of the course. She was actually in eighth place at the split time...20th at the national championships is still a pretty good result."
Sheils took 28th in the event after falling during the race.
"She was a fighter," Nadler said of Sheils. "She really showed a lot of stamina. It was impressive to see her work ethic and how she pushed through."
Sophomore Alena Tofte, meanwhile, earned a 31st place finish in the 5k free race and 35th in the 15k mass start race.
"It's the best collegiate skiers in the country, and she held up really well," said Nordic coach Chris City '94. "I think Alena skied pretty close to her best race both days. She went out early, and it was really hard to know [how she was doing]. She just had to put her head down. As it turned out, she was right in it with the bulk of the skiers. So that was phenomenal. What was great was that she went out and attacked it. She went out and skied her best."
It was a strong weekend all around for teams from the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association. The EISA had 10 teams represented at the 21-team event, and four—Dartmouth, the University of Vermont, the University of New Hampshire, and Middlebury—finished in the top 10. The Big Green led the charge with a third-place finish.
"I think there's a reputation that the west teams are stronger, and I think what we saw, particularly on Wednesday, was that that wasn't the case."
Harvard's coaches and athletes said that the experience will make all three Crimson athletes better skiers in the future.
"It's good for them to get their first NCAA championships under their belt," Mitchell said. "That way they go there again, it will be just another race. The result will take care of itself."
But results aside, this trip was special in that it happened at all. Nadler and Sheils were the first female alpine skiers ever to qualify for NCAAs, and Tofte was the first to compete since Anna McLoon '04.
"It was a really cool experience for all," Nadler said. "It was kind of cool to be making history."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing this past weekend in both the 18th St. Mary’s Invitational and the Navy Women’s Intersectional, the Harvard sailing team was unable to replicate its success of two weekends ago, when the coed squad won the Sharpe Trophy Team Race.
This time the Crimson's coed team, sailing in the waters of St. Mary’s River, brought home third-place accolades, placing behind Boston College and Georgetown. Harvard's sailors went 17-4 in the 10-team competition, tying with the Hoyas and losing by one race to the Eagles.
Harvard’s team was composed of senior John Stokes, senior Alan Palmer, and senior Teddy Himler as skippers, and sophomore Alma Lafler, senior Quincy Bock, and senior Meghan Wareham served as the crew.
After the first round-robin competition on Saturday, the Crimson stood on top with Georgetown, with each boasting 8-1 records.
In the second round-robin, Harvard did not fare as well, going 6-3, yet the team still placed third overall, enough for a place in the championship round.
The Crimson won the next three races in the championship round but ultimately fell short to Boston College. Though Harvard tied with Georgetown, the Hoyas took second because it held the head-to-head tiebreaker.
Meanwhile, the women’s team was sailing along the waters near Navy, hoping to bring home some hardware in its first regatta of the spring season.
In the 18-team field, the Crimson took 10th at 338 points, finishing 181 points behind the champion—again, Boston College. The top four finishers included the Eagles, Brown, Yale, and Georgetown.
To start off the regatta, the A division sailed in the FJ’s while the B division competed in the 420s. After nine races, the A and B divisions switched fleets and raced one more time before the end of the first day of competition. Harvard ended the day with 185 points.
On Sunday, the Crimson sailed in eight more races to close out the event. It proved to be a tougher day.
“We were trying to be consistent and not being too fazed by the conditions. By middle of the day of Saturday and Sunday, it was a totally different mode to sail in. We were trying to be as good as we can be in the conditions,” junior Alex Jumper said.
“It was good practice to sail in different venues compared to the conditions at home," the A-division sailor added. "And we had to practice sailing smart. Saturday morning was not as windy. We’re focusing on different aspects of boat handling. Once it starts to get windier, we’re focusing on boat speed.”
In both divisions, Harvard had only one top-four finish in the 16 races on Sunday. At the end of the day, it tallied 153 points, landing the Crimson in the bottom half of the regatta.
“It was the first regatta of the season. Usually we are able to practice by the end of February or beginning of March. It was our first time in a boat together since the end of the fall season,” Jumper said. “There was a bit of a learning curve at first. There were pretty challenging conditions. Pretty windy and chilly. It was not a bad start, and we’re hoping to improve.”
Next weekend, the coed team and the women’s team will switch things up, competing for the 64th Truxton Umstead Trophy at Navy and at the 22nd Women’s Intersectional at St. Mary’s, respectively.

STILLWATER, Okla.—For the second straight season, the Harvard men’s basketball team reached the postseason. And for the second straight season, the Crimson made an early exit.
Suffering from a poor shooting performance and facing a more physical opponent, Harvard bowed out in the first round of the NIT Tuesday night, falling, 71-54, to Oklahoma State in front of a Gallagher-Iba Arena crowd of 5,342.
“Certainly not one of our better performances,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “We’ve been a much better basketball team this season, and [it's] disappointing, given the kind of year we’ve had, to have this kind of send off to our final game.”
The sixth-seeded Crimson (23-7, 12-2 Ivy) was overpowered by the Cowboys’ frontcourt duo of Marshall Moses and Matt Pilgrim, who combined for 30 points and 12 rebounds. Moses led all scorers, finishing with 18 points on 7-of-10 shooting.
“They’re tough around the post area,“ said Amaker, whose squad was outrebounded, 31 to 23. “Pilgrim and Moses, those kids are strong...We always try to establish an inside presence for our team and then play out from there. We were never able to do that, I think, because of those two kids in particular.”
The Crimson was also hindered by a sub-par shooting night, finishing 22-of-55 from the field, a mark of 40 percent. Harvard also managed to get to the line just seven times on the evening—a season low.
Pilgrim established Oklahoma State’s interior dominance on the contest’s opening possession, sinking a fade-away jumper from the right block over Crimson sophomore Kyle Casey.
But it was Cowboy guard Reger Dowell who sparked the hosts (20-13, 6-10 Big XII) in the game’s opening minutes. Dowell, who finished with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting, got into the lane with ease, scoring six of the Cowboys’ first 20 points and assisting on another basket.
Less than six minutes into the contest, the Crimson found itself in a nine-point hole after Keiton Page cut to the basket and sank a floater from the left baseline.
The Crimson cut its deficit to four off a two-handed slam by Casey—the visitors' leading scorer with 13 points—but a three from Page and a floater from Dowell put the Cowboys back up by nine.
Oklahoma State’s lead grew from there, reaching as many as 16 before the conclusion of the first half.
Trailing by 14 coming out of the break, the Crimson surrendered a pair of layups to Pilgrim and Moses on Oklahoma State’s first two possessions but soon managed to secure some stops.
And after opening the contest shooting 42.7 percent from the field, Harvard finally managed to sink some shots, igniting a 12-2 run that cut the Cowboys’ lead to eight.
Following a missed shot from Pilgrim in the post, the Crimson pushed the ball up the floor and found sophomore Christian Webster open on the left wing. Webster knocked down the open shot for his lone three-pointer on the night.
After coming up with another stop on the defensive end, Harvard pushed the pace again, this time finding Casey streaking down the lane for an easy two-handed slam.
Moses answered with a basket in the post, but junior co-captain Oliver McNally followed with a long ball to cut Oklahoma State’s lead to 12, 47-35.
One minute later, Casey cut the deficit to 10, coming up with a steal near midcourt and finishing with a slam. After Pilgrim was whistled for traveling, junior co-captain Keith Wright brought the Crimson within single digits, finishing with his left hand under the basket.
“We just took it one possession at a time,” sophomore Brandyn Curry said. “We said we had to knock down our open shots, and during that spurt we did.”
But eight was as close as the Crimson would get.
On the Cowboys’ next possession, Markel Brown stuck a deep jumper. On his squad’s next trip up the floor, Brown attacked from the left wing, driving up the middle and throwing down a ferocious one-handed flush to give Oklahoma State the lead and the momentum.
“I thought that dunk was just a big momentum play,” Amaker said. “I think it certainly zapped our momentum and sort of transferred it back to their team and the crowd energized. That basket, in particular, was a dagger for us.”
The Crimson was unable to recover from there, falling behind by as many as 19 and eventually losing by 17.
The loss puts an end to the most successful season in Harvard basketball history in which the Crimson captured a share of the first Ivy League title in program history.
But the 2010-11 finale, coupled with Saturday’s devastating Ivy playoff defeat, left a bad taste in the mouths of Harvard's players as they make their way back from the Midwest.
“It’s a very tough way to end the season,” Curry said. “The loss to Princeton and then this. We were definitely disappointed with the way we ended.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down 4-1 to Holy Cross with 14:05 remaining in the second period of Tuesday afternoon’s game at Soldiers Field Stadium, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team knew it needed to change things up offensively.
The squad decided to run, to make the game more fast-paced. And as it did, its number on the scoreboard began to soar. Nine unanswered goals later, the Crimson (4-1) was looking at a 10-4 victory.
“It was definitely important for us to come out and get a win,” junior attackman Jeff Cohen said. “I think Holy Cross played a tough game. They came in pretty fired up.”
After Cohen took a pass from sophomore Jack Doyle and fired it past Crusader goalie Mike Fisher to open the day's scoring 6:30 into the first quarter, Holy Cross (0-6) came roaring back with three consecutive goals in the final 3:37 of the opening period.
Sophomore midfielder John Hannan, junior midfielder Andrew Morici, and sophomore attackman James Kennedy contributed the scores for the Crusaders. Senior attackman Colin Flood added another goal just 55 seconds into the second to make it 4-1, leaving Harvard utterly confounded.
“They ran a zone, which kind of threw us a bit to start,” Cohen said. “Once we settled down, we were able to work through that to get the shots we wanted.”
Cohen cut the Holy Cross lead to 4-2 with a man-up score after Morici was penalized for being offsides. Sophomore midfielder Alex White added an unassisted goal under a minute later to bring the Crimson within 4-3.
But neither goalie would allow another score for the final 11:09 of the period, with both Fisher and Harvard sophomore Harry Krieger making a series of impressive saves.
“[Fisher] played a good game,” senior midfielder Andrew Parchman said. “A lot of our shots ended up hitting the goalie and weren’t dropping.”
In the second half, the Crimson defense came out aggressively and did not let up, shutting out the Crusader offense and allowing only 11 shots.
“Our defense and goalie played an amazing game and really kept us in it,” Parchman said.
The Harvard offense, meanwhile, continued to attack, firing 26 shots in the half. Junior defenseman Daniel DiMaria tied the game just 22 seconds into the third period by beating Fisher, and junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan put the Crimson ahead with a score two minutes later.
The Holy Cross defense contained Harvard for ten minutes, until Vaughan added his second goal with 2:50 remaining in the period. But the Crimson offense went on a late run, with Cohen adding his third score 44 seconds after Vaughan’s.
Freshman midfielder Daniel Eipp then tallied one with 30 seconds remaining in the period, and Cohen beat Fisher again with just 10 seconds left in the quarter to put Harvard up, 9-4, heading into the fourth.
“We really got out in transition a little bit, which is important against a team in a zone,” Cohen said. “We shot smart and got the shots we wanted.”
Both defenses were strong in the final period, with the only goal being scored by Crimson co-captain Dean Gibbons, who fired home his 12th of the year with seven minutes remaining in the game to give Harvard a 10-4 lead.
The Crusader offense was unable to bring it any closer than that the rest of the way. Fisher finished with 24 saves for Holy Cross, while Krieger had 11 for the Crimson.
“Harry’s gotten better each game,” Cohen said. “He’s really become a leader on our 'D,' which is obviously important for a goalie.”
Harvard finished with a large advantage in shots (45-29), ground balls (32-23), and face-offs won (13-5). Parchman was the victor in seven of those face-offs, while DiMaria paced the team with five ground balls. The Crimson only had 13 turnovers, compared to 20 for the Crusaders.
Cohen led Harvard with four goals, pushing him past Gibbons for the team lead with 13. Seven individual players had an assist for the Crimson.
After the game, Harvard was already looking ahead to its first Ancient Eight contest of the season, which will take place Saturday at Brown.
“We’re glad to get the win,” Parchman said. “We’re 4-1 going into Ivy League play. It’s a great position to be in.”

Think the rush to get your kids into Ivy League schools starts in high school? Think again.
Nicole Imprescia is suing York Avenue Preschool, a private preschool in New York, claiming that they may have damaged her four-year-old daughter's chances of getting into an elite private school.
Imprescia also alleges that the school may have hurt her daughter's chances of acceptance at an Ivy League institution such as Harvard, "citing an article that identifies preschools as the first step to 'The Ivy League,'" the New York Daily News reports.
The mother says that she enrolled her daughter at the school based on its promise to prepare students for the ERB test, which is used to place children into elite elementary schools.
Instead, the lawsuit claims, York Avenue Preschool placed her daughter in "a-two-year-old's learning environment" where she was taught shapes and colors.
The suit asks the school to reimburse the $19,000 Imprescia paid in tuition and seeks class-action status for children in a similar situation.
"Luscia Imprescia, for the record, will get into an Ivy League school, York Avenue Preschool notwithstanding," Matthew Paulose, a lawyer for the mother, told the New York Daily News.
