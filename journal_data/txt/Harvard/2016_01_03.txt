After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently translated into English, Daniel Sada’s novel “One Out of Two” adds a unique twist to the complications of the romantic comedy genre. His two protagonists, identical spinster sisters, face distance, societal expectations, and competition in their quest for love, but these issues are overshadowed by both their belief that their identities are interchangeable and the incredibly strong nature of their familial ties. Maintaining a light-hearted mood throughout, Sada uses colloquial humor, relatable characters, and colorful style to compose an enlightening and entertaining novel.
Sada begins by introducing the conundrum at hand. “Now, how to say it? One out of two, or two in one, or what?” the narrator says. This moment wittily sets the tone for the entire novel, as the identical sisters have always tried to look, act, and be the same. Having been dependent on one another since they were orphaned and taken to live with their pedantic aunt, Gloria and Constitucion Gamal are now forty-two year old spinsters in Ocampo, Mexico, who were unable and unwilling to find husbands in their youth. Things begin to change when Constitucion attends her cousin’s wedding and finds a boyfriend, Oscar Segura. Unable to stop sharing anything, the two sisters ultimately decide to share their boyfriend without his knowledge, setting the novel up for a pleasing if predictable plot. As one sister competes to kiss Oscar more than the other sister and neighbors gossip about the once antisocial women going on dates like teenagers, their boyfriend remains oblivious to the entire situation, simply hoping that Constitucion will cater to his lifelong dream of owning a small Mexican restaurant.
The simplicity of the plot does not detract from the important themes of selfhood, love, and belonging. Having always been confused for one another, the Gamals take pleasure in swapping personas—yet it seems that at some points in the novel they truly begin to believe they share one identity. Constitucion, who is referred to as “the chatterbox,” occasionally tries to be quiet to more closely resemble her sister. On the other hand, so as not to expose the fact that she lacks her sister’s beauty mark, Gloria always hides her shoulder from view. It can be challenging enough to form one’s identity in a normal situation, but Sada suggests that the addition of another identical person does nothing to make the process easier. In the end, the sisters’ need to share everything reveals a strong family tie that nothing can break: while both want to be loved by a man, neither one can bear to hurt the other. As Constitucion tells Gloria, “There are no sensible buts about it, the only thing to say is that what’s mine is yours and that’s all there is to it.”
Even as Sada devotes so much focus to the interaction between the two sisters, he also powerfully explores the effect societal pressures have upon individuals. These pressures are illustrated through the twins’ interaction with their aunt, Soledad Guadarrama, whose only advice to the girls is “get married soon and have loads of children!” Their aunt’s counsel becomes more of an annoyance as the girls mature: despite their ability to open a successful tailoring business, they are not considered successful until they have found a husband. The same could be said about their neighbors, who say, “any courtship is a downright puzzle until finally the date of the wedding can be surmised or is announced.” This maxim is especially the case for these two older women, who not only provide gossip but also are expected to snatch the opportunity to marry any man interested in them while they still have a chance. In such a setting, it is refreshing to see sisters ultimately rely on one another rather than on the men around them.
Sada successfully incorporates several complex themes into his novel, and his style is equally worthy of praise. Even though this novel was a translation from Spanish, certain distinctive elements such as the conversational syntax, small sentences, and exclamatory phrases allow Sada’s voice to shine through. In one instance, this voice emerges when Gloria kisses Oscar before her sister. “Constitucion’s response was clear, petulant: she immediately let out a chortle, which led the other to follow with her own… A concert of crows… Finally, their nervousness found an outlet, hilarity was preferable to anger, at least it was more roguish,” Sada writes. Like the sisters’ onset of laughter, the repeated use of comma and ellipses in both this quote and the rest of the novel draw one into the story by gradually adding more details to each scene. Sada’s imagery is equally vivid: ”For a moment, let us imagine—we must—the atmosphere and the rhythm framing the action, the magnetism between them: flirtatious Constitucion dimly illuminated and wearing a lovely dress with a definitive girlish touch.” Most striking, however, is the constant use of phrases that join the two sisters, such as “making them one,” “she was her equal,” “two peas in a pod,” and “the other.” These expressions reflect the degree of unity between the sisters, as the women are not even referred to by name at some points. This pattern may add to some confusion, but the disorientation seems natural as identical twins often get mistaken for one another.
“One Out of Two” offers an enjoyable experience from within the plot confines of the usual romantic triangle. The personalities of the two close sisters and the circumstances in which they find themselves feature Sada’s quirky humor, an element which renders the novel accessible to all. Using his linguistic gifts, Sada grants “One Out of Two” a universal appeal grounded in a droll, insightful voice.

Four tournaments, four top-10 finishes for Harvard wrestling co-captain Todd Preston, senior Devon Gobbo, and junior Nick Gajdzik. And this time, none were to be denied gold.
The Crimson ended 2015 on a high note, with Preston, Gobbo, and Gajdzik capturing first place finishes in their respective weight classes at the Franklin & Marshall Open in Lancaster, Penn. All three wrestlers have placed in every tournament this year, but this is the first at which any Harvard participant won.
“It’s honestly a learning curve,” Preston said. “Throughout the year, it’s a six-month season. You pick a lot along the way. I think that’s a testament to how far we’ve come this season. We started off strong. We’ve been placing guys in every single tournament in some of the toughest parts of the country.”
Preston, a senior out of Hampton, N.J., added to his team-high career win total. Competing at 141 lbs., Preston won all five of his bouts. The senior now has 16 wins on the season, tied for the most with Gajdzik, and 68 in his career. He had three pins in the opening rounds before picking up a 12-4 major decision against third-place finisher Adam Whitesell of Maryland in the semifinal. Preston went on to win a 10-1 major decision against Air Force’s Lyle Plummer in the final.
After making it to the semifinal of the season’s first tournament, the Binghamton Open, Preston went on to rack up second and sixth place finishes in other contests this season. He is ranked 10th nationally, the highest EIWA wrestler at 141.
“[Preston] is an awesome, awesome leader,” Gajdzik said. “For me, something I grew up with was leaders should always lead by example. You follow someone because they’re somebody you aspire to be like, and Todd fits that definition to an absolute T. You ask somebody who is the hardest working guy in the room, it’s Todd.”
Gajdzik, the team’s lone heavyweight participant, captured the title by earning a fall against Christian Colucci of Lehigh in 2:01. The junior started with a 7-1 decision against Millersville’s David Wuestner before knocking off host Franklin and Marshall’s Andrew Pelusi and Navy’s Thomas Ott.
In a six minute and 50 second-long match, Gobbo pinned Austin Rose of Drexel University to also win first place. Gobbo is ranked 20th nationally at 165, the second-highest rank for an EIWA wrestler. Gobbo has the second most wins on the team with 13 and boasts a career total of 40 victories.
“[Gajdzik and Gobbo are] very good wrestlers, great leaders on the team, and that’s what they did yesterday. They stepped up big and they got first place,” Preston said. “That’s exactly what we want them to do, especially in front of the younger guys. We have high goals. We want to be a top-15 team, and in order to do that, we have to be placing guys and having chances at almost every single tournament.”
Nine other Harvard wrestlers placed in the top four at the tournament. Junior Jeffrey Ott at 133, sophomore Tyler Tarsi at 157, sophomore Josef Johnson at 174, and senior Michael Mocco at 184 captured second-place finishes in their weight classes. Freshman Ryan Friedman at 133 and sophomore Logan Kirby at 184 took home third-place finishes, while freshman Nolan Hellickson at 125 and senior Patrick Hogan at 149 each finished fourth.
This was the first of seven team matches over the course of the break. While most other students are at home or on vacation, the wrestling team is back in Cambridge.
“We had an excellent preseason, and from there, that just kind of set the tone throughout for how the entire season has been,” Gajdzik said. “We’ve all been working as hard as possible, and we really can start to see those results coming to fruition now in the tournament like the one we just had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing off against Stony Brook for the first time in 10 years, the Harvard women’s basketball dropped a close one, 64-63, to the Seawolves on the road on Wednesday. Despite a strong shooting night from the Crimson (4-7), Stony Brook (8-5) came away with a victory after freshman guard Davion Wingate split a pair of free throws with three seconds remaining to give her side a one-point edge.
Looking to end a three-game Seawolves' winning streak, the Crimson struggled late. Following a 21-point second quarter, Harvard struggled to get boards in the latter stages of the game, as Stony Brook outrebounded the Crimson 23-11, in the second half.
Yet, after trading shots and free throws for much of the fourth quarter, Harvard found itself down by three late in the fourth before freshman guard Sydney Skinner pulled up from deep to tie things up at 62 with less than three minutes left on the clock.
But for the next few minutes, neither team would register a field goal, as Harvard and Stony Brook would earn the game’s final three points from the line. Both sides earned four attempts, with the Crimson hitting one and the Seawolves converting two.
“I was pretty happy with our defense on the last possession and at the end,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It was tied, and at the end of the 30-second clock, a kid drove and they got the call.”
Despite the loss, the Crimson shot over 40 percent both from the field and from beyond the arc for the first time this season. The senior trio of Shilpa Tummala, AnnMarie Healy, and Kit Metoyer combined for 39 points, while freshman guard Nani Redford put up a season-high nine.
Despite the high shooting percentage, Harvard’s struggles in the paint continued. After putting up only six points in the paint against Fairfield on Monday, the Crimson nearly tripled that amount to 16, only to fall short to Stony Brook’s 32.
“Something we’re working on is consistency and being full-time players,” Healy said.
The two teams traded blows for much of the first half. After Harvard went up 7-3 early in the first quarter, the Seawolves responded with a 9-0 run before the Crimson could respond with a jumper from Healy. Despite falling behind following the Stony Brook run, Redford closed the quarter with a layup and a three-pointer to pull Harvard within three at 17-14.
After trailing for much of the first, the Crimson exploded for 21 points in the second, with Metoyer scoring all of her 12 points in the quarter on four-of-four shooting from beyond the arc. The barrage of threes gave Harvard a 35-30 advantage going into the half.
After going 5-of-8 from beyond the arc in the second quarter, however, the Crimson’s offense struggled in the third period. Turning the ball over four times and going 0-of-5 from beyond the arc, Harvard only managed to put up 12 points in the frame.
Furthermore, the struggles at the free throw line continued. After shooting 74 percent from the charity stripe last year, the Crimson shot only 10-of-18 from the line on Wednesday, closing out the fourth quarter with three misses in a row.
“The breakdown fell at the tail end of the 30-second clock a number of times, and then they hurt us really bad on the offensive boards,” Delaney-Smith said. “It come down to rebounding and foul-shots—we did not shoot our foul shots very well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Men’s Basketball beat writer David Freed highlights three things to watch ahead of Harvard’s matinee with Vermont (2:00 PM EST). The Crimson (6-7) looks to get to .500 on the season after winning four of its last five games. 
BENCH AND BALANCE
As the calendar turns to January, it typically means two things for Harvard: the beginning of Ivy League play and the shortening of the rotation. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker typically plays just two or three players off the bench each game, preferring to rely heavily on his starters in a conference where (cliché alert!) every game matters.
During this spell, he constantly preaches the need for both “bench and balance.” Fittingly, after the departure of four starters and the team’s most trusted reserve, Harvard has better balance (and bench play) this year than last. While junior Zena Edosomwan—like Wesley Saunders ’15 a year ago—is the clear offensive focal point, six other Crimson players average between seven and 10 points a contest.
The depth and balance has allowed Amaker to mix and match lineups all year. No player averages more than 30 minutes a game, but seven average more than 20, leading to improved flexibility. Not three weeks after using a three-freshman lineup down the stretch against Kansas, Harvard played five upperclassmen for the majority of the second half against Oklahoma. Against Vermont, a team that plays a lengthy nine-man rotation and pushes the pace, Harvard’s depth will come in handy.
CONTRAST OF STYLES
Thrice at the Diamond Head Classic in Hawaii, the Crimson found itself playing an opponent that liked to run. When Harvard controlled the pace, it surged—taking a 19-3 lead against BYU, dominating Auburn, and leading Oklahoma at half. When the game turned into a track meet, the Crimson’s penchant for live ball turnovers caught up with them. The dichotomy will be a theme in nearly every Harvard contest of the year as the team currently plays at the 276th pace in the nation, per KenPom. Vermont is a good match for the Crimson, as it turns opponents over under 12 times a game and registers just 5.3 steals a game. Both marks are outside the top 250 nationally and good signs for a Crimson team that occasionally has problems taking care of the ball.
THE CHATFIELD CONUNDRUM
After struggling with injury for a month, sophomore Andre Chatfield returned to the lineup against Wofford and registered only two fouls in nine minutes. Barring health complications, his reintroduction to the lineup poses interesting questions for Amaker. Senior Patrick Steeves has taken over Chatfield’s role and excelled, averaging nearly eight points and three assists while shooting 48 percent from three in just 20 minutes a game. With the rotation shortening, Chatfield and classmate Chris Egi—the team’s first big off the bench—are at risk of being cut to the fringes. Vermont will be a chance to see if Amaker is dedicated to continuing to give them playing time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MINNEAPOLIS—Kyle Criscuolo, co-captain of the Harvard men’s hockey team, stands just 5 feet 9 inches tall. But with the 25th annual Mariucci Classic on the line Saturday night, it was the Crimson’s shortest skater who rose the highest.
Clinging onto the 3-2 lead it seized late in the third period, Minnesota—the host of the historic holiday tournament—won the biggest faceoff of the night with less than a minute to go, prompting junior defenseman Jake Bischoff to grab the puck and immediately fire it up the boards.
But using every last inch of his 5’9” frame, Criscuolo left his feet in front of the Gopher bench, elevating just high enough to bring down the puck and maintain the zone with the clock winding down in the championship game.
“The guys on the bench were saying I got up pretty high there,” Criscuolo joked.
Following the co-captain’s high-flying act, Harvard’s six-man attack went to work. Criscuolo navigated his way to the right post, where he stuffed home a feed from senior forward Jimmy Vesey, tying the game with just 34 seconds to go. Then in the overtime period that ensued, the two co-captains reproduced their magic, as Vesey spotted his linemate on a 3-on-2, and Criscuolo beat the goaltender to lift the No. 7/7 Crimson (8-1-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) to a 4-3 triumph and its first Mariucci Classic title in school history.
“Those are the situations you want to be in,” Vesey said. “And that’s what makes us better—playing in games like that, being down like that, having to come back…. The guys definitely stayed up, stayed positive, and basically just found a way to get it done.”
Not long after having two of his own shots stopped by Minnesota goaltender Eric Schierhorn, Vesey created the space necessary to feed Criscuolo at the end of regulation by inching toward the netminder along the end line.
Vesey’s approach drew junior defenseman Michael Brodzinski, who had been jockeying for position with Criscuolo, away from the far post, allowing Vesey to slide the puck over to the second-year captain. And despite making more contact with Gopher forward Hudson Fasching’s stick than the puck, Criscuolo forced it to trickle through.
Then in overtime, Harvard’s championship-clinching score materialized thanks to yet another play that will not show up on the box score.
Minnesota (8-9-0, 3-1-0 Big 10) tried to open the extra frame as the aggressor, just like it did in the first three periods. And two minutes in, they looked poised to break out on a 4-on-2. But just as the Gophers aimed to get the puck to an open Bischoff, freshman forward Jacob Olson—a Saint Paul, Minn., native—thwarted the opportunity with a poke of his stick, sending the Crimson off to the races in the opposite direction.
“He really made a great play with his Stretch Armstrong reach,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Then we got the puck in the hands of some pretty talented guys, and they were able to finish it off.”
Junior forward Alex Kerfoot entered the attacking zone along the left wing with Criscuolo on his right, then dropped a pass off for Vesey trailing the play. Rather than shoot, however, Vesey passed the puck over to Criscuolo, who lifted the puck over a sprawling Schierhorn to clinch the title.
“[Jimmy] said he definitely knew that he could beat this goalie,” the tournament's Most Valuable Player recalled. "And I told him, ‘I’ll be right around the net.’"
"I knew he was going to feed it to me, and I knew that the goalie was going to be thinking Jim’s going to shoot—he’s such a lethal shooter," Criscuolo continued. "I was hoping just to get it on net as quick as I could because I knew the goalie wouldn’t be in great position.”
The Crimson led for the near-entirety of the game after junior forward Sean Malone ripped Harvard’s first shot of the night past Schierhorn on the doorstep 2:04 into the contest. But the Crimson would require Criscuolo’s heroics after the hosts exploded for two goals in 28 seconds—one from Leon Bristedt and another from Steve Johnson—to jump ahead late in the third period.
Johnson’s goal, the first of the sophomore defenseman’s career, marked the third unanswered strike for Minnesota, who kicked its comeback into gear with just 19 seconds remaining in the second period when Brodzinski beat Madsen glove-side.
For the first 39 minutes, the sophomore goaltender had completely shut the door on the Gophers, despite Minnesota commanding the Harvard zone for much of the night. Madsen finished with 26 saves—21 over the first two periods—perhaps none bigger than a glove save to rob Tommy Novak on his left post during a Gopher power play in the first period.
But despite Madsen’s efforts, Minnesota finally blew the roof off the building with six minutes to go in the third. First, Fasching launched Bristedt on a break up the left wing, and after cutting to the net, the Swedish product beat Madsen five-hole with a nifty move to his backhand. Then Johnson sent the crowd into a total frenzy, converting from the slot at 14:29.
Yet, two Criscuolo goals later, the Crimson emerged with its first Mariucci Classic championship in four tries and its first victory on the road against the Gophers since 1950.
“This is a big win for us, and a historic one for the program,” Vesey said.
“This was the game we wanted to play in—a full house against Minnesota,” he added. “I think we grew a lot as a team from playing in that game…. I think this bodes really well for us in the long run.”
