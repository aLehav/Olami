After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s that time of year again! Awards season is nigh, with the Oscars just around the corner on March 2nd. But with a panel made up of primarily white, elderly males who tend to vote similarly, it can be hard to add a little spice and surprise to the Oscar nominations. Nevertheless, a little Oscar buzz is good for that lazy post-Wintersession soul.
 
The Main (re: Most Interesting) Categories: 
 
Best Picture: 12 Years a Slave
Nominees: 12 Years a Slave, The Wolf of Wall Street, Captain Phillips, Her, American Hustle, Gravity, Dallas Buyers Club, Nebraska, and Philomena. 
The most surprising nominations in this category would have to be American Hustle and The Wolf of Wall Street. While entertaining, neither movie was the best to come out this year. 
 
Best Director: Steven McQueen 
Nominees: Steve McQueen (12 Years a Slave), David O. Russell (American Hustle), Alfonso Cuaron (Gravity), Alexander Payne (Nebraska), and Martin Scorsese (The Wolf of Wall Street)
There’s no doubt about it—The Academy loves David O. Russell this year. Despite producing an unmemorable (albeit entertaining) American Hustle, the director got the nomination, in spite of being passed over for some of his superior films. 
 
Best Actor: Matthew McConaughey or Chiwetel Ejiofor
Nominees: Bruce Dern (Nebraska), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Matthew McConaughey (Dallas Buyers Club), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Wolf of Wall Street), and Christian Bale (American Hustle). 
From rom-com dreamboat to heavyweight actor, Matthew McConaughey was full of surprises this year in Dallas Buyers Club. Maybe he’ll be rewarded for coming such a long way? Chiwetel Ejiofor is also a strong contender here, but while many clamor for Leo to finally win the Oscar he so deserves, I don’t believe his work in The Wolf of Wall Street merits it—unless The Academy were to use it as a nod to all the masterful performances he has given to date.  
 
Best Actress: Cate Blanchett
Nominees: Amy Adams (American Hustle), Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine), Judi Dench (Philomena), Sandra Bullock (Gravity), and Meryl Streep (August: Osage County). 
 If you thought you’d seen the last of Cate Blanchett, prepare to be floored by her performance in Blue Jasmine. Someone, give this woman a golden trophy already! Oh wait, the Golden Globes already did...another! 
 
Best Supporting Actor: Jared Leto 
Nominees: Barkhad Abdi (Captain Phillips), Bradley Cooper (American Hustle), Jonah Hill (The Wolf of Wall Street), Jared Leto (Dallas Buyers Club), and Michael Fassbender (12 Years a Slave). 
Why is Jonah Hill even nominated? Sometimes you look at the Oscars and want to shake your head in disbelief. Perhaps most at the forefront of this race is the talented Jared Leto, as seen by his success at other award ceremonies.
 
Best Supporting Actress: Lupita Nyong’o
Nominees: Jennifer Lawrence (American Hustle), Lupita Nyong'o (12 Years a Slave), June Squibb (Nebraska), Julia Roberts (August: Osage County), and Sally Hawkins (Blue Jasmine).
Please do not repeat the injustice of the Golden Globes! At the prior award ceremony, Lupita Nyong’o was passed over in favor of sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence. And while Lawrence is still spastically wonderful, her performance cannot compare to the masterpiece that was Lupita Nyong’o in 12 Years A Slave. Nevertheless, all of the nominees in this category have truly earned their places, with nuanced and gripping performances across the board. 
 
Best Visual Effects: Gravity
Nominees: Gravity, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug, Star Trek Into Darkness, Iron Man 3, and The Lone Ranger. 
 Gravity will likely get the nod—no surprise there. Star Trek with it's blinding lens flares doesn't stand a chance.
 
Best Short Film (animated): Room on the Broom
Nominees: Feral, Get a Horse!, Mr. Hublot, Possessions, and Room on the Broom.
 If this isn’t one of your favorite categories, I don’t know what rock you’ve been living under, but you need to come out and bask in the magic. Here, artists unknown to mainstream moviegoers shine in the perfect pearls of cinematography they produce. They capture your heart, make you a little hungry, and amaze you with what they are capable of achieving on a computer.

Harvard’s efforts to encourage an atmosphere of academic honesty took a major step Tuesday with the unveiling of the Honor Code draft. The short, one-and-a-half page document includes two important new policies. First, it calls for students to sign an “affirmation to integrity” before major examinations; and second, it creates a joint student-faculty “honor board” to oversee cases involving academic dishonesty.
 
These are positive developments toward fostering a culture of academic honesty at the College. Over time, we hope that they will help to create a community that better upholds the ideals of honesty and integrity. The declaration of integrity—which requires students to “attest to the honesty of [their] academic work and affirm that it conforms to the standards of the Harvard College Honor Code”—will have to be signed before every major test and paper. It should serve as a reminder of the importance and value of academic integrity at the times in which cheating is most tempting. Far from meaningless talk, the honor code and declaration can have a positive psychological impact by reminding each student of the culture of academic honesty and integrity to which we all should strive.  And at the very least, a declaration of integrity is unlikely to have any negative effects on academic honesty.
 
The second major announcement was the creation of a new honor board, which will include both student and faculty members and hear cases of academic dishonesty. We applaud this effort to engage the student perspective in the disciplinary process. Having students on the honor board not only makes the process more transparent to the student body but also gives those with the best knowledge of the infractions at hand—current students—a say in the correct punitive measures. Judgment before one’s peers can also be a deterrent to potential cheaters.
 As the process of drafting an honor code moves along, we hope that students continue to have an active voice in the process. As we opined in April, an honor code shaped by the student body moves the moral responsibility of academic dishonesty away from the administration and onto the students. The development of a declaration and honor board puts more onus on student judgment and decision-making. We welcome these steps as Harvard moves forward in discussing academic integrity, and in developing a culture that sustains it.

“I don’t think [marijuana] is more dangerous than alcohol,” President Obama recently said in an interview with the New Yorker.
He went on to talk about how pot was actually less dangerous than alcohol for the individual consumer, drawing from his own personal pot usage during his childhood—“I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 2 a.m,” he memorably joked at the 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner—but he stressed that pot was “not something [he] encourages.”
When asked about his plan for marijuana in the remaining three years of his second term, Obama discussed rectifying the current laws that unfairly punish what he views as an activity “some of the folks who are writing those laws have probably done.” Yet just two days later, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney reiterated that Obama’s stance on the legality of marijuana has not changed, and that the current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 is not going to be altered.
While I applaud President Obama’s move toward reducing the harsh penalties slapped upon a victimless, non-violent crime, I am perplexed by his refusal to change marijuana’s current schedule status. In fact, the entire drug classification system is archaic, unscientific, and rather harmful.
The Controlled Substances Act, signed into law by Richard Nixon, classifies certain drugs into one of five “schedules,” each with a varying set of criteria, ordered in descending severity. A Schedule I drug is defined as a “substance [that] has a high potential for abuse … has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,” and for which there exists no “accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.”
As the schedule number increases, the potential for abuse is supposed to decrease and the perceived physical and psychological dependencies are judged less severe—increasing the likelihood for medical use of the drugs.
Hopefully, many issues are already apparent. Primarily, why are drugs such as marijuana, LSD (acid), and MDMA (ecstasy) classified as Schedule I? Potential medical usage alone is enough to bump a drug from Schedule I to Schedule II.
For decades, researchers have known of the beneficial psychiatric effects of LSD as well as its anxiety-reducing and alcoholism-fighting properties. Recent research into MDMA has yielded promising results in controlling substance abuse and treating post-traumatic stress disorder. Twenty states, from Alaska to Washington, have approved medical marijuana usage for reasons such as chronic pain relief, nausea reduction, and possible anti-tumor effects. This is not even to mention the fact that studies have shown both LSD and marijuana to be less addictive, psychologically and physiologically, than alcohol.
The current CSA schedule for drugs is broken. A glance at the history of how drugs have been classified is enough to show that the system is far from flawless. When the CSA was first created, marijuana was put in Schedule I as a temporary measure simply due to the lack of rigorous scientific study into its effects. 
President Nixon then created the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse—commonly called the Shafer Commission after its chairman—to extensively study marijuana and its health impacts. Two years later, in 1972, Raymond Shafer delivered a report titled “Marihuana, A Signal of Misunderstanding,” which concluded after widespread study that marijuana had “little proven danger of physical or psychological harm” and that decriminalization of the drug was not only strongly recommended but also possibly constitutionally required. Nixon ignored all recommendations from the commission. The current classification of marijuana is, in every sense of the word, a mistake.
LSD and MDMA have similar stories. The two were classified as Schedule I drugs due to political haste with no regard to scientific evidence—MDMA’s classification was intended to be temporary as well!
The impact of these incorrect classifications goes far past the wants of recreational drug users and their weekend activities. These drugs, with their aforementioned medicinal usages, could aid millions who are suffering from pain and various psychiatric disorders in the United States alone. 
However, with their current legal statuses, not only are the drugs illegal to use medicinally by federal law, but research is also extremely difficult to conduct due to a lack of federal funding and the difficulty obtaining legal licenses for human trials. In fact, the director of the Drug Enforcement Agency’s job description states that he or she “shall ensure that no Federal funds … shall be expended for any study … of a substance listed in Schedule I.” 
I urge President Obama, along with Congress, to publicly recognize the flaws within the CSA and to remedy them as soon as possible. Multiple solutions are available. The simplest to implement would be to address the overwhelming scientific evidence on the benefits of various drugs such as marijuana, LSD, and MDMA, and reschedule them appropriately. 
A more ideal, albeit more complex, solution would be to understand that not all drugs can be pigeonholed into a rigid three-pronged classification and allow for drugs to exist outside of the CSA schedule under more specialized laws.
This country needs to inject some sense into its drug laws. With an understanding president and unprecedented public support in the states, that time is now.

We’re standing around the common room of a first floor dorm, a couple people sprawled out on the couch, one standing by the dresser. I’m perched on a desk, and the whole room bursts out into laughter at a physics joke. One girl sighs, “Where else would this conversation happen but at Harvard?”
 
It’s true—thoughtful, intellectually stimulating conversations happen on a daily basis at Harvard. In the dining halls, around seminar discussion tables, and on common room couches, meaningful conversation abounds around campus. The fallacy, however, lies in assuming that Harvard is the only place that these conversations can be found.
 
It’s remarkable that Harvard students are frantically crafting novels in their dorm rooms or running venture capital firms from dining halls. But just as many students our age have similar aspirations with similar, if not greater, accomplishments. A student from the University of Maryland has founded the largest student voice network in the country; a Vanderbilt student invented an algae-fueled carbon dioxide converter. Harvard is not the sole incubator of accomplished young people.
 
Nor is it the only home of kindred spirits. Would any of us write off our conversations with friends and acquaintances from the 18 years before we entered college as trite, shallow, and meaningless? Some of my deepest friendships were forged at high school sleepovers, munching on muffins at midnight, discussing philosophies covered in A.P. European History. People like the friends we bonded with in high school are all over the country, from small liberal arts colleges to large state schools. Those kindred spirits continue to exist in the present, beyond Harvard’s walls.
 
Too often, I see appreciation of Harvard’s history and academic excellence mistranslated into a sense of personal uniqueness. While Harvard as a university might be unparalleled in its age, endowment, and resources offered, each of us individually is not somehow transitively bestowed with superior intelligence and likelihood of success (much less conversational skills).
 
Despite being surrounded by accomplished peers on a daily basis, there’s no need to massage our self-esteem by dusting off our feathers and announcing our alleged superiority to the outside world. Yes, there are winners of worldwide science competitions living in close proximity to us, but there are also winners of worldwide science competitions outside of Harvard and undiscovered scientific geniuses whom we have yet to meet. Perhaps instead of praising the admissions process that filtered us in along with giants, a simple acknowledgement that we have more to learn and more people to learn from would suffice.
 
Lastly, lauding the distinctiveness of Harvard and disparaging the outside world will only leave us in the dust at graduation. No matter how fantastic Harvard is, the fact remains that at the end of four years, we have to depart and enter the real world. It’s a flat-out lie that once we throw our caps in the air, we bid goodbye to all philosophy and meaning and intellectual stimulation.
 
Only with some humility—and a healthy dose of reality—can we look around at the accomplishments of our classmates and truly treasure those meaningful late-night conversations. We can admire our peers’ accomplishments and hard work without viewing it as an earmark of the categorical superiority of the students selected to attend Harvard. By recognizing that interesting people exist both inside and outside Harvard, we not only allow each individual his or her fair share of respect but also save ourselves from approximately 60 years of spiritual loneliness after graduation.
 
I have faith that even after I graduate, there will be kindred spirits and late-night conversations to sate the soul. I also believe that my best friends in high school, the ones with whom I snacked on muffins while hashing out our rudimentary understanding of Hobbes at age 15, are having equally rewarding and meaningful discussions at Georgetown and Kenyon and colleges across the country. At Harvard—but not only at Harvard—the whole room can burst into laughter at something as humble as a physics joke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The late Nabisco CEO Robert Schaeberle once said, “If we could ever make red tape nutritional, we could feed the world.” After trying (and categorically failing) to open a crepe cart business in Boston last summer, I sympathize with him. Bureaucratic red tape can leave us all hungry.
Running a crepe company seemed pretty straightforward. With two friends, I would prepare the batter at my house each morning. The ingredients are cheap—mainly egg, flour, milk, and sugar. When ready, we would wheel a food cart out of my garage and take it to Boston Common, Copley Square, or another location in Boston. There we would make the crepes with an electric crepe-maker and serve them with an assortment of toppings: banana, sugar, Nutella, and more.
 
While production costs for crepes are low, fixed costs are a bit pricy. After purchasing a food cart (about $700), a crepe-maker (about $50), permits, and other expenses, we expected start-up costs to total around $1,000 to $1,200. Still, we remained undeterred. With one-for-$3 and two-for-$5 deals, variety in toppings, great taste, and super witty name—A la Cart—we expected to turn a profit within 45 days.
 
If only it were that easy.
 
After visiting Boston City Hall, Food Safety, and the Parks and Recreation Department, it became clear that our business plan had serious flaws. To begin, food vendors must be stationary in Boston. Companies are only given permits for a single location and are barred from moving sites. This restrictive statute turned out to be the least of our concerns as we settled on operating solely in Boston Common.
 
The plan really began to unravel at Food Safety. The inspector told me that crepes—along with pancakes and waffles—fall under the “Belgian-style eatery” category, which seems like a poor classification name for a French food. More importantly for us, it meant we fell under a host of regulations—all neatly outlined in a 30-page packet—including the requirement to have a sink onsite. This applied despite all our food preparation occurring offsite. I have never seen a crepe cart with a sink before, perhaps in part because sink-attached carts cost an egregious $2,500 or more.
 
To further complicate things, I was told that food must be prepared at an established restaurant or an approved kitchen—my house would never qualify according to the Food Safety inspector. While I understand the logic, this requirement basically prevents any individual food vendor from establishing a business. Food Safety also mandates carts be stored overnight in an approved facility—my garage also failed to pass muster. This rule appears redundant as carts already undergo routine inspections for cleanliness.
 
The number of permits, and the process of obtaining them, stunned me. To operate a crepe cart in Boston Common, you need permits from Boston Food Safety, Massachusetts Food Safety, Boston Parks and Recreation (which has jurisdiction over the Common), the Boys and Girls Club of Boston (which administers activity in the Common), the Boston Licensing Department, and Boston Public Works. There are probably more, but we never made it that far.
 
Beyond the cost of each permit (some ran into the hundreds of dollars) was the time the entire process would have taken. It’s sequential—you need a permit from one before you can begin the process for another. Food Safety permits predicate everything, which makes sense, but even the licensing process, for example, cannot begin before clearance from Public Works. It would have taken several months before we could make our first crepe. That’s ridiculous.
 
This problem is not contained to the Boston mobile food industry, of course. To open a new restaurant in New York, for example, requires some 30 permits from 11 different government bodies.
 
I believe in government regulation. We don’t want people recklessly selling food on the side of the road. It endangers our health and trust in the food industry. Government policy, however, should focus on lessening barriers to entry. We should be encouraging new companies to enter markets, not shutting them out. New companies create competition, jobs, and ultimately benefit the entire economy, but complex and burdensome permitting processes prevent many companies from ever getting off their feet. We need to decrease regulatory obstacles that discourage businesses from trying.
 
Reducing barriers to entry should include consolidation of permitting to fewer government bodies and reduction of needless regulation. Requiring companies to go through many agencies, as with the mobile food industry, drags out the process, creates large opportunity costs, and disincentives new firms. Decreasing permitting agencies helps entrepreneurs and reduces bureaucratic costs. Policy should also reduce unnecessary requirements like the need for a sink and for an approved cart storage location.
 
It’s time to improve the permitting process and start making crepes.

The U.S. Justice Department announced Thursday that prosecutors will seek the death penalty for Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev if he is convicted for his alleged role in the 2013 bombings at the Boston Marathon and the ensuing manhunt that shut down much of the greater Boston Area, including Cambridge, last April.
Tsarnaev, at one time a lifeguard at the Malkin Athletic Complex and Cambridge resident, is being tried on 30 counts, 17 of which are punishable by the death penalty in the event of conviction. The Justice Department, which indicted Tsarnaev on June 27, 2013, is pursuing the death penalty on only six counts.
“After consideration of the relevant facts, the applicable regulations and the submissions made by the defendant’s counsel, I have determined that the United States will seek the death penalty in this matter,” U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said in a statement. “The nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision.”
A trial date has not been set for Tsarnaev, though Holder’s decision allows the U.S. Attorney’s office in Massachusetts to proceed in its scheduling. The Justice Department could decide to drop the pursuit of the death penalty after the trial.
On April 15, Tsarnaev, 20, and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who died in a subsequent manhunt, allegedly detonated two bombs that, together, killed three people at the finish line of the Boston Marathon and injured more than 260. Among those killed in the bombings was Krystle M. Campbell, a former Harvard Business School employee.
 
Three days after the bombing, MIT police officer Sean Collier was shot and killed in an alleged firefight with the Tsarnaev brothers. After the brothers fled the scene, police launched a manhunt and an area-wide lockdown that remained in effect throughout a prolonged standoff between the Tsarnaev brothers and police. Harvard remained closed during the duration of the manhunt.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed after being shot by police and then run over by an SUV allegedly driven by his brother, who was trying to escape the scene. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended by authorities in Watertown on the evening of April 19, almost 20 hours after the manhunt began.

Presidential Election Day may be more than two years away, but in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton leads among possible candidates in the Democratic primary race at unprecedented levels, while Republicans remain split between their party's potential candidates, according to polling firm Purple Strategies.
A panel of experts from the company were hosted at the Institute of Politics Thursday afternoon to share insights into the 2016 presidential race and the 2014 New Hampshire U.S. Senate race.
The poll found that New Hampshire voters were generally dissatisfied with many possible presidential candiates. Overall, all potential candidates analyzed in the poll—Clinton, N.J. Governor Chris Christie, former Fl. Governor Jeb Bush, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vice President Joe Biden, La. Governor Bobby Jindal, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, former Mass. Governor Mitt Romney, and U.S. Senator Rand Paul—received more unfavorable ratings than favorable ones.
All the possible candidates received below a 45-percent favorability rating and received net unfavorable ratings from independents with the exception of Paul, who received a 35-percent favorable and a 34-percent unfavorable rating.
“I think one thing that’s incredibly notable is how much people in New Hampshire dislike everybody running for office,” said Doug Usher, managing partner for Purple Insights, the research division of Purple Strategies. “We have a very sour electorate about everything that’s going on.”
The poll demonstrated differing sentiments among Democrats and Republicans regarding their party’s potential candidates. New Hampshire Democrats overwhelmingly favor Clinton above others, with a 88 percent favorable to five percent unfavorable rating. Biden and Warren had favorability ratings of 70 percent and 61 percent, respectively, and unfavorability ratings of 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively.
“These numbers mean virtually nobody else gets in the race because of them,” said James Demers, managing partner of Purple Strategies New England. “She has frozen the field.”
By contrast, Republicans’ support of possible candidates is less pronounced. Leading the party is Mitt Romney, who received a 72 percent favorability rating from New Hampshire GOP voters. However, Alex Castellanos, founding partner of Purple Strategies, believes Romney’s popularity comes from an incomplete Republican field.
“You can look at this as if Mitt Romney is almost a parking lot right now,” Castellanos said. “Our candidates aren’t right yet, and I think a lot of people are sitting idly in the Mitt Romney parking lot.”
Behind Mitt Romney, who has said multiple times that he will not enter the race, Bush leads among GOP voters, with a 59 percent favorable and 15 percent unfavorable rating. Paul and Christie are “essentially tied” for third place, according to the PurplePoll report, with favorability ratings of 53 percent and 48 percent, and unfavorability ratings of 16 percent and 30 percent, respectively.
The lack of focused support for any potential Republican candidate in the field suggests brand issues among the perceived field of candidates and the possibility for other Republicans to enter the race, according to experts.
The poll also reflected a gender gap within the electorate, with Clinton leading among women by 14 points but trailing by 13 points among men. The poll also showed that Clinton holds slight advantages over Christie and Bush in a general election test.

Wearing a fur-trimmed white hat and black leather gloves, award-winning British actress Helen Mirren—Hasty Pudding Theatricals' Woman of the Year—waved and smiled at the crowd lining Massachusetts Ave., as she and members of the Pudding cast paraded through the streets of Harvard Square.
Mirren’s acting career, spanning decades, has earned her an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, and four Emmy wins for her numerous film and theater performances from “The Queen” to “Gosford Park.”
She joined an elite group of previous Woman of the Year recipients including actresses Meryl Streep, Halle Berry, Claire Danes, and last year’s winner Marion Cotillard.
After the parade, Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Tony T. Oblen ’14 and Vice President Ethan D. Hardy ’14 officiated a celebratory roast of the actress in Farkas Hall, the home of the Pudding Theatricals. Pudding cast members played charades with Mirren, competed against her in a trivia game entitled “Are you Smarter Than Helen Mirren?”, and presented her a nerf gun to shoot at photos of the many awards she has earned throughout her career.
The audience in Farkas Hall laughed and applauded as Mirren acted out her final charade clue, “Twerking.” During a press conference after the roast, Mirren remarked that she had only ever practiced “twerking” in her bedroom.
Hasty Pudding cast members dressed as various reincarnations of Mirren’s previous roles and co-stars, including Al Pacino and Nicholas Cage.
In their welcoming speech, Oblen and Hardy introduced Mirren, known for her portrayal of three different British queens, as “the only British actress not in the Harry Potter series.”
When Mirren took the stage, she humorously described her trip to Harvard as “a ghastly experience.”
At the press conference following the roast, Mirren addressed the role of women in film.
“You don’t worry about roles for women in drama,” she said. “If there are great roles for women in life, then there will be great roles for women in drama.”
Following the presentation of the traditional Pudding Pot, several Hasty Pudding cast members performed a sample of musical numbers from their 166th production, “Victorian Secrets.”
Despite the cold, onlookers lined the sidewalks of Mass. Ave. to catch a glimpse of Mirren. During the procession, representatives from local radio stations handed out free t-shirts, a b.good food truck advertised free milkshakes, and Shake Shack employees distributed coupons for free frozen custard.
“I was really excited about it because she’s one of my favorite actresses,” said Lejla Skokic ’17, who attended the parade. “I’m so glad I was able to come to the parade today and actually see her in person. The crowd was huge and people were freaking out to see her.”

Harvard Student Agencies—the College’s largest student-run corporation—will implement an organization-wide minimum wage-raise at the beginning of the its fiscal year on Saturday, Feb. 1. The new policy, which will increase starting pay to $12 from $1o for all hourly workers, impacts more than 100 current HSA employees.
HSA President Ryley R. Reynolds ’15 said that the corporation made raising starting pay a priority during the budget process over the past few months in accordance with its mission.
“Most people don’t know this about us, but we’re a nonprofit: our goal is to employ students and offer them business experience,” she said. “And, as I like to say, to give Harvard students agency.”
According to Reynolds, the new policy will most affect students employed by HSA Cleaners and The Harvard Shop. Staff of other agencies, such as HSA tutoring, already receive starting compensation above the new $12 per hour minimum.
HSA employs approximately 450 students annually across its 14 business units, which include HSA Dorm Essentials, the Let’s Go travel guide, and the Harvard Bartending Course. In total, the company brings in roughly $4 million in revenue each year, according to its website. It only employs Harvard students.
“We say that HSA provides quality work with quality pay, and that is definitely true,” said Ali N. Bayar ’15, managing director of The Harvard Shop.
According to HSA Cleaners Managing Director Michael D. Julian ’15, all employees were notified of the change by email on Wednesday. Some workers who were present in the store that day were informed in-person.
“We have awesome employees, and I think this is a great way to show our appreciation for all the hard work they do,” Julian said.
“I am, of course, very excited about the raise,” Kristina Arakelyan ’14, a sales associate at The Harvard Shop, wrote in an email.
Reynolds emphasized HSA’s high wage as an incentive for students to seek employment at HSA in lieu of work at other institutions in the Square.
"Massachusetts’s minimum wage is only $8,” she said.
Arakelyan echoed Reynolds’ sentiments. “I hope that the more competitive salary will encourage more students to become members of this wonderfully close-knit student-run organization,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Nine months after its opening ceremony was delayed by the Boston Marathon Bombings, the Instituto Cervantes—a research centered devoted to Hispanic culture and the Spanish language—held an open house to officially celebrate its founding.
 
The Instituto Cervantes, a non-profit created by the Spanish government, operates branches in over 20 countries with 54 centers in total. The institute's Harvard branch, or “observatory,” focuses on research of the Spanish language in the United States.
 
According to Diana Sorensen, dean of Arts and Humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the observatory was originally set to hold its official opening last April, but it was postponed due to the bombings. Since then, she said, the Institute has made up for its “false start” by celebrating in stages.
 
“The celebration has to do with the presence of the Spanish language and the Hispanic cultures in the United States and what that means at Harvard,” Sorensen said. “We hope that this will be a convening place for all of you who are interested in a hyphenated identity of Hispanic-American or Latin-American or Latino—the names themselves are tellingly diverse.”
 
The observatory seeks to foster dialogue between members of the community and to explore the development of Spanish language and culture in both the Harvard community and the United States as a whole, according to Francisco Moreno-Fernandez, its executive director.
 
“We are doing some research and studies on reports and we will present the results of these reports to the Harvard community,” he said, adding that the institute will gather information about Spanish language and culture through conversations with members of the community, including students and faculty.
 
At the open house at the observatory’s offices at 2 Arrow St., Moreno-Fernandez gave a lecture about the international importance of the Spanish language and a video report about the opening of the observatory at Harvard by a Spanish television network was shown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“There can only be one!” So sayeth Connor MacLeod in Highlader and so sayeth the Crimson sports board. So without further ado, here are the two runner-ups in the latest edition of Athlete of the Week.
Maksim Korolev, Men’s Track and Field
 
From cross-country in the fall and straight into the winter track season, this wiry senior hasn’t slowed down at all. The Harrisonville, MO product didn’t just break a Harvard record on Friday at the Terrier Invite in Boston – he broke the Ivy League record for the 5K run.
Korolev even had a chance to catch his breath before second place finisher Michael LeDuc crossed the finish after him…almost 35 seconds later. Korolev’s 13:42.56 time was among the fastest of all NCAA Division I athletes and just under 17 seconds quicker than the previous Harvard record held by Killian D. Lonergan ’97 in 1996 at the same invite.
The time was also just under 16 seconds faster than Korolev’s previous 5K personal record. In the 10K event, Korolev finished with a time of 29:59.5. But maybe after a race like last Friday’s, his legs will understand the purpose of a down escalator.
Hillary Crowe, Women’s Ice Hockey
 
The Crimson scored five goals in two games this weekend, and three of them came from Crowe’s stick. On Saturday at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, the forward found the back of the net 46 seconds into the third period to put Harvard on top against Union, 2-0.
The next day, the junior from Eden Praire, MN was at it again. She helped avenge the Crimson’s loss to RPI earlier this year with two goals against the Engineers in the 3-1 triumph. Demonstrating good puck control, Crowe skated through the RPI defense on a breakaway, fooling Engineer goalie Kelly O’Brien and flipping the puck into the back of the net.
Later in the game, Crowe waited patiently as sophomore teammate Miye O’Dench fed her the puck on the net’s left side. Crowe kept her shot low to the ice, slipping it by O’Brien for her tenth goal of the season.
Crowe is now second on the team in both points and goals and also owns a plus 16 rating when she’s been on the ice this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ECAC has been anything but friendly thus far for the Harvard men’s hockey team (5-11-3, 2-9-3 ECAC), but the Crimson is looking to put another tally in the win column on Friday night as the squad faces Princeton (4-15, 3-9).
Harvard has not won a league game since Nov. 16th, when it clinched a 5-3 victory in its last matchup against the Tigers. 
It was an offensive frenzy the first time these Ivy opponents squared off, with freshman forwards Sean Malone and Tyler Moy, as well as sophomore forward Kyle Criscuolo scoring one goal apiece. 
Sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey, who has posted 12 points in 11 ECAC contests, had two scores on the night. The first came off of a power play early in the third period, and the second finished off Princeton with an empty net shot as the clock approached zero. 
“They’re a pretty physical team, and they like to get up and down the ice,” Criscuolo said. “For us, I think we just need to be aggressive early, and confident. We’ve been struggling a little bit lately. We just need to stay calm throughout the game, stick to our own plan, and not let the game change how we play.”
The last time these two Ancient Eight foes met, much of the scoring came late in the game for the Crimson. Three of the night’s five goals came in the final 20 minutes. 
Slow starts to contests have plagued Harvard thus far this season, forcing it to come from behind on several occasions.
Through the first 19 games of the season, the team has scored only seven of its 47 goals in the first period, and has allowed more goals in the first twenty minutes of play than in either the second or third segments. 
“[Starting better has] been a real point of emphasis the past few weeks,” captain Dan Ford said. “I think we started better last weekend in our game at Union than in the two games the previous weekend. Its something that’s just a mentality sort of thing, just being dialed in and ready to go to capitalize on our chances from the start.”
The Tigers are coming off of a 3-0 loss to No. 3 Union, which sits atop the ECAC standings. 
Princeton’s goaltender, freshman Colton Phinney, had a career-high 45 saves, but allowed two of the three goals scored in the match. 
But penalty trouble for the Tigers gave the Dutchmen a chance to attack Phinney, and they outshot Princeton, 23-5, in the second period. 
Although Union was unable to score on the power plays, it kept the puck on its end of the ice, preventing the Tigers from earning scoring opportunities throughout the contest.
Given Princeton’s penalty issues, power play chances could give Harvard prime chances to gain momentum. 
Thus far, the Crimson has struggled to capitalize on power play advantages this season, ranking second to last in power play goals in the Ivy League.
“We want to make sure that we’re sharp and getting chances every time we go out on the power play,” Ford said. “Those are big situations that can change momentum in the game, and scoring a big goal on a power play can [do just that].”
Harvard’s most recent matchup also came against the Dutchmen, in which the Crimson fell just short, 4-3. 
Despite the loss, Harvard put up a fight against a top team that gives it hope against Princeton. 
“We played [Union] pretty tight and I think everyone was feeling as good as you can out of a loss,” Criscuolo said. “We put a lot of pressure on them, and we’re pretty excited to get into the game on Friday against Princeton and put some pressure on them.”
With 10 games left in the season, Harvard is searching for wins in order to improve its playoff standing. 
Eight of its remaining matchups are against conference opponents. A win against the Tigers would halt the team’s current four-game losing streak and do much for its position in the conference. 
“It’s a big game for us,” Ford said. “We’re battling here in the standings trying to secure a top-eight spot in the league and get home ice in the first round of the playoffs.” 
“Princeton is one of the team’s we’re competing with, so that’s a big two points for us, and we’re excited about the game on Friday,” Ford added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team has been road-tested this year, winning seven of its 11 games away from Lavietes Pavilion on the season.
But the squad will hit the road for possibly the most crucial weekend of the season with a chip on its shoulder, trying to accomplish a goal it hasn’t been able to reach in four years. 
The Crimson (12-4, 2-0 Ivy) will look to end a four-game losing streak at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium on Friday in game one of the Killer P road trip. 
This annual road swing to Princeton  (10-5, 1-0) and Philadelphia has been particularly difficult for Harvard as of late. 
The Crimson came out of last year’s Mid-Atlantic trip with two losses, and squeaked out a four-point win against the Quakers (10-5, 0-1) the year before to salvage a weekend split. 
“[Winning on the Tigers’ home court] would be a big milestone for my senior year,” co-captain guard Christine Clark said. “We haven’t been able to win since I’ve been here.”
Harvard hopes to have more success this year at Princeton, as it does not have to face up against graduated guard Niveen Rasheed. 
The 6’0” star was unanimously voted the Ivy League Player of the Year in her junior and senior season with the Tigers. 
She proved a tough matchup for the Crimson last year, recording a double-double in both contests, including 17 points and 10 rebounds in a 67-51 win at Princeton. 
“Niveen was a great player,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought she was a star who made her teammates better. She was a great leader.” 
Even with the loss of Rasheed to graduation, the Tigers still pose a threat to win the Ivy League for the fifth straight year. Junior guard and Boston-area native Blake Dietrick leads the Princeton offense with 15.4 points per contest. 
Senior Kristen Helmstetter, who contributed nine points and eight rebounds in last year’s win at home against Harvard, leads the Tigers in assists with 3.6 per game. 
“Princeton has worked really hard to fill her shoes and fill in the gaps,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’d be interested to see who’s going to fill those shoes when we play them.”
The Crimson has its own offensive firepower, which it will hope to use to emerge victorious at Princeton for the first time since Jan. 31, 2009. 
Clark has averaged 16.4 points per contest on the year, including a team-high 17 in the squad’s last game against Dartmouth. Junior forward Temi Fagbenle also adds an inside presence to the attack, averaging 13.6 points per game and 9.6 rebounds per matchup. 
Harvard’s tough weekend will continue when the team makes the hour-long drive to Philadelphia.
 Although the Crimson had dominated the matchup with Penn in recent years, the tide began to turn last season. 
After nine winless years against Harvard, Penn was able to pull off a 77-72 win at The Palestra en route to a third-place finish in the Ivy League last season. 
“Penn is a blue collar, well-coached, hardworking team,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think Penn was instrumental in causing us to not win the title [last year].” 
The Crimson will have to keep an eye on Quaker guard Keiera Ray in order to prevail. After stepping into the starting point guard role as a freshman, Ray dropped a career-high 31 points in the team’s matchup in Philadelphia last year. 
Her success came largely at the free-throw line, hitting 14-of-20 attempts in addition to her seven field goals. 
Ray had to miss a significant portion of this season due to an injury, but she is now healthy and poses a threat to Harvard.
The Quakers also boast a strong scorer in their backcourt. Senior guard Alyssa Baron averages 13.1 points per game, and is an integral component of the Penn offense. 
With two wins, the Crimson would stay atop of the Ivy League standings in the early-season jostling for the Ancient Eight crown.
 With Princeton looming as a perennial threat for the title, this weekend could prove crucial in determining who sits atop the Ivy League throne come the end of the season. 
“We have to have, at the very worst, a split,” Delaney-Smith said. “We couldn’t walk away from this weekend losing both and feel good…. With a split we can survive, but I think we’re capable of winning both.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Mexico junior Kendall Williams saw nothing but daylight. A hesitation dribble shook Christian Webster ’13, and Williams bolted to the basket. With four and a half minutes to go, Williams’ third-seeded Lobos were down six to the upstart 14th-seeded Harvard Crimson.
The Mountain West Player of the Year had had a nightmare evening to that point, with nearly as many turnovers—two—as points and assists combined—four. If he could get going, the comeback was not only within reach, but likely.
Williams never got that far. In two steps, then-sophomore center Kenyatta Smith was in the air, swatting the shot away. Less than a minute later, Smith was icing the game from the charity stripe, a 67 percent free throw shooter knocking down both to put Harvard up six.
“This was his time,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker at the time. “This was why I recruited him, to be this kind of player.”
That was then.
This past Sunday, Smith logged his first minutes of the season. Hampered by a foot injury, the junior had sat out the first three months of the season, watching his teammates struggle against intimidating front lines.
First, it was Colorado’s 6’10” Josh Scott and 6’7” Xavier Johnson leading the Buffaloes to a 70-62 win—a game in which the Crimson was outrebounded by 17. Then it was University of Connecticut’s hulking frontcourt of 6’9” DeAndre Daniels, 6’10” Tyler Olander, and 7’0” Amida Brimah holding Harvard to 32 percent shooting from inside the arc during a 61-56 Husky win.
Medically cleared to play Sunday against Dartmouth for the first time all year, Smith came on the floor with the Crimson up 32. In his two minutes of play, just one thing showed up in the box score—a miss on his trademark hook shot that was let loose too late and missed the rim entirely.
This is now.
As Smith comes back from injury, both he and the coaching staff have indicated that he will take it as it comes. Extreme caution is the norm in the wake of the NBA’s re-injury bug, which has taken out stars like Derrick Rose and Russell Westbrook who came back too early.
However, heading down the stretch, this year’s Crimson team needs what Smith can offer. This weekend alone, the squad will face the Quakers’ 6’11” Darien Nelson-Henry and 6’8” Henry Brooks, and Princeton’s 6’10” Will Barrett. Senior Kyle Casey is an excellent defender in his own right, but he is not Smith, a prototypical back-to-the-basket post player and rim protector. In the past, Smith has shown the ability to carry programs to unforeseen heights, and the team will hope for history to repeat itself this season.
THE TALL BOY COMING IN
When Smith first enrolled in Flintridge Preperatory School in La Cañada Flintridge, CA. as a seventh grader, it was without a hint of reclaim. Flintridge coach Garrett Ohara remembers hearing “there was a tall boy coming in.”
At that point, Flintridge had yet to win a division championship or produce a Division I basketball player. It excelled at academics, not athletics. Before he was Smith’s coach, Ohara was his pre-algebra teacher.
“There were other, better schools he could have gone to in the area…higher level basketball schools,” Ohara said. “For him and his mother to decide to come to Flintridge demonstrated that he was very serious about his academics.”
Smith’s basketball talent was evident early; Ohara said his most striking trait was his graceful movement and athleticism, unique for a rapidly growing freshman. However, Smith needed to catch up physically.
During his freshman year, Ohara watched Smith get pushed around inside, struggling to leverage his height properly, and scoring mostly on putbacks and broken plays.
A diligent worker, Smith quickly put it together. A four-year varsity starter, he became a man among boys. Ohara commented that Smith’s current playing weight—at 6’8”, and listed at 250 pounds—is slimmer than in high school, when he would get any shot he wanted in the post. His trademark feathery hook shot was just one in a full arsenal of post moves.
People took notice. In his senior year, Smith averaged nearly 20 points, 15 rebounds, and five blocks a game. ESPN ranked him as the 29th best center in the nation; scout.com had him in the top 15. He was named as one of seven John R. Wooden High School Players of the Year, joining the ranks of former winners like Baron Davis and Tyson Chandler.
“Carve a circle five feet around the basket, and he’s going to do his best to own it,” commented Scout’s David Telep at the time. “Once he gets his feet under him and he gets his conditioning down, he should be an excellent post player for Harvard for four years.”
In his final year of high school, Smith led Flintridge to its first-ever division championship. In a low-scoring game, Smith controlled the paint and rebounded well.
“He could get the ball and take a shot every time but he was cognizant of his teammates,” Ohara said. “He drew double teams, didn’t force shots. The chemistry on that team was exemplary.”
His coach’s final memory was of the eye-to-eye smile Smith showed after the win. Already on his way to Cambridge, the senior didn’t have to prove anything to everyone. Instead, Ohara said, he celebrated having won for a school and community that had never done it before.
“The lasting image was the joy I saw on his face,” Ohara said. “[He was] celebrating not just for the team, but what he did for the school and the entire community that was supporting the team.”
CRIMSON COMMIT
Smith committed to Harvard early, the first coup of a recruiting class that eventually yielded fellow three-star recruit Wesley Saunders as well as big men Jonah Travis and Steve Moundou-Missi. Originally deciding between Vanderbilt, Harvard, and archrival Penn, Smith did not visit another school after his visit to Cambridge.
The decision was unsurprising. For the second time, the big man chose the academic program without a history of success, confident that he could take it to the top.
“[Harvard hasn’t] had a lot of history of winning, but that’s what I want to be a part of,” he said at the time. “I want to be there when that first happens…. It’s coming soon, and I want to be a part of it.”
Smith’s comments proved prescient. During his freshman campaign, Harvard cracked the AP Top 25, winning the Ivy League outright a year after grabbing a share of the title.
The team won 26 games and the Battle for Atlantis title, losing in the first round of the NCAA Tournament against a Commodore team with three first-round NBA draft picks, 80-71.
But Smith was nowhere to be found. After being named the best incoming freshman in the Ancient Eight by ESPN’s Paul Biancardi, he saw the floor for a total of 17 minutes as a rookie.
Classmates Saunders, Moundou-Missi, and Corbin Miller all averaged at least 10 minutes a game as Smith struggled. He attempted just one field goal all season In Ivy League play, he saw three minutes in 14 games.
“I think the physicality and the pace of the game frustrated him,” Ohara said. “Being away from home…there are a lot of [new] factors into being at Harvard.”
However, heading into his sophomore year, Smith became the starting center with the departures of Keith Wright ’13 and Casey. He headed an all-sophomore frontcourt, playing as the lone center in a four-guard lineup.
The initial returns were mixed. He had eight points, eight rebounds, five blocks, and three assists in just 21 minutes against MIT. He and Moundou-Missi combined for six blocks in the next game, holding the University of Massachusetts to just 38 percent shooting in a 67-64 loss.
After his second consecutive 20-minute outing against the Minutemen, however, he got that much time just once in the next 18 outings—a zero-point, three-turnover effort in a seven-point loss to Vermont.
BLOCK PARTY
But things turned around for the big man, and against Penn and Princeton, Smith finally got his big break. With the Crimson reeling from its first league loss—a 15-point blowout at Columbia—Amaker put Smith in the starting lineup for the contest against the Quakers.
The then-sophomore seized the moment and ran with it, putting forth 20 points, nine rebounds, and a program-record 10 blocks in a 19-point win over the school he had spurned.
The next night, he proved Penn wasn’t a fluke, posting 14 points, seven rebounds, and another six blocks, going perfect from the field and the free-throw line. The Crimson beat Princeton by 12.
Afterwards, Smith was brutally honest about how playing not to lose, instead of playing to win, had hampered him in prior situations.
“My goal before was to not mess up,” Smith said. “Now it’s just to let the game flow and do what I do best: rebound, block shots. Luckily, the rest has come with it.”
For the rest of the campaign, Smith started. If he was doing what he did best, he did it better than nearly anyone in the nation.
His season averages of 4.3 rebounds and 2.1 blocks don’t look impressive on paper; account for the minutes played and Smith blocked 5.8 shots per 40 minutes—better than first-round pick Nerlens Noel, second-round pick Jeff Withey, and third in the nation.
“The Penn-Princeton weekend was when it exploded for him,” Amaker said. “He changed our team.”
DON’T CALL IT A COMEBACK
Half a year later, Smith entered the season as the squad’s starting center. His defensive presence formed the fulcrum of the team’s defense the year before; with a strong rim protector behind them, perimeter guards played in the face of their marks, confident in the help coming behind them.
He defended big men well, taking on consecutive seven-footers—New Mexico’s Alex Kirk and Arizona’s Kaleb Tarczewski—in the tournament.
But then the injury bug struck. A stress reaction became a hairline fracture with overuse.
Five days before the season opener against Holy Cross, Smith learned that he’d have to sit out indefinitely. Taking a redshirt season wasn’t a possibility for the junior.
“I don’t know if I was so eager to take the rest of the year off, honestly,” Smith said. “These guys have done some incredible things on the court and with team chemistry, and that is something I want to be a part of.”
His teammates are eagerly awaiting his return. When he entered the Dartmouth game, the entire bench gave the junior a standing ovation. On Monday, Saunders called Smith a “game changer.”
For a team that hasn’t had its full lineup since summer scrimmages—co-captain Brandyn Curry and Saunders have both missed time—Smith’s return to the court is symbolic, coming at the beginning of the Ivy stretch run that will see the team try to realize its immense potential.
For the third time, the center will try to lift a program whose history in the classroom dwarfs its prowess on the court. As Smith comes back from injury, his minutes are uncertain, but if history holds, his presence will continue to be felt.

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the outcome of the Nov. 13, 2012 men's basketball game against the University of Massachusetts. In fact, Harvard lost the game 67-64. The article also incorrectly stated the round in which Jeff Withey was drafted into the NBA. In fact, he was a second-round pick.

With spring term classes just beginning, Harvard Law School's campus is beginning to swing back into its cycle of stressed out law students chugging coffee, sleeping in Langdell, and nervously cramming for their next Socratic interrogation. Yet the break has not been devoid of news from the campus just north of the yard. Here's what you missed over the winter recess.
 
Cruzin’ and Law Reviewin’
Flyby’s favorite HLS alumni serving in the U.S. Senate reconnected with his former law school once again this January—this time on the pages of the Harvard Law Review’s latest issue. Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas who graduated from the Law School in 1995, authored a 10,000-word essay on the “Limits of Treaty Power,” offering his thoughts on Bond v. United States, a case currently before the Supreme Court. Cruz argues that the case, which addresses the federal government’s power to make treaties, represents a significant moment in which the Court must limit the President’s power. In a technical constitutional analysis that spans 181 footnotes, Cruz left a staunchly conservative mark on the Law Review, seen by many as the height of the liberal academia. Perhaps the Law School has evolved from its time as the Kremlin on the Charles, an accusation which Cruz aired last year, or maybe the Senator is simply making the first step.
 
Barron Battles On
Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron, a former Crimson president who was nominated by President Barack Obama in September for the First Circuit Court of Appeals, made it one step closer to becoming a federal judge this January. After facing an uphill battle in the Senate as Obama’s nominees were rejected one by one, filibuster reform in December seemed to ensure his confirmation. On January 16, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Barron, along with 28 other nominees, to the full Senate. Yet Barron did face some opposition, particularly from Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, who called Barron’s views “far outside the mainstream.” Barron passed through with a vote of ten to eight and is expected to be confirmed soon. Meanwhile, here at Harvard, President Drew G. Faust charged Barron with heading a task force to look at email privacy policies across the University. The report is supposed to be issued to Faust in January. The question remains—which body will work faster, a committee made up of Harvard faculty members or the United States Senate?
 
Grade Inflation, Law School Style
While grade inflation at Harvard College has made headlines across the country, even more serious problems are coming out of Harvard Law School. The jury is still out on whether Mathew Martoma, a former hedge fund manager, carried out one of the largest insider trading schemes in history. But there is no question that he cheated the system as a student at Harvard Law School a decade and a half ago when he was expelled for creating a false transcript in an application for a clerkship. Martoma changed several grades from B’s to A’s, and then faked even more evidence to cover his tracks. Perhaps this can serve as a lesson to the College: if you are concerned about grade inflation, you can always just expel the students with A’s.
