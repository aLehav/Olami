After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just this past February, President Faust inaugurated “Harvard on the Move,” a community fitness program that intends to foster a culture of healthy living and exercise at Harvard. On the same theme, HUHDS regularly serves a wide variety of healthy options to allow students to make better dietary choices. Against this backdrop of fostering healthy lifestyles at Harvard, it is disconcerting that the administration may be closing certain House gyms due to their allegedly high maintenance costs.
Since these gyms are, in many cases, vital resources in House communities, students should not be reading about their potential closure in The Crimson first. The process of assessing their value must involve the entire House, as the primary clientele of these gyms—the students—know best whether their facilities are used and necessary. Even if a particular House gym is deemed too expensive to keep, the House Masters ought to be in a conversation with the students, looking for a workable solution that does not leave Houses with a missing vital asset.
Although the two other gym options—the Malkin Athletic Center and Hemenway Gymnasium—offer amenities unavailable anywhere else, they suffer from overcrowding and have limiting hours that make a visit to either one more of a challenge for busy students. The 24-hour House gyms, however, are fit to meet the needs of the students who frequent them. They’re almost always available, and you don’t feel as though you should have made a reservation months in advance. Also, as the frequent location of friendly in-House encounters, it should go without saying that House gyms foster community and are valuable social assets to those who use them.
Of course, it’s entirely possible that some gyms, perhaps those in Houses nearest the MAC, are superfluous and underutilized. We don’t deny that this could be the case. If so, however, House administrators should come to this conclusion through a conversation with students. If, for instance, the money to maintain a particular House gym is just not there, students may be willing to accept a subscription-based program like the one currently in place in Mather, where students pay $10 for a semester’s worth of access. In any case, gyms should not be closed unilaterally. If the College, as usual, is concerned about liability issues in the maintenance of these gyms, the administration ought to be open about its concerns and should work with students to minimize them.
In the event that certain gyms are eventually closed, the MAC will play a much larger part in some students’ lives. Accordingly, there should be more channels through which to offer suggestions and voice concerns about the MAC’s operations. Fewer House gyms will likely necessitate the need for more machines and, potentially, longer hours at the MAC. The College should be open to such suggestions.
Since all members of the Harvard community want a healthy, active student body, it is important that the administration not undercut this goal by closing House gyms without an appropriate conversation with students.  Student wellbeing is vital to our community, and the College ought to make high-quality facilities for physical activity as accessible as possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early 2010, the disruption of talks by major officials was all the rage on university campuses, even as these outbursts inspired greater measures of outrage amongst the broader student body. In January, General David H. Petraeus was repeatedly shouted down by student anti-war protesters during a speech to a packed Gaston Hall at Georgetown University. In response, organizations across campus—from the Georgetown University Student Union to the Georgetown Democrats—condemned the conduct. The next month, Israeli Ambassador Michael B. Oren was similarly assailed, this time by 11 members of the Muslim Student Union at UC-Irvine. The interruptions of “war criminal” and “mass murderer,” which prevented the ambassador from addressing an assembled audience of hundreds, were harshly condemned by the university administration, and the MSU was subsequently suspended as a campus organization.
But what seemed like a typical story of an overheated campus culture clash took an unusual turn after emails among the MSU’s membership surfaced indicating that the Irvine disruptions were carefully coordinated by the group to prevent the ambassador from speaking—a premeditated plan that involved staggered disruptions by predetermined individuals with cue cards, all directed via text messages. In light of this evidence, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas convened an investigatory grand jury and then leveled charges against the so-called “Irvine 11,” bringing the campus controversy into the California courts. Arraigned this past Friday, the students each pled not guilty to misdemeanor counts of conspiracy to disturb a meeting and disturbance of a meeting.
To understand why this prosecution is justified, and indeed similar future prosecutions of campus disruptors are warranted, one must first understand what this prosecution is not.
It is decidedly not an “absolute affront to the Constitution” that will “inhibit the free exchange of ideas,” as Dan Stormer and Jacqueline Goodman, two of the Irvine defense attorneys, have claimed. It is their clients who sought to inhibit the free exchange of ideas by shouting down Oren’s speech, preventing him and the estimated crowd of 500-700 individuals from exercising their rights to free speech and assembly.
In fact, when viewed through the lens of pragmatism rather than partisanship, the prosecution of these disruptors clearly protects our civil discourse. Imagine, for contrast, a campus climate in which it is possible for any sufficiently motivated group to shut down an event to which it is ideologically opposed. Not only would Ambassador Oren and General Petraeus be shouted off the stage, but Nancy Pelosi would be accosted with cries of “baby killer,” while Omar Barghouti, who spoke recently at Harvard to advocate boycott of Israel, could be met with jeers of “terrorist” and “anti-semite.” It is essential for the preservation of considered campus conversation that such suppressive “speech” never be tolerated, no matter the opinion being espoused. Simply put, no partisan should have a vocal veto over the marketplace of ideas.
Beyond the practical necessity of such prosecution, there is also strong legal justification for it. As Professor Eugene Volokh of UCLA, a renowned free speech expert explains, “California law rightly makes it a crime to interfere with people’s rights to speak, and listeners’ rights to listen.” Volokh is a long-time equal opportunity advocate for First Amendment rights, having defended flag-burning, anti-Israel bus advertisements and even the permissibility of voluntarily-assumed Sharia arbitration on U.S. soil. To him, the Irvine case is not an example of individuals exercising free speech but rather attempting to stifle it. “Of course, the defendants have their own free speech rights,” he says. “They could have freely exercised them outside the meeting. They could have exercised them during Q&A … They could have exercised them by staging their own event. But First Amendment law has long recognized that there’s no right to speak so loudly that it interferes with other people’s activity.”
Countering a misconception, Volokh adds that “while a jail term is theoretically available” if the defendants are found guilty, “it will be highly unlikely for first offenders.” Rather, “in a case such as this, the defendants …  will be fined, put on probation, and possibly sentenced to some community service.” And that, he concludes, “sounds like about the right punishment.”
Of course, prosecution is a last resort only to be employed when students themselves are unable to respect the opinions of others and the rights of their fellow students. Ideally, even the most impassioned groups would choose to engage in dialogue rather than diatribe. But for those partisan purists not dissuaded by the pragmatic and legal consequences of Irvine-esque conduct, there remains one final objection to such tactics: they don’t work. At Georgetown, the ejection of anti-war protesters was met with sustained applause and the disruptions were condemned across the campus political spectrum. At UC-Irvine, the student group responsible was suspended, and the administration left angry and embarrassed. These reactions are unsurprising: the arrogance of those who seek to override the free speech prerogatives of others alienates rather than attracts people to their cause. The assumption that one’s viewpoint is so self-evidently correct that the rights of others can be trampled to trumpet it proves predictably counterproductive, as self-righteousness so often does. Student groups interested in actual influence ought to take note and save their objections for the Q&A.
Too often, we forget that freedom of speech is largely about silence. The dignity of discourse in America stems not merely from the right of each individual to speak freely, but from those who might vehemently disagree making space for that person to express themselves. Our universities ought to be models for this mutually respectful conversation, not where it is in constant danger. With that in mind, let us make the Irvine prosecution into a teaching moment about the nature of our nation’s most fundamental freedoms. And let us be reminded what we owe each other as Americans, even—or especially—in the confines of our college campuses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
April 2 has often been a momentous day in our nation’s history. In addition to being the birthday of this writer’s mother, it is the date on which Juan Ponce de León waded ashore to set foot on the exotic land of Florida (“Lo,” he is said to have exclaimed. “What a land. There is a power scooter store on every corner!”). And so it is fitting that it was on April 2, 2011, the 498th anniversary of the day Ponce took his skills to South Beach, that I came to the conclusion that it is high time we cut Florida loose.
One would expect that a region with palm trees waving in the breeze, spectacular sunsets, and such a high ratio of oranges to people would be relatively tranquil. But, like the line of thinking supporting Donald Trump for president, this is simply wrong.
Former governor Charles J. “Charlie” Crist pursued a pardon for singer Jim Morrison, who is, in fact, dead as a Doornail. Florida handed George W. Bush the presidency after Albert A. “Al” Gore ‘69 won the popular vote but guessed wrong in Final Jeopardy. Orlando’s most famous resident is a giant mouse who inexplicably wears pants. And its second most famous resident is Tiger Woods, another rodent who became infamous for all-too-frequently not wearing pants.
But the real man of the hour is Terry “You Thought Charlie Sheen Was The Biggest Loose Cannon Around?” Jones. For those of you whose minds have not been liquefied by listening to “Friday” on repeat, you might remember back to September when Mr. Jones, a Gainesville preacher, threatened to burn a stack of Korans on Sept. 11. After being called by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, who politely offered to test the U.S.’s nuclear arsenal in Jones’ pews, Jones backed down and crawled back into obscurity. But his thirst for public demonstrations of intolerance apparently could not be quenched, and on March 20, he oversaw the burning of a Koran. This prompted the April 1 killing of 12 United Nations workers in Afghanistan and several more in subsequent days of anti-US protests.
After the initial shock and anger, you might have been surprised to learn that Jones had gone ahead with a book burning. It turns out that unlike in September, when the US media made him the center of a global firestorm, the press seems to have wised up and refused to give him the coverage that he so plainly does not deserve. Our journalists ought to be commended for deliberately ignoring his attention-seeking behavior. Or maybe they were just too busy covering Lindsay Lohan’s views on the situation in Libya.
But now that Jones has gone ahead with his hate-mongering that has caused the death of innocent people, it is time we all faced some hard facts. This Florida stuff is never going to stop. There’s something in the water down there that should make old Ponce de León very happy that he never found the fountain he was looking for. In fact, aside from Carrot Top, nothing good has ever come out of Florida. Richard L. “Rick” Scott, tea-partying governor who has proposed slashing the state’s education budget by nearly $700 per student? Florida. Leighton Meester, homicidal roommate magnet? Florida. Vanilla Ice, inspiration for the original Starbucks drink order? Florida.
So Ponce, I know you meant well, but 498 years is enough to show that this is not just a phase Florida is going through. Perhaps we can get Rand Paul on board by proposing to jettison Florida as a way to shrink the government and get rid of its budget deficit. If that is too radical, or if we just don’t want to have to buy new 49-star flags, we can swap Florida for Guam, where nothing bad ever happens (okay, where nothing ever happens, but that would be a huge step in the right direction). But however we do it, let’s do what we can to make next April 2 the day we celebrate the departure of Florida from our union. And until then, let’s all use April 2 as an occasion to remind me to call my mother, because she just threatened to move to Miami if I ever forget her birthday again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday confirmed what I have always known: Yardfest really is the best day of the year. The event represents the potential for administration-sponsored and funded programming to unify an often fractured student body and to provide a much-needed diversion from the stresses of academic and extracurricular life. Every year I ask why there are not more events like Yardfest, events that are free, inclusive, accessible, and fun. And every year I come to the conclusion that Yardfest and similar events are rare not because there is no demand for them, but because student groups like the Undergraduate Council and College Events Board lack the resources to plan them consistently and efficiently. While the administration rightfully relies on these organizations to power campus social life, it chronically underfunds them and their programs. Student life would benefit from more events like Yardfest and this requires the University to match its rhetoric with its resources. If student organizations should form the foundation of social life on campus, the administration must give them the means to do so.
On a campus that lacks a central social space, Yardfest transforms Tercentenary Theater into a student center for an evening. It is one of the few days of the year when you can run into, interact, and reconnect with almost everyone you know. The event reaffirms Harvard as a unified community instead of a fractured student body split into Houses, teams, final clubs, and extracurricular organizations. Whereas other schools charge exorbitantly for tickets to their spring concerts, the administration has laudably kept Yardfest free. As a member of the CEB, I sometimes criticized this approach for denying us the additional funds that could help us afford better artists. But let’s be real. No one goes to Yardfest because they want to hear awesome music. They go to be outside, to see friends, and to participate in a community event. Keeping Yardfest free allows every student to attend without worrying about the financial ramifications of paying for a ticket. We need more events like this, not necessarily huge outdoor concerts, but events that echo Yardfest’s commitment to accessibility and inclusivity.
Events like Yardfest are also critical because only these large, free events can effectively compete with final club and room parties that draw students into less safe, less inclusive spaces. Faced with the prospect of spending nearly $10 to attend a dining hall dance (or as much as $30 to go to a House Formal!), few can be blamed for turning to clubs that offer free admission and alcohol. This is not in the best interest of the administration, which loses the ability to monitor the health and behavior of its students. But neither is this in the interest of the final clubs and other societies that host parties. With limited space, capacity quickly becomes an issue that leads to (recently reported-on) fights and overcrowding. Everyone stands to benefit from increasing administration emphasis on funding large, free, and inclusive events.
Yet hosting events like this at Harvard is an immensely difficult undertaking. Harvard lacks spaces on campus that are designed to accommodate large parties. Therefore, groups are forced to search for privately owned venues that are often incredibly expensive. This is why the UC’s Large Venue Grant Pilot Program, which provides $10,000 grants for organizations to host Yardfest-like programs off campus, is such a welcome addition to the social scene. It demonstrates the UC’s understanding that creating attractive and inclusive social options is incredibly resource intensive. The administration should do everything it can to expand, support, and promote this new initiative.
Without additional administration funding, the UC is necessarily limited by its own budgetary limitations and inefficiencies. They have too many mouths to feed, which forces them to split their student group allocations into laughably small grants—they have traditionally been capped at around $200. Meanwhile the CEB, which excels at event planning, quickly burns through its annual allocation of $200,000 based on the costs of Yardfest and the Harvard Carnival.
So what should the administration do? They must boost UC funding significantly so that the Council can provide larger grants to student organizations and can continue and expand their Large Venue pilot program. They must also increase CEB funding so that the organization can do more of what it does best—large-scale, free, inclusive programming. Money is tight and has been for as long as I’ve been at Harvard, but the appeal and success of Yardfest demonstrates the importance of funding sufficient programming for the entire College. And I’m not just saying all of this because Yardfest is my favorite day of the year. This type of events represents the best way to provide alternatives to exclusive and gendered social space, to build a unified community at Harvard, and, most importantly, to make student life at Harvard more fun, varied, and accessible.

After a controversy two years ago in which small concentrations of a toxic chemical were found in Harvard graduate student housing at Peabody Terrace, the apartment complex continues to undergo extensive renovations as part of a three-year repair plan.
The project will occur in three phases, in which each of the high-rise buildings in the family-oriented housing structure will be improved through remodeling and waterproofing.
Phase one of the project will be completed in May, and phase two began earlier this month.
“Harvard continuously updates projects to make sure quality housing is available for all students,” said University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall.
In addition to the structural modifications, Marshall said there will be many aesthetic improvements, including landscaping, enhanced interior lighting, and new bicycle racks.
Despite the high level of occupancy at Peabody Terrace—99 percent of the apartments are currently inhabited—the construction will have a minimal impact on residents.
The apartments have remained open throughout the construction and will continue to be rented as vacancies arise.
Though the project is currently on schedule, it has not been without difficulties.
In fall 2009, small concentrations of a toxic chemical known as Polychlorinated Biphenyls were discovered at Peabody Terrace.
According to Katy Donovan, director of the Peabody Terrace Children’s Center, Harvard Real Estate Services has kept in contact with the PTCC over the findings and collaborated with the center’s administration. The PTCC provides childcare to University affiliated families as well as nearby residents.
“We feel informed at this point,” Donovan wrote in an emailed statement.
Marshall further stated that Harvard Real Estate Services has developed a “comprehensive communication plan” to inform residents of the construction’s progression, including a 24-hour hotline, a website with a schedule of daily updates, and hand-delivered notices informing residents of major construction.
“Prior to signing their leases, prospective tenants have been informed of the project and its schedule,” Marshall said.
“One of the goals of the projects has been to minimize impact on the childcare facility as well as the residents,” she added.
The construction’s primary impact on children living in the complex includes loud work-related noise and strong smells from building materials, according to Donovan. The PTCC will move to a temporary modular building on the grounds at Peabody Terrace this spring.
“This relocation is to avoid the noise and smells of the construction, so is essentially for convenience not health reasons,” Donovan wrote.
Though the construction will disrupt students’ access to the Peabody Terrace playground, Donovan said that the children will still have access to many other public spaces, including several city-owned parks and playgrounds.
Nonetheless, Donovan expressed hope that the children of Peabody Terrace will again have access to multiple playgrounds within the grounds of the apartment complex.
“We are hopeful that after the construction that HRE will re-install the playgrounds,” Donovan said.

The sizes of nine critical regions in the brain may serve as predictors for Alzheimer’s disease, according to a new study led by Bradford C. Dickerson, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.
The study builds on Dickerson’s prior research, which observed that these nine regions exhibited shrinkage in Alzheimer’s patients.
Aly Negreira, a research assistant at Dickerson’s lab, said that this past work “highlighted certain nodes in the brain that shrink preferentially if you are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.”
The latest research indicates that cognitively normal individuals with smaller measurements in these regions are more likely to be afflicted with Alzheimer’s in the future.
The researchers tracked 65 subjects, all initially cognitively normal, for approximately a decade. When the study concluded, six of the eleven subjects with the smallest brain measurements had developed Alzheimer’s.
Negreira said these patients were “asymptomatic about a decade before they actually converted to dementia.”
Conversely, all nine subjects with the largest measurements remained cognitively normal ten years into the study.
Such results suggest that this method could one day serve as an early diagnostic technique for Alzheimer’s, according to Dickerson.
Though he was quick to note that his research was still in the beginning stages, he expressed cautious optimism concerning its potential.
If this method were refined and adapted further, he said, its predictive role could resemble that of high cholesterol in predicting heart disease.
Current Alzheimer’s diagnostic techniques are largely reactionary, Dickerson said: patients exhibit cognitive symptoms, go to the doctor, and receive a diagnosis.
A technique to identify those cognitively normal individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s would allow early intervention and treatment.
While such techniques are far in the future, Dickerson explained some more short-term applications of the study’s results.
The research, he said, could allow for more focused testing of Alzheimer’s drugs by limiting the pool of test subjects to those most likely to fall ill.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Development in Allston has come to a standstill, four local residents told a group of seven students from the Institute of Politics last Friday.
The IOP’s Community Action Committee organized a community conversation with parents whose children attend the Gardner Pilot Academy in Allston.
The IOP has offered its services to the Academy since December, when students organized a fair for the school.
Peter M. Bozzo ’12, chair of the Community Action Committee, said that learning about the neighborhood’s relationship with Harvard would combine the political element of the IOP with its local community programming.
“Harvard students don’t know about it as much as they should,” said Bozzo, who is also a member of the Crimson Editorial Board. “To really understand the service, we have to learn about the context.”
For most of the IOP students who attended, it was their first time venturing across the river and learning about the complex town and gown relationship.
Residents shared personal stories and memories about their experience with Harvard’s involvement in their community.
Patricia Emery, a lifelong Allston resident, said she was a beneficiary of Harvard, living in a recently built residential neighborhood funded by the University.
But she recognized why some residents may be cynical about the University’s presence, especially given recent delays in development.
“There’s pros and cons to the situation,” Emery said. “It feels like [the development] is at a standstill.”
Local resident Harry E. Mattison explained that since the halt of the Science Complex construction in December 2009 due to financial constraints, projects have either slowed down or come to a halt.
According to Mattison, residents were excited about the University’s plan to turn the vacant lot on Western Ave. into a vibrant “main street.”
But many residents feel that promise was not kept.
“There was this sense of urgency attending meetings,”  said local resident Rita L. Vaidya, recalling hiring babysitters in a rush to attend meetings.
Some residents said that quality of life in parts of Allston has been lowered by a rat infestation that they believe resulted from ­­the construction of the 4.5 acre hole in Western Ave. that was to be the base of the Science Complex.
Returning to campus, the students discussed their reactions to residents’ concerns about Harvard’s involvement across the Charles.
“What surprised me the most was the passion of the people who were speaking there,” Bozzo said. “I was so impressed about how much knowledge they had acquired about Harvard and Harvard’s expansion there.”
The IOP event was the first time Amanda E. McGowan ’13 learned the history of the Harvard-Allston relationship.
“I was surprised the way that Harvard tried to expand into the neighborhood,” McGowan said. “It was disheartening to hear, especially as a Harvard student.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard students and community members gathered on the steps of Widener Library Saturday afternoon to show support for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, commonly referred to as the DREAM Act.
Currently, children raised in the United States without documentation graduate from U.S. high schools with few options to receive financial aid for college or obtain legal status.
“The DREAM Act is something we should all support,” said Carly L. Rush, a Harvard Kennedy School student. “I’m here with my fellow Harvard students and students around the country fighting for a just cause.”
Emilio R. Vicente and Jeanette M. Acosta, both Kennedy School students, organized the Wake Up Harvard rally for the DREAM Act.
“We’re hoping to raise awareness and show solidarity,” Vicente said. “I’m a dreamer myself, and it’s common sense to give students the opportunity to go to college and get a job. It will let them reach their full potential.”
Vicente and Acosta said the event was a kickoff for a coalition among university campuses for the DREAM Act.
“Our vision for the future is to have an Ivy League-wide DREAM Act coalition,” Acosta said. “There’s a solidarity that’s lacking on the east coast. We hope to bring institutions together and build up universities that don’t already have an organization to fight for humane legislation.”
The organizers made a banner for supporters to sign, which they plan to send to Senator Scott P. Brown’s office. Brown was opposed to the DREAM Act, calling it “back door amnesty” last December at a Salvation Army charity event in downtown Boston.
“It’s our little gift to him,” Acosta said.
Vicente and Acosta led the group in a series of chants including, “hey, hey, ho, ho, Senator Brown has got to go” and “education, not deportation.”
“I know a number of people who aren’t documented and don’t have the opportunity to go college because of a nine digit number,” said Pierre R. Berastain ’11. “They’re the cream of the crop and want to give back to the country, but they can’t get an education. It’s an injustice.”
The DREAM Act, first introduced to the Senate in 2001, was most recently reintroduced in the House of Representatives in 2009. Although the bill passed in the House, it was stopped in a Senate filibuster, falling four votes short of the necessary 60.
The DREAM Act would help those who are under the age of 35, arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16, have resided continuously in the U.S. for five years, have graduated from a U.S. high school or obtained a general education diploma, and have “good moral character.”
If these students were to complete college or enlist in the armed forces for two years, they would obtain temporary residence for a six-year period.
University President Drew G. Faust previously has advocated for the measure. Faust’s support of the DREAM Act was particularly salient in June 2010, when Eric Balderas ’13, an undocumented Harvard student, was detained by the authorities and faced possible deportation to Mexico. Balderas was ultimately able to continue his studies at the College, but the incident sparked debate about the measure across campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council presented an unusually thick agenda at its general meeting last night, passing six different pieces of legislation, including an act to support Harvard Students for Safe Space despite strong feelings of opposition from particular council members.
Under the act, the UC will publicly support various goals of the Harvard Students for Safe Space—a recognized student group committed to increasing the safety and accessibility of social space on campus.
Some of the most prominent provisions of the act include a call for an increase in funding for student-initiated parties and a stronger effort to make existing common spaces—such as house Junior Common Rooms—more readily available.
“Through our conversations with final club members and the administration, we found that it is much more productive to emphasize alternatives,” said Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11, co-coordinator of the HSSS movement. “This is about taking the space we already have and making it more socially conducive.”
With this legislation, HSSS hopes to “wed” their organization with the UC in order to “present a united front to administration,” according to Berkenfeld.
“This act is a byproduct of a lot of hard work with these students,” UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 said. “There has been a lot of work amongst sponsors to finalize the language.”
Although the legislation passed unanimously, strong opposition was voiced when the meeting came to a close, particularly by UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair David Gonzalez ’11, who was not present when the vote took place.
According to Gonzalez, the passage of the act represented a Council endorsement of a controversial campaign that “puts one group of students against another.”
“This basically implies that final clubs are deserving of a higher level of scrutiny and deserve to have more aspersions cast upon them,” Gonzalez said. “I’m a poor, Mexican Catholic from public school in Texas, so obviously I don’t have a special affinity towards final clubs, but this is not something I can support.”
Despite this opposition, Ebrahim maintained strong support.
“This act is to make a public statement that we are supporting the efforts of this organization,” he said. “The least we can do, on behalf of the student body, is to vote to approve initiatives for improving social space.”

University President Drew G. Faust touted Harvard as a place of learning and discovery in a speech welcoming prospective freshmen and their families to Visitas—the visiting program for admitted students—in Sanders Theatre on Saturday.
“Harvard has a way of unfolding for each of us. It has a way ... of making transformations happen,” she said. “You will find here a near infinity of opportunity.”
The visiting program’s record attendance this year of 1,350 prospective students was reflected by the crowd in Sanders. Many students and parents were forced to watch the address from an overflow room in the Science Center.
Faust stressed student access to faculty, the ability to engage in a wide variety of interests for the sake of exploration, and expanded opportunities with the General Education program and in the arts as positive factors for prospective students to consider when making their decisions.
“Try to imagine this place as your place and try to keep in mind the almost limitless possibilities,” she said.
While Faust said she hoped the accepted students would attend Harvard, she encouraged them to think carefully about their choices.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, who introduced Faust, echoed this sentiment.
“There’s a lot of things we try to sell you on ... but the most important thing is that you find the right match,” he said. “Try to make any big decision in your life with your heart and not your head.”
When asked to list the top reasons not to go to Harvard, Faust deferred, touting the value of attending a large research university but encouraging students to consider whether that is what they want from their college experiences.
Faust and Fitzsimmons were not short on praising the future members of the class of 2015.
“Except for my class, the class of ’67, this is the greatest class at Harvard,” Fitzsimmons said with a smile.
While focusing on their own perceptions of Harvard, the speakers acknowledged Harvard’s image in the media.
Fitzsimmons said that he went to Harvard at a time before Legally Blonde and the Social Network—movies that he said do not accurately represent life at Harvard.
Referring to the Social Network movie, Faust cited Mark Zuckberg’s founding of Facebook as a Harvard undergraduate as proof that at Harvard, “even a romantic failure can have pretty extraordinary outcomes.”
Visitas, which officially began on Saturday and finishes this afternoon, provides prospective students with a variety of opportunities to experience the offerings of the Harvard community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WOBURN, Mass.—As the second week of the trial of alleged Kirkland shooter Jabrai Jordan Copney came to a close, an alleged cooperator in the crime was grilled on the witness stand by the defense.
Prosecutors have granted the witness, Blayn Jiggetts, a plea bargain in exchange for testifying. On the stand Friday, Jiggetts said that Copney planned to rob Justin Cosby, the victim, and fired the shot that killed him—but defense attorney John A. Amabile has said since the opening statements that Jiggetts was actually the man who pulled the trigger.
In court on Friday, Amabile spent nearly three hours dissecting Jiggetts’ version of the events in the case.
Amabile suggested that Jiggetts and Jason Aquino—the third man who was indicted for the murder and who has also reached a plea agreement—collaborated on a story which would pin Copney for the murder.
Amabile established in his questioning that Jiggetts and Jason Aquino were friends since childhood, whereas Copney had met them both within the year that the shooting took place.
After noting that Jiggetts has called Aquino “cousin” because of their close camaraderie, Amabile referred to Aquino as “cousin Jason” repeatedly during his cross-examination.
“We don’t know what happened; it’s all Jabrai Copney—that’s the story you and your pal, your cousin Jason Aquino talked about,” Amabile said. “You made an agreement that the two of you, who didn’t care what happened to Copney, would lie to the police.”
Jiggetts denied Amabile’s interpretation, saying that Copney himself concocted a cover story that the men originally told to investigators.
Jiggetts said on the stand that he sought out the gun, which was owned by Aquino, and brought it from New York City, the three men’s hometown. Jiggetts further admitted to loading the gun in a Harvard dorm room before the shooting. He said he pulled the gun in the Kirkland annex basement to threaten Cosby—the eventual shooting victim—before handing it over to Copney.
“Why did you bring bullets with you?” Amabile asked.
“I was told by Jabrai it was vital because we were dealing with a street kid,” Jiggetts said, referring to Cosby, the intended target of an armed robbery of marijuana which Jiggetts says the three men had planned.
Amabile continued, “You brought bullets because you wanted to be prepared to shoot somebody. Is that correct, sir?”
When Jiggetts replied, “Not at all,” Amabile came close to shouting.
“That’s the only reason you need bullets,” he said. “Is that correct?”
In the final line of questioning in his lengthy cross-examination, Amabile focused on the fact that in exchange for his cooperation against Copney, Jiggetts has been promised a 9 to 12 year prison sentence, two years of which he has already served—as opposed to the life sentence without parole which Copney could face for a first-degree murder conviction.
“You know darn right well that you’re going to get out seven years from now—and when you’re 28 years old, you’re going to be flying free, even though you killed somebody,” Amabile said.
“I didn’t kill anybody,” Jiggetts responded.
After Jiggetts left the witness stand moments after that exchange, Amabile cross-examined ballistics expert Stephen Walsh, who inspected the crime scene—Kirkland’s J-entryway—on the day of the shooting and the following day. During Amabile’s questioning, Walsh said that the bullet he found embedded in the wall of the landing on the way to the entryway’s basement seemed to have been fired from above, while the bullet lodged in the door of the entryway seemed to have been fired upward. The trajectories of the two shots, Walsh confirmed, suggests a shooter who was standing on the stairs above the landing.
As Jiggetts told it, Copney fired at Cosby while standing in the doorway of an art room in the basement, rather than on the staircase. A gunman in that position would have to fire bullets which could turn corners in order to reach the door, Amabile said, comparing such a feat to a Road Runner cartoon.
“That’s fake, isn’t it?” Amabile asked Walsh. “That defies the laws of gravity and physics—that’s only in a cartoon, isn’t it?”
After a break for Patriots’ Day today, the third week of testimony in the trial will commence tomorrow.

This past Friday at Harvard Law School, Newark mayor Cory A. Booker told a packed crowd that Americans had grown complacent in the fight against racial injustice.
Booker challenged Americans to overcome their alternating states of “sedentary agitation” and “toxic resignation” in order to create change.
“We can grow drunk on the wine from other people’s struggle. We can grow dumb, fat and happy, consuming all that was put before us by our ancestors. Or we can get engaged in the work,” Booker said.
The Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice organized Friday’s speech.
During his remarks, Booker discussed his childhood and growing up in an affluent and predominantly white suburb.
“The very house I grew up in, my parents could not buy. They had to get a white couple to pose as them,” Booker said.
Booker went on to graduate from Yale Law School and became mayor of Newark, a city marked by economic woes, crime, and racial tension.
Booker said the American public is not sufficiently concerned about the problems faced in America’s inner cities.
He noted that nearly everyone in the audience knew the names of JonBenet Ramsey and Natalee Holloway, people of privilege who had been murdered, but not the names of murder victims in Newark.
“We are the biggest obstacles we have to transforming this nation. Period,” he said.
However, Booker’s speech was not without optimism. He told the audience about Fathers NOW, a program he founded to help teach men to be better fathers. He said the program has deterred many ex-convicts from returning to prison.
“When we come together, there is nothing we can’t achieve,” Booker said, before recounting the story of a man who pushed drug dealers out of his neighborhood by cleaning up an empty lot used to sell drugs.
Audience response to Booker’s speech was overwhelmingly positive.
“I thought he was really inspirational,” said Erica E. Harrison, a joint-degree student at Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School.
Another law student, Chequan A. Lewis, commented on the significance of Booker’s appearance at the Law School.
“The thing that’s most exciting about Cory Booker is that he personifies the notion that you can come from a highfalutin background and have a ton of degrees but at the end of the day, what you do underground that impacts people is what really counts.”

The Harvard Summer School is going global this June—even for students who will remain on this side of the Charles.
SAST-S140: “Social Development in Pakistan” will bring together Harvard Summer School students and Pakistani activists and scholars through real-time video conferencing between Cambridge and Islamabad.
The course will examine development-based movements throughout Pakistan through a series of three-hour modules.
While the Harvard Summer School offers a variety of summer study abroad programs, this is the first truly “bi-locational” course offered, according to the class syllabus.
“We do have the technology to do this,” said Elisabeth L. Laskin, associate dean for academic affairs at the Harvard Summer School. “But we’ve never done anything like this before, where it’s really a course being offered in real time here and in Islamabad.”
Each year, the Harvard Summer School program accepts course proposals from faculty outside of Harvard. The proposals are passed on to Harvard departments that might be interested in offering credit for the course.
SAST-S140 was proposed by Margaret E. Ronkin, senior fellow of the American Institute of Pakistan Studies, who taught a previous version of this course at Georgetown University.
Speaking from Islamabad, where she is currently conducting research on African-Pakistani constructions of identity, Ronkin said she conceived of the course through conversations with colleagues about negative perceptions of Iraq and Pakistan after 9/11.
“What we really needed,” she said, “was a course that could refocus away, in some way, from the kind of monologic discourse about the war on terror and about national security.”
The course will begin with a weeklong orientation of social development in Pakistan and interview-based research, according to the syllabus. Students will then hear lectures by and conduct interviews with experts in Pakistan through video conferences, on topics ranging from urban development to arts-based initiatives.
Ronkin has been working with her colleagues throughout Pakistan to coordinate guest speakers. So far, the lineup includes Nobel Prize nominee Shoaib Sultan Khan and United Nations Gender Specialist Salman Asif, among others.
Ronkin emphasized the benefits of the unconventional format of the course. “This feeling that you get [from real-time video conferencing] is simply not available in a normal class and form in the same way,” she said. “It’s very real and immediate and personal.”

Students will be housed in three different swing space locations around Harvard Square during the renovation of Old Quincy, administrators announced on Friday.
Hampden Hall at 8 Plympton Street, Fairfax Hall at 1306 Massachusetts Avenue, and Ridgely Hall at 65 Mt. Auburn Street will house the 180 displaced students as Old Quincy undergoes a 15-month renovation project, slated to begin in June 2012.
The buildings, owned and operated by Harvard University Housing, currently serve as apartments for graduate students and visiting faculty. Tenants in the apartments at 8 Plympton Street said that they received an email earlier this year telling them that the building would be unavailable during the 2012-2013 school year.
Proximity to Quincy and the ability of the physical infrastructure of the buildings to recreate a normal House experience were priorities in choosing swing housing, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in an interview on Friday.
“A number of factors went into selecting these buildings as swing space. Ideally, there would have been a building just like Old Quincy nearby, but we are very satisfied that this option will provide students with a positive experience,” Smith said.
Smith added that the current spaces would be slightly touched up to fit the needs of undergraduates, but would not elaborate on how high the costs for the projects would run.
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke said during an interview in January that he will prioritize maintaining a sense of community among students still living in Quincy and those displaced to swing housing throughout the construction process.
“We want to make sure that the Quincy House community is still unified and that the students feel that they still have a House that welcomes them,” Gehrke said.
While these three spaces could be used for future projects that would only take parts of Houses out of commission, Smith said that the considerations for finding housing to accommodate full House renovations are more complicated. He indicated that a “swing House” will need to be created before construction begins on larger House Renewal projects.
According to Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67, administrators have discussed the possibility of creating a new building for swing space to house students during future renovations.
“There aren’t a lot of places near Harvard that can house a full 350 to 400 people,” Smith said.
Old Quincy was selected in December 2010 as a test case for House renewal, serving as a blueprint for future renovation projects for the other neo-Georgian houses.
“This is an experiment, and we will learn a lot from it,” Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 wrote in an email.
The administration has not offered a timeline for the rest of the renovation process, although administrators have said that the start dates of future construction will depend on availability of funding.
The costs for the Quincy renovation project will be covered through investments, donations, and internal FAS funds, which includes the school’s reserves, according to Smith.
Administrators have said that the full House renewal projects will be a top priority for the upcoming capital campaign. Donors and senior administrators said in past interviews that the total cost of the renovation projects would be over a billion dollars.
According to members from the FAS Physical Resources Department, the renovation of Old Quincy will at least include updated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units.
The House Program Planning Committee outlined further possible changes for the Houses, such as introducing “clusters”—large common rooms for students living in singles along a hallway—and eliminating walk-throughs, a rooming setup that requires students to walk through their roommate’s bedroom to reach the bathroom.
“Each House will continue to be unique, but we also believe strongly as we renovate the House system that each student shouldn’t have a different experience,” Smith said of the renovations.
College administrators are currently reviewing the HPPC’s recommendations for future renovations, and they hope to release more developed plans this May, according to Smith.

Alan M. Garber ’76, a Stanford professor of medicine and economics, has been selected as the next University Provost. Garber’s appointment follows current Provost Steven E. Hyman’s announcement last December that he would step down at the end of the academic year in order to return to his research.
“I am excited, energized and very fortunate to have the opportunity to be Harvard’s next provost,” Garber said, adding that he will prioritize the integration of Harvard’s schools and the University’s future development in Allston.
“One of the biggest attractions of this job is the ability to participate in the future of the Allston campus,” Garber said. “I view Allston as an opportunity unlike any other in American higher education today, where there is a campus that can be used to help realize the University’s vision for the future and make this a truly 21st century university.”
A summa cum laude graduate who studied economics at the College, Garber went on to receive his Ph.D. in economics from Harvard and an M.D. from Stanford. During his 25 years on the Stanford faculty, Garber’s academic work has focused mainly on health policy economics. He also has served on a Harvard Medical School and Harvard Dental School visiting committee.
“He has an incisive intellect, a deep appreciation for the challenges facing research universities, and a loyalty and commitment to Harvard, where he has maintained strong ties since his years as an undergraduate in the College,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release. “I am extremely pleased that a person of Alan’s talent, range, and versatility will be joining the University’s senior leadership team.”
Some within the University had speculated that a veteran of Harvard’s faculty would be selected to replace Hyman, whose wide ranging responsibilities require an intimate understanding of the University.
“You have to know the cast of characters and you have to understand the diversity of the different faculty. It is a huge challenge. For anyone to come in cold would be very hard, but a fresh perspective may be very helpful,” said Barry R. Bloom, a former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.
But Garber said Friday that he thinks his experience at Stanford will be a valuable asset and that he expects the transition will be fairly smooth.
“I think that even if I were an insider I would need a tremendous amount of effort in learning about the people and the University,” Garber said. “I take that as a challenge to reach out to the wide diversity of people at the University.”
At Stanford, Garber has worked to form and strengthen ties across academic fields and said he intends to do more of the same at Harvard.
“Historically [Harvard’s] weakness has been that the great independence of the different schools and departments has made it difficult to collaborate on initiatives that cross traditional lines,” Garber said. He added that since his time as an undergraduate at the College in the 70s, the University has made “remarkable progress in interdisciplinary work.”
During her tenure as president, Faust has tried to break down barriers between the University’s various divisions and schools in an effort to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.
“Alan is a distinguished academic leader who brings to Harvard an extraordinary breadth of experience in research across disciplines,” Faust said.
Dean of Harvard Law School Martha L. Minow said in an email that Garber “has demonstrated the power of interdisciplinary work and advanced understanding and policies concerning the delivery of health care.”
“He is also passionately curious and will bring terrific experience and talent for university leadership, creative problem-solving, and thoughtful commitment to advancing human welfare through university research and teaching,” she added.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said, “I think he’ll be tremendously successful here. He’s familiar with the school as an undergraduate and as a PhD student in economics.”
Though his background is in the sciences and social sciences, Garber said that further strengthening Harvard’s humanities and arts curriculum will be a priority.
“I see the humanities as being absolutely central to Harvard’s future,” Garber said.
He said that though Boston’s colder climate will require him to purchase warmer clothing items for his wardrobe, he looks forward to returning to his alma mater and continuing the reorganization of the University’s library system that has been spearheaded by Hyman.
“His service to the academy and to the nation in medical decision-making, science, and policy has been prolific,” Stanford President John L. Hennessy said of Garber in a press release. “I have no doubt he will serve Harvard with the same passion. I congratulate both Alan and Harvard.”

DOMA Liquors reopened on Friday after being closed by tax examiners for selling alcohol to a minor, according Arjun Kunwar, the store’s manager.
When a student attempted to purchase alcohol earlier this week, the employee thought that the student looked “older” and therefore did not card him, according to Amrik S. Pabla, a DOMA employee.
On Thursday morning, tax examiners notified the business that it had violated the law. DOMA was closed for all of Thursday and was allowed to reopen after paying a fine, Kunwar said.
According to Kunwar, this was the first time that DOMA had been caught selling to minors, adding that the employee in question was “new” and “in training.”
Kunwar said that the store will be more stringent in the future in allowing students to purchase alcohol.
“From now on, it’s really strict,” he said of the store’s policy regarding checking IDs.
Students interviewed said that in the past, DOMA has consistently carded people who purchase alcohol.
“I’ve always had my ID checked when I go there,” Samuel B. Novey ’11 said.
DOMA employees said that the store’s policy is always to check IDs, and the store consistently swipes identification to ensure authenticity.
“If they don’t have an ID, we don’t sell to them,” Pabla said.
A sign posted on DOMA’s door on Thursday indicated that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had seized DOMA for “nonpayment of taxes.”
Richard A. Ascolillo Jr., the tax examiner whose card was taped to the door of DOMA, declined to comment on the case.
Another sign on the store’s door, handwritten in purple ink and taped to the door, said that the store was merely “closed for renovation.”
Kunwar said he had no knowledge of the handwritten sign and thinks one of his employees had posted it that day.
DOMA employees declined to comment on the employment status of the person that allegedly sold alcohol to a minor.

Under the tutelage of renowned sexologist Dr. Carol Queen on Friday night, students learned how to induce the female orgasm during the Seventh Annual Female Orgasm Seminar.
It was a night filled with gleaming condom wrappers, savory vagina cupcakes, and the infamous “wondrous vulva puppet.”
The two-hour event organized by the Radcliffe Union of Students was divided into two sections, a seminar led by Queen and an anonymous question and answer session for students. The anonymous Q&A period was conducted through anonymous text message, allowing students to ask their most probing questions about female sexuality from the security of their lecture seats.
During the event over 1,000 condoms and $400 worth of sex toys were distributed to students.
Detailing her accomplishments as a founding director of the Center for Sex and Culture and an owner of the sex shop Good Vibrations, Queen jokingly attributed her own fascination with human sexuality to being raised in rural America.
“I’m a sexological overachiever,” she said. “I grew up way out in the country bored out of my mind.”
After waiting for the laughter to die down, Queen began pulling at her bright red shawl. “I am wearing my cloak of promiscuity ... it looks enough like a vulva that when I do these kinds of talks I love to wear it,” she joked. “I would wear my hood but I’m pretty sure my head would look like a clitoris.”
After another few minutes of jokes, Queen quickly moved to the seminar’s most anticipated topic, the female orgasm. Beginning with the question of what is an orgasm, Queen defined the orgasm as a peak sensation that can occur both within and outside of erotic contexts. All orgasms are not necessarily the same, she said. Some people know when they reach orgasm, while others are unsure.
Metaphors comparing orgasms to erupting volcanos and other earth shattering images can create unrealistic expectations for what the orgasmic experience is like, she said. This causes women, in particular, to think they are not having orgasms or reaching the highest levels of pleasure possible.
Taking out her vulva puppet, queen commented on the puppet’s pillow-like appearance. “You want one for your couch don’t you?” she joked.
Using the puppet, Queen highlighted key areas of the vulva for stimulating orgasms while explaining the role of nerve endings and the human brain in facilitating orgasm.
Transitioning to Q&A, Queen answered audience members’ questions about using vibrators, the importance of penis size, and key differences between g-spot and clitoral orgasms.
In her final remarks, Queen told the audience that it is really important to know their bodies and be comfortable with seeing what works best for them.
“Treating yourself as a science project in these matters is really useful,” she said.

Harvard was called “one of the best motherf—ing party schools” by Yardfest headliner Far East Movement as they performed in front of a record size audience of current and prospective Harvard students last night.
The event, which also featured The White Panda and Sam Adams, was “the largest Yardfest has ever been,” according to College Events Board Chair Crystal Y. Coser ’12, attracting nearly double the number of students compared to last year.
At 5:30 p.m.—the concert’s scheduled start time—few people were gathered near the stage. Instead, most were enjoying the tire swings and picnic dinner provided specifically for the event.
But four minutes later, when The White Panda took the stage, a crowd quickly formed as students rushed to watch the performers.
While wearing panda masks and crisp white formal wear, The White Panda—a mashup duo comprising Tom Evans and Dan Griffith—mixed combinations of various Top 40 songs on their laptops.
By the time Sam Adams—a 21-year-old rapper and Cambridge native—began to perform, the crowd had grown in size and enthusiasm.
“It’s crazy being home,” Adams said during his introduction.
The crowd jumped and cheered as Adams performed remixes of songs like “I Hate College” and “We No Speak Americano.” One student held up an Adams House flag and another held a sign reading “I heart Sammy.”
The crowd erupted as the Far East Movement took the stage and started performing their song “Girls on the Dance Floor.”
Prohgress—one of the group’s members—surfed the crowd during “Like a G6,” the group’s most popular and highly anticipated song.
“Man, you motherf—ers know how to party!” said one of the group members during the performance. “Harvard in the house tonight!”
One song later, the group abruptly left the stage, but returned to sing “Rocketeer,” another of the group’s well-known singles co-written with Bruno Mars and featuring OneRepublic’s Ryan Tedder.
Students said they were happy with this year’s performance, and many said it was better than last year’s.
“Kid Cudi is good,” Kevin J. Chin ’13 said, in reference to last year’s Yardfest headliner. “But Far East Movement is ten times better.”
This year was the first time Yardfest overlapped with Visitas, the admitted student visiting program—which also attracted a record number of prospective Harvard students this year.
“We did our best to throw a great event for Harvard College undergrads, [despite] any scheduling conflicts that arose,” Coser said. “But the prefrosh added more energy.”
One prefrosh was so excited that, as he sat on a friend’s shoulders, he waved a red admitted student folder in the air.
“[Yardfest] was really fun,” said Andrew B. Liu, an admitted student. “It made me change what I thought of Harvard as a party school.”
This year was also the first time the event was held in Old Yard instead of Tercentenary Theater, a change which many students praised because of the additional space for both the picnic dinner and the concert.
During the concert, parents of admitted students crowded around the gates, unable to enter without a student or prefrosh ID.

Students delivered a spectacular combination dance and cat-walk performance amidst intense beats and radiating lights at the annual fashion fundraiser event Eleganza on Saturday night.
The show, which took place at the Lavietes Pavilion, raised $5,000 for the local youth organization Teen Empowerment.
Two youths from the group kicked off Eleganza with a rap about their experiences living in Somerville.
Looks featured on the runway ranged from high fashion to casual wear, from Abercrombie & Fitch to Nicole Miller, from jean shorts to floor-length gowns, and from black dresses to floral prints.
The show, in its 17th year, had a theme of Greek mythology.
The storyline involved a handsome young hero who was seduced by a nymph in red. He chased her through three different worlds­­—Medusa’s lair, the Underworld, and Mount Olympus—to finally discover that she was not who he thought she was.
“It was really cool,” said prefrosh Kathleen P. Da Silva, who was on campus for Visitas, the visiting weekend for prospective students.
“It was a great time,” said Erin D. Drake ’14, who also attended Eleganza during her prefrosh visit last year.
“When you think of Harvard, you don’t think of sexually charged fashion shows,” Drake said.
This year, Drake sat in the V.I.P. section surrounding the runway.
“From the angle in the V.I.P. section, you’re at a party with your friends, but there’s just a half-naked man walking nearby,” she joked. “The people who sat in the V.I.P. section were at a party and a fashion show. The people in the bleachers were just at a fashion show.”
The performances Saturday night also included a high-energy showcase from Ghungroo originally choreographed as a part of the senior dance this year.
The evening also featured an exuberant dance and stepping performance from the Black Men’s Forum Step, a group of Harvard men dedicated to black men’s issues.
Eleganza model Katherine E. Moon ’14 said the performance was as fun to put on as it was to watch.
“We all had a great deal of fun walking and dancing on the runway,” she said. “We never took ourselves too seriously.”
“It’s amazing that such a large-scale production is put together every year for such a great cause,” she said. “[I] feel very lucky to have been given a part in it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard students—including experienced marathoners, unofficial “bandit” runners, and students dressed in burger costumes—participated in the 115th Boston Marathon yesterday.
Wearing a shirt that said “George: Cheer for Me,” George Zisiadis ’11 completed the marathon—spanning 26.2 miles between Hopkinton and Copley Square—in three hours and 51 minutes.
“It’s a unique feeling to have thousands of people yelling your name,” said Zisiadis, who had never run a marathon and only trained for a month.
Zisiadis was one of many “bandit” runners—individuals who join the marathon but are not officially registered.
“We were less running and more partying,” he said.
Jennifer A. Xia ’12 said in an email that she was “still on that running high” hours after the race.
Xia added that she enjoyed the high-energy atmosphere and support along the course.
At Wellesley—the approximate halfway point—the runners passed hundreds of signs that read, “Kiss me, I’m _____,” with different adjectives filling in the blank, according to Xia.
Though she did not run with anyone, “running with the crowd was the next best thing,” she said. “The kids were absolutely adorable.”
Grier W. Tumas ’11 agreed, calling the Boston Marathon “addicting” because of the many people cheering along the way, as well as the many challenges of the course—including the notoriously difficult Heartbreak Hill.
“Every year I finish exhausted but euphoric,” she said.
Rachael L. Goldberg ’12, another participant, said that she enjoyed giving high-fives to “as many kids as possible” on the course.
Vidya B. Viswanathan ’11, a former Crimson news editor, was part of a group of about 15 Harvard students sponsored by b.good. Called the “Burger Brigade,” the students raced in burger and french fry suits to support a homeless empowerment organization called Back on My Feet.
Zisiadis encouraged the marathon-shy to consider participating in the race in the future. “People sell themselves short” when it comes to attempting marathons, he said. “You see people running who look just like you and me.”
The Harvard College Marathon Challenge listed 13 students on its website as officially sponsored runners. The group, which includes Harvard students, employees, and alumni, raises money for the health, education, and welfare of Boston-area youth and families, according to its website. Since 2005-06, HCMC has raised over $195,000.
The fastest runner—Kenyan Geoffry Mutai—set a new unofficial world record by finishing the course in two hours and three minutes yesterday, while Kenya’s Caroline Kilel pulled out a narrow victory in the women’s race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third consecutive Ivy League game, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (7-5, 1-3 Ivy) was competitive till the end. And for the third consecutive Ivy League game, it walked off the field heartbroken.
Three weeks ago, it was a 9-8 loss to Dartmouth after the Big Green beat the Crimson at the buzzer. Last week, it was a blown lead in the final moments of a 13-12 defeat to No. 5 Cornell.
But Saturday’s contest against Penn (6-4, 3-2) might have very well been the worst of those one-goal losses.
After staging a ferocious rally to tie the game with two goals in the final two minutes, the Crimson fell in double overtime to the No. 15 Quakers, 7-6.
With 30 seconds left in the second sudden-death period, Penn midfielder Drew Belinsky came around the net from the right, spun, and beat Harvard sophomore goalie Harry Krieger for the winner, leaving the Crimson players holding their heads in despair as the Quakers mobbed the freshman in front of their goal.
“I’m proud of our kids, but we put ourselves in a hole,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get the lead, couldn’t get the momentum...we didn’t make the plays we had to.”
The low-scoring match was dominated by strong defense on both sides that began early in the contest.
The Quakers’ only goal in the opening period came with 1:07 remaining, when midfielder Al Kohart reset up top, sprinted left in a curl, and fired on the run to beat Krieger. The Harvard defense was strong throughout the quarter, but Penn’s backs were better, shutting out the Crimson attack.
“We just didn’t get in a rhythm,” junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan said. “We didn’t get good shots off on the first few possessions, and they’ve got a good defense. You’ve got to hand it to them.”
The Quakers took a 2-0 lead early in the second after Crimson sophomore Peter Berg was called for pushing. Penn attack Corey Winkoff took advantage of the man-up opportunity, getting Krieger to fall for a high fake before putting it past him low for the score.
Harvard finally got on the board with 3:32 left in the quarter, when sophomore Alex White fired a shot past Quaker goalie Brian Feeney to cut the Penn lead in half.
Neither team was able to score for the remainder of the period, as the Quakers had a man-up possession in the final minute but was unable to get a shot off.
“I’m really proud of our defensive effort,” Wojcik said. “We really locked them down.”
The scoring began to pick up in the third.
At 13:09, co-captain Dean Gibbons fired a cross-field pass to Vaughan on the right side, and Vaughan went low with a side-arm shot to beat Feeney and tie the game at 2-2.
Four minutes later, the Quakers responded when Will Koshanksy saw a wide-open lane down the middle and was able to score. Penn added another tally with 5:57 left, when Belinsky took a pass from Rob Fitzpatrick in front, and, in one motion, fired the ball past Krieger to put Penn up 4-2.
But Harvard rallied to tie the contest. At 2:31, junior Terry White took a pass on the right side, made a move around his defender, and beat Feeney for the goal. Under a minute later, freshman Peter Schwartz wrapped around the net and sent a shot under the crossbar to even the game at 4-4 heading into the final period.
“No matter what, we always fight back,” Wojcik said. “That’s a characteristic of this team during the course of the season.”
The Quakers jumped back ahead 12:16 into the fourth on a Morgan Griff goal. Neither team scored for nearly 10 minutes after that, until Griff came from behind the pipes and added his second of the contest to put Penn up, 6-4, with 2:46 remaining.
But the Crimson would not give in. With 1:51 to go, Vaughan came around the net curling left, and while being tackled, went low to beat Feeney.
After a fight for a ground ball on the ensuing faceoff gave Harvard possession, the Crimson called timeout to set up a play. The strategy session paid off, as with 52 seconds left in the game, sophomore Ryan Stevens hit Gibbons, who fired a lefty shot past Feeney that he followed with a big fist pump of jubilation.
The Crimson won the subsequent faceoff again, but Stevens missed wide left, giving Penn the final possession of regulation. But Krieger made a catch save with four seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.
“Harry played outstanding,” Wojcik said. “I’m very proud of him, he really made a number of big saves.”
In the first extra session, both goalies made tough saves, and Terry White missed wide and then turned it over on Harvard’s final two possessions, sending the game into double overtime.
Krieger made a save on a Kohart shot early in the second extra session. But Feeney responded with a save on a Gibbons attempt, returning possession to the Quakers, who won on Belinsky’s goal.
“You can’t hold them to two in the first half, seven overall and not win those games,” Vaughan said. “It’s very frustrating ... yeah, we’ve come back and made it close the last few games, but we lost, so it doesn’t mean much.”
The third consecutive Ivy loss could potentially be catastrophic to Harvard’s chances of making the four-team Ivy League tournament, and it sets up must-win games against Princeton and Yale the next two weeks. But it could take a while for the Crimson to recover from another agonizing defeat.
“This [loss] is a little different,” Vaughan said. “Our defense really buckled down and had an unbelievable day, Harry Krieger was an absolute stud in goal, and it’s just another one of those games where we didn’t get anything going, we didn’t put everything together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team came out the gates firing, taking a commanding 5-0 lead, which proved to be too much for favored No. 12 Princeton.
With the 9-8 victory Saturday at Princeton Stadium, the Crimson (7-4, 4-1 Ivy) clinched a spot in the Ivy League tournament and moved into a second-place tie with Dartmouth in the Ivy League standings.
“We knew it was going to be an even game,” sophomore Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “[But] I think we knew if we stuck to the game plan and played our game, it was going to be close, and we should come out on top.”
Princeton (6-5, 3-1) has been a strong team throughout the year, entering the weekend matchup undefeated in Ivy League play and with losses only to teams ranked in the top 12 in the country.
The Crimson got off to a quick start, taking a 1-0 lead two minutes into the game off a free-position goal by sophomore Danielle Tetreault.
VanderMeulen then took over the game, scoring three unassisted goals in the span of just over five minutes, giving Harvard a 4-0 lead with 19:02 left in the half.
“We haven’t come out hard in a couple of games,” VanderMeulen said. “This game I was determined to set our pace early and set our pace fast. I was lucky that I had some open lanes to go, and I was successful.”
Junior tri-captain Melanie Baskind added another score for the Crimson, pushing the lead to 5-0 with 16:35 left in the half.
But two scores by sophomore Jaci Gassaway and one goal by sophomore Charlotte Davis led the Tigers’ comeback, as Princeton tallied three consecutive goals to cut the Harvard lead to 5-3.
Tetreault ended the rally with her second goal, giving the Crimson a 6-3 halftime lead.
Coming out of the break, Baskind won the opening faceoff and sprinted straight to the goal, where she put one past the goalie only eight seconds into the second half.
But following Baskind’s goal, both defenses tightened up, as neither team scored over the next seven and a half minutes. Gassaway ended the drought by netting her third score for Princeton with 22:37 remaining.
VanderMeulen came back with a quick response, firing one past the Tigers’ goalie on an unassisted tally only 49 seconds later.
The teams traded scores with Tigers’ junior Cassie Pyle putting one on the board for Princeton and Crimson junior Tyler Petropulos answering, setting the score at 9-5 Harvard.
The Petropulos goal came off a forced turnover by Crimson freshman Lauren Tomkinson who picked up the ground ball and found Baskind who assisted the score.
But the Tigers were not done. Behind a strong defense and timely scoring, Princeton mounted a second comeback.
Senior Lizzy Drumm cut into the lead with her goal at 13:35, and 31 seconds later, Pyle notched an unassisted score to cut the lead to 9-7.
Both defenses clamped down in the next nine and a half minutes, until Davis scored her second goal of the game with 3:26 left to cut Harvard’s lead to one.
The goal put the Crimson on the edge of losing its big lead and set the stage for a tight finish.
“I think our team has learned to react well to pressure and view situations that like as being fun and not scary,” Baskind said. “We have been there before and it’s exciting. We are an exciting team to watch.”
The Tigers had a great opportunity to tie the game with what appeared to be a one-on-one attack by junior goalie Kerry Clark, but defenders freshman Alexa Buckley and junior Ellen Gleason swamped the attacker, and Buckley forced the turnover, which allowed Harvard to pick up the grounder and run out the clock.
“With a one-goal lead, it always a little uncomfortable,” VanderMeulen said. “We made some silly mistakes in the last three minutes that put ourselves in jeopardy. But I think we came together collectively, and this was a huge team win.”
Despite the close score, Harvard dominated the game, outshooting Princeton 28-12, winning 14 of 19 draws, and grabbing 20 grounders to only 13 for Princeton.
“Huge game for us,” Baskind said. “We have played a in a bunch of one-goal games so far this year, and unfortunately, we haven’t been able to pull out all the wins.” A win in a close, competitive game against a team like [Princeton] is huge for our confidence going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing a stern test in No. 5 Georgetown last week, the No. 4 Radcliffe lightweights went up against stiff competition once again this weekend against No. 7 Buffalo and defending women’s lightweight national champions No. 2 Stanford. In heavyweight competition, Radcliffe faced off against its most diverse group of competitors so far this season in the Charles River Challenge.
NO. 4 RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 2 STANFORD, NO. 7 BUFFALO
Undefeated up to this point, the Black and White lightweight first varsity eight finally met its match in the Cardinal. Radcliffe and Stanford were both aware that a victory on the water and the capture of the Class of 2010 Invitational Cup would be key to setting the tone of competition between the two perennial national title contenders for the rest of the season.
The chilly Saturday morning was rife with strong tailwinds that provided challenging conditions for all the crews on the Charles.
Because of the conditions, the race was moved from the basin to the Powerhouse Stretch, with the teams racing 1,500 meters instead of 2,000.
“It was just a really challenging weekend,” lightweight co-captain Leah Schwartz said. “There was just a lot of wind in both our races to the point where they had to be moved [in location].”
After a demanding day, the Black and White lightweights came up short against the Cardinal and ceded control of the Cup to Stanford once again. The loss gave the Radcliffe lightweights their first loss of the season.
At the outset of Saturday’s varsity eight race, the Black and White matched the Cardinal stroke for stroke, racing evenly with Stanford as both crews approached the 500-meter mark. But the Cardinal eventually established its brutally efficient rhythm on the water, enabling it to surge ahead and seize victory with a 4:42.4 finish. Radcliffe clocked in six seconds behind at 4:48.4
The Black and White lightweight second varsity eight defeated its Stanford counterpart with a 4:55.0 finish. The Cardinal would clock in nearly five seconds behind in 4:59.8.
The second day of competition brought about a change in fortunes for the Black and White. Although the conditions on the Charles still remained quite treacherous, with a gusting headwind and whitecaps, the Radcliffe crews proved to be up to the test, as the varsity eight and the Black and White second varsity both finished ahead of No. 7 Buffalo Sunday morning on the Charles River Basin.
In this race, both of the Radcliffe Lightweight crews started together on the line against the solitary Bulls crew. The Radcliffe varsity crew got off the line very quickly and led throughout the race, while the Black and White second varsity initially trailed the Bulls but eventually passed Buffalo 900 meters into the race.
At the conclusion of the race, the Radcliffe varsity eight emerged victorious with a time of 8:18.7, the second varsity eight finished in second in a time of 8:34.7, and the Bulls came in 11.2 seconds behind the second Varsity eight in 8:34.7.
No. 16 RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS at CHARLES RIVER CHALLENGE
At the Charles River Challenge this past weekend, the Black and White was pitted against regional opponents Dartmouth, Northeastern, and Syracuse, along with out-of-region guests No. 10 Ohio State and Minnesota.
On Saturday, despite messy conditions on the Charles that looked to derail the Black and White crews, the Radcliffe varsity eight rallied from two boat-stopping crabs—or jammed oars—to finish in second place, ahead of the Gophers and the Orange in a time of 6:45.3. The Big Green finished a little under seven seconds ahead of the Black and White to win the race and the O’Leary Cup for the third time.
With a second-place finish, the Black and White captured a berth to the final race of the Invitational where it faced No. 10 Ohio State, Dartmouth and Northeastern.
On Sunday, the Black and White proved its mettle by moving through the Buckeyes, Big Green, and Huskies. Ohio State took an early lead in the race, with Radcliffe, Dartmouth, and Northeastern slightly behind.
But 500 meters into the race, the Black and White took its first  major move of the race to take the lead. Radcliffe’s next push, which came at the 1,000-meter mark, gave it a lead of nearly a boat length, leaving the Big Green and Buckeyes to battle for second place.
The Black and White finished with a time of 7:09.1, with Ohio State and Dartmouth finishing 7:11.5 and 7:12.2, respectively. The Huskies would finish last with a time of 7:23.7.
The victory avenged the Big Green’s defeat of Radcliffe in Saturday’s tough conditions and also gave the Black and White its biggest win of the season with its defeat of the 10th-ranked Buckeyes.
“Winning is always a step in right direction,” said Radcliffe heavyweight coach Liz O’Leary. “That’s what we wanted to accomplish this weekend and the varsity crew accomplished that. But now we have to start looking towards the next weekend.”
Next weekend, the Black and White will race against rival Yale for the Case Cup.
“Yale beat Ohio State by more than we did, so Yale has clearly found some speed that they didn’t have earlier in the season,” O’Leary said. “Hopefully, we have too and we’ll have a good race with them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last out-of-state tournament before the playoffs, Harvard women’s water polo finished 1-2 during its two days of competition at the University of Maryland.
The Crimson (15-12, 2-1 CWPA Southern) had little trouble against George Washington (6-16, 0-4) in its first game of the weekend.
But Harvard’s next two opponents—Indiana (19-11, 3-2) on Saturday and Maryland (16-13, 3-0) yesterday morning—were much tougher opponents. The Crimson kept both games close, but couldn’t pull out a win in either, ending the weekend on a two-game losing streak.
“I think for us, we didn’t change anything, game-plan wise between Indiana and Maryland,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “You don’t have to get the girls to get up for teams like Maryland and Indiana [because] they’re in the top 20 teams in the country.”
MARYLAND 12, HARVARD 10
After taking an early lead and keeping the game competitive through the first half, Harvard allowed five goals in the third quarter and wasn’t able to come back, losing, 12-10.
Freshman Shayna Price led the team with three goals, and sophomores Elise Molnar and Aisha Price each hit two of their own. But in spite of the strong offensive showing from the three, the Terps hung on to clinch the CWPA Southern Division title.
The Crimson held a 6-5 lead going into halftime. At the start of the second half, Maryland capitalized on its opportunities, according to Minnis.
“[We] had a stretch in the third quarter [when] we had a couple of turnovers that led to a couple of goals for them and got us behind by a couple,” Minnis said.
With five goals in the game between them, the Price sisters capped a productive offensive weekend.
“They’re not pressing—they’re letting the game come to them,” Minnis said. “They see their defense is giving them space, and they’re filling that space, and they’re taking the shots they’re supposed to take and putting them away.”
No. 13 INDIANA 14, HARVARD 8
Down by just one at the half, Harvard couldn’t keep up with the Hoosiers in the final two quarters, dropping Saturday’s second game, 14-8.
The Crimson trailed by a score of 6-5 after a four-goal second-half performance. But Harvard only scored three more for the rest of the game, and the nationally-ranked Indiana team scored eight to take the six-goal victory.
“We like playing those tough games,” junior co-captain Devan Kennifer said. “I think if we had played them in the first game of the day, it would have maybe even been a little bit better, because we were relatively tired from the first.”
Kennifer knocked in three goals for her second hat trick of the day. Shayna Price was the Crimson’s only other player to score multiple goals, converting twice to give her four for the day.
“It was really good for us in terms of getting confidence in playing really good teams, because we know at this point that we can hang with pretty much anyone,” Kennifer said.
Indiana’s Nicole Redder led all scoring with four goals, and Jakie Kohli hit three of her own. The three goals gave Kohli six total on Saturday after scoring three earlier in the day against Brown.
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 11
In the first game of the weekend, the Crimson had little trouble with the Colonials, holding a comfortable lead for most of the game before pulling away in the fourth quarter to take the win.
The Price sisters scored a combined five goals, and Kennifer added a hat trick of her own to continue a streak of dominance over GW. Harvard hasn’t lost to the Colonials since 2004.
“The Price sisters have really awesome shots, and kind of comically similar shots,” Kennifer said. “They’ve got guns, and it’s really awesome when they come out shooting.”
After ending the first quarter in a 2-2 tie, the Crimson took a one-goal lead into the half. Harvard never blew the game open, but GW also never seriously threatened Harvard’s lead after the half.
“They are much better than they have been in the past…so we were ready for a better team,” Kennifer said. “They came out and they were really good…We were pretty dominant the entire game, but the score didn’t quite show it.”
The season so far has been one of the Crimson’s best in the past few years, but the team has had its struggles away from Cambridge. Harvard is 7-0 at home, but it hasn’t had the same success on the road, with an 8-11 record after Saturday’s first game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In more ways than one, the stories of this year’s Harvard men’s volleyball team and its four-game thriller on Saturday have been ones of perseverance.
The Crimson (9-13, 1-7 EIVA Hay) rebounded from a tough third set to beat the New Jersey Institute of Technology, 3-1, Saturday afternoon at the Malkin Athletic Center.
With the victory, Harvard avenged a 3-1 defeat last week to the Highlanders (7-20, 1-7 Hay).
Up 20-16 in the third set, the Crimson looked poised to sweep NJIT. While the score spoke of a closer set, Harvard had been dominant.
The Crimson players electrified the crowd with their play, setting up one another for several kills and coming up with some crucial blocks on the Highlanders’ hitters.
But the momentum shifted in NJIT’s favor when sophomore Kevin Van Oss found his hitting rhythm and led his team to a comeback.
The Highlanders made quick work of spoiling Harvard’s lead and closed out the set, 25-23.
“We were up, and when we let that one go, everybody on the court felt like it was our fault,” said senior middle blocker Shaun Mansour. “They hadn’t really beaten us. We just lost to ourselves. So, when we got back on the court for the fourth game, we weren’t thinking about just beating them; we wanted to destroy them.”
Sure enough, the Crimson’s performance in the fourth set was nothing short of destruction.
In part due to an impressive display of serving by junior co-captain Matt Jones, the team jumped out to a 12-2 lead over its opponents, taking the momentum back.
While NJIT would come back to within seven points of Harvard later on in the set, the Crimson’s form ultimately overwhelmed the Highlanders’ cohesion.
Harvard was able to take advantage of several errors in communication to secure a steady advantage, and—unlike in the last match—when the Crimson came close to clinching victory, this time it closed.
With his team up by eight points and needing just one to secure victory, Mansour, Harvard’s lone senior, concluded his collegiate career with an impressive kill.
“The team has a lot of good chemistry,” Mansour said. “I knew that when it came down to it, the team knew how much it would mean to me to have a part in the win, and I knew that Rob [Lothman] would try to get me the ball if he could. When it came up, I was ready.”
In the end, the Crimson closed the match with a 25-16 win in the fourth set, ending its season with its first conference win of the year.
“Win or lose, the match was up to us,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We didn’t focus on the opponent; [we] just worried about our side of the net. The guys came out, and it really worked. I felt we played with a lot of confidence and a lot of consistency.”
Interestingly enough, confidence and consistency have been the plague of this season’s squad.
Like its quick 6-1 start to the season, the Crimson began the match well Saturday afternoon, boasting a two-set advantage after cruising past NJIT with solid 25-19 and 25-21 wins in the first and second frames, respectively.
Though it had trouble breaking out of its slump later in the season, Harvard proved its mettle in the team’s final contest.
“We slipped back into our old habits a bit in the third game, giving up points in streaks to the other team,” Baise said. “I was curious to see how the team would respond in the last game, and to watch them turn it around like they did was great.”
Without a doubt, Jones was the standout of the match, leading the team with 24 kills and leading the squad through the adversity of the third set. Jones also recorded two service aces, five digs, and six blocking assists.
Other notable performers were freshman outside hitter Chris Gibbons, who added 13 kills, led the team with 11 digs, and contributed to a blocking assist, and sophomore Derek Jansma who led the team with 27 assists.
“This is a young team that proved they can come out and play to their potential,” Baise said. “This win will be a great thing not only for the end of this season, but [also] to start next fall.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the Harvard women’s golf team turned its season around, rebounding from a mediocre finish in the previous tournament to nearly win for the first time all season.
This weekend, it was the men’s team to pull off exactly the same feat—except the men did one better.
After a disappointing eighth-place finish at the Princeton Invitational last week, the Crimson men’s golf team dramatically stepped up its game, shooting a 628 at the Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., to win the Century Intercollegiate Tournament. The victory, which spanned Saturday and Sunday, marked Harvard’s first this season.
Freshman Seiji Liu led the way for Harvard, shooting a two-day total of 152 on the par-71 course. Liu’s +10 performance was good enough to win the tournament, with the freshman placing first in a field of 45 golfers.
Last weekend, Liu struggled, finishing in 40th place. But something seemed to click for the freshman this weekend.
“I putted terribly last week,” Liu said. “I turned my putting around…[when] my coach gave me a fix.”
“He just figured things out,” freshman Theo Lederhausen added. “Coming out of the winter, he had a few technical things [that] were kind of misaligned…He straightened [them] out, and now he’s playing well.”
The Crimson started off the tournament on the right foot. The team shot a score of 319 on Saturday, which gave Harvard the top spot going into the second day. While +35 was the Crimson’s worst single-day finish of the year, the tough conditions turned what would usually be a below-average score into a tournament-leading one.
The weather was brutal, to say the least. Players had to contend with a gusting wind, heavy rain, and intense cold. Additionally, the course itself was challenging.
The combination of a tough course and harsh weather “tore the field apart,” Liu said.
In fact, in the Princeton Invitational, 12 players had three-round totals of +5 or less. But in Saturday’s round, not one player broke +6.
Perhaps no team felt the weather’s effects on Saturday more than Yale. After firing a -4 overall as a team to win the Princeton Invitational, Yale shot a +40 on Saturday. What’s more, the two Bulldog golfers who led last week’s tournament, shooting -5 and -3, finished the first round this weekend +9 and +10, respectively.
Despite the team’s troubles, Yale remained very much in contention after day one, finishing in second place, five strokes behind the Crimson. Princeton finished the day in third with a 326.
Harvard earned the low score on Saturday thanks in large part to the play of Liu and Lederhausen. Liu seemed rather unfazed by the weather, tying for the tournament low with a 77.
Lederhausen wasn’t far behind, finishing fifth with a strong 79.
“He’s basically our leading player and our most consistent player, so it’s always good to see him play well,” Liu said.
The next day didn’t go quite as well for the Crimson. In the end, Harvard did just enough to win, shooting a 309 in yesterday’s final round.
But George Washington nearly spoiled the Crimson’s day. Dropping 27 strokes from its performance on Saturday, the Colonials shot a 301 yesterday, losing to Harvard by just one stroke. Yale, which shot a 310, finished in third with a 634.
Conditions were tough again in the competition’s second day. With heavy winds that made putting difficult, no player in the field shot par or below.
Again, Liu played well despite the weather, tying for the low score for the Crimson. His 75 gave him a two-day total of 152, one shot better than the second-place finisher.
“You need guys who just buckle down and try to grind out a score that you might not love in great conditions but is certainly a good score for the way it was playing out there,” said junior captain Tony Grillo, who also shot a 75. “And Seiji did that both days.”
But individual victory was hardly assured for the freshman, who started the round +5 after the first six holes. Liu recovered, going -1 the rest of the way.
“I was extremely proud of the fact that I kept focused,” Liu said. “I just kept grinding.”
In the end, Lederhausen finished eighth overall, Grillo placed in ninth, and junior Mark Pollak finished in 19th.
Harvard’s finish bodes auspiciously for the team’s next and perhaps most important tournament of the season: the Ivy League Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams braved a cold, rainy afternoon to turn in strong performances on Saturday in New Haven, Conn., delivering historic victories over Yale in the annual Harvard-Yale dual meet. Both the men’s and women’s squads cruised to victory, as the women posted an impressive final score of 113 to Yale’s 50, while the men thrashed the Bulldogs, 106-57.
For the Crimson women, Saturday’s win marked their third consecutive victory against rival Yale, while their male counterparts celebrated the end of an eight-year losing streak against the Bulldogs.
“We were pretty happy with how the meet turned out,” said senior distance runner Dan Chenoweth. “We hadn’t won in the past few years, so we really looking forward to going there and getting a win. And coming away with a win in that fashion was a good thing.”
Leading the Harvard women to victory were freshman sprinters Christina Twicken, Chelsea Celistan, and Meisha Brooks, who teamed up with junior jumper Olivia Weeks to kick off the day with a victory in the 4x100-meter relay in a time of 48.25—nearly a second faster than the Bulldogs’ entry.
Freshman sprinter Olivia Abbate then added to the Crimson’s points total, picking up a victory in the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 15.44. In the women’s 100-meter dash, Celistan and junior sprinter Shannon Conway finished 1-2—within .01 seconds of each other—to increase the gap between Harvard and the host Bulldogs. Later in the day Conway would lead a Harvard sweep in the women’s 200-meter run, finishing in 25.34 ahead of teammates Brooks (25.72) and Twicken (25.86).
However, the Crimson women’s distance runners were not to be outdone by the sprinters. In the women’s 3000-meter run, senior distance runner Claire Richardson and junior distance runner Kailyn Kuzmuk broke away from the pack early in the race and never looked back. They ended up finishing 1-2, with Richardson posting a winning time of 9:55.84 and Kuzmuk finishing seconds behind in 9:57.04.
On the field, the Harvard women were similarly dominant, as they emerged victorious in every field event. Sophomore pole vault Sydnie Leroy captured the pole vault for the Crimson with a substantial 3.70-meter clearance. Weeks also emerged victorious in both the long jump (5.68 meters) and the triple jump (11.91 meters). In the high jump, sophomore Mary Hirst and senior Dina Emde finished 1-2, while freshman thrower Hannah Mayer led a 1-2-3 Harvard sweep with a mark of 43.89 meters in the javelin.
Closing out the day for the Crimson women were freshman thrower Alysha Johnson–who posted the sixth-best mark in school history in the shot put at 13.04 meters—and sophomore Shannon Watt—who gave Harvard its final victory during the last event of the meet in the women’s discus with a distance of 41.97 meters.
Like the women, the men established their dominance over Yale throughout the day with strong showings by the men’s runners, throwers and jumpers. The men captured their first win of the meet with a Harvard podium sweep in the 110-meter hurdles led by sophomore hurdler Scott Sansovich in a time of 15.56, supported by second-place freshman Timothy Moan (16.02) and third-place freshman Caleb Galoozis (16.87). Later in the day, Moan would feature in another Harvard podium sweep in the men’s 400-meter hurdles, as he finished third behind teammates junior Robert Pais (56.15) and sophomore Julian Sherwin (59.83) who took first and second, respectively.
Not to be outdone by the hurdlers, the upperclassmen middle-distance trio of co-captain Brian Hill and juniors Darcy Wilson and Brian Paison finished 1-2-3 to sweep the podium of the men’s 800-meter race.
In the men’s 5000-meter run, Chenoweth led the field from start to finish, and finished nearly 23 seconds ahead of his closest competitors. Chenoweth was one of four Crimson long-distance runners who finished atop the leaderboard in the event.
Similar to their female teammates, the Crimson men went a perfect 8-of-8 in the field, led by a dominant performance from junior thrower Nick Farnsworth, who won the men’s javelin with a distance of 64.51 meters—nearly 25 meters more than the second-place finisher.
I think it was a really important step for us to have that kind of effort as a team,” Harvard coach Jason Saresky said. “It bodes well for us now as we go into the Ivy League Championship in a few weeks and then at the national level as well.”
Next weekend, Harvard will send runners to the West Coast to the Brutus Hamilton Invitational in Berkeley, Calif., and to Princeton, N.J., to compete in the Larry Ellis Invitational.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s tennis team demonstrated this weekend, all-time records often have little bearing on the winner of the current matchup.
The Crimson faced off against the Yale Bulldogs and the Brown Bears this weekend in the 90th and 80th meetings between the teams, respectively.
Harvard (14-10, 3-3 Ivy) picked up a 5-2 win on Friday in New Haven, Conn., against Yale (10-11, 2-4) to go up in the head-to-head record, 64-26.
The Crimson, however, could not carry the momentum forward against Brown (15-6, 2-4).
Harvard had held an impressive 73-6 edge in past meetings going into yesterday’s matchup, but it lost its final home match of the season to the Bears, 4-3.
“They were both good matches,” assistant coach Andrew Rueb said. “The league this year has been astonishingly close. I don’t think it’s ever seen this many 4-3 matches. With that razor edge of difference, sometimes you’re on the winning side, and sometimes you’re on the losing side.”
BROWN 4, NO. 65 HARVARD 3
Harvard started the matchup against Brown by picking up the doubles point for the second time in two matches this weekend.
Junior Ali Felton and sophomore Andy Nguyen dominated their opposing pair, 8-3, to earn the squad’s first win yesterday afternoon.
Captain Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Casey MacMaster followed up with an 8-6 victory, capturing the doubles point on a Brown forced error off of Omodele-Lucien’s big serve on match point.
The Crimson, however, did not produce the same level of play in the singles, as four of Harvard’s six players lost their matches.
Felton and Nguyen both lost in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2 and 6-3, 6-3, respectively. Omodele-Lucien progressed through the first set easily, taking it, 6-1, but his opponent, Sam Fife, turned the match on its head in the second and third sets.
Despite fighting off three break points early on in the third set, Omodele-Lucien dropped the last five games for a 1-6, 6-1, 6-1 loss.
Junior Jon Pearlman and sophomore Josh Tchan were the two singles winners for the Crimson. The two players had to battle—especially in the second set—but they both pulled out 6-2, 6-4 victories.
“There was a long game of about 10 or 15 deuce points at 3-all when he was serving, and I think it wore him down,” Pearlman said. “After that game, I won the next four games pretty easily. I think he was fatigued from that game and I put the pressure on him too.”
The outcome of the dual came down to MacMaster’s match.
The match was close, and MacMaster fought back from the brink of defeat, but he eventually lost the match, 7-5, 7-5.
NO. 65 HARVARD 5, YALE 2
After dropping the doubles point to Princeton last weekend that resulted in a 4-3 loss, Harvard came out strong on Friday in the tandem matches.
Two of the Crimson duos picked up key wins to score Harvard’s first point of the afternoon.
Felton and Nguyen earned the first win, 8-3, which would be the duo’s first of two match wins this weekend.
Pearlman and Tchan followed with another victory against, Erik Blumenkranz and Joel Samaha, 8-5 to secure the first point for the Crimson.
The same four players who came out victorious in their doubles matches also managed to pull out wins in their respective singles matches.
All four players managed to pull through in straights.
Playing at the No. 1 spot, Pearlman cruised through the first set, 6-1, but had to battle in the second set. He eventually prevailed to earn a point for Harvard, 6-1, 7-5.
Felton won in two sets that both went to tiebreakers, 7-6, 7-6. The win gave Felton his 21st match victory of the season.
Tchan and Nguyen, the two other Crimson winners, also pulled out victories in impressive fashion. Tchan dropped just five games on his way to a 6-3, 6-2 win against Jordan Abergel.
Nguyen also dominated his opponent for a 6-3, 6-4 win.
MacMaster, one of the only two Harvard players to lose a match on the day, ended his seven-match winning streak with a 7-6, 6-3 loss to Daniel Hoffman.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its chance at the Ivy title on the line, the No. 66 Harvard women’s tennis team (9-8, 4-2 Ivy) kept pace this weekend in the race for the championship—first starting off slowly but sprinting to success in the end.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 3
When the women took the court yesterday to face No. 45 Brown (15-8, 4-2), the Crimson was in a must-win situation—a victory in Providence would rejuvenate Harvard’s championship hopes, and a loss would have dashed them completely.
But when the stakes were high, the team’s sharp play was able to pull out a 4-3 victory over the Bears, keeping the hungry Crimson in contention for the Ancient Eight crown.
In the doubles matches, Harvard spared no time to start scoring, claiming the point with strong showings in the No. 1 and No. 3 matches.
The duo of freshman Natalie Blosser and sophomore Alexandra Lehman dismantled its opponents, 8-6, at the No. 3 spot, and sophomores Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton, the Crimson’s top twosome, were able to pull out a 9-8 nail-biter against a strong Brown pair.
“Overall, I think the whole match was very indicative of the team’s fight,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “They all practiced hard all week and played to their potential to grab that point.”
In the No. 6 match, freshman Hannah Morrill looked to set the tone, making quick work of her opponent. Morrill toppled Brown junior Julie Flanzer in two sets, 6-4, 6-2.
But the Bears would bounce back, sweeping the Crimson in the next three matches and taking both the lead and the momentum from the visitors.
Both Blosser and junior Samantha Gridley suffered tough losses, the former falling, 6-2, 6-2, in her No. 4 match. The latter lost in the first set, 6-2, and then was shut out in the second to lose the No. 5 point.
In the No. 3 match, Norton got off to a great start against Brown junior Cassandra Herzberg, winning the first set, 7-5.
In the second, Herzberg responded, forcing a third set with a 6-4 finish, and posting a 6-3 score to take the match for the Bears.
The day’s victor was to be decided in the top two matchups.
Junior co-captain Holly Cao made up for her earlier loss in doubles with a 6-2, 6-2, win on the No. 1 court. Then, exchanging 6-1 sets to force a third set at the No. 2 spot, Tachibana proved just enough to outdo her opposition, squeaking out a 6-4 win over senior Bianca Aboukabare to clinch the victory for her team.
YALE 6, HARVARD 1
Hosting No. 33 Yale (20-4, 5-1) on Friday, the Harvard squad faced an old rival—its highest-ranked opponent of the season—in a tough battle where not enough seemed to work in the home squad’s favor.
Playing for the doubles point, the Crimson started off successfully in the No. 1 match, where Tachibana and Norton breezed past their opposition, 8-2.
But success was much harder to find for the other pairs. Harvard fell at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, 8-6 and 8-4, respectively, conceding the point to the visiting Bulldogs.
“When it came to the crucial moments I think they stepped up to the plate,” Cao said. “The games were close, but they capitalized on the big moments.”
The singles matches told a similar story.
Despite Cao’s impressive performance in the top match, good enough for a pair of 6-3 finishes and the Crimson’s sole singles point, the rest of the roster couldn’t match up to their Yale counterparts.
Gridley was overwhelmed by a score of 6-4, 6-4, at the No. 6 spot, and Norton was dismantled by her opponent on the No. 3 court, 6-2, 6-0.
Harvard managed to fight a little closer in the day’s other matchups, coming up short by narrow margins.
After losing the first set, 6-3, Morrill came back to win the second by a score of 6-1 to force a third set in the No. 5 match. The third proved just too much though, and she fell, 6-2, to drop the point for the team.
Blosser experienced a similar fate at No. 4, down in the first, 6-3, and then rebounding to win, 6-4, in the second. But, like for Morrill, the third set seemed one too many for Blosser, and a 10-4 loss to junior Stephanie Kent added to the Crimson’s deficit.
The No. 2 matchup ultimately sealed the deal for the day, and Tachibana fell, 6-2, 7-6, with  Harvard losing overall to the Bulldogs, 6-1.
“I felt like we left all we had on the court in those close doubles matches,” Green said. “But in the singles, Yale just outplayed us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite losing its first two Ivy League matchups of the weekend, Harvard came back to break even and close out its weekend on a high note.
The Crimson defeated Brown in the last two games of a four-game series with the Bears, as Harvard used 25 hits on Sunday to earn solid positioning in the league with Ivy competition nearing its end.
“We lost some heartbreaking games [Saturday],” senior catcher Cole Arledge said. “But we started to play at a higher level. The bats came alive, and it was really great to see us finally hit the ball the way we all know that we can.”
HARVARD 12, BROWN 7
In the nightcap of the weekend’s second day, Harvard went up in the first inning, 4-0, landing the Bears in a deficit from which they could not recover.
Though Brown picked up a run in the bottom of the first, the 4-1 hole would not be filled.
Freshman Jack Colton, senior Dillon O’Neill, and junior Jeff Reynolds contributed three hits each in the Sunday’s second matchup to lead Harvard over the Bears.
Senior pitcher Ben Sestanovich earned the win for Harvard, securing the final 5.1 innings for Harvard on the way to the win.
“The bats just came alive tonight,” Arledge said. “[Sestanovich] finished a complete ballgame ... and we’re not going to win games if we can’t play until the finish.”
Brown staged two-run comebacks in the third, fourth, and sixth innings, but Harvard held off the attack to finish on top for the second time this weekend.
“We’re excited about the two wins,” co-captain Albright added. “We know we can play like we did [yesterday]. Now, we have nothing to play for except knowing that we can play well. We hope to take some of the momentum we gained today and use it for the rest of the season.”
HARVARD 6, BROWN 3
In the morning on Sunday, Harvard came out ready to play, scoring four times against the Bears in the seventh inning as the Crimson topped Brown for the first time this year.
Harvard dominated both of Sunday’s matchups, scoring in nine of 16 innings on the second day of competition, and the Bears were stymied early by junior pitcher Brent Suter’s complete-game, seven-strikeout effort.
“We really need to take things one game at a time,” Arledge said. “Sometimes we’re too focused on the big picture. Brent Suter came out to win one game for the sake of winning one game ... As a team, we still have a lot to play for.”
“I really think we need to just play our game,” Arledge added. “It’s more fun to win. The momentum that we have now with the bat will help us a lot. We’re getting hits, and that gives us great momentum. Hopefully, we’ll be able to go off of the confidence we’ve developed with the bat. We had a hitting coach come talk to us—Walt Hriniak—who really took our team’s mentality to the next level.”
BROWN 4, HARVARD 3
Though the two teams entered the ninth inning of Saturday’s nightcap tied, 3-3, a late Bears run pushed the second game of the series away from the Crimson.
Two runs in the seventh led Brown back from a 3-1 deficit to tie the game. Eventually, Brown pulled away from the Crimson with a ninth inning run on a Harvard error.
Though senior pitcher Max Perlman struck out six batters in 6.2 innings, Harvard was unable to recover to win the early matchup.
BROWN 2, HARVARD 0
Brown came out strong to start the four-game series. After holding the Crimson scoreless in the top of the first inning, Brown scored the game’s winning run in the bottom of the same frame.
After an assurance tally in the fourth, Brown relied on a three-hit shutout by Matt Kimball to secure the victory, as the Crimson was unable to capitalize on many opportunities on the day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Perfect” is the word that best describes the weekend of the Harvard women’s softball team (26-13, 10-2 Ivy), which devastated Brown (10-16-1, 5-7 Ivy), 8-0, 9-0, 7-3, and 11-1, respectively, in four games on Saturday and Sunday.
“Everything came together this weekend,” sophomore Stephanie Regan said. “Our pitchers were awesome; our offense was awesome ... it’s Harvard softball the way we want to play it.”
HARVARD 11, BROWN 1
In the final game of the weekend, it took four innings for Harvard to get going—but once the bats began connecting, they never stopped.
Regan got the ball rolling, slamming a hit to left field for a single, and she was followed by freshman Kasey Lange, who sent her to third base off of a double.
Once Regan was in scoring position, junior Whitney Shaw sealed the deal with an RBI bunt, bringing Regan in and gaining first base. Immediately after, Lange and Shaw were brought home off of a homer from another freshman, Allison Scott.
“It took us a while to put the hits together and get runners into position, but once we did, we didn’t slow down,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “[The players] put everything they could into the game ... and really came to play.”
The Bears struck back in the bottom of the fourth, with Kat Strobel logging a single home run to put her team on the board. The homer would be the only tally of the game for Brown, which ended the weekend with a meager four runs, compared to the Crimson’s total of 35.
Harvard went on to score seven more runs in the game, with Scott recording her second home run of the game and Shaw also drilling a solo home run in the top of the sixth and a two-run homer in the top of the seventh. Freshman Laura Ricciardone recorded the win.
HARVARD 7, BROWN 3
In the most competitive game of the series, the Crimson came off of a strong Saturday showing to face both the exhaustion of a doubleheader and the determination of the resilient Bears.
“Game three was hard,” Allard said. “We were fatigued after playing so hard yesterday ... but we finally came together.”
Co-captain Ellen Macadam started Harvard off in the top of the third inning, capitalizing on a bunt to take first base. She then stole second and was driven to third off a sacrifice bunt by Regan.
But Lange ultimately brought Macadam home off of a fly-out to center field. Regan, Macadam, and Lange collaborated again in the top of the fifth to garner two more runs for the Crimson, which had allowed a Brown home run in the previous inning.
After Macadam singled to reach first base, with teammate freshman Shelbi Olson in scoring position at third, Regan again offered a sacrifice RBI bunt that drove Olson home and Macadam to second. Lange then followed with a single up the middle to bring in Macadam.
The powerful trio struck yet again in the top of the sixth to earn three more runs, bringing the score to 6-1, along with contributions from sophomore Ashley Heritage and junior Mari Zumbro.
The final run for Harvard came off of a solo home run from Scott, and junior pitcher Rachel Brown was able to clinch the win.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
It took no time for the Crimson to reach the scoreboard in Saturday’s second game, with Regan giving Harvard a 1-0 cushion in the first inning after she came home on an RBI from Lange.
Macadam rose to the occasion in the third inning, knocking the ball to center for a triple and taking home after a ball slipped past the catcher.
Lange again brought Regan in off of a slap hit, earning another RBI. Shaw brought the lead to 4-0 after she took first on a fielder’s choice, was driven to third off of a double from Scott, and came home after an illegal pitch by a Brown hurler.
The Crimson earned five more runs in the game, while Ricciardone took care of business at the mound, allowing only four hits in the shutout—the first time Harvard has blanked its opponent in consecutive games since the 2009 season.
“The shutouts were huge,” Regan said. “It set the tone for the whole weekend that we were just going to dominate.”
HARVARD 8, BROWN 0
In the opening game of the weekend, the Crimson left no doubt that it came to win. Although it took a few innings for Harvard’s offense to get fired up, it took control in the third inning, recording seven runs in the frame, and never backed down afterwards.
Solid hitting, accompanied by an outstanding pitching performance from Rachel Brown, gave the Crimson its first win of the series.
Brown allowed only one hit in the game, while earning 11 strikeouts, bringing her to her 15th win and fifth shutout of the season. Lange, Shaw, Scott, Heritage, and Zumbro all contributed to an unstoppable lineup.
“One of our biggest goals of the series was to get all three aspects of our game firing at the same time—pitching delivered shutouts, defense backed up the pitching, and our offense stepped up,” Shaw said. “This weekend really redefined what our swagger is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Make it happen.
For those looking to describe Harvard crew on Saturday, those three words are a good place to start.
“That’s been our motto all year,” said junior Mike DiSanto, seven seat of the heavyweight first varsity eight. “And we certainly made it happen today.”
The Crimson heavyweights swept its races against Princeton at Lake Carnegie in Princeton Township, N.J., while the lightweights took four out of five races on the Charles.
No. 3 HEAVYWEIGHTS vs. No. 4 PRINCETON
Last year, Harvard’s first varsity eight cruised to an easy victory after the Tigers lost the bow of their boat, but this year, Princeton didn’t give the Crimson anything.
Harvard had to take it.
“It was a bit like a boxing match,” DiSanto said. “We were both throwing punches. We kind of had the knockout punch with the sprint.”
The Tigers and the Crimson had been even throughout the race, but Princeton took two moves in the middle 1,000 that gave it an edge.
“They had two big pushes: one in the second 500 and one in the third 500,” junior stroke Pat Lapage said. “[Harvard coach] Harry [Parker] told us to expect that they’d be very strong through the middle. We sort of planned our race accordingly.”
According to DiSanto, the Tigers’ move at the 750-to-go mark gave it a lead of two-to-three seats that the crew would be able to hold until around 300 meters, when Harvard charged forward for good with a crushingly high sprint.
“We really brought it up,” DiSanto said of the stroke rating. “I think we probably went up to about 38-39 from about 750, up to 40 for the last 300, about 42 for the last 20 strokes.”
The sprint gave the Crimson a 1.2 second victory. It was the first time a Princeton first varsity eight had lost all season.
“We knew we had a pretty good sprint,” Lapage said. “It showed us how [fast] we have to be...We were pretty happy with the way it all panned out in the end.”
While the first varsity eight was a stroke-for-stroke battle, the other three races were more one-sided. The second varsity won by 10 seconds, the freshman eight won by 5.8 seconds, and the third varsity eight won by 15.3 seconds. Harvard’s fourth varsity eight, competing in the third varsity eight event, defeated the Tigers’ third varsity eight by 4.1 seconds and fell to its own 3V by 11.2 seconds.
“It’s becoming a nice trend,” Lapage said of his team’s depth. “It just means that no one’s taking his seat for granted. You have to focus on keeping your seat. Otherwise, there are guys ready and willing to take it. It’s a really healthy squad dynamic.”
The wins kept all five Crimson eights undefeated.
“It was a great bus ride home,” DiSanto said.
No. 2 LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. No. 8 DARTMOUTH, No. 14 MIT
In its first two weekends of racing, Harvard showed off its speed and its depth. On Saturday, in a severe tailwind and a Charles River basin brimming with whitecaps, the Crimson showed something else: its guts.
“The conditions were pretty wet and floppy,” said captain Will Newell, six seat of the first varsity eight. “A lot of the race was about maintaining and trying not to catch a crab...We decided that we were going to do our best, stay relaxed, try to have fun. It was fine; it wasn’t the prettiest rowing but it wasn’t going to be. You do what you can.”
According to Newell, Harvard and the Big Green stayed even for the first 500 meters, but Dartmouth took a few moves in the middle 1,000 that gave it a lead of around two seats just before the last 500.
“I think from 50 meters before to 50 meters after [the 1,500 meter mark] we went from being two seats down to being five or six seats up,” Newell said.
The Crimson was able to maintain its lead for a 1.9 second victory. MIT finished third.
The second varsity eight had a similarly tight race. The Crimson finished with a margin of 2.8 seconds.
“It was really nice to get some close competition, especially against Dartmouth,” Newell said. “For the 1V and the 2V, that was the closest margins we’ve had.”
The third varsity eight race differed sharply from the 1V and 2V events; Harvard won by 12.5 seconds.
“The 3V did a good job of dominating their race,” Newell said.
The freshman eight continued its upward trend with its second win of the season. There was overlap between the Crimson and the Big Green for the first 1,900 meters of the race, but a Dartmouth boat-stopping crab with 100 meters to go allowed Harvard to win by 6.8 seconds. The Engineers were third.
“The water was almost unrowable,” Muri said of the crab. “It was just challenging for everyone out there.”
For the 1F, which was in position to win before the crab, the victory showed significant progress.
“They’re definitely making improvements,” Muri said. “It’s very exciting.”
The only Crimson loss came in the second freshman event. Harvard’s 2F finished third in what was a tight race between all three crews. The Crimson finished 1.4 seconds behind the Big Green and .5 seconds behind Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of the time in college, ping-pong balls aren’t used for ping pong.
But the members of the Harvard Table Tennis Club have traded in solo cups for paddles and legitimate athletic competition.
Two Crimson teams competed in the national championships this past weekend in Rochester, Minn. The women qualified in February, and the co-ed made it in about a month later.
The event, sponsored by the National Collegiate Table Tennis Association, began last Thursday and ran through yesterday afternoon. The Gopher State hosted 31 teams—24 in the co-ed division and 14 in the women’s division, with some schools sending a constituent to both.
Neither team made a serious run at the national title.The women’s team finished 11th, and the co-ed squad, which qualified for the first time in five years, came in 20th.
At the individual level, Harvard had some success. Freshman Siddarth Viswanathan, the team’s only competitor in the men’s singles championship, made it to the second round before Lindenwood’s Paulo Rocha knocked him out.
Sophomore Nancy Chen made it as far in the women’s bracket before losing to Shu Hazinski of Texas Wesleyan, the eventual national champion.
In men’s doubles and mixed doubles, Harvard teams could not make it out of the first round.
The powerhouses of the collegiate table tennis world? Texas Wesleyan and Lindenwood, who finished first and second, respectively, in both the co-ed and women’s divisions.

The end of spring semester is just a few weeks away, which means that the class of 2011 is about to make the transition from Harvard students to Harvard alums. As such, seniors are encouraged to give back to the Harvard community with Senior Gift.
 
Residents from Eliot House have produced videos encouraging seniors to give back. They feature the most interesting man and woman in direct parodies of the Dos Equis commercials. Despite full schedules including advising Arnold Schwarzenegger on his accent and making togas for the Harvard Hoochies, these interesting people have found time to give back. Of course when they do give back, it's to Senior Gift.

During the late 19th century, Harvard put out advertisements encouraging prospective students to apply up until the very last days of summer. In an 1870 New York Times advertisement, the University boasted that 185 of the 210 candidates who took the entrance exam at the June examination were ultimately accepted. That's enough to get any Tiger Mom drooling.
These statistics are skewed by academic requirements, however, as applicants had to be versed in subjects that included (but were not limited to) Greek and Latin, ancient and modern geography, history, and math. During a time in which only two percent of people graduated from high school, it would make sense that Harvard would need to go on a search to find qualified applicants.
Nonetheless, some of America's top institutions would essentially bribe students to apply. Vassar attempted to entice applicants with the promise of excellent accommodations, including some of the finest rooms that professors' houses had to offer. Meanwhile, Yale Law School offered students free library access, prolonged fall, spring, and Christmas breaks, and the ability for students to come and go as they pleased.
During a time in which only 6.2 percent of applicants are being accepted to Harvard, it seems quite tempting to revert back to the ways of the past.
