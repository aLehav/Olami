After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Residents of the state of Oklahoma recently passed an amendment that bars Oklahoma judges from considering international laws—and specifically Islamic Sharia law—in formulating rulings. The amendment passed with 70 percent of the vote, but a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the amendment after a citizen of Oklahoma came forth, claiming that the Islam was specifically targeted by the amendment and that the law is thus deplorable. We agree with the citizen’s complaint: The amendment should indeed be overturned, as it explicitly and unnecessarily targets a religion and institutionalizes bias against Islam.
Despite the fact that the amendment was passed in a Bible Belt state in which the majority of the population practices Christianity, the amendment makes no specific mentions of canonic law or Talmudic law. Singling out a minority religion, as the amendment does, is inappropriate and adds nothing to the amendment itself. The amendment should have just commented on “international law” and left out any particular mention of Sharia law; the broader, former term encompasses the latter. Moreover, cases for using Sharia law in a court of law are not rampant enough throughout society to merit specific mention. Although Sharia law is relevant to a subset of the population, it is not the norm through the U.S. population and needs no particular attention when creating an amendment about international law. As written, the choice in the wording of the amendment plausibly reflects an intolerable prejudice against Islam as a religion.
Some proponents of the amendment claim that America is on a slippery slope toward recognizing Sharia law, often citing an incident in New Jersey in 2009 in which a judge refused to issue a restraining order against a man who forced sex on his unwilling wife. The man’s argument was based on a Sharia law, and the judge foolishly found the defendant’s actions permissible because they were in line with the man’s religious practices. In this case, however, the ruling was promptly overturned by an appeals court. Unsurprisingly, American legal code took precedence—and there is no reason to believe that an amendment is necessary to ensure such a hierarchy between American laws and foreign laws holds in the future. There are checks in place to make sure that U.S. law is the standard for decisions in our nation.
It is true that several states have laws that bar judges from taking into account foreign legal materials. Still, these laws may discriminate against outsiders of the United States, but they fall short of singling out a specific religious group. In contrast, the Oklahoma law unnecessarily targets Islam and, for that reason, must be overturned. We commend Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange for using her powers to restrain this stigmatizing piece of legislation.

Oklahoma’s recent amendment on Sharia law was a badly worded attempt to champion the independence of America’s legal system. Still the amendment, which prohibits state courts from considering Islamic and international law in deciding cases, should not simply be dismissed as irrelevant or bigoted. Although Sharia is not a threat to our way of life or our legal code, the integration of this system of law into the American one is a relevant issue that should receive more enough attention.
Islam has a legal framework, which covers everything from diet to crime to interest rates, which can be enforced in voluntary tribunal courts; this makes a discussion on Sharia law especially important. The vast majority of Jews do not go to an orthodox, rabbinical court and the vast majority of Catholics do not go to a papal court; however, an example of the influence of Islamic law is that in Britain, polls have shown that 40 percent of Muslims would like to see Sharia law introduced into the British legal code.
Indeed, in the U.S., courts can refer to decisions made by these voluntary religious courts and incorporate religious law. In a conflict of laws, American law wins, but this is where issues of consent and the fundamental values of these courts become important. The prospect of more and more legal cases in America being influenced, as they are allowed to, by Sharia law might threaten our social fabric—assuming that we value the concept of achieving a fully cohesive society. America, and Anglo-Saxon culture in general, has traditionally not frowned on multiculturalism and the existence of parallel communities as much as has Continental Europe. Even so, traditional aspects of Sharia law stand out in the scale of their difference from the legal practices and codes of much of the rest of the country.
Some aspects of the Sharia should be easy to accommodate into American culture: For example, many American banks are devising interest-free loans and products in accordance with the code so that they can operate more successfully in the Middle East. However, it is troubling that traditional interpretations of Sharia law do not consider a woman’s rights as equal to a man’s. The risk, then, is that decisions made by voluntary tribunal Islamic courts would strongly clash with those made by American courts. Traditional Sharia law includes provisions such as that a woman’s testimony is worth less than a man’s, and its application led to the stoning of Sakine Mohammadi-Ashtiani for adultery in Iran. In practice, it is naïve to think that a women from a traditional Islamic family would have the same power over deciding a marital problem as would, say, a non-religious woman of European descent. For precisely this kind of reason, The British human rights organization One Law For All, founded by a group of female Iranian refugees, campaigns for a ban on all Sharia courts in the U.K.
One might argue that the Bible, the Talmud and other religious texts also can lead to non-progressive conclusions, but the difference is that their scale is not the same. In Britain, Muslim Arbitration Tribunals are legally recognized and their decisions can be enforced by the public court system. Many Sharia courts have already sprung up and are deciding civil issues across the country. Informal tribunals are also able to issue non-binding decrees equivalent to mediation. Feedback in Britain shows that such traditional bodies do not necessarily always stick to their remit. For this reason, concerns over Sharia Law should be extended to the increase in private Sharia tribunals, which are permitted to decide voluntary civil—not criminal—cases in America.
We can take something from the statement reflected by the Oklahoma’s legislature. It’s not good to simply dismiss Sharia law as a threat to social cohesion; the question is whether or not many aspects of Sharia work against our efforts to build more a more progressive society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stem cell research is among the most critical pursuits of our time. Medical discoveries occur on many levels, but stem cells might very well be capable of fundamentally changing the way diseases are treated. It is therefore critical that the decision made by federal judge Royce C. Lamberth in August, which could stifle progress in this essential realm of study, must not stand.
The decision comes as a response to President Barack H. Obama’s 2009 executive order to reduce limitations on research, which were imposed by President George W. Bush. The controversy originates from the 1996 Dickey-Wicker amendment, a key piece of stem cell legislation that prevents tax-dollar funding of the creation, destruction, or injury of human embryos. While this ruling has been renewed annually, both Obama and Bush permitted funding for other phases of the stem cell research process, even those that used cells obtained from such embryos.
The scientists who started the lawsuit against Obama’s order claim that this distinction is a false one. Their point is valid—if the government doesn’t fund the initial processes conducted on embryos but supports the subsequent research on their cells, then it is primarily making a symbolic gesture by withholding that funding.
Frankly, this stance sends a mixed message to Americans about the government’s position on the issue. Obviously, there are sharp disagreements among our leaders as to the ethics of stem cell research, but the majority opinion ought to assume a firmer position one way or the other. Other countries already have laws in place with far less ambiguity.
Having said that, the legal vagueness exposed by this case should be remedied by movement away from such restrictions. The consequences of limiting this funding are several. First and perhaps most important is the simple disruption of hard-won progress that took many years to achieve. Douglas Melton and David Scadden of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute cite the court’s decision as “disastrous for our science.”
It isn’t only the research and the medical and scientific progress that could be affected. Melton and Scadden add that such action will discourage others from pursuing careers in the field. Furthermore, around 1,300 jobs could be at stake, along with $200 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health. Scientists are turning to private sources of funding out of fear of the effects of Lamberth’s decision.
It is not as though stem cells only provide hope or the theoretical promise of advancements. Progress in the field is very real, and the case comes at a time of high momentum for some researchers. Recently, a Harvard team discovered a new method of obtaining stem cells that does not require the destruction of embryos. A group at Stanford also found that skin cells could possibly be turned into stem cells. Additionally, doctors recently began trials on U.S. spinal cord patients using tissues created from stem cells.
These are signs of progress, and if Lamberth’s ruling holds, then a great deal of momentum could be lost. Some researchers will be stalled while they search for alternative sources of funding, and others will have no choice but to discontinue their work altogether. This potentially means throwing away gains made through the use of embryos and rendering their destruction meaningless, which should bring no comfort even to opponents of stem cell research.
The potential of stem cells is widely recognized, and that fact will motivate some scientists to research them so long as they can manage to find funding. Imposing limitations on federal contributions will cause great disruption but will not stop research in its entirely; Harvard’s work, for instance, would be unaffected. What it will do is slow progress down, and crucial discoveries, perhaps including those that could eliminate the need to use embryos altogether, will not come as quickly.
Lamberth’s decision is crushing not only for scientists but also for the many individuals whose sole hopes lie in potential stem cell cures. The wheels are in motion for epochal advancements in medical science; now is not the time to discourage our nation’s hardworking researchers. The ruling is a slam to scientific inquiry at large. Science relies heavily on continuous progress; if there is a persistent fear that projects will be disrupted, then motivation will surely vanish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the waning days of the Democratic House majority, Congress has at least one major question to resolve—whether to extend the Bush tax cuts. While the Obama administration and most Democrats agree that the cuts for low and middle-income taxpayers should be made permanent, they would allow those for high-income households to expire, increasing the top two income tax rates and the capital gains rate. They claim a tax hike is needed to reduce the deficit, but allowing these tax cuts to expire would not solve the long-term deficit problem and could even make it worse.
The GOP’s defense of the tax cuts is largely premised on the argument that, in the words of Rep. Paul D. Ryan, Jr., “You don’t raise taxes during a recession.” While some have argued that the money that would be “spent” on the rich should instead be used for a payroll tax holiday or a rebate for all citizens, tax cuts tend to be most effective when they alter incentives, and the best way to do that is by permanently reducing rates. Increasing tax rates would discourage the investment needed to create new jobs just at the moment it is most needed.
Even some Democrats might agree that taxes should not be raised during a recession, but to say that they should be made permanent may appear tenuous given the budget deficits projected in the future. Claims that the tax increase would generate $678 billion over ten years are likely overstated given its effect on incentives, but allowing these cuts to expire—despite the rhetoric of some Republicans—would lead to an increase in revenues that would reduce the level of the deficit in the coming years.
Raising taxes, however, is not the solution to the budget crisis; to determine the appropriate solution, it is necessary to understand the nature of the crisis itself. For one thing, the fiscal year 2010 deficit of $1.6 trillion is largely due to mammoth stimulus spending and a temporary decline in revenues because of the recession. The deficit in 2007 was just $161 billion, and that year saw the beginning of the Iraq troop surge.
The greatest cause for concern is not the current level of the deficit but its unsustainable rate of growth in the long run, which is due to ballooning entitlement obligations. Thanks largely to medical technology and the aging population, the Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will grow from about 10 percent of GDP today to about 16 percent by 2035, causing the public debt to mushroom from 53 to 200 percent of GDP.
Unless the American public is willing to stomach a tax increase worth six percent of GDP between now and 2035—and even more after that—Congress should set a fixed level of taxation, such as the one we have now, and reform entitlement programs to bring the budget into long-term balance. For those who are concerned about distributional consequences, a first step might be to reduce or cancel Social Security and Medicare benefits for the wealthy.
From a political standpoint, the proposed tax increase could actually worsen long-term budgetary prospects because of how it would impact the composition of federal revenues. According to the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, about 47 percent of Americans paid no federal income taxes at all in 2009—either their incomes were too low, or they qualified for enough credits, deductions, and exemptions to eliminate their liability. The bottom 40 percent, on average, made a profit from the income tax, meaning they got more money in tax credits than they would otherwise have owed in taxes. Instead of a bill, the government sent them a check.
These citizens might pay excise taxes, but these only amount to three percent of total revenue, and are often levied on recreational goods. While all working citizens must pay taxes for Social Security and Medicare, they directly benefit from these programs when they retire.
What this means is that 47 percent of the country has virtually no stake in funding the military, benefits for veterans and federal retirees, federal support for education, infrastructure, and numerous other aspects of federal spending not directly tied to workers’ retirement welfare. And they have little stake in Medicare outpatient and prescription drug services, which are funded predominantly by general revenues. The top 10 percent of earners, by contrast, contributed about 73 percent of income taxes in 2009, which is to say nothing of the effects of corporate and estate taxes paid disproportionately by the rich.
The wealthy are certainly not oppressed by the tax code or any other aspect of government. But an analysis of the causes of the budget crisis should account for the fact that the federal government is all benefit and no cost for nearly half the population, and very little cost for many others. When elected representatives must answer to these citizens as well as those footing the bill, is it any wonder they have been so fiscally irresponsible?
Raising taxes on upper-income citizens would only exacerbate this problem by increasing the share of federal revenues contributed by the few at the top. If Congress wants to raise taxes, it should raise them for everyone so that more citizens have at least some stake in paying for their government. Without entitlement reform, this will be not a suggestion but a necessity.

Nowadays it’s impossible to walk past the Science Center without getting ambushed by representatives from an a cappella group or dance team, but it wasn’t always so. Before the 18th century, Harvard had no clubs at all. Only by the 1720s a slew of organizations with long, unpronounceable names began to add color, and a distinct student voice, to the Puritan campus.
The earliest clubs were spaces for discussion. The Philomusarian, founded in 1728, forbade members from ‘scoffing’ at one another’s opinions during weekly debates. The Spy Club started in 1721, had nothing to do with spying and was formed by editors of The Telltale, an eclectic student ‘newspaper’ with the distinction of being the oldest college publication.
While The Telltale was initially modeled after publications of the day, it dissolved into an outlet for more personal stories, and discussions, such as one lengthy account of an editor’s dream. After the paper lost steam, the members re-formed into the Spy Club, where they happily debated issues such as whether premarital relations were really immoral.
Twenty years later, the Latin Society was formed, followed by the Martimercurian Band (yet another debate club). The Speaking Club came together in 1770 within the generation that would put the debate skills they had cultivated to use in supporting or opposing the American Revolution. After this point, clubs focused less exclusively on debate. These were the days of the Porcellian (1791), Phi Beta Kappa (1790), and a small, secret club where members held mock trials for professors and historical figures over bowls of pudding, which would one day evolve into the world-famous and well-funded drag show extraordinaire, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals (1795).
By the 19th century, a greater diversity of groups sprang up across campus, from the Glee Club (1858) and Art Club (1873) to slightly more unique organizations such as the Free Wool Club (1889) and Total Abstinence League (1888). From there it was only a hop, skip, and a jump away from such modern wonders as H-Bomb and the (Rubik’s) Cube Club.

Kneeling down next to three-year-old Sabine Armstrong, Svilen N. Kanev ’12 helped the young Cambridge resident use a video game controller to maneuver a robot at the Harvard Allston Education Portal’s Science Jamboree on Saturday. The Jamboree was organized by the Life Sciences Department, Ed Portal staff, and the Science Cabinet, a coalition of 23 science, mathematics and health-related undergraduate organizations formed this past summer. The event at the Ed Portal, a community outreach facility, aimed to encourage local children’s interest in science. The young students visited nine different science exhibitions—which ranged from making ice cream using dry ice to dissecting owl pellets—receiving a stamp on their “science passports” as they progressed.  “Look at how excited [the children] are,” said Susan Johnson, one of the Life Science Department’s outreach coordinators, gesturing to the crowd of rambunctious children scurrying from demonstration to demonstration. “I remember when I was young I  fell in love with science when I looked through a microscope at an organism at an event like this. I want these children to have the same opportunity to do that.” Both Harvard students and community parents said that the event, the first showcase held by undergraduate students at the Ed Portal, not only exposed neighborhood children to science but also brought Harvard undergraduates and community residents together. “This Jamboree helps give Harvard a face,” said Johnny H.  Hu ’11, a math and science mentor at the Ed Portal. “Students can interact with residents, and we [students] can have a positive impact on the community.” The Ed Portal, located at 175 North Harvard Street, opened in July 2008 as a component of the $25 million community benefits package that Harvard agreed to in order to build the $1 billion Allston Science Complex. Construction on the Science Complex  was halted in Dec. 2009 due to financial constraints. The Jamboree drew approximately 100 community parents and students, according to Ed Portal Director Mary Helen Black. Black, an Allston resident herself, noted that Portal regulars as well as “many new faces” attended the event. “I’m glad that Harvard has resources like this for the community,” said Allston-Brighton resident Jim McLoughlin, who brought his three young children to the Jamboree. “This is a fabulous chance for my kids to learn.” —Staff writer Tara W.

Sociology Professor Peter V. Marsden will take over as the divisional dean of the social sciences effective Jan. 1, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced in an e-mail sent to faculty members yesterday afternoon.
Marsden is the former chair of the sociology department, and his main  areas of research are social networks and organizations. He will succeed current Divisional Dean Stephen M. Kosslyn, who accepted a position at Stanford University over the summer to lead its behavioral science center.
“I am deeply grateful to Professor Marsden for agreeing to serve in this role,” Smith wrote in the e-mail.
Marsden, expressing anticipation for his tenure as dean, said he hopes to acquaint himself with the budget cutting issues that have consumed Kosslyn’s time as divisional dean.
He wrote that while he did not yet feel fully informed about the financial situation, “the division will certainly seek to use the resources we have wisely, while identifying opportunities for additional revenue streams as they present themselves.”
Since his appointment in 2008 as divisional dean for social science, Kosslyn established a Social Science Working Group, which was originally charged with the task of budget cutting but later expanded to seek alternative revenue sources.
As FAS now enters a period when endowment payout is increasing, budgetary pressure has been lifted slightly.
Marsden’s colleagues from the sociology department said that they believed he would flourish in his new role, especially given the greater financial flexibility.
Social Sciences Professor Lawrence D. Bobo, who has known Marsden as a colleague and friend for 15 years, wrote in an e-mail that he believed Marsden to be “an aboslutely dynamite choice” for the position.
“I cannot envision anyone who could bring to this position better judgment, a greater breadth of experience, or a deeper commitment to excellence in scholarship and teaching than Peter Marsden,” Bobo wrote.
In particular, Sociology Lecturer David L. Ager said that Marsden’s initiatives to “include diverse opinions” would make him a “truly great dean.”
“He is truly very respected within the department and within the social sciences,” Ager said.
According to Sociology Professor Michele Lamont, Marsden will be aware of the significant “unmet needs” of qualitative social scientists.
“He gets things done. He is a skilled administrator and tireless good citizen of this University. He listens carefully to what others say, want, and need,” Bobo added.

Amid snowballing regulatory scrutiny, the makers of the popular caffeinated alcoholic drink Four Loko announced yesterday that they would no longer include caffeine, guarana, and taurine in their beverages.
Phusion Projects—whose drink has received criticism from government regulators, as well as Harvard College and University Health Services administrators—said that it would reformulate the beverage to remove stimulants like caffeine.
“We are taking this step after trying—unsuccessfully—to navigate a difficult and politically-charged regulatory environment at both the state and federal levels,” the managing partners of Phusion Projects said in a statement.
The announcement came after a flurry of actions against the company early this week. Yesterday, the Massachusetts Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission announced increased restrictions on the sale of such beverages. The new measures are slated to be filed next Monday.
In a press release, the Commission said that the classification of Four Loko as a malt beverage “may be misleading consumers about the true contents of the products being sold.”
Following the announcement in Mass., Senator Charles E. Schumer ’71 said that the Food and Drug Administration was expected to effectively ban the sale of caffeinated alcoholic beverages, including Four Loko, as early as next week.
The federal ruling would designate caffeine to be an unsafe additive to beverages with alcohol, making the sale and marketing of such drinks illegal.
“This ruling should be the nail in the coffin of these dangerous and toxic drinks,” Schumer said in a statement. “Parents should be able to rest a little easier knowing that soon their children won’t have access to this deadly brew.”
Harvard College administrators have taken a strong stand against the beverage, which they say is dangerous due to its potent mix of stimulants and depressants.
In an e-mail last month, University Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59 and Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Director Ryan M. Travia warned students not to drink Four Loko, the consumption of which they said had caused some Harvard students to require medical treatment.
Yesterday, before Phusion Projects announced its change in formulation, Travia wrote in an e-mail statement sent by a spokeswoman that AODS was “concerned about Four Loko and has worked to raise awareness among students about the risks associated with its consumption.”
“Our hope is that any action taken regarding Four Loko will serve to increase awareness of these issues and limit dangerous consumption on campus,” he wrote.
Prior to the announcement by Phusion Projects, employees at liquor stores in Harvard Square said that the loss of Four Loko due to a ban would probably not affect overall sales significantly.
George Sarkis, manager of C’est Bon Convenience in Harvard Square, said he did not anticipate the ban on Four Loko would affect his business “at all.”
“Three months ago there was no Four Loko here,” he said, standing next to a shelf full of the colorful cans. “With it or without it, we’ll be fine.”

The College Events Board will be hosting its first themed Harvard-Yale pep rally—Light Up the Yard—on Thursday, bringing student performances, free food, and Harvard spirit to the Old Yard.
The CEB’s fifth annual pep rally will take place in front of the John Harvard statue from 8:15 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. and will feature the Harvard University Band, the Harvard Glee Club, stand-up comedy performed by Peter D. Davis ’12, Harvard Expressions Dance Company, an inter-House hot-dog eating competition, a Poi performance by a student, Harvard University Cheerleading, the Harvard University Football team, and the student band Third Rail, in that order.
Davis, who is currently running for Undergraduate Council vice president, will also emcee the festivities.
In accordance with the pep rally’s theme, the CEB will be decorating the Yard with lights and giving out a limited number of glow-in-the-dark shutter shades to students. Free hot chocolate, cider, donuts, and chowder will also be available.
For freshmen, the First Year Social Committee will also be hosting a pre-pep rally behind Stoughton and Hollis Halls at 8 p.m.
The FYSC will offer free face paint and an opportunity for freshmen to gather before running into the Old Yard as a class, according to the event’s Freshman Publicity Chair Jillian M. Smith ’14.
After the 2008 pep rally featuring DJ Girl Talk was cut short due to problems with the stage setup and crowd control, the CEB revamped the event to revolve around student performances and “to show how great Harvard is and what we have to offer here,” said CEB Chair Moira E. Forberg ’11.
While the format of Thursday’s pep rally will be similar to that of last year’s, Forberg said the addition of Third Rail to the line-up should make it “more of a high-energy event.”
“We’re trying to get the best of all worlds,” Forberg added. “We want to combine high energy student performances with a dance party.”
With the additions to this year’s line-up and free goodies for attendees, the CEB expects a high turnout on Thursday night, according to Forberg.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 18, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 17 news article "Pep Rally To Offer Shutter Shades, Performances" incorrectly reported that the Harvard-Yale pep rally will feature a glowstick performance by Poi. In fact, the event will feature a Poi performance by a student.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Computer Science professor Matthew D. Welsh, who was tenured this past summer, announced on Monday that he will be resigning from Harvard.
Currently on sabbatical at Google, Welsh wrote on his blog that his decision to leave was informed mainly by a change in “priorities in life,” and that he is now enjoying working on what he feels are larger problems than what he faced as a professor.
“In many ways, working at Google is realizing the dream I’ve had of building big systems my entire career,” he said on his blog.
Welsh wrote in his post that in computer science academia “the very best possible outcome for your research is that someone at Google or Microsoft or Facebook reads one of your papers, gets inspired by it, and implements something like it internally.”
Welsh added, “At Google, I have a much more direct route from idea to execution to impact.”
Welsh had blogged this past May on his uncertainty about being a professor, writing that despite the benefits of working with the “next generation,” overlooked drawbacks—such as constantly finding funding for research, a consistent flow of work, and an incessant stream of faculty meetings—proved to be unattractive elements of the job.
“[Being a professor] is certainly not for everybody,” Welsh wrote in May. “It remains to be seen if it is even for me.”
Welsh refused to comment further.
Computer Science Area Dean Michael D. Mitzenmacher said he disagreed with Welsh’s perspective of academia, though he wished Welsh all the best.
“I don’t think that’s how I feel about my work, and I don’t think that’s how other professors feel either,” Mitzenmacher said.
In a guest post on Welsh’s blog, Mitzenmacher outlined the many reasons why he enjoys being a professor, listing professional freedom, intellectual exposure, and challenging opportunities.
Harvard students lamented Welsh’s departure, saying that his dynamism in the classroom energized many to continue to pursue Computer Science.
“He made the class interesting, engaging,” said Austin P. Donisan ’11, who was a student in Welsh’s Computer Science 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization.”
“His departure will certainly be a loss.”
Stefan K. Muller ’12, who also took Welsh’s class on systems, agreed that Welsh brought great energy and wit to his lectures.
“He’s definitely one of the most engaging professors that I’ve had at Harvard, and it’s a shame to see him not use that in the future,” Muller said. “Selfishly, I really am sorry to see him go from the CS faculty. There’s a wry sense of humor that he brings, and that’s lost in a lot of other classes.”

The Yale College Council will host one school-wide tailgate for Bulldogs on Saturday in response to problems experienced with Yale’s multiple tailgates the last time the Game was played at Harvard in 2008.
Previously, most of Yale’s residential colleges had their own tailgates. This year, the tailgate has been centralized to involve all but two of the residential colleges, Davenport and Timothy Dwight, according to Courtney B. Pannell, a Yale senior and associate member of the YCC who is helping to organize the tailgate.
The consolidated tailgate comes as a result of confusion in 2008 when multiple entrances and miscommunication between the arriving U-Hauls and event security resulted in many of Yale’s residential colleges’ tailgates being dispersed around the stadium instead of at Yale’s designated spot, the Beren Tennis Courts.
“In the past, not all the tailgates were next to each other or even necessarily near each other,” said Michael Chao, a Yale senior who is also the events director of the Yale College Council.
Pannell said that this year the YCC is in close contact with the Harvard event staff. As in 2008, Yale’s designated location on Saturday will be the Beren Tennis Courts.
“This year there is a lot more communication and organization. There are a lot fewer voices they have to hear,” Pannell said. “The YCC is getting involved here as a service to the student body.”
Yale will be subject to the tailgate alcohol restrictions that were implemented at Harvard for the Game in 2008. Unlike when Yale hosts the annual match, Harvard tailgate rules forbid kegs and hard alcohol. The YCC will only be providing boxed wine and canned beer at their tailgate.
Also, as in 2008, tailgating at Harvard must end at noon, while rules at Yale allow tailgating until half-time. “We are under the same rules as the Harvard Houses with regards to drinking,” Pannell said.
According to Chao, most of the residential colleges could have feasibly financed their own tailgate, but organizing the various tailgates and bringing them to Harvard would be inconvenient.
“Without this one tailgate only three or four of the residential colleges would have had a tailgate,” Chao said.
Having one YCC tailgate ensures that the colleges do not have to bring their own grills and U-Hauls.
Harvard will provide food to all Harvard and Yale students, according to Chao. With grilled food taken care of, Yale was able to order a caterer for a variety of special treats.
“Harvard has been hugely cooperative,” Pannell said. “We really want to work together with Harvard to ensure that we comply with all the restrictions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court Margaret H. Marshall delivered a talk on judicial reform in the United States before a large audience in Memorial Church last night.
Marshall’s speech was part of the Paul Tillich Lecture Series, founded to commemorate the work of former Harvard professor and renowned theologian Paul J. Tillich.
Whereas many past lecturers in the series focused their talks primarily on Tillich’s religious views, Marshall connected Tillich’s work to her own field.
“It is [Tillich’s] passion for justice I invoke this evening, because this passion is also close to my heart,” she said.
Marshall highlighted the politicizing of state judiciaries as an area for reform.
She expressed dismay at the growing influence of donations by special interest groups in “multimillion-dollar scorched-earth campaigns” over the decisions made by judges.
“All judges must have the backbone to do what is right, according to the rule of law,” Marshall said.
She also pointed to the lack of funding for state courts as another significant barrier to court accessibility.
According to Marshall, the services of many courts are not readily accessible, especially to the handicapped and the increasing population of senior citizens.
She also praised Tillich’s “uncompromising resolve to see the world for what it is” and asked her audience to push for judicial reform.
Marshall ended her talk by asking the audience, “Will you act on the ideas embodied in the Constitution and teach them to others?” The query garnered  sustained applause and a standing ovation.
Tillich lecture series founder and curator William R. Crout said he chose Marshall as a speaker in the series following her recent retirement announcement.
Marshall, the first woman to hold the Massachusetts Chief Justice position, has served in the role since 1999.
“I thought it would be a wonderful thing for her to take part in the lectures. She immediately accepted,” Crout said.
Last night’s talk was the 37th lecture to take place in honor of Tillich.
Tillich, who was born in Prussia and educated in Berlin, was a strong opponent of Hitler and one of the first non-Jewish faculty to be dismissed from the University of Frankfurt in 1933.
Following his dismissal, Tillich immigrated to the United States and was appointed a University professor at Harvard in 1954, where he taught at the Harvard Divinity School.

University Council candidates focused on campus social space and personal security during a debate in Lowell Junior Common Room last night.
Both of the major tickets that participated—Matt S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Tengbo Li ’12, and Senan Ebrahim ’12 and Bonnie Cao ’12—emphasized the importance of expanding social spaces for student groups around Harvard.
Coe said the issue was “something I feel very strongly about,” pointing to student dissatisfaction with dining hall parties. He proposed greater use of under-utilized locations like junior common rooms and house grilles, as well as closer relationships with neighborhood businesses that can host student gatherings.
Ebrahim and Cao suggested extending a pilot program they had recently helped establish, which provides funding for student groups to rent on- and off-campus venues for social events.
Harvard Political Union Chair Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11, who moderated the debate, also brought up crime and the recent series of area muggings, asking the candidates, “What do you intend to do to ensure that students feel safe?”
Coe commended the freedom and trust afforded by Harvard’s current security measures, but advocated late-night ID checks at entrances to the Yard. Ebrahim, meanwhile, said that he and the rest of the UC were proposing more lighting, safer pedestrian routes, and increased bike patrols. “We want to work creatively with students,” he said.
The candidates answered Ramaswamy’s questions for about 20 minutes before the floor was opened to the audience.
Several questioners challenged the candidates on their intentions for UC accountability and on their ability to implement their campaign promises.
Coe and Li said that the short-term nature of their proposals would give the student body “tangible results.” Ebrahim and Cao said that more of their own proposals entailed working closely with University administrators. While those plans might take longer to implement, they said, it was more likely that they would “create a legacy” for future students.
Throughout the debate, the candidates commended their competitors, acknowledging shared goals and ideals. In closing the debate, Ramaswamy remarked that it had been “the most civil and friendly debate I have been to in four years.” Both tickets, he continued afterwards, “seemed like they would work well together.”
The third presidential ticket of Collin A. Jones ’12 and Peter D. Davis ’12 did not attend.

Generally, stars, planets, and particularly black holes are described in terms of billions of years, but researchers at NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory Center say they recently found a black hole formed only 30 years ago.
Astronomy Professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb, who co-authored the study, said in a press release that “this may be the first time the common way of making a black hole has been observed.”
The discovery may give scientists new insight into how black holes are made, under what conditions stars die, and why a dying star will sometimes create either a neutron star or a black hole.
It is a chance for scientists to support the long-standing theory that black holes are created by the collapse of large stars and the belief that they continue to be fed by residue from the explosion.
“How does a star end its life? This is a question often asked in Hollywood, but we’re dealing with real stars here,” Loeb said.
According to the release, the black hole is the youngest found in our “cosmic neighborhood”—likely formed after the death of a star 50 times the size of the sun.
The dying star first came to scientists’ attention when an amateur astronomer spotted it through a telescope in his backyard, according to press officer Megan M. Watzke. Since then, she said, scientists have been monitoring the star intermittently.
But with the launch of the Chandra Observatory in 1999, it became possible to study its X-ray emissions. To their surprise, researchers found that the X-rays did not subside, and the “blast waves did not move on,” as one would expect from a supernova.
They concluded that they were likely observing a black hole—and had stumbled upon the rare opportunity to witness it in the earliest years of its formation.
The next step, Watzke said, is a deeper investigation of the black hole, as there is still the possibility that what is being observed is actually a neutron star.
Watzke said a follow up study will ensue, which will include a more detailed reading of the data to get a “fingerprint of X-ray light.”

People who start smoking marijuana at a young age are more likely to perform poorly at cognitive tasks than those who start at a later age, according to a new study by Harvard-affiliated researchers.
The results, released Monday at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego, examined the effect of chronic marijuana use on brain function. Those who began using pot before the age of 16 had more trouble focusing, learning from mistakes, and thinking abstractly than those who began afterwards, the study found.
“The more and the earlier you smoke, the worse you perform on these tasks,” said lead author Medical School Assistant Professor Staci A. Gruber, who is director of the Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Core at McLean Hospital.
A total of 33 chronic marijuana smokers and 26 non-smoking control subjects participated in the study. They were asked to complete a series of tests involving “executive function,” a set of abilities that includes planning, abstract thinking, flexibility, and inhibiting inappropriate responses, according to Gruber.
The chronic smokers made repeated errors and showed an inability to maintain focus. The younger group of smokers made twice as many mistakes as the older group and gave fewer correct responses.
The study also revealed that early-onset users smoked three times the amount of marijuana in grams per week and twice as often than late-onset users.
“Marijuana works the same way as alcohol and nicotine,” Gruber said. “Exposure to marijuana prior to 16 will have significant negative results on development, leading to long-term negative ramifications.”
According to a 2009 study from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, nearly 16 percent of eighth graders have tried marijuana. The number rises to 42 percent by 12th grade.
Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor emeritus of psychiatry at the Medical School, expressed doubts about the study: “I’m a little suspicious because so much of it has been wrong in the past,” he said. “After it’s peer reviewed, then I will look at it again so I can be less skeptical.”
Grinspoon said he agrees with the  view that marijuana should be prohibited to young people, but for a different reason.
“We don’t want them smoking marijuana as much as we don’t want them to drink alcohol or use cocaine or ecstasy,” he said, “simply because I don’t think young people have the wisdom yet. I don’t think they are ready for this experience.”

Professors from the Harvard School of Public Health and Brown University released a study on Monday pointing to a “potential causal relationship” between smoking during pregnancy and criminal behavior among offspring later in life.
The authors—including  Angela D. Paradis of the Harvard School of Public Health and Stephen Buka, a professor of community health at Brown University—tracked over 4,000 pregnancies in Rhode Island between 1959 and 1966, collecting information on the mothers’ smoking habits.
In 1999 and 2000, the researchers checked the criminal records of 3766 of the now-adult children.
According to the study, “[t]he offspring of mothers who smoked heavily during pregnancy had a 47% increased odds of multiple versus no arrests.”
These findings highlight the costly impact of smoking while pregnant, Buka said.
“There seems to be consistent and somewhat surprising long-term effects on aggression, criminality and violence that we don’t fully understand but that seem real,” he added.
The study controlled for several other variables, such as income level and maternal IQ, and found that a strong association between smoking and crime remained.
However, Paradis said, smoking mothers “tend to be younger moms with less education from poor neighborhoods,” and so the problem disproportionately affects low-income groups.
The findings offer a glimpse of hope for future generations, Paradis said, adding that repeat-criminals are “very expensive to society,” and maternal smoking is “potentially modifiable.”
Other long-term studies are also examining which environmental factors predispose children to such behavior. The federal government is currently undertaking the largest to date—the National Children’s Study, which follows 100,000 children from their prenatal stage through their twenty-first birthday.
Researchers like Paradis and Buka hope that the discovery of factors that cause violent crime will lead to programs that are, as Paradis said, “sensitive to people most at risk.”

Conor White-Sullivan, a former student at UMass Amherst, won $500 yesterday from the fourth annual Elevator Pitch Competition for his website, localocracy.org, which provides a platform for registered voters to voice their opinions on town issues.
The event, sponsored by the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum, Harvard Student Agencies, and the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard, gave the 24 participants only 90 seconds to present their ideas to a panel. According to the organizers, this event tested a key skill in the business world: pitching ideas to an executive in the time of an elevator ride.
The panel included Bilal Zubari, who works for General Catalyst Partners, a Boston investment company, Woodward Yang, an electrical engineering and computer science professor, and Brent J. Hurley, YouTube founding member. They judged the participants based on the quality of the idea and delivery of the pitch itself.
Dan G. Sullivan ’11, co-president of the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum who moderated the event, said the purpose of the Elevator Pitch was to spread awareness of entrepreneurship opportunities. The Technology and Entrepreneurship Center funded the $1,000 in prize money.
Zubari said that, from an outside perspective, Harvard’s community seems disjointed: undergraduates and graduate students rarely collaborate on similar ideas. However, he said the situation is improving. “What Harvard is doing now,” Zubari said, “is more of a coordinated effort to bring people together to talk about innovation.”
This event is also a precursor to i3, the larger competition in March that awards a total of $50,000 to social or commercial startup companies, according to Alexander R. Gerson ’12, Harvard Student Agencies Director of the i3 Harvard Innovation Challenge.
“Especially at a place like Harvard,” Gerson said, “everyone has an idea. If we could just capitalize on that and incentivize people to pitch those ideas...there are some amazing ideas.”
Many of the startups yesterday involved social media, either for campus life, college counseling, or global health. The other finalists included an anti-corrosive agent, a texting service to remind mothers of critical pregnancy checkups in India, an aggregated news site for Hispanic Americans, and a digital pet for mobile devices.
While the event was geared toward undergraduates, Sullivan said pitching was open to anyone. It attracted an audience of over 60 people and ideas from all over campus, but in the end, the winner was unaffiliated with the university.
White-Sullivan said he originally came to campus with his friend Samuel B. Novey ’11 to recruit future employees from Harvard, but ended up pitching his company at the last minute. “Harvard has been very good to me this weekend,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems that some athletes are bred from birth for athletic competition; they practically pop out dribbling a basketball or swinging a bat. But there are others who can point to a defining moment or experience when they realized they wanted to be more than average.
For me, it is definitely the latter.
As a rower, finding a college that met my criteria for the highest standards of academics and athletics was a top priority. However, it didn’t start out that way.
It wasn’t until the summer between my sophomore and junior year of high school when I met Harvard men’s lightweight coaching legend, Charley Butt, that I tacked “top Division-I rowing program” onto my long list of requirements for my college of choice. Charley is the person I credit with sparking my desire to row in college, and it’s ironic that today, I interact with him and his lightweight squad on a fairly regular basis as the team’s beat writer.
But it was nothing more than chance that our paths crossed in the summer of 2005.
Back then, I was still adjusting to wearing spandex and thinking “legs, back, then arms” every time I took a stroke, when my parents took me down to the Charles River Rowing Camp (CRRC) in Cambridge.
After I had signed up to row at school that spring, my mother’s Blackberry fingers had been only a quick Google search away from finding me a summer rowing camp near home to attend. Little did my mother know that she was shipping me off to learn from some of the top rowing coaches in the country.
In the beginning, I was only vaguely aware that the docks on which I walked were hallowed grounds, and that the Charles River on which I rowed was spiritual water. But thanks to the creaky boathouse floorboards, the decades’ worth of team pictures adorning the walls, and the dusty silver plates and trophies scattered about, I could sense that the boathouse and river were part of an intimidating legacy.
I felt quite out of my league, since I had  only about six weeks of on-the-water time under my belt before arriving at camp. And, it is how I, then a 5’6” girl with no dreams of rowing glory, left camp thinking I could one day be a Division-I rower that is most interesting about my path to where I am today.
In short, it started with Charley.
Charley was my first coach at camp and, although he was part of an all-male coaching staff there, he was one of the most welcoming figures. Before the row, he’d gather us together and speak about what we’d be working on that day. He spoke calmly and slowly, almost as if he was reading a story to us. His directions were very precise, a result of years of experience.
And, once we were out on the water, he’d just let us row. His launch normally hummed along beside us, and when we’d pick up speed, Charley would yell out words of encouragement.
In general, the camp wasn’t about taking hard strokes, putting together the fastest eights, or racing—which was perfect for me because I probably wasn’t ready for that. However, Charley had a way of making you feel like you were inching closer to perfection with each stroke.
At the end of camp, Charley met with each of us to discuss our progress over the week. He asked me if I had any aspirations to row in college. When I said that I hadn’t really thought about that, he said I might want to. Charley thought a bunch of us had real potential and that if I wanted to, I could row for a top team someday.
After camp, I remember going home and informing my parents that not only did I love crew but I also thought that I might want to try and row in college.
Now a senior on Radcliffe here at Harvard, I’ve become pretty accustomed to seeing Charley’s launch zoom by us on the river, tailing his lightweights. He almost never fails to call out a “Go Radcliffe!” through his megaphone.
Each time I see him go by or chat with him for a story, I can’t help but think back to that summer. For me, it’s nice to think back now, in my senior year, on all of those experiences and people who guided me to where I am today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My family comes together for three holidays every year: Harvard-Yale, Christmas, and the Super Bowl. And when it comes to family tradition, the latter two can’t compare. It’s impossible to describe my family without mentioning The Game we hold so dear.
My first memories of Harvard-Yale have about as much to do with football as most of the Super Bowl commercials do. I was too short to see the action and often too cold to care. What I remember most from my early years are frostbitten hands, food, and a seemingly endless amount of time spent standing in front of a car.
Eventually, the action on the field caught my eye, and I began to be curious about this mysterious game going on in front of me.
It took me forever to understand why teams would punt on fourth down instead of going for it. If eight-year-old me were in charge of a football team, she would’ve gone for a touchdown on every play.
As I became a football-obsessed middle schooler, The Game turned into an event I looked forward to every fall. I watched professional football on T.V. all the time, but because I was busy with soccer and later cross country, Harvard-Yale was often the only time I had the chance to see football in person.
And if you asked me what my favorite weekend of middle school was, I wouldn’t have hestitated: sixth grade Harvard-Yale in New Haven, Conn.
While The Game has always been a family activity, this time two of my friends were coming, too. I remember endless games of catch and pick-up football.
And this was middle school, before all the boys became faster runners than all the girls, so I had game.
I almost didn’t want to leave the tailgate, but the action on the field proved to be more than worth it. Behind Neil Rose ’03, the Crimson topped the Bulldogs, 35-23, for its first perfect season in 88 years.
Back in the parking lot after the final whistle had blown, my family stayed to throw around the football, wishing the day would never end.
Then there was The Game I almost missed my sophomore year of high school. I don’t think I’ve ever showered as fast as I did after that morning’s basketball practice.
I wanted to take the time to stretch because the tendonitis in my knees was bothering me, but because I knew my mom was risking being late just for me, I skipped it.
Somehow, despite the horrific traffic, despite the fact that my mom had to pull over on the side of the highway so I could go to the bathroom, and despite the fact that my dad had inexplicably taken out all the CDs in the car save for one Enrique Iglesias album (which I’m still not sure why we own), my mom and I made it to New Haven on speaking terms.
With the Crimson down 21-3 at halftime, it looked like our trip had been in vain.
Instead, we bore witness to a remarkable comeback, where Harvard scored on a two-point conversation to bring the game into overtime for the first time in the rivalry’s history.
After the Crimson had won the Ivy League’s first ever triple-overtime contest, my mom had one thing to say.
“Yale deserved to win that game.”
Perhaps. But it didn’t.
Some might say the same about last year’s game, when a Bulldog victory seemed all but guaranteed heading into the fourth quarter.
In the post-game press conference after the Crimson’s surprising 2009 victory, one of Harvard’s receivers, Matt Luft ’10, appeared to be missing a glove.
It wasn’t long before I found out what happened to it: after the game, my brother stormed the field, and Luft had been kind enough to grant his request for a glove.
Just as I can’t imagine my family without Harvard-Yale, my perception of The Game wouldn’t be complete without an understanding of my family’s involvement in it.
It’s people like my grandparents—perennial tailgaters—who embody the true meaning of Harvard-Yale.
Even though it seems to be all about competition and winning, The Game is really a celebration of community, and I think that is why my family’s connection to it has never faded.
My cousins and I have grown and changed over the years, but there’s still nowhere we’d rather be on the Saturday before Thanksgiving than at Harvard-Yale watching the Crimson take on the Bulldogs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fans of Harvard men’s basketball will receive their first glimpse at the new-look squad tonight at Lavietes Pavilion, where the Crimson will host Holy Cross in its home opener.
Harvard’s kickoff to the season last year saw the Crimson take down the Crusaders on the road in a convincing 87-77 win that established the tone for the rest of a record-setting campaign.
But this evening’s matchup provides an opportunity for Harvard to make a different sort of statement: that even without its two top players from last season, the Crimson will be able to compete throughout a challenging non-conference schedule.
While Holy Cross returns four out of their five starters from ’09-’10, Harvard continues to adjust to the absence of Jeremy Lin ’10—whose 24 points against Holy Cross were a game-high—and sophomore stud Kyle Casey, who is out with a broken foot.
Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said Monday that the forward’s rehabilitation is proceeding according to schedule; Casey is slated to return to action before the start of Ivy play.
Instead, Harvard will need to rely on big man Keith Wright, who played perhaps the game of his collegiate career Saturday on the road against George Mason. The junior co-captain collected 22 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, earning him the title of Ivy League Player of the Week.
Wright’s dominant performance was just about the only bright spot for Amaker’s squad, which shot 33 percent from the field in the 66-53 loss to the Patriots.
“Without Keith, the way we shot it from the perimeter...[the losing margin] could have been 35,” Amaker said.
Though its backcourt is regarded as Harvard’s strength, the team found very little success outside the paint in its season opener.
Typically solid shooters, sophomore guards Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster combined to go 5-for-22 from the field, including nine missed three-pointers.
Heralded freshman Laurent Rivard had an inauspicious start to his rookie season, missing all 11 shots he took from the floor, but he certainly has the green light to keep firing away.
“Laurent’s already probably one of the best shooters in the Ivy League, and the reason why is he puts a lot of work in,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “I know he’s been in the gym since the last game...he gets up a lot of reps, and works really hard at his shooting. He’ll be fine going forward.”
And as was also the case last season, taking care of the ball was a major issue Saturday. Harvard had 24 turnovers on the day—giving it away about one of every three possessions—leading to 24 George Mason points.
While the shots may simply begin to fall upon the team’s return to the comforts of its home gym, the importance of improved decision-making on offense is clear.
“It’s just knowing what your role is,” McNally said of the solution to the turnover problem. “The people who are supposed to be playmakers and taking risks with the ball...need to do that, and the people who aren’t shouldn’t be doing that. Everyone knowing their roles, so you don’t get out of your comfort zone on offense—that’ll translate into fewer turnovers for the team.”
The veteran point guard and his young teammates will be tested by the experienced Crusaders, who bring back five double-digit scorers and were picked to finish fourth in the Patriot League preseason poll.
The biggest change for Holy Cross has been the introduction of first-year coach Milan Brown, who will lean on junior guards Mike Cavataio, R.J. Evans, and Devin Brown. Cavataio and Evans each had 16 points in a season-opening loss to the College of Charleston on Saturday.
“You’re looking at some guys there who’ve been around,” Amaker said. “They’re playing up-tempo, they’re playing aggressive man-to-man...they’re not afraid to put some points on the board.”
Center Andrew Keister, a preseason all-Patriot League selection, holds down the interior for the Crusaders. He posted a team-high 22 points and eight rebounds against the Crimson last year and is coming off a double-double—the 20th of his career—against the Cougars a few days ago.
Given its dearth of experience in the frontcourt—little-used sophomore Jeff Georgatos received the start against George Mason—it would not be surprising to see the Crimson utilize a small lineup tonight and in the upcoming weeks before Casey’s return.
“I can see us doing that, based on some of the lineups [Holy Cross] has shown in a couple of scrimmages and its first game,” Amaker said.
Whether it plays four guards or not, Harvard is sure to have its hands full with a Holy Cross squad looking to exact its revenge on a Lin-less lineup.

When most Harvard students look around at their peers, they see diversity. Diversity of races, orientations, religions, cultures, ethnicities, and just about anything else is easy to find among students at Harvard. However, there's one thing at Harvard that isn't quite so diverse: our walls.
Walking through the dining halls and the common rooms of the houses, you will see many portraits of wealthy-looking, white, high-collared individuals—who were, no doubt, benefactors or faculty at Harvard. With a centuries-long history of elitism at Harvard, it's not surprising that many of Harvard's historical benefactors and faculty were white, and the portraits reflect that.
According to The Boston Globe, in 2002 there were 750 portraits at Harvard, 690 of which were of white men. Of these portraits, only two were of minorities, and the others were of white women.
The Harvard Foundation has made efforts to change these statistics.
In a recent move to reflect the diversity of individuals who have served the University over the past 25 years, the Harvard Foundation has launched the Harvard Foundation Portraiture Project.
The project aims to diversify these portraits by funding portraits of minority alumni, faculty, and other individuals related to the University. So far, the project has hung eight portraits of minority faculty members and two of white faculty members who have helped further diversity at Harvard.
Portraits have been hung in many of the upperclassmen houses, the Medical School, and University Hall.
The next portrait is scheduled to be unveiled next month, and will picture Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, who in 1665 became the first Native American to graduate from Harvard.
The Foundation has scheduled the unveilings of five more portraits over the next two years.

The Department of Athletics will be prohibiting vuvuzelas—the South African horns that gained popularity after the World Cup this past summer—inside Harvard Stadium during this Saturday's Harvard-Yale Game.
In an e-mail with the subject line "Vuvzelas not permitted at Harvard/Yale," Associate Director of Athletics Timothy W. Wheaton wrote that the vuvuzelas would "both disrupt play on the field and detract from the overall fan experience for many spectators."
Some members of the Harvard University Band and the Yale Precision Marching Band have expressed concern about the effect the vuvuzelas would have on their performances, but as recently as last week, Wheaton said that the vuvuzelas would be permitted.

UPDATE 1:00 a.m.
The original video has been made private on YouTube. There is now a new video that no longer contains the question about the Yale graduate student who was murdered last year.
Gearing up for The Game this weekend? Watch On Harvard Time’s new video to find out what life is really like in New Haven.
In this parody of Yale’s infamous admissions video, the basic concept has changed very little. A Yale admissions rep, giving a traditional college information spiel, bursts into a “High School Musical” style exposé. The twist? The protagonist came to Yale because he didn’t get into Harvard.
The resulting journey shows us what life at Yale is really like, lending more credence than ever to that old saying, “New Haven looks better in the dark.” Dining halls, classrooms, and dark alleyways are the setting of this musical. The characters? Hookers, hobos, Spiderman, and angry teachers.
But despite the sometimes-lighthearted humor, the video has attracted national attention for an off-color joke about a recent death.
In the video one character asks, “What happened to that girl who got murdered and stuffed in a wall?”
The Yale Daily News has published an editorial titled “Taking the rivalry too far,” which criticizes the video.
“By making light of one of the most horrific tragedies to strike our campus in recent memory, the murder of Annie Le GRD ’13 last September, the video’s authors exhibited a gross insensitivity that they may not have intended, but elicited a response that they should have expected. For Yalies to ridicule Mark Zuckerberg, or for Cantabs to lampoon George W. Bush ’68 is one thing — but to poke fun at real suffering is inexcusable,” it reads.
The Associated Press has also released a news article about the video. And Gawker ran a critical post about the video.
The OHT video has received over 10,000 views so far.

With less than 24 hours to go before voting closes, all three UC tickets are making a last-ditch effort to secure student support, and candidates Collin A. Jones ’12 and Peter D. Davis ’12 are no exception.
In a hectic week that included a trip to PetSmart, two profiles in The Crimson, and an On Harvard Time interview, the latest news from the Jones-Davis campaign is an official endorsement from The Darker Side (TDS). The Darker Side is WHRB’s “late-night hip-hop, soul, funk, R&B, reggae, and electronic music department,” according to their website.
The radio program announced its support in a press release.
"The Jones-Davis campaign has taken The Darker Side’s DJs by storm, with long e-mail threads on their private hip-hop mailing list discussing the merits and virtues of the three pillars Jones and Davis have discussed,” according to the release.
Those of you who are up-to-date on your UC election news, however, will know that TDS is actually Jones-Davis’s second official endorsement.
Early Tuesday morning, the Harvard- Radcliffe Society of Physics Students became the first student group to throw its support behind the pair, stating in a press release,  “While all campaigns have brought some respectable gravity to this year's ballot, the one of the many planks of the many platforms that truly spoke to us was Jones-Davis's promise to Bring Harvard into the 21st Century (we’re assuming this means we get a large-scale synchotron.”
Meanwhile, Jones and Davis had this to say, “It is obvious after early results and voter opinions that we are currently the front-runner favorites in the UC election. As a result, it makes sense that reputable student groups like the Harvard-Radcliffe Society for Physics Students and The Darker Side choose to endorse the projected winner.”
