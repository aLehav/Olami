After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
 
Microbiology 213: “Social Issues in Biology”—a graduate-level biology course taught by Harvard Medical School Professor Jonathan R. Beckwith, who, back in 1969, isolated the first gene from a bacterial chromosome—sounds intimidating. But students in Microbiology 213 will not be churning out scientific papers to be published in Nature any time soon—instead, they are producing a play.
Their piece, entitled “The Edge of the Map,” will run April 12 to 14 in Science Center 302 and delves deeply into the ethical issues that connect biology and medicine to the human experience. Professor Beckwith has taught this class for over 20 years, but this is the first year that the class has produced a theater piece. Genetic identity, Huntington’s Disease, designer babies, and compulsory sterilization are just a few of the tangled topics that New York-based director Catherine “Calla” Videt ’08-’09  hints will feature in the experimental narrative of the play. “We will address questions of how much we choose to know about ourselves genetically, what we should pass on to our future generations, what it means to have children, and how much we want to control any of these things,” Videt says.
Benjamin T. Morris ’09, a Ph.D student at the Harvard Medical School and a teaching fellow for the class, was able to collect talent from the greater Harvard community. The class attracted theatrically minded undergrads as well as talented alumni like Videt to help write and produce the show.The class and the theater project are two separate entities that Beckwith and Morris hope will feed organically off each other, with some students involved mostly in the art-making portion rather than in the class. Students in the class will also engage in other avenues for creative expression through media such as Twitter.
The theater piece also explores bringing new ways of learning about science to the theater. According to Mariel N. Pettee ’14, who is producing, choreographing, and acting in the production, some experimental techniques that the production uses may engage audience members in new ways, like moving them physically around the performance space. Pettee says she and Videt had preliminary discussions about distributing audio files to the audience, but ultimately decided not to do so.
The play will incorporate a number of different interwoven narratives. Videt says that some characters draw upon the lives of real people, like a Canadian woman sterilized against her will and a patient with Huntington’s; other characters are new creations. Some storylines will be set in the present, and others in the future. Morris described the plot as fragmentary, and Videt described it as a collage.
Pettee, while she is involved only in the show and not the class, remarks that the class is progressive. “It is the only class that engages with science and art in a concrete way, a more-than-abstract way, ending in an actual piece of performance art,” she says.
Morris hopes that the play will have a life beyond this one semester at Harvard. After its first run in April, the production team hopes to take the show to New York sometime in August. Ultimately, the class and its constantly changing format is a response to what professor Beckwith calls the unfortunate prevailing culture of science.
“A life outside of science is discouraged, and scientists have taken little ethical responsibility with their work,” Beckwith says. His success in 1969 in isolating a gene forced him to face the ethical dilemmas of the future of science. Beckwith’s concern that biologists in this era may not realize the human ramifications of their discoveries is the primary motivation for this project and class.
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: April 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article misstated the course title of Microbiology 213: “Social Issues in Biology.” The article also incorrectly stated that in 1969 Harvard Medical School Professor Jonathan R. Beckwith isolated the first bacterial genome. In fact, Beckwith led a team that isolated the first gene from a bacterial chromosome. In addition, the article incorrectly stated that students in Microbiology 213 are writing a play, while in fact they are producing a play written by Harvard students in collaboration with New York-based director Catherine “Calla” Videt ’08-’09 and a professional playwright.
CORRECTIONS: April 11, 2013
The headline of an earlier version of this article and a statement in the story incorrectly stated the location of a microbiology course's upcoming performance. In fact, that production will take place in Science Center 302, not at Arts @ 29 Garden. In addition, the story incorrectly stated that the organizers of the performance had discussed giving iPods to the audience. In fact, organizers had talked about distributing MP3 files to audience members, and ultimately decided not to do so. The story also misstated the title of the performance, “The Edge of the Map.”

It  might be refreshing to look at recent financial crises and bailouts  with some measure of hilarity. And that’s just what the new  Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ musical, “Utopia,  Limited; or, The Flowers of Progress,” which opened in Agassiz Theatre  last night and will run through April 7, aims to do. 
Set  on the island of Utopia, the production deals with the return of the  King’s daughter, Zara, who, fresh out of Cambridge University, seeks to  reform Utopia by imitating British-style institutions. Her efforts lead,  however, to devastatingly farcical outcomes.
“Utopia,  Limited” lampoons personalities that might be familiar to our recent  economic crisis, placing them in a distinctly Victorian English setting.  A diverse cast of unemployed doctors, lawyers, corrupt government  officials, and shady corporations deliver the distinctive patter singing  and panache of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. 
Though  “Utopia, Limited” is lesser known than other Gilbert and Sullivan  productions such as “The Pirates of Penzance,” Music Director Dylan J.  Nagler ’14  says that the operetta offers a typical Gilbert and Sullivan plot  draped in a satire of British culture. “In addition to a lot of fun  music, it is surprisingly relevant to today’s world; there’s a lot of  economic satire,” Nagler says. 
Director C.E. Chiemeka Ezie ’15,  a Crimson Arts editor, acknowledges the play’s uniqueness. “There’s a  little bit more caustic wit on the part of Gilbert than usual,” Ezie  says. Veering away from the problematic suggestion of Western supremacy,  Ezie has chosen to set Utopia in a fantastical cloud setting instead of  an island, as called for in the script. “Some of the aspects of the  show that assert cultural superiority might tend to distract people from  actual point of show,” Ezie says. “The play is critiquing sententious,  holier-than-thou attitudes.” 
"Utopia"  promises the trademark Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire of clipped  consonants and pointed diction along with smatterings of barmy British  satire. The musical is politically and socially charged, particularly  when placed against the backdrop of America’s own capitalist tale.

CNN’s coverage of the Steubenville trial stirred outrage last week, focusing as it did on the guilty verdict’s effects on the rapists. Reporting from outside the courthouse, Poppy Harlow said “it was very difficult to watch” as their “promising futures...fell apart.” Needless to say, this was a rape case, not “Bohemian Rhapsody,” and the misplaced pathos was as tasteless as it was unfair, excusing two people who had total agency in their violent crime. Our sympathies are with the victim first, just as they would be with any other person targeted by a violent crime. To think otherwise discounts the horror she experienced and minimizes the savagery central to sexual assault.
 It is easy to condemn Steubenville and CNN in a vacuum, and they certainly deserve to be pilloried. Yet, we must acknowledge that, far from being idiosyncratic aberrations from a culture otherwise cognizant of the plight of sexual violence, these instances betray a deeper problem in the way many in America misunderstand and misrepresent cases of sexual assault. Rape culture is a hideous, hearty weed on the lawn of American social life. Prolific, it shows up all over, not just in cable news schlock shops. 
 Last year, in its coverage of the gang rape of an 11-year-old girl in Cleveland, Texas, The New York Times was blasted—and later apologized—for an article that discussed the adolescent’s make-up and manner of dress, quoting extensively from locals who engaged in rank victim-blaming. 
 Even before Harlow ran her mouth, rape culture was written all over this case. Coverage seemed to harp on the fact that when she was attacked at a party, the Steubenville teenager was heavily intoxicated, with certain onlookers even charging that she brought the crime on herself. Many in the town closed ranks around the perpetrators, obstructing prosecution until the story, scattered across social media in the form of trophy photographs and videos, hit television news and was further publicized by the hacker group Anonymous. When one of the rapists apologized to his victim after being found guilty, he did not express remorse for his behavior, only regrets that the images had been sent around online.
 And after CNN’s wrongheaded coverage, the trend continued. Fox News, airing footage from the courtroom, inadvertently revealed the victim’s identity, allowing her tormentors to find her on Twitter and subject her to a barrage of hate and death threats. (This represented not only a break with human compassion, but also a departure from accepted journalistic conventions, which generally protect the names of minors who are crime victims.)
 As Steubenville recedes into relative anonymity, it is important to hold onto its core lesson: Rape culture is alive and well, in towns across America and within the walls of the newsroom.

CNN’s coverage of the Steubeville rape case was, in a word, embarrassing. Without acknowledging the trauma of the victim, multiple reporters spoke sadly about how the rapists’ bright futures had been ruined by being found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl, without seeming to grasp the simple concept that the rapists had ruined their own futures by raping someone. But CNN and other news outlets were not alone in lamenting the fates of these young men, and, in fact, seemed to be giving voice to what an uncomfortably large slice of America was thinking. The obvious explanation of victim-blaming and valuation of perpetrators over their victims does have some hold here, but a full understanding of the situation needs to be more nuanced. So my question is: What, exactly, are the social mores and the mechanisms within rape culture that brought about this phenomenon?
The answer seems to lie in the concept of “positive futurity,” which is most simply defined as the valuing of a possible positive future over present realities. Positive futurity says that although the perpetrators in the Steubenville case made a “mistake,” there is still a possibility that they could leave that mistake in the past and not let it ruin their prospects for the future. Furthermore, it automatically sets the onus for creating these possible futures on the survivor. This is the heart of the matter. Yes, rape culture leads people to blame survivors for being assaulted, but the cultural insistence on women showing forgiveness leads to a different yet complementary set of problems.
Even if no one explicitly admits, even to themselves, that they believe the victim in a rape case should forgive their perpetrator(s), a deep attachment to the possibility of forgiveness on the victim’s part is implicit in the preoccupation with idea that the perpetrators could, conceivably, live full and meaningful lives in the future. If the victim had been killed, she would be unable to show forgiveness, and the futures of the perpetrators would be seen as sealed. But as long as she is alive (and not only alive, but not visibly physically damaged), there is a perceived possibility of everyone moving past what happened, of the damage being fixable, of the whole situation being a matter of forgiveness, as difficult as that forgiveness might be.
However, what none of this reasoning takes into account is the fact that these young men made a choice of their own free will, and not only that, but also made a choice to commit an unfathomably violent crime. Thus, we are imagining these possible positive futures while failing to see that they are no longer possibilities. These young men ruined the possibilities for those futures, relinquished their feasibility, the second they chose to rape this young woman—long before the trial began.
Furthermore, positive futurity and this narrative of forgiveness also perpetuate the idea that the victim, too, can look toward a positive future, that she can grow from what happened, that “what doesn’t kill her makes her stronger,” and this is just as harmful. As long as we portray sexual violence as something that not only inherently can be moved past, but also as something that necessarily makes the survivor a better, stronger, and more nuanced person when she is able to move on, we are discrediting the lasting damage that sexual violence often does to survivors. And what’s more, this narrative of self-growth further contributes to creating a situation in which a desire for justice is instead read as bitterness, as the victim is seen as holding onto something that she can, and should, instead let go of.
How, then, do we reconcile this disappointment with continued prosecution, this sadness at the perceived ruination of these imagined futures, with our attraction as a society to the concept of revenge? With our appreciation of Lisbeth Salander’s revenge against her rapist in the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, for instance? I would argue that we understand vigilante justice and legal justice in two very different ways: we appreciate the former because it transcends the very system that the latter relies upon. The law holds a special, foundational sort of place in our society, and the idea of victims relying on this system to achieve justice conjures up all sorts of social expectations and desires for “normal” and “positive” behavior. Legal justice functions within a framework of social norms, whereas vigilante revenge fantasies deliberately transcend those social norms, which is precisely why we find them so thrilling.
This comparison is helpful in understanding just how deeply the idea of forgiveness is rooted in social norms, rather than in any sort of objective reasoning: we either understand the proper outcome for a case of sexual violence as an eye for an eye, done outside of society, or as the opposite, forgiveness, which is appropriate within society. And though I am not advocating for a move toward vigilante justice, I am suggesting that we need to see a sea change in the way that we think about sexual violence and forgiveness, and start moving toward a place where we actually understand and accept, as a society, the consequences of the decision to commit acts of sexual violence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spotting a gay conservative is like seeing a unicorn; you’re breathless as you scrounge in your bag for a camera to capture this majestic site. But before you know it, they’ve galloped away.
In light of this, consider when a conservative politician like Jon Huntsman comes out in favor of gay marriage—is he doing this to appeal to his swarms of gay supporters? No. I don’t recall seeing a Huntsman float in the gay pride parade. How much political capital do Republicans stand to gain by supporting gay marriage? Not much, though maybe some on the left choose to hate them a little less. Infrequently can one know for sure if a Democrat really supports gay marriage or if they are trying to gain public appeal from their rainbow constituents.
Now consider how many Republicans have come out in favor of gay marriage. There’s Ohio Senator Rob Portman, former first lady Laura Bush, Meg Whitman, and Clint Eastwood. Then we have Colin “empowerment” Powell, Cindy ain’t-no-sin McCain, Arnold equality-or-eat-my Schwarzenegger, Michael give-them-their-blooming-rights Bloomberg, and of course Jon Huntsman and-marries-him.
Did I mention that all of these supporters came out of the traditional marriage closet before Hillary Clinton? Moreover, can you guess which Republican endorsed gay marriage before Barack Obama? Here’s a hint—he’s the first person to come to mind at the word “fabulous.” Dick Cheney.
Now, can you guess the political affiliation of the federal attorney currently arguing for marriage equality before the Supreme Court?  As you might have guessed (the title is something of a give away) he’s a Republican. In fact, he’s an uber-Republican. Ted Olson was George W. Bush’s solicitor general, the founder of the Federalist society, and serves on the board of the American Spectator, a conservative magazine. He’s as Republican as genetically modified apple pie.
Ted Olson joins the ranks of a long and storied tradition of Republican enfranchisement. Many are aware that it was a Republican who freed and enfranchised the slaves. Few, however, know that Republican president Theodore Roosevelt was the first to endorse women’s suffrage while the Democrats stood in strong opposition. The first woman elected to congress was a rancher from Montana—yep, definitely a Republican. Finally, it was Republican Governator Arnold Schwarzenegger who first began the suit to repeal Prop 8.
The court may likely strike down the Defense of Marriage Act (signed into law by a well known Democrat, by the way), but this still means that gay marriage must be won state by state thereafter. If this is the case, proponents of marriage equality will need conservative help more than ever.
Oh sure, it’s all fun and games to make an elaborate portrait of Rick Santorum’s face out of a gay porn collage (Google with caution). But this is not going to change any minds and neither will protests, public displays of affection, or profile pictures.  In fact, all of these things will marginalize, alienate, and galvanize the very people proponents of marriage equality should be talking to—those who oppose it. Talking is a good step but listening is paramount. It is important to understand why people do not support gay marriage. Who better to listen and understand than the very people who share their party affiliation? Conservatives know conservatives. This is why conservatives have led the most successful lawsuits in favor of marriage equality. We know whom we have to convince and we know how.
Conservatives believe in individuals and the equality of opportunity. Gay people should have equal opportunity for marriage and the freedom to screw it up just like 40 percent of straight couples. Freedom-loving conservatives are fully capable of sticking up for our guns, our God, and our gay people.
Those belonging to the “Christian Right” may also find reasons to condone gay marriage. To use the words of John Donne out of context, gay marriage is “not yet a breach, but an expansion” of the institution of marriage. It takes a rather pessimistic view of faith and humanity to think the integrity of marriage will not weather this expansion.
As many proponents of gay marriage are careful to point out, gaining the institution of marriage is winning the battle but not the war. Withholding certain legal privileges to gay people are but the trappings of intolerance. A fanatic can assault a woman’s girlfriend just as easily as a woman’s wife. Denial of gay marriage comes from a socially acceptable disapproval of homosexuality or disregard of homosexuality. Changing people’s minds about homosexual marriage is not as simple as overturning the law. For gay people to marry, five out of nine people have to be convinced. For gay people to feel welcome anywhere in the U.S., three-hundred million people have to be convinced.

I’ve been giving President Drew G. Faust the benefit of the doubt through the many Harvard scandals over the past year, but her handling of the Resident Dean email search debacle is where I draw the line.
Faust’s response has been three-pronged: simultaneously deny responsibility for the searches, assure others of their proper execution, and refuse to address the searches’ ethical implications.
It’s a bold strategy, Cotton. Let’s see if it pays off for her.
First: deny responsibility.
Faust, doing her best Godfather impression, says, “Back in September, I was made aware that there was concern about a potential breach in the confidentiality of the [Ad Board] process, and was told it had been resolved. But I was not informed of specifics.”
Isn’t it troubling that her subordinates did not consult her before they performed a (supposedly) unprecedented and certain-to-be controversial search at a time when the university was already under the national microscope? Is Faust so disconnected from the day-to-day events at Harvard that Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean Michael D. Smith saw nothing unusual about that? Why in the world would Faust not ask for specifics about a complication regarding Harvard’s largest scandal in recent history?
Call me crazy, but I think a university president, even a Harvard president, should be more connected to the community she leads.
Second: assure others of their proper execution.
In the same statement in which she denied knowing about the searches, Faust said, “I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned, especially our students.”
I’m glad Faust is okay with that, but her feelings after the fact are irrelevant. She needed to feel comfortable with the searches before they happened.
Mostly, though, Faust has left Hammonds and Smith to defend their searches on their own.
Ironically, the searches themselves were justified. A confidential memo and Ad Board conversation somehow found their way to the media. The administration repeatedly asked the guilty Resident Dean to step forward, and threatened an “investigation” if no one did. No one did.
Here is where Hammonds and Smith messed up. First, they didn’t specifically threaten to search inboxes, so their current defense that they warned Resident Deans about an investigation rings hollow to the faculty. As Professor Harry R. Lewis said, if the searches were ethical, why did Smith and Hammonds need to hide their possibility?
Second, the Resident Deans’ status as either faculty or staff is unclear and subject to various interpretations. Though they are not technically faculty, they do share some of the faculty privileges and are listed as FAS members in the Harvard directory. However, the faculty email policy requires notification of a search of email accounts (though the administration refuses to confirm that the faculty policy applies to Resident Dean email accounts). Yet Hammonds and Smith only notified the Resident Dean who was discovered to have inadvertently forwarded the memo. They only notified other resident deans after the Boston Globe approached them about the search, months later. Smith and Hammonds claim to have immediately informed Senior Resident Dean Sharon Howell, but she and an anonymous Harvard official contradict that.
What explains this failure to notify, which seriously damaged the faculty’s trust in the administration? Smith and Hammonds say the lack of notification “protected the privacy of the Resident Dean who had made an inadvertent error and allowed the student cases being handled by this Resident Dean to move forward expeditiously.”
Smith and Hammonds seem to imply that outing the Resident Dean at fault would have resulted in his or her removal and the delay of his or her students’ Ad Board cases. Lewis finds it unlikely that other Resident Deans would have demanded the head of a colleague who had made an honest mistake. Besides, Lewis says, it’s only right to tell people that you are violating the privacy of their inbox, and to explain why. Hard to argue with that, especially since Howell told Hammonds in September that email searches would be “sort of drastic and problematic.”
Third: refuse to address the searches’ ethical implications.
Howell sent a letter asking Faust to explain her thoughts on the searches, Faust came closest to addressing the issue in her comment the same day: “Questions about whether more resident deans should have been informed sooner are fair to ask.”
So Faust’s personal opinion on the searches is…what? An answer would have been better than bureaucratic evasiveness.
In sum, the administration screwed this one up big time. It compromised the trust of both faculty and students. Faculty may now begin to eschew FAS accounts and students were swapping rumors that the Office of Student Life might have been monitoring list-serves for River Run festivities, which they have denied. Some worry that Resident Deans are no longer trusted confidants.
Faust appears bent on never saying anything unscripted or conceivably offensive (the ghost of Larry Summers haunts her, perhaps). But being a leader sometimes means having the guts to take charge. When will Faust?

The sight of students hunched over, burdened by an overflowing bag of books, is all too familiar in Harvard Yard. But with Harvard University Press’s digital content partnership agreement with AcademicPub, it may soon become a thing of the past.
In only its second year, AcademicPub is an online platform that allows faculty to package individual units of content, such as articles, textbook chapters, scholarly research, and cases, into one customized textbook.
The Press is one of 16 major publishers that announced a partnership with AcademicPub Tuesday, joining over 200 academic publishers and 4,000 faculty users.
“The traditional textbook has become very expensive and not necessarily current in the discipline or class you are teaching. Professors are looking for alternatives and ways both to choose what they want and to save their students money,” said Caroline Vanderlip, CEO of AcademicPub’s parent company, SharedBook Inc. “Harvard University Press is one of the renowned university presses in the country with very scholarly and well respected work. We were very excited they wanted to be part of the platform,” she said.
Several Harvard professors, including those teaching many of the College’s largest courses—Life Sciences 1a, Government 20, and Justice—have already shown a preference for these more personal models, and have created course packs or other customized student resources.
Chemistry professor James G. Anderson actually wrote his own textbook for Physical Sciences 11 when he could not find one that fit his course’s unique structure.
Anderson responded enthusiastically when asked if he thought his colleagues would utilize resources like AcademicPub.
“Definitely. Anything that brings more flexibility will help immensely,” he said.
In addition to streamlining material specifically curated and aligned with courses, the partnership is in line with Harvard University Press’s goals of increasing professor visibility and course content availability, Stephanie Vyce, Harvard University Press director of intellectual property and subsidiary rights, said in an email.

Rather than being “entirely heterosexual” or “entirely homosexual,” one’s identity is dynamic and fluid, according to speaker and activist Robyn T. Ochs, who spoke at an interactive session called “Beyond Binaries” on Thursday.
During the session, Ochs discussed the importance of moving away from the simple homosexual-heterosexual categories, and emphasized the need to recognize the complexity of sexual identity.
“If we don’t fit neatly into existing categories, it means the categories are problematic, not us,” Ochs said.
Sharing her own experience in coming out as bisexual, Ochs pointed out the lack of acceptance of nontraditional identities.
“I felt like to say anything was stepping off a cliff into the unknown,” Ochs said.
After identifying some shortcomings in previous research that attempted to graph sexual orientation, Ochs designed a new model that demonstrates how sexual identities are fluid and changing.
The audience members engaged in a group activity that involved a more flexible and inclusive way of visually portraying sexual identities.
Ochs first had them fill out an anonymous survey that numerically portrayed their sexual orientation and attractions.
After receiving someone else’s survey, participants stood on a spectrum from 0 to 6, with 0 being entirely heterosexual and 6 being entirely homosexual.
Ochs emphasized that her model was a continuum, not just a scale, and that there was space outside the continuum for those who did not feel they fit the survey.
Heidi M. Hurst ’15, who participated in the session, said that she thought this way of portraying identity was insightful, and it was “validating that people conceive gender in so many different ways.”
“It gave me a healthy dose of appreciation for nuance when trying to portray someone’s identity,” Hurst said.
Edith C. Benavides ’14, an intern who also organized the event, said she thought the session provided a supportive environment for participants by creating the “right amount of comfort and discomfort.”
“A little bit of community was created,” Benavides said.

Screenwriter Geoffrey S. Fletcher ’92, most famous for writing the film “Precious,” reflected on his growth from a Harvard student with a passion for films to an Academy Award winner Thursday afternoon at a small table discussion with students.
Inside the dining hall in Kirkland—his former House—he recalled many late nights watching movies.
Fletcher noted that though there was no screenwriting class while he was at Harvard, he made many films during his four years.
When assigned papers for his courses, he would routinely make films instead.
A psychology concentrator, Fletcher said he appreciated the lessons of his degree before attending film school at New York University.
After graduating from the College, Fletcher’s first break came in 1996 when John Singleton, director of Boyz in the Hood, expressed interest in developing a short film of Fletcher’s called “Magic Markers,” into a feature film.
The deal fell through, which resulted in an 11-year period during which Fletcher did not have a major film project.
During that time, Fletcher held down odd jobs before becoming an adjunct professor of screenwriting at both New York University and Columbia University.
But this time in the “wilderness” between the prospective offer and writing “Precious,” Fletcher said, was key to the power of the award-winning script.
“You think filmmaker takes place between action and cut, no, it’s the weeks, months, lifetimes before,” Fletcher said.
Fletcher recognized the power of the script as he wrote it, becoming increasingly excited and realizing how far into sadness he had slipped before beginning work on this project, he said.
Fletcher described the film’s producers, Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey, as “angels” who shepherded “Precious” towards its eventual commercial success.
He advised the attendees, several of whom were screenwriters, that plot and humanity are key to a successful movie.
As someone who has written many screenplays which have been taken up and a professor of the subject, Fletcher cautioned students of the importance of a solid plot.
“A draft can be a 60-page road to nowhere if you aren’t careful,” Fletcher said.
Fletcher said that his success as a writer has contributed to his decision to try writing and directing films.
Following the talk, Fletcher screened his unreleased film “Violet and Daisy.”

Actor Jason Alexander, of “Seinfeld” fame, held a Chapstick tube to his lips as a faux cigarette while making farting noises alongside members of the Immediate Gratification Players on Thursday.
In a Science Center lecture hall that, minutes before, had been packed with students taking a chemistry midterm, Alexander and the IGP kept an audience of students in stitches at the 2013 Immediate Gratification Player of the Year ceremony.
Sporting one of the group’s signature red-and-gold ties, Alexander recounted stories about his life that were equal parts honest, crass, and comical. The IGP then performed skits inspired by the personal anecdotes.
For one part of the ceremony, Alexander took individual words from the audience to fuel his stories.
During this portion, one student shouted out, “sex!” to which Alexander responded, “I expected more from Harvard. Fortunately it is a subject I am an expert in. Wow, there are so many to pick from.”
This suggestion launched Alexander into a story about his college years when, as an undergraduate at Boston University, he had sexual relations with a graduate student named Robin who worked at The Naked Eye, a strip club in Boston’s red light district.
“Does that still exist?” Alexander asked.
“We call it The Quad,” yelled Jake W. C. Silberg ’15, a member of IGP, from behind.
As the story progressed, Alexander recalled how he had returned from college after his freshman year to engage in sexual relations with his high school girlfriend—still a minor at the time.
Alexander said that a policeman caught them in the act and the story ended with Alexander trying to bribe the girl’s father to avoid being charged as a rape offender.
The IGP worked off of this story to produce improvised skits that included a reunion between Robin and the main character’s wife and a mistake visit to an optometrist called “The Naked Eye.”
Mid-way through the ceremony, it was revealed that a student had been hiding in a desk behind the performers. After briefly waving to the crowd, the student was escorted out by a police officer.
“We had to kill him,” said Alexander after the student left.
Alexander then participated in more skits with the members of IGP, offering two more embarrassing stories about a party in Los Angeles and a fake sexual encounter behind a glass case of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.
As a preface to the museum story, Alexander mentioned filming his widely-panned movie “North,” which received laughs from someone in the back of the lecture hall.
To this Alexander promptly extended his middle finger.
Alexander ended by saying, “If you enjoyed this performance, there is one other thing I suggest you do: storm the admissions office. I have a son, his name is Noah Alexander, and he would very much like to go here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty members praised Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, specifically highlighting his work promoting education, after his announcement Thursday afternoon that he would not seek a sixth term in office.
“Mayor Menino has been a powerful advocate for the role that education and research play in fueling innovation and prosperity, as well as expanding horizons and enriching lives,” wrote University President Drew G. Faust in a statement.
On a more personal note, Faust called the mayor not only a friend, but a mentor.
“I am personally grateful for his friendship, guidance, and advice,” she wrote. “ [I] regard myself as one of this extraordinary leader’s grateful students.”
Faust was joined by Harvard professors who pinpointed the mayor’s transformative education policies.
David Luberoff, a senior project advisor to the Radcliffe Institute’s Boston Area Research Initiative, called Menino a leader who was transformative in many areas and knew just how to approach his job. Luberoff wrote in an email to The Crimson that Menino not only knew how to cultivate good ideas, but also recognized “what it would take to actually put good ideas into action.”
This was particularly true when it came to education, Luberoff said.
“He was a skeptic on charter schools until he saw the results produced by good charter schools, which led him to successfully advocate for state legislation increasing the cap on charter schools in Boston,” he wrote.
Menino dedicated much of his Thursday speech Thursday to education.
Telling voters about how he was able to commit some much of the life of the city, Menino said, “I just did what I loved and then it wasn’t too hard.”
“You promise a computer for every classroom and then watch kids teach their grandmothers how to email,” he continued. “You partner with parents to keep politics out of the school committee and then you work with them to deliver quality schools closer to their homes. You read to children at dazzling new libraries in Mattapan and Brighton.”
Afterwards, Menino was even more direct about his passion for education.
“It’s the most important thing we can do in our society,” he said to the media after his announcement. “Educate [our] children, and they’ll have a bright future and they won’t turn to other issues.... We’re not perfect, but we made a lot of gains. We’ll still stay focused on education.”
As Menino serves out his term, which ends in early 2014, the first competitive campaign for mayor in decades will play out.
“Menino has represented a certain culture, a certain perspective: he’s a neighborhood guy,” said Marty Linsky, an adjunct lecturer at Harvard Kennedy School. “And the city has changed. What this election will do is give everybody a sense of what those changes are.”

Fourteen Harvard College students have been selected as the first group of Edmond J. Safra Undergraduate Fellows. The fellowship seeks to provide a community of undergraduates and faculty members who are interested in conducing interdisciplinary research with an “ethical dimension.”
The 14 undergraduates, the scope of whose projects ranges from bioethics to the environment, will participate in a series of interdisciplinary workshops designed to develop their competence in modes of inquiry that are critical to addressing the important moral issues in public life.
Led by government professor Eric A. Beerbohm, the workshops will bring both theory and practice to a range of topics that will stimulate debate and allow students to develop their own research and writing.
To foster cross-disciplinary connections, the students will also participate in activities such as meals with faculty and a mentorship program.
In addition, the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, which runs the fellowship, has revived the Lester Kissel Summer Grants in Practical Ethics, which will provide the undergraduate fellows with the opportunity to extend their research into the summer.
In a press release, Law School professor and director of the Center Lawrence Lessig said he was enthusiastic about meeting a goal in the Center’s long-term agenda.
“In recognizing the value of engaging young scholars at an early stage of their education, the Center has been eager to extend its activities in ways that encompass the Harvard undergraduate community,” Lessig said.
Oliver C. Wenner ’14. who is interested in the intersection of law and philosophy, said he was “very excited” to be named as one of the 14 undergraduate fellows.
“I started the research on military conscription in Israeli military last summer, and when I saw this opportunity on the Harvard Philosophy Department email list, I felt like it was a good way to refine the research,” Wenner said.
The rest of this year’s fellows are Sheyda M. Aboii ’14, Nisha A. Deolalikar ’14, Medha B. Gargeya ’14, Isabelle W. Glimcher ’13, Jirka Jelinek ’13, Adam B. Kern ’13, Jared Lopez ’14, David G. Miller ’14, Lily H. Ostrer ’14, Ketan Ramakrishnan ’13, Chloe E. Reichel ’15, William H. Ryan ’14, and Celestine E. Warren ’14.

After the U.S. Supreme Court heard the oral arguments for two landmark same-sex marriage cases this week, Harvard Law School professors predicted that the justices would not uphold the Defense of Marriage Act and were unlikely to make a sweeping decision concerning Proposition 8.
Lawyers argued before the court on United States v. Windsor, which addresses DOMA, the national law defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and Hollingsworth v. Perry, a case addressing the constitutionality of California’s ban on same-sex marriage.
In both cases, Law School professors predicted the outcomes primarily based on the questions asked by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
“Justice Kennedy, who everybody says is the swing vote, is usually pretty transparent about his views,” said Law School professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67. “In the DOMA case, he was very skeptical. I would be very surprised if the DOMA statute were upheld.”
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman agreed, pointing specifically to Kennedy’s response toward the debate on federal jurisdiction over the definition of marriage.
“Justice Kennedy clearly seemed to think there was a federalism problem,” Klarman said.
In the case addressing California’s Proposition 8, however, Law School professors predicted that the justices will decide the case based on its procedural integrity, not on the merit of the ban itself.
In doing so, the court would avoid setting a precedent for same-sex marriage on a state level.
“From Tuesday’s argument [regarding Proposition 8], it sure didn’t sound likely that you’re going to get a broad ruling in favor of same-sex marriage across the board,” said Klarman, who attended the oral argument as a guest of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, for whom he used to clerk.
Contrastingly, Tushnet predicted that the DOMA case would be decided based on the issues of federalism and the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.
“It didn’t have the feel of a case that would be decided on procedural grounds,” Tushnet said, referencing issues raised by Law School professor Vicki C. Jackson in an amicus brief filed in January.
In her amicus brief—which was requested by the Court—Jackson argued that the justices do not have the constitutional power to issue merit-based decisions on the DOMA case.
Tushnet said he believes that Jackson’s brief on the case will not ultimately affect the justices’ decision making process.
“I would be very surprised if they accepted her arguments, and I think she would be pretty surprised too,” he said.
Ultimately, Klarman said he was cautious about making definitive predictions from the oral arguments.
“I don’t think you can be confident that you know how the justices are going to vote,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A competition launched by a Harvard graduate is encouraging students of all disciplines to try their hands at developing a “hack” of their own.
Rabbit, a technology start-up based in San Francisco, launched the competition for Boston-area college students on Monday. The competition asks applicants to develop and implement an idea for a program called a “growth hack,” which would grow Rabbit’s user base in the 17- to 25-year-old demographic.
Rabbit is a Facebook application that facilitates uploading photos and videos to the social networking site.
The winner of the competition will receive a $2,500 scholarship for the upcoming fall semester, as well as a paid internship in Rabbit’s Silicon Valley office this summer. Rabbit will also continue to develop the winning growth hack.
Michael J. Temkin ’94, Rabbit’s chief strategy officer, said students from any academic background—not just computer science—are encouraged to enter the competition. Temkin said that the key to developing a growth hack is innovation, so students with interests in other subjects, such as marketing, could do well in the competition as well.
“We’re looking for people who have great ideas on how to build a community, and the ability to go execute those ideas as well,” Temkin said. “What’s fun about the contest is that it’s not just about the ideas—it’s about making things happen, which is key to success as a start-up.”
Stephanie L. Morgan, one of Rabbit’s four co-founders, added that the competition is “open to all kinds of minds and all kinds of people.”
“The core thing is just to be awesome and creative,” Morgan said.
Interested students must submit their growth strategies by April 5. A team of judges will then work with applicants on their submissions, which the students will execute on their own respective college campus on April 15 before the winners are awarded first, second, or third place.
The second-place finisher will win a $2,500 scholarship, while the third-place finisher receives $1,000.
Temkin said he hopes the competition will encourage students’ innovation.
“We’re really hoping that this will really inspire people to be as creative as possible,” Temkin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After the sudden death of longtime baseball coach Joe Walsh, the Harvard program was thrown into flux as the athletic department attempted to find a replacement for the man who led the Crimson for 17 years. Out of the search for a manager emerged Bill Decker, the former head coach at Trinity College.
Decker was one of the most successful coaches in Division III history with a career record of 529-231—a .696 winning percentage.
As Trinity’s coach, Decker had 20 winning seasons in 22 years. He joins a Crimson team that has not had a winning season since 2006, when it went 21-20-1.
“Coach Decker brings a lot of experience and a lot of success to this school,” co-captain Rob Wineski says. “He’s had a very positive impact on the team already this year, and I think that will only continue as the program moves forward.”
Under Decker’s leadership, Trinity won NESCAC championships in 2000, 2003, 2008, 2009, and 2012. His best year was in 2008, when the Bantams went 45-1 and won the NCAA Division III National Championship in addition to NESCAC and New England Regional titles.
The team’s .978 winning percentage marked an NCAA record in all sports and divisions for a season of equal or greater length.
Decker has received numerous awards, including New England Coach of the Year five times, NESCAC Coach of the Year four times, and the American Baseball Coaches Association Coach of the Year once.
During his tenure, Trinity sent eight players on to professional baseball.
One of his pitchers, Jonah Bayliss, became the first NESCAC player to appear in a Major League game in 10 years when he debuted for the Royals in 2005.
“Coach Decker was always a terrific motivator,” Bayliss says. “He built in me the tenacity to never give up no matter what the situation may be. He has the mentality that even if the bases are loaded and nobody is out, we’re still not going to let anybody score. Only then have we done our job right.”
Throughout his career, Decker has not only exuded influence on the baseball field, but has also contributed to the Athletic Department in other ways.
A former All-American football player at Ithaca College, he has spent time coaching football, and during the 1999-2000 season was Trinity’s interim head football coach while maintaining his baseball responsibilities.
Decker has also tried to expand his responsibilities beyond athletics by playing a role in how his players participate in their classes.
“He was always a coach that held you very accountable,” Bayliss says. “I can recall our first meeting of the year. The first thing he always addressed was that we had better get our butts to class and sit in the front row. He made sure that all of his players were accountable for their actions on and off the field and demanded nothing but the most from his players.”
Decker’s players describe him as a focused coach who is very approachable but still is always in control.
“He’s a very personable guy,” Wineski says. “He really cares about his players a lot and shows it often. He’s very down to earth. If you have a problem, you can always go and talk to him. He’s very open.”
Decker left a lot behind in Hartford. In addition to departing a team coming off a conference championship, he left his own son, Kyle, who is a sophomore on the team.
“At the end of the day, it was a family decision with my wife,” Decker says. “I left the family back home temporarily, including [Kyle], so it wasn’t an easy decision. Nonetheless, it was one that I said yes to, and we’re going to take this thing as far as we can go.”
The transition from such sustained success to a Harvard program in flux is a challenge that Decker says he welcomes. He has already exerted his presence on the program and has worked towards instilling a new attitude in the locker room.
“A lot of our time as pitchers is spent doing work, and we don’t really stand around at all,” freshman picher Sean Poppen says. “That’s what pitchers are ‘supposed’ to do, to just stand around and help out, but [with us] there are definitely goals in mind with everything we’re doing every day.”
Following Walsh’s death, Decker was forced to walk a thin line between encouraging continuity and enacting change within a program in a delicate situation.
“Something coach Decker’s done a great job of is recognizing that this is a program that’s been under coach Walsh for a long time,” co-captain Jordan Haviland says. “He’s not coming in trying to replace anything. He’s stressed from day one that we’re going to honor what’s been done here in the past [and] we’re going to build off it.”
Decker certainly has his work cut out for him, as he is dealing with a very young team and competition that is significantly tougher than what he encountered at Trinity. But the coach is not fazed by the prospect of stepping up to Division I baseball.
“Kids are kids, ballplayers are ballplayers, academic institutions are academic institutions,” Decker says. “There are some subtle differences, but the biggest difference for me and one of the reasons I chose to say yes is the fact that [the Ivy League] is not as restrictive as the league that I came from. [At Trinity], I wanted to be on the field, being able to play fall baseball and really invest time on the field, which I didn’t have.”
There are three seniors and ten freshmen on the Crimson squad. The makeup of the team has allowed the coaches to come in and create a new environment, largely from scratch, as they work towards a better future for the program.
“I think it’s been great,” freshman DJ Link says. “The staff is full of great coaches. It was a new slate for everyone and everyone had to go through it, even the older guys, but I feel like the coaches are doing a great job. They’re very personable people, and I think that everyone on the team is buying into their style of coaching.”
Decker’s selection as Harvard coach came together at a time uncommon in the baseball hiring process. Arriving on campus in October, Decker had to quickly assess what he was working with.
“The whole hiring process, due to the untimely death of Joe, happened very, very late,” Decker says. “So my expectations were to come in here and really just look and get a feel for what had happened.”
Harvard has started off the season with a 3-14 record, an improvement over last year’s 1-17 start—but still not up to Decker’s Trinity standards.
“When we get through this season, the 2013 season, we’ll have a true evaluation of where we are as a program,” Decker says. “Not only who we have after practicing and playing for a season but what we need to do to get this program back where it belongs.”
“We’ll get there,” he adds. “It’s going to take everybody, not just the baseball program or people in the athletic administration. It’s everybody. It’s me reaching out to try and make sure that we try to do the right thing for our program, like all the other programs are trying to do, to make Harvard a special place.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When freshmen Mitch Klug, DJ Link, and Sean Poppen formally committed to Harvard in the spring of 2012, they thought they had a pretty good idea of what they were getting into.
The Crimson’s beloved coach Joe Walsh, who had recruited them and the rest of their teammates, was coming back for his 18th season, and despite a 12-30 (8-12 Ivy) record in 2011-12, Harvard was bringing back seven of its top eight batters and the bulk of its rotation. There was reason for optimism in Cambridge.
But over the summer, Walsh, 58, passed away and was replaced by former Trinity coach Bill Decker.
“At first it was just shock; you don’t really know how to react,” Poppen says.
The fall saw several more losses for the team as eight upperclassmen left before the season opened on Mar. 1. Harvard was left with just three batters who had more than 90 at-bats the previous season and only three pitchers with more than 20 innings on the hill.
Suddenly, Klug, Link, Poppen, and the Crimson baseball program were left with a lot of uncertainty.
“I really can’t say I had any idea what my role was going to be,” Klug says. “Especially with the new coaching staff and all the circumstances, I’m not sure if any of us really knew.”
Through 18 non-conference games, Klug, Link, and Poppen have planted themselves firmly in the starting lineup at second base, catcher, and pitcher, respectively. Klug and Link trail only sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel in plate appearances. Poppen leads Harvard in innings pitched and has started three games, including a complete-game three-hitter against Houston Baptist.
“I think [the wins against Houston Baptist] showed that we’ve got a couple young kids that have grown up in a hurry,” Decker says. “Due to our current situation, those kids were forced into these larger roles, and that’s going to give them good experience.”
Though Walsh’s presence will be difficult to replace, the trio of freshmen have done a good job at helping the Crimson (3-15) forget about the lost production from the absent members of last year’s team. At this point last season, Harvard was 1-17, having lost the opening 17 games of the year.
The Crimson bounced back to avoid last place in the Red Rolfe division. But if Harvard is to improve upon last year’s Ivy League performance, it will need consistent production from the three rookies and the rest of their 10-man class.
With Link leading the team in RBIs (eight), Klug second on the team in runs (six), and Poppen boasting a team-best 3.92 ERA, it can be easy to forget that just a year ago they were all still in high school.
“From a physical standpoint, [the hardest thing] is that everyone is bigger and stronger [in college],” Link says. “Everyone playing college baseball was big at their high school. They were all one of ‘those guys.’”
Klug, Link, and Poppen certainly were “those guys” for their high schools in Missouri, New Jersey, and Virginia, respectively. Klug was all-state in football at wide receiver and led his St. Louis University High School baseball team to a No. 7 national ranking. Link was all-state at Seton Hall Prep and was recruited by defending Ivy League champion Cornell. Poppen topped them both by throwing a no-hitter in the Virginia state championship game his senior year.
But, as Link pointed out, the college ranks are full of players with comparable, if not better, resumes. At this level, the freshmen can no longer get by on talent alone.
“In high school, we were able to get away with pulling an outside pitch or bobbling a ground ball and still throwing a guy out at first, but at this level you can’t do that,” Klug says. “You have to focus on every play.”
At times, lapses of focus have cost the rookies and the Crimson. In addition to his spectacular outing against Houston Baptist, Poppen was victimized by Rice, giving up seven hits and nine runs in five innings in a 12-0 Harvard loss. Likewise, Link has had four multi-hit games this season, tied for tops on the team with Klug, but has also failed to get on base in five games, all Harvard losses.
“Everything feels really professional,” Poppen says. “Every day you go in and have to get your work done, and you get better by the end of every day. Last year, some of my friends went off to college to pitch and some of them were saying, ‘Yeah, a lot of what pitching is you pitch, you run, you field fly balls for guys batting, and there’s a lot of downtime,’ and I’m not getting a lot of that.”
Helping the freshmen adjust to the increased athletic workload, not to mention the academic one, is a group of upperclassmen that have welcomed the Class of 2016 from day one.
“The older guys on the team are great - we love ’em,” Link says. “They did a really good job assimilating the freshmen with them and making us feel [like we were] part of the team, and we appreciate that.”
Still, the large freshman class has its own identity, and a confidence that the best is still to come for Harvard baseball.
“I feel like the freshmen really stick together; it’s one team but the freshmen eat lunch together [and] dinner together all the time,” Link says. “We’re always in Annenberg together; there’s definitely camaraderie between all the freshmen. We know we’re a great team if we play fundamentally sound baseball. We just have to do it every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After helping the Harvard women’s softball team cruise to an 11-1 Ivy mark and a berth in the 2000 NCAA tournament, Crimson coach Jenny Allard was unsure how her 2001 team, a squad ripe with fresh and inexperienced talent, would perform.
“We were starting freshmen,” Allard says. “Everybody in the infield was a freshman pretty much that year.”
With ten rookies on the roster and the loss of major players like shortstop Deborah Abeles ’00, the 2000 Ivy Player of the Year, the season started with few guarantees.
But concerns were quickly answered. Allard led her team to a second straight Ancient Eight title with an 11-3 conference record.
“We had some preseason success and had a really good run,” Allard says. “I think that team overachieved and played above their talent.”
Twelve years later, Allard yet again has a young, inexperienced team this season.
“I think with a young team, the focus is gaining a lot of experience,” Allard says. “Physically, at any one point in time there are only two, three, [at most] four, players in the lineup who were in last year’s game.”
While her team is young, Allard herself does not lack experience. The coach, now in her 19th year with the Crimson, is the longest-serving coach in the Ivy League. As a player at the University of Michigan, she transitioned to pitcher to fill a vacancy during her junior year despite having previously started as a third baseman. She went on to be named Most Outstanding Pitcher by the team.
Discipline and routine prove key to Allard’s success with the game.
“The game’s the same,” Allard says. “The process is the same. You need your pitching, you need good defense, and you need timely hits. That formula is the same no matter whom you’re playing.”
After winning two straight Ivy League championships, this year’s team enters the Ivy season without five graduated seniors, including former starting pitcher Rachel Brown ’12, who was named Ivy League Pitcher of the Year last season.
With their departures, starting roles have been given to sophomores and freshmen.
“The second the seniors graduated, we knew that there were going to be spots open,” sophomore pitcher Gabrielle Ruiz says. “If you’re going to be the best one to fill that spot, you’re going to fill it.”
Ruiz and freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula have assumed key roles on the mound. The trio has seen the majority of playing time thus far this year.
“The freshmen have stepped up,” Ruiz says. “Coach [Allard] has been great—she treats us all the same. No matter who you are, if you’re the best, you’re going to play. That’s been the idea this year.”
Leadership has been a key factor in guiding younger players as they adjust to the college game. On a roster with few seniors starting, leadership on the field is in the hands of younger players.
For the first time since 2006, the team is captained by a junior, outfielder Shelbi Olson. Olson spent most of last season starting in right field.
In the infield, Allard points to junior Kasey Lange as a guiding light. Lange was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2011 and has been named to the first All-Ivy team for two years running at third base.
“We’re really trying to push Kasey to be a leader out on the field and really command the infield and help make decisions out there,” Allard says.
While the onus to win rests on her players, Allard views her own role as a coach as lying in a delicate equilibrium.
“With a team that has had less experience, you need to balance your expectations with their growth,” Allard says. “I think patience can be very key with that role. You don’t want to be too patient such that you allow them to continue to make a lot of mistakes ,but you don’t want to have so many expectations that they can’t meet them.”
The team battled at the beginning of the season, starting 5-9 in its three road-trip tournaments in March. Occasionally, the team’s performances in losses have disappointed Allard. On March 24, the team lost to Syracuse in the tenth inning when a wild pitch helped the Orange snag a 5-4 victory.
“Currently, we’re in a period of frustration because we should be playing better than we are,” Allard says. “We aren’t making necessary adjustments because we feel as a team that we haven’t had enough time to make those adjustments.”
Again, Allard looks to the past, back to that 2001 championship team.
“[In 2001] they really came together as a team and I think that’s the challenge where this team is—to play above where their talent is,” Allard said. “We haven’t done that yet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the world of collegiate sports, every year sees different players come and go, and the departures of seasoned veterans are always met by arrivals of young stars looking to make an impact in their time on the team. Some years, though, see more departures than others.
Last season’s Harvard softball team had one of its best seasons ever, led by one of the greatest performances by a Crimson pitcher in the school’s history. Co-captain Rachel Brown carried the team to the regional finals of NCAA Tournament, before it ultimately fell to 16-seed Washington.
During the regular season, Brown finished with a 2.17 ERA and placed fifth in the nation in strikeouts per seven innings with an average of 9.7.
Her play and the team’s bats pushed the Crimson further in the national tournament than any Harvard team since 1996. It was also the Crimson’s second straight Ivy championship.
Now, with the noticeable void left behind by Brown and fellow ace Laura Ricciardone, the rest of the squad will have to rebuild around a new collection of pitchers.
The team, however, is used to saying goodbye to key players and rebuilding around new teammates. The year before Brown joined the team, the program graduated Shelly Madick, the Ivy League Pitcher of the Year in 2007, and still went on to win the Ivy League title.
Now, it is looking to do the same with a pitching staff that is once again young and unseasoned.
“This year we have two freshman pitchers and one sophomore pitcher, so we are in the process of having them gain experience and allowing them to mature into seasoned college pitchers,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said via e-mail. “The cycle repeats, just like it did with Rachel. It’s always a challenge to keep the same level of success when you graduate a pitcher of Rachel’s caliber, but we must allow our pitching staff to develop in the same way that Rachel did during her four years.”
Allard actively recruited pitchers in preparation for the hole left by Brown, gaining freshmen Morgan Groom and Jamie Halula, who joined sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz to form a pitching trio.
“[Rachel leaving] has been a huge absence for sure, but it’s more that we’ve had to change up our strategy for this year,” Ruiz says. “We no longer have that one person we can rely on, so it’s definitely more of a joint effort. [The rest of the pitchers] are all different, so everyone contributes to that.”
Ruiz pitched briefly in two games during her freshman year, but used the opportunity to learn under Brown and Ricciardone. Groom and Halula came into the spring season with no college experience and started right off the bat.
“I knew when I got recruited here that [Brown] was the main pitcher, and that she was really, really good.” Groom says. “I knew that it was going to be the three of us as a trio that were going to have to replace her.”
So far teammates have positive things to say about the two newest additions to the pitching squad aiming to fill Brown’s shoes.
“They’re getting acclimated,” Ruiz says. “It’s a big thing to come in as a freshman and know you’re going to start, but they’re handling the pressure. It makes us a young staff, but it also means they’re learning well how to work together. The three of us can combine to pitch together.”
No one pitcher has solidified herself as the dominant ace, and as a result, all three players are being used regularly in games with roughly the same frequency. Groom leads all three with 50.0 IP, but Halula and Ruiz have pitched 42.2 and 32.1 innings, respectively. As a comparison, Brown and Ricciardone were on the mound for a combined 314 out of 339.1 innings last season.
“I think the three of us work well because we’re so different,” Ruiz says. “Both Jamie and Morgan have crazy rise balls, I’m left-handed, and all three of us throw at different speeds, which really throws the hitters off because they can’t immediately adjust to different speeds. So there’s something different about all of us. Our pitches are all different and move differently, so it’s very effective.”
The combination of pitchers has had mixed results for the Crimson. Though Harvard also adjusted to the loss of hitters Jane Alexander, Allison Scott, Whitney Shaw and Ashley Heritage, the Crimson’s record coming into conference play was flipped last season, sitting at 12-7 a year ago.
Though wins and losses cannot be isolated to the individual pitcher, some of the drop off must be attributed to the pitching change. So far this season, the team has a 3.77 earned run average, compared with a combined mark of 1.84 from last year.
But Harvard traditionally does better in conference play, as the level of competition is a step below what the Crimson faces in its non-conference opponents scattered across the country.
Pitching at home and playing familiar competition should lead to a rise in the pitchers’ production.
“We’re definitely taking it one step at a time, but there’s no reason that our team can’t compete and possibly even win Ivies again,” Ruiz says.
Another Ivy League championship would earn the team a three-peat, something no Ancient Eight program has accomplished since Princeton pulled off the feat in 1994-96. If Harvard is to match that Tigers squad, it will do so on the back of its young arms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From point guard Siyani Chambers’s All-Ivy success for the men’s basketball team to Jerry Chang helping the men’s fencing team to its seventh Ivy League title, there is no doubt that the Class of 2016 has had a huge impact on Harvard sports so far this year.
The theme of freshmen success appears poised to continue, as the softball team enters Ivy League play this week with several rookies playing key roles for the squad.
Of the 19 players listed on the Harvard roster, six are freshmen. Pitchers Jamie Halula and Morgan Groom, outfielder Zoe Galindo, catcher Rachel Halperin, and utility players Haley Davis and Alyssa Siegmann make up the class.
After graduating key players from last season, such as pitcher Rachel Brown and infielder Jane Alexander, the squad entered its non-conference schedule with plenty of unknowns.
Though the team went 7-12 in non-conference play, Harvard can point to the efforts of some of its freshmen as bright spots going into Ivy competition.
Galindo, Halula, and Groom all received significant playing time throughout the first part of the season and have responded well to the pressures of college softball.
“I think Zoe, Morgan, and Jamie have all done a great job of not playing like freshmen,” junior captain Shelbi Olson says. “When you start playing Division I softball and you haven’t played at that level before, it is obviously hard confidence-wise. I think they have done a really good job of going out there and playing like they know they are good players.”
Galindo has become a starting outfielder for the Crimson, posting a .290 batting average so far this season to go along with a .944 fielding percentage.
“Zoe has done a really good job of just focusing on her role,” Olson says. “She has taken the mentality of being the best player she can be and just focusing on her hitting and her fielding. She has gotten a lot of playing time because she has worked so hard and proved herself.”
Groom and Halula have pitched both as starters and relievers this season. The two freshman lead the team in innings pitched with 50 and 42.2, respectively.
Halula has started five games for Harvard and has appeared in relief in nine more. She is currently 2-3 on the year with a 4.59 ERA. Groom, meanwhile, has started seven games and worked in relief in five others. She is 3-5 on the year with 2.24 ERA.
“Jamie and Morgan have been absolutely killing it,” Galindo says. “They came into this season knowing they were going to have to step up and have a big impact as freshmen, and they have done a great job working on getting better every day and being a big part of the team effort.”
With two freshmen and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz as the main pitchers for the Crimson this season, players say coach Jenny Allard has emphasized the importance of a total-staff effort.
“The team has a mentality that all of the pitchers are important and that we are going to use them however we need to use them to get wins,” Olson says. “The entire pitching staff has really been focused on a team mentality and they all have gotten a lot of pitching time. It is really a mentality of always being ready to warm up and go in, and Morgan and Jamie have done a really good job adjusting to that and really making it work.”
The transition from high school to college can be difficult, juggling schoolwork, athletics, and time management. According to Olson, softball is no different, as freshmen must not only adjust to better competition on the field but also  to a more difficult balance of academics and sport.
“I think the biggest change for freshmen is learning the correct balance between school and softball,” Olson says. “We have all been athletes and have all been students throughout our lives, but coming to Harvard and combining both at the highest level is a very unique situation. As upperclassmen, we just try to make them feel more comfortable and explain to them how Harvard works.”
While the balance of playing softball for Harvard can be demanding, Galindo already believes the experience is well worth her time.
“I couldn’t imagine a bigger transition than the change from high school softball to college softball,” Galindo says. “When you are playing for a college it is such a more powerful experience than when you are playing for a high school. Playing for Harvard and against such good competition makes everything so much more rewarding.”
Though it may be easy to focus on individual performances and statistics, the team stresses the importance of playing as a unit and succeeding as a group.
“The team is so close and so strong and it is just a really tight unit,” Galindo says. “Our coach always says, ‘Play for the name on the front, not the number on the back [of your jersey],’ and I feel like we really take that to heart.”
Allard’s focus has clearly had an impact on the mentality of her players. Galindo is quick to credit much of her success so far this season to the support of both the team’s upperclassmen and her freshmen classmates.
“The veterans on our team and the coaching staff have helped our freshman unit to grow and improve,” Galindo says. “From our practices to our long workouts in the weight room, they have been so supportive and have shown such faith in us from day one.”
Though conditioning drills and practices started over seven months ago in September, the Crimson’s season started March 1 in Boca Raton, Fla. For many freshmen, the extra practice in the fall was important in their transition to the college level.
“[By starting in September] we have all those months of practice before we start playing,” Olson explains. “The freshmen have really worked hard since day one of practice, and they are always giving a 100-percent effort in working to get better. That hard work in practice has propelled them to where they are now, and they all have made a lot of improvements.”
The offseason practice schedule was especially useful for Groom and Halula as adjusting from high school to college hitters is a tall task.
“I think the most apparent change is the quality of batters,” Groom agrees. “To make a smooth transition takes a lot of focus and determination to get better during the off-season, physically and mentally. Guidance from the upperclassmen has definitely made it a lot easier.”
As Harvard looks towards its Ivy League schedule that begins against Penn on March 29, the team hopes its tough non-conference competition has prepared the freshmen for conference play.
“The [non-conference schedule] really showed us what we can do against big competition,” Galindo says. “While we may have lost some games, our coach explained that she challenges us for a reason and that it will prepare us for our conference games. We have worked so hard throughout the fall and preseason, and I think we are putting things together and really becoming a force.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With runners on first and third and two outs in the 10th inning of a tied game, senior infielder Rob Wineski stepped to the plate with the chance to earn a win in Harvard’s first baseball game of the year.
Wineski quickly fell behind in the count, 0-2, and it looked as if the game might be headed to an 11th inning.
But when the co-captain slapped the next offering up the middle for a base hit, and sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel scampered home from third, the Crimson opened its 2013 season with a victory over Bucknell in Charlottesville, Va.
Players bolted out of the Harvard dugout and mobbed Wineski, jumping up and down in pure joy. But, the scene was imperfect.
Absent was the man wearing No. 2 who had been present for moments like this for the last 17 years. His joyful personality, deep affection for others, and on the field presence were missing.
DREAM JOB
Since the unexpected death of coach Joe Walsh on July 31, something has been different about the Harvard baseball program. For years, whenever one thought of Harvard baseball, Walsh was the first thing to come to mind.
The head coach of the Crimson since 1996, Walsh was a fixture at games and practices for 17 years.
He could be found at camps for prospective players and clinics for elementary school kids.
If it had to do with Harvard baseball, you could count on Walsh being there.
“[The job] was everything to him,” says former Harvard recruiting coordinator Tom Lo Ricco, who worked alongside Walsh for eight years. “He absolutely loved it. He put his whole life into the job. Many times he was there late at night and slept in the office. It was just a big part of him.”
Wineski recalls a memory of Walsh after a tough weekend loss to Columbia. As Wineski was walking past O’Donnell Field three or four hours after the game, he saw Walsh still sitting in the dugout in silence.
“It was just his life,” Wineski says. “He lived and died every day on the baseball field. He had so much pride for that program…. I can’t begin to describe how much he loved baseball and how much he loved Harvard.”
Indeed, it seemed that Walsh was destined to end up as Harvard’s coach.
Born in West Roxbury, Mass., Walsh grew up in Boston and spent his entire life in the area. He attended Suffolk University after high school and played baseball for the Rams.
Just four years after his senior season at Suffolk, Walsh became the head coach at the university and collected 218 wins in 15 years at the helm before learning of an opening at Harvard.
In order to demonstrate his eagerness to be hired, Walsh woke up before sunrise, drove to Cambridge, and waited in the athletic complex for then-Harvard Athletic Director Bill Cleary to arrive.
In the early hours of the morning, Walsh did not just tell Cleary that he wanted the job—he showed him, firsthand, his passion and commitment.
“I think I’d say that it was his dream job,” says Kurt Svoboda, a close friend of Walsh and the former Assistant Director of Athletics for Communications at Harvard. “He was a Boston guy. He grew up there, he worked in the city for a number of years at Suffolk in a similar position. And the job came open, and I think for him to coach baseball at the highest level of Division I and to do it in his home city was frankly a dream of his.”
After being hired, Walsh attained considerable success at Harvard. In his 17 years of coaching Ivy League baseball, he racked up 347 wins for the Crimson.
Walsh amassed victories at multiple NCAA regional tournaments, and his Crimson squad bested schools such as UCLA, Tulane, and the University of Miami. In 1998, Walsh led Harvard to a record-breaking season, finishing with a 36-12 record and a No. 24 national ranking.
Twice named the Northeast Region Division I Coach of the Year, Walsh was inducted into the Suffolk Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009.
But, those who knew Walsh would ultimately remember him because of the person he was, how he lived his life, and what he stood for.
“The effect that he had on a broader base within the Harvard community, I think, was remarkable,” Svoboda says. “The wins and the losses, they come and go, but I really think some of the lessons he spoke of and provided to his players and the community are really what people take with them and will continue to remember.”
AN AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY
Those who knew Walsh remember the jovial, outgoing, and contagious personality that he carried with him.
“It’s tough to define someone you feel like you knew your whole life and who you could just tell stories [about] for hours,” former captain Andrew Ferreira says. “He’s someone you could really connect with and feel wanted in a program like Harvard.”
An avid conversationalist, Walsh was always eager to talk, both to hear what other people had to say and to share his own experiences.
“He always had a story,” Wineski says. “You could bring anything to him, and he would have some, you know, ‘When I was…back in my day.’ You got that thick Boston accent, and you could never stop smiling when you talked to Coach Walsh.”
Walsh was known for his classic Boston accent and his upbeat, animated mannerisms. When he got worked up about something, he became jumpy and exaggerated his gestures even further. As Svoboda puts it, this was Walsh “flying off the handle.”
Not afraid to be honest and tell people what he really thought, Walsh was a willing dispenser of experience and knowledge he had accumulated during his lifetime.
Often, these lessons revolved around the values he held dear and embodied in his daily life: working hard, appreciating others, and enjoying the present.
“[Walsh would say], ‘There’s plenty of time to be sitting in a concrete cave with your tie perfectly done up right to the top of your belt, prim and proper, making money. But this is baseball, this is what you’re here for, and just enjoy that moment.’” Svoboda recalls. “And it always put a huge smile on your face, because it’s absolutely right. We all have our own issues going on in our day-to-day lives, but when you’re here, appreciate that you can be playing baseball with people who you’re going to be lifelong friends with.”
RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT TRULY MATTER
Part of what made Walsh unique and charming to many was his appreciation for people—not texts, emails, or phone conversations on his flip cell—but everyday talks with real people.
These interactions held true meaning for Walsh, provided him with genuine enjoyment, and brightened the day of anyone he interacted with.
“To me, the one thing that always sticks out most is, whenever anyone ever came up to him and said, ‘Hey, Joe, how are you?’ he would say, ‘I’m fine, but more importantly, how are you,’” Lo Ricco says. “That’s the one thing he always said. I think he always valued other people more than himself…. He was the definition of a people’s person.”
One of Lo Ricco’s favorite stories about Walsh started with a normal day at the office. Walsh received a phone call that turned out to be a wrong number. At this point, any other person might have hung up and moved on with their day.
But Walsh spent the next five minutes attempting to help the caller and put him in touch with the right person.
Svoboda recalls a number of times when Walsh asked about him and his family. Walsh’s curiosity was not just our of politeness but was rooted in a legitimate interest in the lives of others.
“He took a remarkable interest in my family and my son,” Svoboda says. “It wasn’t just, ‘Hey, how’s the little guy doing?’ He genuinely cared about people.”
Walsh loved people more than anything else. Those who met him would experience the genuine care for others.
“All along, we thought that baseball was the love of his life, but it was really his family, his wife and his four daughters,” says Morgan Brown ’06, who served as a player and an assistant coach within the baseball program. “They meant the world to him, and he was extraordinarily proud of them…. But you would have thought that you were a part of his family, as a player or a coach. He was that sort of person.”
The reverberations of Walsh’s outgoing nature were widespread. Over the course of his life, Walsh had a tangible impact on many people, who both loved his personality and appreciated his fundamental desire to be around people.
Perhaps the place that demonstrated Walsh’s influence was his funeral.
“I’ll never forget driving from the funeral to the burial,” Svoboda says. “It completely shut down Route 93 South. I remember looking back…at just a single line of cars on the highway as far as the eye could see, in front of me, going off the exit, and then behind me into Boston. It really hit me, the impact that he had on people.”
A PLAYER’S COACH
Although his personality extended to influence people who had nothing to do with his job, the group that experienced a more significant impact was the Harvard baseball team itself.
Walsh’s players were around him for a great deal of time in the spring season, and they came to view him as a role model.
“He was always there for you, no matter what,” Wineski says. “He gave me some of the best advice I’ve ever gotten in my life, and you kind of looked up to him as a father figure when you were here at school.”
Brown came to Harvard from a small high school in New Hampshire. Imbued with a love for baseball, Brown tried out for the squad and made it.
In his own words, Brown was the 26th man on a 26-player roster. But Walsh saw something special in the freshman. Brown entered Harvard thinking he might be lucky to play club baseball, but he became a three-year starter at shortstop, a captain, and an All-American.
Brown returned to Harvard and has served as a volunteer assistant coach for the past two years.
“I had an extraordinarily rewarding experience that I otherwise wouldn’t have had if he hadn’t given me a chance,” Brown says. “He supported me the whole time.”
Often, people decide to attend Harvard because of its renowned academics and its vibrant, diverse community. But one of the main aspects that drew baseball players to the school over the past 17 years was the presence of Walsh himself.
“The first time I met Coach Walsh, I wanted to go to Harvard,” Ferreira says. “He pitched me on Harvard, and he didn’t do it intentionally, but he sold me on him. I just fell in love with the man right away. He was just so engaging.”
Ferreira, who currently plays within the Minnesota Twins organization, remembers how his coach instilled in him a passion for baseball.
“He just had an authentic love for the game that he taught his players,” Ferreira says. “The Ivy League has a stigma in professional baseball that the guys play for one or two years, then they’re going to quit and go work on Wall Street. But all the Harvard guys I know in professional baseball now, they all love the game, and I think that’s something Coach Walsh fostered in each of us.”
To outsiders looking in, Walsh and Harvard baseball were one—Walsh was not just the head coach but the heart and soul of the program as well. Walsh made a concerted effort to ensure that his prospective players embodied the values he stood for.
The players Walsh recruited shared certain traits: a passion for the game and a strong character. For Walsh, the deciding factor for a recruit was often whether or not the player sent him a handwritten note, as opposed to a strict evaluation of his high school stats.
One of the fields on the questionnaire that all recruits filled out was the employment information of his parents. Not satisfied with a perfunctory profile, Walsh also wanted to understand the circumstances in which his player had been raised to achieve a better appreciation of the player’s makeup.
“He recruited a certain type of guy, and that guy loved baseball, was a baseball purist, and brought that same passion everywhere in life,” co-captain and pitcher Jordan Haviland says. “Once you were one of his guys, you were one of his guys for life. He looked out for you in every way he could.”
A NEW ERA, BUT THE OLD LIVES ON
This season, for the first time in 17 years, what seemed to be a fixture in the Harvard baseball program is no longer so. Coach Walsh cannot be found in the dugout.
But the influence of No. 2 lives on with the Crimson and is even felt by the freshmen.
“Coach Walsh is still around in everyone’s hearts and everyone’s minds,” freshman catcher DJ Link says. “He’s still there, and that’s how it’s going to be for a long time to come. I think the fact that so many people were affected speaks to him as a person and shows how much of an impact he had on so many people’s lives.”
Freshmen make up a large portion of this year’s roster, and though they did not know Walsh as well as the rest of the team, older players are making sure they understand that Walsh is still a part of the squad.
“Every once in a while, someone will do their Coach Walsh impersonation with the accent or some of the sayings that he had,” freshman pitcher Sean Poppen says. “The passion is still there; that passion is still on the team. It’s just coming from a different source now.”
Coach Bill Decker, who previously coached at Trinity College, has assumed the helm of the program.
“There is a strong tradition of baseball at this university, and that’s very important to me,” Decker says. “In Joe’s 17 years, Joe was a big part of that history…. We certainly wanted to honor the feelings of not only the current but also the former players in terms of their relationships with Joe and what he stood for and what he brought to the program.”
Indeed, Walsh’s values are central to the team’s conception of its identity. His energetic and compassionate character—what other people will remember most—have not, and likely will not, die out.
“Something Coach Walsh used to always say is he wanted us to play like bulldogs, which is play tough, play with intensity, and play with passion,” Haviland says. “And that’s something that’s still thrown around the team, is go out there and be a bulldog, just like Coach Walsh wanted us.”
***
There is no denying that something was missing on that first day of March, the day when Harvard played its first game of the year and notched its first win.
It seems fitting that it was Wineski, someone who shared his first three years of college with Walsh, who came up with the game-winning hit—a scrappy, two-strike chopper back up the middle—just how Walsh liked it best.
For some of the players, the game seemed to usher in new era for the program—an era laced with elements of the old as well as the new.
“It was definitely a little emotional for us seniors,” pitcher Matt Doyle says. “It was the first time No. 2 wasn’t in the third base box…. After the game, we grabbed the game ball and gave it to Coach Decker and we go, ‘This is the first of many.’ Just knowing with the 2 on our jerseys that we’re not forgetting about what happened in the past, but we’re ready to move forward with the next 20 years of Harvard baseball.”
It may be a new season, there may be a new coach, and there may be new players on the roster. But one constant that will likely never leave the team is the influence of Joe Walsh.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
March 27, 1918: To Sing at Charity Concert in New York
By reversing its decision of several weeks ago the Faculty yesterday afternoon granted permission to the University Musical Clubs to participate in a joint war-charity concert with Yale and Princeton at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City, on Saturday evening, April 13. Members of the clubs will leave Cambridge at 1 o'clock on the above date and will disband for the vacation that night, after the concert.
This entertainment will be an innovation, as it will be the first time that the Glee and Instrumental Clubs of Yale, Princeton and the University have played in a joint concert. Furthermore, the performance will take the place of the annual Intercollegiate Glee Club Meet, which was abandoned this year on account of the war.
March 25, 1930: 1200 Votes Cast on First Day of Prohibition Poll
Although over 1200 ballots were cast yesterday on the first day of The Crimson's prohibition poll, it is expected that more than twice as many ballots will be cast today, when polling is extended to cover the Law, Business, Medical, and Engineering Schools.
Final results will not be made public until Thursday morning, when announcement will be made not only of prohibition sentiment at Harvard but also of the results of straw votes now being held at fourteen other colleges throughout the East, South, and Middle West.
March 26, 1940: Summer School 'Contracts' Void if America Enters War
Teaching "contracts" for the coming session of the Summer School are not binding in the event that the United States should become involved in the European conflict, it was revealed yesterday.
According to Kirtley F. Mather, professor of Geology and Director of the Summer School, the contracts "which are merely formal letters" contain an escape clause providing for the "contingency of the United States' participation in the European war."
"The agreements were made out last September at the time of the outbreak of the fighting, and it was realized that if we should enter the war, a complete change of the Summer School program would be necessary. There is now not a chance in the world that this will come about," Mather asserted.
March 24, 1964: Big 'Cliffe Dance Snows the Fans
A good time was had by all at the South House Master's Ball Saturday night, a situation well nigh unprecedented at Radcliffe College.
"It's going to be elegant, dammit," promised the organizers a month ago, and it was nothing if not elegant. All the girls wore floor-length dresses, the floors of Agassiz ballroom were polished up to a high sheen, and even the janitor had on a black tie (with his dark suit).
Estimates of the number of people attending ranged from 100 to 300. They all reportedly enjoyed themselves, "because they knew just what to expect." But every other dance was a Viennese waltz, noted a little Barnard girl, "which is kind of unfortunate if your date doesn't know how to waltz."
March 24, 1977: Disabled Students at Harvard
To most of those in Humanities 9b, "Oral and Popular Literature," it made little difference when the class moved from Burr Hall to larger quarters in Sanders Theatre. For one student in the class, however, the relocation created a serious problem. Stephanie Thomas '80 could maneuver her wheelchair into Burr, but not into Memorial Hall.
The predicament was short-lived, as the Department of Buildings and Grounds installed a temporary ramp onto Memorial Hall. Yet the situation typifies those problems which physically disabled Harvard students face. Many academic, housing, recreational and athletic facilities are inaccessible to those in wheelchairs; blind students have trouble obtaining reading material for courses; and deaf students must use interpreters at lectures.

Welcome to "Listen Up!," Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop.
We rounded up some of your most poignant questions from the last few weeks and responded with our unfailing wisdom.
Q: I'm interested in a senior. Too late to do anything about it?
 
A: Is that senior one of us? Are you over 5'10"? Then it's never too late.
 
Regardless, you still have two whole months to lay some smooth moves on this senior. Let's be real: when was the last time you had a hook up/relationship that lasted much longer anyway? And if you do happen to find your soulmate in the Class of 2013, we have some good news: just because we are graduating doesn't mean we are disappearing, dying, or agreeing to arranged marriages.
 
Graduation is not some sort of expiration stamp on all relationship (or even kind-of-relationship) potential with people here. In fact, based on our research, most successful Harvard couples began dating long after graduation, once they gained some perspective, humility, and real world skills. Like actually asking people on dates.
 
Q: Dear Listen Up:
 
I keep losing my jacket when I party in the basement of the Owl. This has happened four times now. What should I do? I can't keep losing my jackets like this. It's becoming a really expensive habit.
xoxo,
#jacketless
 
A: Okay, biddies, listen up. Every January, every winter coat on the face of the planet goes on sale. Like, super on sale. This is the time to purchase your Going Out Coat, not to be confused with your North Face Fleece or your Is There Seriously Another Blizzard Why Did I Go To School In Boston Coat. Go to one of these sales. Spend less than fifty dollars on a coat that IS NOT BLACK. Make sure it's not too ugly to be seen in but just ugly enough that no one in her right mind would steal it.
 
 If you lose it, it wasn't expensive. But guess what? You won't lose it because it will be easy to spot your orange parka in the giant mountains of black coats that inevitably build up in various basements around campus.
 
Just remember, even if you forget your coat, try to leave with your dignity.
 
Q: I'm a junior, and we are starting to figure out housing for next year. I have been living with the same person since freshman year, but things haven't been going well with us recently and I really don't want to have to live together next year. The problem is that I know she will freak out if I even bring this up. Any advice on how to deal with this?
 
A. You have a couple of options here. Non-confrontational ones include transferring schools, taking a semester off, paying someone else to approach her about living together, or going abroad for the fall. We hear Paris is lovely that time of year.
 
Otherwise, you're going to have to talk to your roommate. This is essentially like a breakup and the same rules apply: do it in person, and be clear, calm, and concise. Then find somewhere else to crash for the rest of the semester and pray to God you don’t run into your ex while you’re buying mini Reese's and a bottle of wine alone on a Tuesday night at C'est Bon. Not that that's ever happened to either of us.
 
You might make her angry by telling her you don’t want to live with her, but you will do more harm to your friendship if you don't say anything and then resent her for an entire year. Especially for your last year, it's important to surround yourself with people who will help maintain your sanity, not destroy it. If we didn't have this particular futon in this particular tiny Winthrop suite and each other to come home to, we would have lost our minds on a more substantial level long ago.
