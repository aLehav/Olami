After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Sentences and Rain,” American poet Elaine Equi’s latest collection, is, at 88 pages, home to nearly that many poems: some 70-odd cerebral delicacies. In these poems, Equi tackles just as numerous a diversity of subjects. From a delivery truck to a George Harrison song to a friend’s library to a discussion of the function of diminutive suffixes, she turns her incisiveness and eye for wry observation onto an array of varied topics. “Sentences and Rain” is, on the whole, delightfully witty and playful, beautifully and finely composed, and formally experimental and inventive. The poems are short and sweet, with quick, nimble lines and sharp discrete visual snapshots.
The title of the collection is also an apt description of Equi’s style: Her poems are frequently composed of long sentences that, divided by line breaks, drip and drizzle down the page, forming little droplets of imagery. Her writing is both fluid and agile; there’s a free-flowing quality to it but also a sense of composed wit. As she puts it in the titular poem, “The sentences / previously / too dry / now bend / and reach / towards meaning.”
Equi’s collection is an unabashed celebration of the pleasures of language. Her poems play with wit and puns, unexpected lingual connections between seemingly dissimilar entities, and amusing insights into the workings of language. Some poems draw on everyday experiences, but remake them in . An especially funny highlight is a romp entitled “Cardboard Figures in a Landscape,” which takes as its subject “a truck / full of boxes…getting jostled, / sliding around / on top of each other” and leads exactly where one would expect: “sex between boxes.” Others feature incisive observations of contemporary life. In “Games of Medieval Sadness” she writes, “[There is] a dungeon / with my name on it. / When I wish to be chastised, / I need only log in.” Others are far more abstract in subject matter, the most notable of which include “In Black and White,” an evocative, sensual celebration of that color scheme, and “Ode to Distraction,” a darkly funny and acutely insightful exploration of inattention which opens, “Give me something / not to pay attention to / and I’m happy.” While some of her poems address the subject of language directly—including “If I Have Just One Word,” on the variety and power of language, and “Yo y Tu,” a beautiful, intimate meditation on the significance of the informal you in Spanish and lack thereof in English—all of her poems are marked by the serious delight she seems to take in language.
In the collection, Equi writes about language both explicitly—she is one of few who can make discussions of grammatical forms captivating and beautiful—and implicitly, as many of her poems seem to stem from little language games and experiments. The collection includes, among others, poems that only contain words spelled with certain letters, poems composed of artfully arranged lists of titles, poems entirely made up of lines borrowed from other poets’ poems, and a three-part poem inspired by words played in a game of Scrabble. Of these poems, one particular delight is “Literary Lipsticks,” which simply lists titles of and lines from other poems that could double as lipstick colors, such as “I Have Eaten the Plums” and “Frost at Midnight.” Another is the aforementioned Scrabble poem, “Scrabble with the Illuminati,” one section of which goes: “Owner / axes / plans / for / banal / lemon / ants / advent / event.” Not all of these more experimental poems are as whimsical or as light. In “A Medium-Rare Serenade,” an epithalamium poem dedicated to Equi’s niece and nephew-in-law, she only uses words that are spelled from the letters in their names. In this way, Equi tries to tease out the couple’s future—the poem is full of hopes and predictions for the couple as well as little pieces of wisdom and advice. It is an exquisite, moving poem, a triumph of experimental form.
What keeps this playful innovativeness from devolving into mere experimentation for experimentation’s sake is that Equi takes her play and her poetry seriously, hitching her humor and wit to beauty and insight. She is a poet of an incredible dynamic range, and her poems range from lighthearted to serious, sometimes several modes being activated in a single poem. This range and variety seems central to Equi’s poetic vision. In a poem entitled “Zukofsky Revision,” which references Louis Zukofsky, one of the founders of the 1930s school of Objectivist poetry, she updates his formulation of poetry as an “An integral / Lower limit speech / Upper limit music” with what she calls her “corollary”—“Upper limit thought / Lower limit noise.” Clearly, to Equi poetry is something integrative, in multiple senses of the word. Interestingly, she reverses Zukofsky’s syntactical structure, as if to emphasize a sort of opposite parallelism. She reformulates his “upper limit” music as her “lower limit” noise, and his “lower limit” speech as her “upper limit” thought. If to Zukofksy poetry can be conceived of as a sum total of all the little variations of expression from speech to music, to Equi poetry is that sum over the range from noise to thought. “Noise” references the purely sonic properties of language. “Thought,” on the other hand, implies meaning and ideas conveyed. This is where noise is the statistical scatter, compared to thought or premeditated intent.
To Equi, poetry encompasses everything imaginable in the physical universe. It leaps from pure sound to pure thought, from the seemingly random scatter of the world to the most thought out, internally composed verse. From reading Equi’s powerful, beautiful poetry, it is clear that her definition holds true.

In any dialogue, there exist forces in opposition. “References to Salvador Dali Make Me Hot,” which runs Oct. 16-Oct.24 on the Loeb Mainstage, aims to demonstrate forces bending and breaking in pairs: coyote and housecat; moon and memory; teenage boy and wild fantasy; war and manhood. Through all these potentially confusing, conflicting fragments, “References” hopes to imbue complex real-world questions of love and loneliness with otherworldly elements of magic realism.
This production of “References” is a new, unpublished adaption of Rivera’s original play by the author himself. The play tells the story of Benito (Eli K. Rivas ’16) and Gabriela (Juliana N. Sass ’17), a married couple newly reunited after Benito’s deployment in the Persian Gulf War. The new script leaves the central characters in place but puts a twist on other aspects of the play. The adapted version has never before been produced; visiting director Kat Yen cites the chance to bring the work to life as a special moment. “It's such an honor and rare opportunity to get to direct a new draft of a play that I've been in love with since college,” Yen says. Yen is also confident in the show’s appeal—especially to college students who, like Gabriela and Benito, are in a transitional stage. “I feel like the play is very relatable - growing up and deciding what parts of you and people/things around you [that] you want to keep and which ones you've outgrown,” Yen says.
Rivas agrees; although he does not personally identify with the “machismo” actions of Benito—an army man filled with (too much) pride and (perhaps too much) love—he does feel that other parts of his role will be relatable. “Whether or not you've experienced love, I think it's a topic that many Harvard students can connect to, and I hope that the way it's explored in the show will really affect people in unexpected ways,” Rivas says. Sass also sees the show as pertinent to deeper, universal human experiences. “This show is relevant to Harvard students (and to all human beings) because it's a meditation on what it means to be lonely, what it means to be in love, and the desperate desire to interact with the things we can't understand,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the beginning of this semester, I wrote an op-ed entitled “Dear Andy,” with the goal of honoring my friend and finally putting my long, complicated journey with mental health into words. Now, I am writing with a bigger goal in mind: I hope that we, as a country poised to enter yet another divisive election cycle, can come to agree that regardless of who we elect, our leaders must focus on national mental health reform.
It is time. Those of us with the power to enact change in our society must use our privilege to speak out for those among us with no voice. Our policy makers and national leaders must use their authority to develop strategies to fix our nation’s current mental health crisis. They—we—I have seen too many friends and family members struggle with mental illness, and their families and communities suffer with them.
As is the case with many of us, I have my own family story of despair and destruction. I have battled depression for as long as I can remember—and I am not the first in my family, or the first one of my friends, to do so.
My maternal grandmother was crippled by her undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and as a result, she was unable to live a normal life. Because of the stigma and ignorance surrounding mental health, she did not get help until she was 55 years old, when my mom finally appealed to the state to get medical power of attorney. This process irreparably marred their relationship. And it took decades for my grandmother to get the aid she needed to reconnect with reality—only to find that most of her life had already been wasted. She died a decade and a half later, at age 69. She barely even lived at all.
My high school class graduated without three of my best friends from childhood. Two of them, before they turned 14, experienced the death of their fathers. The other one saw his entire world crumble and fall apart, as his parents lost their house, their car, and their faith in God when the 2008 mortgage crisis devastated our North Georgia town.
My friends, when they were just children, lost everything. Due to a lack of knowledge, acceptance, and support, they coped with these hardships the only way that they knew how: All three became addicted to drugs, all three got into legal trouble, and all three dropped out. Because of their early trauma—and our society’s refusal to acknowledge the importance of mental health—my friends lost their childhood and lost their way.
I am tired of seeing my friends kill themselves when they could have gotten support. I am tired of my friends losing themselves to depression and drug addiction when they could have gotten therapy. I am tired of knowing my friends are only a few among thousands—no, millions—of American children who have experienced trauma that no one should ever endure, and who do not know how to ask for help.
Mental illness is a national epidemic, and remaining silent about it will not make it go away. Even if you are not like me, and have never personally suffered from severe mental health problems, you know at least one person who has. Maybe she committed suicide, maybe he became addicted to drugs, maybe she sat on the couch all day, every day, trying to drown her anguish with the steady drone of the television set. Maybe he was gunned down by someone who couldn’t or wouldn’t get mental health treatment.
This movement for national mental health reform is about the Americans who fall through the cracks. This movement is about the folks we neglect, about those we allow to fade away. This is about a stigma that is so strong that I, despite devoting myself fully to the cause of mental health reform, am still unable to motivate myself to get therapy for my depression. This is about our shared pain and our common need for change.
Mental illness affects all of us in some way. Now, in this upcoming election cycle, we as an American people must stand up to our former, lesser selves and say, “No more.”
No more drowning our sorrows in beer and vodka because, despite the splitting pain in our livers, alcohol is still a cheaper and less stigmatized comfort than mental health services. No more remaining silent as millions of Americans with mental illnesses are refused access to timely, affordable treatment. No more passively watching as our politicians refuse to address the fact that the largest government source of mental health treatment is the American penal system. No more remaining silent as our brothers and sisters sit dazed, alone, on the sidewalk or in a prison cell, with no way to get help. No more listening to politicians drone on and on about the horrors confronting America when they can’t admit their own failure to address the horrors haunting the minds of people we love.
No more silence. No more waiting. Just awareness. Then discussion. And finally, action.
Now is the time. National mental health reform starts with our generation, it starts with us, and it starts right now. So let’s start talking.

Bacardi and Smirnoff advertisements may be coming soon to a T stop near you. After three years, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is considering reversing its policy that currently bans alcohol ads in its trains and stations.
While advocates argue that alcohol advertisements represent a possible source of untapped revenue for the deficit-ridden MBTA, however, the economic gains are not worth the public health consequences of the advertisements. The MBTA system is regularly used by college students and high school students. Given the public health risks posed by underage drinking and the very real effect that alcohol advertisements have on young people’s alcohol consumption, this change would be a move in the wrong direction.
Of course, the MBTA’s budget deficit of $242 million is a sign that it should be considering all possible sources of revenue to ensure that it can improve its operations. However, the reversal of the alcohol ban is expected to add only $1.3 million to existing revenue—a number too insignificant to compensate for the social effects of the ads.
Allowing alcohol advertisements on a public transportation system so often used by students of all ages will only serve to encourage underage drinking. Alcohol abuse is already a serious problem at colleges, where unhealthy drinking behavior is prevalent. Alcohol advertisements on the T, to which Boston-area students are regularly exposed, will further exacerbate these problems. Moreover, studies have shown that high school students are more likely to drink when exposed to advertising, and that youth of color are often more likely to be exposed to alcohol advertisements in public locations.
Concerns about the influence of alcohol ads on young people are the very ones that prompted the MBTA to ban alcohol advertisements in 2012, following pressure from the Allston-Brighton Substance Abuse Task Force and young people themselves. Following the 2012 ban, the MBTA’s ad revenue dropped by $1 million, but has since rebounded robustly, increasing from $11 million in 2012 to $16 million in 2014. This upward trend shows that a solution to the MBTA’s financial problems does not necessarily include permitting alcohol advertisements.
With its potential to exacerbate serious public health issues and its limited financial benefits, the plan to lift the alcohol ban is ill conceived. We urge the MBTA instead to explore other the many other sources of revenue proposed by its advertising contractor. Every resident of the Greater Boston area—especially high school and college students—has a vested interest in ensuring that the T remains well maintained and operational all year round. But the public health consequences of represent an equally grave concern. In this case, the T should realize that alcohol advertising is not the appropriate solution to its fiscal constraints.

The sky cried for several hours on the night of May 23, 2009. Surely this is a self-centered way of describing things, because in South Korea, where former president Roh Moo-Hyun had just committed suicide, it was morning and the weather was okay. But all of the details of that night—the way that the Korean radio blared on about the cliff and his suicide note, my parents’ disbelief, and the consoling “tap tap tap” of the rain on the window—hold so much more significance in retrospect. I did not know at that time that the person who had passed away would be my political idol.
Ever since that rainy night, Roh has become an obsession of sorts for me. Perhaps it is because he was the person who made my mother an excited and independent political actor in my eyes. For a girl who usually can’t remember anything, I hold an incredibly crisp memory of my mother declaring her intention to support Roh in 2002, against the conservative political tendencies of my father and her sisters. On slow nights, I often browse through old YouTube clips of Roh’s speeches and documentaries that have been produced since his death. I tear up when I replay inspirational moments from his speeches, and I laugh at viral videos that stitch his words together into satirical rap songs. To date, I have written over 70 pages of academic work on his election and his presidential tenure.
It would be inaccurate to say that I admire Roh for his political achievements. Even as a citizen of another country on the outside looking in, I know that his administration was largely seen as a failure to realize his idealistic campaign promises. Because he refused to make compromises for Korea’s deep-rooted establishment circles (the chaebol conglomerates, the prosecutors, the three main newspapers, etc.), he lacked the political backing that many before him had taken for granted. When he soundly finished his term in spite of the numerous impeachment campaigns that had been waged against him, he was hit by a prosecution campaign that vigorously sought to confirm his corruption charges. Regretting that he had “disappointed the people” he jumped to his death at the peak of this prosecution campaign.
Roh was an outsider to these elite circles to begin with. He grew up poor in a Busan village where even “the crows turn away because there is nothing to eat.” Given that he had almost foregone middle school because his parents could not afford the tuition, college was not even in question. Roh passed the national bar exam through self-study and later became a human rights lawyer who defended student protesters accused of being pro-communist. His foray into politics came in response to his rising profile in the Korean liberal circles. At the age of 55, he was elected president under his promise to work toward a “world in which human beings live.” “The Attorney,” a critically-acclaimed Korean movie, nostalgically reflects on the life of the self-made man.
So perhaps it was the general satisfaction of rooting for an underdog that campaigned and won against a top dog. Or perhaps my admiration for him comes as an apology for the fact that the public that had voted to elect him actually had not been ready or powerful enough to pick him up when he was pushed to the ground by the establishment. Either way, the way that I think about Roh’s legacy closely parallels the excitement that I feel (and many of my peers feel) about the rise of Bernie Sanders, America’s current icon of idealism. To me, this is both exciting and scary.
Our campus these days is a sea of “BERNIE” laptop stickers. The night of the debate, #feelthebern was the most prominent hashtag on my Facebook and Twitter feeds. This is exciting because it gives me hope that once again, an underdog like Bernie Sanders—disheveled hair, no necktie, no big backers, regarded as a long shot—could finish ahead of the top dogs. But because he could win, it’s also scary. Are we as a nation ready to protect a president who is brave enough to put “people before corporations” without ultimately bowing out and saying that he isn’t savvy enough to play the political game? Back home in New York City, I see this sense of disillusionment being waged against Mayor Bill de Blasio, who rose to his current office in a wave of post-Bloomberg liberal sentiment.
On May 29, 2009, six days after Roh’s death, over 500,000 people gathered for his public funeral in the plaza of Seoul’s City Hall. The short sound bites and videos from the afternoon give a good sense of the mood of the event: wails, shouts of anger against the prosecutors, and tearful words of regret. The duty of idealism’s supporter in any presidential election extends beyond achieving the sweetness of election victory. For those of us who are excited by Bernie Sanders’s rising profile as we edge into 2016, we must acknowledge that we have the extra homework of staying proactive and engaged as political participants even after the election. That is the way that we will avoid having to say a decade later: “We’re sorry we weren’t able to protect you.”

The Republicans in the United States House of Representatives are very fortunate that a Presidential election is right now distracting the American public from their utter disarray. To recap, these legislators are the ones who went before the American electorate three times after the election of President Obama—in 2010, 2012, and 2014—and argued that, if given control of Congress, they would preside over a more responsible government, or at the very least present a coherent alternative vision to which the president and his party would have to respond. Just a year after their colleagues finally won control of Senate, the House GOP is now engaged in a bizarre spectacle of political cannibalism, having driven out both a Speaker and his heir apparent over a supposed lack of conservative credentials.
That John Boehner was deemed not conservative enough for the caucus is surprising to say the least. In a 24-year career, his legislative rating from the American Conservative Union has only once dropped below 85 percent, and for last year was 94.3. For today’s Freedom Caucus and the growing GOP right-flank, however, Boehner’s record was simply not good enough.
If Boehner’s unexpected departure was the tragic consequence of a Republican Party at war with itself, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s quick decision to withdraw from the Speaker’s race was a farcical repetition of the kind of leadership woes that have plagued Congressional Republicans since the 1990s. Of course, the faux pas that immediately precipitated McCarthy’s withdrawal was his moment of honesty about the true purpose of the hearings on the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi—to inflict political damage on Hillary Clinton. Even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi flagged such political ill-discipline as immediately disqualifying. Moreover, McCarthy also suffered from the same accusations of insufficiently conservative values.
But soon after McCarthy exited stage center-right came the rumors that he and Representative Renee Elmers of North Carolina had been having an affair. Both strongly deny these rumors, which may very well be the product of a smear campaign, as Elmers has said. Even so, House Republicans must have had an eerie sense of déjà vu at even the thought of such indiscretions.
Republican Speakers and Speakers-designate have something of a history with these issues. We now know with certainty that former Speaker Newt Gingrich was having an extramarital affair while he was overseeing the impeachment of President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In the aftermath of Gingrich’s resignation due to Republican losses in the 1998 midterms, his heir apparent, Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, also resigned. The reason: extramarital affairs.
This odd phenomenon leads me to a proposal: that we suspend the first amendment for long enough to ban the term “family values” from American political discourse. The party of endless Planned Parenthood hearings and a seemingly insatiable appetite to legislate other peoples’ sexual morals might object, but I think American voters would appreciate an end to the condescension and hypocrisy.
In the meantime, the ever so slightly more substantive political soap opera continues. Perhaps Representative McCarthy is probably lucky not too have too deal with one of the most unruly caucuses in American political history: he would have been the least experienced speaker since 1891, when Georgia Democrat Charles Frederick Crisp became top dog in the House. As McCarthy considers what sorts of public humiliation he avoided, the Republican right is now busy tarring Representative Paul Ryan, of budgeting fame, with the “not-conservative-enough” label, apparently because he had the audacity to seek a temporary compromise on spending with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.
This issue of compromise on actual legislation gets to the crux of what has gone so badly wrong in today’s House Republican caucus. Legislating has never been as romantic as some make it out to be—witness the Clinton impeachment and the foibles of the House Republican leadership 16 years ago—but even in the 1990s, people came to Washington with some intention to govern. In 1996, a Republican House compromised with President Clinton to pass what would now be apostasy: a minimum wage hike. The Gingrich-era Republican Party may have pioneered government shut downs as a negotiating tactic, but it seemed to realize that governing was its primary duty, and that it might even be good politics now and again.
In short, today’s House Republican caucus has worse problems than its 1990s predecessor, in areas far more serious than its generation of sexual rumors. One can only hope that the American electorate remembers that these people actually work for the people. Many great legislative programs in American history—Woodrow Wilson’s “New Freedom,” the New Deal, the Great Society, President Obama’s first term achievements—required legislative majorities of the President’s party to accomplish. A year from now, American voters should look to the House’s current mayhem when they decide which party has shown that it can responsibly govern the United States.

UPDATED: October 18, 2015, at 7:25 p.m.
In the Science Center Plaza Wednesday night, Sarah E. Blatt-Herold ’18 stood inside a seven foot by nine foot rectangle marked by blue tape. In her hands was a sign asking, “How should we change the prison system?”
Blatt-Herold was one of 23 students who took turns holding vigil to protest juvenile solitary confinement. This 23-hour silent vigil began Wednesday at 7p.m. and ended at 6p.m. the following evening. The rectangle was meant to represent the size of a solitary confinement cell, and the 23 hours represented the number of hours each day a prisoner would spend in the cell.
“The point about it is to make people stop and think for a second,” said Blatt-Herold, who is also the event’s organizer.
The protest was called 7x9, a national movement that occurred across 12 American universities this October. This particular protest was organized by the Harvard Undergraduate Organization for Prison Education and Reform, a subdivision of the Phillips Brooks House Association.
Eva Shang ’17, HOPE’s education director, said that this year’s event was more action-oriented, as the protest included a petition against juvenile solitary confinement which spectators could sign.
Participants said that the vigil provides a visual representation for the abstract idea of solitary confinement.
“I think for a lot of people at Harvard, it’s an issue that maybe they know about intellectually but it’s not present in their minds,” said Henry M. Gomory ’17, who participated in 7x9 last year. “It doesn’t come up in everyday life.”
For some protest participants, the event put everything in perspective. “The whole ethos of our society is embedded in technology….so imagine staring at a brick wall for that long….you’re thinking about PSETs. They’re thinking about nothing,” said Larry Cherkasov ’18, who took the protest’s second shift.
Rachel P. Thompson ’16, who also protested last year, said that HOPE is trying to utilize the Harvard name to the group’s advantage.
“We are trying to use it as a gift,” she said. “Maybe we can leverage our position.”
7x9 originated at Princeton University, and Shang brought the movement to Harvard in 2014. Students at Harvard held the vigil for the first time last fall.
Shang and Thompson both said the late-hour shifts helped them better empathize with prisoners.
“It’s not so much about raising awareness as much as it is about just being there and thinking about the people who are going through this process,” Shang said. “There’s really a sense of tremendous solidarity.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 18, 2015
An earlier version of this article misquoted the writing on a poster held by a protester at the solitary confinement vigil. In fact, the poster asked "How should we change the prison system," not "what can you do" to change it.

H. Richard Milner, a professor of education at the University of Pittsburgh, argued that race is an important factor in educational inequality in front of an audience of over 250 people at the Graduate School of Education Thursday as part of its "Askwith Forum" series.
“We know on a classroom level that race matters,” Milner said. “We need to reject these colorblind ideologies on an individual level, but also at the systemic level.”
He recommended increasing the number of adults in each classroom and making classes smaller in communities with a greater percentage of minorities. Milner also suggested that schools reform their policies on discipline and suspension, saying that teachers should work to understand the situation of students who are acting out.
In his introduction to Milner’s talk, Ed School Dean James E. Ryan highlighted the importance of having a frank discussion on race and education.
“Addressing these challenges and engaging in conversations about race and poverty can be awkward and uncomfortable," Ryan said. “But these conversations are absolutely necessary. Dr. Milner calls upon all of us to confront the issues of race and poverty.”
Milner’s presentation was followed by a question-and-answer-session with associate professor of education Natasha Kumar Warikoo. Attendees had an opportunity to ask questions, as well.
Mark E. Nelson, a student at the Graduate School of Education who attended the event, said that it is important for educators to be aware of issues of race in the classroom.
“As educators who are going to be working with diverse students, whether that be in the classroom, in research, or in policy, it’s essential that we are considering how we are meeting the needs of an increasingly diverse society,” Nelson said.
Milner said Harvard graduate students should be on the front lines of reimagining and rethinking educational inequality. He called on educators and GSE students to take direct action to address race and inequality.
“Some students will succeed because of you, and some students will succeed in spite of you,” Milner said.

Harvard’s Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights launched an Asian American studies working group on Thursday, establishing the first academic organization in the College devoted exclusively to the field.
The EMR program’s structure has in the past left students with limited options to investigate Asian American studies, said Tessa Lowinske Desmond, the EMR program administrator and academic advisor, a problem which she hopes the working group will help solve.
Undergraduate, graduate, and alumni participants in the working group’s first meeting Thursday set goals and determined the structure of the group. They identified workshopping senior theses and dissertation chapters, discussions of current events affecting the Asian American community, and involvement with local Asian American community organizations as top priorities for the group.
“There are several different constituencies that come together under this EMR umbrella: studies of ethnicity, migration, human rights, indigeneity, Native American studies, Asian American studies, and Latino studies,” Desmond said. “Now instead of having one event in Asian American studies that our office puts on each year, there will be six meetings per year, and it will give folks interested in Asian American studies a place to connect.”
Ju Yon Kim—an English professor and one of the new group’s faculty directors along with History professor Genevieve Clutario—said at the meeting that she believes the working group will foster a sense of community among students engaged with issues of Asian American history and identity.
“I hope that this becomes a home for your scholarship,” she told the students who gathered for Thursday’s meeting. “For those of you who’ve been told that what you’re doing in English or history is also Asian American studies, this can be a chance for you to participate in the development of the field.”
Jenny Choi ’16, a social studies concentrator, attended the meeting on Thursday and expressed enthusiasm for the group’s goals.
“As a thesis writer focusing on Asian American studies, I’ve had trouble finding resources on campus,” she said. “I’m so glad this support network exists now.”
Helen J. Kim, a doctoral candidate in religion and the graduate student coordinator of the new working group, approached Desmond last spring with the idea to create an organization connecting undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty working in Asian American studies at Harvard.
“The role [of the working group] is to provide an intergenerational space to talk about the field of Asian American studies, about debates in the field,” Kim said.
She added that she feels Harvard has historically neglected Asian American studies and other ethnic studies fields.
“Asian American studies probably started in the sixties, and now we’re in 2015,” she said. “There’s a long gap there, and I think we do have to ask why that is.”
For her part, Desmond said she hopes to develop working groups in Native American Studies, Latino Studies, and Human Rights Studies in the next few years. This year, EMR launched a secondary pathway in Latino Studies.
The working group plans to hold one meeting per month. The group will host its first guest speaker, University of Maryland Asian American studies professor Janelle Wong, at a lecture on October 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new Harvard research institute has granted $3.75 million to fund a project that investigates climate change and sustainable development in China.
Based at the Harvard Center Shanghai, the new Harvard Global Institute will provide grants to research projects that focus on climate and energy science, economics, engineering, and environmental health. Beijing-based real estate mogul Wang Jianlin donated the seed money to launch the institute, which bills itself as a multidisciplinary and collaborative space.
“In order to fully participate in an ever more connected world, Harvard must leverage its extraordinary intellectual and programmatic strengths with a more intentional strategy of engagement,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in a letter to faculty members announcing the institute.
The climate change research project, led by environmental studies professor Michael B. McElroy and Kennedy School of Government economist Dale W. Jorgenson, will focus its research on the carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program Chinese President Xi Jinping unveiled in Washington, D.C., last month. Called China 2030/2050, the project looks at what the climate scientists see as a crucial 20-year period during which China could make the transition to a non-fossil fuel economy.
Harvard will grant the program $1.25 million annually for three years, with the opportunity to be renewed for two more years.
The Global Institute will also conduct an environmental analysis of Chengdu, a city in China with a population of 14 million. The institute will host lectures, conferences, seminars, and a summer course in China for Harvard students.
The new institute is part of a University-wide effort to expand Harvard’s global presence. Still, Harvard has hesitated to build extensive campuses abroad—the steering committees for the institute, including the International Strategy Working Group and the Faculty Advisory Committee on Global Institutes, chose not to recommend the establishment of a “large physical presence” in Shanghai, according to a press release.
The institute's initial focus on climate change comes at a time when Harvard has come under fire for its investment practices that some environmental activists allege are unsustainable. Though student protesters have demanded that Harvard divest its endowment from fossil fuels, Faust has maintained that Harvard is effectively combating climate change through research and teaching.

A group of about 15 students staged a “die-in” in front of Harvard Hillel on Thursday night, protesting an event inside the building that featured Gedalia Gillis, an officer in the Israeli military.
The protest, organized by members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee, involved students lying down near the entrance to Hillel. Students could still enter and exit the building, and a Harvard University Police officer was present. Multiple attendees said Gillis spoke about his military experience, focusing particularly on his time of service in the summer of 2014, a time of heightened conflict and violence between Israel and Palestine in the Gaza Strip.
Many student protesters wore signs around their necks with the names of Palestinians who died during the 2014 conflict. Some students read a list of the names aloud and handed informational flyers to passersby.
“We feel that this event is very estranging and creates a hostile environment for these students on campus,” said Fatima M. Bishtawi ’17, a co-president of the Palestine Solidarity Committee.
Members of the Palestine Solidarity Committee said they were “really narrowly” protesting the evening’s speaking event at Hillel, according Andrew W. Schutts ’16, a member of the PSC.
For students who organized the speaking event at Hillel, the protest was surprising and frustrating. Yoav Shaked ’17, the president of Harvard Students for Israel, the speaking event’s organizer, said he wishes the student protesters had attended the event and aired their concerns there rather than protest outside.
Aaron Y. Grand ’18 said he fears that the students lying outside might have interfered with students entering the building. Both Grand and Shaked said the speaking event was meant to “humanize” the Israeli military and to present a perspective they said is not normally heard.
Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director of Hillel, also said he was troubled by students lying in front of the building.
“I respect a student’s right to their individual opinions and to expressing them. I’m sad because this is the first time in my five years at Harvard that I have seen an effort to interfere with the event of another organization,” Steinberg said.
According to Schutts and Bishtawi, protesters notified Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde and HUPD ahead of time. Lassonde briefly attended the protest, according to Schutts. S. Allen Counter, the director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, also stopped by to see it.
“This is a genuine and honest example of student expression about tragedies in this world,” Counter said.

Gathering under the banner of “We are Workers” Thursday, graduate students continued to voice their intent to unionize even as Harvard officials stand strong in their opposition to what University President Drew G. Faust has said would change “a mentoring relationship between faculty and students into a labor relationship.”
A panel of Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students who are part of the movement explained their motivations for seeking to unionize and create a bargaining unit. Some of their concerns included late paychecks, uncertainty in teaching positions, a lack of grievance procedures, and health and family benefits they say are unaffordable.
Members also shared the progress the movement has seen since they went public with their effort last April. More recently, the movement partnered with the United Auto Workers Union, which has helped the group as it looks to recruit new members.
Using pledge cards to gather supporters, the movement organizers are bringing in hundreds of GSAS students each week, according to John M. Nicoludis, a Chemistry graduate student. At that pace, the group is “working towards” getting signatures from 67 percent of GSAS students, said Andrew B. Donnelly, a graduate student in the English Department and a panelist at the event.
But despite optimism about their progress, attendees Thursday focused on the root issues that they say first prompted them to act.
Ellora A. Derenoncourt, a graduate student in Economics, said a 2014 Graduate Student Council survey of teaching fellows found that 20 percent of more than 1,000 respondents reported payment delays of more than two weeks. A graduate student union would help provide the graduate students with a more timely pay timetable, Derenoncourt argued.
Another major complaint raised at the event was a lack of affordable health insurance, both for individuals and for families.
Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a GSAS student, read aloud a letter written by Kirsten Y. Wesselhoeft, who was not at the event, expressing her frustration with the costs of affording medical care for her children.
“A union could help bring Harvard’s resources for graduate student parents in line with those of our peer institutions or even in line with Harvard’s own resources for other employee parents, particularly in regards to child care,” Groeger read on Wesslhoeft’s behalf.
Julie Kushner, the director of United Auto Workers Union region 9A, argued that the unionization movement is a necessary step to change graduate student working conditions across the United States.
“What we can do here tonight is really project that this is a bigger movement,” Kushner said. “There are thousands and thousands of workers in the same positions that you are that already enjoy the benefits of a union contract, and what we can do is become part of the movement.”

Harvard professors and students gathered Thursday night in the Yenching Auditorium for the Humanities Concentration Panel, which was held to inform freshmen and sophomores about the academic and professional opportunities available in the humanities.
Despite a small audience of 14, student and faculty panelists spoke for more than an hour about concentration offerings in the humanities at Harvard, their own experiences in the related disciplines, and the opportunities that humanities students from Harvard have in the professional world.
Job availability was on the minds of several students in attendance. “Inevitably one of the concerns of concentrating in the humanities is then graduating with a degree in the humanities and then having to find a job afterwards,” said Josh E. Stallings ’17, who moderated the panel.
Jake Tilton ’19, a potential Music concentrator, expressed similar concerns. “As a field, I know that humanities doesn’t have the greatest opportunities for job offers,” he said, “so I’m curious to see what people can do with these degrees.”
The panelists addressed these concerns, stressing the desirability and practicality of the communication, analytical thinking, and writing skills developed through studying in the humanities. “You learn how to read, think, and be articulate in writing and speech,” panelist and Classics professor Kathleen M. Coleman said.
Panelists also encouraged students to reach out to professors and students involved in concentrations in the humanities and to pursue opportunities through the Office of Career Services and the Harvard Alumni Association.
In addition to Coleman, the panel included post-doctoral fellow and historian Justin C. Leroy, admissions officer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12, and humanities concentrators Bridget R. Irvine ’16 and Erica X Eisen ’16, a former Crimson Arts chair.
Organized by the Harvard Undergraduate Humanities Initiative, a program created last year to encourage interest in the humanities, the event was received well by panelists and audience members.
“I’m always so happy to see students who are willing to take risks and explore areas that they’re interested in,” Gilfillian said.
Kathleen G. Barrow ’19 said that she was happy to learn of the variety of opportunities available to students interested in the humanities.“There are a lot of different directions that you can go with humanities concentrations...you’re not stuck in any particular field,” she said.

As constituencies across Harvard continue to debate how best to prevent sexual assault on campus, student leaders at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are responding to recent survey results which indicate that graduate students may be especially at risk of being sexually harassed by faculty members.
Late last month, when Harvard released the results of its sexual conduct climate survey, administered last spring at Harvard and 26 other universities, administrators decried what they described as the “deeply troubling” findings about sexual assault on campus. They put particular emphasis on Harvard College and the undergraduate senior women respondents who had experienced sexual misconduct in their time there (31 percent).
But even though they have not been the focus of administrators’ rhetoric, the survey results also detail the experiences of the students at Harvard’s many graduate and professional schools.
Overall, Harvard graduate students surveyed reported experiencing lower rates of sexual assault than their undergraduate peers: Since coming to Harvard, 7.6 percent of female graduate student respondents reported experiencing nonconsensual penetration and sexual touching, compared to 25.5 percent of female undergraduates, a category that includes affiliates of the Extension School.
Other statistics, though, stick out. In particular, graduate students who reported being sexually harassed at Harvard when surveyed last spring were more likely to identify an offender as a faculty member than their undergraduate counterparts, prompting the concern of graduate student leaders.
In the survey, the term sexual harassment encompasses being the target of sexual or crude jokes and comments, offensive comments about their bodies, emailed or texted offensive sexual remarks, or repeated unwanted requests for dinner, drinks, or sex.
Of female graduate students surveyed who said they had been sexually harassed at Harvard, 21.8 percent reported that an offender was a faculty member, compared to 6.5 percent of female undergraduates. For male graduate students who reported experiencing harassment, the percentage was also higher than their undergraduate counterparts—15.3 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively, said they had been harassed by a faculty member.
In light of the survey results, the Graduate Student Council is working with administrators to publicize the resources and reporting procedures available to students who experience harassment, according to John Gee, the group’s vice president and a History department teaching fellow.
Gee wrote in an email that “harassment is especially of concern to graduate students, who depend on their relationships with their advisors for professional advancement.”
Across the 27 schools that participated in the survey—which the Association of American Universities developed and administered through the research firm Westat—22.4 percent of female graduate and professional students who reported being sexually harassed identified a faculty member as an offender.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said graduate students, more so than undergraduates, interact regularly with faculty members for advising and to collaborate on research. This could account for the discrepancy between the two groups’ experiences with harassment, he said.
“The more contact you have, the likelier these issues will arise,” Lake said, also noting that graduate students and professors are generally closer in age than undergraduates and their professors.
Other than the survey’s findings on graduate student experiences with harassment, graduate student leaders are also responding to results that indicate that their peers are not informed about Harvard’s sexual assault response resources and reporting mechanisms.
Just 19 percent of female and 16.9 percent of male graduate students reported being “very or extremely knowledgeable” about where to seek help after experiencing sexual assault or misconduct. A higher proportion of undergraduates—36.6 percent and 35.7 percent of female and male undergraduates, respectively—said they were “very or extremely knowledgeable” on that front.
To that end, Gee wrote that the Graduate Student Council is working with GSAS administrators to publicize Harvard’s procedures for students who have experienced sexual assault or harassment.
Lake said universities across the country have been focusing on undergraduates while addressing the implementation of Title IX—the federal gender equity law. “The Title IX response in graduate schools has been somewhat lacking” in comparison, he said.
At the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ first meeting of the semester, Dean Michael D. Smith noted that there was an opening in a new Title IX coordinator position for GSAS and faculty affairs.
While he did not specifically address the issue of graduate student sexual assault and harassment, Smith said FAS is planning faculty programs to help prevent sexual assault. Efforts include faculty training, Title IX information sessions, and Title IX coordinator meetings with department representatives.

In response to increased inquiries from faculty members about graduate students’ ongoing push to unionize, administrators at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences issued guidelines on how their colleagues should respond to the movement—welcoming discussion but discouraging hostility.
The student unionization effort, which follows similar movements at peer schools and went public last spring, is gaining steam: Organizers are busy recruiting and recently partnered with the United Auto Workers Union to solicit signatures from potential members.
Harvard, though, has no obligation to recognize a union of graduate students, and University President Drew G. Faust has made her opposition to the effort clear, arguing that unionization “changes a mentoring relationship between faculty and students into a labor relationship.”
GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng suggested that other top administrators agree with Faust in a message on Wednesday to the deans and chief administrators of Harvard’s schools and various departmental directors of graduate studies.
The message, signed by Meng, addressed the unionization effort directly, acknowledging students’ involvement with the United Auto Workers and affirming Faust’s earlier comments against it. Meng writes, though, “that there must be a full and open conversation on unionization” with students and that administrators must communicate the benefits Harvard provides them.
The leaders of the student effort argue that they are Harvard employees and deserve better benefits, which they maintain they can achieve through collective bargaining.
According to Allen Aloise, GSAS’s dean for administration and finance, administrators disseminated Meng’s message with a document advising recipients on how to discuss the ongoing movement with student supporters.
The document is explicit in discouraging employees from being hostile toward prospective union members. Specifically, the guidelines say that faculty and administrators should not “threaten” students who support the union with “adverse consequences,” “engage in surveillance of union meetings,” or “interrogate” students about union activity.
It also, however, encourages them to “explain the disadvantages of union membership,” such as the prospect of annual dues. It also suggests that faculty and administrators should provide students with information about existing benefits extended to graduate students, the process of collective bargaining, and corrections for “inaccurate or misleading union statements and campaign materials.”
The document also briefly alludes to the possibility that the United Auto Workers Union, as a “new political entity,” could add “its own agenda to existing relations” between Harvard faculty and students.
Julie Kushner, the director of the United Auto Workers’ region 9A, responded to that claim at an event Thursday hosted by student organizers of the unionization effort, which is calling itself the Harvard Graduate Student Union. 
“One of the charges that is made by the dean is that the UAW has an agenda. And I just want to tell you we do—we have an agenda,” Kushner said at Harvard’s Center for Government and International Studies South building. “Our agenda is to improve conditions and create standards for graduate student workers on campuses across the United States so they are paid a living wage.”
The United Auto Workers Union represents graduate student unions and movements at peer schools such as Columbia and New York University.
Some graduate students involved in the unionization effort responded positively to the letter.
“We are glad they are talking about open discussions between students and faculty because that is what we are asking for,” said John M. Nicoludis, a graduate student in the Chemistry department. “We are asking for a voice, and it sounds like we are being heard.”
Given administrators’ unwillingness to recognize their effort, Harvard graduate students’ ability to unionize may depend on the National Labor Relations Board. In 2004, the body ruled that private universities do not have to recognize graduate student unions, but it could overturn that decision in an ongoing case at Columbia.
In his message, Meng acknowledges that the NLRB could rule that graduate students must be considered university employees. The guidelines laid out in the accompanying document, then, appear written to protect Harvard if that happens: They assume that the NLRB “would find that graduate students who perform work for the University are employees,” the document says.
Aloise reaffirmed administrators’ stance against a student union in a statement on Thursday, writing that graduate students are important to scholarship on campus, but that “we believe the University’s relationship with its graduate students is, and should remain, fundamentally an academic relationship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The women’s eight final for the 2010 World Rowing Junior Championship fell on Aug. 7, 2010. Bracing torrential downpour in Racice, Czech Republic, Kristen Faulkner—a high school senior from Homer, Alaska—kept her focus on the task at hand. Faulkner, who had started rowing just two years earlier, helped the U.S. pass Germany minutes into the race en route to a silver medal.
Fast-forward five years. This weekend, Faulkner will don the Crimson uniform as a senior member of the Harvard-Radcliffe lightweight crew team. However, not only will this be her first race in three years, it will also be her first race as a lightweight.
After a successful high school career at Phillips Academy Andover, the Alaska native entered Harvard in 2011 as a recruited heavyweight rower. That season, she sat the two position of the Crimson’s four A boat, helping Harvard claim the first-ever Ivy League Championship regatta. A month into her sophomore year, however, Faulkner left the crew team to focus on her flourishing healthcare startup.
“When I left rowing, it was not because I stopped enjoying rowing anymore,” Faulkner said. “I found it really hard to juggle rowing—a varsity sport—and computer science, and a startup. I decided I couldn’t do everything well, but I could do some things well if I really focused on them.”
Seeing her father suffer from a bad heart throughout her freshman year sparked a passion in Faulkner that drove her to co-found Prevently, a website that aims to provide one-on-one health coaching. What was once a pursuit in her free time became a job the summer before sophomore year, and eventually a big enough commitment for Faulkner to take a year off before her junior year.
In the days before she came back to Harvard in 2014, Faulkner contemplated returning to rowing.
“I remember trying on my unis because I wanted to start rowing again, but I wasn’t sure it was the right decision,” Faulkner recalled. “I really wanted to, but I wasn’t sure I could juggle it again.”
For three years after leaving the heavyweight team, Faulkner still came to the Head of the Charles to watch her friends compete. Every semester she considered returning to what—in a family of seven rowers, including her parents—had always been a huge part of her life.
As a senior, she finally decided to return to Weld Boathouse.
“I knew I’d never get the chance to row on this level again. I really missed it, and I didn’t want to be away from it anymore.” Faulkner said.
After three years away from the river, much had changed, and getting back into a rhythm took some adjustment. A workout routine that emphasized running over the rigorous strength training she had done in practices has changed her physique—causing her to switch from heavyweight to lightweight crew.
But Faulkner’s unique situation has given her more drive than ever.
“I think I came back with a lot more fire in my belly to work hard,” Faulkner said. “Having taken time off and not being as strong as I used to be, and knowing that it is my last year, gave me a sense of urgency. It’s now or never, and I have to make up for lost time.”
Being a senior walk-on has not only benefitted Faulkner, but her new teammates as well.
With only six other seniors on the roster, the squad has appreciated having an experienced presence around the boathouse.
“It’s really nice to have somebody who is fairly mature and level-headed and older around to give advice to the younger girls,” captain Ruby Emberling said.
Deciding to compete as a lightweight has yielded positive effects. At 5’6’’—on the short side for a heavyweight rower—rowing as a lightweight has allowed Faulkner to be more competitive than ever.
“[Faulkner’s] been doing so, so great,” Emberling said. “It’s been really fun to have her around…. In terms of boat speed and in terms of conversations at the dinner table, she’s a really positive force on the team.”

In preparation for the Junior World Rowing Championships, national teams are thrown into the fire immediately. Without knowing each other beforehand, the athletes begin preparation almost immediately. Generally, they have about three weeks of intense practice before the actual competition, which is held in early August.
Some of the freshmen on the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team know this life well, as five of the first-years walked into Newell Boathouse with plenty of international experience. This past August, four of them competed at the Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
At the event, Sam Meijer won Great Britain’s first Junior Men’s Quadruple Sculls to back up his silver in the same event at the 2014 Junior Worlds in Hamburg, Germany. His compatriot James Clarke came in fourth in the 2014 edition with the Great Britain Eight.
Liam Corrigan and Benji Cohen rowed on the same boat for the U.S. this year, placing fifth in the Junior Men’s Four. Corrigan also competed at Hamburg against his future Harvard teammates in the Junior Eights race, while Cohen obtained the same result in the same race.
“Two summers ago, I raced a couple of the [Harvard freshmen] who were in the Great Britain Eight and Australian Eight,” Corrigan said. “It’s a little weird, but it’s a fun thing.”
Another freshman, Lars Lorch, won the bronze medal for Germany in the Junior Men’s Eight.
As the freshmen prepare to race their first Head of the Charles donning the H, they will have a chance to prove themselves alongside their upperclassmen teammates. Just last season, the Crimson’s freshman and upperclassmen programs merged to form one team, an arrangement that made the team slightly more competitive.
All college freshmen experience a particular set of challenges, and a freshman heavyweight rower has to handle them while also managing multiple practices a day.
“From high school, college rowing is a huge step up,” Corrigan said. “[The practices are] harder and longer. In comparison to the Junior World Team, it’s a similar level of work. The only difference is now you have school on top of that. It’s definitely a lot more to try to balance rowing and school and whatever else you want to do.”
The balance of school and a varsity sport can be a challenging endeavor. However, the strict schedule of training for Worlds has helped some of the freshman adjust to the new lifestyle.
“I do all my homework after my evening sessions… and [I] have to work two or three hours every night,” Clarke said. “I seem to be on top of my work, though. I’m in bed by 11 or 12.”
The strong rookie class appears poised to rise to the challenge this weekend. Arthur Doyle, a freshman from London, will row in the 1V, while Corrigan and three other freshmen will row in the 2V.
“I’m very excited,” said Corrigan, who will race in the Head’s Championship Eight event for the first time in his career. “I think we have a really fast boat.”
Of Corrigan’s three previous races at the Head of the Charles, his best finish came last year. Going into the event, he did not expect much more than a top-20 finish—maybe top-10 if his boat was lucky.
Like all Head of the Charles races, Corrigan’s event wasn’t a head-to-head race—total time was the marker. No one on his boat knew how well they were doing until they crossed the finish line. When they did, they received some good news.
“We got off the water,” Corrigan said, “and one of our coaches was standing there and said, ‘It said here you guys have the second-fastest time.’ We were stunned.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­It was only a few years ago that Sarah Schwegman was racing in the Head of the Charles—first for her alma mater, Georgia Tech, and later for the Riverside Boat Club. This weekend, she returns to the familiar setting—this time not as a competitor, but as a coach.
In late July, as the Radcliffe lightweight crew team finished up its final race of the year, former Crimson coach Lou Berl announced that she would be stepping down. It was with a mix of excitement and sadness the team learned that it would have a new coach for the 2015 season. Sad that it would be losing a cherished coach, but excited to start a new chapter in the Radcliffe program.
“Generally we reacted like feeling this was an opportunity for a fresh perspective, and that Lou had given us a lot of tools to move forward with,” junior co-captain Ruby Emberling said.
Sharing similar sentiments, the team welcomed Schwegman into the program community.
The coach is no stranger to crew or to Harvard. After racing for Georgia Tech from 2000 to 2005, she eventually became vice president of Georgia Tech Rowing. Then after a two-year hiatus following graduation, the Boston native continued her rowing career on the international stage, rowing with Riverside in several international competitions over the next six years, including the Head of the Charles, World Championship Trials, National Selection Regattas, and U.S. Rowing Elite National Championships.
In 2012, as her rowing days began to draw to an end, Schwegman began a move from boat to shore. She started off her coaching career training the sculling program at the Riverside Boat Club, being named named a trustee in the process. She quickly branched out, coaching the Charles River Scullers and masters rowing programs at the Cambridge Boat Club.
When she was not coaching the club programs, Schwegman was either working as a real estate faculty assistant at Harvard Business School or coaching younger rowers at The Winsor School. Under her instruction, the 3V and 4V teams won the New England Interscholastic Rowing Association Championships.
This diversity of experience has bred a unique coaching style.
“Sarah is a very different trainer,” Emberling said. “She’s very systematic about how she coaches our technique, and I think Lou was more focused on getting us riled up for hard workouts and the more psychological and motivations aspect of the sport. But they both do each of those things very well.”
Though there was an initial adjustment period, it was clear from the beginning that both the rowers and the coach were on the same page when it came to setting goals for the year: continuing the momentum from a successful spring season, finishing the fall training prepared for spring competitions, and chasing another national title.
Right now, however, the focus is solely on the upcoming weekend. The Head of the Charles is a big stage early in her coaching career, but Schwegman takes the fact that her first race as head coach is the Head of the Charles all in stride.
“There is pressure, but there would be similar pressure for a first race of the season no matter the regatta,” Schwegman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The designation of a Pocock All-American is one of the highest honors one can attain in women’s collegiate rowing. The title is not just given to athletes who have racked up exemplary achievements on the water, but to those who else flourish in the classroom. This year, seniors Lauren Tracey and Frederika Archibald—members of the women’s heavyweight crew team—were honored as first-team and second-team All-Americans, respectively.
“It recognizes the top athletes in each program in the country,” said Harvard assistant coach Kelly Evans ’10 about the designation. “Basically it’s a recognition that you are a top athlete within your college rowing program and that you’ve had a strong season.”
Archibald and Tracey join the ranks of 40 other Division I female rowers across the country to receive the honor from the Collegiate Rowing Coaches Association.
To earn a spot on the Pocock All-American roster, both athletes needed to be nominated by Radcliffe Crew. To qualify for nomination, the duo had to have rowed in the varsity boat for 75 percent of the previous year’s races and meet the eligbility rules specified by Harvard. After having been nominated for the award, the duo were evaluated on individual achievements, erg scores, boat performance, and the recommendation of their coach.
This year marks the fourth time in five years that the Crimson has had more than one woman recognized as a Pocock All-American. Harvard’s three-year streak came to an end last year when only Jenna Gregoire ’15 received the nod.
Before rowing for the Crimson, Tracey and Archibald built up their rowing resumes, beginning in high school. Both athletes were avid rowers in their hometowns—Tracey in Honeoye Falls, N.Y. and Archibald in New Zealand.
“It’s the All-American award, but I’m so not American,” Archibald said.
Archibald has been a regular in the varsity boat since her freshman year in 2013, but she does not view the All-American honor as her end goal each season.
“The main goal…would be to win an Ivy Championship this year,” Archibald said. “I think that I have pretty high expectations for myself when it comes to rowing, and I expect that they transfer to the whole team. I think that translates into a pretty strong work ethic.”
At Harvard, Archibald is a psychology concentrator who is also an avid spokesperson for women’s athletics. Her most recent pursuit involved organizing a meeting between the captains of various Harvard women’s athletic teams to discuss the betterment for both mental and physical health and happiness of women in athletics.
For Tracey, the accolade of Pocock All-American came as a surprise. She picked up rowing in high school on a whim but was unsure about her standing both as a student and an athlete during her freshman year of college. However, as a senior, Tracey has more than comfortably fulfilled both roles to the best of her ability.
“I started rowing because my mom rowed for a year in college,” Tracey said. “My first year here it took me a while to adjust to school. I trained really hard over the summers and rededicated myself to rowing, and it’s been a huge part of my time at school.”
Evans notes the drive that earned Archibald and Tracey the awards has helped the entire team continue to strive.
“Lauren and Freddie are both athletes that are consistently at the top of the program, both in terms of their strengths on the erg and their success on the water,” Evans said. “Both drive the team to higher and higher standards—that’s just who they are. They’re both tough. They row well, they train hard, and they’re committed to winning and committed to going fast.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Before an afternoon practice, Newell Boathouse is a bustle of activity. People stream through the front doors, ready for another day out on the Charles. The oarsmen stretch before preparing the boats and oars for use. At the end of the launch stand three men, unmoving against the background of activity on the dock. Men’s heavyweight crew coach Charley Butt is in the middle of the trio, his calm demeanor appropriate of his status as a 30-year Harvard icon.
Having graduated from Rutgers University in 1983, Butt was hired as the Harvard lightweight crew coach two years later and has been with the Crimson ever since. He was nearing his 30th season with the lightweights, but after the recent passing of legendary heavyweight coach Harry Parker, Butt shifted into a new role leading the men’s heavyweights.
Spending three decades at the same job usually leads to consistency in one’s daily—and even yearly—routine. Despite the abrupt change in responsibility, Butt’s background in the sport allowed him to adapt quickly and confidently to his new position.
Prior to leading the heavyweight squad, Butt worked with members of both the heavyweights and lightweights at the international level. The son of a crew coach, Butt has coached Harvard male and female rowers in four different Olympics.
“Charley brings a wealth of Olympic and national team experience to the program, and in particular an emphasis on small boats,” Harvard assistant coach William Boyce said. “Whether it’s pairs or singles, we are able to spend a lot of time in the mornings out in small boats with Charley coaching them, and I think the guys really benefit and develop from that.”
Butt’s 2014 campaign—his second with the heavyweights—proved to be a success, as the team went 8-0 in its dual season, performed well at larger regattas throughout the year, and lengthened its winning streak in the EARC Sprints to five.
Although the lightweights and heavyweights are separate teams, Butt says there are not as many differences between the two as people perceive.
“Outside of the obvious differences in the physical dimensions of the people involved . . . I don’t really find that much of a difference,” Butt said. “You can train the larger people a little more because they don’t have to restrict their calorie intake, but. . . it just takes an awful lot of the same qualities to succeed in the sport in general.”
With two years of coaching the heavyweight team under his belt, Butt is focused on applying what he has learned from his Olympic experience and from the past two years to his coaching style in order to continue the team’s success this season.
“The main thing we’re doing differently this year is we’re running a ladder so that the guys are competing with each other directly throughout the year,” Butt said.
From his inaugural year at Harvard until this season, Butt has seen many classes of oarsmen begin and end their rowing careers with the Crimson. Even though a lot has changed since 1985, the path to success for crew teams has not been altered much.
“What made a champion 30, 40, or 50 years ago is what makes a champion today,” Butt said.
After more than 30 years spent coaching Harvard’s lightweight and heavyweight teams, Butt still enjoys his job as much as he did during his first season.
“Finding work here in 1985 was a dream come true because I got to come to Boston and work at Harvard with a guy named Harry Parker, and it was a tremendous experience,” Butt said. “I felt like I learned a lot every year from the people around me and from the students as well.”
“If you’re willing to listen, you’ll learn from everybody around you,” Butt added. “The best part of Harvard is the people here. It’s not the institution, but it’s the people who make it up who are the real draw and the real area of interest for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To find the last time the Harvard men’s soccer team started Ivy League play with three straight wins, you’d have to look back to the 2008 season. Before that, you’d have to go back to last century.
This rare feat, however, is what the team has a chance to accomplish this Saturday against Brown.
The 3-0 conference record isn’t the only benchmark the Crimson can pass at Jordan Field this weekend. If the squad’s defense, led by goalkeeper and co-captain Evan Mendez, can manage to keep a clean sheet for the third straight game, it will also mark the longest streak of no goals allowed since 2009.
The 2008 and 2009 seasons happen to mark the best two-year run in the NCAA Tournament that Harvard has had in recent memory.
While the comparisons to those great teams of the past are growing in head coach Pieter Lehrer’s third year at the helm, the team is aware of how fast fortunes can change in Ancient Eight play.
The Crimson was exactly at this point a season ago, entering the game against Brown with two conference wins and momentum riding high. A draw with the Bears–and subsequent loss to Princeton–however, effectively put the team out of the Ivy League title race and dashed hopes of an NCAA tournament berth.
“We’re super focused for this weekend because we remember exactly what happened last year,” senior forward Oliver White said. “We were doing really well, and all of a sudden, it was like our season was over.”
Such is the nature of competition in the Ivy League, with every one of each team’s seven Ancient Eight games having the potential to make or break a season.
Brown, just like last season, is certainly capable of playing spoiler to Harvard’s strong start. Not only are the Bears also unbeaten in conference play, but they boast the Ivy’s second best scoring offense, as well. Thus far, they have scored 16 goals to Harvard’s 11, and are led by three time Ivy League Rookie of the Week Jack Hagstrom.
Despite being a defender, Hagstrom ranks second in the league with five tallies to his name. He headed in the equalizing goal late in both of the Bears’ two conference matchups thus far, one of which led to a comeback win and the other of which secured an important draw.
“Brown is usually a very physical team, and one of the reasons we tied them last year was we weren’t ready for that,” White said.
Being unprepared is not an option for this year’s matchup, however, as six seniors anchor the Crimson starting lineup and several others feature prominently off the bench. This season marks the final shot at an elusive Ivy title for these players, who have come a long way from finishing last-place in the conference during their freshman year.
According to White, this sense of urgency is what has fueled the team’s resurgence after a string of losses to start the season.
Before Harvard began their current streak of shutting out opponents, it suffered through the exact opposite, not scoring for over 300 minutes, punctuated by a 3-0 loss against Boston University.
Another big part of Crimson’s three straight wins since then is the developing chemistry in the squad’s back-line. With co-captain and reigning Ivy League defensive player of the year Mark Ashby injured all season, junior center-backs Alex Leondis and Dan Smith have had to adjust to playing with each other.
“[Leondis and Smith have] been working really hard to improve this season, and it’s definitely showing in the past few games,” Ashby said. “They’re gaining confidence and playing much better.”
The two players, along with the rest of the defense, will certainly be tested on Saturday. Brown has scored in 10 of the 11 games it has played in this season, including a 2-0 win earlier this week over the same BU team that beat Harvard.
From this result, it might seem as if Brown has the upper edge, but with both teams playing great soccer right now, the game is one that must be settled on the field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In the combined 10 games that the Harvard and Lafayette football teams have played this season, the two squads share a single opponent: Georgetown.
On October 2, the Crimson (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) dispatched the Hoyas, 45-0, in a four-quarter drumming.
The very next week, Georgetown faced off against the Leopards (1-5, 0-2 Patriot League) in Washington, D.C. This time the result was markedly different, as the Hoyas cruised to a 38-7 victory.
That imbalance in result tells you all you need to know about Saturday’s matchup between Harvard and Lafayette. Riding an 18-game win streak, the Crimson will head south to Easton, Pa. in full expectation of a blowout.
“We are going to bring it all to them,” said senior defensive end James Duberg. “[It’s a] great opportunity to get some young guys in there assuming that we take care of business in the first half. Lots of blitzes going in this week—fun stuff.”
Certainly the two teams have had very different seasons so far. The Leopards’ only win of the season came against lowly Wagner, which currently has an 0-5 record and lost 26-3 to a perpetually struggling Columbia team.
If the Lafayette ship is going down, then the leaks are on all sides. While the Leopards’ defense has let up an average of 32 points per game, the offense has been just as dismal, putting up a season total of 72.
Lafayette seems destined to finish worse than last year, when it stuttered to a 5-6 record.
By contrast Harvard has not lost since 2013, when it dropped an overtime game to Princeton.
What has been consistent about the Crimson over the last two years is that it has not played down to supposedly weaker opponents. So far this season, Harvard has won its games by an average score of 45-10.
“We have a very experienced offense, with the combination of having the right personnel and a great coaching staff,” said senior tight end Ben Braunecker.
Experience has obvious payoffs, as the attack has produced a total of 478 yards per game, neatly split between 202 yards on the ground and 276 yards in the air.
“It is really hard for the defense to scheme around us,” Braunecker said. “It’s almost like the old cliché—pick your poison. If you stop the run game, we’ll beat you in the pass game. And if they switch coverage, we’ll pound them in the running game.”
As for the defense, the Crimson has been lights out limiting its opponents to just 95 rush yards and 180 passing yards per game.
Similar dominance stems from he team’s stellar depth. All starting members of the secondary are seniors, and the old hands have united into a first unit that has not conceded a touchdown in its last three outings.
“We have a veteran defense,” Duberg said. “A lot of us have 14 games under our belt. We have lots of returning starters on both sides of the ball.”
Unfortunately for the Leopards, the prospect of playing at home does not offer much shelter. So far this season, Lafayette has been outscored 105-21 at Fisher Field.
These statistics will surely cause senior running backPaul Stanton, Jr.to lick his lips as he attempts to add on to his 102 yards per game average so far this season.
The same can be said about senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer, who is currently averaging 91 yards per game. Despite sitting out last weekend because of an upper-body injury, Fischer expects to be back in action on Saturday.
But individual accolades aside, the Crimson aims to use this weekend as a clean dry-run for the rest of Ivy League play, which will resume next weekend when Harvard hosts Penn.
“The most important thing for us, going into a non-conference team on a four-game win streak, is to not have a let down,” said Braunecker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team added a seventh member to its 2016 recruiting class with the verbal commitment of three-star recruit Henry Welsh. Welsh, a 6’9” center from Loyola High School in Los Angeles, took to Twitter Wednesday morning to announce his decision to join the Crimson.
As a junior at Loyola, Welsh averaged 11 points per game and was second on the team with 9.2 rebounds per contest. He was the third member of last season’s team, which finished the year with a 20-10 record, to commit to a Division I program. Point guard Max Hazzard is now a freshman at UC Irvine while Stone Gettings will travel to Cambridge on Jan. 29 as a member of Cornell’s team.
Several recruiting outlets laud Welsh’s length and his steady improvement over three seasons at Loyola. One website says that the center has “a nice touch around the basket” and “is a good passer, especially from the high post”.
In addition to Harvard, Welsh also took official visits to UC Irvine and Lehigh. He is the third big man to commit to the Crimson in the class of 2016, joining top 100 power forward recruits Chris Lewis and Robert Baker, Jr.
Welsh is also the second pledge Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has received in the last week. Bryce Aiken, a four-star point guard from Randolph, N.J. committed to the Crimson last Thursday. Harvard’s recruiting class for next season is currently ranked as the 27th-best in nation by 247 Sports.
He is the second player in next year’s class from Los Angeles County to commit to the Crimson, joining point guard Christian Juzang. Current freshmen Robbie Feinberg and Tommy McCarthy and junior Zena Edosomwan also hail from Southern California.
Assuming Siyani Chambers ’16 returns to the team next fall following his ACL tear and all of this year’s non-graduating players return, Harvard will have 21 players competing for playing time next season.

And then this happened.
My levels of sadness were great.

Sophomores struggling through their proverbial slump can take solace in the fact they’re not alone; Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana is also dealing with a taxing second year. But while sophomores will have to console themselves with infrequent study breaks, Khurana is shaking things up the way Harvard Business School taught him—by acquiring a sweet new ride.
However, the wheels attached to Khurana’s mid-life crisis number two instead of four. That’s right, the dean has a Vespa!
In an exclusive email exchange with Flyby, Khurana said his love of scooters goes all the way back to his childhood, and that he “thought it would be a fun way to get around the Harvard neighborhood.” After test-driving the Vespa of another Cabot community member, he said his family could tell how happy he was and supported his desire to get one. And, “it was also way cheaper than a number of other ways a person can go through a mid-life crisis.”
Every quadling knows the dangers of speeding on a bike down a rain-slickened Garden street, half awake peddling perilously close to the shuttle, and Khurana as house master of Cabot is no different. He said his wife and children were concerned for his safety. The deal they made? Rakesh was allowed a Vespa if he promised to “ride it very carefully and always wear a helmet.” Seems like a fair bargain to us at Flyby.
So what does this mean for you College students?
1) It already seems like Dean Khurana is at every meeting but now, with the time traveling capabilities of a Vespa, he will actually be at every town hall and extracurricular group meeting
2) Everyone Quadded on Housing Day gets a Vespa
3) Anyone who spots Khurana Vespa-ing without a helmet gets a $5 gift card to Cabot Cafe courtesy of Stephanie Khurana
4) Looking to win favor with the Dean? Rumor has it he still needs special Vespa gloves, and they’re only sold in Portland. It’s just a quick flight away and you’ll be allowed to host an inclusive Vespa-themed party in Cabot’s “Aquarium” as payment. Faux-leather jackets optional
