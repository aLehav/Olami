After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Richard Linklater’s “Before Sunrise” posits that sharing a long train ride with a stranger is romantic. In his sophomore film, “Hytti Nro. 6” or “Compartment No. 6,” however, director Juho Kuosmanen would seem to disagree.
The film, which premiered on July 10 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, follows Laura (Seidi Haarla), a Finnish student in Russia, as she embarks on a cross country train trip to visit the petroglyphs in Murmansk. She was supposed to be joined by the university professor with whom she has a relationship, Irina (Dinara Drukarova), but when Irina must cancel for reasons that go largely unexplained, Laura goes alone. On the journey, she is forced to share the train compartment with an abrasive, alcoholic, and aggressive miner named Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov), who’s also taking the entire trip up to Murmansk. Immediately, Laura and Ljoha appear to be solid enemies, a relationship which eventually gives way to something not unlike love.
A tale told in small spaces — cramped train compartments, the passenger seat of a car, the inside of a phone booth — “Compartment No. 6” is primarily concerned with exploring closeness. Through intimately close shots and shaky cameras, cinematographer JP Passi creates an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia, one that is only overcome as Laura and Ljoha’s relationship evolves. Tight frames wrapped around Laura and Ljoha amplify their every move as they communicate through glances and tense body language. Over the days-long train ride, Kuosmanen slowly peels back the thick tension between the pair, showcasing his talent for packing simple scenes with clear emotion.
Like the film itself, Laura, too, struggles largely with closeness and the perception of it. Her relationship with Irina is one that is inextricably tied to how the literature professor looks at her, and how it feels for Laura to be noticed so intimately. And with Ljoha, the opposite is true. Where Laura desired constant closeness to Irina, Ljoha feels much too close for comfort from the beginning — too loud, too comfortable, too much. The tiny space they share on the train starts out more like a prison than anything else. It is only when they have a little more air, and the shots are a little wider, that she manages to break down Ljoha’s unforgiving exterior, revealing what many could see as a mere lost soul (despite being one which also causes Laura significant fear and distress).
At times, however, the film is much too slow. While the steady pacing of Laura and Ljoha’s relationship — always at a crawl — is intoxicatingly captivating when it's successful, it is often conveyed in such still, lingering scenes, through subtle movements and short dialogue, that the film’s climax feels, in short, anticlimactic. The relationship that the pair develop towards the end of the film is not given the final push it needs to feel adequately convincing, and instead falls somewhat flat.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a great day for lesbians here at the Cannes Film Festival. Your favorite girl in red stan is fully hydrated and got a whopping 7 (ish) hours of sleep, and my caffeine intake might even be slowly returning to normal (fingers crossed). But of course, far more importantly, the festival’s first films featuring queer couples are premiering right next to each other tonight! (No, I am not counting the Matt Damon one because of Abigail Breslin’s earrings. I will not be taking questions at this time) Anyways, I’ve had my fill of “misunderstood” male artists and one-dimensional women, and I’m ready for some gay content.
(in SpongeBob narrator voice) Twelve hours later.
Well, I’m reporting back to you after the gay nuns movie, and I must say — I thought I was here for representation, not a straight man’s lesbian porn. Clearly, I was wrong: read more here.
Unfortunately, “Benedetta” was only the first of the past two days’ homophobic incidents. I awoke the next day to yet another travesty: a theater that, unbeknownst to me, was a 20 minute bus ride away from the Palais. As you can likely guess, that was a little too much to ask of your favorite transportation-challenged lesbian, and I proceeded to take not one, but two incorrect buses that landed me well outside the city of Cannes. (It’s the “curse of the homosexual,” as Wes Anderson eloquently puts it in “The French Dispatch.”) As I waited next to an apparently broken-down bus, I was approached rather belligerently by an old man who took this opportunity to recite every English word he knew, in no particular order, to the “tourist” (his favorite one) wearing a velvet jumpsuit in the middle of the afternoon. A lovely time.
On the bright side, I wasn’t ready to brave the ride back right away, so I wrote an entire review while sitting on the asphalt of a parking lot.
Once I finally made it back to the Palais, I geared up for the second lesbian event of the festival: Catherine Corsini’s “La Fracture.” This one was at least made by a queer woman, who certainly seemed to know her wag around a toxic and codependent lesbian couple. But the film had its own host of problems — and Julie and Raf should 100% break up.
So at the end of the day, it seems like it wasn’t such a great day for lesbians after all. Guess I’m just going to have to write my own lesbian nun movie!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the twelfth of July, in the year of our Lord two-thousand-twenty-one, I met Timothée Chalamet.
He was on the red carpet for his very first Cannes premiere, the Wes Anderson-directed “The French Dispatch,” the gold of his metallic Tom Ford suit dazzling under the bright Cannes sunlight. I was right behind the barricade, sweaty and tired after waiting in line for five-plus hours in the brutal heat. By all accounts, it was a match made in heaven.
After coming all the way to the French Riviera for this express reason (please don’t tell Crimson film execs Lanz Aaron G. Tan or Jaden S. Thompson), the 5-second conversation I had with him and subsequent selfie were proof it was all worth it.
The odyssey to the red carpet had started two days before, when Arts Chair emeritus Caroline Tsai ‘20 and I — the resident Timothée fans at Cannes — started our effort to secure “French Dispatch” tickets. Waking up at the ripe hour of 7 a.m. to check the festival tickets page, we were heartbroken to find that all three screenings of the film were sold out. (Yes, there were only three opening screenings for the biggest film of the festival. And yes, one of them was at one of the smallest venues at the festival.) Thus began a 48-hour spell of compulsive refreshing, both of us desperate to find a coveted ticket. I, for one, checked the ticketing website on my phone every 15 minutes, every 20 if I was feeling risky.
“SOFI,” Caroline texted our Cannes group chat at 10:25 p.m. on Sunday. “HE’S HERE.” I was in a late-night screening when I surreptitiously opened my phone to see a picture she had sent of Chalamet with a fan at a French airport. Still in that aforementioned screening, I started to log into the ticketing website again, my heart racing.
“DISPATCH OPRN! GONNOW!” I texted Caroline and Joy at 11:28 p.m., the typos a result of the fact that I was holding my phone under my seat while simultaneously trying to watch an entire film and take notes on it in the dark. The 7:30 p.m. slot had opened up, and I wasted no time in booking. At 12:37 a.m., Caroline finally responds: “I BOOKED 7:30 FRENCH DISPATCH … THE RELIEF COURSING THROUGH MY BODY AT THIS MINUTE.” I watched the rest of my screening, for the first time in days, totally at peace.
The next morning at 10:03 a.m., from Caroline: “good morning rise and shine it’s french dispatch day.”
Our plan for the rest of the day was ambitious: Wake up, get dressed, and arrive at the barricade closest to the red carpet as soon as possible, armed with charged laptops and phones to carry us through a day’s work. At around 2 p.m., we settled in, made some friends, and prepared ourselves for hours of waiting on the concrete floor. At around 6:30 p.m., the celebrities started rolling in in their black vans. Finally, after a string of folks-we-wish-we-knew-but-didn’t, we saw Bill Murray staring out from a Greyhound Bus down the road. We all lost it.
The cast for “The French Dispatch,” including director Wes Anderson, all appeared out from the bus like a vision: Tilda Swinton’s bright-pink-with-green-sequins blazer; Owen Wilson, Benicio Del Toro, and Anderson in their black suits; and eventually, in the distance, Chalamet in that iconic golden getup, complete with pierced ears and silver Cartier rings. What came next was a blur: we screamed his name, he came up to us, I asked for a selfie, we chatted, he signed my notebook, the next person called and he moved on. Like a dream, it was over before I really knew what was going on.
With our quest complete, Caroline and I ran back to the Palais, quickly debriefed over a San Pellegrino, and got to our “French Dispatch” screening with just enough time to post my Timothée content on Instagram. By the time we left the theater, the stan accounts had found it, and I checked my phone to see hundreds of notifications (and texts from my mom with screenshots from every account that had reposted it). I also found, much to my surprise, that someone had taken a video of the conversation we had (if you can even quantify 5 seconds as a conversation), and that it was now everywhere. Of course, that wouldn’t be a problem if I had remembered to carry a conversation like a normal person, but I didn’t. He asked me if I was American, I said yes. He asked me how I got here, and my very frazzled self thought it would be a good idea to answer “on a plane.” Before I could save myself, he was gone. (But because I have no regrets, I’ve linked the video for your enjoyment here.)
Although I’ve been occasionally cringing at that response throughout the day, I’ve found solidarity from my few, but sympathetic, supporters. Here’s to hoping he’ll see this and give me a do over?

“Legally Blonde” is iconic. It’s been 20 years and “What, like it’s hard?” is still as quotable as ever. Harvard students will be familiar with mentioning their college only to hear “Oh, like in ‘Legally Blonde?’” as the response. It’s fantastic.
For the uninitiated, “Legally Blonde” follows college senior Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon), who, when her boyfriend breaks up with her instead of proposing, decides to follow him to Harvard Law School to win him back. Naturally, hijinks ensue and Elle learns the power of believing in herself and that it is possible to be both stereotypically blonde and smart.
“Legally Blonde” is often classified as a romantic comedy. While it is at times both romantic and comedic, this classification misses the point entirely: “Legally Blonde” is not a romance.
Take the opening scene: The viewer is introduced to Elle’s fellow sorority members, showing how much they care for her and how excited they are for her impending engagement. “Perfect Day” by Hoku plays in the background to hint that Elle’s perfect day is the idea of marriage to her “perfect guy” and the beginning of the rest of her life — the life everyone around her has always expected of her and that, until now, she has never questioned. This is a very natural set-up for a romance, but it’s a classic misdirection. Similarly, Elle’s driving motivation throughout most of the movie is, ostensibly, to win back her boyfriend Warner (Matthew Davis), but that isn’t really the point. When Elle realises Warner will never respect her (in the excellent party scene) she decides to succeed at Harvard for herself. Warner quickly becomes irrelevant.
Elle’s other romantic relationship is with recent graduate Emmett (Luke Wilson), who exists to give Elle the push to take herself seriously. He is a nice addition and a good foil for Elle’s wealth (though that subplot doesn’t really go anywhere), yet the majority of their romantic relationship occurs off-screen. This would be weird for a rom-com, but, once again, “Legally Blonde” is not a romance.
Far greater weight is given to her platonic relationships, like her sorority friends. When presented with a seemingly outlandish goal of getting into Harvard, they all cheered for her. They didn’t doubt her. The new friendships Elle forms in Cambridge show how women should support each other, and show Elle to be a genuine, kind person. At her lowest point, when she needed the support of a professional rather than her peers, Elle’s female professor told her not to give up. That professor quickly became the first adult whom she looked up to to really believe in her. That’s why this is the turning point. She doesn’t seek out her ex-boyfriend or new love interest: She is fortified by her existing friendships and professional connections with women.
This is also why Elle works as a character. It’s established in one of the first scenes that she is genuinely intelligent, but no one has ever really expected her to be anything. Moreover, Elle is unapologetically hyperfeminine, and it’s shown that people make assumptions about her intellect because of that. While she has her silly and insensitive moments, she also works really hard to succeed for herself. Elle is a worthy protagonist because while she doesn’t fundamentally change, she grows as a person — after all, she saves the day with her knowledge of hair care.
So, “Legally Blonde” isn’t a love story. It’s an example of female empowerment done well. And while “female empowerment” is often used as a buzzword whenever a female character is present, Elle is an example of an important female character who actually impacts the narrative. Still, it is important to point out that Elle Woods is extraordinarily privileged: She is a rich white woman with a massive support network. Being dismissed as a “dumb blonde” is in no way comparable to any form of actual systemic discrimination.
At the end of the movie, the song and motif of Elle’s “Perfect Day” returns, also featuring an impending engagement, but the engagement is once again entirely not the point. The beginning of the film saw Elle settling for the life that had been drawn for her, and while there is nothing wrong with that life, it wasn’t what she truly wanted. And so the ending is also about something larger: It’s about how proud she is of how far she’s come, and the massive achievement of succeeding at Law School — the thing she chose in the end. It’s therefore disingenuous to call her story a romance when it is far more about self-love and determination.
Ultimately, “Legally Blonde” is an uplifting movie about believing in yourself, and expecting more from yourself even when others don’t. And 20 years later, it still holds up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Specialty card retailer Lovepop opened its largest brick-and-mortar store yet in Harvard Square last Tuesday.
The new store — located at 18 JFK St., previously occupied by greeting card and stationery chain Papyrus — will offer a variety of 3D products, such as cards, flower bouquets, and giant pop-up gifts.
Harvard Business School alumni Wombi S. Rose and John P. Wise launched the company in a basement in Harvard Square in 2014. The pair first met as students at the Webb Institute, studying naval architecture and marine engineering. The pair later reunited at HBS, where they encountered kirigami — a paper art form similar to origami that includes cutting of the paper — on a school trip to Vietnam.
Rose and Wise quickly noticed a resemblance between kirigami and naval architecture.
“When you design a ship, you take a 3D shape, and you slice it into planes, and where those planes intersect, you draw a line. That's called a lines plan,” Rose said in an interview. “When we looked at this style, the sliceform kirigami, we recognized that this is exactly the same process, only in miniature, for how you design the hull of a ship.”
A year after Rose and Wise launched their company, they appeared on entrepreneurship TV show Shark Tank, where they received a $300,000 investment from Canadian businessman Kevin O’Leary for a 15 percent stake in the business.
“We had an incredible opportunity that I think is one of the best ways to share what you’re doing with such a big audience in the U.S.,” Rose said. “We put a lot of energy and effort and preparation into coming with our best business plan, our best product line.”
“We’re very fortunate to be able to attract an investment from Kevin O’Leary — Mr. Wonderful — who has been a huge supporter of Lovepop through the year and continues to this day to help get the word out about the magical moments we make,” he added.
Since its founding, Lovepop has adopted an omnichannel sales approach, which seeks to provide consumers with a unified customer experience wherever they may shop.
While the Harvard Square location will be the fifth physical store Lovepop has opened nationwide since the beginning of 2020, the company still sells most of its products online on its website, Rose said.
Rose added that the growth of Lovepop over the past year has been “exciting.”
“[Lovepop] has been growing really fast over the past year, despite the challenges overall in retail, and we’re just excited to continue to double down on what we’re doing in that area,” he said.
