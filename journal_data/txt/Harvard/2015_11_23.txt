After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the brand remains untarnished, many doubt the merits of a Harvard College education: The only thing that matters at Harvard is the degree; the hardest part of Harvard is getting in; Harvard is too focused on its graduate schools to really teach undergraduates. Whether true or not, these claims stem in part from the constant trade-off that Harvard faces as an institution of both elite research and elite education.
A recent study seems to confirm that other universities face similar challenges. According to the researchers, who studied two unnamed universities, tenure-track faculty members are less involved in their university communities than their non-tenure-track counterparts, especially when it comes to spending time with undergraduates. In the words of Nathan F. Allemann, a professor at Baylor University and one of the study’s co-authors, this division of responsibility “is to the detriment of seeing teachers as experts, especially in research-focused institutions.”
As Allemann suggests, the findings of his research reflect the process by which universities evaluate tenure-track faculty members—a process that itself could use some critical evaluation. In the tenure process, universities place a premium on the quantity and quality of published work. At least comparatively, they neglect the teaching styles and abilities of candidates. As a result, the best academics are motivated to pursue their own independent research, but often feel they cannot devote as much attention to teaching.
Redressing this imbalance would be a welcome shift to the tenure process. Of course, Harvard's capacity for research is part of what makes the University special, and it should continue to strive to attract the best talent in academia. As the recent pattern of economics professors leaving for Stanford has shown, resources for research are crucial to building strong departments that can teach undergraduates effectively. But while research will always be a core component of Harvard’s mission, renewed focus on undergraduate teaching would help ensure that Harvard’s role as a research university not detract from the quality of its teaching.
Harvard, along with its peer institutions, should make clear to tenure-track faculty that expectations for teaching and interactions with undergraduates are high. Part of this change in emphasis would entail reducing the already substantial quantity of published work required to be a serious candidate for tenure, so that tenure-track faculty could dedicate more time to teaching without worrying about sacrificing their career goals.
Harvard has the potential to lead the academic community to a better balance between teaching and research. Changes to the tenure process are a promising way to make progress towards that goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both in the cries of my peers who have taken to activism, and in the conversations I hear and take part in daily, criticizing “the West” seems to be much in vogue. To anyone on Harvard’s campus—or, I suspect, on most campuses—or anyone who has viewed the Ivy League Snapchat story over the past couple of days, or anyone who has read a college newspaper, a sometimes vague and sometimes sharp anti-Western sentiment is palpable.
The charges against the West are plain and severe: sexism, racism, homophobia, and all the evils they precipitate. Both to signal our disapproval of these wrongs, and to prevent them from taking hold of new generations, I have heard suggestions ranging from universities mandating classes in women and gender, African and African-American, Latin American, and East Asian studies, to deemphasizing the importance of the Western canon. In the next couple of paragraphs, I want to argue against both the sentiments and the suggestions attached to them. The West and its canon contain deep truths, beauties, and insights that would be lost if not studied. And the complaints leveled against those texts, I believe, are incoherent.
Let’s take a moment to reflect on the fact that to offer an unqualified defense of Western civilization might be seen as provocative. But because it might be, it behooves me to clarify exactly what I am and am not arguing. I am not preaching some sort of Euro-centrism or Euro–supremacy. I am not saying that only what the West has to offer is worthy of study or has value. I am too ignorant of other traditions to make those comparative statements. Instead, this is more of an attack on an attack. I want to push back against the Western tradition’s most recent campus critics, and in doing so highlight the important role it should serve in our education.
The first point to note is that there might not even by a Western tradition that one can criticize or defend. Commonly, when one refers to the West, one is referring to something that spans millennia, cultures, languages, and even continents. It is startlingly diverse. The West has produced “The Five Books of Moses” and “The Communist Manifesto”; Voltaire and Plato; Churchill and Hitler. In the West, we are somehow able to coherently praise the self-effacement and humility of Jesus as well as the bravado of the Greek heroes. When the West looks for beauty, it can direct its gaze at a Pietà or a Man Ray. The West encompasses a lot, and to speak of it as a monolith, as if all it contains speaks with one voice or has one common vision, is to be frighteningly reductive and ignorant.
I have always found it strange that we have a strong concept of Orientalism but no real conversations about Occidentalism. Just as I think it shameful that for so long many Westerners reduced the Eastern world—as complex and variegated as the West—to a minaret, a spice trader, or an opium den, I think it shameful that others continue to reduce the West to English aristocrats sipping tea, German and French philosophers absorbed in their own suffering or mental efforts, or a bunch of dead Greeks and Romans.
I anticipate that my interlocutor has a rebuttal. True, someone might say, the West is diverse, so diverse in fact, that it only has one thing in common: its exclusion and oppression. That is, the seminal figures in the West have nearly all been white, male, heterosexual, cisgender, et cetera, and studying the West therefore precludes the experiences of people who do not fit into those categories, and thus excludes the people themselves. How, the argument goes, can a Native America learn from John Locke, who authored, among other things, a charter for an early colony?
But is not this charge somewhat strange? It rests on a severely restricted vision of empathy and imagination, both for the creators and consumers of culture. Who better to read Kierkegaard or Camus (two, I should point out, extremely different thinkers) than someone who feels alienated from today’s society? Tolstoy’s “A Confession," which takes the reader through his crisis of faith and the depression it induced, is perfect for the disillusioned, not the comfortable. Great works, in short, are great because they can speak beyond the circumstances in which they were created.
There is also something transcendent about knowledge. One does not need to be a Scott or a Britt or a man or straight to make sense of Hume’s critique of induction, and Kant’s criticism of revolution does not raise problems only for those rebelling in Germany. For the critics of the West to argue against this point would be self-defeating: If non-Westerners cannot learn from the West’s canonical figures, how can they expect Westerners to learn from their greatest thinkers? To make racial, sexual, and cultural sameness a prerequisite of learning from someone is to Balkanize knowledge, and make learning impossible.
I also endorse the hard case, where the figure in question was, either in his work or in his life, explicitly racial and hateful. What I have just written is not just words for me, but something that I actually live by and with. As a Jew and the grandson of four Holocaust survivors, I come from a tradition that was not just excluded from the West, but actively persecuted by it. It was not long ago that a part of the Western world tried to exterminate Judaism, and even recently Judaism has been under assault in Europe.
I can recognize that Martin Heidegger—a member of the Nazi Party whose anti-Semitism was a non-trivial part of his philosophy—was a brilliant philosopher who has much to teach me, just as I can recognize the beauty in one of Wagner’s operas in spite of his famed anti-Semitism. It would have been pathetic of me to not get past the ostensible anti-Semitism of Marx’s “On the Jewish Question” and therefore deny myself the opportunity to access and debate the ideas contained within. If I fail to struggle with the West’s complicated legacy, and fail to embrace the undeniable offerings it has because of that, I am the one who loses out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t travel to New Haven in a “lit” shuttle this weekend. Instead, a few friends and I ordered Thai and sat in a circle on a fraying rug in their suite. We listened to Fleet Foxes as we picked around at noodles and egg rolls, spilling some soy sauce here, there, and mostly everywhere.
We talked a lot about our first impressions of each other, about how and when cordial friendship gave way to a sisterly kind of intimacy. Occasionally, we checked Facebook for updates about the Game, looking with vague interest at the flushed faces of our peers decked out in Crimson gear appearing, one after the other, in our newsfeeds. After a couple of hours had passed, we returned to our respectful positions: One friend lay sprawled on a futon with a book on her lap and her legs extended straight in the air, reaching for the ceiling. Another sat at her desk, pounding the keys on her Mac at a furious, frantic pace while tapping a heel and whistling. I put on my headphones and began to write this column, looking around the room, every so often, for inspiration. And that’s how we remained for the next few hours: in silence but surrounded by peripheral sounds. 
I should have felt lonely, but I didn’t. I felt something like comfort. Safety. Contentment.
*****
The more I become used to this place (by place, I mean both Harvard and the world at large), the more I become used to—expect, really—a certain amount of loneliness. It seeps into my bones and makes my legs woozy and head weary, mostly when I am in large crowds. Often when I am in section.
This feeling is exacerbated by tragedy and straight racism, by the sinking realization that the tragedy is linked to people who claim to share my religion, and the racism is lurking near.
I’m talking about the Beirut bombings and the Paris attacks and the Muslim woman in Toronto who was punched in the stomach, called a “terrorist,” and robbed of her money, a scarf, and any sense of security.
I’m talking about a Muslim friend’s harrowing Snapchat story—a black backdrop with the caption: “No room in my schedule to cry.” And another Muslim friend’s status lamenting the Islamaphobes who violently interrupted a meeting at her hometown mosque in Virginia.
I’m talking about the Yale email and the cries of “coddled liberal students” that followed it, and the hate crimes at HLS that seemed to validate its Royall legacy.
I’m talking about a fellow Crimson columnist’s Facebook post about her SLS professor’s last lecture on how black students are genetically inferior. And another columnist’s explanation of why she has become, and remains, a Tired Old Queen.
The utilitarian in me worries that these statuses and posts and columns become trite after a while. They’re all expressions of an exhaustion that we inherit like a stubborn chromosome and will probably pass down, in turn, to our children. And while the same few share our work and like them and reflect on them, the rest still whisper about us damned SJWs in dining halls and raise their hands in seminar to bullshit a comment about intersectionality as if the term is an abstraction meant to validate one’s intellect than a facet of someone’s identity.
So, what’s the point?
*****
“So we cameAnd Harvard knewAll we came forWas what was dueOur forty acresAnd that mule.”—Fred D. Smith ’73, Harvard College 1973 Yearbook
“As a black student and person, I have learned that Harvard is a place of survival more than sublimity.” — Abraham Penn Jones ’74, Harvard College 1974 Yearbook
“Set my teeth on edge  The Empire is dead The colonies dying As my song toasts Them on my see—saw-see—sawMoving between my selves unevenI am all these made woman.”—Anonymous, Of Woven Strands, 1985
“I like to spell ‘Asian American’ without a hyphen. Hyphenated, 'Asian-American' implies a conflict between equal halves. With the removal of the hyphen, the term becomes a base noun with a modifier instead of a compound noun; the ‘Asian’ part is made subordinate to the ‘American’. I feel that this point of grammar is worth fussing about, for Asian American history and literature has been dominated by an overblown perception of ‘alienness.’ By reading, we are able to learn the hyphenated past of mistaken identity, but only through writing, can we begin to envision a different future.”—Julie Koo, “Word Warriors: The Text and Asian American Identity,” Of Woven Strands, 1985
*****
For his journalism workshop, an acquaintance is writing about the Muslim experience at Harvard. He asks to interview me. We grab trays stacked with various food groups—bowls of Marshmallow Maties and soup and spaghetti steeped in sauce, plates of grilled chicken and cucumbers and waffles—minutes before the dining hall closes.
I swirl my spoon around in circles as he asks questions.
“Is your Muslim identity ever at odds with your South Asian one? Have you ever faced discrimination, either by peers or professors, following terrorist attacks? Have you ever had to explain the actions of ISIS to your friends?”
I stop him with a raised hand and feel the urge to loudly scream, shattering the glass barriers separating the upper level of Pfoho’s dhall from the bottom. He blinks in response.
“What it is like being a Muslim here?”
I exhale, my voice softer than I intend, barely audible, belying a kind of dull ache that had, for so long, throbbed.
“Hard.”
He writes my comment down, dutiful reporter that he is. And I write comments down, too, after he leaves, filling the margins of my comp lit notebook with shitty verses better suited for my angsty middle school days.
“Instead of taking a dose of this / Or popping a pill of that / You tell me to search within/And I’ll find something worth looking at.”
*****
After she got famous for reporting on hippies in San Francisco, Joan Didion wrote an essay called, “Why I Write." It’s self-reflexive, as one might expect. She stole the title from George Orwell, and the reason for her theft, she explains, is the assonance. “There you have three short unambiguous words that share a sound.” The sound they share, she continues, is “the act of saying ‘I.'”
My mom is a selfless person by nature and a doctor by practice. The act of saying "I" or focusing on herself seems contrarian at best and heinous at worst. When she realized that I wasn’t going to be pre-med—that literature fulfilled me more than bio or chem—she wrapped me in her arms. “Write as if you’re saving someone’s life,” she said.
Ask me why I write and I’ll tell you that I write to find out what I’m thinking, to release and expunge feelings, to find what it is that I see in my head—what I want, what I fear. I don’t intuitively think about a "you" or a "they," or even a "we." Maybe, I’m beginning to realize, it’s okay that I write to save only a single life, that I write to save my own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Graduate School of Design raised just about $7 million in its segment of the University’s ongoing capital campaign in the 13 months following the launch of its public phase in September of last year.
Although the $76.2 million that the school had raised as of Oct. 31 represents about 69 percent of its total campaign goal of $110 million, it puts the fundraising drive on a significantly slower pace compared to many other schools and Harvard as a whole, which is fast approaching its overall goal of $6.5 billion.
Between the school’s public launch in September 2014, when it had already raised more than $69 million, and late February, the Design School raised a little more than $1 million. Its fundraising has quickened since then, to about $6 million between the ends of February and October, meaning the school has raised a monthly average of about $750,000 in that time. 
Harvard’s capital campaign is slated to conclude in 2018, so the Design School will need to raise more than $750,000 per month on average to meet its goal by that time. Still, school fundraisers were optimistic about the campaign’s progress in a recent interview.
“We’re feeling pretty good, to be quite honest,” said John K. F. Irving ’83, one of the Design School campaign’s co-chairs, suggesting that the school has gained traction with alumni and other donors.
According to Brad Quigley, the Design School’s director of alumni programs, the school’s alumni participation rate for annual giving increased to 9.8 percent in the 2015 fiscal year from 9.4 percent the year before. The school’s target is 15 percent alumni participation by the end of the campaign.
Eighty percent of the school’s donors have made gifts of less than $100 each, Quigley said.
The Design School’s alumni base is limited in its ability to make large donations, according to school administrators, because graduates often earn smaller salaries than alumni of Harvard Business School and others.
“Alumni with a background in design don’t always have numerous opportunities...to make large donations,” Design School Dean Mohsen Mostafavi said in March.
The Design School has raised about 30 percent of its fundraising goal for financial aid, one of the campaign’s priorities, according to Irving, who called it a “bit of a challenging area” for graduate schools compared to the College.
“Many people would view people who’ve attended graduate schools as [if] they’ve had jobs or getting jobs, going on to other things,” Irving added, suggesting that donors may not immediately think graduate students need as much aid as undergraduates.
Still, the Design School is trying to push financial aid heavily at this point in the campaign, given the amount of debt its students accrue. Roughly 90 percent of students there receive financial aid, and the average grant is $18,500, according to Kevin Derrick, a school spokesperson.
Sixty-seven percent of the school’s financial aid budget comes from its operating budget, the highest proportion of any of Harvard’s schools, according to Beth Kramer, the Design School’s associate dean for development and alumni relations.
With regards to financial aid, Kramer said, the school feels “this kind of moral responsibility of how much debt the students take on here, and [that] they take on more debt than any of the other schools at Harvard.”
As for other campaign priorities, according to Irving and Kramer, $30 million will go toward student experience initiatives including financial aid; $30 million will support “enhancing global impact” through research, pedagogy, and studios; about $20 million will go to endowing faculty chairs and programs; and about $30 million will fund upgrades to school facilities, including the addition of a research facility to Gund Hall and upgrades to the school’s libraries.
Irving described the library upgrades as a “slightly more complicated issue, perhaps, than it is for what people would traditionally think of in a library.”
“The library question at the GSD, for example, not just includes books, but it has to include drawings, in fact there’s materials libraries where you can go in and see various samples,” Irving said.
Planning work is already underway on the research addition to Gund Hall, according to Irving, as are other expansions to the campus, such as the creation of a Center for Green Buildings and Cities and the expansion into properties such as 7 Sumner Rd.

As dozens of teams at the Harvard Innovation Lab tackle contemporary challenges with their entrepreneurial projects, Confi and Antera Therapeutics stand out in the field of medicine. 
Founded this past summer at the i-Lab, Confi serves as an online platform that crowdsources advice on sexual health targeted at women and works in tandem with medical experts to shed light on topics some might consider too taboo to ask about.
“Our goal when creating Confi is that there was really no one resource for people when they have questions about sexual health,” said Kristen Y. Shim ’17, a member of Confi’s four-woman team. "People usually go to online forums for information, and that’s not reliable information, and it’s often very sexist.”
According to Confi CEO and Harvard Business School student Tess D. Brooks, studies conducted by the company have shown that women often feel uncomfortable buying sexual health products at pharmacies or at online vendors like Amazon. In response, Confi plans to sell feminine sexual health “starter kits,” featuring an assortment of condoms, lubricants, and pregnancy tests. Shim said Confi will test this profit-generating model in the spring.
For Confi, increasing the number of online users, having seen its web traffic increase by 60 percent over the past quarter, and finding sources of revenue are top priorities, Brooks said. While Confi will soon test the viability of selling feminine health products as a method of generating profit, Confi may also begin to approach corporate sponsors.
Another team, Antera, founded in December 2014, is looking to become the leading expert in vaccination against food and environmental allergens. The company focuses on reducing the prevalence of peanut allergies, which have increased threefold in the United States since 2004, according to founder and CEO Clarence D. Friedman. The startup is “disrupting the model of healthcare,” by targeting allergen tolerance from a preventative standpoint, added Friedman, a 2015 Business School graduate.
Antera’s current product, Aralyte, is a concentrated dosage of peanut protein given to children from infancy to expose them to the potential allergen. While unique, this approach to allergies is supported by contemporary research in the field, according to Friedman. He added that a February 2015 study on early prevention of peanut allergies conducted by the Immune Tolerance Network supported the company’s claims.
“In the future we’ll expand to the other allergens that account for 95 percent of food allergies such as tree nuts, shellfish, soy, and wheat,” Friedman said, adding that the company will continue beta-testing Aralyte for another four months. “We’d really like to go to environmental allergies too. We really want to become the company that vaccinates against all allergies.”
Approaching allergies from this perspective comes with its own set of challenges, said Friedman and Caroline L. Sokol, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and a member of Antera’s scientific advisory board.
Because of the potential for an adverse reaction to the peanut protein, a physician administers the first dose, while parents administer the subsequent doses. According to Sokol, this process will require some testing.
“It is not a common method of administering medication,” she said. “You have parents out there who, if there has been a family history of peanut allergies, are nervous about giving that first dose of a potential allergen to their kid.”
Friedman pointed to having access to resources and a network of entrepreneurs through the i-Lab as pivotal to his company’s success.
“It’s a nice little circle where everyone is helping each other out, and it’s been an incubator in the best sense of the word,” Friedman said. “We have grown extremely quickly due to the people around.”

The Harvard Extension Environmental Club screened “The True Cost,” a documentary that describes environmental and humans costs of the clothing industry, and hosted a follow-up panel discussion on Friday evening.
Pointing to the emergence of the “fast fashion industry,” referring to the quick and inexpensive manufacturing of trendy designs for consumers to buy at an affordable price, organizers said they hoped to prompt attendees to consider the hidden cost of consumerism when standing in the checkout line at retailers like H&M and Zara.
“Fashion is actually the second largest contributor to environmental pollution after the oil industry,” said Lacey Klingensmith, a student at the Harvard Extension School and the vice president of the the club.
Shot in13 countries, including Bangladesh and India, the documentary featured interviews with fashion designers like Stella McCartney, factory workers and owners, labor activists, academic experts on consumption and sustainability, and farmers.
After the documentary screening, several panelists addressed how consumers can minimize their fashion environmental footprint.
One of the panelists, Bonnie Siefers, the CEO of eco-fashion brand Jonano, urged attendees to go to their closets and pick out just five items and wear only those items for one month.
“I took this challenge, and what I discovered about myself is that I really don’t need most of the stuff that I have in my closet,” Siefers said.
Panelist Sara Ziff, a student at the Kennedy School of Government and the founder and executive director of Model Alliance, a nonprofit labor group for models working in the United States, discussed a documentary on garment workers living in Bangladesh that she is currently producing.
“How can I be doing this work …. and have so little understanding of the garment workers that make the clothes that we wear?” Ziff said, adding that she visited Bangladesh to get a firsthand look at the working conditions of the garment workers there.
“Garment workers are invisible to us in this process,” she said.
Northeastern student Bashair Al Hinai was drawn to the event because of her interest in the fashion industry.
“It’s so easy for us to forget that a human made what we are wearing,” she said. “As soon as we forget that, we lose understanding... We have to acknowledge what happened to get these items to the shelves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most Harvard seniors edit, toil over, and finally turn in their theses in a communal flurry in the weeks leading up to spring break and Housing Day each spring. But for the College’s off-cycle seniors, the affair is less standardized and a bit more lonely, they say.
Though off-cycle deadlines—which affect seniors who take time off and complete their eighth semester during the fall term—vary by department, most fall sometime around November each year.
For Alice W. Zhao ’14-’16, a joint concentrator in Statistics and Mathematics and a former Crimson business associate, the formal thesis-writing process was the same as for her on-cycle counterparts, but she said other aspects were different.
In the spring, many professors assume that the seniors in their classes are writing theses and proactively grant extensions for assignments. But in the fall, professors do not readily assume that students in their classes are facing impending thesis deadlines, Zhao said.
For Zhao, the biggest difference, though, was that “not everyone around you is writing a thesis—that’s a pretty big deal,” she said.
Her thesis adviser, Statistics professor David P. Harrington, said Zhao’s off-cycle writing experience was not to her disadvantage and that during the summer, he and Zhao “probably met as often by phone and over Skype as we would have met during the semester.”
Zhao also benefited because “she got her project in spring term, so she had summer to continue to work on,” Harrington said. “The thesis was better shaped, and she knew where it was headed.”
The advantages of writing off-cycle are even greater because there are fewer students in the final stages of thesis-writing, Yoav B. Schaefer ’15-’16 said.
Schaefer, a Social Studies concentrator with a focus on German philosophy, turned in his thesis a few days before his Nov. 2 deadline. His thesis “focused in particular on a number of German-Jewish philosophers in the 20th century in the period between the World Wars,” he said.
“In some ways, I could not have written the thesis that I wrote had I been writing it over the academic year; I took on a much bigger project than I would have been able to write over two semesters,” Schaefer said.
Because he was writing off-cycle, he said, he had an extra summer, traditionally a crucial time that many seniors set aside to work on major portions of their theses.
“I had two summers—generally you use a summer for research and then write over the academic year. I had two, so I researched last summer,” Schaefer said. “I was in Jerusalem doing research there, and then I had this summer to write.”
The Committee on Social Studies, he said, was also accommodating. “My adviser was very accessible over the summer, which I think is not always the case,” Schafer said.
For her part, Christina A. Nguyen ’15-’16, who also wrote an off-cycle thesis, said there were not major differences between writing a thesis on-cycle and writing one off-cycle since “the project in itself is an independent undertaking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council discussed a change to its Finance Committee’s rules for funding student groups on Sunday—a policy representatives hope will help prevent sexual assault on campus.
A draft of the policy that representatives discussed on Sunday looks to incentivize student group participation in sexual assault training. Specifically, student groups whose members attend training workshops with Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response or with the peer counseling group Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators would be eligible for financial incentives through the Council’s grants process.
At least half of student group members would need to attend the training workshops for the group to receive the proposed benefits.
Following the recent release of survey results that detailed an incidence of sexual assault at Harvard that administrators deemed “troubling,” sexual assault prevention was an issue at the forefront of the UC’s presidential elections. Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17, who were named the Council’s president-elect and vice president-elect on Thursday, vowed in their campaign to implement a sexual assault bystander intervention program and advocate for Harvard to adopt an explicit affirmative consent policy. The Council also voted last week to give a four-pronged set of recommendations to one of the University’s task forces on sexual assault prevention.
One losing UC leadership ticket—William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17—had campaigned on creating financial incentives for student groups to attend sexual assault training workshops.
The version of the policy changes presented at the Council’s general meeting on Sunday, authored by the Finance Committee, is a draft. Representatives will detail proposed funding incentives in the coming weeks and intend for them to go into effect next semester.
Other than sexual assault prevention, debate about undergraduate social spaces and whether or not Harvard should provide more of them dominated this year’s election season. A failed referendum sponsored by the UC sought to transform Pusey Library into a social space.
In other business, the UC voted at the meeting on Sunday to create a “party rental kit” service for students. The party kits will include tables and ping pong balls for beer pong, as well as speakers and cups. Representatives said the service looks to make it easier for students to create their own social spaces.
Jullian A. Duran ’18, a Leverett House representative and one of the proposal’s sponsors, said administrators had criticized the proposal on the grounds that it would implicitly encourage students to participate in drinking games. Duran said he has spoken with some student Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, though, who were supportive of the idea.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two sisters, novelist Kaitlyn Greenidge and playwright Kirsten Greenidge, spoke about weaving historical and personal influences into their fiction at the Harvard Book Store on Friday evening.
Both read excerpts of their work at the event, co-sponsored by Transition magazine of Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, before discussing the process of crafting pieces of historical fiction.
“I do feel like I have an obligation to the past,” Kaitlyn said. “I’ve had so many conversations with people from all walks of life about history, particularly black history.”
She described these conversations as sometimes strange and disturbing, and other times hopeful, but said that she wants to remain a part of these conversations.
The writers described how the amount of information involved in a particular historical moment can become overwhelming. They also discussed how best to achieve a balance between history and fiction in a piece.
“When it feels like you are writing a history paper, it is time to scale down,” Kirsten said.
She added that she is influenced by historical research as well as by her personal experiences. “I draw from parts of my life and parts of my family history,” she said.
The two spoke about their dynamic as a family of sisters who write creatively, referring to their third sister, who also writes.
“I get pure inspiration from how my sisters work,” Kirsten said. “It’s great to be in that close proximity with other writers and not feel that competition.”
When asked by an audience member to offer advice for aspiring young writers, they both emphasized the importance of finding a good “writers’ group” to provide constructive criticism and of consistently practicing your craft.
“I think that they are both clearly so intelligent in their separate fields of fiction,” said Matt T. Macca, one of Kirsten’s playwriting students at Boston University who attended the event. “It is really inspiring to hear two writers who are so strong in their voices and to see them interact.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Closing to a standing ovation, the Children of the Light trio performed for a packed crowd in Sanders Theatre on Friday night.
Composed of pianist Danilo Pérez, bassist John Patitucci, and drummer Brian Blade, the trio previously belonged to the Wayne Shorter Quartet, a Grammy award-winning jazz ensemble, before it disbanded in 2014. According to the concert program, the trio’s name is a play on a song by Shorter called, “Children of the Night.” Their performance was part of the Celebrity Series of Boston, which brings world-renowned performers to venues in and around Boston.
Joey Alexander, a 12-year-old jazz pianist prodigy hailing from Indonesia, opened for the group. Alexander has previously performed for former President Bill Clinton and as part of a jazz performance headed by renowned jazz musician Wynton Marsalis at the Lincoln Center.
“It’s always incredible to see someone...who is so young and can play so well, but he’s also a phenomenal musician,” said Jack C. Wright, director of marketing and communications for the Celebrity Series of Boston.
Alexander played a total of four selections, three of which were arrangements of songs by well-known jazz composers. He composed the first piece himself.
“Composing the song took time,” Alexander said, adding that Friday’s concert marked his first time performing solo. “One of my inspirations was church music, gospel, and a little bit of waltz.”
Following Alexander, Pérez plucked the piano wires and bantered with the rest of the trio throughout the Children of the Light performance, pointing to the group’s quirky and unique style. Later, Patitucci, after struggling to find his music in the middle of a number, sheepishly grinned, eliciting laughter from the audience.
This style of performance appealed to several audience members.
“I think it was really wonderful to see the interplay between the group, and I was thinking how they probably never play the same song the same way all the time,” said Charles B. McWhorter, a Cambridge resident.

UPDATED: November 25, 2015, at 10:44 p.m.
Five Harvard undergraduates are recipients of the 2016 Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford, up three from last year when two Harvard students won the prestigious award, the Rhodes Trust announced on Saturday.
The winners—Grace E. Huckins, Garrett M. Lam, Neil M. Alacha, Rivka B. Hyland, and Hassaan Shahawy, all members of the class of 2016—said Sunday that they greeted the news with a mix of elation and shock. And according to Shahawy, the finalists in his district were all together in one room when they found out that they had received the Rhodes—or if they hadn’t.
“We were in the L.A. Public Library, talking and playing card games for three hours,” he said. “And then [an interviewer] came out, called us into the room—we were standing in a circle and they announced to us the names of the winners.”
For her part, Hyland, who lives in Lowell House, said the anxious hours that separated the interview and the announcement of results were positive.
“We had conversations in which I changed my mind about things and developed new ideas and saw them doing the same,” she said. “There’s never going to be another experience like that.”
Two of the winners, Huckins and Lam, are Crimson editors, and both study Neurobiology as part of joint concentrations. Hyland and Shahawy both study Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, and Alacha is a Social Studies concentrator.
Alacha and Lam both said they had researched extensively while at Harvard, experiences they said were helpful to them while applying for the Rhodes and other fellowships.
The Rhodes, which covers the cost of attending the University of Oxford for two or three academic years, is granted to students who demonstrate “high academic achievement, personal integrity, and leadership potential, among other attributes,” according to the scholarship’s website.
For Huckins, who is chair of The Crimson’s Arts board, word of her selection caused “utter disbelief.” She said she “scarcely believed it was real—it still hasn’t set in.”
“Now that I don’t have to worry about graduate school, I will be focusing on my thesis and try as much as I can to enjoy my last several months here,” Huckins said. “I’ve worked pretty hard while at Harvard, so my time here has gone by incredibly quickly.”
Shahawy, a resident of Mather House, similarly said his reaction included an element of disbelief. He also felt somewhat guilty for his good fortune.
“I felt happy, but then this impending sense of responsibility,” he said. “This is something I was hoping so strongly for, but there are other many people who lack the basic necessities: food, water, finding somewhere to sleep, finding somewhere safe.”
Harvard seniors make up five of the 32 Americans chosen as the newest Rhodes Scholars, the largest number from any one institution. Princeton has four Rhodes Scholars, followed by Yale, which has three.

CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—In a sloppy performance at Conte Forum, the Harvard men’s basketball team (1-3) lost its third consecutive contest Sunday afternoon, 69-56, to crosstown rival Boston College (3-0). The Crimson made just nine of its 23 free throws and turned the ball over 16 times, while allowing the Eagles to shoot 50 percent in a 53-point second half. It was the first time Harvard has lost three straight since February of 2009.
“For us to have a chance in a game like this, we have to be much better in areas like foul shooting,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was disappointed that we didn’t put forth better effort there on the little things that are necessary to win a game like this.”
The Crimson struggled out of the gate, ceding the first eight points of the game. By the first media timeout, Harvard had yet to score.
In the next 15 minutes, however, the Crimson would hold their opponents to just eight total points. Eagles star guard Eli Carter was blanketed by senior Agunwa Okolie, with Carter missing the six shots he took in the first 20 minutes.
Despite making just one of its six first half free throws, the Crimson entered the break up four, as the group held Boston College to just 24 percent shooting.
The second half could not have been more different.
While Harvard shot the ball well after the break—making half of its shots and four of its 10 threes—every basket was seemingly answered by two from the Eagles. Boston College made seven threes in the second half—many uncontested—and 22 of 27 free throws.
The 53 points that the Crimson gave up in the 20 minutes was more than an opponent scored against Harvard in four full games last year. Carter had 15 points in the half, with freshman reserve Matt Milon adding 16 for the game, including four made shots from beyond the arc.
“They are a solid basketball team, and in the second half in particular, they got their offense flowing and shot the ball well from three,” Amaker said.
Offensively, the Crimson failed to get into a rhythm for majority of the game. Harvard made seven threes but just 13 two-point baskets. While junior Edosomwan paced the team with 20 points and nine rebounds, the forward shot eight-for-18 and missed five of his nine free throws.
It was the turnovers, however, that turned the tenor of the game. Freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy was up and down all afternoon, finishing with a career-high 13 points but to go along with five turnovers and no assists. Carter twice took the ball from McCarthy at the top of the key, turning the live-ball turnovers into points on the other end. Boston College had just two fast break points but routinely found open shooters in transition.
McCarthy’s struggles with the ball were characteristic of a team that had just 12 assists on the day. Through four games, the Crimson is averaging three more turnovers than assists per game and shooting just over 40 percent from the field.
“[McCarthy]’s been thrown into the deep end right away with the schedule we’ve had to play and the matchups he’s had to go against,” Amaker said. “It is a process for a young player, and we have to keep his spirits right and his head up and keep grinding away. He has ability, and we think that he is going to get better.”
Edosomwan continued to be a bright spot for Harvard’s offense. The junior set a career high with 20 points, the second consecutive game he has set a career high in that category. Down the stretch, Harvard continued to feed the big man on every possession as he drew foul after foul on the Eagles’ set of big men—Dennis Clifford, Idy Diallo, and Johncarlos Reyes—who combined for six points to 11 fouls.
“Coach [Amaker] has been telling me as you continue to improve and learn you are going to expect the double teams, [with] the different guys being thrown at you, so you have to learn and continue to grow,” Edosomwan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year’s Ivy League championship was bittersweet for the Harvard women’s volleyball team. After earning a share of the title, the team lost in straight sets to archrival Yale in the tiebreaking game that decided the Ancient Eight’s NCAA tournament.
But this year’s Crimson championship takes the cake, in all its sweetness.
While Harvard students filed down to New Haven for the 132th rendition of The Game, the women’s volleyball team stayed behind Friday night at the Malkin Athletic Center to take down Princeton, 3-1, to end the Tigers’ season and send the Crimson to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history.
“It feels amazing, honestly,” senior Kathleen Wallace said. “I think now it’s finally setting in. In the moment I was in shock.”
The last set of the game was perhaps the Crimson’s most tightly contested of the season. Harvard forced 13 ties in the set, despite only holding the lead during three points, all of which only lasted a point each. With the game tied at 23 points apiece, junior setter Corie Bain delivered the last of her team-high 15 kills on the night, giving the Crimson a one-point lead. One Tiger attack error later, and the Crimson had punched its ticket to the NCAA Tournament.
Princeton was the first team to grab momentum, as the Tigers came storming out of the gates hot. Princeton won its first three points and rode an 8-3 run to get out to an 18-10 lead that the Tigers would not let slip away. Junior outside hitter Cara Mattaliano led the way for Princeton with five kills in the set, part of her game-high 22.
Mattaliano, however, did so on 54 attacks and 10 errors, leaving her attacking percentage at 22 percent.
“We played the middle too loose,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. We didn’t expect to have them come out firing. We knew after that that it was going to be battle and that we were going to have to outwork them.”
The Crimson’s performance in the second set stole that momentum from the Tigers. While the first half of the set saw the teams trade runs, Harvard found a second gear, churning out a 12-4 run to end the set and even the game up a one set apiece headed into the break.
“We did lose last year and that chip was still on our shoulder,” Wallace said. “We had come so close to where we wanted to finish…. It was a motivating factor to actually finish what we started this year. That was the major difference this year.”
The tiebreaker took on a much different tone than last season’s version, which featured the MAC at full capacity and strong showings from fan bases from both Harvard and Yale. This year saw a smaller crowd, an environment in front of which the team was more accustomed to playing.
“Last year we didn’t really know what to expect,” Holte said. “We came in a little more nervous. This year, we focused in the week prior and scouted really well.”
Bain and Wallace would lead the charge for the Crimson over the next two sets. Wallace finished one kill short of Bain on the night, finishing with double-digit kills for the fourth game in a row and for the ninth time in ten games. Meanwhile, the Manhattan Beach, Calif., native notched her seventh triple-double on the year.
Harvard was aided by the Tigers’ increasingly sloppy pay throughout the game. After only recording three errors in the first set, Princeton would go on to average just shy of nine in the remaining three sets, including 11 in the fourth set which the Tigers needed to win to force a fifth set in the tiebreaker game.
The win extends the season for the Crimson, who still awaits its opponent in the first round of the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—This Saturday in New Haven, Harvard football clinched its first ever Ivy League three-peat by trouncing Yale, 38-19, in the 132nd playing of The Game. The result marked a program-record ninth straight victory over the Bulldogs and sent off the class of 2016 with a career record of 36-4, tied for the highest winning percentage in school history.
BULLDOGS GET THE CLAMP
Earlier this season, the Harvard defense put together what was likely its most dominant stretch in the past four years—a period of 212:30 without a touchdown.
Mathematically it is impossible to put together as impressive a stretch during 60 minutes of play, but on Saturday the Crimson came pretty close.
After conceding a touchdown on the opening drive, Harvard went 42 minutes without allowing another score. In that period, the scoreboard transformed from a 7-0 deficit to a 31-7 lead, and the Yale student section transformed from loud and packed to quiet and near-empty.
“We didn’t change anything,” captain Matt Koran said. “We just got back to our fundamental defense—just fly around making plays.”
Over the afternoon, the Crimson limited the Bulldogs to 34 yards on the ground. And when late-down yardage forced Yale to throw, the hosts hardly had more success, going 5-for-18 on third-down conversions.
As a result, Harvard forced the Bulldogs into three-and-outs on four of five consecutive drives during the first and second quarter. Over the course of this stretch, the defense conceded a total of 28 yards.
Meanwhile, all six of the top tacklers for the Crimson were seniors. Linebackers Jacob Lindsey and Eric Medes led the squad with 11 and 8 tackles, respectively.
But the production came from all corners of the defense. In the secondary, all four starters—seniors Sean Ahern, Scott Peters, Chris Evans, and Asante Gibson—recorded at least one broken-up pass in the victory.
“The thing that’s most special is that it’s our first three-peat in Harvard history,” Koran said. “We got the job done, and it was an awesome ride.”
AGE OF JUSTICE
Earlier this season, when College Sports Madness named freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley the Preseason National Freshman Player of the Year, the selection might have raised a few eyebrows.
Sure, the sinewy rookie had entertained offers from stalwarts like Washington and California, but he was entering a Harvard system that rarely privileged freshman with significant playing time. Moreover, he would be competing for catches with an experienced attack—one that returned seven of eight leading receivers.
Ten games and 589 receiving yards later, these eyebrows remain raised—but for a different reason. From catch-and-run touchdowns to punt returns, Shelton-Mosley has repeatedly outraced the Ancient Eight, and the rookie serves as a source of future production as the Crimson heads into the offseason.
“He’s a very special athlete and a very, very special person,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I think our upperclassmen are amazed because he acts like a junior.”
More immediately, this Saturday he headlined the Harvard attack, scoring the first two touchdowns of the game en route to a performance that included 119 receiving yards and three touchdowns.
The first score, coming less than five minutes into the first quarter, was the most crucial. After Yale opened up play with a four-minute scoring drive, the Crimson faced a third-and-nine on its 47-yard line and the possibility of a deflating three-and-out.
Instead, Shelton-Mosley skinned his defender, racing behind the secondary and grabbing a 53-yard bomb in the end zone. The catch tied the game and predictably energized the Harvard crowd, which went from silence to hysterics.
But the freshman had only begun. Early in the second quarter, he showed his elusiveness with a 35-yard juke-and-go that ended with a left-pylon score.
He also added an 8-yard end-around with less than six minutes left in the game.
ONE DOWN, THREE UP
From shutdown defense to electrifying offense, this Saturday seemed to showcase all elements of the Crimson’s success over the past four years—well, all elements except senior running back Paul Stanton.
Sidelined by a season-ending knee injury that he suffered against Penn, Harvard’s top rusher watched from the bench as teammates zipped up and down the field.
The afternoon of inactivity made for an incongruous end to one of the most illustrious rushing careers in school history. Over four years, Stanton tallied 2,906 yards and 36 touchdowns, the latter of which is second-most in school history.
But as the saying goes: one man down, three men up. In Stanton’s absence, Harvard found productivity in the trio of senior quarterback Scott Hosch and the two Smith brothers, senior wide receiver Seitu and sophomore running back Semar.
“Really impressed and really happy for the Smith brothers to be able to play together in the backfield,” Murphy said. “Our resiliency, our conviction—those intangibles have been the trademark of this team, and that’s exactly what it took.”
Although the Smith brothers took designed handoffs, tallying 53 yard apiece, Hosch finished as the leading runner with 60 yards.
And while none of the three rushers scored a touchdown on the ground, the trio proved especially valuable in chewing up clock late in the game, as Harvard took up seven minutes on a mid-fourth-quarter scoring drive, all but squashing the Bulldogs’ hopes for a comeback.
“It was just one of those nights where we seemed to just feed on this goal,” Murphy said. “Just one of those nights where everybody played probably as well as they could.”

The No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team brought the excitement and energy to the Murr Center in its season opener, defeating No. 9 Stanford, 8-1, for the 11th-straight time at the Boston Round-Robins.
Last weekend, the defending champions dropped a hard fought match in the finals of the Ivy League scrimmages to Yale on the road. As it returned home to open its 2015-2016 season on Friday, the Crimson (1-0) looked to rebound and start off the season on the right footing.
“Not specifically preparing for Stanford but more for the season as a whole, we’ve been doing a lot of mental work and fitness,” junior Katherine Tutrone said. “ [Coach] Mike [Way] loves playing the life coach for us, keeping us humored and constantly aware of why we do what we do.”
All of the encouragement from Way after the scrimmages seems to paid off. The team was comfortable and confident going into the match, not only because it was at home but also because it was playing a team that it had already had 10 consecutive wins.
Past results are not indicative of future game performances, though, and the Crimson still anticipated a tough game.
“Stanford is always a very solid team, and we went in knowing there were some tough players, especially at the top of their lineup,” co-captain Isabelle Dowling said. “They proved to be very strong, and it was a great match.”
Going into the match with the mindset that it couldn’t slack off helped the Crimson play at a high level and easily handle the Cardinals (2-1). Specifically, the newest members of the team quickly acclimated to the style and level of play that is expected of a Harvard women’s squash player.
“The freshmen have been awesome so far,” Dowling said. “They are all also very seasoned players with international and world team experience, so we are very confident they will continue to succeed throughout the year. They have brought a fantastic energy to the team as well that we have been enjoying.”
It was a big day for two of the freshmen, Kayley Leonard and Sophie Mehta, who made their collegiate debuts.
Leonard played in the No. 1 position and defeated Madeleine Gill 3-1. Mehta, playing in the sixth position, clinched her first win with a 3-0 sweep of Anna Marie Manning.
Junior Caroline Monrad had the closest match of the day, dropping two games to Lucy Rowe playing out of the eighth spot on her way to a 3-2 win.
In the second position, sophomore Alyssa Mehta made winning a family affair. She also defeated her opponent, Sarah Bell, in four games. Dowling, Tutrone, junior Dileas MacGowan, and sophomore Sue Ann Yong also soundly won their sets, with three of the four sweeping their opponents.
MacGowan remains undefeated in her Crimson career, and Dowling picked up her seventh career win.
The only matchup dropped was junior Keegan Mendez’s, who lost by 3 close games to Grayson Melby.
While all nine Crimson players had solid performances, the team is just beginning to heat up and still has room to improve on its road to clinching another national title.
“We all have individual lists of things that we are constantly working on—be it serve returns, movement to the front of the court, or our short games,” Tutrone said. “While there isn’t one uniform thing across the team, I’m sure everyone will be taking away some things from this match to apply to the games going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backup Harvard point guard Matt Fraschilla is out for the year with a torn ACL, the junior announced Tuesday on Instagram.
Fraschilla, the team’s third option at the position behind classmate Corbin Miller and freshman starter Tommy McCarthy, played just one minute in Providence before getting caught in a collision near half court. The junior left the game immediately, walking off the court on his own, and came back to the court with ice bags on his knees. Fraschilla did not play in Tuesday’s 67-61 loss to UMass, and posted later that night announcing his injury.
“Just wanted to update everyone on my situation at the moment so this is the easiest way,” Fraschilla wrote. “On Saturday night during our game at Providence, I had a hard collision and after the tests came back today, I found I tore my ACL and will miss the rest of the year. It’s a tough blow to find this out after working towards this opportunity but I’ll be alright.”
Fraschilla has played just 77 minutes in his Harvard career, making four field goals. In the team’s first three halves since he was injured, Miller and McCarthy played every minute at the point, with sophomore guard Andre Chatfield and freshman guard Corey Johnson accompanying them on the wing.
The Harvard Athletic Department had no comment on the injury.

Harvard swimmers broke two records at Columbia’s Uris Pool on Friday, and the Crimson went on to record a convincing 220-79 win over the Lions (1-3, 1-2 Ivy).
In Harvard’s (4-0, 3-0) fourth meet of the year, its swimmers took first place in every event. Sophomore David Pfeifer placed second in both the one meter and three meter diving events.
“I think the team did really well on Friday,” junior Paul O’Hara said. “We had a couple of really good individual performances. A lot of us were tired after the travel, but I think that we really pulled together and did a great job.”
Facing Columbia on the road was a challenge with which the Crimson had struggled in the past, but this year the team was able to overcome the Lions in their home pool.
“We went into the meet with the knowledge that Columbia always performs well at home,” senior Leo Lim said. “The last time we swam against them at Columbia, they gave us a challenge, and we struggled the first half of the meet. However, for this whole meet, we did a great job staying focused from the first half and got the job done.”
Sophomore Koya Osada set a pool record in the 200 backstroke with a time of 1:45.77, and two of his teammates rounded out the top three in the same event as well. Senior Christian Yeager and junior Jack Manchester finished second and third, respectively. Osada’s time was the eighteenth fastest in the NCAA and the fastest in the Ivy League this year.
“[Osada] swam really, really fast and broke the pool record that was set by another member of our team at this meet our freshman year, Jack Manchester,” O’Hara said. “[The national standing] was really impressive, and we’re all super excited about that.”
The Crimson 200 free relay team also broke a pool record on Friday. The A relay, made up of O’Hara, Tan, junior Max Yakubovich, and freshman Sebastian Lutz, took first place with a time of 1:20.74.
Osada and sophomores Shane McNamara and Steven Tan and O’Hara helped guide Harvard’s A team to a first-place finish in the 200 medley relay with a time of 1:30.22, but were just over a second shy of the pool record of 1:29.16.
“For the medley relay, we ended up not getting the record, but everyone split really fast and the team looks really good going into the rest of the season,” O’Hara said.
While Harvard swimmers did not set pool records in every event, there were still a handful of individual performances that put the meet out of reach for Columbia. The Crimson showed its depth against the Lions, as Harvard swimmers swept the top spots in multiple events.
In the 1000 free, freshmen Logan Houck and Brennan Novak and sophomore Kent Haeffner finished first, second, and third, respectively. Houck touched first with a time of 9:14.13.
Along with winning the distance freestyle events, Harvard won both the 50 and 100 free events, and the Crimson had four swimmers atop the leaderboard in the 50 free. Tan was able to clinch first place in both swims.
The 200 butterfly saw a trio of Harvard swimmers beat out all four of Columbia’s swimmers. Lim led the contingent, closely followed by freshman Justin Wu and senior Jacob Luna.
With two straight dominant wins over Ivy League foes, the Crimson looks to continue to build momentum for the rest of its Ancient Eight matchups.
“Seeing these two wins and really good performances gives us a pretty big confidence boost, and we’ll be ready for whatever Princeton can throw at us,” O’Hara said.

Harvard wrestling returned to action for its second tournament of the season on Sunday at the Keystone Classic at the University of Pennsylvania. While the squad finished seventh on the day, the Crimson saw several wrestlers locked up in matches that came down to the very last second.
“I think we had a lot of guys wrestle really well today,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Jeff Ott and Josef Johnson in particular won bouts in the last second of matches, which showed some real grit. Josef had to really hold on and come back in regulation, and I like to see that kind of stuff where you never quit. That’s something we pride ourselves on, to never be out of the match.”
Johnson managed to clinch a third-place finish at 174 lbs., fighting his way through a handful of gritty matches to reach the semifinal round. After losing his semifinal bout, the sophomore outmaneuvered his opponent—Jacob Davis of Eastern Michigan, to claim a 5-3 victory and earn his spot on the podium.
Ott, a junior, also managed to secure placewinner status. The 133-pounder held off his final opponent of the day—Andy Schultz of Bloomsburg—in a 12-11 standoff for the fifth place spot, notching one of four podium finishes for the Crimson.
“For Jeff to come off his year away and be able to immediately step up like that today was incredible to see,” senior captain Todd Preston said. “He’s a future leader of this program and top guy on the team, and it was really exciting to see.”
Preston provided a strong performance of his own, earning a team-best second place finish. In his first four matches, Preston handily defeated his opponents, earning two technical falls and earning a position in the gold medal match for his weight class at 141 pounds. Pittsburgh’s Mike Racciato outmaneuvered Preston in a tight 3-2 final to claim the gold.
“I made plenty of mistakes that I have to work on going forward, but there were also things that I feel good about,” Preston said. “I’m happy with today, but I’m definitely not content with it. Even if I’d won, I wouldn’t be satisfied this early in the season.”
Several freshmen made their collegiate debut for Harvard at the Classic, with freshmen Nolan Hellickson and Ryan Friedman recording multiple individual wins for the Crimson, at the 125 and 133 weight brackets, respectively.
“They did really well and fought hard,” Weiss said. “With them, I wasn’t so much looking at the outcome of the match, but rather how they compete[d]. They did well—they really battled and showed some heart, which is a huge part of the sport.”
The final place winner for the Crimson was junior Nick Gajdzik, who found himself facing a familiar foe in the heavyweight division, as he faced off against Pittsburgh’s Ryan Solomon. The two were neck and neck throughout the match, but Solomon outlasted Gajdzik 2-1.
“Solomon has been around for years, and he’s been tough competition for us during his career, but Nick was right there with him,” Weiss said. “For him to come back from his year off and do so well against a great opponent was exciting to see, and a great start to the season for him.”
Following the loss to Solomon, Nick Gajdzik bounced back, recording a pin against a Franklin and Marshall heavyweight, and proceeding to outlast Rider’s Mauro Correnti to record a third-place finish on the day.
“I feel the same way I typically feel after a tournament like that,” Weiss said. “There was some good, there was some not so good. I think we definitely saw some room for improvement. There were some top teams there, some really tough competition for us. We’ve just always got to be better than we were last time, and I think we did see some of that today.”

Michael A. Kikukawa ‘17 lives in Lowell and thinks dating in college should be “fun without being overwhelming.” Thomas G. Dumbach ‘18 lives in Kirkland and says he “loves the institution of casual dating and would love for it to make a comeback.” Thomas is in search of someone with a “shameless love of food” and an “understated sense of humor” that dresses well (but isn’t a jerk about it). Michael is looking for someone who has a sense of humor and a passion for something. Did they find these traits in each other over dinner at Spice (paid for by The Crimson)?
Michael: I didn’t want to arrive early because that’s a little eager, but I also didn’t want to arrive too late…my stomach was freaking out.
Thomas: We both arrived at the door at the same time. We quickly realized [who each other were]. We just knew. We just looked and were like, "Hi."
Michael: It was meant to be.
Thomas: [My reaction to seeing him] was positive.
Michael: I was excited… I think we are matched on Tinder. I know we are matched on Tinder. I checked.
Thomas: It was none of the terrible scenarios I had imagined. I had imagined that it would be either someone who, for one reason or another, I just didn’t click with at all or someone I had already hooked up with…it was neither of those things. There are so many people who don’t fit either of those categories, but I was convinced it would just be a nightmare... it wasn’t in spite of my dread.
Michael: [I had] three worries. The first one is I’ve hooked up with this person before and this is going to be the awkward-est thirty minutes of my life. Second is that this person hates me or I hate this person, and the third is that neither finds each other attractive… it was none of those three… I was relieved. He was cute, so it was fun.
Thomas: I ordered the pad ginger and scallion noodles with chicken… He wanted to get basic pad thai, but I was like, "Really, come on." I shamed him into getting a step above.
Michael: I ordered the basic pad thai, but I got it spicy.
Thomas: We talked a good deal about um… wine preferences? He’s mostly white and I’m mostly red except occasionally over the summer when I digress.
Michael: We talked about Long Island for a bit because my roommate is from Long Island and I’m going there for Thanksgiving break…we talked about what interests us…we talked about what we’ve done the past few summers. Nothing about what we do in our free time which was kind of strange. At some point I just got very tired and was probably a bad date and stopped contributing to the conversation a lot and became very invested in my meal.
Thomas: I learned that he was Beyoncé for Halloween.
Michael: [I learned that] he’s taking four classes this semester, which is so normal, but three of them are Latin and Greek and not even Modern Greek, like ancient Greek, and I’m like you are literally the person at Harvard who is more unemployable than me.
Thomas: We talked about the normal things that aren’t particularly memorable but are filler…there was flirting.
Michael: We weren’t [Facebook friends before]. I added him at some point and then very slyly got his number.
Thomas: It was accidental [that he got my number through a group chat with a mutual friend, but] I’ll give him that it was pretty sly.
Michael: We’ve been texting a little bit.
Thomas: I was going to my room [the next night] to watch Gilmore Girls and he [texted] "What are you up to?"
Michael: We saw an episode of Gilmore Girls the next night. It was fun.
Thomas: The future of the relationship… might be best summarized by a Drake song? Hotline Bling…Relationship is to be determined.
Michael: I think that it was fun to get to know someone else. I think a lot of times we get stuck in these sort of circles at Harvard which is great because you have a network of friends and people you can rely on but you forget that there are one thousand other people there that you’ve never met, never talked to… It was helpful that we had friends in common, but that’s true of anyone at Harvard… plus, it’s nice to go on a date. It’s exciting. You get nervous.
Thomas: Hundo P [would recommend going on a Flyby date] mostly because of the free food and also the opportunity for aftermath. Honestly I’d go on so many Flyby dates… can we do a series on me?
No Thomas, we can’t do a series on you because we have a growing list of people who have already applied to go on a Flyby Matchmaker date. Want to join them? Fill out this form and you could have as much fun as Thomas and Michael did.
XOXO,
The Flyby Matchmaker
