After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
There are days when I wake up and reminisce about a time when Carson Daly of TRL would tell me about the galactic set of Britney Spears’s “Oops!..I Did It Again” video. No longer is MTV the only destination for listening parties and anticipated music video premieres. Welcome to the era of iTunes and social media, in which music videos are released like studio films: with multimedia promotional campaigns and million-dollar budgets and press events. These are the artists that are changing the music video game, for better or for worse:
 
1. Miley Cyrus, “We Can’t Stop.”
Miley’s “We Can’t Stop” appears first on this list because I believe in saving the best for last. Cyrus is a mediocre artist at best (her current album has two monster hits, with the rest of the tracks falling through the cracks), but her video was one of the most successful of the year. The video itself was not so great (it felt like the “Garden State” party scene but with a terrible soundtrack and some borrowed “The Big Lebowski” trips), but the campaign behind it is what made it groundbreaking. Weeks leading up to the video’s release, Cyrus overwhelmed Twitter and Facebook with provocative photos accompanied by a “#wecantstop” hashtag and posted videos of herself twerking in a unicorn onesie. This strategy helped the video break records with 10.7 million views on the day of its release alone—a record she broke herself with her next video, “Wrecking Ball,” which received 12.3 million views, also in a day. This strategy and the “We Can’t Stop” video are like a bad car accident: you can’t help but watch.
 
2. Pharrell Williams, “Happy”
The forever-young Pharrell Williams released the first-ever 24-hour music video for “Happy,” a track he wrote for the film “Despicable Me 2.” The video, which you can access at 24hoursofhappy.com, automatically corresponds to the local time of the viewer. The viewer is essentially the director of the video—fast-forwarding and rewinding at his or her discretion, meeting up with Tyler, the Creator, Steve Carell, or Pharrell himself. The video is an interactive masterpiece, bringing together collections of genuinely happy moments from an array of everyday people as well as the occasional celebrity appearance.
 
3. Bob Dylan, “Like A Rolling Stone”
As far as I’m concerned—and many others agree—Dylan’s “Like A Rolling Stone” is one of the greatest songs of all time. And nearly 50 years later, the track finally has an official music video. Dylan’s interactive video uses television as a self-reflexive tool, mimicking the channel-surfing experience as the viewer chooses between 16 “channels,” including but not limited to: a tennis match, “Pawn Stars,” a cooking show, “The Price is Right,” and even a financial news anchor and a bachelor contestant who lip-sync the tune. Despite the eclectic mix of TV hosts and actors that participate, the best part of the video is a clip we know well: a young Dylan—hidden behind his dark locks and military jacket—singing the classic while on tour with the Hawks in 1966.

Art or Not Art?
4. New York City. I'm writing this on my phone as I sit on the upper deck of a bus, somewhere between Penn Station and Central Park. My anxiety is making it hard to forget that the upper deck is often the most dangerous deck of a bus. The city is cold and windy tonight, and few people walk the streets of what looks like an abandoned neighborhood. The woman next to me keeps touching my arm with her arm. Not art.
3. “Evan Almighty.” You have to give Tom Shadyac credit where credit's due. To muster the courage to sequel a mediocre comedy film by replacing Jim Carrey with Steve Carell is bold in itself. Carrey is an iconic figure in both cinematic and standup comedy (and even did a decent, albeit disconcerting, job playing a reticent, sad man in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"), whereas Carell looked most comfortable playing Emma Stone's dad. For a minute, forget the fact that "Evan Almighty" was the most expensive comedy ever made at the time of its debut. Forget the animal abuse controversy and the Rotten Tomato scores. Instead, consider what Picasso's legacy would have been without his daring exploration of Cubism. Imagine if Shostakovich hadn't flown in the face of oppression with his Fifth Symphony. In order to move, an artist must be bold. Shadyac never forgot that before other people proved him right, Galileo was just a crazy man with a telescope. Art.
2. The sculpture in the middle of the Square that they are finally removing. Not art.
1. Your lips. I can see them, thin, reclining parentheses pressed so firmly around the shadow of words, molding them with aching clarity. I tried to find room, fit myself in the cracks of your bitten flesh, but you were too precise to me, excising me with practiced hands. It hurts to pretend. When I am with you, I breathe like I am lighting my last match. When the wind catches your voice and makes it hard to hear you speak, I wish I could think of anything other than how beautiful your lips look when they move. Art.

If last week was some kind of game, Kirkland House junior Samuel B. Clark ’15 beat it. First off, he ran for and was elected Undergraduate Council president. Then, in an almost unprecedented act, he proceeded, alongside vice president-elect Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, to announce his plans for resignation.
 
What may really stand out in Clark’s legacy, however, came the day before, when On Harvard Time released “Harvard Tours Yale: The Game 2013,” a video that instantly took Harvard, the Ivy League, and the whole country by storm.
 
Sometime between the hours of 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Monday, November 26, as I sat down to interview Clark, his viral video reached a new benchmark: one million YouTube views, surpassing (for now) Flyby’s well-known capital of Canada video. Here, Flyby presents the untold story of Clark’s sensational triumph. 
 
BEHIND THE SCENES
 
Within 24 hours of its launching, the video was unavoidable. Emails, postings, and tweets circulated rapidly, and Clark became a walking celebrity.
 
As it turns out, Clark represents only a portion of the brains behind the video. Every year, On Harvard Time produces a “beat Yale” video preceding The Game. This year, the On Harvard Time producers and Clark wanted something a bit different.
 
So, three weekends ago, Clark and five On Harvard Time producers traveled to New Haven and spent an entire day walking around campus, researching historical facts and drafting complimentary jokes for each location.
 
The next morning they were ready.
“Starting at mid-afternoon we started advertising our tours,” Clark said. “We ended up giving three 30-45 minute tours. All of the footage [in the YouTube video] is spliced together from those three tours.”
 
Clark formulated a plan beforehand for countering any concerns from skeptical tour members.
 
“At the beginning, we told people, ‘We’re a completely brand new student led tour group which is why we’re going to have two cameras running this whole time for promotional purposes, so we can get ourselves up off our feet,’” Clark said. 
“We did enough research, we did enough prep work, so that in between the jokes and underhanded jabs at Yale, we had plenty of real facts at every stop,” Clark said. “People didn’t think it was a fake tour. People maybe thought it was a fairly well executed real tour, with a tour guide who was maybe a little quirky and weird and off, but funny. But people did laugh at some of the jokes. People also uncomfortably paused at some of the jokes, and that was what we wanted.”
 
CELEBRITY STATUS
 
The video had accumulated half a million views by the start of Harvard-Yale weekend, with links on Buzzfeed, the Huffington Post, USA Today, and dozens of other websites, and Clark was quite the recognizable celebrity in New Haven during The Game. 
 
“The most entertaining part by far was the reactions of drunk Yalies,” Clark said.  “Most of them were actually not hostile...it was a lot of walking past [people] and mumbling followed by, ‘It’s the video dude! It’s the big tour dude!’ [There were] people behind me at various lines, like at the porta potty, being like, ‘Hey can you give me a fake tour?’ to which I would respond, ‘I charge now’ or something like that.”
 
Clark recalled several instances of fans screaming upon seeing him, including a group of seemingly intoxicated women who took selfies with him on the streets of New Haven.
 
Clark could only point to one instance in which a Yale student actually gave him a difficult time. “I was trying to find out where [Nick Chapel] was in one of the residential colleges...and I went up to some guy and asked him...to which he very very sassily responded, ‘Well shouldn’t you know? Since you give these tours?’ But then the brilliant part about it was, I assume his girlfriend, maybe just a friend, punched him in the chest and said, ‘Be nice!’ and then told me exactly where it was. Which was awesome.”
