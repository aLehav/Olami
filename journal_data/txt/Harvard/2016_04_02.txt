After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The motifs of Helen Oyeyemi’s first short story collection, “What is Not Yours is Not Yours,” are keys. At times, they act as a central element in the plot, defining a character’s unknown origins or hiding the deadly secrets of an artifact. In other moments, they play a minor role, providing the means to a happy resolution or co-conspiring in a prank. Regardless of keys’ prevalence in any one story, however, their recurring presence hints at one of the book’s themes: one of opening doors—literal or metaphorical—into the lives and psyches of other people and into certain social constructs. This idea is one that governs every story in the collection, whether it be for the characters or solely for the reader, and one that defines the impression left on the reader. “What is Not Yours…” is an engrossing, provocative exploration of the human desire to unlock the truth and of the impossibility of ever succeeding.
Oyeyemi’s collection delves primarily into the human experience, but she blends the stories together often with a fantastical twist. In “Is Your Blood as Red as This?”, puppets house the souls of once-living humans and even move, carrying other marionettes and lost keys at one moment. A psychological experiment on mourning creates living specters of people in “Presence.” In “Dornička and the St. Martin’s Day Goose” an old woman makes a promise to a “wolf” and as a reminder of her oath receives a wart-like bruise, which she chops off and keeps locked in a chest—to the danger of her goddaughter’s child, who finds its scent alluring. Despite these outlandish, extraordinary embellishments, “What Is Not Yours…” remains grounded in realistic themes. At its heart, “Presence” explores human grief and the fantasies that people invent to cope, along with the relationship between husband and wife. And “‘Sorry’ Doesn’t Sweeten Her Tea,” despite its obscure ending, delves into serious questions about abuse, victim blaming, and ownership of one’s wrongdoings. Rooted in social truth, these ideas, when combined with the supernatural, allow Oyeyemi to successfully present her collection as an introspection into human behavior and the often unsettling questions that surround it.
Making the collection even more engaging to read, the author exhibits incredible mastery of language, stringing simple words together to create vivid, memorable images. “Montse saw that the Señora sometimes grew short of breath though she’d hardly stirred. A consequence of snatching images out of the air—the air took something back,” Oyeyemi writes as she describes the work of a painter in the opening story “Books and Roses,” which focuses on an orphan who unknowingly wears the key to a secret inheritance. Here, the last phrase rings in its striking poignancy, an effect that Oyeyemi consistently exhibits in her writing through the collection. For instance, as the narrator of “Is Your Blood as Red as This?” describes her first meeting with a crush, she says: “I saw your eyes like flint arrows, and your chin set against the world, and I saw the curve of your lips, which is so beautiful that it’s almost illusory—your eyes freeze a person, but then the flickering flame of your mouth beckons.” Once again, Oyeyemi smoothly impresses a picture of desire on the reader through subdued metaphors. Such linguistic restraint and emotional power drives every individual story.
But language is not the only feature connecting the short stories; a sense that all the stories exist in the same universe also ties the collection together. In the latter half of the book, Oyeyemi achieves this effect by referencing characters from earlier pieces, particularly “‘Sorry’ Doesn’t Sweeten Her Tea” and “Is Your Blood…” Myrna and Radha of “Is Your Blood...” are the tenants of protagonist Jill’s Catford house in “Presence.” Meanwhile, Chedorlaomer, the absent friend of the protagonist in “‘Sorry’ Doesn’t…,” and Tyche of “Is Your Blood…?” make a cameo in “Freddy Barrandov Checks...In?” These moments not only serve to build a cohesive setting but also provide answers to the many unsolved mysteries of earlier tales. The resolution of Myrna and Radha’s turbulent relationship in Presence” gives some hints, even if a hundred pages earlier, “Is Your Blood...” remained ambiguous. The mystery behind the unknown woman, breaking into Ched’s house and answering his calls? “Freddy Barrandov...” offers the likely explanation. While referring to previous narratives might seem to undermine the mystery that Oyeyemi painstakingly sets up moments earlier, this is in fact far from the case. Oyeyemi does provide some answers, but she refuses to offer any clue as to the events that occurred between when the reader last saw the characters and their present iteration. Without this backstory, the author further emphasizes the enigma of her characters’ lives—an enigma that try as the reader may, she will never grasp.
The result is a collection of stories that both reveal and obscure. In that respect, “What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours” is aptly titled: It is a book that affirms the impossibility of an outsider—the reader, in this case—ever comprehending the mysteries of another being’s life and a work that revels in the everlasting locks that exist between people. Fiction often opens doors into the intricate workings of humans, but for Oyeyemi and her latest work, reality often contains more secrets than answers. The reader comes to realize that what is not ours will truly never be ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitcom star Rashida L. Jones ’97, known for her roles in “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” will be the College’s 2016 Class Day speaker.
Jones, an Eliot House alumna and Comparative Studies of Religion concentrator, will address the Class of 2016 in Tercentenary Theatre on May 25. She made her acting debut the year she graduated from Harvard, and has since appeared in dozens of films and television shows, including the Harvard-centric “The Social Network.” These days, she stars as the titular character in “Angie Tribeca,” a police procedural parody.
“I am truly honored to come back to campus and speak at Class Day 2016. Harvard was such a transformative place for me in so many ways,” Jones said in a press release. “It’s where I first had the idea for Facebook, which went on to make me billions of dollars and change the world. Oh wait, that wasn’t me…” 
In addition to acting, Jones also dabbles as a screenwriter, philanthropist, producer, and comic book author. In 2012, she starred in her first screenplay, “Celeste and Jesse Forever,” alongside Andy Samberg, who spoke at Class Day in 2012.
At Harvard, Jones was a member of Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the Harvard-Radcliffe Opportunes a capella group, the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club, and the Black Students Association. She lived in Weld 25 as a freshman.
This year’s cast of commencement-week speakers became famous for their time behind or in front of the camera. Steven Spielberg, famous for many of his films including “Jaws,” “Indiana Jones,” and “Schindler’s List,” will headline the commencement exercises for the entire University.
Class day speakers at the College are often pop culture and comedy icons. Last year, Natalie Portman spoke to Harvard seniors on Class Day.
Jones will be the first relative of a former Class Day speaker to deliver the address, according to a press release. Her father, legendary jazz musician Quincy Jones, was the speaker in 1997. Jones’s “Parks and Recreation” co-star Amy Poehler was the 2011 Class Day speaker.
Irfan Mahmud ’16 and Gabriela D.M. Ruiz-Colon ’16, two class marshals, led a subcommittee that deliberated on the speaker.
“We are thrilled to honor Ms. Rashida Jones. Both as a Harvard College alumna and as a woman of color in Hollywood, Ms. Jones serves as an inspiring role model for the Class of 2016, and we are looking forward to hearing from her,” Mahmud ’16 said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tensions flared in a standoff between activists and opposing students at Harvard Law School Friday as an intensifying debate that began over posters evolved into one about rights to space and free speech on campus.
The controversy began Monday, when third-year Law student William H. Barlow—a vocal critic of the Reclaim Harvard Law student group—put posters on the walls of the Caspersen Student Center lounge equating the activist movement to Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. Activists removed the posters—an action Barlow considered a violation of his right to free speech.
Barlow said he originally intended for the posters to publicize his concerns that Reclaim Harvard Law has had a “chilling effect” on speech at the Law School. Activists have been occupying the lounge, which they call “Belinda Hall,” since February as part of their efforts to create a space they say does not exist for minority students at the school. Barlow has spoken out publicly against the occupation and activists’ demands, which include changing the school’s now-defunct seal and creating a critical race theory program, an idea he has called “racist.”
Barlow claimed Both Trump and Reclaim “support the suppression of dissent, and, to a certain extent, both of them support or endorse racist ideologies.” Barlow put up posters that read “Reclaim Harvard Law = Trump.”
Reclaim Harvard Law member Rena T. Karefa-Johnson said activists decided to remove the posters they considered to be offensive, in part because the Muslim Law Students Association held a conference in the lounge the day Barlow put up signs referencing Trump.
After activists took the posters down, Barlow appealed to administrators and began a week-long postering campaign in protest, affixing to the walls signs that accused Reclaim Harvard Law of censorship. Barlow maintained that the lounge is a public space where any student is allowed to speak freely. Activists, however, claim that while they have repeatedly invited dissenting students to speak with them, occupying the lounge gives them control of the space.
“This is an occupation. This is our space, our house,” Reclaim Harvard Law member Alexander J. Clayborne said. “Let Bill Barlow put up posters anywhere else, just not here.”
The dispute came to a head Friday, when dozens of Law School affiliates filled the student lounge as Barlow and several supporters returned at 2 p.m. to put up another round of signs. Confrontations between activists and dissenting students quickly turned hostile, as students sharply debated both the poster issue and their right to film their opponents in the lounge. Activists did not discard any of Barlow’s signs, but instead moved them to a wall under a sign of their own creation that read “Privilege.” Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells watched the the events unfold and fielded questions from both sides.
Administrators face criticisms from both camps. Barlow met with Sells to voice his concerns earlier in the week, alleging that activists who removed his posters had violated the school’s “Protest and Dissent Guidelines.”  Activists, meanwhile, took issue with administrators’ rhetoric and speed of response.
Sells issued a statement to the Harvard Law Record, writing “The University’s and Law School’s commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom, however, requires that those who use shared space for expressive purposes must respect the rights of others to do the same, including those who disagree with them. These values of free exchange are essential to an academic community.”
Late Friday morning, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow reiterated this message in an email to Law School affiliates, stating explicitly that the lounge was a communal space available to all students, and removing posters is a violation of the school’s Protest and Dissent Guidelines. She wrote that administrators are working to create a designated space for students to post their opinions and provide guidelines to ensure that the space is inclusive. Additionally, the school will “take steps to ensure that students and student organizations have ample opportunities to use space to engage in study, discussion, teach-ins, and other forms of collective speech and action.”
Minow’s reference to a Law School policy prohibiting “[u]sing or threatening force or violence” struck a chord with activists, who interpreted the line as an implication that Reclaim Harvard Law members could turn violent.
“I have been deeply disgusted with the way it has felt like a dog whistle. When have we ever been violent?” Titilayo S. Rasaki, a second-year Law student and member of Reclaim Harvard Law, said.
Barlow, meanwhile, expressed disappointment that administrators have thus far refrained from taking disciplinary action against students who took down his posters earlier in the week and allowed members of Reclaim Harvard Law to relocate his signs on Friday.
The controversy comes at the start of the school’s admitted students weekend, and some prospective students observing the debate unfold in the lounge Friday said that protests at the school will factor into their decision to attend.
Admitted student Paul Maneri said he has been following ongoing activism at the Law School in order to determine how racial tensions could affect his experience there.
“I’ve been trying to figure out if these issues are specific to Harvard—if Harvard is doing things better or worse than other schools–since it seems like [race] has been more of a conversation here,” he said. “I’m wondering if that’s because things are worse here, or if people just care more.”

It seems like spring is finally here in Cambridge, with the flowers blossoming and the air smelling like poop again. As offended as your nostrils are, however, here’s something to brighten your day: it’s April Fools’ Day! Struggling to come up with a legendary prank? Don’t worry. Flyby has some suggestions for you:
For your blockmates/suitemates:Water trap:Here’s a chance to get rid of all those red solo cups you bought at the beginning of the year. Fill them up with water. While your blockmates are sleeping, cover their entire floor/common room with these cups of water so that they are trapped on their beds. Stepping on any of these cups would result in a domino effect and eventual deluge. Good luck.
Lock in:Get some sturdy string or wire. If you live in a suite with multiple doubles/singles, tie the doorknobs of two bedrooms together, so that they can’t open the door from inside. Get them to promise you ten El Jefe’s burritos before letting them out.
New Hair-do:Get some cheap (temporary) hair dye from CVS. Mix it in with your blockmate’s shampoo. Make sure to snapchat their reaction. You might even get on the Ivy snap story for once.
For your roommates:A night under the stars:This one is perfect for those of you with roommates who sleep like the dead. With the help of your suitemates, carry your roommate's bed, upon which your roommate should still be fast asleep, outside. Drop them off in the middle of the yard or Quad lawn (I got you, Quadlings). Your roommate will probably wake up to the amused murmurs and camera flashes of confused tourists. A sure way to not only make it onto the Ivy snap story, but also most likely the front page of the Crimson!
Redefining “on fleek”:Another trick for those of you with roommates who are very heavy sleepers. While your roommate is sound asleep, shave off one eyebrow. Can be done easily with a little bit of shaving cream and eyebrow razor, conveniently sold at a CVS near you. Be prepared with a back-up rooming group though... this one may leave you alienated just days before the Housing Lottery.
The Missing Turkey:Find the avian celebrity, the Harvard Turkey. Find the turkey a friend (she/he/it must get lonely roaming around the streets of Harvard all alone). Label the original turkey with a #1 tag. Label the second turkey with a #3 tag. Yes, you read that correctly. Not #2, but #3. Where is the #2 turkey you ask? The world may never know.
For Pre-Frosh:Yale sucks 1.0:Conveniently, regular decisions for most colleges are being released right about now. This is a challenge for you genius coders out there: figure out how to get on the Class of 2020 listserv, and send them an email assigning them a 20 page research paper on how much Yale sucks. Then start a chain of Reply-Alls saying "please take me off this list."
Yale sucks 2.0:If the challenge above is too easy for you, here’s the hacker version: hack Yale’s admission page to display a huge sign that says: “It’s not too late, Class of 2020! Transfer to our better half: Harvard!” Which would link to Harvard’s admission page. (Though, of course, Flyby doesn’t endorse illegal hacking.) We’d be pranking the Yalies even before they get to New Haven. Who knows? Maybe the lucky few that got accepted to both schools will choose Harvard over Yale. (But let’s be real. Who wouldn’t?)
For the Lampoon, the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine?:Looks like Conan's got this one covered ;).
