This January, Netflix released its original series “Cunk on Earth” in the U.S. Produced in association with the BBC, the show is another biscuit to add to the tea party of British humor. In other words, it is markedly dry and should be only consumed when you’re feeling rather posh. The mockumentary features the fictional Philomena Cunk, who takes the viewer on a journey across time from prehistoric cavemen to the world today. In her own words; “This is the incredible story of how humankind transformed our world from being loads of pointless nature … to full of modern things”. The series, however, is not Cunk’s documentary debut. Charlie Brooker, one of the men behind “Black Mirror,” created her in 2013, and comedian Diane Morgan has embodied her ever since.
Throughout the show, Cunk interviews various experts and academics regarding the theme of the episode. She astutely mimics the dress, mannerisms, and phrases of documentary narrators. Most remarkable of her imitations is her look of contemplation: a tilt of the head, a purse in her lips, and a mild furrow of the brow. Even her title, “Landmark Documentary Presenter,” fulfills the ostentatious yet ill-suited terminology surrounding nonfiction film. In this way, she comically deflates the pretentious and laudatory attitude that many historical documentaries assume.
Philomena, however, is unlike other narrators in that the character has no clue about what is going on. For instance, in episode three she asks if the “Renai-sauce” was “a sort of 16th century ketchup.” When Professor Martin Kemp of University of Oxford admits that he is “not necessarily a sauce person,” Cunk looks off camera and dejectedly says, “we’re going to have to rethink this whole interview.”
Cunk’s bluntness also extends to her historical commentary. The irony between human claims and human actions, such as America’s hailing of freedom while cruelly enslaving people, are numerous. Cunk describes these ironies as if she were the first to discover them, mimicking the egoism that many serious documentaries hold. As many of our readers will already be aware, Cunk dryly comments that World War I was in fact not “the war to end all wars.” In cases like this, the Netflix mockumentary can sometimes drag over trodden, unoriginal paths.
However, that is the nature of most documentaries themselves. Written by Westerners for Westerners, much of nonfiction entertainment fails to address the other half of the globe. Cunk, while following this trend, is also aware of her limitations. While praising the Gutenberg press, she notes how it is the first of its kind when you ignore China’s independent invention of the printing press centuries earlier.
The true delight in “Cunk on Earth,” though, is not the absurdity or the irony, but the relationship between Cunk and those she interviews. Because she is often mistaken in her historical interpretations, she surprises intelligent, educated people by forcing them to confront the ignorance of the real world. Rather than glorifying the past (and the garden-variety historian’s knowledge of it), she centers on the real, mundane, and often uneducated present. As a result, Cunk challenges experts and academics to engage in historical conversations that are accessible rather than heavy with turgid terminology.
Frequently Cunk turns the historical discussions towards her friend Paul, a running joke in the series. As these whimsical and disturbing tales of Paul make the interviewed academics speechless, the viewer is left to enjoy the awkward silence that follows. In episode 3, she tells Dr. Sara Taglialagamba of the Da Vinci Museum, “My mate Paul invented a treadmill for his fiance’s pet snake, and the sketches for that were much more convincing” than those of Da Vinci’s. Unfortunately for Paul, the treadmill did decapitate the snake. “Worst ending to a birthday party I’ve ever been to,” Cunk said.
Most of the historical experts respond to the tales of Paul with nods and looks of uneasy consternation. Paul, however, is not the greatest obstacle they face — it’s Cunk herself. Upon discussing the inventions of the Wright brothers, Cunk tells Professor Jim Al-Khalili her own theory behind the science of flight: “It’s just because we believe planes can fly that they do. So the media has to keep up the pretense or they’re just going to start dropping out of the sky. Same with Wi-Fi. There’s no way that’s real.”
Another time, Cunk informs Dr. Myrto Hatzimachili of the University of Cambridge that her favorite of Aristotle’s sayings is “You’ve got to dance like no one’s watching.” As Hatzimachili reveals that Cunk has misattributed the origins of the quote, we watch Cunk as she falls into internal disarray. She says, “My confidence is quite brittle at times, and I know I come across as quite confident, but sometimes when I’m talking to experts, I worry that, you know, I might come across as a bit stupid.”
“Cunk on Earth” is worth watching because not only because it evokes schadenfreude as the academics struggle to cope with Cunk, but also because it ridicules the bubble that encapsulates academic life. Most of the historians react amicably to Cunk’s surprising personality, but some also appear horribly confused.
The mockumentary has a number of other quirks sprinkled throughout, like repeating the same 44 seconds of a certain late ‘80s techno-dance song, making the show all the more enjoyably absurd. If you are feeling bored and British, the show is a quick 30-minute infusion of nonsense.

After only his third season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, football star Tom Brady decided to officially retire in early 2023. Brady is possibly the most controversial modern-day figure in the football world, and his retirement has certainly attracted a lot of attention — both negative and positive.
Brady’s retirement comes after a solid 23 year long run during which he spent the first 20 years of his career playing with the New England Patriots and the last three with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He definitely has an impressive record, retiring with seven Super Bowl wins under his belt — both the most wins of any NFL player in the league’s history and more wins than any single team. Brady’s regular season record compared to other teams in the league is also impressive: He individually won more games than all of them except for the 2023 Super Bowl champions, the Kansas City Chiefs.
It is impossible to overlook the fact that this final retirement announcement follows Brady’s divorce from his wife of thirteen years, Gisele Bündchen. In fact, this is not the first time Brady announced that he would be allegedly “retiring.” On Feb. 1, 2022, Brady officially announced that he would be retiring to focus more on his family life. However, just six weeks later, Brady backpedaled on his decision and reentered the world of professional football, claiming he had “unfinished business.” Considering that this transition back to the NFL meant that Brady would be shifting his focus back towards his career rather than his family, Brady’s return could not have been good for his relationship with Bündchen OR his marriage.
Brady's return to the NFL for the 2022-23 season following his initial retirement marked him as the oldest active player in the league. Despite his age, he still performed relatively well; however, Brady openly admitted that the struggles he experienced with his marriage at this time were directly affecting his performance on the field. Shortly after his return to the league, the couple officially announced that they would be splitting, causing much of the internet to speculate that Brady officially chose football over his family. This could only make the fact that he lost his playoff game — now the last game of his career — against the Dallas Cowboys, with a score of 31-14, all the more bitter.
This retirement has also already led to several absurd trends, including the purchase of Brady’s retirement sand — as in the sand from the beach where the NFL star announced his retirement. Brady’s retirement sand was bottled up and listed for $100,000 on eBay, reflecting the public’s obsession with Brady and his concluding NFL career. Although uncertain if this retirement will truly be his last, it is safe to say that many eyes will be on the next steps that Brady takes in both his public and personal life.

Maggie Rogers has contagious energy.
During the second of three shows at the Roadrunner kicking off her tour in support of her new album “Surrender” on Feb. 10, the Maryland native singer-songwriter squatted down low, bouncing on her heels, beckoning the audience to follow her lead. “Don't be too cool,” she said.
Rogers sang the last song written for 2018’s “Heard It in a Past Life,” “Light On,” building up to a crescendo as she slowly rose with the volume. Soon everyone was jumping. Following her lead, the audience stayed dancing for the rest of the song.
Rogers' show was an emotional rollercoaster for her and her audience. It was feral joy, rage, humility, despair, and infinite awe of Rogers and her incredible ability to be constantly captivating.
It's hard to describe Rogers' style, or fit her into any one genre. Her songs are peppy like pop, but her performance style seems more spontaneous. Her rhythms border on R&B, but when she picks up the acoustic guitar, there's a country twinge in her voice. Some of her songs are love ballads, in some of them she preaches, and in others, her band rocks out as she sways side to side.
Beginning with fan favorite “Alaska” — a song about self healing after a toxic breakup — performed a cappella, Rogers was later joined in by light percussion and echoing keyboard sounds that resembled water dripping. “cut my hair so I can rock back and forth without thinking of you,” she sang. She moved her head side to side, rotating her hips back and forth to the beat. Her guitarist, sporting a Harvard baseball cap, danced with her in the center during a dance break.
In “Want Want,” Rogers danced with wild abandon, letting the forward-hitting beat carry her around the stage as she powerfully sang into the mic. But the energy didn’t cease when she traded her wild movements for an acoustic guitar.
During the lighthearted love song “Love You For A Long Time,” videos of clouds floated behind Rogers as she strummed the guitar. “I feel it in my body / know it in my mind / I'm gonna love you for a long time,” she sang.
The most stirring part of Rogers' set was a song she sang with the opener, Samuel Holden Jaffe, professionally known as Del Water Gap. Rogers and Jaffe were in a band together during their time at New York University when they wrote “New Song,” an indie folk song about young heartbreak that they now play on tours together.
On stage, they switched off verses, Rogers on the banjo, Jaffe on guitar. The blending of Rogers' voice with the banjo was astonishing. Despite the overlap, their voices were distinct — while he bounced back and forth, she rocked side to side. “I don't mind it,” they sang together.The song ended softly, with a strum of the banjo and Maggie's sorrowful voice on the last note.
Several times in between songs, she looked out at the audience with pure joy on her face and brought her hand up to her heart. Rogers gave the impression that there was nowhere else she would rather be. Her optimism, emotion, and confidence was infectious. She spun around the stage, sauntered back and forth in her sparkly dress and matching gogo boots.
“I cannot imagine a more perfect place in the world to start this tour,” she said.
Even so, the joy didn’t stop Rogers from completely diving into the emotions of each song she performed. During “Shatter,” an angry, high energy ballad, Rogers marched across the stage, singing high and loud, performing intuitively and moving fluidly. The performance was so emotional that she paused afterwards to calm down.
“I’m going to play the next song in 30 seconds, I’m just so fucking mad from playing the last song,” she said.

If you told people last year that the thirty-year delayed “Top Gun” sequel would be one of the best movies of 2022, they would have laughed in your face. A sequel to a movie about overly masculine, oiled up fighter pilots speaking in action movie cliches? Really? But now, much to the dismay of Letterboxd patrons and film bros around the world, “Top Gun: Maverick” has not only been nominated for Best Picture, but is one of the frontrunners to win the Academy’s most prestigious award. As with every box office hit that gets nominated for the prestigious prize, this praise comes with a bit of controversy. However, as fun as it would be to dunk on another legacy sequel cash-grab, “Top Gun: Maverick” is one of the best movies of the year, and the praise that it’s getting from the Academy is well deserved.
The Academy, to put it bluntly, has been struggling. Viewership continues to plummet year after year, social media has a stranglehold on viewer attention, and American infatuation with celebrity culture just isn’t what it once was. From the audience’s perspective, this makes sense: Why should the average American tune in to watch people they have nothing in common with praise movies they’ve never heard of? Realizing this, the suits at the Academy needed to nominate a universally beloved movie with a recognizable star that the average American would want to get behind, and “Top Gun: Maverick” fits the bill perfectly.
Hollywood politics aside, “Top Gun: Maverick” is a fantastic movie. Yes, the propaganda is still apparent and the hints of American imperialism still bleed through, but when a movie is reliant on military funding and approval, some form of a recruitment ad is to be expected. The true merit of “Top Gun: Maverick” is that, in spite of these constraints, the movie provides an experience that can be universally enjoyed. The sound design is impeccable, the actors are remarkably committed, and the action set pieces may be the best in recent history. Even the cheesy lines and straightforward story come off as endearing under the guise of the film’s 80’s action movie aesthetic. But most importantly, the film creates a spectacle that so effectively incites a mix of awe and adrenaline long forgotten by theatergoers. No matter who you are, it’s hard to deny the rush when you hear the roar of an afterburner.
This may be the greatest case for “Top Gun: Maverick” this awards season. The modern blockbuster landscape is dominated by CGI slog-fests, churned out by visual effects artists under the heels of profit-driven studios. The result is a subpar theater experience that moviegoers have no choice but to accept, and that studios justify with delayed streaming releases. “Top Gun: Maverick” is a direct response to this, with a cast and crew so hellbent on realism that they would rather become pseudo stunt pilots than resort to a minute of greenscreen. Because of this intense commitment to authentic effects and stunts, “Top Gun: Maverick” has effectively revived moviegoing culture, and its superb box office performance will hopefully eliminate studio complacency in visual effects.
So does “Top Gun: Maverick” deserve to actually win Best Picture? Probably not. But nevertheless, Kosinski and Cruise have put together one of the best action movies of our generation and have hopefully corrected the course of mainstream cinema. And for that, they can have as much Academy praise and baby oil as their hearts desire.

Donning a sparkly black blazer and a messy hairstyle, mehro took the stage with just his guitar while the crowd broke into cheers. The LA-based singer-songwriter and producer, opened for Claire Rosinkranz alongside DWLLRS on Feb. 8 at Boston’s Paradise Rock Club. The line outside of the venue extended far beyond the front of the club, and by the time mehro came on stage there was a full house.
Despite opening for Rosinkranz, mehro greeted a sizable audience of his own fans. The alt-indie artist performed “pirate song,” the third track on his upcoming album “Dark Corners and Alchemy,” set to release on Mar. 23. With a sea shanty-esque swing, strong bass, and lyrics like “are you ready / to let me in,” “pirate song” was the perfect opener.
Mehro’s fan interactions undeniably heightened the intimate vibe throughout the duration of the concert. At one point he paused to tell the story behind his song “hideous.” With fans reacting to every line, he described a complicated romantic situation that led to heartbreak. His candid storytelling paired with the audience’s interaction made the moment feel like a conversation with a friend.
“The most important part of my life I’d say are the meaningful relationships with people where the time that you put in is well worth the emotion that you feel, the love that you feel, the connection that you feel with that person,” the artist told his fans.
Mehro expressed the deep, sharp pain that came from a prospective partner rejecting his emotions with his performance of “hideous.” His longing, soulful vocals combined with reflective lyrics effectively capture the feeling of insecurity he felt during his heartbreak.
He opened his next song, “whore,” with the lyrics; “We’ve all been used before / Nobody’s clean / I’ll love you anyway.” With a gentler, more mellow feel, mehro showcased elements of lo-fi-bedroom pop with the lyrically and melodically repetitive chorus. Despite his sparkly attire, mehro kept much of his performance understated and intimate while simultaneously sustaining an excited energy. He closed the night out with “chance with you,” leaving fans with one last taste of his sensuous, falsetto vocals and poetic lyrics. The song, which is about the regret of failing to approach a love interest, ended the concert full circle, returning to the theme of unrequited love and admiration present throughout mehro’s discography.
Mehro’s warm and energetic performance definitely left a strong impression on new fans. It’s safe to say the “innocently intimidating” artist is one to watch.

With an ensemble cast and directing from Aline Brosh McKenna, “Your Place or Mine,” released on Netflix on Feb.10, should be a knockout film. With McKenna’s previous films including “The Devil Wears Prada” and “27 Dresses,” expectations were predictably high for Mckenna’s most recent film. Disappointingly, however, the movie instead falls into a number of overdone storytelling cliches and fails to give adequate time or space for watchers to form genuine connection with the movie.
In the film, Peter Coleman (Ashton Kutcher) and Debbie Dunn (Reese Witherspoon) are two lifelong friends who, through unexpected circumstances, end up on opposite sides of the country. They fight to remain friends despite their distance, but live very different lives: Debbie is a helicopter mother to her son Jack (Wesley Kimmel) in their cozy Los Angeles home while Peter lives aloof and alone in his New York apartment. Through unexpected turns of events, Peter ends up volunteering to watch Jack, despite him being a teenager, while Debbie finishes a degree in New York.
A cast boasting the likes of Kutcher and Witherspoon should mean fun and shenanigans, but due to at-times tacky writing, normally comedic scenes become uncomfortable to watch. The first act of the film, in many ways, feels reminiscent of an attempt at the popular life-swap storyline. “The Holiday” from 2006 or “The Parent Trap” from 1961 exemplify these well-known and loved films in which phenomenal cadres of actors are thrown together and their individual talent shines as they effortlessly build off of each other. In contrast, “Your Place or Mine” feels as if the writing and subtleties of the story take center stage and put Kutcher and Witherspoon out of their element.
Ashton Kutcher is no stranger when it comes to comedy with his starring roles on “That 70’s Show” and “Valentine’s Day,” and has also shown audiences he can seriously perform after the release of “Jobs.” However, his role in “Your Place or Mine” doesn’t allow for either facet of the actor’s personality to shine through, as he is stuck playing an internally conflicted, overly-confident guy. Unfortunately, the same can be said for Witherspoon, which is surprising after the critical success of “Big Little Lies” and “The Morning Show.” Although the story itself may not be original, the presentation was unnecessarily rigid and restricted the actors’ potentials.
One of the most potent examples of how the film doesn’t give the characters time to develop comes at the end of the film’s first act.
While Peter is trying to help Jack reconnect with some of his middle school friends by buying them box tickets to watch the L.A. Kings play. His attempts to buy Jack’s friendship are met with apathy. Jack’s kid friends don’t care. In many ways this scene is, ironically, suffering from the same problem as the entire film. By splurging for big-name talents and shorting on the rest of the components of the film, “Your Place or Mine” does the same thing. It avoids the heavy lifting required of quality movie writing, and instead kneecaps the possibility to let the aforementioned stars shine. This issue is particularly noticeable for Peter who comes across as one-dimensional. In the film, Kutcher plays the same funny yet serious recent bachelor as in “Valentine’s Day,” but without the cornerstone of a great, original story, the character falls short regardless of the actor’s talent.
“Your Place or Mine” has all the potential to be a wonderfully fun film, but ultimately isn’t as enjoyable because it tackles too much. Whether it’s working too hard on the writing and thus putting actors in a corner or over-building characters with too much distracting information that isn’t necessary to the story, the film feels scattered. At its core, “Your Place or Mine” is enjoyable to watch once, but it doesn’t deserve a re-watching, which is a shame for such a notable group of actors and writers.

Jack and Rose fade out on screen, “Titanic” credits begin to roll, a mellow melody playing in the background.
“My Heart Will Go On” is one of the most iconic songs of the ’90s, but the road to the track’s creation 25 years ago was no walk in the park. After Irish Singer-Songwriter Enya declined the project, American composer James Horner was tasked with composing, orchestrating, and conducting the soundtrack to the now-iconic movie, “Titanic.” Horner had originally composed the basis of what is now “My Heart Will Go On” as an instrumental motif throughout the soundtrack, heard in tracks like “The Portrait,” for example, (“Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls”). He then suggested developing the motif into a full song, to be released with the film’s soundtrack.
To this, “Titanic” director James Cameron originally responded with disfavor. Cameron did not want the end credits of his epic historical drama to run to the tune of a pop song, ­reportedly commenting: “Would you put a song at the end of ‘Schindler’s List’?”
Still, Horner went ahead and composed the pop song anyway.
Horner brought in Wilbur H. "Will" Jennings to assist as the lyricist for the project. While Jennings would typically write based on a script or rough cut of the film, this was not the case for “Titanic.” Instead, Horner explained the script’s story to Jennings and shared the theme that he had composed.
From there, Jennings was inspired, saying he “wrote everything from the point of view of a person of a great age looking back so many years … It was the love story that made the film.”
Last came the vocals. Horner already had Céline Dion in mind, but convincing her to join the project wasn't easy. She had just enjoyed the massive successes of “Because You Loved Me” as well as the title track of Disney film “Beauty and the Beast” and was not eager to jump into this new endeavor.
At one point, Dion, Horner, and Dion’s (now late) husband and manager René Angélil were together at a suite in Caesars Palace. Horner wanted to show Dion what of “My Heart Will Go” he had so far, and so began to play and sing it on the in-suite piano.
In an interview with Billboard, Dion commented on the life changing moment; “With all the respect that I have for James — poor him, this guy is looking above us right now — he is not the greatest singer. I was making this sign like, ‘This is not possible.’” Her husband stopped Horner, saying “James, James, James. Listen to me. You’re not doing justice to the song right now. I’m going to make a deal with you: Let’s have Céline make a demo.”
Though she went ahead with the demo, Dion did not hesitate to vocalize her discontent: “I wanted to choke my husband. Because I didn’t want to do it!”
Despite her reluctance, Dion went into the studio one evening to try it out. The singer proceeded to electrify the atmosphere with her rendition of the song. By the time she was finished, everyone present was crying, and Horner informed her that they may not even need her to sing it again. Indeed, this first take is the one that found itself in the film.
The production of “Titanic” had not forecasted success — the movie had been far over budget and filming was delayed for months. Nobody expected the swell of popular and critical acclaim yet to come.
The movie, of course, quickly captured the hearts of millions. “Titanic” opened a few days before Christmas on about 2,700 screens in the US, and grossed $28 million in its first week. It went on to gross a worldwide total of over $2.2 billion on a production budget of $200 million, and became the highest-grossing film of all time in 1998 (a title it held for the next twelve years). It also received 14 Oscar nominations and 11 wins including Best Picture.
The film’s soundtrack and song “My Heart Will Go On” experienced similar success. The record topped the charts in more than 25 countries, was the world's best-selling single in 1998, and would become one of the best-selling singles of all time. In fact, the picture and record experienced a symbiotic relationship of sorts, in which the popularity of each boosted that of the other.
Céline Dion also recorded and released a slightly different version of “My Heart Will Go On” for radio. While the one-take film version has a more melancholy, melodic feel with an extended ending, the track produced for the radio has a fuller sound, supplemented with percussion, strings, and electric guitar. It is this iteration of the track that won the 1998 Grammys for Record of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Song Of The Year, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. Still, the general integrity of both tracks remains the same, and they fundamentally share the qualities that make “My Heart Will Go On” the cultural titan that it is.​​
What exactly makes “My Heart Will Go On” so special? It is most helpful, perhaps, to start at the beginning.
“My Heart Will Go On” is enrapturing from its very first notes. Its sound is initially quite hollow, as the signature Irish tin whistle pierces the air with a simple yet iconic melody. The overall effect is gorgeous yet undeniably haunting — it conveys a sense of grief and loss, but also of memory, meaning, and timeless love.
The lyrics only add to this sentiment. Jennings’s lyrical storytelling is versatile:
It reflects the film’s narrative of Jack’s death and Rose’s memory of him, but there is also a sense of universality within it. This quality allows “My Heart Will Go On” to be appreciated not just in the context of being in the “Titanic” soundtrack, but as a standalone piece about the transcendent and transformative power of love.
Even more impactful is the song’s structure, culminating a powerful slowburn into a rousing finale. As previously mentioned, the song begins quite unassumingly. Dion is reserved vocally: She begins with a gentle almost-whisper. Even as she enters the subsequent verses and chorus, and the instrumental becomes a bit more full, her voice grows only marginally. This choice, paradoxically, only adds to the track’s effectiveness. It is well-known that Dion is a vocal powerhouse, so her use of a softer vocal sound creates an airy yet extremely emotive quality to the record.
This unassuming start sets up what is one of the most iconic and impactful key changes of all time. After a rousing second chorus, Dion’s vocals dramatically cut out, paving the way for a brief instrumental bridge which builds into a stunning modulation on the final chorus. Dion’s soaring yet effortlessly controlled vocals exclaim, “You’re here, there’s nothing I fear … We’ll stay forever this way.” Meticulously crafted from beginning to end, the track meanders to its conclusion, fading out slowly into a single hummed line.
It seems that most critiques of “My Heart Will Go On” revolve around the song’s constant cultural circulation over the years. The song has been played and replayed to no end over the years. At the same time, there is no doubt that the record is an iconic cultural entity. There is a reason, after all, why — 25 years after its release — everybody is still intimately familiar with “My Heart Will Go On.”
The songwriting, production, and of course Céline Dion’s signature tone join to create a beautiful and emotional piece. Factoring in its relation to the heart-wrenching story in “Titanic,” what results is more akin to a spiritual journey than mere song. Although created against the odds and despite a series of roadblocks, it seems that the legacy of “My Heart Will Go On” will endure — as a society we just seem unable to let go.

With a foundation rooted in his Kentucky and Appalachian heritage, Cameron Snowden ’25 creates music that brings stories to life through rich bluegrass sounds. Snowden released his debut single, “The Daylight,” on Feb. 3; The country song spells out a story from an experience Snowden had this past summer. Though his official music debut might have been recent, his history with music is anything but.
Snowden first became interested in music when he was in elementary school; he credits his father with having the most influence over his taste.
“When I was really young, my dad would play all the music that he liked for me, which was a big assortment of different things. It was Nirvana, some Gorillaz, all kinds of things,” Snowden said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Snowden began writing songs when he was in middle school. In fifth grade, he began going to flea markets and collecting vinyls of bands like the Beatles. Snowden’s Kentucky upbringing had a strong influence on his songwriting process. Growing up, he was exposed to acoustic guitars and string bands.
“Growing up around a bunch of country and bluegrass has definitely influenced how my music sounds now,” Snowden said.
These influences make themselves known in “The Daylight,” with the lyrics being accompanied by an acoustic guitar. The vocal twang present throughout the song is incredibly reminiscent of classic country sounds. Inspired by a “riveting night” with his friends in Kentucky, “The Daylight” showcases Snowden's passion for storytelling. While the experience happened this summer, Snowder wrote the song this past fall, while pacing the halls of Pforzheimer House with the melody in his head.
Though country and bluegrass are the primary genres that Snowden gravitates towards today, he has written songs in other genres. When he was in middle and early high school he mostly wrote hip-hop and R&B songs. Snowden believes that there is an interesting connection between country and R&B that has yet to be fully explored, citing Chris Stapleton’s “Tennessee Whiskey” as an example. Eventually, he took a break from songwriting in high school, when the pressure to make popular music made writing less enjoyable. When he finally decided to return to songwriting, Snowden wanted to focus more on the music he enjoyed. Listening to a variety of artists, most notably Tyler Childers, Snowden embraced the country style when making his own music. He is very proud of his Kentucky and Appalachian heritage, so seeing the success of an artist like Childers (a fellow Eastern Kentuckian) resonated deeply with him.
Snowden was not always proud to be from Eastern Kentucky. Pop culture led him to look down on his rural upbringing. However, Childers' success inspired a reformed attitude towards his home state and Snowden resolved to bring Kentucky and Appalachian influences into his music.
While he prefers that the true meaning of “The Daylight” be left up to interpretation, Snowden hopes that his pride in his Appalachian heritage shines through. The word choice, imagery, and descriptions work to represent his upbringing from the very first bars of the song: “I traveled up the road on a star-studded evening / and I wandered through the trees while the crickets laughed aloud.” The contextualization paints a multisensory image of what it might be like to experience rural Kentucky in the summer.
Snowden credits “The Daylight” as being produced by Kargon Records, a joke that gives life to his aspirations. Kragon is the name of the unincorporated community that Snowden is from, and this record label does not actually exist — though Snowden was quick to add on “yet.” While Kragon Records might not exist, “The Daylight” was in fact produced in Kentucky. He recorded it in Fat Caves studios with the help of his good friend Sam Rogers.
Music is not Snowden’s only hobby. He is also fond of playing chess and is the co-founder of the Harvard College Appalachian Student Association, which helps advocate for all Appalachian students who tend to be underrepresented on campus. Snowden’s pursuit in creating this club is emblematic of his celebration of his Appalachian heritage.
While some of Snowden’s future plans include more advocacy for Appalachian people, he also has several musical projects he wishes to pursue. His current plan is to release two more singles and possibly an album or an EP. Though his music will still be primarily in the country/bluegrass genres, potentially venturing into R&B, his upcoming works will not necessarily be connected to the sonics featured on “The Daylight.”
Snowden is only just beginning to publicly promote his music, but as his music career progresses, he would prefer to be thought of as “some kid from Kentucky.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I visited Lahore for the first time in a year this winter break.
I was greeted by the familiar embrace of my parents at the airport. As we stepped out of the terminal, bags in hand, I caught a glimpse of another acquaintance of mine who studied in the U.S. making his way towards a car. We were probably on the same flight.
Each winter break, as several Pakistani students make their way back to the country for a few weeks, it is often the case that one runs into peers traveling at the same time as oneself. Our homecoming begins somewhere between Istanbul, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, where we often share layovers and flight delays — thanks to Lahore’s treacherous smog — together.
Yet, these fragments of familiarity that characterize many of our return journeys soon begin to dissipate. Every time I come back to Lahore, it feels different. It doesn’t matter how frequently I call home, or how up-to-date I am with my friends’ lives despite the 10-hour time difference. There’s a stark difference between glitchy WhatsApp calls detailing my grandmother’s illness or the more than three dozen texts that detail my friend’s inability to cope with an impending breakup, versus experiencing these events as they happen: confronting them face-to-face, without the usual hint of retrospective clarity and consolation that often dominates many of my calls home.
When you layover in a city for just three weeks, you often feel like a stranger on premises that you used to call your own. This is the home that you long to go back to, only to find out that you remembered a version of it that no longer exists.
Thus, when I saw how my mother appeared more visibly exhausted than when I had seen her last winter, neglecting her own health to tend to my ailing grandmother, I could do nothing but listen to her reassurances about her well-being. I couldn’t be there for her longer than three weeks – at best, I could urge her to schedule an appointment with the doctor while I was still in Lahore.
My father’s 12-hour work days became a similar source of concern. Here I was, witnessing him confine himself to his ‘home office,’ with only meals serving as real breaks from his new job. I wanted him to spend those hours writing – what he loved doing best – but his work had rendered him incapable of finding the time to do so.
As I begin to end my time at Harvard, and increasingly ponder about how I can support my family once I graduate, I am confronted with a series of intimidating questions every time I apply for internships, research grants, and get on a networking call. How much do I want to earn? How much is enough? Where will I be located?
Where will I be located? I don’t know.
Because on the one hand, I’ve always wanted to work in Pakistan – everything I care about, and have tailored my education towards, is based there. Yet employment in the United States would likely be more lucrative than most opportunities back in Lahore. This was the only advice I got during my three weeks at home, too: People that had initially encouraged me to return upon completing my degree now grimly described the recent economic devastation, urging me to stay put in the US.
There is a looming sense of escape: “Everyone wants to leave, and is leaving here. You have the option to stay in the U.S. Don’t waste it.”
I didn’t know how to explain to them, as they meandered between conversations over cigarettes and cups of tea, that I didn’t want to further my sense of foreignness at home.
My friends, also fellow returnees from wherever they were in the world, felt similarly about navigating the perceived constancy of home, and the newness that they now had to confront. Collectively, we are a handful of students that have been given a wild-card, in the form of prestigious scholarships or financial aid awards, to make a life for ourselves beyond Pakistan. Yet as we grow closer to actually being able to do so, the costs of being away from family and the familiarity of home suddenly become apparent, pervading one’s every decision.
At Harvard, we are constantly prompted to make the most of our time here: chase every opportunity, travel, meet as many people as possible, engage with a neverending list of communities. As we endeavor to exhaust the possibilities that our four years in college present, we recraft our definitions of home and find our chosen families. Yet we often lose sight of the implicit tradeoffs we make with the worlds we leave behind.
As I packed my bags at the end of my third week in Lahore, this time to embark on a journey to the U.K. for a study abroad program, I only wished that I had more time at home. I didn’t care if the conversations were inconclusive, frustrating, or left me with more questions than answers.
I just wished that time at home stopped feeling like limbo — empty time extended between semesters, and between my supposed pursuits to craft a life abroad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the California high school I attended, “Global Studies” was a course that every student had to take during their freshman year. The textbook of choice was, perhaps unsurprisingly for a public school, a bit dated, with that early 2000s beige look and feel that many readers might not find too difficult to picture.
Given the age of the material, its concluding chapter — which textbooks usually reserve to touch on future developments within their discipline of focus — predictably discussed the one word that was on many a pundit’s mind around the turn of the millennium: globalization. Indeed, the narrative that humanity was moving along a yellow brick road toward transcending national borders not only defined my early childhood, and potentially those of my peers, but was also found by one cross-cultural study to be a positive sentiment widely shared by members of Generation Z.
In the face of such internationalist momentum, especially among youth, it may seem ironic that the past ten years have arguably seen some of the most intense pushback toward the idea of worldwide integration. Whether one points to the proliferation of populist politicians casting doubt on the legitimacy of multilateralism, tit-for-tat escalations of tariffs and other barriers on free trade, or Covid-19 and the general havoc on global integration it has wrought, it is clear that globalization has shed some of its infant luster.
And yes, global integration has never been all peaches and cream, and legitimate concerns about the manner in which it has transpired abound. Multinational conglomerates have too often amassed inordinate influence in many countries, sometimes to the point of being capable of threatening or even engaging in regime change. Worries that unfettered trade can destroy both local economic and environmental ecosystems are also perfectly valid and deserve appropriate attention. These are all intellectually honest reasons to be skeptical of how globalization has taken shape.
However, one particular contention made in opposition to global integration has seen an explosion in popularity over the past decade — one that stems more from economic hypernationalism and chauvinism than reason. It is what I refer to as the “romantic” trope: the notion that there existed a time when things were decisively not globalized, and everything was much, much better. We have seen examples of such rhetoric play out in the United States, where many have mythologized historical periods like the 1950s to the point of absurdity.
This sort of nostalgia for some glorified past is certainly not a thematically novel one. After all, it has long been an endearing motif for artists, one that is incidentally represented in the collections of the Harvard Art Museums. For instance, the astute patron can find on its second floor Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres’ famous “The Golden Age,” painted in 1862 at the height of a Neoclassicist revival in Europe that focused on contrasting the purity of antiquity with the degeneracy of the present.
Even so, there are far more works at the museum that exemplify how, throughout history, global integration has almost always been the norm rather than the exception. Take, for example, the multitude of eighth-century Buddha figurines on its first floor that reveal an eclectic mix of Greek, South Asian, and Chinese influences; or entertain the museum’s comprehensive collection, also on the first floor, of over forty examples of eighteenth-century “Meissen porcelain,” the first commercially successful porcelain produced in Europe after centuries of attempting to imitate the originally Chinese craft.
The origin stories of Greek Buddhas and Meissen china, along with countless other historical anecdotes, help demonstrate how humanity has been guided by a global perspective since the dawn of civilization. They highlight the fact that intercultural exchange lies at the heart of what it means to be human — and that even when the transfer of goods and ideas is slowed down by mandate or conflict, like gas particles in the face of an impossibly fine mesh, their diffusion simply morphs into effusion, their speed of movement never reaching absolute zero.
Global integration can be culled, and free trade can be suppressed, but if history is any guide, the world will never stop being global.
And for the better. As studies have generally shown, nothing beats greater global connectivity in enhancing aggregate prosperity, as long as the right national and supranational frameworks are in place to limit exploitation and excess. Though the annals of the 2010s will now bear the indelible marks of extreme nationalism, let us dedicate this decade to promoting a renewed global vision for the future, one that is not only ambitious in nature but inclusive and equitable in scope as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this year’s Super Bowl, two Black quarterbacks, Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts, led their teams to face off for a championship. Before them, only six Black quarterbacks had ever started a championship game in NFL history.
Although this achievement may seem trivial, Mahomes and Hurts are doing a lot more for the Black community than just playing sports. Quarterback is one of the most well-respected and glorified positions in football, which is shown by the fact that their salaries are often two or three times higher than their teammates. Watching so many inspiring athletes on TV, I realized that sports can be a unique and efficient medium for Black activists to utilize.
Why? Firstly, Black people stand out on the field in ways they often cannot in other spaces. There are examples of Black success in politics, music, art, and education, but in the sports arena, the public cannot turn away and ignore what we have to say. Black people create the revenue. Black people have the power. Activism always comes with risk, but athletic power often makes it so we can have a voice without facing quite as severe consequences.
Black athleticism begins with people like Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who raised their fists during the national anthem after winning Olympic medals in 1968. They did this in protest of racism around the country, shortly after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. At this moment, Smith and Carlos earned everyone’s attention, and their protest is still widely remembered today.
There are more contemporary examples as well. LeBron James, a Black athlete, is arguably the best basketball player of all time. LeBron was allowed to kneel during his games, and wear Black Lives Matter t-shirts freely, perhaps because the NBA knew they would suffer without him.
Football player Colin Kaepernick also kneeled in protest of the national anthem, but paid the price for it, eventually losing his job; he is still working to be on a team again. Despite this personal cost, Kaepernick made a significant impact — we will never forget his name, and his actions reverberated far beyond his own fate.
Secondly, athletes’ relatability and accessibility give them the power to fuel activism in Black youth who watch sports. Many Black boys today want to be football and basketball players at least in part because those leagues give them the representation they need. They believe that they can be great because they see people who look like them doing great things.
Because of their platform, athletes have the chance to be role models for children watching, not just sports idols. LeBron James grew up in a single-parent household and in poverty, and faced a lot of difficulties in his youth. Because of this, he learned how to save and didn’t indulge in many materialistic things, educating Black kids and his younger peers about budgeting and money management.
James also built a school in Akron, Ohio, to support at-risk kids, funded by his personal foundation. In addition, he has managed to largely avoid scandals, proving to be a great role model to those who admire him. Through his character, his actions, and his activism, LeBron does a lot more for young Black kids beyond just playing basketball.
The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, are also great examples of Black role models in the world of professional sports. Richard Williams, their father, became famous for the way he raised his daughters to be stars, with discipline and determination. Serena and Venus Williams display unwavering confidence, even while playing professional tennis at a very young age. I have noticed the rise of young Black women in tennis, like Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka, because the Williams sisters inspired them to believe that they could make it too.
Black athletes can make change on the collegiate level as well. Deion Sanders, the former football coach at Jackson State University, has recently been encouraging leading black athletes to go to Historically Black Colleges and Universities — schools that have been  underfunded due to a long history of oppression.  He intends to restore the HBCU-to-NFL pipeline, starting by encouraging the top-ranked football prospect last year to sign with Jackson State, an HBCU, rather than at a school in one of the NCAA’s flagship conferences. This increased Jackson State’s revenue, and many other HBCUs and coaches followed suit in strengthening athletic programs for advancement of these colleges.
Activism is inefficient without strategy, and we must apply pressure where we have power. Although it sometimes has adverse consequences, like Colin Kaepernick losing his job after kneeling during the anthem, activism through athletics has proven to be a widely successful endeavor. LeBron James, Serena and Venus Williams, Simone Biles, Colin Kaepernick, Tommie Smith, John Carlos, and many others have had a huge impact on Black activism by dominating their sports, and Black athletes should continue to use that power to advance the cause of Black liberation.
When we become dominant, we cannot be silenced, we cannot be ignored, and we cannot be erased. Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts leading this Super Bowl is a win beyond football, and we must continue to make strides for Black people through this medium.

Harvard’s Ohiri Field, which sits across the Charles River in Lower Allston, has all the markings of an ordinary university facility. On any given day, soccer players stretch on the grass beneath the sun, Business School affiliates chat lively en route to classes, and a dynamic mix of tourists and residents stroll along, shadowed by the Harvard Stadium.
For nearly two years, I walked by it without a glance — until one mid-September morning when a friend made a passing comment as we walked along the street that flanked the field. “Did you know napalm was first tested here?” he asked, gesturing toward the expanse of green. Little did he know, he set my world spinning.
Napalm is one of history’s deadliest weapons, its story intertwining with that of military America. Reaching temperatures of more than 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (by comparison, water boils at 212 degrees), it adheres to skin and burns down to the bone.
During World War II, United States forces used napalm to incinerate 64 Japanese cities, killing more Japanese people than the atomic bombs. Napalm also devastated Germany; its deadly heat baked soldiers hiding in bunkers, and the Allies dropped an estimated 3.4 kilotons of napalm bombs on Dresden, killing up to 135,000 civilians.
From Korea to Iraq, napalm has served most major military conflicts since the 1940s. But its controversial legacy was made in Vietnam, where its use plunged the country into a fiery hell and galvanized the U.S. anti-war movement.
But for me, napalm extends far beyond the bold lines of history textbooks. It holds a personal place at home.
Coming from a line of Vietnam War refugees — my parents, fifteen aunts and uncles, and four grandparents — harrowing anecdotes of violence, corruption, and hardship pervaded my childhood. Bedtime stories and dinnertime tales taught me that more than three decades ago, my grandfather was imprisoned in a re-education camp, my mother was constantly hungry, and my father was unable to tell whether the loud noises he heard coming from the street were popcorn vendors or bombs.
My family did their best to live, until they couldn’t and realized that the ocean was safer than the war-torn land. So they planned, saved, and bribed. They dressed in the darkest black to camouflage with the night and slipped to the shores, where small fishing boats packed hundreds over capacity were docked. Somehow, they survived the week-long journey, with nothing but stars and prayer to guide them through the pirate-infested waters. Up to 400,000 boat people didn’t.
I’ve long understood that weapons of mass destruction like napalm have shaped the trajectory of my heritage — that their destruction played into my family’s choice to toss their fates into the sea. What I didn’t know was the first chapter of the violent legacy I’ve inherited began at my institution: Harvard.
I almost couldn’t believe it. I associate napalm with the unspeakable, unthinkable horrors of war, like the 1968 Mỹ Lai massacre where U.S. troops mass murdered hundreds of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians. I associate napalm with cover-ups, unchecked power, immeasurable suffering, and eyes that flash with a murderous evil. I most certainly didn’t see napalm at Harvard, idyllic as it stands today.
This place, after all, prides itself on upholding truth. Our motto “Veritas” is sculpted into the roofline of Widener Library, emblazoned in Memorial Hall’s stained glass, and worked into the wrought iron gates at every corner of campus. The sculptures we walk by — the buildings we live in — all call on us to seek what’s true. So why was it that almost no one I talked to knew the truth of napalm?
Attempting to finally place napalm and the conditions of its invention in the spotlight, I set out on a journey to understand — or rather, demand — the truth.


Robert M. Neer Jr. ’86, author of “Napalm: An American Biography,” is one of the first people I reached out to. His book, which traces napalm’s journey from its inaugural test on Ohiri Field to the United Nations’ 1980 ban of its deployment against civilians and beyond, stands as one of the first extensive narrations of the weapon’s history.
“When I started working on this project, the only publicly available information about napalm I could find was two paragraphs on Wikipedia,” Neer tells me. “I kept thinking that at least there would be some kind of a historical journal article or something. But there really wasn’t.”
He attributes the lack of prior written information and American public awareness on napalm to a sort of selective memory — one that erases “unpleasant” history from cultural consciousness.
“It’s not something that people want to focus on,” he says. “It’s an uncomfortable story.”
Through months of research, outreach, and investigation, I’ve attempted to write my own history of napalm at Harvard. I contacted Phan Thị Kim Phúc, the subject of the world-renowned 1972 photograph depicting the immediate aftermath of a napalm attack on the village of Trảng Bàng, and spoke with dozens of weapons experts, historians, and Harvard affiliates. I combed through archival information to uncover the story of the key scientist behind its creation, Louis F. Fieser.
When I reached out to Harvard’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology for an interview about Fieser’s work, they declined.
As napalm’s checkered history is unearthed, questions emerge about who bears responsibility for the millions of deaths it's caused: the scientists who created it, hoping their efforts would help end WWII? Harvard for supporting the research and partnering with the military? Or are the weapon’s inventors exempt, with the blame placed solely on those who authorized its use?
If Harvard and Fieser’s team are indeed accountable, what — if anything — should the University do now to acknowledge the role they played? Amid Harvard’s other efforts to reckon with its past, lessons arise from napalm’s ashes.
Tucked away in the Harvard University Archives are the files of Fieser’s life: decades of birthday cards and holiday letters addressed to him and his wife Mary; drawings of their two Siamese cats, Syn K. Pooh and J. G. Pooh — named after Fieser’s chemical inventions (“I wanted to name him Napalm, but the name was a military secret then,” Fieser said in 1952); passports, scrapbooks, yearbooks, and his marriage license.
I came to the archives seeking the story behind the man who invented napalm. Was he particularly war-obsessed? Or was he just a talented chemist? Could napalm have been brought into the world by anyone?
I would soon learn that to the people who knew him, Fieser was first and foremost a teacher adored by his students, a husband who worked alongside his wife, and a scientist who pushed the boundaries of organic chemistry.
At Harvard, where he taught for nearly four decades, Fieser was regarded as a dedicated and gifted professor. Famous for his inventive teaching methods, a slew of sources detail a yearly laboratory technique competition that pitted Fieser against his students, his creation of a sixty-minute film to supplement his lectures, and outlandish classroom demonstrations.
One lesson, titled “How NOT to Perform a Recrystallization,” ended with Fieser’s bald head and six-foot frame coated in activated charcoal, to the delight of students in Chemistry 20, Harvard’s introductory class to organic chemistry.
In a 1949 inspection of his research and literary activities, Harvard Chemistry professor George B. Kistiakowsky wrote that Fieser was the “oldest man in the Department” and “does more work than anyone else in the Department.” I sifted through endless newspaper clippings of awards he won and dozens of notes congratulating Fieser on a laboratory named in his honor.
An orange “Louie” sweatshirt branded with Fieser’s face even began circulating throughout Harvard Square, and he proudly showed up to class wearing one. But although Fieser was something of a public figure, he led a secret life — as an explosives researcher for the U.S. military under the National Defense Research Committee.
The NDRC, which conducted top-secret warfare research, set into motion work on some of the nation’s most important WWII technologies, including radar and the atomic bomb.
At a 1941 conference on explosives in Chicago, NDRC chairman and sitting Harvard president James B. Conant ’13 told attendees that several explosions had occurred at a DuPont plant manufacturing divinylacetylene — marketed as a synthetic drying oil for paints. The substance might have military application, Conant said, and they needed someone to investigate.
“I volunteered,” Fieser wrote in a first-hand 242-page account of “unusual” war projects he worked on.
Harvard assigned Fieser two laboratories in Converse Chemical Laboratory, and he began prompt work with his associate E.B. Hershberg on June 15, 1941, coded at Harvard as “Anonymous Research No. 4.” They were also supported by four younger chemists Fieser called the “War Boys.”
Though the laboratories were in the basement, two concrete wells in the ground, fenced in by iron semicircles, brought in light — and were useful for experiments.
Fieser and Hershberg began their work by testing how divinylacetylene reacts to exposure to air. They placed pans of samples in the window wells and lit them with matches, discovering that “when a viscous gel burns it does not become fluid but retains its viscous, sticky consistency.”
“The experience suggested the idea of a bomb that would scatter large burning blobs of sticky gel,” he wrote.


Research carried into the third floor of the now-demolished Wolcott Gibbs Laboratory, where they continued tests in a “glass-enclosed room-within-a-room” that allowed them to burn incendiary materials and bombs without the risk of wind. They cut a hole into the roof and installed a powerful fan that sucked smoke out of the room, so they could run experiments back to back.
All the while, the duo maintained an air of utmost secrecy, taking great care to conceal their work from friends, colleagues, and pedestrians. They performed their first burns in the outside window well of the corner room, “since this was shielded from observation from the street,” and only corresponded with select military and government officials.
At the end of a day working in the lab, Fieser “would come home with lots of smudges on his clothes from doing various kinds of burning tests,” Neer says.
Fieser wrote that his appearance often “presented a puzzle to my wife Mary.” Though she would co-author 36 research papers with him and collaborate on six books, he withheld his napalm research from her. Eventually, he wrote, “she was let into the secret a few weeks later when she met Major Rambaut at the airport and he asked: ‘How is your husband’s incendiary project progressing?’”
The six-man group remained intact for four years, during which Fieser gave up his teaching and ordinary research but continued to receive his regular salary from Harvard.
“My services were contributed by Harvard, off the record, to the war effort,” he wrote.
The NDRC contract on just the incendiary project totalled $359,125.
On Feb. 14, 1942, Fieser and his team reported to NDRC development that a powder made with “aluminum naphthenate” and “aluminum palmitate” could be stirred with gasoline at room temperature to produce strong, tough, and flammable gels. Fieser named the substance “napalm.”
The researchers arrived mid-morning at what is now Ohiri Field on a directive from the Chemical Warfare Service to test their findings. It was July 4 — America’s first Independence Day since it joined World War II.
Everything was prepared by the time they got there. University workers had dug a circular hole into the field 60 yards in diameter, and two fire trucks from the City of Cambridge filled it with water. As firemen and groundskeepers looked on from the sidelines and players hit volleys in the adjacent tennis courts, Fieser and a train of eight assistants towed a 70-pound napalm bomb to the center of the pool, bolting it on top of a metal stand.
Fieser flipped a switch, and “a spectacular, billowing, 2,100-degree-Fahrenheit cloud arose over the field,” Neer writes in his book.
Napalm was born.
At 9:30 a.m. on Oct. 25, 1967, Harvard and Radcliffe students began a sit-in at the James Bryant Conant Laboratory to block the visit of job recruiter Frederick Leavitt from Dow Chemical Company — the principal supplier of napalm for the U.S. military.
They had been notified of the demonstration from leaflets that asked, “Is it in the interests of chemistry students — or of any students — that war profiteers like Dow prostitute science for repression and murder?” Students for a Democratic Society co-chair Jared Israel ’65 had called for massive student opposition to the recruiter’s upcoming visit, citing “university complicity with the war.”
Dow was complicit in war crimes and genocide, they argued. It had no right to be here at Harvard.
When Ronald E. Vanelli ’41, the director of the chemical laboratories, demanded they disperse, the students refused. But they didn’t know that Leavitt had already relocated to the nearby Mallinckrodt Hall, leaving a decoy businessman behind in his place. No interviewees would show up to Conant Laboratory that day.
At 11 a.m., the group discovered the fact after sending scouts to find Leavitt. They ran, stomps of feet permeating the Cambridge air. Within seconds, Mallinckrodt was filled with the impassioned shouts of angry, dogged demonstrators. They would trap Leavitt — who was in the midst of an interview when they arrived — in Room M-102, for the next seven hours.
At one point, Vanelli attempted to free Leavitt. “They stepped on and over three tiers of seated demonstrators but were then met by rows of students standing, with arms linked,” according to a 1967 Crimson article.
The students interrogated Leavitt about Dow, napalm, and Vietnam for five minutes. SDS organizer Michael S. Ansara ’68 told Leavitt he couldn’t leave until he signed “a yellow sheet of paper bearing the hand-scrawled pledge: ‘I agree to stop interviewing on the Harvard campus and not to return for that purpose.’”
Ultimately, Leavitt did not sign the paper, and retreated back to the conference room.
Throughout the day, nearly all of Harvard’s administrators convened at M-102. Meanwhile, the crowd grew to more than 300 students, despite rumors that the University was going to use police force to remove them.
Blocks away in Harvard Square, volunteers distributed leaflets that featured an image of a child with horrific burns, reading: “CAN YOU SUPPORT NAPALM used against CHILDREN?”
At 6 p.m., students finally voted to release Leavitt after Harvard College Dean Frederick L. Glimp ’50 promised them that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences would further discuss whether Harvard should discriminate between who could recruit its students. The demonstration made national headlines and sent shockwaves through the Harvard community, with four professors writing statements of support for the students and others calling for their arrest.
“The substance is intended to burn out jungle overgrowth, but it falls all too often on Vietnamese civilians,” The Crimson opined the next day, asserting the protesters’ actions were justified. “Napalm — and the company that makes it — have become symbolic of a war that tries to destroy communism by bombing people.”
But not all supported the protest. In a dissent, 14 Crimson editors wrote that the demonstration was “the wrong way to peace” and “reflects a shift in the protest movement away from rational dissent, and into the realm of resistance and violence.”
Although Leavitt’s ordeal was recorded as the longest of any Dow recruiter during the fight against napalm, Harvard wasn’t alone in protesting the company.
Dow reported that during the 1967-1968 academic year, 46 of their 178 visits to colleges across the country and 133 of their 339 interview events were interrupted. The reputational damage cost Dow billions of dollars, and they stopped manufacturing napalm for the military in 1969.


The Mallinckrodt protest against Dow was just one in a torrent of Harvard protests against the whole of the Vietnam War. The day prior, more than 500 people gathered in Harvard Yard for its largest rally in years to oppose U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia. The volatility of campus activity surrounding the war carried for years, and in 1969, hundreds of students occupied University Hall as some 400 police officers stormed the building.
Some students felt that there was an “underrepresentation of pro-war sentiment on campus,” the Crimson reported, and so Students for a Just Peace organized a “counter teach-in” lecture given by five pro-war speakers on March 26, 1971.
Daniel Pipes ’71, who helped plan the SJP lecture in support of U.S. Vietnam War involvement, says that a “revolutionary fervor” ignited on college campuses nationwide.
That fervor was reflected at Sanders Theatre when anti-war protestors under SDS came to disrupt the lecture. As opposing groups clashed in a chaotic uproar, chants of “U.S. out of Southeast Asia; butchers out of Harvard!” filled the space.
James P. Stodder ’71, an SDS organizer, was one of the students opposing the lecture. In an interview, Stodder says he was motivated by “just some innate feeling of sympathy for people in pain and for people being oppressed for no good reason.”
After the protest, Stodder and nine other students were brought before the Committee on Rights and Responsibilities, a Harvard-created court, on charges of disruption. Harvard later retracted Stodder’s financial aid, forcing him — without a way to pay — to withdraw after his junior year.


“Looking back, there isn’t much I would have done differently,” Stodder told The Crimson last year.
Ira G. Helfand ’72, another SDS organizer, was arrested in 1972 while participating in protests against Harvard. Helfand calls Harvard’s disciplinary actions toward student protesteors “outrageous.”
“I thought that this was an institution that was supposed to be safeguarding the values which we all share of freedom, democracy, justice,” Helfand says. “It was instead supporting some very vicious governments around the world.”
Helfand adds that Harvard “was deeply involved in planning and executing” the Vietnam War. “There was a real shock associated with that, and a sense of betrayal,” he says.
Nicholas B. Lemann ’76, who was president of The Crimson, says that “a very significant opinion among undergraduates” was that Harvard shouldn’t do any work under contract with the Department of Defense at all.
In “a never-ending procession of moral challenges,” Lemann says, the institution’s ties to the development of the atomic bomb and the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps came under fire, leading to the ROTC program’s ban from campus in 1971. Harvard has since lifted the ban, opening an ROTC branch in 2012.
“There’s always a conversation as far as I can tell, at Harvard, about Harvard’s moral place in the world,” Lemann says. “Harvard is not a very ivory tower-esque institution. It’s deeply, deeply implicated in pretty much everything that’s happening in the world.”
Eventually, Fieser’s heroic reputation also got caught up in the waves of anti-war sentiment. Up until public opinion started to turn against the Vietnam War, Fieser was widely congratulated for his work on napalm. In 1948, President Harry Truman awarded Fieser a certificate of merit for “outstanding fidelity and meritorious conduct in aid of the war effort.” Soldiers sent him letters claiming that his invention had saved their lives.
But by the latter half of 1967, Fieser’s reputation was as contentious as the protests boiling across the United States.
Fieser “received letters raising questions about his involvement with napalm and about its use in Vietnam,” The New York Times reported in December 1967. “He said some of the writers were saying, in effect, ‘We thought you were a great guy, and now you’re a bum.”
“I suffered with the ugly scars and the pain for the rest of my life,” Phan Thị tells me, recounting the napalm attack that desecrated her village 51 years ago. Her voice shakes as she speaks. “Why me?”
Phan Thị was nine years old when she and her family hid at a Cao Đài temple in Trảng Bàng, Vietnam after the war broke out. They had remained there with villagers and soldiers for three days when roars of planes came within earshot. One soldier advised them to run away, telling them that the temple was going to be bombed, so they rushed outside.
Phan Thị recalls watching a plane fill the sky above her and its deafening scream. Then, she heard four bombs hit the ground. She didn’t know it at the time, but those bombs were filled with napalm.
“Suddenly I saw the fire everywhere around me,” she recounted in a Boston Globe interview. “At that moment, I didn’t see anyone, just the fire. I saw my left arm burning. I used my right hand to try to take it off.”
But napalm sticks to its victims as they burn. It seared off Phan Thị’s clothes, got into her eyes, and disfigured more than a third of her body. It scorched away her pores, leaving her unable to sweat.
As Phan Thị ran down a dirt road, chunks of flesh melting off of her, she screamed, “Nóng quá, nóng quá!” (“Too hot, too hot!”). Phan Thị ran until she passed out. Feet away, Associated Press photographer Huỳnh Công “Nick” Út, clicked his Leica camera to capture the scene that would shock the world.


The photograph of Phan Thị with her hands outstretched, face contorted in agony as a thick cloud of smoke rises from her bombed village behind her, appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Titled “The Terror of War,” Út’s photo won a Pulitzer Prize and became one of the most prominent and haunting photos of the 20th century.
Wide circulation of the photo played a significant role in bolstering the anti-war movement and turning public opinion against the use of napalm, which had previously been considered an effective and useful tool in carrying out war efforts. Some also credit the photo with hastening the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam.
Phan Thị says that napalm forever changed her life. The tragic attack killed two of her cousins, covered her in permanent scars, and hospitalized her for 14 months. To date, she has undergone 17 surgeries to treat her injuries.
“You don’t grow out of the scars, physically or mentally,” Phan Thị wrote in a New York Times guest essay last year. “Napalm sticks to you, no matter how fast you run.”
Phan Thị confides that she was victimized not once, but twice; first by the napalm that gave her third-degree burns and again by the attention brought on by the photo’s popularity.
When Phan Thị was 19 and pursuing a career in medicine, the Vietnamese government identified her as the child from the iconic photo. They pulled her out of school to exploit her fame, arranged interviews with foreign journalists, and made her give talks against the evils of capitalism. Subject to severe government surveillance, Phan Thị lost all of her friends and spiraled into a deep state of bitterness and depression.
“I lost my freedom. I lost my dreams. I lost my future,” Phan Thị says. “I hated everyone around me. I hated all those people who caused my suffering.”
She stood one day next to a speeding train of traffic in Saigon, contemplating whether she should “jump into the cars and die.” It would take years before she found peace, prayer, and eventually, complete forgiveness — of the pilot who bombed her village to Fieser and his team.


Today, Phan Thị is 59. She lives in Canada, has two children, and founded an organization, the Kim Phan Thị Foundation International, to provide psychological and medical aid to child victims of war. As a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, she gives dozens of lectures each year.
“Every one of us in this world can learn how to live with love, with hope and forgiveness,” Phan Thị says. “That little girl in the picture of napalm? She can do that.”
But for Phan Thị, forgiveness is not “agreeing with the evil thing.”
“Not at all,” she says. “They destroyed people.”
Between 1963 and 1973, U.S. forces dropped 388,000 tons of napalm on Vietnam. South Vietnamese forces also took advantage of napalm’s power and conducted bombing campaigns — including the attack on Phan Thị’s village.
“Napalm wounds were as common in Vietnam as bayonet wounds had been in the First World War,” biographer Denise Chong wrote in The Guardian. Doctors didn’t anticipate treating its victims as their probability of death was higher than needing medical aid, according to Chong.
While napalm’s use in Vietnam took place more than 50 years ago, survivors like Phan Thị are still experiencing the pain caused by the weapon. Its image and impact live on.
Three weeks after Fieser tested the first napalm bomb on the Harvard College soccer field, Harvard Business School Dean Donald K. David received a letter of complaint.
“Irritating vesicant fumes clung to that corner of the field for several days,” wrote U.S. Navy Captain K.C. McIntosh, explaining that the area was also a drill field for the Navy Supply Corps School. “Effects of these fumes were still visible in the eyes of one officer six days after exposure. In addition, some seventeen officers required treatment during the night.”
Fieser wrote to McIntosh, asserting that his invention wasn’t responsible for the injuries: “I find it difficult to believe that there could have been a direct connection with the disabling of some of your personnel.”
Though telltale signs of napalm’s potential to cause lethal harm arose over the course of Fieser’s research efforts, which were classified as an official project of the U.S. Department of War, Fieser maintained that he didn’t anticipate its deployment on people beyond its initial use to clear buildings and structures.
"I couldn’t foresee that this stuff was going to be used against babies and Buddhists,” he told Associated Press reporter John Lannan in a 1967 interview.


“I think that’s total bullshit,” says Zach B. Nowak, a Harvard history lecturer who’s writing a book on the College’s 385-year-legacy. “That Fieser invents a jellied form of gasoline and can’t imagine how it could be used I find very difficult to believe.”
“The idea that after World War I there isn’t going to be massive collateral damage to civilians, for any sort of war thereafter — give me a break,” Nowak says.
As I inspected page after page of Fieser’s extensive notes detailing the wartime work he conducted in his Harvard lab, I rarely came across mention of ethical doubt. In an account on poison gas experiments he did for the NDRC, Fieser wrote that although its use “seemed to me inhumane,” he “swallowed my personal feelings and engaged a new group of men to start research.”
For napalm, though, Fieser felt fewer qualms: “It was better than working on poison gas,” he said.
It’s unclear whether Fieser genuinely failed to predict napalm’s future application against civilians or simply chose to ignore the possibility. The dangerous and oftentimes volatile nature of his work inclined me, like Nowak, to suspect the latter.
One WWII project, Project X-Ray, stood out to me as especially morally dubious: a post-Pearl Harbor plan to transform millions of bats into napalm-armed suicide bombers. Fieser designed the device at the heart of the project — a tiny 17.5 gram napalm bomb with a time-delay mechanism to be strapped to each individual bat.
The bats, which were refrigerated to force hibernation, would be “flown over Japanese cities at night and parachuted down into warm-air,” Fieser wrote. At specific altitudes, they “would awaken and carry the bombs onto or into highly combustible Japanese houses.”
Japan’s major cities, whose buildings were commonly built with paper and wood rather than concrete, would be reduced to ashes in a matter of minutes.
In Utah’s Great Salt Lake Desert, the crew ran bat bomb tests in a mock village of German and Japanese houses, furnished to the finest details. From chopsticks on the tables in the Japanese houses and children’s toys scattered on the floors to replica tatami mats and bedrooms with authentic clothing in the closets, the study required more than 750 pieces of furniture and 700 cloth components.
But despite $30 million of investment in today’s dollars, years of work, and the sacrifice of millions of bats, the project was terminated — likely because the atomic bomb was chosen as a quicker means to end the war.
As I examined images of the model village, a knot formed in my stomach. The plan obviously targeted people’s homes, not factories — test images even included Japanese people sleeping in them. It seems impossible to me that Fieser could have worked on this project without considering that its impact may extend to people. How could any line be drawn between building and person — between roof, furniture, and skin?
Nevertheless, Fieser distanced himself from the impacts his invention had on the world. Although he later condemned the U.S. military’s use of napalm against civilians, Fieser expressed no remorse for having contributed to its creation.
“The person who makes a rifle… he isn’t responsible if it is used to shoot the President,” he told the Sunday Herald during his retirement in 1967. “I feel no guilt, and I would do it again if I were called upon.”
Fieser asserted his accountability ended when napalm exited the laboratory.
“I don’t know enough about the situation in Vietnam. It’s not my business to deal with the political or moral questions,” he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1967. “Just because I played a role in the technological development of napalm doesn’t mean I’m any more qualified to comment on the moral aspects of it.”
“I suspect that they thought they were developing something that would help to defeat the Nazis who were viewed as sort of the supreme evil. They probably didn’t imagine that 30 years later, napalm would be used to kill innocent children in Vietnam,” Helfand says.


After graduating from Harvard, Helfand worked on issues surrounding technology and ethics, helping found two organizations that won the Nobel Peace Prize. Helfand’s work, which focuses on nuclear disarmament, considers how the world should grapple with the ethical problems raised by weapons like napalm.
“Society needs to figure out how to create rules and governing bodies that regulate these technologies in ways that do not cause harm,” Helfand says. “We have consistently shown a cleverness in our technology that is not matched by wisdom in our decision-making.”
While Helfand sees napalm as inherently problematic and insists that some weapons “serve no useful purpose and should be destroyed,” Phan Thị believes that the true harm lies within the people who deploy the technology.
“The gun itself is okay. If you use it for good, it’s good,” Phan Thị says. “The one who uses that to kill people, to destroy people, to cause people’s suffering — that is bad, is wrong.”
Regardless of Fieser’s intent, he helped create a world with napalm in it. How much can be blamed?
After that September day when I learned that napalm set Ohiri Field ablaze, I’ve found myself returning countless times, not exactly knowing why. I’d make excuses to walk through it, walk by it, walk around it: Let’s pay a visit to my friend at the Business School. I need groceries from the Trader Joe’s across the river. Today seems like a great day to roller skate at the park. Sometimes, I’d just stand there, wanting to do something with the knowledge that it was in this spot the weapon that ignited the world took its first breath.
A month later, I stared again at the grassy field — this time through the foggy window of the 66 Bus to Nubian. From the corner of my eye, I saw something I’d never seen before: an aluminum sign nailed carefully to a utility pole seven feet off the ground, too high up to catch the attention of most people who walk by it.
In bright red text “Napalm Test #1, July 4, 1942” was printed, and a bold arrow pointed beyond the chain-link fence, to the field.
This is the first, and only, physical marker on campus that shows the detonation of napalm bombs at Harvard.


I spoke with the two local artists who put up the marker — Yolanda He Yang and Ross M. Miller ’77 — and asked them about their efforts to make napalm’s story known. Maria Salim, another Boston-area artist, conceived and designed the sign with Miller.
Miller, a Cambridge resident whose art studio is located in Allston, says that he has passed by Ohiri Field for years. He didn’t think much of it until — as he was driving along North Harvard St. — a discussion of napalm on the radio mentioned the field, and he “stopped in my tracks.”
Miller was shocked by the proximity of the napalm tests to Harvard, which he calls the “living room” of Allston and Cambridge.
“This feels like my home. This happened on my home landscape. Oh my gosh,” he says. “This is the middle of the living room. It’s in the middle of the house.”
Both Yang and Miller say they are bewildered at the University’s and city’s lack of recognition and how little physical evidence there was on the field.


“Nobody would recognize what happened here,” Yang says.
“It was a very physical first action in the story of napalm, and there’s nothing telling the story,” Miller adds.
Neer also agrees that larger acknowledgment of napalm’s history is sparse.
“The most striking thing to me about all of the work that I did on napalm in general was actually what I call the silence,” Neer says.
“You can go to Widener Library and look for nuclear weapons and find shelves and shelves of books,” Neer says, rattling off a list of munitions, but “there’s really no information about napalm.”
So, Yang and Miller put the sign up. “Our intent is to present (evocative) evidence, in the most direct way,” Miller wrote in an email.
Salim and Miller modeled the sign after a typical warning or no parking sign. “The intent is for the sign to blend in, almost invisibly normal, until the shock of closer observation,” Miller wrote. A QR code sticker on the back of the sign, designed by Salim, links to more information about napalm’s origins.


Yang and Miller also also put up a second sign by the Business School, which was taken down soon after being installed. They do not know who took it down.
The pair have collaborated on other projects related to napalm as well, including a “non-destructive sculptural installation,” a public demonstration planned for July 4, 2022 — the first napalm test’s 80th anniversary.


In the months leading up to the public demonstration, Yang and Miller attempted to recreate the original napalm tests on a smaller scale to allow the public to experience and understand what happened at Ohiri Field 80 years ago. The event would offer people “an opportunity to connect themselves with history,” Yang says.
“We’re still focusing on this idea of observing, of witnessing, of offering a condition where somebody can experience something physically,” Miller says.
They, along with three other artists, used Yang’s backyard to experiment with a flamethrower and materials that included steel rods, bamboo, paper, and fireproof fabric. They set fire to bamboo structures that resembled German and Japanese architecture — copying the Project X-Ray tests — and planned to transform the entire field into a place “that could talk.”
The demonstration never happened due to a host of bureaucratic and logistical obstacles, but plans for July 4, 2023 are underway.
Yang and Miller hope their napalm projects help deepen connections between Harvard and the Boston community.
Yang regularly takes the 66 and is able to check on their remaining sign: “Every time I see it — ‘Oh good, it’s still there.’”
“Holy shit,” Nowak says when I show him the photographs of the first napalm blast. “It doesn’t make me feel good. It’s horrible to see those pictures.”
“On the shield of Harvard it says ‘Veritas,’” he says. “It doesn’t say ‘warmaking.’”
Helfand echoes the disillusionment.
“We had been told the U.S. were the good guys and that places like Harvard were the good guys,” Helfand says. “And here, we found them behaving in ways that were completely reprehensible.”
“The fact that napalm is made at Harvard is not some radical disjuncture. It fits in with the larger picture,” Nowak says, pointing to centuries of collaboration between Harvard and the U.S. military.
But the story of napalm’s birth at Harvard, he adds, illuminates larger patterns within Harvard’s history, from war profiteering to the military-industrial complex.
“So is it worth telling? Yeah. 100 percent. 100 percent,” Nowak says.


After seeing the field where napalm first exploded, I wanted to visit the labs where the chemical was synthesized. I thought that by being in the place where napalm existed for the first time, its history would feel more concrete.
So, with Neer, I went looking.
We explored the renovated halls of Converse, navigating a maze of pipes in the basement in search of the exact two rooms where Fieser worked on explosives research. Surely there’d be some evidence of Fieser’s work here. Perhaps a room named after him? Or maybe a plaque commemorating his inventions?
There was nothing.
Correction: March 1, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Yolanda He Yang and Ross M. Miller ’77 conceptualized the “Napalm Test #1” marker. In fact, Maria Salim and Miller designed and conceptualized the sign. 
Clarification: March 1, 2023
A previous version of this article stated that Phan Thị Kim Phúc recalled a U.S.-made plane bombing her village. To clarify, this attack was carried out by South Vietnamese forces.

This Valentine’s Day, we asked our writers and editors to write about something or someone they love — the lighthearted, the heartbreaking, the bittersweet, and everything in between. Here are their stories.
***
Hermanita // Little Sister
I forgive you for being so damn bratty. I hear it’s really hard to be six these days. You have a quick mind and a sharp tongue, a little diva, waging sassy war against a cruel, cruel world — God, we really are related. 2,000 miles are now wedged between us. I watch as we age over Facetime. Blink and I swear you’ve shot up another inch. I miss you something awful. I’m sorry I can’t sing you happy birthday. Flights are expensive, and chasing dreams incurs its own costs. I hope you’ll chase yours one day too, but with a fraction of the tears and much more laughter. Could you just stay this tiny forever? If you’re serious about this stinky business called “growing up” (DANGER! TURN BACK NOW!), just let me know. When the tears inevitably fall like rain, I’ll be here to dry them off. Always.

Memorial Drive always makes me think of you. I remember our last sunset there like it was yesterday. The sky glowed orange and pink and I know it sounds strange but sometimes I swear I can still feel it.
That’s something they don’t tell you about grief: the way you’ll start believing in magic. The way you’ll trust that after three months, they’ll still show up at your doorstep like they never left. The way you’ll convince yourself that they’d pick up the phone if you dared to call. The way you’ll imagine that every penny on the ground is a sign, even though you’ve never looked for signs, because it is, it is, it is.
It makes sense to me, that love could defeat the laws of nature. So when the sky lights up on Memorial Drive, and the colors you loved illuminate the house where you used to live, I don’t question it. I believe that you’re right there with me, that you’re watching it all unfold, that you feel the brightness, too. I believe in you, like I always do.

NYC; Home
The apple on my tongue is sweet and bodied as I move down the city on the 1 train — my body still, invigorated with sweat. Today, my intake is psychiatric therapy; tomorrow, it’s ink — a new tattoo. Each contains distinct measures of pain and joy.
My chest ceases its movement. The only thing I know is the girl in front of me: my soul, my sister. She is lying inside of her mother’s sauna blanket and I wish I could seize her overwhelm, tuck it in my pocket, fold her body into mine. I bring her dinner and clean her room and when she hugs me goodbye, it’s fierce like all of my past selves combined.

For my 21st, I spent weeks organizing a birthday party, only to have my friends leave halfway through for a Halloween party (the woes of having a late October birthday). I felt a kind of bone-deep loneliness when I picked up my own cake and walked home, the bag slamming against my legs hard enough to smudge the frosting until my name was illegible. I entered my hallway single, sinking to my knees in tears. For my 22nd, I walked into a room full of sweets, photos, and friends and felt genuinely surprised. I’ve spent a lot of college inundated with homesickness, but that moment was the happiest I’d been. I think about it often because it’s when I believed friends could be family.

My childhood was a revolving door of friends. I’d move. They’d move. We’d grow apart. We’d go to college. So when she fell out of my life, I wasn’t surprised. That doesn’t mean I didn’t cry under the flowers of my blue duvet, that I don’t scroll her Instagram to see how long it’s been since she posted a photo with me, and that I don’t see a video sometimes and think, “She would die laughing at this.” It must have been an accident, a force of habit, but as I scrolled on Pinterest one day, I pinned something to one of our shared boards. It was a wedding board, where we’d planned everything from bridesmaids dresses to table cloths. A little gray banner with a green icon descended upon my screen to compliment the dress I’d picked out. From opposite sides of our screens, we admired it together.

There’s so much piss on the seat. I can’t really be mad — that’s the beauty of all-gender restrooms. I give it a wipe before I perch. Other than that, it’s surprisingly clean for a club bathroom. The bathroom of a club. White-tiled oasis from the dirty stinky sticky sweaty jungle of the dance floor. Whatever your longing might be: a space to cry, a private spot to dip a finger into the baggie in your friend's bra, somewhere a stranger might attempt to help you get the wine out of your satin leopard print shirt that, of course, you were saving to debut on Thursday Campus Night, and which, of course, you ruined the second you stepped away from the bar. The sexy enby bartender definitely saw.
But the club you’re walking into isn’t the same that it used to be. ManRay NightClub originally opened in 1983, attached to another venue, Campus, which was a gay club. Therefore, at least initially, ManRay was LGBTQ+ adjacent. It was a place for the self-identified freaks and geeks, the goths and the sloths. They had more mainstream nights, New Wave and techno for the normies on Saturdays, but they also had nights for all kinds of weirdos (non-derogatory): BDSM and fetish nights, fashion shows, art exhibitions. It was a big deal. Nirvana played there once, and RuPaul took the stage years before Drag Race.
As Susan Welsh, ’87 puts it, “It was a little bit edgy for Cambridge back then. It wasn’t very edgy, it was a little edgy. Countercultural, subcultural, not mainstream. It was a little bit cool, and I liked to pretend to be cooler than I was.”
Welsh seems pretty cool to me, even just over the phone. When she was a student in Adams House — which she describes was “arty, gay, and hard-drinking” in the 80s — she was also a gogo dancer at ManRay. Every Friday night, she danced on the stage in an acrylic cage for four hours.
In 1986, Welsh was quoted in the Crimson saying, "I wonder, when I'm middle-aged will I still have this same fascination with nightlife and teen boogie?" And Welsh did keep boogying. Cambridge, not as much.
Two decades later, ManRay closed its doors. It wasn’t for any good or glamorous reason — the building’s owner wanted to turn the space into apartments. A 2005 auction ad in the Boston Globe listed the wares they were left to sell: nightclub sound and lighting systems, smoke machines, gothic decor, six disco balls, fetish/dungeon equipment. A month later, self-proclaimed club kid Emily Sweeney eulogized her favorite venue in the Globe’s “Last Word” column. She mourned their pregame rituals, their cab rides, the familiar crowd of drag queens, goth DJs, gay boys, and queer girls. She mourned the longest spiked hair anyone’s ever seen, the purple and black striped tights, the pinstriped pants and studded belts. On Sweeney’s way out of her beloved ManRay for the last time, she said to her friends: “ManRay, this exact place, will always be open… in our hearts.” She added, “I was shooting for sardonicism as I grinned and placed my hands over my chest in an overly dramatic gesture — but I meant it.”
Sweeney’s prescient optimism was an exercise in delayed gratification. There were a few false starts on the road to ManRay’s resurrection — it seemed like the club might re-open in 2009, and then again in 2013. Red tape got in the way each time. A recent editorial in the Globe credits owner Don Holland’s relentless persistence for ManRay’s long-awaited rise from the ashes, finally reopening in January of this year to those familiar throngs around the block.
Everyone was talking about ManRay. Obviously I was going to end up there. The first night I went, I didn’t know what to expect. The building itself is on an otherwise nondescript corner in Central. My friends and I are slaying down the block. We know where we’re going. We look hot. Slay past the boys smoking outside. Slay right by the bouncer and their mohawk. Slay through coat check, slay our way straight to the middle of the dance floor, through the double doors. A sparkly feeling starts in my tummy and spreads down my arms and legs. I see bodies and lights. Everything is happening inside me and outside me at once. We follow the light of the disco ball like it's our beacon. It is our beacon. We close our eyes and raise our arms and walk in time to the beat.
ManRay hasn’t been open for years, but the music is the same. The DJs are the same. The rules are the same. The feeling in the pit of your stomach is the same. The new is just the old and the present is just the past. Queer is no longer a slur. I like seeing the old queers! I think they like seeing us too. DJ Chris Ewens tells me outside between puffs of a cigarette that he’s ready to school us new kids on the block on the ManRay lifestyle and tunes.
It seems that Cambridge club kids, young and old, are relieved and enthused by the return of a genuinely popping spot to the otherwise sleepy Central Square. Welsh is certainly delighted to hear that there are still dancers on the pedestals. She tells me that her gogo application process was impromptu — she was simply recruited from the crowd. Yes, I did quake with envy to hear that. Somebody’s brother worked there, and helped her seal the deal. She loved taking on the personality, she loved the tease, but mostly she just loved to dance. She still loves to dance. When I asked her what exactly she liked about it, she couldn’t put her finger on it — maybe because it’s just so obvious. “I’ve always been a little bit exhibitionistic,” she says with a shrug.
The only thing Susan didn’t like about the job was the physical drain. When you’re up in the cage, you can’t just sit down when you want a break, or sneak off for a moment of solace in the bathroom stall. Welsh was quoted in her 1986 Crimson profile saying, “At times, I wonder if I shouldn't just blow it off and have normal Saturday nights like everyone else, go to Pudding parties or something. But this way I get $40, and that way all I get is a hangover.”
I’m pretty sure I’m going to be hungover tomorrow, but I don’t really care. I’m having a blast on the dance floor. My friend is having a blast on the dance floor. Surrounded by tall men, gays from (guess where) Provincetown. My friend looks so cute in their dark green T-shirt. They look happy but actually, mostly, they look free. Uninhibited. I want to eat them up. We go back-to-back and bounce our butts together. I want to take a shot. They want to take a shot. We get two shots. The bartender is out of salt. We grimace and toss them back. What can you do?
It’s the Art of Nightlife. That’s actually how ManRay has been describing itself since the beginning. I roll my eyes, but I can’t deny it. It’s the archetype. It’s the destination. It’s the piss on the toilet seat.

“It’s easier to imagine the end of [Poptropica.com] than the end of capitalism.” — Mark Fisher
I have dreamt of flying: up over the city and between the clouds, chasing a woman with spiky pink hair who flies beyond me, just out of reach. She is called Betty Jetty. I am an eight-year-old video game character named Shifty Hamburger. How did we get here?
Poptropica was a free browser-based game created by Jeff Kinney, the author of “Diary of a Wimpy Kid.” You played as a randomly generated six- to 15-year-old who traveled by blimp between a number of self-contained worlds (“islands”). By finding inventive uses for gathered objects, solving puzzles, and helping strangers with odd jobs, you completed each island’s plotline and racked up as many medallions (the reward for doing so) as possible. It was contradictory, dense, and deeply weird, and for most of my childhood — really, most of my life — I was obsessed.
This was a result of where I had landed in the uncanny valley of the internet, born too late to be a Tumblr girl and too early to be an iPad kid. What we had instead was this game where knowing the right sequence of people to talk to and services to exchange could land you on reality TV or the moon.
I could explain what this looked like to my elementary-school self in the form of a list: of the hegemonic cultural tropes the game dipped into to streamline exposition (pirate island, Wild West island, feudal Japan island), or the Poptropica-specific tropes that recurred across worlds (opaque incentives, plot-twist villains, lots of exploration), or the social phenomena that mediated them (huddling in hallways and after-school programs to determine who had solved what parts of which quest). But you have to see it for yourself.
The first time I kissed someone — sorry, God — it was a boy named Kyle with whom I co-owned a Poptropica account. My summers were spent squatting underneath my grandparents’ dining table, hidden by its draped plastic cover, dodging Betty Jetty’s energy attacks on the old PC my Ye Ye hadn’t yet convinced himself to get rid of. It was old enough that instead of a trackpad there was this nipply red circle in the center of the keyboard that you pressed your finger into to move the mouse around; and I was young enough to feel like I was the one flying.

In the real world, children have very little power. And for media interested in telling stories about children, this is a problem. How do you give a powerless character narrative agency? Some plots resolve this with luck (say, you stumble upon a ticket to a chocolate factory) or inheritance (say, you are the bastard son of a Greek god) or wishful thinking (say, you live in a world without capitalism). Video games might still allow you to participate in economies through an artificial restriction of latitude, as in the Pokémon franchise, where you can amass nearly limitless wealth and clout as long as they further your narrow goal of capturing weird little animals.
Instead, Poptropica ignores the question entirely. Your goals are as wide and varied as the narrative requires. While capitalism shapes the places you explore, it does not shape you. You might find a five-dollar bill stuck in a tree, exchange it for a sports drink at the general store, and give the drink to a thirsty gardener in return for his shears — but for narrative purposes, the bill could have been any other object of similar value, and other than in rare moments like these, you do not interact with money at all. The game is profoundly uninterested in explaining why your character can jump, barter, and wheedle their way into saving the world.
For me, as a kid, this was the coolest thing ever. Not only was this a world in which I could realize my long-held dreams of living in a walkable city, owning a laser sword, and being a girl, but this was a world in which doing so was normal, rather than subversive enough to require internal justification. To be conferred agency without first having obtained status, experience, or capital meant something that I did not yet have the words to express.
Still, I want to acknowledge that this is a ridiculous, indefensible panegyric for a game that does not deserve half as much; anyway, if children’s media cannot be art, and video games doubly cannot be art, then what is the point of this kind of analysis? I am obviously not suggesting that the people who made Poptropica did so with consciously political intent. I am only, as anyone ever is, trying to explain how something used to make me feel.
***
And what that feeling was. It followed me into high school, where every three to six months in social studies or my friends’ bedrooms, I would check back in on my old character, looking alongside her for something I couldn’t quite find. The feeling followed me into the beginning of the pandemic, where I would spend hours at once lying on the floor, clicking through forums and Flash games that I remembered from when I was younger, riding their diminishing waves of nostalgia. But eventually it stopped.
When Adobe discontinued Flash Player a couple years ago, Poptropica ported a few of the newer islands to a different software and deleted most of the old ones. (You can buy some of the deleted content for $20 on Steam.) I was replaying Mythology Island (2010), a favorite of many of my childhood friends and one of the few “classic islands” to have survived the transition from Flash. In that transition, I realized eventually, its edges had been sanded down to make the gameplay more linear. Challenging puzzles had been removed; instead of letting the player explore on their own terms, characters gave you important items and told you exactly where and when to use them.
This oversimplification — not just its fact, but the lack of acknowledgment that it had happened at all — was what drove me away. I thought about how you can buy something that should last forever and know it might last closer to two years, and that the thing you replace it with may have a life even shorter than that. Think of home appliances, or Apple devices, or clothing, which are built to stop working but are otherwise indistinguishable from older versions of themselves. Or think of a piece of media that you return to year after year for the faith it puts in your own agency, and which you discover, on one such occasion, has changed from a work of unwittingly radical fiction into something like a consumer product. What does that say about its continued existence? And what might it say about you?
***
In Super Power Island (2008), you are the vigilante tasked with apprehending six implausibly named criminals who have gained superpowers and broken out of prison. Some of them are obviously bad guys — like Copy Cat, who clones herself to rob a bank, or Sir Rebral, who levitates huge rocks and hurls them at civilians — but their ringleader, Betty Jetty, is not. Her file notes that she is wanted for “flying without a license,” and when you hunt her down, indeed, this is all that she is doing.
It took me a while to realize I was jealous: of Betty Jetty, for one thing, but also of the distance between her character and mine, of losing the chase scene and restarting it over and over in anticipation of a different result, of the idea that we might reach that spectacular future from this speculative present. One name for this is planned obsolescence; another is longing. For years, anyway, I didn’t remember what happened when you actually caught her. What had stayed with me was the moment of flight.

On the evening of Jan. 23, students erected a snow phallus in Tercentenary Theatre. At precisely 7:39 a.m. the next morning — or so claims Sidechat — a University tractor neutered the sculpture.
The entire saga was chronicled by users on the Harvard message board on Sidechat, an anonymous social media platform for college students. The news cycle started with an image of the snow penis, captioned “Cum to the yard, pretty average sized cock,” and came to a climax with a picture of the bulldozer in action, captioned “Rest in Penis - January 24, 7:39 a.m.”
First taking off at Harvard last spring, Sidechat rapidly gained conversational relevance. Content on the app runs the gamut of Harvard life, from funny to deadly serious: digs at HUDS, rants about final club punch season, snapshots of Remy the cat being chased by turkeys, lists of “gem” classes; but also discussions about mental health struggles, sexual assault on campus, and global political events. The app’s anonymity enables users to make out-of-pocket jokes and start difficult conversations without inhibition or repercussion.
As the snow penis saga shows Sidechat bridges the gap between the physical spaces we inhabit and the Harvard that anonymous posters construct in digital spaces. Posted and upvoted on Sidechat, the snow dick is transported from Tercentenary Theatre into the theaters of our collective consciousness, marked as a mildly significant event in the daily play of college life, bringing us together into shared spaces even if we never see the sculpture with our own eyes.
Deadpan, ironic humor pervades Sidechat. The world simply feels smaller and more manageable — a Harvard akin to the university of our fantasies — when others’ goofy experiences at this large, mythic school align with our own. Sidechat allows us to imagine an institution more socially coherent than the insular circles we traverse daily. Harvard doesn’t lack communities plural so much as it lacks a unified, identifiable community, a void that Sidechat seeks to fill. And, for many, it has stepped in for The Crimson as the first source of campus-related news.
The concept of the “nation” first formed when the printing press was invented, scholar Benedict Anderson argues in his book “Imagined Communities,” because large groups of people opening the same newspaper every morning had a new sense of coexistence. Now Sidechat has, in its speed and informality, at times overshadowed student newspapers’ accounting of life at Harvard. Beautiful sunsets, cataloged on Sidechat before fading, create a sense of shared immediacy that a newspaper just can’t capture.
To be sure, there’s a good reason that The Crimson doesn’t cover every little event. Newspapers are necessary as a stable medium for nuanced discussion on political and social issues. And social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok do a better job than an anonymous platform like Sidechat at putting users in contact But unlike other platforms, where algorithms curate posts to each individual user, every Sidechat user sees the same posts in their feed, acknowledging and creating a shared experience.
Anderson calls nations “imagined communities” because “the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion.” Sidechat strengthens our sense of belonging within the imagined community that is Harvard College. Its posts form the elements of school myth, spirit, culture, and controversy.
Myth: classes with squads of scooters parked outside are filled with athletes and therefore must be “gems.”
Spirit: “Y’all losing your scooter privileges” was upvoted 693 times to date after Harvard lost to Yale in the Game.
Culture: “Going to Harvard gives you 4 years of inferiority complex for a lifetime of superiority complex.”
Controversy: “These frosh are making WAITLISTS for their blocking groups??? Bring bullying back fr.” These posts are familiar, funny, upsetting, and above all recognizably Harvard.
Sidechat ensures this affinity by limiting access: Users log into the app, which advertises itself as “Your college’s private community,” with their Harvard emails. Other pages on Sidechat exist for other universities. Nations are, Anderson notes, “inherently limited.” Consequently, Sidechat can have very material community-building impacts. According to Sidechat legend, people occasionally meet each other on the app’s chatboard, which allows users to have private conversations, and liaise in person. Its clear targeted audience also helps spread student-specific information and initiatives; during winter break, students promoted a GoFundMe raising money to send their roommate’s sister to high school.
This system of upvotes means that Sidechat seems quite democratic. No algorithm promotes certain posts above others; if a post appears at the top of our feeds, it’s because enough of our peers find it entertaining.
But there’s an undeniable illusion here. The top post of all time on Harvard Sidechat (an image of a student smoking next to Dean Rakesh Khurana) currently has at least 1,000 upvotes, equivalent to around one in seven Harvard undergrads. Anonymity allows individual experiences to masquerade as general public opinion so long as it has upvotes. The community formed on Harvard Sidechat is, indeed, at least partially imagined.
Anonymous platforms are, by virtue of their format, geared toward the kind of mythmaking that makes communities feel bigger and yet cohesive. School spirit is like patriotism on a smaller scale: powerful, moving, joyous, treacherous. The make-Remy-our-school-mascot movement on Sidechat is innocent, even if Remy’s supporters are beefing with the Yard turkey apologists. But, to usethe athlete-scooter myth: while funny, relatable, and potentially contains a kernel of truth, it is also at risk of causing or exacerbating tensions between segments of the student body.
Using Anderson’s ideas about nationhood to understand Harvard Sidechat means that we can use Sidechat to understand how anonymous platforms operate within America as a whole. YikYak, an app that makes anonymous discussion threads available to people within a five-mile radius of one another, is a Sidechat equivalent on other college campuses. Even on Facebook, where people are identified by name, users create “tea” pages like Harvard Confessions to anonymously post gossip that can shift quickly into bullying. Anonymous forums like 4chan and 8chan have, in the past 20 years, played an important role in our political landscape, fomenting the nationalist mythmaking movements that led to the Jan. 6 insurrection.
Sidechat and similar platforms might be constructive to the communities they represent, but they are also dangerous. It’s easy to focus on scooters and mascots, easy to ignore the conflict simmering below the surface as you scroll, and scroll, and scroll.

Valentine’s Day season is upon us, and with it comes a slew of paper hearts, cheesy pick-up lines, and windowsill roses. For Josh, our favorite perpetually confused eternal freshman, who is processing the end of a relationship this February, the red and pink cheer only serves as a reminder of all that’s been lost. So, FM asked some of our writers: what would you tell a heartbroken Josh?
***
Remember that healing does not take a specific form or follow a specific timeline. Allow yourself the space to grieve, to reminisce, to fume; to cry, to laugh, to vent; in short, to feel. Allow the unpredictable waves of despair and bitterness to wash over you, knowing that what comes up must come down, knowing that you will not drown, knowing that, with time, the tides will cease. And above all, surround yourself with those who love you, with sunsets and fresh air, with art and movement, with what brings you joy and makes you feel cared for and alive. Love is abundant and constant; you just have to know where to look.

You will try everything. You’ll aggressively work out to an angry playlist, you’ll accidentally go off the grid for a few days, you’ll cry in front of people you don’t want to cry around, you’ll send stupid texts and make bad decisions and start wondering how long this will take. None of it will feel as satisfying as you want it to. The thing is, you won’t quite see the end coming until it does. One day, you’ll find that you’ve gone an hour without thinking of them.

Helen L. Piltner ’25 is known as a Harvard influencer.
As of February 2023, Piltner has amassed more than 38,000 subscribers on Youtube — her main social media platform — as well as 6,500 followers on Instagram and 1,000 on TikTok.
Piltner isn’t the first student to post college lifestyle content. In the past decade, this trend has swept across the University, with students taking to various social media platforms to document their lives on campus. At Harvard, the University name draws intrigue to viewers seeking a more intimate look into what goes on behind the Ivy League gates.
Most of Piltner’s videos rack up tens of thousands of views, but by far the most successful remains her college decision reaction video, which has been watched more than one million times.
“I think a lot of high school students, they’re really looking forward to moving on to a new chapter of their life — going on to the college experience,” she says. “A lot of people turn to YouTube. That’s what I did.”
Piltner’s content allows her to capture her life in college and has been met with support from inspired high school students. But it has also faced skepticism from those on and off campus. As college life presents its own challenges, Piltner is still figuring out her place as a student with a public platform.
Capturing College Life 
For Piltner, the decision to become a campus influencer stemmed from her high school self’s fascination with college lifestyle videos, particularly at Ivy League schools. The inside perspective provided by college Youtubers served as a source of motivation and inspiration for Piltner in high school, and now she hopes to continue that cycle.
“I kind of wanted to take on that role if I got that amazing opportunity to go to a really good college,” she says. “Now that I have the opportunity, I just want to use this platform as a way to continue motivating high schoolers.”
Occasionally, Piltner will meet younger students on campus who watched her videos in high school and then experienced the joys of being accepted for themselves.
“I’ve had freshmen at this school come up to me and say, ‘Well, you’re the reason why I chose Harvard,’ and it’s very heartwarming to hear,” she says.“That motivates me to continue doing what I do.”
Though Piltner makes an effort to be genuine with her content, the mission to provide a window into life at Harvard is an inherently difficult one. After all, social media is a highlight reel, and Piltner’s Youtube channel is often no different.
“Obviously I want to be really nice and presentable, but I’m gonna show the reality of what it’s like to go here,” she says.
She adds, however, “If I’m going through a really hard day — going through high stress or if I’m having a breakdown — I’m not going to pull out my camera.”
“I try not to let it take over my normal day-to-day activities,” she says. “I don’t pull out my camera 24/7 trying to film a video because at the end of the day, I’m here for an education and my relationships with my friends here are important.”
‘Clout Chasing’
Life as an influencer — both online and on campus — isn’t always easy. Online, Piltner faces the scrutiny of faceless audiences behind keyboards.
For Piltner, it comes in the form of “random trolls making weird assumptions about you,” she says. After Piltner shared her acceptance to Harvard and other top universities online, a torrent of theories came flooding in.
“People can’t believe someone from rural South Georgia made it here,” she says. “People have assumed that the only reason why I got into Harvard is because I come from a rich family or I went to a private school. Neither are true.”
In a video Piltner made in 2021 about her high school grades, test scores, and extracurricular activities, some viewers took to the comments to question Piltner’s motives.
“This is just an excuse for an overachiever to let the world know how ‘great’ they are. I find that all these people who actually upload their stats etc on YouTube are just looking for recognition now that they go to a university where they are no longer special,” one wrote.
Countless students at Harvard have made similar videos, revealing their high school GPAs and accomplishments in an effort to guide prospective students through the college application process — though ultimately the admission decisions process is still shrouded in mystery.
Even within the Harvard bubble, Piltner says, many students have disdain for the work social media influencers do, accusing them of using the Harvard brand to gain money and fame.
“I know that a lot of upperclassmen have said negative things about the influencers on campus because they view them as clout chasers in a way, using the Harvard name,” she says.
Still, to Piltner, the difference between “clout chasing” and simply making honest content comes from the affiliation to Harvard. While outside Youtubers might come specifically to campus to capitalize off of the intrigue around so-called elite schools and their students, influencers who attend the University necessarily make content associated with it.
“I think it’s pretty well known that having a name like Harvard — or some elite school — will attract views,” Piltner says. “So it’s no secret.”
“At the end of the day, I don’t care about the haters,” she adds.
Stepping In
Despite the hate, being an online influencer certainly comes with benefits. On average, Piltner earns a few hundred dollars from each YouTube video she creates and posts. But she says it’s not the revenue that inspires her work.
“For me, it’s not just about making the money,” she says. “It’s really seeing the impact it has made on other people — that’s just really inspiring for me.”
At first, Piltner navigated the influencer world on her own, including everything from video production to sponsorships. Now, she works with the agency Station Entertainment, which helps manage her brand deals.
As she continued profiting from ads and brand deals, Piltner thought about how she would share her success. At the beginning of this year, she settled on a plan: Buy each of her teammates on the Harvard Crimson Dance Team a matching pair of Nike Jordan sneakers.
Piltner says she had been considering the possibility of gifting her teammates new merch for a while, but the idea solidified in her mind during the team’s recent trip to Florida for nationals.
“We see all these other college dance teams competing with their amazing gear, costumes, and their warm-up suits, and then I see so many people with matching Jordans and Dunks,” she says. “I’m like, ‘Wow, like, that looks amazing! Wouldn’t that be so good if the Harvard dance team had them?’”
Still, the decision was not made lightly. The Jordan 1s that Piltner wanted cost over one hundred dollars each, and buying 10 pairs would tack another zero onto the price tag. Ultimately, Piltner says she decided to buy the shoes to show her appreciation for the friendships she has made on the dance team.
“I really wanted to surprise my teammates. They’ve done a lot for me,” she says.
One morning, she asked her teammates to get to practice early, keeping the details intentionally vague so as to not spoil the surprise. When her teammates walked into the gym, the shoes — red and black to match Harvard colors — were met with delight.
The Harvard Crimson Dance Team’s Instagram account posted a short clip of the team’s reaction on its story, which Piltner then also reposted on her own personal account.
Piltner says she didn’t buy the sneakers solely for the purpose of making content, but she still plans to post a video on Youtube capturing the team’s reaction to the shoes.
In navigating the social media realm, Piltner has found solidarity among other influencers on campus, talking about the experience of creating content, being recognized, and even being hated.
“It’s really nice to just have other people to relate to on campus,” she says. “There are not that many content creators.”
In the coming year, Piltner hopes to move away from the classic “day-in-the-life” videos that are staples of college Youtubers.
“I also want to put a new twist on my channel and come up with new ideas, like maybe film something that no one has ever filmed before,” she says. “For example, filming a dorm tour of all the Harvard freshman dorms.”
After college, Piltner sees social media remaining an important piece of her life.
Hoping to go into the biotechnology industry, Piltner is proud of her work on Youtube and anticipates making daily vlogs of her life as a young professional.
“I wouldn’t want to give it up,” she says.

I felt resentful about the rain at first. It was the wreckage of my prayer for Tyre Nichols. I wanted a sunset. Dripping down the sky and skating across the horizon, for Tyre. I wanted the sun. Blanketing my grief with a divine hallelujah, spread across the skyline with an unbroken stretch of hope, reaching worlds over. Instead, we got the rain: clouded, murky, and miserable. Yet as I walked toward Tercentenary Theatre for Tyre’s vigil, I found myself resonating with the sky. She, too, was crying. She was hovering over my grief, and the grief of my people, in solidarity. Then, I wondered, why is it that even when the sky cries with me, it isn’t enough? Why is it that even when the clouds share in my anguish, the burden I carry feels no less heavy?
There is something perpetual about Black death, for me. Something claustrophobic and inescapable and choking, something unbreathable and violent and bleak. That even if all the world were to cry, even if the earth’s screams could exorcize the misery of my innocence lost so young and the heartache that comes with every Black life taken, it wouldn’t be enough. For the bullets would continue raining and the concomitant silence would drown us in the blasphemy that nothing ever happened at all.
I have felt more numbed than astonished by it as of late. In the past, to see Black death, to hear of it, was all-consuming: a wave that reached just below heaven before it came crashing down on me. I felt powerless to do anything but watch it, powerless to do anything but grieve it. And just a few feet away, I could see another wave, ready to drown me in grief all over again. It was frightening, and it was ceaseless. And such permanence and inexorability have hardened my heart.
I’ve been told not to grow weary, to shove away the whispers of exhaustion, as I would an incessant fly. I’ve been told that I don’t have time to grieve for long, that it is my obligation to fight emotional fatigue and suppress weariness. In the back of my head often buzzes the notion that if I allow my pain the liberty of being felt, it will consume me; it will slow my progress and my fervor for justice.
The same buzzing, I’ve found, vibrates through these ivy-covered walls — in culture, more than in law. No one has necessarily told me that I cannot feel, nor have they forced me to suppress my pain. Yet a clock seems to hang over my grief. Even at the vigil, I heard whispers of looming meetings hovering over some people, like white noise muffling the sound of their grief screaming for catharsis. They had somewhere to be, something to lead, someone they owed something. So they packaged their grief away because they felt like they had to. I wondered, then, what it would be like if even when we had to, we didn’t.
The capitalist clock, more often than not, binds my Blackness. And in times of Black grief, it dawns on me in an uncannily frightening way. The glass ceilings, built to exclude and oppress my people, have made their way into my heart and my mind. They confine my catharsis to a moment in time, my mourning to a schedule, my humanity to a transactional politic, marketed by a mass email assuring all eyes that thoughts and prayers did, or will at one point, center Black grief. And then the clock chimes, insisting the end of my grief, expecting production as usual. The violent silence prevails once again, and we wait, numbly, for the next wave to come crashing down.
But sorrow does not exit at the ring of a bell. At the closing of a ceremony, grief does not leave me. It comes in waves by nature. And in the case of Black death, the ability to suppress each wave fluctuates. Even in times of numbness, pain only lies dormant, waiting for the whispered allowance of catharsis. Or, it lies in a kind of desensitization, slowly eating away at my humanity.
Suppression is not a solution; it’s not some radicalized ideal of strength and bravery and sacrifice. It’s inauthenticity and alienation and poison. It’s claustrophobic and unbreathable and choking. It is a loss, a denial of your humanity. It is, in itself, a kind of Black death. Therefore, emotional expression is a kind of resistance; catharsis is akin to liberation. In the act of taking space to grieve, I’ve learned, is the art of welcoming my whole humanity. There, sounds the whispers of revolution.
Tyre Nichols’ vigil was a place of crying and breathing, of sharing in community even if you had nothing left to give. Our time together honoring his life closed with a song and a final word. But even after, many of us lingered. We held each other, in a sense. And we stayed, sitting in our lamentation for a little while longer. There was something powerful about that act — liberating our lingering grief.
There were points during and after the vigil, however, when it felt like people couldn’t spend any more time grieving. There seemed to be a sense that one’s schedules, plans, and meetings could not bear the weight of their healing. At that moment, I wished for time, but I also wished for strength. Strength to choose humanity whenever and wherever I could. Strength to break the capitalist clock; to paint, to write, to call my beautiful Black family; to cry, to sleep, to sit in a comforting silence; to cook, to shop, to laugh, and to laugh more. To put aside what is expected of me and liberate my lingering grief.
Grief comes in waves, by nature. And with each wave, I wish for the time to lament. I wish, also, for the strength to liberate whatever lingers when the capitalist clock chimes.

On my 21st birthday, I spoke on a Sex Week panel called “Race and Relationships.” Oversharing to an audience of strangers fit seamlessly into the celebrations — it was the holy grail of an activity, one that would allow me to channel my affinity for silly exhibitionism into something actually meaningful. My friend was moderating the panel, and together, we pranced from brunch at Blue Bottle to Boylston Hall. We were excited to commune with peers who were similarly submerged in the muddy waters of desirability politics. Perhaps narcissistically, we were also excited that the takes we’d developed while procrastinating might finally have a broader audience.
My friend’s first question cut straight to the point: “Have you ever felt fetishized?”
For me, the answer was yes, but. Yes, but sometimes it’s more of a rumor than fact. Yes, but the associated shame often derives more from what being fetishized signifies socially than from the fetishization itself. Yes, but the feeling can vary drastically from instance to instance, in gravity or urgency, and popular discourse doesn’t offer a space to explore that unevenness.
But the first answer made me wonder if my planned bid for nuance was a thinly veiled admission of weakness. A panelist responded to the prompt with: “I’ve never personally been fetishized because I don’t allow that to happen to me. I kind of have an aura that prevents it.”
Suddenly, at a forum intended to inspire honesty and empathy, I was grateful that the mic would pass through a few more people before it got to me. I didn’t want to be the first to admit that I gave off a different, more penetrable, more fetishizable aura. Answering “yes” to being fetishized transformed from a moment of vulnerability to a deflection of responsibility. And when I said it, I had the disheartening realization that I was embarrassed.
***
The night before the panel, I’d done some reflecting on anecdotes from my young adulthood, mining them for commentary beyond the idea of racial preferences as simply being harmful. Over the years, I — like most women of color — had accumulated a small but nagging reservoir of romantic and sexual experiences that seemed racialized. A few were so on the nose that they felt like caricatures.
When I was newly 18, still tentatively, shakily stepping into my sexuality, a guy reassured me after our botched attempt at a one-night stand: It’s okay; it’s always harder for Asian girls at first, but don’t worry, that means it’s better in the long run.
Even then, I knew his assertion was ridiculous. My friends and I couldn’t stop laughing over the implication that he must’ve taken the virginity of every Asian girl in the world in order to understand their anatomy so perfectly. He fell, without a doubt, into the camp of men who hold damaging ideas about Asian women and who should therefore be blacklisted from the pool of viable hookup options.
Stories like these abound — in online think pieces about the dangers of “yellow fever,” in critiques of films that unabashedly cast Asian women as dragon ladies or lotus blossoms, in historical analyses of how the Opium Wars birthed the mythology of tight Asian vaginas. These stories are old news by now. We all know that Asian women are fetishized interpersonally and culturally, and we know that it is bad.
On a liberal college campus, racial fetishization is as ubiquitous as it is universally maligned. News of yellow fever is nothing more than gossip — or, if you run into an acquaintance at a party and she shouts over the music to tell you who she’s hooking up with, a bit of bad news to deliver with the appropriate amount of pity and a dash of cringe. It’s rarely the subject of prolonged discussion. What is there to say? If the historical roots and cultural persistence of fetishization are obvious, the prescription for when it happens is even more so. Being fetishized is blatant and offensive. Its possibility lurks in every first kiss, every nervous butterfly, and every midnight booty call. Its subjects, then, should steel their auras against it.
But as I reflected on my own relationship to racial fetishization, I discovered that it was overwhelmingly forged through ambiguity: ambiguous interactions, ambiguous responses, and ambiguous feelings. The instances that prompted my immediate, visceral disgust felt secondary to the instances that left me uncertain, on the precipice of being shoved into a tired cultural script but clinging to the hope that I’d hold my ground.
Once, a friend brought up that a guy I’d been seeing had a reputation for yellow fever. She joked, “Time for you to put that one to bed!” A clear solution to a clear infraction. Her tone carried a loaded yikes, the accusation that I had, indeed, heard this before and hadn’t yet put it to bed after all. She was right, and in the group setting we were in, I flushed with shame. It felt like the wrong time to divulge that I’d agonized over the rumors for months.
As far as I could tell, these were the facts: He’d hooked up with a few Asian women, but also a few more non-Asian women. The mere presence of Asian women mixed into someone’s dating history — the incriminating evidence that my friends had pointed to — didn’t register as a cause for concern in itself. I wanted to be cautious and discerning. Still, some of the warnings seemed to pulse with an almost smug incredulity — disbelief that Asian women could unproblematically be subjects of desire. It was like a paranoia towards racial fetishes had led to the collective internalization of the assumptions that undergird them. Because we’re aware of Orientalism’s deep and expansive roots, desire for Asian women is difficult to imagine as untainted by fantasies of sexual submissiveness, exoticism, or danger. I’ve fought the urge to insist, No, why can’t you imagine that he just likes me because he thinks I’m hot? The irony, of course, is that I’d probably want to say those same words to a guy with yellow fever. Why can’t you just like me because you think I’m hot?
Being fetishized can feel like the invalidation of your desirability: You’re chosen on the basis of stereotypes associated with your race, not your unique individual assets. What’s less acknowledged is that the constant projection of fetishization onto your body can feel like that, too.
This is what my ideal self would’ve said back then, to my friend or on the panel. But the line between merited inquiry and making excuses is razor-thin; I’m still trying to walk it. Obviously, I don’t want to defend racial fetishization as okay, but I’m not very concerned with the act of fetishizing at all. Instead, I want to explore the embodiment of being racially fetishized — one that may be more capacious than the focus on subjugation and demands for personal defensiveness allow for.
***
For my senior thesis, I’ve interviewed 20 women who make their livelihoods through inhabiting this embodiment. The work of Asian woman porn performers articulates the linkage of Asian femininity and sexual desire more explicitly, more vividly, than would be acceptable in any other form of media. Arguably, they don’t just articulate it. They amplify and reinforce it. From deploying Asian-related keywords to wearing ethnic garb, many of these women solicit an experience that others condemn as a primary source of violence. Being fetishized emerges as a powerful means toward capital.
Still, despite all my pontificating on ambiguities, the act of browsing PornHub’s Asian category feels unambiguously alienating. I wince at the unabashed invocation of stereotypes and slurs, at the use of the adjective “Asian” as a signifier of eroticism. If I was disgusted by the Asian virginity expert who alluded to tight Asian vaginas, how do I write about women who market themselves through “Asian pussy”?
Taking my interlocutors’ self-articulations seriously, then, has required that I resist the impulse to resent them for validating power dynamics that nauseate me. It’s an exercise in looking at instances of racial fetishization that appear the least ambiguous, the most plainly victimizing, and excavating what might be invisibly complex about them. The women’s narratives often brim with a bristling awareness of these complexities. Most of them know that the visual fact of their undulating bodies carries social significance, regardless of whether they lean into their Asian-ness or not. Some of them feel guilt, some feel uncertainty, some feel indignance, and some feel empowered to capitalize on a part of them that would likely be fetishized anyway. Many feel a tangle of these emotions at once.
These conversations have forced me to consider being fetishized as a messy, lived-in thing, irreducible to a single axis of value or harm. For Asian woman porn performers, it brings discomfort but also money; frustration but also reclamation.

When I was little, I wished that I was white. I valorized Eurocentric beauty standards and believed that the coveted status of crushed-upon was reserved only for those who met them. But at some point, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction and stayed there. Still kneeling at the altar of vanity, I became supremely glad that I was Asian.
Maybe it was around the beginning of college when I found myself in a more diverse and social friend group than I’d ever been in. We were obsessed with the obnoxious idea that we could be hot girls who went to Harvard. Leaning into this required that we were confident in our desirability, individually and together — or at least, that we told ourselves we were. Over time, my confidence settled; it grew less exaggerated and less performative. Certain mindsets naturalized from aspirational to real: I felt uniquely not insecure relative to white women. White beauty standards were unappealing to me. I loved how I looked, and I loved being Asian. Those two things weren’t causal but inextricable. I didn’t love how I looked because I was Asian, but obviously being Asian had something to do with it. Many women of color I know can identify this precise boomerang in their own self-esteem.
Only recently have I considered the specifics of what it means to revel in my Asian-ness as beautiful. Iterations of this self-love mantra are common and uncontroversial, a defiant response to the hegemony of whiteness. These days, thank God, I think that the features I would’ve chosen to swap out as a kid are better than the ones I yearned for. I find pleasure, power, satisfaction in my almond eyes and small stature, my dark hair and tan skin.
That last sentence, I’ve realized, must have always been implicit in the kind of racialized confidence that’s buoyed me throughout college. But to write it out is jarring. Frankly, it echoes the ramblings of a racist guy with yellow fever posting to a scary Reddit thread. If a sexual partner were to ever mention those traits, I would be horrified.
And yet, the sentence remains true for me. I look in the mirror; I see an Asian girl; I think that’s hot.
This, I suspect, is one of the trickiest parts of desire. We want our sexualities to be pure. Any association of race with sexuality is immediately tainting, pathologizing — and much of the time, it should be. But if attraction is, in many cases, based on appearances — making eye contact across a bar, swiping on Hinge — then it’s also difficult to separate from race entirely. What someone looks like, and what makes them attractive, inherently includes race.
In my sophomore year, an Asian friend and I betrayed this to be our worldview without knowing we held it. We noticed that the guys who were into her had a monolithically different vibe than the guys who were into me. So half bitsy, half serious, we developed what we called our “Oriental question.” We wondered whether we embodied our respective Asian-ness differently, and whether that might explain the phenomenon. Maybe one of us was Asian in a sultry way, whereas the other was more of a bubbly Asian, we hypothesized. We asked for input from several acquaintances that we certainly were not close enough to ask.
For the purpose of this bit, Asian-ness was the locus of interrogation — not personality, not style. These factors only played a role insofar as they contributed to our speculatively distinct veins of Asian. Race, in other words, felt like a constitutive aspect of our desirability. It shaped how we conceived of boys conceiving of us — and, necessarily, how we conceived of ourselves in relation to them. The “Oriental question,” then, could easily be characterized by an outsider as an outgrowth of defeated acceptance.
But honestly, we found it all hilarious. We were fascinated and amused and occasionally flattered by people’s answers. The instinctive relationship we grasped between our Asian-ness and our desirability was the object of curiosity, even fun — even pleasure, in the most lighthearted and frivolous sense.
***
“I love sexy Asian women gyrating in bikinis on stage in Miss Saigon,” writes Celine Shimizu in the opening of her book, "The Hypersexuality of Race." “I love Asian women porn stars delivering silly lines in broken English while performing in dragon lady fingernails, long black wigs, and garish yellowface makeup that exaggerates slanted eyes.”
Shimizu is one of the only scholars to theorize the subjectivities of Asian women in pornographic films. Her book explores sexualized portrayals of Asian women through the analytic framework of “race-positive sexuality” — a way of understanding of the entanglement of race, sex, and representation that accounts for “their subjugating power but also the possibilities of their equally intense pleasure.”
That last part — the insistence on pleasure — is where Shimizu stakes her intervention in the literature. She claims that in spite of its historically violent origins, racialized sexuality can be a site of self-authored desire for Asian women, found in its performance or its consumption. Recognizing the potential for counterintuitive pleasure, she continues, allows us to recognize Asian women’s sexualities as vehicles for “powerful social critique.” It’s a kind of politicization that can only occur when we discard the “moralistic” lenses of racialized sexuality as pain, or pleasure in racialized sexuality as false consciousness.
I’m not sure that I agree with the extent to which Shimizu ascribes pleasure with political meaning — and especially the extent to which she casts Asian women’s bodies as laboratories for revolutionary sexual subjectivities. This is a decidedly non-academic gripe, more so a visceral, personal sense of indignance. I don’t want my sexuality to be socially meaningful or my pleasure to be politically important. That feels so laborious. I just want that particular part of life to be fun. I actively would not defend the Oriental question, or continuing to see the guy who may or may not have had yellow fever, or reveling in the Asian-ness of my sexuality as having anything to contribute to transformative sexual politics.
Still, Shimizu’s work gestures toward a truth that rarely feels kosher to explore beneath the dominant perspectives on racial fetishization. Race is always already formative in Asian women’s sexualities; sexuality, in turn, is “part of Asian American women’s everyday identities and subject formation,” she writes.
If all of this is true — and I’d wager that it is — then the relationship between race, sexuality, and desire can’t be solely constituted by shame. Instead, pleasure might exist there. There might be confusion, or ambivalence, or a fed-up refusal to think about any of this stuff.
In every thesis interview, I asked the performer how she grapples with the racial fetishization inherent to her job. One performer, who once made a video instructing viewers on how to fuck a pumpkin, responded, “Why can’t I just be in my body and have fun making silly pumpkin-fucking videos, without all of this other significance tied to me enjoying myself, enjoying my body?”
Sometimes, it seems like there are only two options: to be on guard against the diffuse creep of fetishization, or to accept your place within a depressing, centuries-long legacy of fetishized Asian women. But her question rejects a sexuality defined by the fantasies of Orientalism; it also rejects a sexuality defined by victimhood, paranoia, and the moral imperative to internalize both. She doesn’t insist on an external utility to her onscreen performances. In fact, she seems to hate it, “all of this other significance” — the consideration of her body as a political object that might give off some racially questionable aura, rather than a vessel for enjoyment that belongs to her alone.
Or maybe that’s me projecting. I wrote her quote down immediately — not in my thesis notes document, but in a random note on my phone titled “RELATABLE.” I exclaimed in agreement and thanked her for saying it. Because I, too, often just want to be in my body — a body that is most certainly Asian — and enjoy the pure embodied feeling of its desirability, guiltlessly and uninhibitedly, without explaining that to anyone at all.

Harvard Undergraduate Association presidential candidates Zachary J. Lech ’24 and Ivan O.A. Specht ’24 said, if elected, they aim to “free Harvard” by improving mental health resources, affordability, and social life.
The pair said their campaign for the presidency began with a conversation in the Quincy House dining hall about potential improvements to student unity and quality of life.
Lech, a Crimson Arts editor, served as a Lowell House Representative in the former Undergraduate Council, which was dissolved last year and replaced by the HUA. Lech also ran in the first HUA presidential election in spring 2022.
Specht is a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where he researches ways to implement infectious disease testing programs for underserved and at-risk groups.
In an interview, Specht said the pair are atypical candidates for the presidency due to their lack of current involvement in student government. Still, Specht said this discrepancy is an advantage in terms of appealing to the student body.
“If there’s anything that Harvard community has wanted to see — over the past couple of years especially — is people who are not intimately involved in government taking over,” Specht said. “Something that I certainly hope to bring to the HUA administration as well is getting a much wider variety of people involved in leadership.”
Specht said the ticket hopes to address mental health “first and foremost,” citing lengthy wait times at Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services. In March 2022, wait times for CAMHS appointments reached six weeks amid high demand.
“We will fight till it is accomplished that this wait time gets down to one or two weeks,” Specht said.
Lech and Specht’s campaign aims to make Harvard more affordable, citing “hidden fees” and high tuition costs in their campaign statement.
“One of the things that we want to focus on is the elimination of fees for things that we would certainly deem needless such as free laundry, free printing, free MBTA passes, as well as greater transparency around what our tuition money is actually going,” Specht said.
In their candidate statement, the pair wrote that they plan to implement more frequent shuttles on and off campus, including night shuttles to the Radcliffe Quadrangle and a shuttle to the airport around breaks.
To address accessibility issues, Lech and Specht wrote they would aim to “create a centralized funding database, a comprehensive support system for FGLI students, increase the number of advisors, and fight against unnecessary academic requirements — including Gen Eds.”
If elected, another priority for the pair is strengthening Harvard’s social scene.
“We’ll work with HoCos and student organizations on College-wide block, and house parties that students actually want to go to,” the pair wrote in the announcement. “We deserve fun events, traditions, and competitions — and a social scene that isn’t dominated by exclusivity.”
Lech said the pair would prioritize funding for organizations which have widespread impact across campus.
“As student government, you’re supposed to represent the whole of the student body, which means that what we spend should have an actual impact on the campus,” Lech said.
Lech said the co-presidency should be more than a role of “coordinators.”
“We are here to reimagine the HUA and reimagine Harvard,” he said.

Laila A. Nasher ’25 and Ethan C. Kelly ’25 have been friends since freshman year. Now, they’re joining heads in a campaign to lead the Harvard Undergraduate Association.
Nasher and Kelly pledge to improve student group funding by articulating “new financial guidelines” in the HUA budget for club funding, emergency funds, and an inaugural club funding portal, according to their website.
Kelly said the HUA ended last semester with $50,000 that could have been distributed to clubs.
“Part of the main reason why we wanted to run was to combat that level of discontent when it came down to club funding,” he said. “We wanted to ensure that the entire budget was being used.”
“Transparency is key. I think we put that at one of the main forefronts of our campaigns,” he added. “We have a vision when it comes down to club funding that in a sense is unmatched on the level of detail.”
Both Nasher and Kelly have gained leadership and mentorship experience through their work as student leaders of Harvard Primus — an organization for first generation, low income students — and the Leadership Institute for the First-Year Experience pre-orientation program, respectively.
Both sophomores boast strong ties to the FGLI community at Harvard. This past fall, Nasher helped organize the University’s inaugural First Generation Visibility Week.
“That’s where I felt like there was a very, very big gap in the sense that there are no institutionalized resources for first gen students,” she said. “But this also wasn’t really being heard in non-first gen spaces.”
“If we’re able to do this — having to advocate to admin on our own, one-on-one, without having this very large institutional backing behind us — why isn’t the HUA doing this?” Nasher added.
The ticket promises to organize “Occupy University Hall” protests, increase funding for affinity groups and provide safe sex materials to the Yard and every House, per their website.
“I think something that we’re really interested in doing with advocating for students is giving students a platform to advocate for themselves,” Nasher said. “We mean it when we say we want to make Harvard listen.”
Though there were questions regarding Title IX and inclusion in the HUA debates, Nasher said only their ticket included these issues in their platform.
“We were the only ones who had, actually, I feel listened to the current climate on campus,” Nasher said. “We didn’t decide to run and were like, ‘Okay, what are student issues?’ We saw the issues and we said, ‘Okay, now here’s a platform that we feel is best to actually address this.’”
“We’re ready to start these positions if elected,” Kelly said. “I think that we have the collective experience and overall platform to actually execute our vision — actually make a change on this campus and really do good for the student body.”

Cambridge Public Schools will offer universal pre-K to all Cambridge four-year-olds beginning in the 2024-2025 school year.
After years of preparation and research, the Cambridge City Council and CPS School Committee introduced the Cambridge Preschool Program in a roundtable meeting Tuesday night. The preschool program is set to guarantee access for all four-year-old children in Cambridge to the district’s six-hour-per-day programming.
The district organized an advisory committee, three task force groups, and an ad hoc committee of city and school officials and constituents to draft the program.
Lisa Grant, executive director of the Cambridge Office of Early Childhood, said the advisory groups focused on studying local demographics, parental priorities, and “what universal pre-K looks like around the country.”
“Throughout this process, we’ve been hyper-concerned and focused on making sure that we’re reaching our most under-resourced families — our families who need access to preschool the most,” Grant said.
The initial planning phase consisted of “a lot of data gathering,” according to Grant. Through the district’s research of programs around the country, CPS found that its pre-K system has an advantage due to the relatively small population of Cambridge.
“The unique advantage for us is that we’re small enough to really have a handle on our entire early childhood community and have a dedicated team of staff and resources to be able to implement this work,” Grant said.
The district worked with various organizations to develop the framework for the preschool program, including Harvard. Last year, CPS partnered with the University to conduct a citywide childcare workforce study, examining wage gaps among childhood educators. The impact of the study goes beyond the district by “informing the work in communities across the country,” Grant said.
The program has so far “every key benchmark,” according to Grant, and is on track for a fall 2024 launch. Currently, the district is developing a single enrollment application system for families, which is set to be released toward the end of the year.
“I can really see also that 2023 is going to be a really special year because I can see how much this is when we're moving from the planning phase into really making a lot of the changes in investments that are going to get us to a launch in fall of 2024,” City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 said.
While attendees of the roundtable discussion broadly supported the plan, many presented lingering concerns about the preschool program’s accessibility across age groups.
In its current form, the preschool program will offer its services to all children who are four years old prior to Sept. 1 each school year. While three-year-olds are still able to apply, they are not guaranteed a place in the program. To extend the program to all four-year-olds, the city plans to allocate an additional $20 million in funding.
“If the child is eligible to receive special education services or lives in a household below a certain income threshold or as other defined risk factors, then placement in Cambridge preschool program site would be prioritized,” Grant said. “Cambridge Preschool Program does not have the capacity to serve all three-year-olds at this time.”
City Councilor Dennis J. Carlone said in an interview that he feels a “little frustrated” by the lack of a long-term plan to incorporate two and three-year-olds into the universal preschool program.
“I’m optimistic – but what I said last night is what are the future plans? How do we expand?” he said.
“Through social services, we have an enormous ability to make a real difference for kids who have one parent who has to work or are low-income,” Carlone added. “I want that for more kids. That’s really what it comes down to.”

Jonathan Berkowitz ’23-’24 and Spencer W. Glassman ’23-’24 are setting their campaign promises low — the pair say they are campaigning for Harvard Undergraduate Association co-presidents on a platform of realism.
Summarized by the pithy slogan of “FACT,” the pair want to prioritize financial aid, club funding, and transparency. Berkowitz and Glassman vow to post every HUA financial transaction online and increase the club funding budget.
“We’re trying to be sensible representatives of the students — make everything as easy as possible, as inclusive as possible, and do what we can do and do it well,” said Glassman, a Crimson Editorial editor.
As part of their platform, the duo say they will lobby the Harvard administration to expand financial aid to cover the $200 annual student activities fee. At the same time, the two would make the fee mandatory, increasing club funding by 30 percent, per their projections.
Berkowitz and Glassman said many of their initiatives can be done without cooperation from the Harvard administration, but that they plan on working with administrators when necessary.
“Our platform is not based on antagonizing the administration,” Berkowitz said.
“Like the website to post every single HUA transaction — I could create that in one hour,” Glassman added.
The pair say they first met at a Visitas brunch event in 2019.
“A while back,” Berkowitz remarked.
“Oh my goodness,” Glassman added.
Glassman, a junior from New Jersey concentrating in history, had a brief stint on the Undergraduate Council before it was dissolved in March 2022. He said he was frustrated by the bureaucracy he saw on the Undergraduate Council.
While Glassman supported the dissolution of the UC at the time, he did not run for HUA election the following year, citing the stress of the dissolution campaign.
“That was a very stressful period,” Glassman said. “A lot of people were really mean during that.”
Glassman also serves on the General Education Committee and is the treasurer of The Harvard Orthodox Minyan, an Orthodox synagogue at Harvard Hillel.
Berkowitz, a junior from New York concentrating in philosophy, has never served in Harvard student government.
“I pride myself on having no prior experience in Harvard elections,” he said.
Berkowitz, who recently joined the Harvard Philosophy Review, said the HUA presidency doesn’t require specialized skills, saying “there’s not so much that goes into being HUA president.”
“I don’t think it’s like HUA president has to be this crazy role that requires so much executive skills, or skills that aren’t just going to be present in your given Harvard students,” he said.
Both expressed concern over what they consider an inefficient and self-serving student government.
“We’re not people who are coming in from being UC insiders, HUA insiders, IOP insiders — there is clearly another goal, which is more sort of self-promotion as opposed to just strictly wanting to do what the students want,” Berkowitz said.
Glassman said that neither he nor Berkowitz are aspiring politicians.
The pair said they see the HUA presidency as an organizational role, adding that they would support changing the position’s name to coordinator if students supported the idea.
“We see ourselves as people who are coordinating what this organization has access to — namely the student activities fee money,” Glassman said.
The pair said they think they have created a platform of achievable goals. Berkowitz said they initially planned to campaign on bringing back shopping week, but the duo ultimately decided it wasn’t realistically possible.
“We’re trying not to make promises that we can’t keep,” he said.

John S. Cooke ’25 and Shikoh M. Hirabayashi ’24 — the only two Harvard Undergraduate Association presidential candidates to currently hold positions on the HUA — plan to “make Harvard home.”
The pair, who first met during a club tennis game, are not the most likely match. Cooke, a first generation student from Las Vegas, Nevada, is studying government; Hirabayashi, an international student from Tokyo, is pursuing a double concentration in neuroscience and physics.
The main pillars of their campaign center on mental health, social life, and academic life. Cooke and Hirabayashi say their first priority is to address mental health on campus, and they plan to shorten Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services’ wait time to 10 days or under.
“CAMHS under 10 days will be one of the first major initiatives that we take on just because the need is definitely there,” Cooke said. “We want to have CAMHS as a source so that people can reliably go to in order to get the mental health support they need, and right now it’s not filling that need.”
Cooke and Hirabayashi are also concerned about academic equity for athletes and students who observe religious holidays. They aim to encourage the administration to record more classes and create more flexible section and exam times, especially on Fridays.
“We really want to ensure that everyone can have that sort of academic freedom,” Hirabayashi said.
A major focus under the pair’s student life initiatives is club funding, both in “demystifying” the process and establishing a weekly funding process. Cooke said they hope to have every student group “apply weekly for the events that matter to them.”
Cooke and Hirabayashi have also suggested creating an app and website to allow student organizations to directly apply for funding from the HUA in real time.
In addition to improving clubs on campus, they hope to improve the shuttle system, install nap pods around campus, “de-pest” residential housing, and host forums and HUA co-sponsored parties with clubs.
“So many people have told me that they feel very unsafe walking back to the Quad at night from the river on a weekend or weekday,” Hirabayashi said. “Improving these evening vans and increasing the number as well is definitely a key priority.”
Cooke and Hirabayashi said they feel well equipped to tackle these initiatives, given their experiences as social life officer and academic officer of the HUA, respectively. As current members of the HUA, they said they have worked on events like Concentration Day and a book drive last fall, which raised $11,000 in subsidies for low-income students.
The pair said they are excited by the prospect of continuing their HUA work together in the future as co-presidents.
“We have similar visions for what we want Harvard to be like,” Hirabayashi said. “There’s so much that we can do together, whether that may be standing on stage talking to people or whether that may be working more grassroots — going through files, talking to administrators, or really printing out flyers for our new initiatives.”

Journalist and academic Baba Galleh Jallow will join Harvard Law School as its inaugural Roger D. Fisher fellow this summer, the school announced in a press release last week.
The fellowship, named after HLS professor and Harvard Negotiation Project co-founder Roger D. Fisher ’43, seeks to support individuals in their work to advance the field of negotiation and conflict resolution.
“I’m honored to be the inaugural Fisher fellow, and I’m looking forward to doing just what the fellowship requests, which is to build on the legacy and the work of Roger Fisher and to keep his memory alive,” Jallow said in an interview Wednesday.
During Jallow’s journalistic career, Gambia’s intelligence agency often arrested Jallow for his editorials criticizing military officer Yahya Jammeh’s rule after Jammeh led a coup and seized control of the presidency.
Jallow began his career in journalism writing for the Gambian newspaper the Daily Observer. He later left to start his own newspaper, the Independent, in 1999 after an associate of Jammeh purchased the Daily Observer.
In 2000, the Gambian government declared Jallow to be non-Gambian, and he subsequently left Gambia for the United States, where he continued writing and began teaching.
Jallow said that he continued writing despite government backlash due to his belief that he was “on the side of the truth.”
“When I went out of the country, it offered me even a greater opportunity to write because I was now away from the guns and the boots and the cells, the jail,” Jallow said.
After Jammeh was removed from power, Jallow returned to Gambia, serving as a visiting professor at the University of The Gambia. From 2018 to 2021, he also served as executive secretary of Gambia’s Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparations Committee, a commission tasked with investigating human rights violations that took place during Jammeh’s rule.
For the last three years, Jallow has also been a guest in the Law School’s Transitional Justice Seminar run by HLS instructor Lisa K. Dicker. In the school’s press release, Dicker said that Jallow was “truly incredible” with her students.
“His emphasis is always on how the students should see themselves as agents of change in unjust systems and on the necessity of justice, in all its forms,” she said.
In his one-year appointment as Fisher fellow, Jallow said that he intends to share his experiences and contribute to the fields of transitional justice and African studies.
“I definitely would like to teach a course or co-teach courses on transitional justice in Africa or around the world, because that’s what I’ve been doing all along,” he said.
Jallow said he also wants to work with Harvard’s Center for African Studies, as well as similar programs at neighboring institutions in the Boston area.
In addition to research and teaching, Jallow said that he plans to participate in the Harvard Negotiation Project and hopes to organize a periodic Roger D. Fisher memorial lecture that hosts speakers who are experts in negotiation and conflict resolution.
“I’m looking forward to speaking to my great colleagues at Harvard Law School and learning from them and getting more ideas so we can have a very good group of activities that we can do within the year,” Jallow said.
In the school’s press release, HLS Dean John F. Manning ’82 called Jallow a “leader and pioneer for justice and peace in The Gambia.”
“I know that our community will learn a great deal from the productive discussions and collaborations Dr. Jallow will foster on questions of negotiation and transitional justice,” Manning said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bobby F. Current ’24 and Rohan C. Shah ’24 see themselves as a big tent ticket with the ambition to bring lasting structural change to the young Harvard Undergraduate Association.
Current and Shah — who hail from Olive Branch, Mississippi, and Westchester County, New York, respectively — say their involvement in a variety of student organizations and distance from the HUA make them desirable outsider candidates.
“I think one of the biggest things that sets us apart is the fact that we’re not already entrenched in the HUA and IOP drama,” said Current. “We’re more connected, I think, with the vast majority of Harvard students.”
Current and Shah’s platform is centered around increasing student engagement with the HUA via the introduction of a legislature, not unlike that of the Undergraduate Council — Harvard’s recently dissolved student government structure.
Current, who briefly served as an Eliot House Representative on the UC, said his experience in the Council left him with a better understanding of how to avoid gridlock and improve on the legislature model.
“It showed me where it can go wrong, and that’s always in the back of my mind,” said Current of the UC. “A legislature is good for representation, but we need processes that are streamlined.”
Currently, the student body elects nine officers to the HUA in a popular vote. The officers head teams that oversee different student life issues, like the Academic Team and the Extracurricular Team. All other students serving on these teams are unelected volunteers.
Current and Shah said they believe there is a lack of buy-in to the HUA due to this volunteer-based system.
“I just feel like people are too generally apathetic for a system based on volunteerism to actually be able to do what it needs to do,” Current said.
The move to a legislature would require a significant constitutional rewrite, which can only occur at the beginning of the semester, per the HUA constitution. This restriction means Current and Shah’s legislature model could be implemented at the start of this fall, at the earliest.
“The meat and potatoes of my campaign would have to wait until next semester,” Current said, adding that he is confident there will be sufficient political will for the change.
“I like to think that an appeal to reason would do a lot of it,” Current said. “The HUA has had trouble getting people to show up, and it’s probably not going to get better.”
The duo said they aim to bolster campus mental health resources — specifically citing long wait times for student appointments at Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Service — by any means necessary.
“We’re interested in exploring any creative solution, whether it is from the school administration or the University administration or from sources we haven’t even thought to look at yet,” Shah said.
The pair said their “great synergy” also differentiates them from the other four pairs of candidates.
“I’d love to see any of the other tickets rival the focus and grittiness and energy that we bring to the problems that we’re facing here,” Shah said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crimson fans in Lavietes Pavilion likely couldn’t help but feel a familiar sense of deja vu on Saturday as Harvard men’s basketball (12-12, 3-7 Ivy) once again slipped into an early deficit, this time in a faceoff against Ivy challengers Penn (14-11, 6-4 Ivy).
In a pattern that has been typical of its past three games, the Crimson fell behind early, by as many as 13 points. A reinvigorated second-half-rally cut led to a single three-point possession, but Harvard was unable to complete the comeback and fell behind again late to seal a fourth-consecutive loss.
Penn junior guard Jordan Dingle reflected on the hard-fought win after the game.
“It’s a huge morale booster,” Dingle said. “We haven’t gotten a win on the road in conference since January 2nd at Brown. It shows us that we can be resilient and tough in front of a hostile environment.”
Harvard entered the game with a new starting lineup, including first-year guard Chandler Piggé and first-year forward Chisom Okpara. In what appeared to be a positive start, sophomore guard Evan Nelson put the Crimson on the board early, making a free throw to give Harvard a 1-0 lead.
However, with a minute gone, Penn sophomore forward Nick Spinoso made a layup, recorded a steal on the Crimson’s subsequent possession, and passed to Dingle, who made a deep three-pointer and put the Quakers up 4-1. Penn maintained a winning margin for the rest of the matchup.
Going into the game, Dingle sat second in national NCAA Division 1 men’s basketball rankings for points per game, averaging 24 points across 23 games this season. Dingle looked determined to continue that tear, scoring ten of Penn’s first 14 points and going on to score 25 overall, on 9-for-9 on free throws and 4-8 (50%) shooting from three-point range.
Penn head coach Steve Donahue reflected on Dingle’s performance after the game.
“He’s been doing this all year,” Donahue said. “What I love about him now is he’s rebounding, he's making plays for others, he’s defending at a high level, and obviously he scores in so many different ways.”
With the attention drawn by Dingle, the Crimson had challenges defensively on other parts of the court as well. Spinoso proved especially effective in the post position, using his physicality to score around the rim and providing an effective balance to Dingle’s dynamic play.
Despite its best defensive efforts, the Crimson had a difficult time managing the plethora of scoring threats, finding themselves ten points down at halftime.
Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker reflected on the impact of Spinoso, who went on to score 16 points on 8-for-13 shooting, after the game.
“I thought Spinoso was the biggest difference,” Amaker said. “There’s not many people who are going to be able to stop Dingle – he’s gonna get shots and likely get his points, but can you clamp down on the other guys. Spinoso’s the one I thought [made the difference].”
In the second half, the Crimson attempted to chisel away at the lead. Throughout the game, Harvard shot well, making 25-56 (44.6%) of field goals and recording seven three-pointers. Despite the good shot-making, the Crimson failed to create enough scoring opportunities, turning over the ball frequently without having recorded a decent scoring chance.
With four minutes left in the second half, senior guard Idan Tretout hit a three-pointer to bring the Crimson within six points. A steal on the Quakers’ next possession from senior co-captain Luka Sakota paired with an old-fashioned three-point play from junior co-captain Sam Silverstein prompted joyous celebration and the emergence of a narrow three-point game.
The moment, however, was short-lived, as the Crimson gave up the next eight points to a resilient Quaker offense. Throughout the night, Penn did well to chill any Crimson momentum with well-timed shots, eventually pulling away with an 80-72 victory.
“I think anytime you play in this league, on the road in particular, you gotta do a lot of things well,” said Penn head coach Steve Donahue, “but most importantly you gotta play really hard. I thought the guys played really hard from the start. I thought Harvard competed at a high level as well, just at times we made some shots and they didn’t.”
The loss leaves Harvard in a difficult position in the Ivy League standings. The Crimson sits seventh in the table and would need to win its remaining four games and get lucky with other results to qualify for the Ivy Madness tournament, which is set to be held on March 10-12 at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium.
After narrowly missing the opportunity to compete in a tournament on home court at the end of last season, the disappointment of missing this year’s tournament would be tangible. Despite the circumstances, Coach Amaker remains positive and is focused on the remainder of the season.
“When you find yourself in tough spots, you can either pitch in or pile on and we’ve decided that we want to pitch in,” Amaker said. “Usually you’re going to be on one side of that or the other. I thought we had the right mindset and the spirit and I’m convinced that we’ll have that going forward this coming weekend.”
The Crimson takes on Columbia in New York City on Friday night at 7:00 p.m. before heading upstate to play Cornell on Saturday at 6:00 p.m.

The Harvard women’s and men’s fencing teams traveled to Ithaca, New York this past weekend to compete in the Ivy League Championships. The men’s team was triumphant, leaving the weekend as Ivy League Champions, while the women’s team finished fourth in the contest.
On the first day of competition, the men’s fencing team defeated both Penn and Yale to kick off the stakes-worthy tournament 2-0. An impressive 9-0 showing from the sabre team boosted the Crimson, with senior Filip Dolegiewicz, senior Mitchell Saron, and first-year Matthew Linksy winning all three of their bouts.
Harvard garnered a 20-7 win over Penn in the first match of the day and a 21-6 win over Yale in their second match. In their win against Yale, the sabre, epee, and foil teams all contributed 7-2 victories to give them the edge.
At the end of day 1, Dolegiewicz (sabre), Saron (sabre), Linsky (sabre), sophomore James Chen (foil), senior Kenji Bravo (foil), and junior Jonas Hansen (epee) each had five wins to lead the team.
A previous team record for most wins on the season was also broken on the first day. With 21 wins on the year already, the previous 20-win record set in the 2019-2020 season was surpassed.
Heading into the second day of the weekend, the Crimson placed second with a 2-0 record. Columbia was just ahead with a record of 3-0.
“Going into day two of the competition, Columbia and Harvard were the only two remaining undefeated teams, so we knew that we were on track for a final showdown against Columbia for the Ivy League Championship,” Dolegiewicz explained.
The Crimson were on fire on the second day of the Championships, as all three squads earned victories in their matchup against Princeton.
Once again, the sabre squad stood strong with a 7-2 win. Dolegiewicz and Saron won all three of their bouts. Along with the sabre squad, Chen and first-year Ark Ma (epee) won all three of their bouts.
The next and final match of the day was against Columbia for the Ivy League title.
“The mindset going into that final match was to trust in all of the work we put in throughout the season, take things one bout at a time, and fight with 100 percent intensity,” Dolegiewicz said.
Senior Daniel Solomon and Hansen each won three bouts to help the Crimson overcome Columbia with a final score of 16-11 and win the team Ivy League Championship.This marked a huge win for the Crimson, as Harvard has not won the Ivy League title since 2020, and placed second in 2022.
Not only did the overall team win the Ancient Eight Championship, but Dolegiewicz, the reigning men’s NCAA sabre champion, alongside Chen, were crowned individual champions for sabre and foil, respectively.
“Winning the individual Ivy League Title and the Ivy team championships in my senior year was definitely a major highlight in my career here at Harvard,” Dolegiewicz commented. “It felt like a massive accomplishment and the perfect way to cap off my senior year.”
“Being a senior on the team, it was an incredible feeling to have led the team to an Ivy League title just like the upperclassmen did when we won the title my freshman year.”
First Team All-Ivy honors were awarded to Dolegiewicz, Saron, Chen, Bravo, and Hansen.
With a dominant showing at the Championships, Dolegiewicz is optimistic about the NCAA regional and NCAA championship matches in March, which Harvard will host.
“Looking forward to regionals and the NCAA championships in March, our mindset will stay the same. Our goal for every competition is to dominate the other teams. We know we have the capability to win the NCAA championships, and we will give everything we have.”
As for the women’s team, it found itself tied for second heading into day two of the championships after going a perfect 3-0 on day one.
However, on the second day of the championships, Harvard fell short to Princeton 11-16 in the first match of the day.The Crimson also came up short against Columbia (7-20) and Penn (8-19) to finish off the tournament.
Junior Annora Lee (foil), first-year Zoe Kim (sabre), and sophomore Emily Vermeule (epee) all earned Second Team All-Ivy honors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following three-goal losses in the opening round, the Harvard women's ice hockey team (7-17-3, 6-11-3 ECAC) and the Boston University Terriers (11-17-3, 9-13-3 HEA) returned to Conte Forum to play in the consolation round of the 2023 Beanpot. Even without a Beanpot Championship on the line, both teams desperately wanted a win as they sought to build playoff momentum.
For the Crimson, the match was a tale of two halves. After a hot start, Harvard held a 4-2 lead with 30 minutes remaining. In these final 30 minutes, the Crimson was stuck in neutral, as the Terriersscored five unanswered goals to claim a 7-4 victory and third place at the 2023 Beanpot.
For Harvard head coach Katey Stone, there was no sugarcoating her feelings about her team's effort in staving off the Terriers’ comeback attempt.
"Really disappointed," Stone said. "It doesn't matter which one of these Beanpot games you play in. They all mean a lot."
The Crimson's offensive flurry began just five minutes into the game, thanks to a connection between sophomore defender Mia Biotti and junior forward Shannon Hollands. After saving the puck from drifting out of the offensive zone, Biotti found Hollands streaking across the high slot. Hollands then fired a shot that blew past the goalie and found the top left of the net.
Eight minutes later, Boston University leveled the game at one off of a goal from forward Sydney Healey. While skating away from the goal and trying to avoid the sticks of Harvard defenders, Healey turned on the puck and beat sophomore goalie Daisy Boynton to find the back of the cage.
The first period ended with the Crimson hanging on to a one-goal lead due to its quick work on the power play. With three minutes remaining in the frame, Terriers defender Nadia Mattivi was called for holding, which set up Harvard with a 2-minute one-skater advantage. The Crimson needed just 20 seconds to take the lead, as sophomore forward Gabi Davidson Adams redirected a shot from senior defender Kyra Willoughby for her eighth goal of the season.
Hollands kept the momentum rolling into the second period with an impressive finish on a wild offensive sequence. The sequence started with a breakaway chance for Hollands that was kicked away by Terriers goaltender Callie Shanahan. The follow-up shot by first-year forward Jade Arnone was blocked and deflected back toward Hollands. The second time turned out to be the charm. By pausing before taking the shot, Hollands faked out a defender and froze the goalie before launching a shot just inside the post.
Seconds later, a goal by Julia Nearis cut Harvard's lead back to one. Nearis scored as she was able to calm down a puck that was bouncing toward the goal and guide it past Boynton.
The seesaw once again swung in the Crimson's direction as it increased its lead to two following a team-best 14th goal from senior forward Anne Bloomer. On a two-on-one breakaway chance, Davidson Adams fired a shot that Shanahan saved. Unfortunately for the Terriers, Bloomer was in perfect position for the rebound and scored before Shanahan could recover her position.
After the goal from Bloomer, everything that could go wrong for Harvard did, including committing penalties and turning over the puck.
"There are a lot of places I could probably dive into, but I think at the end of the day, the quality of our play needs to improve dramatically," Stone said.
Boston University struck again in the second on a three-on-three rush. Defender Brooke Disher sent a shot from the top of the faceoff dot that found the top shelf of the net. With one minute left in the second, the Terriers closed the period with a power play goal. Mattivi was credited with the game-tying goal as her shot ricocheted off a Crimson defender into the goal.
Halfway through the third period, Boynton once again had her work cut out for her due to a Harvard defensive error. Following a long outlet pass which a Crimson defender momentarily broke up, a two-on-one rush was set up for Boston University. Christina Vote and Catherine Foulem executed the rush by the book and finished it with a goal as Vote snuck it past Boynton. The goal by Vote turned out to be the game-winner, as the Crimson failed to sustain any offense in the third period. To end the game Clara Yuhn and Vote each scored insurance goals to give the Terriers a 7-4 comeback win.
The seven goals are the second-most surrendered by Harvard this season. The four goals match the most goals scored in a Crimson loss this season.
The 34-save outing by Boynton also served as her first career start, as fellow sophomore goalie Alex Pellicci has thus far gotten the nod over Boynton.
"Young kids need an opportunity to see what they can do," said Stone about the decision to start Boynton.
After clinching a spot in the ECAC playoffs, the last weekend of the regular season may see more experimentation in the lineup. With an outside shot at moving ahead of St. Lawrence (14-17-3, 8-9-3 ECAC) for the seventh seed, the final slate of games will serve as a tune-up for the opening round of the playoffs. Additionally, Harvard's last two games will pit them against Brown (8-18-1, 6-14-0) and Yale (24-2-1, 17-2-1), the current No. 1 seed in the ECAC and the Crimson's most likely playoff opponent.
If Harvard wants to create a Cinderella run in the playoffs, it's now or never.
"We have a gut check for our team right now with regard to the remainder of the season and how hard we are going to play for each other," Stone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard wrestling (3-4 overall, 3-3 Ivy League) made another statement in the Ivy League this past weekend at home defeating Columbia (5-7 overall, 5-3 Ivy League) 19-18 in a gritty match on Friday night. The Crimson followed up with a hefty 21-11 win over visiting Hofstra on Saturday afternoon. These wins moved the Crimson to a 3-4 record on the season and produced a lot of great energy as well. The victory over Columbia came just one year after a decisive 3-27 loss to the Lions, certainly creating a buzz, a testament to both the coaches and wrestlers alike.
Harvard secured victories in five weight classes against Columbia, each proving to be an important decider in the narrow win. Junior Phillip Conigliaro defeated Lennox Wolak at 174 lbs to kick off the match, but things were just heating up. Following Conigliaro, junior Leo Tarantino prevailed at 184 lbs, a match that proved to be vital in the Crimson’s ultimate victory. The Tampa, Fla. native had a huge takedown in the 3rd period to take the match to overtime. In the “4th period,” Tarantino closed out his win with another two-point takedown with just 16 seconds left on the clock, scoring three massive points important to Harvard’s victory.
“It's a game of inches and an overtime win like that ended up being a pretty contributing factor to the score in the end,” said Tarantino in reference to the match. “We've started to do things as a program that we haven't done in years.”
His win brought the Malkin Athletic Center to its feet, a trend that continued throughout the evening.
“I haven't heard the MAC that loud in a long time. It was very cool,” commented head coach Jay Weiss following the exciting dual.
Following a loss at 197 lbs, senior captain Yaraslau Slavikouski and sophomore Diego Sotelo each won their matches at 285 lbs and 125 lbs, respectively. Both wrestlers have had solid seasons thus far, leaving them ranked among the top wrestlers nationally, and look poised to. have an excellent opportunity to make noise in March at the EIWA and NCAA tournaments.
That said, the statement of the evening came from first-year Dante Frinzi. The Pennsylvania native, whose mother and grandmother had surprised him just before the match, certainly made their travels worth it. Just one minute and forty-five seconds into the first period, the 133-pounder pinned Columbia’s Angelo Rini to secure six points. Frinzi’s first win in the MAC also happened to be his first pin in a Harvard singlet. While he admits the transition to collegiate wrestling has not always been easy, Frinzi is excited for what lies ahead.
“I think just competing and adding a bunch of experience throughout this year helped transition into the rest of the season and now, especially at the end of the season,” he reflected. “I think that all of us, we’re really just putting our foot on the pedal and really aiming towards the end of the year.”
On its way to victory, Harvard dropped the final four matches to the Lions, but the early winning momentum carried into Saturday. First-years Joseph Cangro and Jack Crook, junior Josh Kim, and senior Trevor Tarsi, along with Sotelo and Slavikouski, all took home victories in the Crimson’s notable win over Hofstra.
With EIWA Championships quickly approaching, Weiss’ tenure in collegiate wrestling has certainly contributed to the program peaking at just the right time. Although somewhat new to the scene, Frinzi can attest to this impact.
“He's a great coach – one of the best I've ever had. He really shaped every individual to just really come together as a team and focuses on everyone coming together and just lifting each other up. He just really keeps us dialed in.”
Tarantino spoke of similar sentiments of his coach, saying “He has always been character first in recruiting, and you can see how explosive that is when you get a group of people who have faith in each other and have faith in the mission of the program.”
The 184-pounder continued, reflecting, “I think that's something that's really rare –  every single one of them I would invite to my house, introduce them to my family and friends, because those are the people that our coaches surround everyone with –  not just talent, but people first. That call comes from Coach Weiss.”
Harvard will return to the MAC on Friday night to take on Brown in a 7:00 p.m. match against the Bears. This match will be the last before the Crimson takes to the mat in Philadelphia for the EIWA tournament, set to take place during the first weekend in March.

We’ll cut right to the chase: Yes, sampling TJ snacks was in fact our only plan for Valentine’s Day evening, no, none of us had real dates for the good ol’ day of love, and no, we don’t need to keep talking about it.
Your favorite Trader Joe Trio (TJT) is back with another round of snack reviews. While we may have been slightly disappointed by the lack of savory Valentine’s Day items, our raging — and by our, we mean Corinne’s — sweet tooth was more than satisfied by the below treats. A self-inflicted sugar coma on Valentine’s Day may seem dark…but when it comes to Trader Joe’s, there’s nothing but love.
Strawberry Greek Nonfat Yogurt 
We know what you’re thinking — I thought this list would be fun. How in the world is strawberry greek yogurt supposed to comfort my aching heart on the evening of the most emotionally vulnerable night of the year? Well, Ellen agrees — “It’s just strawberry yogurt. There’s nothing more.” Meanwhile, Corinne was hype about both the flavor profile and consistency of this light pink dairy snack. Pro tip: Add some of the freeze dried strawberries (keep reading…) on top.
Strawberry Organic Creamy Cashew Cultured Yogurt Alternative 
It’s Janani’s world and we’re just living in it. Our vegan queen had us back again trying the Trader Joe’s “Organic Creamy Cashew Cultured Yogurt Alternative” — this time, strawberry flavored. While we truly wanted this to work, it just…didn’t. In Ellen’s words, “to call it a yogurt alternative is deeply unjust to yogurt.” Its texture was definitely lacking. Don’t believe us? Janani drank its remaining contents in a total of 11 seconds and it “went down like juice.” Somehow, some way, Corinne said she liked it…is this her red flag?
Rabitos Royale Ruby Cacao Figs 
Are you sick of gifting the same ol’ Hershey's milk chocolate bar? Looking to spice up your sweets game and impress your fellow Harvard students, possibly even a lOwElL rEsiDeNt with a my-house-is-the-best superiority complex? Look no further. With the “Rabitos Royale Ruby Cacao Figs” (I am out of breath after typing that), your significant other or most definitely just a platonic friend may very well be floored by this concoction. The fig’s chocolate truffle filling combined with the white chocolate exterior makes for a whole load of sophisticated flavor. Ellen dubbed this as “an all natural milky way.” But beware…this one is super sweet.
Gone Berry Crazy! Dark Chocolate Covered Strawberry Pieces 
These chocolate-covered nuggets of frozen strawberry goodness somehow ascended HUDS’ Fruit Forward attempt at frozen strawberry-flavored rocks and chipped chocolate. We already knew these were good and are berry into them. Probably necessary to warn against the possibility of intense freezer burn — because that would be far worse than getting dumped the day before Valentine’s Day, right? Right!??!?!?!
Cinnamon Bun Inspired Joe Joe’s 
Does it count as officially V-Day-themed if it spoke to our hearts? It was a seasonal new item, okay? We think that counts. This Oreo-inspired snack was a blast from the past. Consensus: it delivered in all aspects. Flavor? A little sweet, but check. Orgasmic feeling? Now that’s what I call Trader Ho. Nostalgia? Dunkaroos, and Dunkaroos alone. These are necessary — trust us. Bonus points for being vegan friendly!
Freeze Dried Strawberries
“I kinda destroyed the freeze dried strawberries.” —Janani
She did. In fact, Janani is willing to bet she would win the ultimate showdown: Janani vs. Dining Hall Mouse race to finish a bag of TJ’s freeze dried strawberries. Regardless, the emptied-out bag is just evidence that freeze dried strawberries are both a delicious (and healthy!!) snack during any season.
Chocolate Mousse Cake
Maybe don’t get this if you aren’t a fan of mousse. Or cake. *Cough* Ellen. But for all chocolate, mousse, and cake lovers out there, this heart-shaped cake will win over your heart. Not only is it incredibly cute and a good price, but it is dense, fudgy, and will make you forget that you don’t have a date have you wishing for next year’s Valentine’s season already!
Not pictured: red ravioli (the one and only savory themed-item!!), heart shaped macarons, raspberry hearts, XOXO candy, and heart-shaped jelly beans which were, much to our deep sadness, all not present at our local Trader Joe’s. Valentine’s Day might be over, but some of these items are very much still in stock on the shelves at our lovely Allston Trader Joe’s. So go forth, sugar-loving friends, and eat your hearts (haha haha get it? hearts for Valentine’s Day) out!
