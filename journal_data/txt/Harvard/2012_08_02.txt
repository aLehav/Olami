After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the aid of pharmaceutical companies and multiple federal agencies, researchers at the Wyss Institute have undertaken projects that could revolutionize the drug testing process.
For the past half-decade, scientists at the institute have worked to produce a series of chips about the size of a computer memory stick that contain a replication of the mechanical and biochemical behaviors of various human organs, from the gut to the heart.
The Institute, which was created by Harvard to increase collaboration between academic fields and to progress biomedical research, reached a breakthrough two years ago when it created a mock-human lung that made a breathing motion and fought bacteria like the real thing.
Because the devices are minimal and translucent, researchers can study the actions of human organs in real time.
Now, the group is attempting to link up the various replicas to create a more complete model.
“It’s a high risk project,” Wyss Institute Founding Director Don E. Ingber said. “I’m pretty sure we can do two organs at a time. Whether we can do ten remains to be seen, but we’ve been amazed at what we have been able to accomplish in a short time.”
Ingber said that the group hopes to have linked the heart and lung models within the next few months, but that there are several barriers to success, ranging from making sure the blood substitutes match up to developing new microanalytical technology to keep tabs on the model and keep it ‘alive.’
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is aiding researchers in tackling the many challenges ahead by offering up to 37 million dollars for the project.
If Ingber’s project succeeds, the institute will have created an alternative to traditional animal testing for drug companies looking to test their products before attempting human trials.
Ingber said that his method would be cheaper, faster, and more ethically sound than the current option of using rats, monkeys, or other animals.
“The real problem with animal testing, one is ethical, but the other is that more often than not results in animals don’t predict results in humans,” Ingber said. “We don’t have any other option now and it does work sometimes, but the goal would be bit by bit to replace one animal at a time. We are in discussion with the FDA about what we need to do to begin to do that.”
Similar research on synthetic human models is being done all over the country but Ingber said Harvard still has a “significant lead” thanks to an illustrious history in the field and a wealth of resources in a number of relevant fields at Harvard.
“Harvard is in a good position to compete and dominate in this field,” said Kevin K. Parker, who researches cardiac cell biology and tissue engineering at the Wyss Institute. “A lot of [other researchers] are using similar techniques to ours, which indicates Harvard is kind of the path-setter in this area.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One day after Malcolm Howard ’05 (CAN) became the most decorated male rower in Harvard Olympic history with a silver medal in the men’s eight, Esther Lofgren ’09 and Caryn Davies ’05 joined him on the podium, winning gold with the women’s eight for Team USA.
The convincing wire-to-wire victory capped off an undefeated four years since the USA boat, of which Davies was a member, won gold in Beijing. Expecting a challenge from Canada, among other boats, the US boat did what they’ve done on so many occasions before—smoked the competition.
For Lofgren, gold marks a dream fulfilled. After her mother barely missed out on the 1984 Olympics and she was one of the last cuts for that gold medal winning boat in Beijing, Lofgren spent the last four years with this moment on her mind.
Gold for Davies makes her the most decorated Harvard Olympian in any sport. With back-to-back gold medals to go with silver in Athens, Davies is also the most successful female rower in Olympic history.
Earlier in the morning Henrik Rummel ’09 and the USA four continued their hot streak, winning their semifinal and advancing to the A final on Saturday. After starting out slowly they climbed back, proving too much for their opponents and winning by nearly a boat length. Rummel’s boat had never raced together before these Olympic Games, but Rummel maintained throughout training that they were a fast boat which was sure to surprise their opponents.
After winning their first heat by a sizable margin, Rummel remarked that it was “surprisingly easy,” but was cautious not to count his eggs before they’ve hatched. With another convincing victory the semifinal, they won’t be surprising anyone as they take on medal favorites Great Britain and Australia.
Will Newell ’11 closed off his Olympics with a second place finish in the men’s lightweight four. Understandably disappointed by his boat’s placement in the B Final, Newell vowed to focus on rowing the best race they could. Now that his rowing Olympics are over, he—and the other athletes whose competitions have finished—can truly enjoy the Olympic atmosphere.
Tomorrow morning, make sure to watch Brodie Buckland ’06 row for gold for Australia in the A final of the men’s pair. Then, in the afternoon, Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Great Britain take on France in a women’s basketball group stage matchup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday night, over 37,000 ladies and gentlemen rose and removed their cap at Fenway Park. Then, they got sad news over the intercom.
“Earlier this morning, Harvard head baseball coach Joe Walsh passed away suddenly,” the PA announcer said. “We now ask that you join us in a moment of silence, as we remember Joe Walsh.”
The bright lights on the outfield scoreboard went black and the capacity crowd at the Cathedral of Baseball went silent in honor of a local son.
“Coach Walsh is from the Greater Boston area, he grew up here, coached here, he threw batting practice at Fenway,” said Marty Ray, manager of special projects for the Boston Red Sox. “We thought it was an appropriate gesture to observe his passing.”
When Ray was alerted to Walsh’s death by Ray’s close friend, Kurt Svoboda, Harvard’s assistant athletic director, he “immediately” decided to pay tribute to Walsh before the night’s home game.
Ray said that the Red Sox generally reserve the memorial service for cases in which the Red Sox community and greater New England community are “especially impacted.”
“He touched a lot of us here at the Red Sox,” Ray said.
Even though Ray did not have much interaction with the Harvard coach, he still had respect for the kind of man Walsh was. Ray recalled a moment during Harvard’s trip to Fenway this April to commemorate the stadium’s 100th anniversary when Walsh noticed a boy on the field who was suffering from cancer.
“He smiled as soon as he saw that child,” Ray said. “That showed that even during…performing his role as coach he still had a soft spot for kids, especially kids who were sick. It showed he was a great man.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether it’s your first, second, or third time, the feeling is always the same.
That was what Esther Lofgren ’07-’09, Malcolm Howard ’05, and Caryn Davies ’04-’05 found out this week when the trio of former Harvard rowers won medals at the London Olympics.
Early Thursday morning, Davies and Lofgren won gold in the women’s eight, a victory that came almost exactly 24 hours after Howard captained his Canadian team to the silver in the men’s version of the same event.
With its victory, the heavily-favored American boat anchored by Davies and Lofgren—the fourth-ever USA Olympic boat to feature two former Radcliffe rowers—defended its 2008 Olympic title and maintained an undefeated streak that has spanned the last half-decade. It was the first Olympic medal for Lofgren and the third overall for Davies, who was part of the teams that won gold in Beijing and got silver in the same event at the 2004 Games in Athens.
Though Davies—now the most decorated rower in Harvard history—had been there before, the top of an Olympic podium was a position Lofgren has been working towards for quite some time. After taking time away from Harvard in 2007 to try-out for the Beijing games, Lofgren fell just short of making the squad. It was a fate her mother had also experienced in 1984, when as a rower she likewise barely missed out on making the Olympic team. So Lofgren returned to school more motivated than ever to make it to London and realize a dream she and her mother shared.
“The last four years have been a fight to be the best rower I can be, to push myself past what others and what I thought my limits were, to, if nothing else, make sure that I had used each day as best I could to never feel that feeling [of being cut] again,” she wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed this week.
And after achieving that goal and getting to the Olympics at long last, the rower—who since graduating has taken jobs as a tutor, barista, sandwich-maker, and babysitter to get by financially while training—made the most of her opportunity.
On Thursday, she, Davies—currently a student at Columbia Law School—and their seven boatmates raced to victory with a time of 6:10.59, besting the silver-medalist Canada squad by two seconds.
“It’s the best feeling in the world,” Lofgren said in the post-race press conference. “We just went, we were going with everybody in the boat and we were having the best race of our lives.”
Howard was similarly euphoric after captaining his eight to the silver on Wednesday, an achievement that gave him a second career medal to go with the gold one he earned as part of the Canadian squad that won the same event in 2008.
“This is an unbelievable feeling,” the Harvard alum told the Vancouver Sun after the race. “I told [my team] how proud I was of them.”
But the week initially didn’t go as smoothly for Howard’s squad as it did for that of Lofgren and Davies, which cruised to victory in its heat on Sunday before advancing to Thursday’s Class A final.
The Canadians, on the other hand, placed fifth in the opening round, as the boat’s inexperience—it featured six first-time Olympians—almost caused it to miss out on the final altogether. But with everything on the line, the crew came together, thanks in large part to Howard’s leadership.
“There were nerves but Malcolm did a great job of keeping us calm and confident,” Andrew Byrnes, one of only two other returnees from the 2008 gold medalists, told the Sun.
The Canadians could not duplicate their victory in 2012, falling to a heavily-favored German squad that had not lost a race in four years. But for Howard—whose boat’s time of 5:49.98 in the 2,000 meters placed it just-behind Germany’s 5:48.75—the results of the London Games were just as meaningful.
“[London and Beijing] were two different stories,” Howard said. “We had a plan and mission in 2008 but here at London was different because we had so many younger guys.”
“Maybe that’s why this feels so hugely emotional and is such a high,” he added. “We put our teeth right into the middle of this race.”

Larry Thomas, Seinfeld's (in)famous Soup Nazi, will be coming to Harvard Square on Friday, manning a food truck with a Seinfeld-based menu on a national tour.
The truck will be in Winthrop Park on JFK Street and will remain in Harvard Square from noon until 2 p.m. before moving to Dewey Square in Boston. Seinfeld diehards and newbies alike will be delighted by the menu offerings, which include Mulligatawny Soup (from the famous “Soup Nazi” Episode) and Junior Mints and Muffin Tops, other selections that remain a part of Seinfeld lore.
According to the truck’s Facebook page, Thomas will “sign autographs, shake your hand and if you’re lucky he might even yell at you.”
There is no indication yet as to whether or not his recipe-filled armoire will make an appearance.
