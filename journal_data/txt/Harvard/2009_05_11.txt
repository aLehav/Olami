After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its final meeting of the semester, the Undergraduate Council voted last night to pass the UC Reform Act, which alters its constitution to increase the body’s size from 35 to 51 representatives. The vote—26-6-2—comes on the heels of a semester’s worth of discussion and debate sparked by a set of recommendations issued by the Dowling Committee, which was charged last spring with reviewing student governance and issued a report this March proposing reforms.This legislation, which adopts some of the Dowling Committee’s suggestions with respect to UC internal structure, raises the number of Council representatives per district—Houses for upperclassmen and clusters of dormitories for freshmen—from two to three. “The Council will be doing more because we’ll have a third rep per district,” said UC Parliamentarian Eric N. Hysen ’11, a main proponent of the Act.The Act also increases the number of standing committees within the Council from two—the Finance Committee and the Student Affairs Committee—to five. The Finance Committee will still exist, but some responsibilities will be delegated to other committees. The Student Affairs Committee will be split into the Student Life Committee and the Education Committee. The Student Relations Committee—which was created as an ad hoc committee in the first piece of legislation this semester—will also be institutionalized. A Student Initiatives Committee will also be formed to run programs such as UC TKTS, which raffles off free tickets every week to campus and local events.“The most significant change is that we’re making it the business of the Council to work with student-run programs that will help student life,” said Hysen, who is also on The Crimson’s IT board, in reference to the stated responsibilities of the new Student Initiatives Committee.These changes will take effect when the Council meets again next semester. Former UC Vice President Randall S. Sarafa ’09, who was a member of the Dowling Committee, voted against the legislation, saying it “pre-empted any reform at the College and University level.” “It’s unfortunate to see this reform being passed because it creates undue bureaucracy within the UC,” Sarafa said. “It will make the UC more inefficient and more opaque to student interests and student needs.”For the first 30 minutes of the meeting, the UC listened to a presentation about the University’s endowment from President Drew G. Faust, who was unable to attend last week’s town hall with Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. Later in the meeting, the Council voted to allocate $3,000 of the surplus money in its Operations Fund to house student staffers for the UC’s recently-announced capital campaign, which aims to raise funds to purchase a student community center.  At present, talks on this front have focused on the multimillion dollar 45 Mt. Auburn St. property that currently houses the Democracy Center.According to Senan Ebrahim ’12, the UC hired four students—Abel Acuna ’11, Dana M. Kase ’11, Christopher G. Kleinhen ’10, and Winnie J. Liu ’11—out of about 30 applicants to staff its capital campaign over the summer. —Staff writer Brittany M. Llewellyn can be reached at bllewell@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Eric P.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will not restrict international travel—including trips to Mexico—in response to the Swine Flu epidemic, University leaders decided last week.“This is a contingent decision, that is, it can change depending on information about events yet to occur,” wrote Vice Provost for International Affairs Jorge I. Dominguez in an e-mailed statement. “But, given the near end of the academic year, it seemed sensible to reach this decision explicitly.”In the past week, several other colleges and universities, including Yale, have announced in cancellations for Mexico-bound trips due to concerns about swine flu.Office of International Programs Director Catherine H. Winnie said that any updates on University-related travel restrictions will be announced on Harvard’s home page, and students funded by individual centers, such as the OIP and the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, will be contacted directly by those organizations regarding any changes.Winnie said that there is one Harvard-sponsored internship program in Mexico run by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. In addition, there are half a dozen undergraduates researching or traveling in the country on Harvard grants.Students may still opt out of attending university-sponsored travels to Mexico if they are personally concerned about the outbreak.“We understand that one’s health is a very personal thing. If a student decides not to go to Mexico, we will sit down with him or her and figure things out on a case by case basis,” said Christopher “Kit” H. Barron, a spokesman for the David Rockefeller Center.Barron said he could not say for certain whether the student would be allowed to keep his or her summer grant.According to Winnie, the OIP would help students secure an alternative placement and allow their grants to fund the new program or project in the event that a cancellation did occur.Harvard’s inaugural Summer Internship Program on Sustainable Development in Mexico has placed eight undergraduates in various rural communities in the southern part of the country.Barron said that as of last Thursday, all eight students still plan to attend the program.“We want to stress that not only has the University been monitoring the situation, but on an individual level we at the David Rockefeller Center have had the chance to talk with everyone about safety procedures,” Barron said. “We’ve met with every single student traveling to Mexico about H1N1, and we’re reaching out to students and parents to make sure that they have all the information that we have.”“Now more than ever, everyone traveling internationally should be registered with International SOS so Harvard can provide assistance, should it be needed,” Dominguez wrote, referring to a 24-hour emergency medical service provided by the University to all undergraduates traveling abroad for Harvard-related activities, such as study-abroad programs.—Staff Writer Manning Ding can be reached at ding3@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard recruited two high-profile professors from other universities: Mark Kisin will join the Mathematics Department and Jerry X. Mitrovica will join the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences next year.
Though the Faculty of Arts and Sciences extended the offers before the market crash, the faculty salary freeze may have hindered Harvard’s attempts to woo Kisin, a prominent number theorist.
Harvard’s math department ran into difficulty drawing Kisin away from the University of Chicago after U. Chicago presented him with a more appealing counter-offer, according to math department chair Shing-Tung Yau.
Because of the salary freeze that FAS Dean Michael D. Smith imposed on the Faculty last December, Harvard was unable to raise Kisin’s starting salary to make the offer more attractive, Yau said.
“If [salaries are] frozen forever, then we’re not competitive,” Yau said. 
Although Kisin—who will assume his new position as professor of mathematics on July 1—was informed of the offer last May and was formally extended a package last August, he did not accept the offer until about a month ago, according to Yau.
Harvard was able to win Kisin over after making accommodations for three University of Chicago Ph.D. students that he is supervising. The graduate students will become exchange scholars at Harvard for the remainder of their Ph.D. programs. 
Kisin said he is excited to be coming to Harvard because Harvard’s math department has a strong tradition in number theory dating back to the 1960’s. But he added that he will miss the University of Chicago.
“[U. Chicago is] maybe a little less formal, and you probably have more freedom here,” he said. “I think Harvard is the only place I would consider leaving it for.”
Jeremy Bloxham, the divisional dean for the sciences, said that Kisin is “widely acknowledged as one of the top number theorists of the next generation,” adding that he stands out not only for the quality of his research, but also his teaching and mentorship.
Mitrovica will leave the University of Toronto to join Harvard’s Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences as a geophysics professor.
According to Bloxham, Mitrovica is well known for discovering the method for “fingerprinting sea level changes”—that is, pinpointing the locations of melted ice caps from the subsequent effects on the gravity field.
Kisin's search started three years ago, while Mitrovica's started two years ago, according to Bloxham, and the offers were made before the financial crisis hit.
Although Bloxham said that he is excited to see Kisin and Mitrovica join the Faculty, he foresees senior faculty appointments of this kind to be unusual in the years to come.
“I think there will still be the occasional senior search where there’s a targeted opportunity which we really find irresistible, but we really have to put the emphasis on hiring at the junior level,” he said in a phone interview yesterday. “If we didn’t hire junior faculty for certain years, then we would end up all senior, and obviously that’s not a place we want to be.”
Smith announced a recent Undergraduate Council meeting that FAS will have 19 junior faculty searches next year—but none at the senior level.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From https://planning.fas.harvard.edu/
Architectural and Engineering Design Services
In the past when faculty requested new projects, the FAS would often engage outside professionals to design preliminary planning and engineering documents. Often, this occurred as part of feasibility studies and prior to any formal project approval. Going forward, outside professional services will only be engaged after written authorization to proceed with a project has been secured. There are two rationales behind this new approach. First, the FAS will now only spend its resources on designs that will be implemented. Second, this signals a shift to instead drawing on the University’s significant internal design competencies. These bright and creative minds will be called upon to assist with the design and planning of future capital projects.
Athletics

Just as we teach in the classroom, many of our lessons are taught on the athletic fields and courts, where nearly 2,000 of our student athletes compete. Recognizing the need to support the primary research and teaching missions, the Athletics Department is implementing cost-saving changes that will be noticeable to the entire Harvard community. These include the closing of the Malkin Athletic Center this summer from June 8 to Aug. 27; transitioning of the men’s junior varsity teams in hockey, basketball, and baseball to club status; and reduced travel team budgets for non-local and non-Ivy competitions.
Capital Budget
In light of the dramatically altered financial landscape, FAS has scaled back its capital ambitions to match the new economic reality. Relative to the capital aspirations from one year ago, FAS has reduced the capital plan for the next two years by more than 50 percent. Only projects that are cash-funded or critical to the maintenance of the FAS’s primary mission – such as essential life-safety upgrades and expenditures associated with faculty recruitment – will be funded in the near term. That said, FAS will continue to reinvest in its nearly 10 million square feet of academic, research, and housing space in order to maintain the facilities in good working order. It should be noted that sustainable design also remains a high priority.
Core Facilities and Shared EquipmentHarvard has historically provided subsidies for research cores and service centers. While subsidies will still be provided, they will not be offered at the same high level as has historically been the practice.
Dining Services
Beginning in September, on weekdays House dining halls will serve a lighter breakfast meal that still provides ample variety and healthful choices. The menu will consist of:
    * Proteins and cheeses, including hard-boiled eggs, ham, cheese, and cottage cheese
    * Hand and sliced fruits
    * Hot cereal (oatmeal) and condiments, and a variety of cold cereals
    * Muffins, bagels, breads, and toaster waffles, and condiments such as butter, cream cheese, peanut butter, and jelly
    * Yogurt
    * Coffee, hot tea, hot chocolate, juices, sodas, milk, and water
Heartier items such as hot eggs, breakfast meats, and griddle selections will continue to be available weekdays at Annenberg Hall. Houses will still serve a full Saturday breakfast and Sunday brunch.
Meanwhile, Harvard University Dining Services will enhance its Brain Break budget by 40 percent, meeting a more significant demand from students for late-night food and service. Brain Break offerings will include:
    * The current selection of beverages, pastries, condiments, and dessert
    * New Brain Break offerings including hand fruit, cold cereals, juices, and rotating specials such as veggies and dip, a cheese board, chips and pretzels, chips and salsa, and make-your-own cupcakes
Endowment Resources
We rely heavily on the endowment to fund our teaching and research mission. We have identified a number of endowment funds that are not being utilized. We have analyzed the terms of these endowments to identify areas where the endowment income can be used, in line with the donors’ intent, to make a positive impact within the FAS or for interdisciplinary priorities of the FAS across the University. These changes will serve to protect our academic programs from unnecessary reductions.
Energy Savings
In support of the University’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, FAS continues to pursue a variety of money-saving energy conservation strategies: temperature set-point changes, motion-sensing light switches, light bulb change-outs, and solar panel installations, among others. By lowering the winter heating set-point to 68° and raising the summer cooling set-point to 75°, the FAS will reduce its multimillion-dollar heating and cooling budget by an estimated 3 percent annually. This change has the added benefit of reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 1,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCDE) annually. FAS will continue to pursue such energy conservation strategies. As part of this process, an audit of all FAS facilities is underway, with the goal of simultaneously reducing our energy expenditures and shrinking our carbon footprint.
Exam Proctors
Historically, Harvard has hired proctors for undergraduate exams. Beginning this fall, existing faculty, graduate students, and staff will proctor exams, eliminating the need to hire additional temporary staff.

Flexible and Part-Time Staff Work Schedules
In areas that experience strong seasonality in demand – such as offices serving students – new, reduced-schedule employment options are being explored and implemented. This change will better align staff hours with seasonal demands of support for students and faculty. Additionally, it will provide a more flexible work schedule, a request often voiced by employees who struggle with childcare issues in the summer months and school holiday periods.
Fundraising and Development
Since the bequest of John Harvard in 1636, the FAS has been continually renewed by gifts from alumni and friends. In light of the current needs of the FAS, the Development Office has redoubled its energies in raising current-use unrestricted and financial aid funds for the Dean without adversely impacting gifts to the endowment. This will be reflected in Harvard College Fund messaging and overall fundraising approaches, and will require that the FAS speak with “one voice” about the importance of flexible gifts to the Dean. The FAS Development Office asks that all fundraising discussions with individuals, either alumni or non-alumni, be vetted and coordinated with the Development Office to ensure compliance with University Gift Policy and to ensure that alumni and other individuals do not receive conflicting requests or messages from multiple units at Harvard.
Graduate (PhD) Student Class Size
Academic departments and committees will see a smaller entering class of PhD students in September 2009. The majority of graduate programs have seen a reduction in the size of their graduate class. At the same time, it should be noted that the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will provide a modest increase in the PhD stipend for both continuing students as well as those entering in September. This tradeoff was made in support of FAS’s long-term commitment to the academic and professional growth of the existing cadre of graduate students, now nearly 3,500 strong. There will also be modest reductions in expenses related to programs such as orientation and opening day activities, Dudley House events, and commencement.

Harvard College Admissions Office
The Harvard College Admissions Office is shifting the emphasis of its outreach activities from travel-based interactions to ones relying on better and more frequent use of modern communications technologies. This shift will not change the geographic coverage of admissions outreach. However, some of the local outreach around the country and world will be achieved through an even closer collaboration between the Cambridge-based College admissions team and the Harvard Clubs and alumni already distributed around the world.
HUSEC
The FAS (including the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) contributes $13.5 million annually to the Harvard University Science and Engineering Committee (HUSEC) to support intra-faculty science initiatives, part of a $53 million university-wide funding level. Historically, HUSEC has allocated funds from the $53 million on a competitive basis as requests come in.  HUSEC will work without a predetermined funding allocation. Rather, it will review funding requests, approving only those that are deemed critical to advancing the scientific priorities of the University.
Journal Subscriptions
The Harvard College Library will no longer acquire print copies of a large number of journals where online subscriptions are available. This measure will allow HCL to redirect funds to other parts of the collections.
Leasing of Non-Harvard Buildings
As much as possible, and as leases expire, FAS will consolidate academic support space into Harvard-owned space. A review of all of FAS’s off-campus leases is currently underway, and further reductions in spending in this area are expected. While moves such as this will mean tighter quarters for some support staff, this step is necessary to free up resources to support core mission areas.Lost Book Replacement Fee
To cover the administrative costs associated with replacing lost library books, the Harvard College Library is instituting a non-refundable billing fee in addition to the replacement cost already charged when a book is lost.
Office of Career Services
The Office of Career Services (OCS) will operate on a reduced basis for Harvard College students and alumni from July 6 to 31, 2009. A reduced staff will perform essential administrative functions in the areas of budget, employer relations, monitoring of students overseas, and web maintenance. Students and alumni of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Division of Continuing Education will continue to be served throughout July. OCS will reopen for regular business on Aug. 3, 2009.

Penthouse Coffee Bar at SOCH
Staffed food service at the SOCH’s Penthouse coffee bar will be discontinued for next academic year due to minimal use by students. The Penthouse self-service espresso machine will remain available if demand is sufficient, as well as snack and drink vending machines. The coffee bar space will be available for event programming, informal student use, or reservations for private events by student organizations.

Posting of Staff Positions
The FAS is placing requests for new and replacement staff under greater scrutiny than ever before. Requests for replacement and new staff positions, as well as reclassification requests, must be justified from both mission and business perspectives. In light of the continuing economic challenge, this is the most prudent path toward conserving our precious resources and preserving employment for our existing staff base to support our mission and pursue our academic priorities.
Publications
We have moved over time to access increasing amounts of academic information online. It therefore makes sense from both a financial and a sustainability perspective to move many of our paper publications – such as the Courses of Instruction, student handbooks, and Q Guide – online. This will allow us to update the information on a real-time basis throughout the academic year. Moving publications online is part of a broader strategy to enhance and optimize our web presence.
Quad Library
To maintain support for library programs that are more heavily used by students, the Harvard College Library will discontinue library services in the Quad Library at the end of spring term. However, HCL librarians will continue to offer research support in the Hilles building for students, conducting sessions on topics such as how to use RefWorks, finding multimedia resources in the libraries, and creating research strategies for a paper. The College will engage students over the coming months in discussions on how best to use the nearly 10,000 square feet made available by this move to meet student activities and social space needs.

Salaries and Bonuses
In fiscal year 2010 (July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010), faculty and non-union staff salaries will remain flat at fiscal year 2009 levels and no bonuses will accrue for any employee class for fiscal year 2010.
Scan and Deliver Service
A new service, Scan and Deliver, will be formally launched in the fall, making over 10 million Harvard library items available electronically to users. Materials can be requested directly from the HOLLIS record, and they will be scanned and delivered to the user’s email account free of charge. A beta version was released in April.
Shuttle Service
The College will make a number of changes to its shuttle schedule for the 2009-2010 academic year. Once approved, detailed shuttle information and schedules can be found at http://www.uos.harvard.edu/transportation/passenger_transport_services/.  Harvard College is working with Passenger Transport Services to maintain shuttle service during peak hours of ridership, including morning and late afternoon periods. In addition, we have ensured the continuation of Shuttle Tracker, the real-time GPS tracking system which allows students to wait indoors until a shuttle is nearing a stop, helping them plan their schedules more efficiently. However, preliminary service reductions during the academic year will be instituted including the following:
    * Elimination of service on the following University holidays: Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Martin Luther King Day, Presidents Day
    * Moving shuttle service start times on Saturdays and Sundays to 12:15 p.m.    * Reducing weekday shuttle frequency from the Quad and Memorial Hall to 20 minute departures (instead of the current 10-minute departures) between 12 noon and 2 p.m.
    * Extended overnight service will only operate on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. However, Sunday through Wednesday nighttime shuttle service will extend its operation from 12:30 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.
    * Shuttle service to the Longwood area remains unchanged.
In addition, Harvard College is working with Passenger Transport Services to maintain daytime and evening van services during peak ridership hours; however, service reductions will likely take place to this service as well.  We will update these changes on the Transportation Services web site once they are finalized. In addition to the evening van service, students will continue to have the option of calling the Harvard University Campus Escort Program (HUCEP) at 617-384-8237 from 10:30 p.m. to 2 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday nights, and 10:30 p.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Saturday nights.
Telecommunications Management
The FAS has more than 6,000 landline phones with a wide variety of telephone service features. Most of these are digital phone lines, also known as ISDN, which cost roughly twice as much per month as analog lines. Many faculty and staff do not need the additional features – such as call forwarding and conferencing capabilities – available in a digital phone, and due to advances in analog phone technology, many other digital phone features are now available for analog phone lines. An ongoing audit of our usage and needs has so far yielded substantial annual savings through “downshifting” of digital lines to analog lines, conversion of physical fax machines to virtual fax services that deliver faxes directly to an employee’s email account, and shifting of some employees to use only cell phones. The FAS is also auditing use of FAS-issued mobile phones and PDAs.
TF/TA Allocations
Teaching fellow and teaching assistant allocations will be under close scrutiny, guided by our commitments to undergraduate education and to financial support for graduate students. All TF and TA appointments will be reviewed by the Office of Undergraduate Education to ensure compliance with new and existing guidelines on section sizes and appropriate levels of compensation. In some cases, existing practices that deviate from the standard guidelines must be modified.

Travel, Meals, and Entertainment
The FAS spent about $13 million last year on travel, meals (including catering), and entertainment. Based on department plans for fiscal year 2010, we will spend far less next year. As announced in January, the former meeting subsidy at the Faculty Club has been eliminated. Non-sponsored and non-research related travel should be used in only the most important circumstances and only in cases where technology solutions, such as videoconferencing, are inadequate or unavailable.
Upgrades and Discretionary Facility Enhancements
In the near term, FAS will cease nearly all discretionary facility upgrades and enhancements, such as touch-up painting, painting simply to change the color of a space, and carpet replacements in cases where the existing carpet is still serviceable.
Use of ConsultantsHistorically at Harvard, when school expertise in a particular area either does not exist or is not available within reasonable time constraints, outside consultants have been used to fill the gap. Last year, the FAS spent nearly $10 million on external consultants. Instead FAS will utilize the expertise available within the University to accomplish such tasks. This will require a commitment to the “One Harvard” perspective, and will necessitate greater communication and collaboration across schools. Only in rare cases when required expertise simply does not exist within the University will outside consultants be used.
Voluntary Early Retirement Plan
This incentive was offered to 521 FAS employees in February, with approximately 30 percent of eligible staff opting for voluntary enhanced retirement on June 30, 2009.
Widener Library Café
Staffed food service in Widener Library Café will be discontinued as of June 30. The Harvard College Library has subsidized this café service as a convenience for library staff and users, but given its proximity both to the Faculty Club and to eateries in Harvard Square, this cost-saving measure will allow the Library to retain more important services. Plans are underway to expand the vending selections, and the café will continue to have microwave ovens, hot water, an ice/water machine, and a filtered water cooler available.
Workflow and Processes for Greater Efficiency
Along with the FAS Human Resources Organizational Development (OD) team and in conjunction with the University’s Center for Workforce Development (CWD) team, departments, divisions, centers and tubs are assessing areas – such as in media services, library services, and building operations – where further restructuring and work process changes might yield new efficiencies.

FlyBy donned our Sunday best every day last week while heading to each house's spring formal. Our guide to the balls being inadequate, a more thorough investigation was necessary.  Below: Winthrop, Cabot/Pfoho, Currier, and Adams.
Winthrop:
If Winthrop’s formal—known to House insiders as the “Arbella Ball”—achieved anything last week, it was that it allowed guests to transcend both space and time. No, the event’s theme wasn’t “Take Me to the Moon” (thank God!). But the formal’s bifurcated set up—a dance party inside the JCR with a mildly classy live band and schmooze-fest outside in the Gore Courtyard—made FlyBy feel like  it was teleporting between Junior Prom and a wedding reception.
We give HoCo some credit. There was a little less angst and a little more inebriation in the JCR than at Prom. But throughout the night there were no real signs of a grand old time—no DFMOs, no dirty dancing, not really even too much bumping and/or grinding. FlyBy blames that on the cheesy disco light medley and the jaded turn-of-the-millennium playlist that included hits like “My Boo” and “Numa Numa.”
Outside, the ball’s live band was a nice accent. It was really cool to have the musicians of Soul Boston play at Winthrop… last year. But it was kind of a downer to hear the same neo-soul renditions of “Brick House” and Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” that we'd all broken it down to the year before.
Props to Winthrop for the open bar and a big shout out to the BAT team for making the drinks surprisingly strong. Pretty good deal considering both the $15 tickets and the fact that we’re in an economic crisis. Take that, Fête and your elitist $50 tickets.
Tips for next year? Hoco: minimize awkward teleportation by keeping everyone together in the Courtyard. Also, get a new band.
As for FlyBy: more time at the open bar.
Jump!
Cabot/Pfoho:
Though nothing in particular stood out at the Cabot/Pfoho formal, guests dolled up in above-the-knee dresses and well-cut tuxes left the great white tent on Moors Terrace slightly tipsy and reasonably satisfied. The food and drink selection were mediocre, the décor lovely but not especially memorable, and the music—let's just say DJ Strauss made for easy (and impassioned) conversation come Tuesday morning.
But overall, it was a lovely affair to remember. Stag attendees were in the minority, as dance floor participants consisted of couples dry-humping and making out to a barely recognizable Soulja Boy. Props to Cabot and Pfoho for a well planned and executed (p)formal. Too bad Cabot isn't speaking to its superimposed neighbor anymore after Pfoho made off with the remaining $800 worth of alcohol at the sweaty night's end.
Currier:
Though it was no liquid dream, Currier's House Formal certainly stood out from the rest: democratically elected (via a HoCo house list survey and unlike Leverett) to be "On a Boat," the formal set sail promising to be a revelrous booze cruise. But some parts of the ride were rocky, and the Tree House ended up with a formal that was more standard than stand-out.
First of all, attendees had to make a commitment: the nature of the event meant that partygoers arrived early and had to stay the entire evening. As a result, some angry Currierites were left at the dock, unable to partake in the ball. Even on the boat, Currierites ran into less-than-pleasant circumstances: drizzly weather kept couples from canoodling on the dock, and the more scenic upper level (and bar) was strictly 21+, leaving less-than-legals cooped up in the cabin. And though lines were short and drinks were ample, upstairs was not much better. The drinking level had all the ambiance of a hotel conference room and a less-than-green policy of one drink per cup. By the end of the night, the bar was littered with empty plastic vessels.
The DJ  for the evening was similarly mediocre -- it was, unsurprisingly, his first night captaining the turntables and he began with some country tunes that sounded dug up from the B-side of a minor Reba McIntyre album, and moved on to playing one too many throwback anthems and far too few top 40 hits.
That being said, the sound quality was good, environs were cozy, and those who'd invested in the occasion were intent to party.  Though the formal wasn't perfect, it's safe to say few, if any, Currierites were ready to jump ship.
Adams:
You've gotta give credit for spirit. Adams likes to go all out on things that involve dining privileges, decorating (stripper poles and cages at the House dance), and dressing up, especially as crazy things (drag night, fantasy night). In line with the Arabian Nights theme, there was a camel. Yes. Someone dressed as a camel to come to formal. There were also Frechmen with machine guns. Again...all out.
Despite being one of the cheapest formals on campus ($15 for a couple, $10 per person), HoCo didn't seem to skimp on anything. There was a fortune teller (yeah...), delicious snacks, and everything was meticulously decorated. After walking over a "magic carpet" to enter, you could go to the "harem"-themed library. Or, just head straight for the relatively empty dining hall to swing dance or the packed upper common room to grind on your date. And everyone else standing near you.

Quick!  Time is running out before you miss the 11th semi-annual 24 Hour Play Festival at the Adams House Pool Theatre.  The second and third performances of the night will be at 8:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.
FlyBy thought the concept was intriguing—five groups of writers, directors, and actors frantically working together to put on five one-act plays in 24 hours? We here one might even be a musical.
You can still get free tickets by emailing 24hplays@gmail.com.  Although, we have to say, if this semester’s plays are anything like this one, you might want to stay in and study instead.
Boo.  But FlyBy needs a way to procrastinate.  We’ll keep our fingers crossed for a good show.

It appears that Dean Michael Smith and our buddies at FAS have finally let the chips fall.  The budget cuts are out.  Much like our friend Bob Barker, FlyBy lets you know if each cut is a winner, or worth sending home.
The first thing to note about all this?  The $77 million in cuts detailed in today's announcements represents only 35% of the $220 million deficit for the 2010-2011 academic year.  So to a certain extent, why sweat the small stuff?
However, the cuts today do represent the single most visible step thus far in the quest to cut the budget.  Rumors have been flying around all year, and some students have already exercised their right to protest some of the administrations tactics.  But today, the Administration posted its concrete plans for all students to see.
While FlyBy is sure the administration would like for people to take a cursory glance at the over 18 pages (in MS Word) of cuts that will be made, we're here to break out the ones important to your life.

Actual Retail Price: Haha, this one is just funny.  "One Harvard", sounds a bit like one of FlyBy's favorite throwback mottos.  Harvard's too big to fail, right?
