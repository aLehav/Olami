After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 28, 2016 at 12:20 p.m.
Continuing years of long-shot efforts to reform the American electoral system, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig said Tuesday that at least 20 Republican members of the Electoral College may not cast their votes for President-elect Donald Trump.
Since Donald Trump’s upset victory in the 2016 presidential election, Lessig, who briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his anti-Trump group, "Electors Trust," have been working to offer legal advice to members of the Electoral College who are considering voting for a candidate that did not win the popular vote in their state. The group also promises to inform interested electors of how many others are planning to flip their votes.
Lessig has a history of supporting quixotic political reform causes. He created a political action committee in 2014 to fund candidates who supported campaign finance reform, but the group found little success getting its candidates elected. In Sept. 2015, he announced his candidacy for the presidency as a “referendum candidate” hoping to implement widespread campaign finance reform. Lessig dropped his presidential bid in Nov. 2015 after he failed to earn spots at televised Democratic debates during the primaries.
Trump, who won 306 electoral votes in the election Nov. 8, would need to lose 37 electoral votes to drop below the 270-vote threshold necessary to win the presidency. So far only one elector, Christopher Suprun of Texas, has publicly announced he will not be voting for Trump, even though the popular vote in Texas went to the Republican candidate.
Law School professor Michael J. Klarman wrote in an email that he finds it unlikely that electors will actually vote against Trump, citing the personal consequences and logistical difficulties as barriers to flipping votes.
“People are picked as electors because of their partisan reliability. The personal consequences—including death threats, I suspect, and certainly the end of their political careers—would be enormous,” Klarman wrote. “The system was intentionally designed to make it difficult to coordinate among the electors and to enforce any agreement among them.”
Government professor Theda R. Skocpol wrote in an email that she doesn’t expect red state electors would vote for anyone but Trump.
“I know of no one who thinks enough [electors] will flip to deny Trump the electors he won,” Skocpol said.
Law School professor and constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe ’62, along with a number of leading scholars in law and public policy, wrote a letter earlier this month encouraging electors to vote against Trump.
“This is the first time in American history that a large group of leading scholars have urged all Electors to vote against a particular presidential candidate as profoundly dangerous to our nation and our Constitution,” Tribe wrote in an email. “Maybe [Lessig] could help this unprecedented move get public attention.”
In his email, Klarman wrote that upending typical election procedures could present a threat to American democracy. On one hand, he wrote, electors flipping their votes undermines unwritten political rules that have governed our democracy for two centuries. But he also wrote that Trump’s presidency presents its own threats to American democratic values.
“I just don't think we've reached the point yet where we have to accept that democracy has failed.  It is threatened in a way that it has rarely been in our history, but there is still hope for its survival, and I think the electors’ rejecting Trump would actually dampen that hope,” Klarman said. “Trump will be, and should be given the election system we have (which is a stupid system, by the way), our next president.”
Lessig could not be reached for comment.

The headline of this article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 28, 2016
A headline on a previous version of this story incorrectly indicated the Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig said he he had flipped 20 electoral votes. In fact, Lessig only said he knew of 20 electoral votes that may flip; he did not say he had flipped the votes himself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two high school students who hope to attend the College filed a legal brief supporting Harvard's race-conscious admissions process, which has been challenged in an ongoing lawsuit that accuses the University of race-based discrimination.
The students, high school senior Jason Fong and a high school sophomore identified as M. A. in the legal documents, filed for amicus status—which would allow them to submit briefs and declarations to be treated as evidence and participate in oral arguments at different points in the case—on Dec. 12. They seek to join a group of current, prospective, and graduated Harvard students defending the College’s race-conscious admissions policies, who were granted amicus status in Dec. 2015 after their motion to intervene in the lawsuit was declined.
According to the motion, Fong, who is Asian American, has applied for admission to the Harvard College Class of 2021 and hopes to argue against the “claim that Asian American applicants are harmed by Harvard’s race-conscious holistic admissions policy.” M. A., who is of Pacific Islander descent, intends to apply for admission to Harvard in the future, according to the brief. Both are currently attending public schools in Southern California.
“I feel as though oftentimes Asian Americans are kind of used as a wedge group within the affirmative action debate. We’re kind of used to disparage other minority groups that may benefit from affirmative action,” Fong said in an interview. “That’s definitely why I wanted to voice my opinion as an Asian American who feels that we as a community benefit from affirmative action.”
Fong and M. A. are represented by Asian Americans Advancing Justice–Los Angeles, a legal and civil rights organization.
“As an Asian American civil rights group that supports affirmative action...we thought it was important that there were no Asian American applicants that were in that student group,” Nicole Ochi, the supervising attorney at AAAJ–LA for the high school students, said referring to the students who have already been granted amicus status. “We saw our role as recruiting more Asian American students whose voices could be a part of that diverse multi-racial coalition.”
The lawsuit started with a complaint filed by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in 2014 that alleged “holistic” admissions policies employed by Harvard put Asian American applicants at a disadvantage. Additionally, SFFA alleged that the University uses “racial balancing” and “racial quotas” when crafting each admit class.
Fong and M. A.’s motion states that the students seek to argue that considering race and ethnicity in college admissions can remedy the “adverse impact” some admissions practices have on the overall diversity of an admitted class. Examples of these admissions practices cited in the filing include “‘legacy’ applicants, Early Action, and reliance on the SAT.
AAAJ–LA hopes to have Fong and M. A. join the current amici in support of Harvard, who filed a brief defending Harvard’s affirmative action policies earlier this October.
Representatives from SFFA declined to comment on the motion.
