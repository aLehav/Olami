After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 9, 1969, roughly 500 student activists took over University Hall to protest Harvard’s role in the Vietnam War. City and state police armed with riot gear, clubs, and mace were called to remove all protesters who had vowed nonviolent resistance. In the early morning hours of April 10, over 400 police officers stormed University Hall, between 250 and 300 arrests were made, and 75 students were injured. In response, by April 11, thousands of Harvard students, teaching fellows, and faculty had gathered in Harvard Stadium to strike.
Fifty years later, the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers declared a strike, fighting for increased compensation, health benefits, and neutral third-party arbitration for sexual harassment and discrimination. On December 3, over 500 demonstrators, wearing on their shoulders large blue-and-white “UAW on Strike” placards, marched routes throughout the Yard. In the strike of 1969, strikers fought for social justice; in the HGSU-UAW strike of 2019, strikers press on the fight for fair wages and working conditions.
The right to strike is a right to resist oppression.
The strike (and the credible threat of a strike) is an indispensable part of the collective bargaining procedure. Collective bargaining (or “agreement-making”) provides workers and employees with the opportunity to influence the establishment of workplace rules that govern a large portion of their lives. The concerted withdrawal of labor allows workers to promote and defend their unprotected economic and social interests from employers’ unilateral decisions, and provide employers with pressure and incentives to make reasonable concessions. Functionally, strikes provide workers with the bargaining power to drive fair and meaningful negotiations, offsetting the inherent inequalities of bargaining power in the employer-employee relationship. The right to strike is essential in preserving and winning rights. Any curtailment of this right involves the risk of weakening the very basis of collective bargaining.
Strikes are not only a means of demanding and achieving an adequate provision of basic liberties but also are themselves intrinsic, self-determined expressions of freedom and human rights. The exercise of the power to strike affirms a quintessential corpus of values akin to liberal democracies, notably those of dignity, liberty, and autonomy. In acts of collective defiance, strikers assert their freedoms of speech, association, and assembly. Acts of striking, marching, and picketing command the attention of the media and prompt public forums of discussion and dialogue.
The question of civic obligations, however, remains at stake. Perhaps those disgruntled with the strike might claim on a whiff that the strike impedes upon their own freedom of movement, educational rights, privacy, and so forth. Do strikers, in virtue of expressing their own freedoms, shirk valid civic norms of reciprocity they owe to members of the community, for instance, to students? No. The right to strike stems from the premise of an unjust flaw in the social order, that is, the recognition that the benefits from shouldering the burdens of social cooperation are not fairly distributed. Strikes and protests publicize this recognition and demand reform.
No doubt, work stoppages from teaching fellows, course assistants, and graduate research assistants — no sections, no office hours, no labs, no grades — may pose inconvenience and perhaps hardship in our present lives. Strikes may also impose a serious financial cost on both the employer and the employees. These costs and inconveniences, however, should not be ridiculed as outrageous, for they rightfully invite disruption.
The possible hazards that arise from a strike must be weighed against the workers’ welfare and just rewards and to the community. For instance, current graduate students who struggle in financials and mental health may be troubled with juggling teaching obligations. If graduate students are provided with pay security and adequate dental, mental health, and specialist coverage, their quality of teaching and research may improve in the long run. There are dangers to bystanders and neutrals when a strike occurs, but such considerations also arise when one lays down the right to strike.
That said, if we should defend the right to strike, it must be meaningful. Both parties involved should strive to strike a deal — no pun intended — in good faith, and not merely act upon purposeless forms of virtue-signaling or anger-venting on chaotic impulse.
Nonetheless, provided the facts of injustice and repression, affected members should not only be permitted but highly encouraged (and obliged) to uptake the call of justice to restore broken institutions — be that through joining the pickets or standing in solidarity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are those who do not survive the events of their lives. When this happens in the service of one’s country, many people consider those people to be heroes. Heroes are meant to be honored, but what can you do when all that remains is the body of the hero, and not their name, nor any clue as to who they were in life besides the wreckage of their corpse? A common grave is given to those known in war as the “unknown soldiers,” and they are honored not for the sacrifice they gave, but for the sacrifice they represent.
There are unknown survivors, too, and not just of war, but of a sadly innumerable array of atrocities. Odds are you know a survivor. I am a survivor. The only honor most of us ever get is the time we still have left to live.
I’d like to share with you some things that I am a survivor of. At the age of 10, I survived multiple sexual assaults. A few years later, I survived the long and messy divorce of my parents. At the beginning of this semester, I found out that I have been living with depression my entire life, so, right now, I am surviving depression (antidepressants are helping me a lot).
Now, you may expect that I will receive an outpouring of praise and warmth for what I have just written, and I welcome it. But my pen should not make me more deserving of love than those of us who cannot bear to tell another soul what they have lived through, their pain is so great. My voice, my courage, my vulnerability should not make me the only recipient you know of the support of the community. No one should have to write what I have written to feel that their life is valid.
I think a survivor is anyone who has been made to confront their own mortality, anyone whose life could have easily been rewritten as a tragedy, anyone who has had to choose to still be alive.
And you are not just a survivor once you’ve survived something traumatic, you are a survivor every single day afterwards, too, and you will always be a survivor so long as you continue to choose to lead your life the way you want to, in spite of all that you have lived through. You are a survivor because wherever you go, you carry the burden of your trauma with you. Sadly, many survivors choose to end their own lives as a way to escape their suffering, and so we do not just survive once, but our survival is a daily feat of willpower.
This column is the last time I will tell you that I am a survivor. You can know that I will always be one, because there are no gradations, there are no levels, there is no hierarchy of pain. Pain is pain is pain is pain is pain. Every strain is equally abominable, ought equally to be our collective enemy, might equally affect any one of us.
Odds are you know a survivor. Do not ask us to tell you what we have survived, or that we are survivors, or to qualify our pain at all. We have no one face, no one gender, no one complexion, no one religion, no one single trait held in common but perhaps the dark and telling look that fills our eyes when we are made to think of the past.
So, if we are to honor the unknown survivors who walk among us, with whom we laugh and chat and interact each and every day of our lives, let us build within each of our hearts a “Tomb of the Unknown Survivor,” so we might have a place to honor every ghost and mind and memory that wanders the earth without sharing its pain.
It is estimated that in all of history over a hundred billion human beings have lived, and most have known pain. Those of us still alive today are not so different, really. And so, as the dead do not need to explain their deaths to elicit our deepest sympathies, so, too, might we show those human beings who still share the world with us today the great depths of our love and compassion, and not ask them to explain to us the death that almost was their life.
Most of what we call our humanity is at odds with the principles of suffering. In fact, I believe we are most human when we alleviate the suffering of others, and that is essentially the foundation of any healthy community. We may differ in the sources of our trauma, but we are all alike in our suffering — like a jewel found deep within the hollow earth, the weight of the world has only served to make us a thing of beauty, brilliance, and of strength.
This is all to say, so long as there are people in your life, treasure them, and share with them the love you might reserve for the victims of the worst atrocities you can imagine. Who knows, you might just be right.
And remember, it’s easy to praise a writer — it’s hard to change your life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At its meeting earlier this month, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences considered a proposal calling on the Harvard Corporation to direct Harvard Management Company to divest from fossil fuels. It was the first time Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 attended a faculty meeting in his 44 years at the University.
But this was not the most unusual part of the meeting. University President Lawrence S. Bacow asked a student protesting the decision to deny Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña tenure to move so as not to obstruct faculty members’ view. When the student refused to do so, Bacow asked for the faculty’s support in removing the student, but several faculty voiced objections, and the student remained.
First, we deeply appreciate the time that faculty members took to debate the proposed divestment motion. We take the mere fact of the proposal debate and Lee’s unprecedented attendance as a sign of progress: more higher-ranking bodies in this University are giving the notion of divestment serious thought. Clearly, the faculty has had serious conversations regarding the efficacy, symbolism, and impact of divestment.
In light of recent protests and national coverage, it is especially important that the University consider why the issue of divestment has risen to such prominence over the past few years, and how it has interacted with student activists.
In that vein, we’d like to speak directly to Harvard Magazine’s coverage of the protester who stood in on the meeting. After describing exchanges between Bacow and the student, who refused to move or give their name, the magazine, which is editorially independent of the University, wrote, “In contrast, the discussion on divestment was completely civil, and on a high intellectual plane.” This comment in the article is blatantly condescending. The article, through this statement, seems to claim that unlike the faculty present for the discussion, protesters are uncivil and anti-intellectual. We believe that this language reflects broader attitudes of condescension toward student protesters and a misunderstanding of the motives behind protest.
It is important for all of us to understand that protest of this intensity that comes only after a prolonged period of feeling disempowered and disregarded. For the Harvard Magazine article to treat this protest as immature and to report it with a condescending tone is inappropriate. Such an attitude fails to contextualize the role the University has played and continues to play in perpetuating the conditions that led to students expressing their opinions in this manner.
We are encouraged by the time and thought the faculty have put into discussing the proposal to call on the University to divest, and we hope that their efforts will be met with equally thoughtful conversation by members of the Corporation. We hope that going forward, the efforts of protesters will be met first with consideration rather than condescension.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An animal rights group alleges Harvard Medical School caused the death of an experimental primate and filed “fraudulent” reports with the United States Department of Agriculture, according to a federal complaint the group filed with the United States Department of Agriculture Nov. 30.
Michael A. Budkie, co-founder of the activist group Stop Animal Exploitation Now, wrote the complaint, which alleges the actions of HMS researchers constituted violations of the Animal Welfare Act.
HMS administrators filed a report with the National Institutes of Health in September detailing the death of a macaque in an HMS lab.
"On July 28, 2019, the [principal investigator] discovered a dead juvenile macaque,” the report to the NIH reads. “The macaque had strangled herself on her hanging surrogate cover, which was being used for enrichment. The macaque had ripped a hole in the surrogate cover and stuck her head through it.”
The macaque’s death represents a violation of the Animal Welfare Act, according to SAEN. The complaint accuses researchers of failing to handle animals “as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.”
HMS spokesperson Ekaterina D. Pesheva wrote in an emailed statement that the school is committed to high ethical standards in animal experimentation.
“We will continue to work to ensure that the important research will further medical breakthroughs, while being conducted in an ethical manner,” she wrote. “We recognize that it is incumbent upon us to continuously strive to improve our program and strengthen oversight in order to exceed the highest standards.”
SAEN’s complaint also alleges that the experiment entailed the social isolation of primates.
“Since this project involves socially isolating primates, including preventing them from even seeing human or primate faces, it is highly likely that this project caused these animals to experience unrelieved distress,” Budkie wrote in the complaint.
The complaint noted that, though the project began in 2015, neither of HMS’s last two annual reports — filed with the USDA — disclosed primates being subjected to unrelieved pain or distress.
The complaint cited USDA guidelines requiring researchers to report “the common names and the numbers of animals upon which teaching, experiments, research, surgery, or tests were conducted involving accompanying pain or distress to the animals.”
“HMS has therefore filed several fraudulent reports with the USDA,” the complaint reads.
The complaint concludes by calling upon the USDA to launch an investigation into the incident and punish the “criminal” laboratory with a fine.
Budkie said his organization believes the incident reveals significant issues with animal experimentation at Harvard.
“If Harvard can’t even keep the animals alive long enough to complete the experiments, then why should we believe they can do science?” Budkie said in an interview Monday.
HMS shuttered its New England Primate Research Center in 2015, after four primates died between 2010 and 2012. Jeffrey S. Flier, then-dean of HMS, said the center closed for financial reasons.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a week after Harvard’s graduate students union began its indefinite strike, both University administrators and union negotiators have yet to schedule any new sessions to work toward a contract.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers went on strike Dec. 3 after voting members overwhelmingly approved of a strike in a strike authorization vote late October. Negotiations, which began in October 2018, had produced 12 tentative proposals during the 28 bargaining sessions that preceded the strike. Differences, however, remain on key issues including compensation, health benefits, and a grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination cases.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Friday that the University has spent the past week evaluating an updated proposal submitted Dec. 2 by the graduate students union.
“We’ve exchanged proposals. We’re evaluating their proposal and will be coming back to them with another,” Bacow said. “So you know, negotiations continue.”
Bacow said Friday that new bargaining sessions have not yet been scheduled because the University needed time to thoroughly analyze the most recent proposal.
“It takes a while to actually analyze a proposal. There are lots of dimensions to it and trying to understand the economic impact for the University,” Bacow said. “That requires consultation with a bunch of different schools because it has different consequences for different schools.”
But on Tuesday, University negotiators offered a date for the next bargaining sessions with the union, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email that evening.
Over the past several days, union organizers have decried the lack of bargaining sessions since the beginning of the strike, and said Harvard has not been responsive to their requests for scheduling more bargaining sessions.
“I just want to make it clear, they have not come to the table at all,” Lisa Xu, an organizer with the United Automobile Workers, said in a rally Tuesday before the next session was offered. “We sent them an email on Monday before our strike began asking them when our next bargaining session would be, and they have not replied. Our inbox is empty.”
Members and supporters of the union have been picketing at Harvard’s Cambridge and Longwood campuses every weekday since the beginning of the strike. HGSU – which boasts a 4,000 strong membership across the University – represents graduate and undergraduate teaching staff, as well as graduate research assistants.
Striking union members have withheld their teaching responsibilities — including holding office hours, grading assignments, and proctoring final exams — and halted all paid research responsibilities not included in their academic programs during the strike. Protestors also picketed in front of loading docks and delivery entrances across Harvard to block deliveries.
Bacow also said that while the University hopes to come to an agreement with the union soon, they’ll be prepared if the strike continues into the new year.
“It's our hope that it won't come to that, but we try to anticipate and plan for every contingency,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of ethnic studies scholars within and outside of Harvard signed two letters condemning the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña.
More than 200 senior scholars across the United States who specialize in fields including Ethnic Studies, Women’s and Gender Studies, and American Studies sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Monday. The signatories include feminist theorist bell hooks and famed political activist and scholar Angela Davis.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences ladder faculty who work and teach in ethnic studies also circulated their own open letter to Harvard affiliates Tuesday. The nine signatories comprise chairs, directors, and administrators of University institutions that support ethnic and indigenous studies research and teaching, including the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights and the Committee on Degrees in History and Literature.
The University informed García Peña — who specializes in Latinx studies — of the tenure decision Nov. 27. Since then, University affiliates have protested the verdict by penning letters to top administrators, hosting a rally, staging a sit-in at University Hall, and interrupting a faculty meeting.
Both letters cite García Peña’s previous accomplishments and mentorship to students of color as evidence of Harvard’s misevaluation of her merits. During her nearly seven-year tenure at the University, she helped establish an ethnic studies track in History and Literature, published a book on Dominican racial and national identity to critical acclaim, and received multiple awards from the University for her teaching.
García Peña did not respond to a request for comment.
The nationwide letter argues the tenure denial signals that the University does not find ethnic studies “intellectually significant” in the tenure process.
hooks, who signed the nationwide letter, wrote in a press release Monday that Harvard’s tenure decision represents a systemic inattention to the academic value of Black and Latinx Studies.
“Dr. García Peña’s scholarship and service is the cornerstone to continue building Ethnic Studies as a leading program at Harvard and her absence would be a detriment to the students and faculty that depend on her keen insight,” wrote hooks, who is also an Appalachian Studies professor at Berea College.
The faculty letter contends that the tenure verdict would stifle growing numbers of students who are interested in studying ethnic studies at Harvard. Currently, 20 students are pursuing an ethnic studies subfield in the History and Literature concentration, and 65 are pursuing a secondary in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, according to the letter.
“The recent denial of tenure to Professor Lorgia García Peña has severe repercussions on our efforts, especially given our small numbers, to respond to students’ growing interest in ethnic studies courses and advising, to recruit and retain top faculty working in our fields, and to participate in the university’s mission of fostering diversity, inclusion, and excellence,” the faculty letter reads.
Asked for comment, FAS spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven pointed to an email FAS Dean Claudine Gay sent Monday reiterating her commitment to building ethnic studies at Harvard. She wrote that prioritizing faculty hiring will increase the likelihood of an ethnic studies program’s long-term success at Harvard.
“A program without a strong, vibrant cohort of committed faculty is destined to fail, and this cannot fail. It is far too important,” she added.
Gay has launched a nationwide search to hire three to four faculty members who specialize in Asian American, Muslim American, and Latinx studies. The search committee has compiled a list of candidates, some of whom will come to campus to give lectures and meet with faculty and students, according to Gay.
But signatories of both letters contend that García Peña’s tenure denial contradicts the ongoing ethnic studies cluster hire and Harvard’s broader efforts to promote diversity and belonging on its campus and in its curricula.
“Universities cannot simultaneously pledge a commitment to diversity and inclusion, and not take seriously the knowledge produced by and for communities that have long been excluded from or marginalized within the academy,” the faculty letter reads.
The nationwide letter calls on Harvard to lead academics in expanding the definition of “areas worthy of research” to include the fields of ethnic studies and Afro-Latinx Studies, as well as create the “intellectual space” for such efforts through its hiring and tenuring processes.
The letters follow recent efforts by students and administrators to start a conversation about the future of ethnic studies at Harvard.
Roughly 40 students from the Ethnic Studies Coalition staged a 45-minute-long sit-in in the Office of the Provost — located on the eighth floor of the Smith Campus Center — Monday afternoon.
Lowell House faculty deans David Laibson and Nina Zipser — who also serves as Dean of Faculty Affairs — held a house discussion about ethnic studies with students and Dean of the Arts and Humanities Robin Kelsey Monday night.
“We discussed the critical importance of improving the diversity of scholarship, teaching, and mentorship at Harvard, with particular focus on ethnic studies,” Laibson wrote in an email. “We discussed the disproportionate burden placed on faculty of color, in part, because they are substantially underrepresented among Harvard's faculty.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Honor Council saw a drop in the number of cases it heard during the 2018-2019 academic year, posting only 64 for the year in the annual report it released last week.
This year’s figure is down from the 88 cases the Honor Council heard during the 2017-2018 academic year. The council’s report speculated that the decrease in the number of cases may reflect an improvement in academic integrity at the College, or that it may indicate less frequent reporting of incidents.
“This decline may suggest that there are fewer instances of academic dishonesty and that efforts to strengthen the culture of integrity on campus are having an impact,” the report reads. “At the same time, the decline may also in part reflect a reduction in detection or reporting to the Honor Council, especially with respect to less serious concerns.”
In 52 of the 64 cases — just over 80 percent — the Honor Council found students responsible for academic violations.
The Honor Council hears cases on violations of the College’s academic regulations, including cases related to plagiarism, inappropriate collaboration, cheating on exams, and academic dishonesty. The disciplinary body has 24 voting members. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana chairs the council; Brett Flehinger and Brigitte A. B. Libby, associate and assistant deans for academic integrity and student conduct, respectively, served as co-secretaries of the council in the 2018-2019 academic year.
The Honor Council may respond to academic violations with punishments ranging from formal warnings — or “admonitions” — to recommendations for dismissal or expulsion.
In 2018-2019, the council referred seven students for “local sanctions” from course heads, admonished 14 students, placed 17 students on probation, and required 14 to withdraw from the College. Withdrawals are normally temporary; the council’s report did not indicate that it issued any recommendations for dismissal or expulsion.
The number of cases adjudicated by the Honor Council peaked in the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 academic years, clocking in at 115 and 128 cases, respectively. More than 60 cases from the 2016-2017 school year stemmed from a single course — Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science."
Consistent with previous years, the majority of cases this year — 47 of 64 — implicated freshmen and sophomores. Also in line with previous reports, most cases originated in science and engineering courses.
“Furthermore, as noted above, as the total number of cases decreases, the percentage of total cases involving first-year students has been increasing annually,” the report reads. “A broader pattern is clearly emerging, in which students early in their academic careers are overrepresented and juniors and seniors are underrepresented.”

Dean of Harvard College Rakesh Khurana said in an interview Tuesday that his office is focused on “minimizing the disruptions” for College students in the event that the graduate student union’s strike continues through the beginning of next semester.
Members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers began a work stoppage one week ago, following more than a year of contract negotiations with University administrators. HGSU-UAW boasts 4,000 members, including graduate and undergraduate teaching fellows, course assistants, and research assistants.
Khurana said Tuesday that his office is working to minimize undergraduates’ discomfort during the strike alongside administrators from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Office of Undergraduate Education, the Registrar’s Office, and the Office for Faculty Affairs.
“Our focus at the College right now is to do what we can to minimize any disruption to the undergraduate experience,” he said.
Several classes at the College have already changed locations, switched exam formats, and canceled review sessions in response to the week-old strike. Graduate students and faculty have instead taken to picketing in Harvard Yard, hoisting signs and singing labor-themed carols as they call on the University to change its position on several key contract measures.
The union and the University have reached agreements over 12 contract measures, but are currently debating competing proposals regarding compensation, health care benefits, and grievance procedures for complaints of sexual misconduct and discrimination. The union has not announced an end date to the strike.
The strike may delay academic departments’ ability to report grades and prepare students’ transcripts. In some cases, students need finalized grades and transcripts in order to apply for jobs, postgraduate fellowships, and graduate schools. Khurana did not comment on specific measures the College is taking to address grading delays.
“In situations like that, we are working with individual departments and faculty and students to share those kinds of concerns and do our best in these circumstances to address those issues,” he said.
Khurana added that the College is currently planning for a strike that stretches into next semester’s shopping week, when classes usually finalize their course staff and set up discussion sections.
“We are focused on minimizing the disruptions for our students,” Khurana said. “We will work together with our various offices to try to minimize disruption and provide guidelines and instruction for managing registration, new classes, et cetera.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Masses of College students streaked around the perimeter of Harvard Yard at the stroke of midnight Monday as part of “Primal Scream,” a school tradition.
Around twenty minutes before midnight, members of the Harvard University Band — most of whom donned only their underwear and red coats — congregated around the John Harvard statue and performed for the gathered crowds of spectators and semi-nude and nude students. The student conductor climbed atop the statue to orchestrate the band below.
Participants gathered in front of Hollis Hall shortly before midnight, shouting “I believe that we will win!” and chanting part of The White Stripes’s song, 'Seven Nation Army'. As the run finally approached, one person began counting down from five seconds, before the mass of streakers headed in a counterclockwise direction around the yard. Ivan Jara-Marquez ’23, a Crimson Design editor, said congestion early on in the lap in front of Matthews Hall resulted in chaos.
“It was a good jog,” he said, while looking for his footwear after the run. “My feet hurt a bit. I ran with flip-flops, but then I lost a flip-flop and then I lost the other flip-flop.”
The biannual event, now decades-old, involves students running at least one lap in the nude around Harvard Yard at midnight at the end of each semester’s reading period, signifying the beginning of final exams for the fall or spring term.
Conditions around midnight were humid with a light, on-and-off drizzle. This winter's Primal Scream participants ran in temperatures hovering around the high-50s.
Benjamin Chang ’23 said he was grateful his first Primal Scream occurred in what he described as optimal conditions.
“It’s beautiful. It’s perfect weather, almost 60 degrees," he said. "The rain just makes it way more fun."
A number of tourists and other spectators photographed the procession of streakers, which caused mixed feelings among the participating students. Maria V. Paredes ’20, who participated for the first time, said she was annoyed at one photographer who she said pointed his camera at her. “But, what are you going to do, I guess?” she said. “Not worth not doing it.”
Running through the final leg of the lap, one streaker swatted a spectator’s phone out of his hand into a puddle, while others made an effort to cover up when passing that spectator-heavy portion of the lap.
Jonathan C. Luo ’23 said he was not bothered by the presence of spectators, even those taking photographs.
“I kind of just tuned them out,” Luo said. “I didn’t even notice them, honestly.”
Afterward, some groups of streakers gathered in front of the John Harvard statue, taking group pictures to commemorate the event.

As hundreds of graduate student union members and their supporters have cycled through picket lines across campus over the past week, students like Soufiane A. Aboulhouda, a Medical Sciences Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, have decided not to join their ranks.
Aboulhouda, who also conducts research at Harvard Medical School, cited his obligation to his students and his research colleagues as motivation to continue teaching even as others have set aside their work to disrupt deliveries, picket buildings, and spread the word about the graduate student strike.
As Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers enters the second week of its strike, 19 graduate and undergraduate students who have chosen not to strike shared their decision with The Crimson. Their reasons range from a sense of duty to their peers and students, to financial hardships they believe would come with joining the strike, to fear about what a work stoppage might mean for international students’ visas. Others simply do not agree with everything the union is asking for in its contract negotiations with Harvard.
HGSU began its indefinite strike Dec. 3 after roughly 13 months of negotiations with the University on its first contract. Though the two parties have reached agreements on 12 provisions over the past year, they remain at odds on key issues, including compensation, health care, and grievance procedures for harassment and discrimination. More than 90 percent of union voters approved a strike in late October.
“I think I can understand why a strike is being organized considering the breadth and depth of the student body that the union covers,” Aboulhouda said. “I think many of them are perfectly justified to ask for what they're asking. But yes, I have prior commitments and so my main thought is that I have 12 hours of work to do, and I've got to get it done before the break.”
Daniel J. Richard, a third-year Ph.D. student in Human Evolutionary Biology, said that financial considerations have made it impossible for him to join the picket line.
He said that fulfilling his teaching responsibilities — which include teaching a lab section and grading exams for Life Sciences 2: “Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy” — is necessary because he relies on his pay from the University.
“I cannot afford to stop working,” he said. “If I don't get a paycheck this month, I will not be able to cover rent for this month.”
The union is offering strike benefits to those who walk the picket line or perform other strike duties for an average of four hours each week. These benefits include $275 per week for each picketer from the UAW’s strike fund. The fund will go into effect after the strike has gone on for eight days and if the University docks individual strikers’ pay.
Richard, however, dismissed the strike fund as “vastly inadequate to my living expenses.”
For international students, financial issues are not the only concern — because they are on academic visas, striking brings uncertainty to their ability to remain in the United States.
International student Tanush Jagdish, a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Biology, said that going on strike poses a “huge risk.”
“I do empathize with a lot of people who are struggling, but unfortunately, it's a huge risk to take with my visa and immigration status, too,” Jagdish said. “All the scenarios that might occur are very unlikely, I'm sure, but if you weigh that against the possible risks, I just think it's not worth it.”
Several undergraduate course assistants — who are represented by the union — said that while they may support the union’s demands, they feel an obligation to their students and faculty members to continue teaching and do not necessarily believe they would benefit as much as graduate students from the eventual contract.
Elijah Tai ’22, a course assistant in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” said that while he agrees with the striking workers, his “primary goal” is to educate and excite students about computer science.
“For me personally, I have an obligation to teach because when I signed up to be a staff member for CS50, one of the things I said was that I would work really, really hard and to teach people as much as possible,” Tai said.
Tai added that going on strike would take away “crucial support” for students as they work on their final projects.
In Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” most of the undergraduate staff is not striking, according to course assistants Michael G. Isakov ’22 and Justin Zhu ’21.
Isakov said that while many of the union’s proposals are “reasonable,” some are less relevant to undergraduates, such as paid leave.
“There aren’t a lot of people who are adamantly against any particular proposal that is being put forward,” Isakov said. “It’s more of the sense that a lot of the issues don’t apply to us and, thus, we don’t have as much of an incentive to strike.”
Zhu said that he decided to continue working because he feels that undergraduates can “bridge the dichotomy” between the University and the union.
“I see my role as helping the professors who really have no dog in this fight while at the same time, you know, kind of making sure that the overall academic culture at Harvard is still sustainable and thriving,” Zhu said.
Still, some students said they are not striking because they do not agree with some of the union’s demands.
A third-year male graduate student in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences who is not striking said that though he supports the union’s desired grievance procedure, he takes issue with the union’s specific compensation and health care proposals. The student, who does not want to be named because he is concerned about jeopardizing relationships with peers, said he believes getting paid to study at Harvard in the first place is a privilege, and he considers the calls for increased compensation and benefits to be ungrateful.
HGSU organizers did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
While many student workers have decided not to strike, that choice does not always go unnoticed by their peers in the union.
A female student in GSAS, who is not striking because she believes the union’s demands are too strong and feels a duty to her students, contends that the union has created an adversarial culture for those who choose not to join the pickets. She requested anonymity because she fears retaliation for criticizing the union’s position.
The student characterized the union as having created a with-us-or-against-us culture that has bred hostility toward those who have decided not to go on strike. She said that she is afraid to share her views on the union with her peers and that this fear has affected her relationships and her emotional state.
She said strong supporters of the union have repeatedly sent messages to her private email and cell phone asking her to sign up to strike, which she said she never agreed to and infringes on her privacy.
Still, the student said she does not believe that the union as a whole is responsible for promoting this attitude. Rather, she believes that its most zealous supporters have created what she called a hostile atmosphere.
Throughout the strike, union members on the picket lines have discussed holding text banks to reach out to their peers and encourage involvement in the strike. The female GSAS student said she does not find it appropriate to contact individual members about their choice to participate in the strike.
“Can you confirm whether or not you are withholding labor?” reads one of the text messages sent to the student from a union member and reviewed by The Crimson.
Several other students, including a male teaching fellow in the Physics department, said he feels social pressure to not speak out in opposition to the union. The Physics student requested anonymity due to the peer pressure he feels at work.
For student workers like Aboulhouda, however, his duty to his students and his academic progress ultimately have driven his decision not to participate.
“The primary reason I’m not striking is to follow up on the commitments that I’ve made to others, as well as to myself to push my research forward efficiently,” he said.

Even though the temperature is below freezing, there has never been a better time for ice cream. We evaluated four frozen dessert locations around Harvard Square based on flavor, texture, size, and importantly, price. To even the playing field, we sampled each location’s most popular flavor, ranging from classics like cookie dough to newcomers like blueberry cheesecake. Check out our reviews below!
J.P. Licks
Flavors: Cookies and Cream, Pumpkin Cheesecake
JP Licks never disappoints in terms of flavor — its crown jewel, the Cookies and Cream, is thick and rife with Oreo crumbles, packing a flavorful punch. The Pumpkin Cheesecake is a unique take on a classic dessert, with a subtle cheesecake flavor. But if you’re considering JP Licks for a mid-study session pick-me-up, beware: its prices are laughably exorbitant for the portions you get. Nonetheless, it is and always will be a Square staple and a “treat yo’ self” destination.
Ben & Jerry’s
Flavor: Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
Ben & Jerry’s is known to many as a grocery store classic, given their colorful pints and outrageous flavors. Making the trek to the Ben & Jerry’s in the Garage, we were surprised to hear that their most popular flavor is Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. While the texture was smooth, there was an uneven distribution of dough and chip, leaving us wishing we had stuck to the pre-packaged pints instead. However, the generous portions ensure you at least get that bang for your buck.
Berryline
Flavor: Original with Mochi and Oreo Cheesecake Toppings
After a filling meal of sweet potato fries from the dhall, Berryline is the place to hit up for a sweet and semi-healthy treat. We tried the Original flavor, which comes with a tart yet incredibly creamy texture that acts as a blank canvas for the toppings of your dreams. We chose mochi, a chewy and subtly sweet topping that would make any Trader Joe’s fan swoon. Unfortunately, the oreo cheesecake we chose had an overwhelming cookie crust and didn’t quite deliver on its cheesecake promises. At only $4 for a relatively large portion, though, Berryline is the perfect way for you to convince yourself that it’s okay that you slept through that exercise class at the MAC — and sample some yummy toppings as well.
Amorino
Flavors: Blueberry Cheesecake, Pistachio, L’Inimitable
If this was Buzzfeed’s Worth It, Amorino would have three dollar signs and there would be classical music playing in the background. The decadent gelato flavors actually lived up to their names, from the rich creaminess of the Blueberry Cheesecake to the luscious Nutella-esque L’Inimitable. With each bite tasting deliciously expensive, our broke college student palates found the portions to be far too small and the cost too high for our liking. On the bright side, a few scoops would certainly make for a fantastic post-exam treat or dessert date destination!
HUDS Froyo
Flavors: Vanilla, Mango, Dulce de Leche, Chocolate, etc.
The HUDS froyo machine is the layman’s favorite source of dessert when the Square is too far and funds are running low. With alternating flavors each week, the frozen yogurt in the dhalls is a surprisingly solid choice to round out your meal. Dulce de Leche is a known fan-favorite, and if you manage to grab a cone on the same night that the brownie bar is out, you have easy access to a variety of toppings. The best part? It’s free!
With exam season looming on the horizon, everyone on this campus deserves some sort of frozen treat. We hope this guide helps you find both your dessert of choice and your sanity just in time for finals!
