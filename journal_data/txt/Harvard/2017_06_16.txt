After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past few months, several states have considered or passed legislation aimed at undermining science education. These efforts are part of a growing misunderstanding of science—including the value of science education—in the public sphere. Scientific thinking is about much more than crunching p-values or lone-wolf theorizing; it is a means of thinking critically that contextualizes findings with the contributions of centuries of collective experience. Like all of us, scientists may be motivated by personal interests, but a scientific thinker instinctively doubts their results. A fundamental emphasis on rigor, evidenced by a culture of constructive criticism, elevates the pursuit of truth to a higher standard.
Above all, scientific thinking is not a distant abstraction. It is immediately relevant in day-to-day decision-making, owing to the fact that we are often called on to reach conclusions or make decisions with limited information—how to spend our days, plan outings and trips, steer the direction of our educations and careers, pursue or halt hobbies, among many others—all with an incomplete picture of the future. Scientific thinking lends itself to weighing evidence and arriving at reasonable conclusions that we can count on ourselves to make time and time again. It is valuable in its own right.
STEM students at Harvard are well-acquainted to this vision of science education. A remarkable degree of attention to the science curriculum has resulted in introductory science courses that rarely present science as a series of facts to know. Instead, these classes routinely and extensively deal with sophisticated scientific thinking. In their problem sets, lectures, and labs, they present research narratives—histories of scientific thinkers overcoming intellectual and technical obstacles in the pursuit of truth.
STEM students at Harvard are better off for knowing these histories of scientific inquiry, but the problem is that it is all too easy to attend Harvard for four years without taking a single science class of this caliber, even with the General Education program. Courses specifically fulfilling the STEM Gen Ed categories are not always taken as seriously as introductory STEM classes. Indeed, it seems students seeking to fulfill science Gen Ed requirements rarely view them as more than pesky chores, as Q Guide comments for science Gen Eds sometimes validate such classes on the basis of the effort necessary to do well.
Addressing society’s rejection of science begins at Harvard by genuinely committing to science literacy for every graduate. One way to approach this goal is to incorporate science-minded skill objectives into the Writing Program’s Expos curriculum, including instruction on reading and writing scientific manuscripts, designing and interpreting experiments, and weighing scientific evidence.
While some Expos sections are roughly scientific in subject matter, the ultimate goal is the same for all sections: learn to think like a humanist. Since Harvard’s mandatory course in expository writing is ostensibly a primer for rigorous scholarly thought, learning to think like a scientist should be an equally estimable goal in the course. This is critical if Harvard is to demonstrate its dedication to science education.
With this approach, there is an obvious need for a second instructor, a scientist, to be involved at some point in the course.  This collaboration of instructors would have the added benefit of fostering collaboration and breaking down barriers between the humanities and sciences. For those who bypass the Expos requirement, like students who take a year of Humanities 10, there should be a dedicated science writing class that touches on some of these skills. Currently, the lack of science writing classes is a glaring omission in the course catalog.
Regardless of the approach, Harvard should draw inspiration from peer institutions that have championed science education. For example, MIT’s Gen Ed analog, General Institution Requirements, features a communication requirement within each major, including STEM, humanities, and the social sciences. While this falls short of a universal science writing requirement, it demonstrates a commitment to science education that goes beyond Harvard’s.
Furthermore, MIT’s graduate program in science writing, focusing on the effective presentation of science and technology to the public, is precisely the dedication to science education for which Harvard should aim. Of course, MIT’s heightened emphasis on science education is in line with its mission as a STEM-focused institution, but Harvard is also a liberal arts institution seeking to offer a well-rounded education that sculpts future leaders at a time when STEM is both increasingly relevant and under fire.
Harvard should take steps to prioritize undergraduate science learning, especially given the current political climate. The Writing Program is well-positioned to take on this challenge given its goal to establish a strong foundation for undergraduate scholarship. Proficiency in scientific thinking, which goes hand-in-hand with clear science writing, is valuable in its own right as a powerful means of critical thinking. And fostering powerful critical thinking is vital to the College’s mission to prepare its students to be leaders in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Scattered across the country on summer vacation Wednesday, Harvard students and newly minted graduates checked their emails, opened text messages, or clicked on attention-grabbing headlines to learn the news—University President Drew G. Faust will step down in June 2018.
A few said they were shocked. Others said they were indifferent.
But many stopped what they were doing—commuting to a summer internship, waiting for a flight, relaxing at home—to reflect on the decade-long career and legacy of Harvard’s first female president.
Some students and alumni said they had strong, knee-jerk reactions to the news. Savannah N. Fritz ’17, who graduated just weeks ago, immediately looked to the selection of the University’s next president.
Fritz said she had only one thought: “God, I hope they find a woman.”
“I hope they find another woman because it was pretty historic having her as the first woman president—the same with President Obama, being a pioneer after all this white male leadership,” she added.
Adam E. Harper ’20, a member of the Undergraduate Council, said he immediately wanted to know why Faust plans to resign.
He said he wondered whether “there is a reason behind” her decision to step down. Harper asked himself if the College’s rollout of a controversial policy targeting single-gender social clubs—a policy poorly received by some faculty and students—could have factored into Faust’s decision.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates Wednesday announcing her departure and titled “Future Plans,” Faust wrote that she is timing her departure to coincide with the end of Harvard’s capital campaign, which has raised more than $8 billion. She called this “the right time for the transition to Harvard’s next chapter, led by a new president.”
Some current and former students particularly praised Faust’s ability to raise money. Under her guidance, the University’s capital campaign surpassed its $6.5 billion goal two years ahead of schedule, shattering higher education fundraising records in the process.
Kyle Kwong ’17, who was at the airport when he found out Faust planned to step down, wrote in a text message that he thought Faust’s success with the capital campaign was “impressive.” Kwong, a former Crimson editor, wrote that his earliest memory of Faust dates to the announcement of the fundraising campaign back in 2013, when he was a freshman at the College.
“I just remember thinking, ‘Who in the world thinks Harvard needs more money, and how is she going to convince anyone to donate?’” Kwong wrote. “And then she did. I'd say that's pretty impressive.”
Others pointed to what they called Faust’s steady leadership under intense pressure and a glaring national spotlight. Riding home from work on the subway, Matthew J. Vegari ’17 said he thought Faust led Harvard through a “pivotal era,” steering the University past the turmoil of the 2008 economic downturn. Harper agreed, but applauded Faust’s guidance during more recent crises.
“She’s most of all done a good job maintaining the reputation of Harvard on a national stage at a time when we were under a lot of scrutiny,” Harper said, referring to several “high-profile incidents” including Faust’s decision to cancel the men’s soccer team’s season after The Crimson reported the men rated their female counterparts based on perceived sexual appeal and physical appearance.
But for some, including Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 and Jessica R. Fournier ’17, Faust’s “stable” leadership style proved a drawback. Roberts and Fournier—both of whom were involved with campus activist groups while undergraduates—said they thought that Faust largely worked to ensure Harvard stayed the same, ignoring calls for change from students, faculty, and some outsiders.
Roberts and Fournier said they were especially disappointed by Faust’s repeated refusals to divest Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment from fossil fuels. Fournier said she thought actions like these demonstrated Faust’s willingness to “toe the line.” Roberts called Faust’s legacy “one of continuity.”
“For me, Drew Faust represents the epitome of the status quo,” Roberts said. “That is certainly for the worse, because we are living in a time now where it is very difficult not to take sides. If you are not on the side of protecting certain communities, then it is very difficult to say you are not harming them.”
Both Roberts and Fournier said they felt largely indifferent to Faust’s impending departure. Among surveyed members of the Class of 2017, 35 percent reported viewing Faust favorably, while 41 percent reported having no opinion.
Although Jake H. Hummer ’17 said he also did not have “strong feelings” about the news, Faust’s announcement led him to reflect on a personal memory of the president. He said he ran into Faust in Harvard Yard by chance on move-in day his freshman year, and again four years later during his graduation. Both times, he took a picture with her.
“So I took a selfie with Drew Faust on my first week on campus and my last week on campus,” Hummer said, adding he thought the photos were “pretty cool.”
His one regret: wearing a “cringeworthy Mythbusters t-shirt” in the first selfie.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

 Professors across Harvard praised University President Drew G. Faust as she announced Wednesday that she plans to step down next year, ending her tenure in good graces that strike a contrast with the acrimonious end to the presidency of her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers.
While Faculty members are scattered across the globe for academic research and summer breaks, their absence from campus did not diminish their support for Harvard’s first female president.
For English Department Chair James Simpson, Faust’s ardent advocacy of the arts and humanities was commendable.
“Drew Faust has been a great President: Olympian, majestic, yet democratic, optimistic and above all meritocratic,” Simpson wrote in an emailed statement. “To work with her is to be inspired to serve the university as a whole.”
Beyond academic support, Faust received near-universal praise from Faculty members for her success in raising over $8 billion in Harvard’s historic capital campaign.
“I was very sad yesterday to read the news,” Human and Evolutionary Biology professor and Faculty Council member Daniel E. Lieberman ’86 wrote in an emailed statement from Kenya. “Despite the many financial challenges the University has faced, President Faust managed to achieve a great deal, especially the campaign, and she guided the University in a steady, thoughtful, and principled way.”
Faust’s rave reviews from Faculty come after an often tense and vitriolic period of conflict between former University President Lawrence H. Summers and Harvard’s professors. Summers resigned in 2006 due to a “clear sense of hostility” between him and FAS. Faust’s relationship with Harvard’s “sleeping giant” has been comparatively jovial.
“President Faust's exceptional leadership has strengthened every part of this institution and positioned Harvard well for the rapidly developing challenges and opportunities of our time,” Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith said in a statement. “I cannot overstate the gratitude I feel for her efforts to create an unparalleled learning environment for our undergraduate and graduate students and an intellectually generative environment for our faculty and staff.”
While Faust’s decade-long relationship with FAS was undoubtedly less controversial than that of her predecessor, recent years have seen tensions between the body and Massachusetts Hall increase over a 2013 email search scandal and most notably, the controversial single-gender social organization sanctions.
But those who have disagreed with Faust’s policies remained muted following Wednesday’s announcement. Some Faculty detractors on the controversial single-gender social organization policy like former Dean of the College, Harry R. Lewis ’68 and biology professor David A. Haig declined to comment.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Faust’s ally in the implementation of the sanctions, applauded Faust for her “globally respected” tenure.
“For the past decade, Harvard University is fortunate to have been stewarded by such an innovative, forward-thinking leader,” Khurana said in a statement. “From a personal perspective, she has been a role model of kindness, thoughtfulness and integrity. I am a better person for having worked with her, and I look forward to working with her in the coming year."
According to to History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93, professors have not been further notified about the impending search committee or any potential successors.
“Drew’s been there for a decade and she’s done great work at the university and I’m sure is eager to hand over the reigns of a strong and stable university to her successor,” McCarthy said. “My hope is that the powers that be who make the decision about who a successor can be will continue to prioritize the breaking of barriers and shattering of glass ceilings.”
Faust will resign the office of University President on June 30, 2018. The Harvard Corporation is tasked with naming her successor.
“She’ll be a tough act to follow,” Lieberman wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scott Flanary, a 2010 graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, won “The Amazing Race” and a $1 million prize, the show revealed in its season finale earlier this month.
In June of 2016, Scott Flanary began his adventure as a contestant on the CBS reality series that sends teams of two to samba in the streets of Brazil, defeat professional gamers in South Korea, and perform a host of other physical and mental challenges.
Unlike in previous years where teams were comprised of contestants who already knew each other, last season—the 29th—featured 22 strangers split into 11 teams. Flanary won with Brooke Camhi, a contestant with whom he partnered on the show.
Flanary said he has watched every episode as a “superfan” since the show began in 2001 and has always wanted to compete. He was selected in May 2016, a month before the race began.
Besides his immediate family and his boss, Flanary did not tell others why he left home for a month. It was not until February of this year, when CBS announced the cast, that he could openly discuss his experiences.
Still, he decided not to spoil the show for his family and friends, and enjoyed seeing their reactions to each episode. “I wanted to live this experience of living it out week to week with the people that I loved. And I think they enjoyed better, because there was that sense of ambiguity, an uneasiness about how far I’d make it,” he said.
Flanary said his background as a recruiter was helpful for forming relationships with other contestants—a key component of his game strategy.
However, he found navigating partner dynamics to be difficult, especially because he and Camhi were strangers. “It was two alpha, type-A personalities trying to get a point across,” he said.
Flanaray said his parents used to ask, “What would you not do for a million dollars?”
“One of the things I always said was ‘I will never bungee jump—it scares me to death.’ And that the only time that I will ever bungee jump in my life is if I’m on ‘The Amazing Race,’” he said.
Nine countries later, Flanary had faced his greatest fear—in Greece, off a 240 feet ledge—and walked away with prize money sufficient to pay off his Harvard loans and cover the down payment of a house.
“The goal of not only being on the race but winning it was something I’ve had on my life bucket list for 15 years,” he said. “It seemed so unattainable before, and now it’s gone.”
