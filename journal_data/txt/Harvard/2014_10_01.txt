“A New Testament” completely renounces Christopher Owens’s previous image. The eccentric Owens, lead singer of the now-disbanded Girls, always seemed uncomfortable in his hipness and the indie scene. Perhaps the cover of the album best explains the spirit it embodies. On it, Owens stands center stage, hand on his red cowboy hat, surrounded by his supporting musicians. There is a lack of stylizing, not in a minimalist way, but in a way that makes the cover look like a poster for some low-budget reality show. Commenting on its design, Owens told SubTV, “It’s very anti-cool; I don’t know any of my peers that would do an album cover that simple.”
From the first bouncy strums of “My Troubled Heart,” the opening track on the album, it is clear this album is a departure from Girls’s standard indie surf-rock record. Owens goes above and beyond the standard of his peers in the male indie scene, where a particularly good voice is not expected, and demonstrates considerable vocal prowess and dexterity. He sings in many styles, from the breathy, soft beginning of “Overcoming Me” to the deep twang of “My Troubled Heart.” His voice ranges from very high vibrato in “Oh My Love” to low and steady in “It Comes Back to You.” Owens has the ability to adapt his voice to indie rock, country, and gospel, and he conveys emotion masterfully through his vocals.
The album is highly personal, much like his debut solo album, “Lysandre.” Owens is very transparent about the issues in his life through his songwriting. The autobiographical “Stephen” mourns the loss of his brother, who died of pneumonia in his infancy, and mentions both his father’s absence and his background growing up in the cult Children of God. Many of the songs also deal with love and heartbreak. They are from various stages of a relationship—“Overcoming Me” recounts the hopeful feeling at the beginning of a new love, “Never Wanna See That Look Again” is an apology, and “Nobody’s Business” is a simple song of being happily in love. Even in his romantic songs, however, he addresses profound family problems—“Mama didn’t raise no quitter, and I wanna make my daddy proud,” he sings on the breakup song “I Just Can’t Live without You.”
Though the album recounts many individual vignettes from Owens’s life, it does not paint a cohesive picture. There is no chronological or thematic order to the album. For example, it jumps from the anguished “Never Want to See That Look Again” to the optimistic “Overcoming Me.” This disjointedness prevents the album from living up to its potential. While “Lysandre” was a concept album with a recurring musical theme, “A New Testament” is simply a collection of songs Owens has been meaning to release for years.
Despite this, the album’s strength lies in the ambitious embrace of a huge variety of styles. The songs mostly have a melange of country and indie influence, but various other genres come through as well. Girls’s discography was dominated by indie surf rock, but both of Owens’s solo works go beyond this. Owens’s vocals on “My Troubled Heart” are reminiscent of Johnny Cash’s. This ’50s and early ’60s country vibe is a common thread through the album. In addition to this, “Stephen” reflects a heavy gospel inspiration. The song starts off with layered, harmonized voices, and the lyrics reflect religious themes. “Nobody’s Business” is a guitar-driven, happy, bursting song in the vein of the early Beatles, and “Never Want to See That Look Again” feels more like Girls’s trademark indie rock than the rest of the album. There is a hard strum between each line of the chorus and a pounding drum, recalling the power-ballads of the ’80s with its swelling instrumentation.
Though “A New Testament” is his second solo album, the songs on it were written throughout his career. Owens has been empowered by his transition from a fairly straightforward indie surf-rock, Coachella-playing band to a more experimental solo career that shares the eclecticness of his musical talent. “There’s nothing unique about this [album],” he told SubTV, laughing, but this is clearly not true. A New Testament spans an impressive number of genres and time periods and is a decidedly individual collection of music. No longer constrained by the structure of a band and able to hire a wide range of supporting musicians, Owens is at his most free on this album.

“How Many” is best described as Iceage’s three-minute catharsis. The Danish punk band’s last album was released in 2013, and in the year since, it seems they’ve reached an intolerable level of fury that’s itching to be released on their upcoming album, “Plowing into the Field of Love.”
In “How Many,” lead singer Elias Bender Rønnenfelt confronts the listener with a wave of frustration, releasing his vocals in near-screams. “Rubbing my perspiring hands…trapped in my body,” Rønnenfelt repents, making it clear that he’s angry and that he’s been waiting for a long time to tell us why. He’s restless: fed up with wasted drunken nights, unable to reach his “utopia,” dying to move on to something new. “How many more days of disorder?” he demands to know before moving on to the next item on his list of grievances. Ronnenfelt holds nothing back, letting us hear every crackle and breath of his screams.
While Rønnenfelt’s vocals remain passionate and engaging throughout the song, the track’s instrumentation seemed generic. The cacophony of winding guitars and repetitive drums drags on behind the lyrics, giving the track a tired quality reminiscent of earlier Iceage songs.
But just as it feels as though Iceage has finally worn itself out, Rønnenfelt gives one final shout of “How many?” and the guitars launch into another round of crashing chords. The band is back at it, drawing from a seemingly endless stream of disillusionment and agitation. Iceage’s pent-up frustration is very good news for the listener—judging by “How Many,” there will be plenty of energetic angst to fuel their upcoming album.
“Plowing Into the Field of Love” is out Oct. 6 via Matador.

When Radiohead introduced their debut album, 1993’s “Pablo Honey,” the whole world was stunned by a completely new take on psychedelic rock. But today, their past originality is often used as a reason to forgive musical stagnation. Admittedly, Thom Yorke and his band have been experimenting with some new possibilities, especially on 2011’s “The King of Limbs” and 2006’s “The Eraser,” but on both of these releases, they still failed to overhaul the “Radiohead sound.”
“Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes” continues Thom Yorke’s search for a transformation, but this time, he is braver than ever. With the total abandonment of guitar, the addition of repetitive and pulsing synths, and a new, emotionally reserved sound, Yorke presents his most minimalistic and contemplative work yet.
The introduction of these new elements suggests why “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes” has to be a solo album—without his other band members, Yorke is free to distance himself from the band’s established sound and sit in front of the computer with Radiohead’s longtime producer Nigel Godrich. Most of the instrumentation on Yorke’s new album consists only of three parts: loops, echos, and ambience. The departure from guitar-driven rock is reminiscent of Keane’s transition to piano-led rock; and just like his guitarless compatriots, Yorke becomes free to create a fresh, futuristic sound. On “Interference,” for example, the mix of keyboard and synthesizer gives rise to not only a new harmony but also a digitized sound world. This transformation manages to retain Radiohead’s psychedelic roots while remaining refreshing to even the most dedicated fans of the band.
Also new to Yorke is the extensive use of loops on “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes.” Although the use of loops themselves is far from innovative, the transition to cyclic synths works perfectly with Yorke’s search for a mesmerizing sound. This is best represented by “Truth Ray,” where Yorke’s vocals and the ambience that surrounds it echo hypnotically in different channels, giving the haunting illusion of a song played endlessly in outer space. Similar repetition is used effectively in “Guess Again!,” “There Is No Ice (for My Drink),” and many of the other tracks on the album to create a sense of stasis. “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes” is not an album that builds and accumulates momentum; rather, it is one that remains static and otherworldly from the first minute to the last.
Yorke also departs from the characteristic tone he employed on his earlier releases with Radiohead. Instead of his trademark longing murmurs, he refines a more distant sound that continues the experiment he began in “The Eraser.” But on “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes,” this sound is much more developed and also made more effective by the surrounding instrumentation, creating the dystopian sound world that defines the album. On the closing track, “Nose Grows Some,” the alienation of Yorke’s vocals is even more amplified by heavy reverberation and becomes an organic, shifting component of the melancholic atmosphere. Together with tracks like “Interference” and “Guess Again!,” “Nose Grows Some” raises Thom Yorke to a new level—one on which he is more detached, more mature, and a true master of his craft.
Despite the excitement that surrounded the sudden unveiling of his latest solo album, Yorke’s bizarre release of “Tomorrow's Modern Boxes” is actually not as interesting as the music itself. After Beyoncé dropped an album out of nowhere at the end of 2013 and U2 shamelessly distributed an album to everyone’s iTunes library, Thom Yorke’s collaboration with BitTorrent doesn’t sound like a big deal. In fact, it gives the impression that the Radiohead frontman is desperate for attention and knows that the songs themselves are unable to draw it. However, this is far from the truth. Indeed, none of the tracks on “Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes” are as revolutionary as “Creep” or “Let Down,” but at the very least, Yorke’s latest marks a very difficult step forward for an extremely accomplished musician.

“I love myself,” sings Kendrick Lamar on his newest single, and if you didn’t already feel the same way about hip-hop’s rising star, then “i” might be just the track to change your mind.
The infectious, uplifting single is the first solo music Kendrick has released since his celebrated 2012 album, “good Kid, m.A.A.d. City.” The track’s unrelenting exuberance is a deviation from K. Dot’s typically dark tone. On his breakthrough album, Lamar impressed critics with his ability to rap about weighty issues in a way that didn’t scare mainstream listeners away. He led his audience through Compton’s harrowing streets, each track a moving and powerfully descriptive narrative.
“i,” in contrast, is far more radio-friendly. The track boasts a funky, upbeat rhythm, a sample of the Isley Brother’s R&B hit “Who’s That Lady,” and a catchy, life-affirming chorus. Although the intro proclaims that Kendrick is “not a rapper, he's a writer, he's an author,” the song doesn’t demonstrate Kendrick’s narrative prowess to the extent of his past work. It does, however, evidence Kendrick’s versatility.
Some may accuse “i” of catering to the mainstream with its easy listenability and feel-good lyrics, but his message is not really so easy and light-hearted as it might initially seem. Though the lyrics have a message of resounding positivity, it is positivity in the face of a dark world. Kendrick’s lyrics—“They wanna say there's a war outside and a bomb in the street / And a gun in the hood and a mob of police”—recall the recent violence in Ferguson, and his message of self-love in a world that does not love you back feels powerful, perhaps even a bit subversive, but definitely not clichéd.
Loving yourself might be difficult at times. Loving Kendrick’s new single doesn’t have to be.
Lamar’s as-yet-unnamed album has no definite release date but is set for release later this year.

Whenever I flip through a magazine, go shopping, or scroll through post-Fashion Week photos on the internet, I find myself inundated with images of beautiful clothing worn by equally beautiful women. Some are doll-faced, like the doe-eyed Edie Campbell; others are glamorous, like the appropriately named Arizona Muse. Some possess an unconventional sort of allure—Daphne Groeneveld's full lips and gap-toothed smile, for example, hold particular sway over the fashion world. But all have one commonality: 34-24-34, the bust, waist, and hip measurements of female runway models all around the world.
The topic of weight and body image in fashion is a commonly discussed one, and it is no secret that the above measurements indicate, for women who are often upwards of 5'9" in height, an alarmingly low body mass index and weight—sometimes fatally so. The death of model Luisel Ramos during Montevideo Fashion Week from heart failure due to anorexia nervosa brought the issue to the spotlight in 2006, while the passing of her sister Eliana Ramos, also a model, allegedly from the same cause just six months later catapulted the controversy to a fever pitch.
So why do the slender waifs of the catwalk march on—why does the fashion industry continue to insist that their models be so thin? According to stylist David Zyla in an interview with Fox News, the decision is made out of deference to the artistic vision of the designer. "Models… are typically slim and androgynous so that audiences are not distracted [from the clothing] by a curvy hip or full bosom," he said. Kate Dillon, who has worked in the fashion industry as both a standard and plus-sized model, offered a similar rationale, telling the Huffington Post, "You want it to be about the clothes, so it's customary that you want the model to disappear. A lot of times they try to asexualize [her] to a hanger."
While casting decisions may be made to best display the artistic merits of these sartorial creations, fashion’s unique status as a mass-consumed form of popular art means that designers also hold a certain responsibility to the public. Aesthetic vision must sometimes give way to reality, because fashion does not exist in a vacuum; it exists within the confines of a very real, very impressionable society. Not only does the model feel that she must quite literally disappear behind the yards of cloth that drape her bony frame, but the hundreds of thousands of young women watching her totter down the runway also admire her beauty and feel that somehow, through any methods possible, they must make themselves look the same.
Indeed, studies compiled by the NYC Girls Project indicate that in America, 60 percent of girls compare their own bodies to those of fashion models, while 48 percent of girls aspire to models' particular brand of thinness. Their resulting dissatisfaction with their own bodies may contribute, in more extreme cases, to the ten million of women who suffer from anorexia or bulimia in their lifetime, and perhaps even the 7.9 percent of sufferers who die from one of the two disorders according to CNN and the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders.
Their attempts to emulate these tall, slim figures are, grim as it may seem, often in vain. Though some models do subsist on little more than lettuce and water, or the famous combination of cigarettes and Diet Coke, they are likely also gifted with a genetic predisposition to be slender. And even if a member of the plebeian masses manages to whittle herself down to a single-digit body fat percentage, modeling agencies are not only seeking thinness; they are holding as their standard a highly specific body measurement ratio from which the vast majority of women deviate in some form or other. Women are not one-size-fits-all, and for many, no amount of lettuce can bring about the coveted 34-24-34. Yet the pursuit of this unattainable ideal is precisely the factor that drives women to extremes of dietary restriction and leads, eventually, to health concerns or even deaths like those of the Ramos sisters.
These issues are, of course, not due to the influence of fashion alone, but the industry does bear a particular onus for its ability to set the aesthetic ideals of our time. Ought we to know better, regardless? Perhaps. A generation should not crucify itself for some arbitrarily determined standard of beauty, but as we watch model after emaciated model strut down the catwalk, ours is damn well trying.
The clock ticks by. Stomachs growl. We hold our appetites.
After all, we are dying to be beautiful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From what I understood—from helping Sarah clean out the fridge after the condolence casseroles friends and neighbors had brought had spoiled, from helping Jake carry some of Isaac’s things down to the basement, from watching them talk to each other like a tremendous wind roped all their words away—I was less surprised that Sarah had asked me to take this trip with her than I was with where she said the trip would be taking us. I asked if she had talked to Jake about this.
“He has his work,” she said. We were sitting at her kitchen table with two untouched glasses of iced tea. Sarah dragged a finger through the water pooled under them. “He won’t miss me.”
“You could find a job,” I said. The line of her jaw sharpened as she clenched her teeth. “Maybe not in pharmaceuticals, but you have your degree. You could get one.”
“I haven’t worked in almost seven years.” She looked around the kitchen like she was memorizing the sheen of every surface, each droplet of grease on the walls. “Unless you’d count taking care of him as work.”
I’d put my hand on her leg then, as I did now. “You were a good mother,” I’d said then, as I did now. Back in her kitchen, she had jerked herself away from me, but here in the car, her right foot still toeing the gas down, she said, “Let’s not talk about him, please. Something else. Tell me about another road trip you went on.”
“The time we drove up to Montreal?”
“No, something I wasn’t part of. Something I don’t already know about.”
I tilted my head to the window, flattening my ear there. The curvature of the highway hummed into my skin.
My family didn’t vacation often, but the summer I was 13 my father drove my brother, my mother, and me from New Jersey to Disney World in one of his efforts to make her love us more. He split the journey into two days, stopping at a motel in South Carolina for a night, instructing my brother and me to wait in the car until he had obtained the room key so the receptionist wouldn’t discover we were splitting a king-sized bed between four people.
As soon as we unbolted the door to our room in that motel, all four of us collapsed into bed, energy husked by the 11-hour drive. I was the first to wake a few hours later. We had forgotten to turn the lights off. Our shoes were on the carpet like a handful of seeds, and my father was still wearing his glasses. My mother slept actively, the same concise line between her eyebrows she always wore in the day. I knew they would awaken in an hour and take turns showering, the three of us creeping around my mother, dreading the inevitable snap of her voice. I knew that tomorrow she would pin the griminess of our Orlando hotel, its two roaches scuttling across the baseboard, on my father and not be appeased until she herself had talked to the manager, hissing that he could never do things right—I knew all I would remember of the next four days would be my mother’s refusal to go on any rides and eventually her refusal to leave the hotel because it was too hot and too sunny and she didn’t want to darken her skin—but in that motel at 1 a.m., I looked at the three of them, the four of us, and thought, “We are all just a series of breaths.” And I went back to sleep.
I told some of this to Sarah. She smiled and said, “I like that, Rachel. We’re all just a series of breaths.”
Pausing, she glanced into the mirror to change lanes. Then she said, “But is that it? It’s just the physical, and the mental and emotional has no bearing on who we are?”
I sighed as the car glided into the adjacent lane, a silver sedan passing so quickly on our left that Sarah’s car rocked in response.
“Looks like someone’s in a hurry,” I said, trying to keep my voice buoyant. When Sarah didn’t answer I sighed again, said, “It was just a thought I had when I was 13. I don’t know if I believe it now—I don’t know if I believed it back then.”
Silence for the stretch between two exits. Ohio at this speed seemed a glance of a green bird’s wing. Signs for Indiana now were becoming more frequent, and I was counting the breaths until we would enter. We were five miles from the border when she spoke again. She said, “I wonder what Jake would say if I told him that. I can just imagine how that conversation would go.” The leather of the armrest crackled as she sunk her elbow farther in. “‘What are you trying to say, Sarah? We’re only a product of our physical makeup? You know Isaac was more than just his autism.’”
“Jake wouldn’t say that,” I interrupted.
“Maybe not. But he’d be thinking it, or something like it.”
“No he wouldn’t. Sarah—we know Jake. He’s always stood with you, through everything, and he’ll be with you through this too.” The highway barrier undulated in my vision. “And so will I, if you need me.”
She said nothing. I held my breath. We crossed the border.

There were a lot of things to admire about the ’70s-themed soundtrack to “Guardians of the Galaxy.” It had David Bowie. It had the Raspberries. It had the Runaways. But most importantly, it had Blue Swede. We can’t help thinking that this Swedish group’s inimitable cover of B.J. Thomas’s “Hooked On a Feeling” could have brightened up more than a few of the past year’s films. Read on for our list and be sure to click on the films' names.
MAGIC IN THE MOONLIGHT
Sure, this was set in the 1920s, but it’s all too easy to get tired of the jazz Woody Allen always puts on his soundtrack. “Hooked On a Feeling,” on the other hand—can anyone get tired of this song?
BOYHOOD
This was widely acclaimed for its nostalgia-inducing soundtrack, but we’re unsure why everyone was so nostalgic for Coldplay’s “Yellow” and Sheryl Crow’s “Soak Up the Sun.” Want a song you can get nostalgic about? Try “Hooked On a Feeling.”
INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS
Maybe if Oscar Isaac’s moody folk-singer had more songs like “Hooked On a Feeling,” this movie would have a happy ending.
LET’S BE COPS
This ill-timed police comedy (four days after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.) scored a 20 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. With “Hooked On a Feeling,” we’re sure it would have scored at least 21 percent.
CHEFWhat key ingredient was missing from this culinary comedy? You guessed it: “Hooked On a Feeling.”
AMERICAN HUSTLE
Yes, this movie had a soundtrack exclusively composed of hits from the 1970s. But it didn’t have “Hooked On a Feeling.”

Until three months ago, I did not believe in democracy.
Being from Hong Kong, I always appreciated the efficiency and perks of a large civil service and government unencumbered by all the fuss associated with the election cycle. I held a large degree of respect for the Hong Kong government’s ability to provide cheap, modern health care, subsidized public housing, and excellent public transportation. I held the same mentality that many people from my city still do—that the democratic movement in Hong Kong was unnecessary because our city functioned perfectly well without it. When I first came to Harvard, I would scoff in my Gov. 20 section at idealistic students who wholeheartedly embraced democratization and laugh when my friends from the U.S. discussed government shutdowns and congressional gridlock. I genuinely believed that democracy was not for everyone, and it was certainly not needed in my hometown.
Despite disturbing trends, I firmly clung onto this belief. My earliest memory was watching the handover of Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese government on the television in 1997. I could not fully comprehend the significance of the event, but I remember feeling hopeful about the future of our city. I also remember feeling angry about Article 23, a proposed national security law that would have restricted freedom of speech and imposed maximum life sentences for sedition against the Chinese government, an anger shared by the hundreds of thousands of protestors who took to the streets in 2003. And I remember thinking that the People’s Congress 2007 vote to rule out the possibility of democratic elections in Hong Kong until 2017 was condescending to the Hong Kong people.
Nonetheless, I toed the traditional line that we did not need democracy to be a successful city. I was aware that the Hong Kong government was neither perfect nor responsive to Hong Kong’s poor. But the “one country, two systems” framework and the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution drawn up by the Chinese and the British) provided the means for Hong Kong residents to enjoy freedom of speech and political participation without wading into the murkiness of democratic elections.
But my views have radically shifted in the past three months. In June, I was outraged when the Chinese government released a white paper asserting its “comprehensive authority” over Hong Kong and our city’s judicial system, which stood at clear tension with the Basic Law. I was infuriated when the National People’s Congress Standing Committee ruled that although every Hong Kong resident could vote in the chief executive election, candidates had to be chosen by a selection committee, guaranteeing that only pro-Beijing candidates will be nominated—ergo, our election process would be akin to that of Iran’s approval of presidential candidates by a theocratic Guardian Council. This prompted me to completely reevaluate my faith in our government and to finally understand why Hong Kong not only deserved, but needed democracy.
In protest against Beijing’s decision, thousands of university and high school students went on strike last week. After being on the receiving end of heavy-handed treatment by the police, the students were joined by the larger, pro-democracy Occupy Central movement on Sunday. In response to an entirely peaceful demonstration, the police attacked protesters with pepper spray and tear gas. This only caused the protest to swell, not dwindle, and over 50,000 protestors donned goggles, cling film, and rain coats and used umbrellas to deflect the worst of the gas and the spray. I am so proud of all the protesters who demonstrated such remarkable tenacity in the face of police brutality. Two of my pre-med friends refused to leave first-aid tents for 12 hours to provide medical help to injured protesters. Meanwhile, the very active Hong Kongers studying abroad have helped mobilize events at their colleges worldwide to raise awareness and focus international scrutiny on Hong Kong and pressure the government to cease its unjustified crackdown on a peaceful protest.
So why should you care about Hong Kong? First, our city’s turbulent history and recent events are a strong lesson in why you cannot take free elections and democracy for granted. Hong Kongers are willing to take pepper spray in the face from riot police to take a stand on democracy. Photos of the battleground that Hong Kong has turned into should prompt you to contemplate what you would do to defend your freedom. Second, the Hong Kong people have set an example for all that you can and should stand up for your freedom in the face of a powerful, authoritarian government which could put its foot down at the drop of a hat. This dedication and bravery should be cherished and celebrated. And third, you should care because no one will help Hong Kong. The United Kingdom would be the country with the most legitimacy to step in and intervene on our behalf, since China’s actions violate the principles of the 1997 Sino-British Declaration. But judging by the U.K.’s silence on the issue so far, it is clear that international awareness is the only tool we have to pressure the Hong Kong government into taking a stand on behalf of the Hong Kong people for once and not merely kowtow to the wishes of the Communist Party of China.
In a 1984 speech, Deng Xiaoping said, “We are convinced that the people of Hong Kong are capable of running the affairs of Hong Kong well, and we want to see an end to foreign rule. The people of Hong Kong themselves will agree to nothing less.” After a century of colonial rule, the people of Hong Kong deserve better than the farce proposed by Beijing.

You may notice an unusual influx of yellow in people’s wardrobes today. This isn’t a simple fashion statement—it is part of an international movement to express solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The movement deserves our support, and China should be criticized for its behavior toward civil rights both in Hong Kong and on the mainland.
The protests were sparked in opposition to voting reforms proposed by the Chinese legislature in August that would require a special committee to approve all candidates for chief executive of Hong Kong in the coming 2017 election. The committee will be comprised of pro-Beijing supporters, and it is widely believed that the committee’s purpose is to root out candidates whose progressive politics would oppose Beijing’s interests. Protestors—mainly students—took to the streets this weekend in what has been lauded as a universally peaceful movement.
The same praise cannot be directed at the Chinese government. At every step of the way, the government has behaved in ways that are anathema to civil rights. In Hong Kong, riot police sprayed tear gas and pepper spray on unarmed protestors. In mainland China, the government recently blocked access to social media services Instagram and Weibo in what appears to be an effort to contain the pro-democracy movement to Hong Kong.
Similar conduct toward civil liberties has been the norm in mainland China for years. China operates under a one-party government, with the Communist Party playing the leading role. Activists who criticize the system and the Communist Party are regularly silenced. Just this month, a university professor protesting the treatment of the Uighurs in China was sentenced to life in prison. The so-called “Great Firewall of China” blocks access to many popular social media and news websites, and has caused companies such as Google to pull out of mainland China due to ethical qualms.
Comparatively, Hong Kong, while governed by the China, has been relatively lucky. The former British colony has—up until this point—retained many traditionally “Western-style” freedoms under the so-called “one country, two systems” arrangement.
Hong Kong’s recent situation has garnered much more Western attention, perhaps due to its large expatriate population, and its place as a financial hub in Asia. Hopefully, this situation will make people notice the rights abuses on the mainland as well as in Hong Kong—all such abuses are an outrage against all people.
Unfortunately, foreign governments have been slow to condemn Beijing’s actions. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong released a halfhearted statement on Monday refusing to “take sides” on the issue. Later, the White House took a slightly more critical stance of China, expressing solidarity with the “aspiration of the Hong Kong people.” While such statements are a good start, foreign governments should more strongly oppose of the situation in Hong Kong and the continued human rights abuses under the Beijing regime.
Luckily, where governments have been too cautious to make noise, college students have stepped in. The “Wear Yellow for Hong Kong” movement—organized by Crimson editorial writer Heather L. Pickerell ‘15—has drawn thousands of supporters from universities across the country.
It’s time for the world to stop ignoring China’s abhorrent human rights record. China’s GDP is no excuse for its government’s continuous infringement on its citizens’ rights. The people of Hong Kong deserve a voice, both in the streets and in the ballot box.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first lecture of his introductory economics course, professor N. Gregory Mankiw claimed that one of the three reasons you should take his class is “to get rich.”
Mankiw’s course boasts an enrollment of 711 students.
Over the past few years, countless studies and articles have been published trying to determine whether or not college provides a worthy, concrete, monetary return on investment. Many prominent magazines and intellectual thinkers have come to the same conclusion: College is often a waste of money.
But at Harvard—where the two most popular classes are introductory courses in economics and computer science, and the average alum makes over $120,000 annually by the middle of her career—we should be asking the opposite question: Does Harvard do anything but prepare students financially?
Harvard clearly and effectively combats the idea that a college education (at least one at Harvard) harms one’s economic prospects. Even Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, who famously argues that higher education is a bubble, agrees that the few schools with brands like Harvard offer “insurance they don’t offer anywhere else.” And this would all be fine if Harvard did not claim to be something more.
But it does.
In my first week here, I attended a mandatory community discussion on “why liberal education matters,” listened to a convocation speech from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on making sure that Harvard freshmen do not focus “on the material goal,” and heard from parents, professors, and administrators alike that college is a time to explore—that I should not yet know what I am going to concentrate in or what classes I want to take.
But in spite of the fact that Harvard seemingly goes out of its way to foster an environment in which students pursue the academic areas that interest them—and in spite of the fact that Harvard is one of the only schools in the country where even skeptics like Peter Thiel remain confident students will make back the money they invest in their education, regardless of major—the classes Harvard freshmen choose to take, by and large, are ones that follow a path to Wall Street or Silicon Valley.
There are several reasonable explanations for the dissonance between Harvard’s students and faculty on the merit of a liberal arts education. Perhaps Harvard students genuinely fear they will be unable to support their families with a degree in the humanities (having failed to account for the fact that a degree at Harvard, unlike one from most schools, is almost always going to be cost effective). It is also entirely possible that students at Harvard are just more interested in mathematical subjects like economics or computer science than they are with the arts. Or, more ominously, the type of students Harvard attracts these days are the success-driven, results-oriented machines so-often mocked by critics of the cutthroat Ivy League application process, and to those students, economics and computer science seem like logical next steps in a calculated approach to schooling.
Regardless of the reasoning, these students are missing out.
At Harvard—where future economic security is not much of a question—college can and should be much more than a stepping stone to the workplace. Instead, college should be a time when students grow up: try new things, gain independence, and come into contact with people from all over the world.
As Steve Jobs, who credits a calligraphy class with his inspiration for bringing personal computers “multiple typefaces [and] proportionally spaced fonts,” said, “You cannot connect the dots looking forward… You can only connect them looking backwards.”
Peter Thiel probably did not imagine that majoring in 20th century philosophy in college would set him up to be a billionaire.  Lloyd Blankfein ’75 concentrated in government on his way to law school—not something that usually results in becoming the CEO of Goldman Sachs. And Mitt Romney’s English major at BYU did not exactly have CEO of Bain Capital or governor of Massachusetts written all over it.
All this to say: do not start connecting the dots as a freshman. Take classes because they are enriching and stimulate your mind. And then, after exploring these classes—engaging in topics that interest you, taking risks, following your passions—maybe you’ll decide to set foot in Mankiw’s class, because what you really want is to “get rich” after all. And, hey, with classes in a wide-range of subjects under your belt, you’ll be even better equipped to do just that.

UPDATED: Sept. 30, 2014, at 11:49 p.m.
BOSTON—Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officials unveiled Tuesday afternoon preliminary plans to build a new $25 million commuter rail station on Harvard-owned property in Allston and announced that the University has agreed to cover one third of the cost.
Currently dubbed “West Station,” the project will connect Allston to the existing Framingham/Worcester commuter rail line, which originates at South Station. It will also include an MBTA layover and maintenance facility.
The news was delivered during a rainy ceremony at the University-owned Beacon Park Rail Yard, where the new station and associated infrastructure will be located. It comes as the Massachusetts Department of Transportation begins its $260 million realignment of the adjacent Massachusetts Turnpike, which aims to reroute the highway above the rail yard.
Harvard bought the 91-acre parcel where both developments will take place from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in 2003. It lies south of Cambridge Street and the majority of Harvard’s Allston interests. Most of the property currently consists of rails used by the MBTA and formerly used by the private railroad company CSX.
CSX moved most of its operations to Westborough and Worcester last year, freeing up a large part of the property and spurring the announcement of the realignment project in October 2013. Under current plans, the realignment would potentially free up dozens of acres of Harvard property for development.
The West Station news drew praise from Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh, who spoke on Tuesday of the West Station project’s power to transform the Allston community, a goal that they emphasized Harvard shares with the City and the community.
“This is much more than a highway project; it is a connection for the community,” Walsh said, speaking to a small crowd of onlookers in the rain from a MBTA commuter rail train. “The investment made by Harvard, by the governor, and by the community is outstanding.”
Plans for a potential West Station have been floated for years, but earlier this spring, MassDOT officials had said there was not enough funding for the project to be undertaken alongside the realignment. That changed, officials said, due to community demand voiced by a 49-person task force of Allstonians.
Officials at a Sept. 18 Allston community meeting about the realignment project stressed that West Station will not include large parking lots for those driving into Boston, as it is meant for neighborhood use and in particular the many college students living in Allston and Brighton during the school year.
At the rail yard event Tuesday, MassDOT Secretary Richard A. Davey explicitly thanked University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp for her help in securing the preliminary commitment from Harvard. Lapp was invited to speak at the event but declined.
Davey noted that the Massachusetts state government will also contribute a third of the funds for the station. MassDOT has yet to find a source for a third of the funding. Toll revenue from the Turnpike, meanwhile, will fund the larger realignment project, according to MassDOT officials.
Other speakers at the event included elected leaders of many levels, including Allston’s State Senator William N. Brownsberger and State Representative Kevin G. Honan.
MBTA expects a contract for West Station to be awarded in 2017, the same year that construction is slated to begin on the Turnpike realignment, a three-year project.

Bashar Masri, founder and CEO of Massar International, spoke about the challenges he has faced while helping lead the creation of Rawabi, the first planned Palestinian city, on Tuesday at the Kennedy School of Government.
Rawabi has been in the making since 2007, when Masri said he first thought of building a planned city in the West Bank. According to its website, Rawabi will initially house about 25,000 residents, with Masri predicting 40,000 or more in another decade. The city is currently uninhabited as planners wait for government approval to use water from a nearby aquifer.
Political turmoil in the region has repeatedly delayed the authorization process, which is one of the last obstacles faced by developers before residents can begin to move in, Masri said.
When first presenting his idea to the executive board of Massar International, Masri said he asked everyone at the table to identify potential obstacles. “We went around the table three or four times, and we wrote down 102 obstacles,” he said, listing problems such as purchasing land, attracting future residents, and finding investors.
However, Masri said most of these issues have been solved over the last seven years. “Today we only have two or three challenges left,” he said, identifying water issues, a single narrow access road, and job creation in a turbulent economy.
Masri, who is Palestinian-American, cited his personal, rather than economic, reasons for building Rawabi.
“This particular project to me is not about money…. [It is] for Palestine, and it is for the Palestinians,” he said. “We never thought of anyone outside of Palestine.”
The event was part of the Belfer Center’s Middle East Initiative speaker series that “exists to bring together leaders in political, civil society, and business fields and create a space for dynamic interaction around issues relating to the Middle East,” MEI events assistant Christopher L. Mawhorter said.
Masri said that Rawabi has become “a showcase for Palestine to show the international community what we can do.” He said that while the project was originally intended as a local endeavor for Palestinians, the positive response from international media has been both surprising and encouraging.
“The world is with us, and they want to see a prosperous Palestinian state,” he said.
Nada Al-Sharif, a member of the audience, said she was pleasantly surprised that the company appeared to be so community-oriented.
“I think that people approached them [with investments], they didn’t approach people,” she said.

Cambridge Police arrested a woman who reportedly stabbed her boyfriend in the Old Burial Ground cemetery following a verbal altercation early Saturday morning.
Revere resident Mariel Teves, 24, was arrested at the scene for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, according to a Cambridge Police Department report. She allegedly stabbed her boyfriend twice in the leg.
Cambridge Police arrived at the cemetery Saturday morning after receiving a call from a witness to find the victim, a 26-year-old from Medford, lying on the ground bleeding. The victim was treated at the scene for non-life threatening injuries and was transported to a local hospital, according to the report.
“[Teves] was distressed at the scene, expressing great concern for the individual,” Cambridge Police spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said. “She expressed some sort of regret.”
Teves was arraigned Monday morning in Cambridge District Court with bail set for $5,000. Neither the assailant nor the victim are affiliated with the University.

The fourth annual President’s Challenge, a University-wide social entrepreneurship competition hosted by the Harvard Innovation Lab, will kick off Monday.
Participants in the 2015 edition of the challenge will be asked to propose feasible and innovative solutions to contemporary problems across five categories: affordable health, connected cities, education innovation, economic development and sustainable employment, and energy and the environment, University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber '76 wrote in an email to the Harvard community last week.
“Harvard is about possibilities,” the administrators’ email read. “Here, it is possible to meet—and to become—the change-makers who are applying knowledge and solving the world’s greatest problems.”
Throughout the fall term, the i-Lab will conduct workshops and networking sessions for contest participants, who will work in teams to create and submit proposals. In the spring, ten finalist teams will receive $5,000 in seed money, along with space in the i-Lab to further develop their ideas. The winners and up to three runners-up, who will be announced in the spring, will share $100,000 in prizes.
I-Lab Managing Director Gordon S. Jones said he views the President’s Challenge as an opportunity for students to collaborate with individuals from a variety of disciplines.
“The purpose of the President’s Challenge is to bring together resources from across the University that help students who have ideas and innovations to develop the skills they would need and access the expertise to grow their ideas,” Jones said.
All teams must include at least one student currently enrolled in one of Harvard’s undergraduate or graduate programs, and participants will be encouraged to network to form teams at upcoming i-Lab workshops.
Last year, more than 130 teams, including more than 300 Harvard students, submitted proposals to the President’s Challenge, Jones said. The 2014 Challenge winner, a team that designed a smartphone-based prognosis test to help diabetic foot ulcers, received a prize of $70,000. The runners-up, which included projects focused on optimizing use of public land, developing telehealth solutions in dentistry, and using technology to reduce school bullying, each received $10,000.
Jones cited Mark43, a team of engineers who created a crime-fighting software designed to protect police officers and communities, as an example of previous Challenge participants who have implemented the ideas they developed during the contest.
The President’s Challenge kick-off event will be held on Monday evening at the i-Lab and will feature a keynote address by Kennedy School of Government Dean David T. Ellwood ’75.

One of several new restaurants in Harvard Square, Kennedy's on the Square opened at its location on 15 Dunster St. this past Friday.
The restaurant shares much in common with the former occupant of the spot, First Printer, including a similar menu as well as the same executive chef and a similar set of staff members, according to Nikki Frankson, a manager at Kennedy’s on the Square.
“The cuisine is 80 percent the same [as First Printer], but we’ve added small plates,” Frankson said, adding that the small plate price point ranges from $12-14.
With new small dishes such as fish tacos, barbecue pork ribs, and grass-fed beef sliders with kimchi ketchup, Kennedy’s has also made several other changes to the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant now features red leather banquettes, a 70-inch television, high tables, and pictures of the Kennedy family.
“I know there’s lots of gastropubs, but this is a really cool space for the Harvard crowd,” Frankson said.
The new restaurant will be open on weekends, with brunch from 10 to 2 p.m., a special late-night menu from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. that features dishes like deviled eggs and loaded french fries, and a bar. During the week, dining will end at 10 p.m.
Calling the turnover “seamless,” Frankson said that the restaurant has been under the same ownership since last November. While the transition began almost seven months ago, she said that delays in the restaurant industry are common.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that Kennedy’s offered improved food options and a change in furniture to make the ambience more comfortable.
“The previous owners had put a lot of money into the bar and into the kitchen and things like venting.... [The new owners] weren’t planning to make huge changes,” Jillson said. “They’re excited about it and so are we.”
Operated by MG Restaurant Group and sporting a 94-seat capacity, according to the restaurant’s website, the new establishment marks another location for the Kennedy’s chain, which already has sites in Norwood, Sharon, and Newton.

Thousands of students around the world have already registered for the first edX courses designed specifically for high school students.
The initiative, which was launched Sept. 9, includes 27 courses that cover primarily Advanced Placement program material and are available for free to anyone who wishes to enroll. The first new course, an edX version of AP Biology, will launch on Oct. 13, while the others will launch shortly after and into 2015.
EdX CEO Anant Agarwal wrote on the platform’s blog that the high school initiative will address what he called a “crucial need”―preparing high schoolers for the coursework they will encounter in college.
“This readiness gap between college eligibility and preparedness is costly not only to students, but also to families and institutions,” he wrote. “Our new initiative will address this severe gap and help alleviate these costly disparities.”
Eleven edX member schools, including MIT and the University of California, Berkeley, now offer high school-oriented MOOCs. Additionally, two American high schools and several other institutions of higher learning will also contribute courses and instructors to the platform. Harvard has not joined the initiative.
“We are interested in high school level courses and there are some initial conversations happening about building suitable content...but nothing is imminent,” HarvardX spokesperson Michael P. Rutter wrote in an email.
According to Teppo Jouttenus, a program manager for edX who oversees the high school initiative, edX began planning the launch of the high school platform in late 2013 and officially moved forward in May 2014 by asking edX members to propose intro-level and high school online courses.
“Even though edX was launched with the focus on college education, it was clear to everyone involved that this really could have potential for all kinds of learning,” Jouttenus said.
Daniel D. Garcia, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley who has adapted one of his college courses into an edX course designed to fulfill requirements for AP Computer Science Principles, said that although the material in his edX is similar to what he offers at Berkeley, necessary changes must be made to accommodate high school learners.
“At ten miles up, time doubles,” said Garcia, who will be taking the year off to focus on developing the course.  “We'll take a one-semester class and when you move it to a high school space, it becomes a one-year course.”
Jouttenus said he believes the new courses will cater to a variety of audiences, including high school students whose teachers may use the edX material as a supplement to their normal class and students from schools that do not offer AP courses.
Jeneen Graham, an AP Psychology teacher from St. Margaret’s Episcopal School in California, agreed and said that students from 45 different countries have already signed up for her new edX course, “Introduction to Psychology.”
“These are often students who don't have access to this kind of material,” Graham said. “This is the first [initiative] of its kind to be speaking to a high-school level student.”

A packed Sanders Theatre rose in standing ovation again and again Tuesday afternoon to honor the eight recipients of this year’s W. E. B. Du Bois Medals.
The recipients—U.S. Congressman John L. Lewis, writer and activist Maya Angelou, architect David Adjaye, artist and activist Harry Belafonte, "12 Years a Slave" filmmaker Steve McQueen, television producer Shonda Rhimes, Miramax founder Harvey Weinstein, and Oprah Winfrey—were recognized for their contributions to African American culture and the “life of the mind.”
The Du Bois Medal, first presented in 2000, is the highest honor awarded by Harvard in the field of African and African American studies.
The event opened with a performance of James Weldon Johnson’s “Lift Every Voice and Sing” by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College. Members of the audience rose during the performance, while some, including Winfrey, sang along.
Winfrey accepted the medal on behalf of her late friend and mentor, Maya Angelou. Angelou, known for her writing and activism, died in May.
“Her greatest lessons were to teach us all how we are more alike than we are different,” Winfrey said.
Shonda Rhimes rose to accept her medal, after an introduction by Lawrence D. Bobo, chair of the African and African American Studies Department, as audience members shouted “We love you Shonda!”
After responding that she loved them too, Rhimes commented on the praise given to her for her realistic representations of diversity on primetime television shows such as "Grey’s Anatomy," "Scandal," and "How to Get Away With Murder."
“I wish it wasn’t so remarkable that I thought that television should look like the rest of the world,” she said.
University Professor William Julius Wilson honored filmmaker Steve McQueen, saying that McQueen has produced “a body of work that allows us to look at and change our perspective,” including "12 Years A Slave" and Hunger. Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. referred to the former movie as “one of the most vivid and authentic portrayals of slavery ever captured in a feature film.”
After an introduction by Diane Paulus '88, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater, Weinstein accepted his award, joking that he can now tell his mother that he got an award at Harvard.
Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 thanked Representative John L. Lewis “for the moral leadership he has offered time and time again.” Lewis is known for his role as the second African American to represent Georgia in Congress since Reconstruction and for his leadership during the civil rights movement.
“When I was growing up in rural Alabama, I saw signs that said ‘white men, colored men, white women, colored women’ and I didn’t like that,” Lewis said. “And my parents told me whenever I asked a question, ‘That’s the way it is, don’t get in their way, don’t get in trouble.’ And I got in trouble. Good trouble. Necessary trouble.”
Graduate School of Design Dean Mohsen Mostafavi lauded David Adjaye for his groundbreaking work in architecture around the world. Adjaye’s newest building is the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is currently under construction on the National Mall in Washington D. C. and is expected to open in 2016.
Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, introduced Harry Belafonte, highlighting his musical contributions and activism. In 1956, Belafonte became the first musical artist to sell more than one million LPs with his album, "Calypso."
“Belafonte has always used his star power to shed light on the plight of the poor, the underserved, and the underrepresented,” Smith said.
Amidst more than 30 seconds of applause, Oprah Winfrey accepted her award from University President Drew G. Faust.
“All of us share the same goal regardless of our professions or what our pathways might be,” Winfrey said. “We all want to live up to be the truest, highest expressions of ourselves as human beings.”

UPDATED: October 1, 2014, at 3:50 p.m.
Christine M. Heenan, Harvard’s vice president for government, community, and public affairs, will depart the University in February for a post at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the University announced today in a press release.
Heenan will become a senior communications advisor to the philanthropic foundation, but will continue to work with Harvard part time through the end of the 2014-2015 academic year.
“President Faust often talks about how Harvard stretches you and changes you,” Heenan said in a press release. “That’s true for students, but it’s also true for staff. It’s certainly true for me.”
Heenan, who came to Harvard in 2008 after working in the private sector and at Brown University, oversaw the University’s lobbying efforts, its community relations, and its growing communications arm, Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. She also taught a freshman seminar on communications and public policy, which she called “one of my best experiences at Harvard.”
Heenan departs in the middle of a multi-year fundraising drive which publicly launched last September with a goal of $6.5 billion. So far, Harvard has raised at least $4.65 billion. Heenan said that she is not at all worried about leaving HPAC even as the campaign moves forward.
“I think the campaign’s success and leadership is really an endorsement of University leadership, and communications is just about more wind in the sails,” she said in an interview on Wednesday in her Massachusetts Hall office. “The main source of wind in the sails is momentum at the University, belief in President Faust’s leadership, a strong development team.”
Details about Heenan’s successor were not disclosed on Wednesday afternoon, but Heenan told The Crimson that she has heard from University President Drew G. Faust that a search will commence soon.
Heenan’s exit represents continued shuffling of Harvard’s top spokespeople after Kevin Galvin, who spent two years as a spokesperson for Faust, departed for a position at Arizona State University this summer. Galvin was replaced by Jeff Neal, who previously worked as a spokesperson for Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. Colin Manning, who also covers Harvard College, now works with Smith on an interim basis as a search for Neal’s permanent succesor continues.
“The nice thing about the level of exposure and stretch that you get working at a place like Harvard is that other people notice,” Heenan said on Wednesday. “It’s great that Kevin [Galvin] was able to ascend to a leadership role at Arizona [State]. And the fact that we were able to transition within with Jeff was also, I think, a commitment we have to promoting from within because we have such strong talent.”
During her roughly seven year stay, Heenan oversaw the centralization of the news and government and community affairs divisions of her branch under one roof, as well as their consistent growth. Under her leadership, HPAC also took a leading role in coordinating the public disclosures of events like the Government 1310 cheating scandal in 2012 and the secret searches of resident dean email accounts by administrators in 2013, but also modernized key areas of its service.
On Wednesday, Heenan pointed to the reorganization of her office as one of her top achievements.
“The integration of public affairs and communications as one cohesive integrated department is something I’m really proud of,” she said. “Building up digital strategy and Harvard’s digital and social channels under [Chief Digital Officer] Perry Hewitt’s leadership has been a big part of how Harvard interacts differently with the world and looks different to the world, that I’m very proud of.”
Today, HPAC is among the largest university communications offices in the country.

Technically, the Harvard field hockey team lost, 4-1, to Penn on Saturday.
Perhaps more precisely, however, the Crimson lost to Penn senior captain Alex Iqbal, who scored her first hat trick of the season off of three identical penalty corners to lift the Quakers to victory at Ellen Vagelos Field in Philadelphia.
Iqbal started the scoring off early, giving Penn a 1-0 lead with her second goal of the season at the 11-minute mark. The senior converted a penalty corner set up by seniors Emily Corcoran and MaryRose Croddick to put the Quakers on the board.
However, it was in the last 10 minutes of the game that Iqbal really took control, taking advantage of two late penalty corners to put Harvard away. With just under seven minutes to play, Iqbal shot from the top of the circle to the right of Crimson goalkeeper Issy Davies to increase Penn’s lead to two goals.
Less than a minute later, Iqbal showed that her first two goals were anything but a fluke, once again converting on a penalty corner set up by Corcoran and Croddick to give Penn an almost-insurmountable 4-1 lead with just over five minutes to play.
Harvard played right with Penn for most of the first half, even taking a 7-6 shots-on-goal advantage into the second period. After Iqbal’s first goal, sophomore Marissa Balleza didn’t take long to even the score, and easily beat the Penn defense and goalkeeper to get her fifth goal of the season on a wide-open net.
But the Crimson’s momentum didn’t last long, as Corcoran scored her team-high eighth goal of the season, unassisted, to finish off the first half. Once again, Harvard was undone by a penalty corner, as Corcoran corralled the rebound after Davies saved Madison Hendry’s shot off of a corner and put it away to give Penn a 2-1 lead heading into halftime.
The second half opened with 25 minutes of scoreless play, as neither team was able to convert on multiple opportunities. Penn senior Allison Weisenfels made two of her five saves early in the second half, turning away shots from both senior Caitlin Rea and Balleza to keep Penn on top.
Penn struggled to put challenging shots on goal for the majority of the second half, but took advantage of the penalty corners late in the game to give Iqbal the hat trick and earn its third straight victory over Harvard. The Quakers led the Crimson in shots, 12-10, but its real advantage came in penalty corners, where Penn earned 10 opportunities to Harvard’s six.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the end of regulation neared last Tuesday night at Soldiers Field, the Harvard men’s soccer team (5-3-0) pounded shot after shot at the Northeastern goal. The Crimson had just dug its way out of a 2-0 hole, but with the score tied, the match appeared set for overtime.
With 43 seconds left in the contest, however, junior defenseman Andrew Chang decided that overtime would not be necessary.
After junior forward Oliver White had a shot deflected inside the box, Chang found the ball 18 yards out and rocketed a volley into the upper right corner of the net, sealing the win.
“After I scored, I just ran over to my teammates and to the bench to celebrate,” Chang said. “It felt pretty good.”
Chang’s goal gave Harvard a winning record for the first time since the beginning of 2011. Little did the defenseman know that it would be just the first of two dramatic comebacks on the week in which he would contribute to the winning goal.
On Friday at Massachusetts, the Crimson faced a 2-0 deficit for the second consecutive match. The Minutemen (1-6-0) had scored twice in the first 16 minutes, but with goals in the 39th and 52nd minutes, Harvard forced its way back once again, sending the match into overtime.
Then in the 91st minute, Chang delivered again, lofting a corner kick to the top of the box in the direction of senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi, who connected on a header and found the back of the net.
“It was just a great play for Andrew,” co-captain Kyle Henderson said. “I kind of had the feeling that it was going to come because [we] were playing at such a high level and creating chances for the team.”
The Crimson’s final breakthrough on Friday came after 32 shots, 20 of which were on goal—part of the offensive onslaught that Chang helped lead out of the back. The score line mirrored the team’s previous match against the Huskies (2-6-0), in which Harvard scored three goals in the final 16 minutes, capped by Chang’s winner.
“The whole team knew we needed to keep fighting,” Chang said. “We believed we could come back and win [both matches]. I think that the challenge was just to keep pushing.”
The Highland Park, Ill., native has taken on a larger leadership role with the Crimson this season, starting in seven of Harvard’s first eight matches. Chang says he has been communicating with his teammates more both off and on the field, particularly during halftime breaks when the team discusses areas to improve in the second half.
“I see my role being a leader as an upperclassman,” Chang said. “I need to continue to be vocal and loud, [while] showing confidence and helping out the underclassmen.”
Despite being listed as a midfielder, Chang has played primarily on the back line this season—the same position he played for the USA U-17 national team in 2009-2010. Among his new responsibilities for the Crimson has been helping to build offense out of the back, as seen in the counter-attack that ended in Chang’s match-winning strike against Northeastern.
“Just like everyone on the team, [Chang] put in work this summer,” Henderson said. “It’s great to see that he’s having success on the field.”
Harvard tallied just two goals over its slow 0-3 start, but largely because of Chang, the Crimson has since come rallying back. Harvard now heads into Ivy League play having won its last five matches, outscoring its opponents by nine goals over that stretch.
“I’m really excited for the Ivies to start just as everyone else is,” Chang said. “I’m ready to do what I can for the team.”
With momentum now in their favor, Chang and the Crimson head into the second half of the season seeking to continue surprising onlookers in pursuit of the junior’s tall goals for the season.
“Our goal is to win a national championship,” Chang said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team prepared for Tuesday evening’s game the same as always, high-fiving each player as her name was announced at midfield, with each member yelling the team’s traditional “H-F-H” cheer before the starting whistle sounded.
Following the Crimson’s only losses of the season last week, the energy seemed different as Harvard took the field.
Displaying relentlessness from the start, the Crimson (6-2, 1-1 Ivy) scored the first of six goals within the first two minutes of play against UMass Lowell (4-6) to defeat the River Hawks, 6-0, at Jordan Field. Junior back Elizabeth Jacobson earned her first career hat trick with Harvard’s fourth, fifth, and sixth strikes of the first half.
“We wanted to get back on a winning streak,” co-captain Caitlin Rea said. “We knew how good it felt. Our rule this season is [to capitalize on the] first five minutes.”
The Crimson demonstrated just what that rule meant, scoring all of its goals in the first 25 minutes and finishing the first half with 13 shots in total. Sophomore Marissa Balleza scored her sixth goal of the season just after the one-minute mark, setting the tone for the team.
“We went hard [at the beginning] and it worked,” Rea said. “I think that gave us the momentum for the next 70 minutes. With our first goal, we put them on their heels, which is always our aim. Start strong, make them a little bit scared, and then just go hard.”
Senior Kaitlyn Boudah deftly located the back of the net with the next two goals (her third and fourth of the season). The forward led her teammates by pressuring the ball in UMass Lowell’s defensive third to rebound Balleza’s shot for her first score of the game.
After an effortless pass from freshman midfielder Ellie Cookson, Boudah scored her second goal of the evening to take Harvard to 3-0 five minutes later.
“We were able to get on the board very early which gave us comfort,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “But I think we came out today with an attitude not to lose and to go for it. Take some risk.”
Not satisfied with its early lead, the Crimson players continued to pressure the ball, and remain aggressive on the field.
“After our [loss] against Penn, we sat down and went through the things we had to work on,” Rea said. “We had one practice, and we decided we were going to make ourselves confident again and get ready to play.”
Perhaps that mentality guided Jacobson during her hat trick against the River Hawks. The versatile back put in her second, third, and fourth goals of the season between 18:24 and 24:23 of the first half.
“It felt great to finish the passes that I get from the backfield,” Jacobson said. “It’s really nice to be able to contribute like that, because they do all the hard work.”
Feeling confident to empty the Crimson bench in the second half, van Herwaarden substituted at multiple positions, yet his team kept the visitors on their toes. The new line of players fired eight shots, maintaining constant pressure on the offensive end.
“We have a team of girls who can play a lot of positions,” Rea said. “When people got subbed in, they brought a different aspect to the game and everyone pushed hard. It was great to see everyone on the field and everyone get to play.”
According to Rea, her teammates feel relaxed and confident as they approach the midway point of their regular season. Harvard will need to maintain this focus and extend its win streak against Brown (4-2, 0-2) and Boston University (4-4).
“The mentality was to have fun, and that always works for us,” Rea said. “When you have fun, you don’t overthink and I think that’s one thing we did in the last two games. We just need to keep it up.”

Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr. is the best-connected man we've ever met. We know because we went to the 2014 W.E.B. Du Bois Medal Ceremony, which also functioned as a get together for Skip and Friends and his soon-to-be friends.
Mankiw has nothing on him.
The ceremony honored Oprah Winfrey, Shonda Rhimes, Harry Belafonte, David Adjaye, Harvey Weinstein, Steve McQueen, and John Lewis in recognition of their accomplishments and contributions to African American culture. Also in attendance were Jamaica Kincaid, William Julius Wilson, Lawrence Bobo, and Maya Angelou, posthumously. Yeah, we were pretty starstruck as well.
We waited in the cold drizzle for twenty minutes for tickets, but on the plus side, Queen Oprah Winfrey stepped out of her black Cadillac Escalade and said "hey" to us, so we were pretty OK with it. For those of you who missed out on that opportunity, we've recapped the experience in 140 character soundbites for the modern attention span. It'll be like you were there:

Put those Econ textbooks down, solve that last math problem, and finish up the conclusion to your English paper, for it is ArtWeek Boston 2014! Take a break to unleash your inner artist at multiple events being held by the Highland Street Foundation from until October 5th. Check out some of the events that are going on for the rest of this week, and some of our favorites below!
ArtApp Boston + Scavenger Hunt and After Party: Download the ArtApp Boston+ app and join fellow art enthusiasts in a scavenger hunt! This is a great chance to both explore Boston and learn about art (and to Instagram all of the #artsy moments that are sure to happen). Solve three of the clues before the hunt’s conclusion tomorrow on October 2nd and you will be invited to a private soirée at an undisclosed location.
Shimmer: If you happen to be at or around the intersection of Congress and Dorchester Streets in Fort Point today, stop at Claudia Ravaschiere’s and Mike Moss’s temporary art installation that can be seen in between the railings along the Harbor Walk of Fort Point Channel. Why should you go? For the artists out there, the way natural and ambient light are used to create “a kinetic field of altering hues” will be a source of contemplative conversation. For the physicists, the refractive qualities of the plexiglass and wind-driven kinetics might be of interest. For those who do not identify with either of those groups, it’s pretty.
Frost Beat: Spend tomorrow evening from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at FROST ICE BAR chilling with friends while “explor[ing] the sight, sound, and feel of ice as a musical element”. It's rumored to be the “coolest concert hall in history” quite literally, as the venue is kept at a nippy 21 degrees. Remember to dress warmly!
Hacking Arts: Calling all CS50 students to take part in Friday’s Hackathon kick off, hosted by Microsoft's NERD Center. While you hack away from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., you can also enjoy a performance from Harvard’s own A. Ryan Leslie '98.
Make a Ring Workshop and Tour the Sam Adams Brewery: Channel Sauron from Lord of the Rings and learn the basics of jewelry making (sans sorcery) on Saturday October 4th from 11:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m at Stonybrook Fine Arts. Solder, anneal, and file your very own rings to show off to your friends. People of all skill levels are welcome! Afterwards, take a peek inside Boston’s famous Sam Adams Brewery right across the street.

Happy first day of October! We hope that the first month of the semester went out with a bang (in a good way) and that you’re looking forward to the one ahead. We’re finally feeling the fall spirit, and we’re sure you are too! Five points for every person you see Instagraming the foliage over the past few days. Bonus points if they end up using a black and white filter (seriously, we’ve seen it done).
You may see a number of people on campus wearing yellow or carrying umbrellas today, and maybe you are yourself. This campaign is the work of students around the world to raise awareness and solidarity for protesters in Hong Kong who are fighting for democracy. Read more about the situation in Hong Kong here, here, here, here, and here.
You can learn more about the campaign by visiting their website: wearyellowforhk.tumblr.com. Yesterday, TIME magazine posted an article about the campaign and interviewed Heather L. Pickerell '15, a Crimson editor. The more you know! You stop by the Science Center from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. to pick up a yellow ribbon and to speak to students involved in organizing this campaign.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today’s high is 61 degrees, with a low of 55. There’s a 70% chance of rain all day, which will make the walk to classes even less bearable than usual. However, dealing with it all day will probably entitle you to a delicious hot chocolate at some point? Whether it’s Starbucks or HUDS, you’ll have earned it.

December 13, 2013. It’s just after midnight, and Beyoncé has released her fifth solo album, an album that she managed to keep secret until its reveal in 119 countries. Fans and the media are shocked. How could there have been no leaks? How had the star partnered with Apple, Facebook and Instagram to keep the 14 songs and 17 companion videos a secret? How did one of the most watched women in the world keep an album under wraps that would gross $1.43 million within a month?
Harvard regularly studies leading politicians or Nobel Prize winners to see just how they got to where they are today. But this week the question is being posed to a different subject: one of the world’s biggest celebrities. Anita Elberse, Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and Stacie Smith, MBA ’14 tackle one of the greatest stunts of the past year in a study set to be released in the next few days.
Beyoncé has described the decision as an effort to keep the album intact, making a point about the problems of releasing singles prior to the album itself. But Rolling Stone’s Rob Sheffield described the release as: “a celebration of the Beyoncé Philosophy, which basically boils down to the fact that Beyoncé can do anything the hell she wants to.”
And the public and the media don’t seem to mind that Beyoncé can basically control the world (except maybe the time she took over Lenox Hill Hospital to give birth to her daughter Blue Ivy, which was met with protest from mothers who were upset that they couldn’t see their own newborn children). ‘Beyoncé’ was the fastest selling item in the iTunes store ever—even though customers were required to buy the entire album and couldn’t purchase any individual song.
The Harvard Business School study questions the business sense of such a huge worldwide musical surprise. After iTunes’ exclusive weeklong sales ended, major retailers such as Target and Amazon refused to sell the album. How is it possible to follow-up on such an influential release? Isn’t Beyoncé’s sixth album bound to be somewhat anti-climactic? And can other artists do it, or is this a strategy reserved for Sasha Fierce?
Elberse, who studies successful products in entertainment and other creative fields, will be teaching the Beyoncé case in her class “Strategic Marketing in Creative Industries.” She is the author of “Blockbusters: Hit-making, Risk-taking and the Big Business of Entertainment,” which analyzes the success of superstars, including the other half of the Knowles-Carter power duo, Jay Z.
The Harvard community waits for the release of Elberse and Smith’s study this week. Yes, Harvard kids are able to hear from leaders in a variety of fields on a daily basis, but they also want to know how Beyoncé pulled it off. From Single Ladies on Saturday nights to late night p-sets accompanied by Crazy in Love, HBS must know that Beyoncé is an honorary Harvard woman, too.
