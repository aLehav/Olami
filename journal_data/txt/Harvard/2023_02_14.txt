Boston-born Rosie Darling made a thrilling return to her hometown at The Red Room at Cafe 939 on Feb. 6, to deliver an energetic and intimate concert fitting of the vermilion venue. The singer-songwriter made a name for herself early on with her 2020 debut, “Coping,” working with producers OKO and EDM duo Tritional. The EP reflects Darling’s mindset as she dealt with her move from the East Coast to Los Angeles, facing head-on a new home and a daunting network of artists to navigate.
Her short-but-sweet setlist embodied this daunting sentiment, a combination of high-energy and delicate songs, all colored with the raw, vulnerable nature that characterizes Darling’s music. Entering with her heart on her sleeve, Darling opened with 2021’s “Reruns,” a tender song with a driving beat that made it a crowd-pleaser. The rest of the set took the audience through a selection of Darling's top hits without neglecting those quieter, more intimate moments, which the indie-pop artist delivered from mere feet away — even for those standing at the back of the room. The cozy setting and bright ambient lighting of the venue only enhanced Darling’s ability to touch the hearts and minds of her fans as she sang “Heavy,” “Always Almost,” and “Golden Age.”
Though she was interrupted by technical difficulties, Darling did not miss a beat, taking a moment to interact with the crowd while the behind-the-scenes work was done. She got the audience to sing “Happy Birthday” to one lucky concert-goer whose birthday was the upcoming weekend. If anything, perhaps the technical difficulties proved a rare and fortunate chance for Darling to speak to the audience, which she did not have much time for given that she shared the evening with Ashley Kutcher. This is not to say that Darling did not interact with the audience — in fact, she made ample use of her proximity to give viewers an entertaining and personal experience. The technical errors could not throw Darling off her game — she picked up right where she left off delivering emotional and delightful renditions of “Say Less,” “What a Convincing Illusion,” and “Witness.” One audience member was even in tears at her performance.
For her last song — the moment everyone in the room had been waiting for — Darling sang a beautiful and spirited rendition of her hit song “Coping.” This closeout to a wonderful performance had audience members singing along with Darling, sending her off the stage with uproarious applause. The only complaint to be had was that the performance was too brief — Rosie Darling clearly has a successful future ahead of her.

Grammy-award winner Hannah K. Adler ’25 is at the forefront of modern classical music.
In 2020, Adler and many other classically-trained musicians between the ages of 12 and 22 — as members of the New York Youth Symphony (NYYS) — recorded an album that made history at the recent 65th Grammy Awards. Their album, which only included pieces written by Black female composers, won Best Orchestral Performance. Adler, who sat as the principal second violinist on these pieces, had no idea this pandemic project would be such a success.
Adler initially began playing the violin at the age of four and attended several music camps prior to obtaining the principal seat for the NYYS. A native of western Massachusetts, Adler would commute two and a half hours every Sunday to New York City for rehearsals during her junior and senior years of high school. Despite this, Adler found the commute to be relatively manageable. “My grandpa sort of lives outside the city, so sometimes I would stay over Saturday night to make it all work. It was a lot of commitment from my parents, which was really nice,” Adler said.
When the NYYS’s spring concert was canceled in 2020 due to Covid-19, the violinist confessed that “at that point, I don’t think on anyone’s mind was like ‘oh, well what is my symphony going to do next,’ there’s much bigger things to think about.” However, it turned out that the administration and conductor of the symphony, Michael Repper, had been planning something all along for the musicians to stay connected with the orchestra during this time of isolation.
The NYYS ended up taking on a project whose success would be realized in 2023. 14-time Grammy Award winner and producer Judith Sherman organized a recording session with the symphony, and Adler was thrilled.
“It was a period of four days, I think the string players were only there for three of the four,” Adler said. “To totally mitigate Covid … we had to split up into groups, so we recorded separately. We never actually heard them.”
Adler recalled not knowing what the piece would sound like with her violin part until she had heard the final recording. She called Repper and the producers’ music engineering work “some serious magic.”
Adler also found the choice of songs on the album to be extremely unique. Made up of pieces from three Black, female composers — Florence Price, Jessie Montgomery, and Valerie Coleman — the album represents a wide historical range of modern classical music from the 1930s to the present.
Typical programming for orchestral albums includes works from composers whose pieces have been around for centuries, such as Beethoven or Mozart. Adler and the NYYS were excited to provide a fresh perspective to the world of classical music.
“People like Jessie Montgomery who are obviously still living and living through the same things that we are all living through, especially in the past five years, when she writes something that is responding to something we’ve all lived through, there’s way more that goes into thinking about how to perform it and how to digest it and understand it as more than an art form, rather than a bourgeoisie activity that rich people go pay money to see,” Adler said.
Adler wanted to highlight the importance of this album and the work of the NYYS. As a tuition-free organization, the symphony often premiers new and upcoming composers' scores through their program, First Music. Although the NYYS was not the first to perform the compositions by Price, Montgomery, and Coleman, they were the first to have this opportunity to record an album of these pieces and have it produced by Judith Sherman.
Upon finishing the recording, Adler recalls her conductor being confident that the album would be Grammy-Award-winning material. NYYS’s album was special compared to other nominated orchestras’ albums in the category that Adler described as being dominated by “massive, really professional orchestras.” These groups like the Berlin Philharmonic and Los Angeles Philharmonic performed more traditional programs, according to Adler. She believes the NYYS stood out because their album included new, modern works from a diverse set of composers.

Pop singer-songwriter Lyn Lapid’s latest single sees her paired with beloved pop and R&B singer Ruth B. for what results in a bouncy, inordinately catchy, but ultimately inoffensive tune to soundtrack late-night drives and middle-aged runs for the next few weeks to come.
“Do U Really?” opens with those words precisely; the song’s intro is its first chorus, ringing out with a Lapid solo backed by dreamy vibraphone and periodically accompanied by a simple yet effective stack of vocals. As she constantly asks the listener whether they “really want to fall in love,” Lapid quickly builds up the lyrical thread carried throughout the whole song. Her potentially enchanting proposition of choosing deep love over a shallow hook-up ends up falling somewhat flat, though, with a verse that combines seemingly disconnected lines like “Wonder if we let this love grow / I won’t have it in me just to let go” with an overall lack of lyrical risk-taking.
This isn’t par for the course for Lapid, who blasted onto the music scene in late 2020 with her TikTok smash hit “Producer Man” — a song whose lyrics deftly follow the struggles of a wide-eyed girl new to the pitfalls of the music industry. Yet “Do U Really?” credits four people for its lyrics, including producer Ido Zmishlany and English songwriter Joel Baker, and this writing dilution stands as a primary suspect for the uninspired lyrics that are emblematic of a broader trend: In her first big collaboration with an established artist, Lapid — or her label — chooses to play it safe.
With the first hit of the bass drum, however, all concerns with lyrics go out the window. Zmishlany, who has produced for the likes of Shawn Mendes, Imagine Dragons, and Justin Bieber, lays down a truly uncontainable beat, with layers of Lapid’s signature ukulele providing a crisp foreground to a restless pairing of drums and bass that inevitably leads to unconscious head-nods from listeners. Dark synth organs and ghostly backing vocals provide the finishing touches on a beat that swings in full force on the first chorus. Apart from an apparent mistreatment of vocals, the song’s production stands as its strongest aspect, morphing a simple verse and chorus repetition into a fluid, connected piece.
And then Ruth B. comes in. Lyrically, her verse does little to clarify the storyline, although couplets like “Opening up on the drive home / You were giving me hints, winks and high hopes” introduce clever rhyming quips that can only satisfy the ear. The singer of “Lost Boy” and “Dandelions,” however, fails to add to this song the most iconic aspect of her artistry: Her voice. To an inattentive listener, the switch between the two singers might even go unnoticed; as much as the production creates a beat that shines, Ruth’s voice ends up over-processed in a way that stifles her raw talent with the exception of a pleasant run or two at the tail end of the song. Overall, her contribution seems to be more valuable as name-recognition for potential fans than as a genuine addition to the song.
Lapid released an ultimately safe song that had a big name collaboration, a talented producer, and a basic storyline — and that’s okay. Every fan needs a cache of songs with a fun beat to get them bobbing their head without thinking too deeply. In the end, though, Lapid will find herself among the myriad of TikTok artists thrown at a wall, and songs like this — while not detrimental to anyone—won’t be the ones that help her stick.

It was only 12 degrees outside in Harvard Square on Feb. 4, but dangerously freezing temperatures didn’t stop die-hard Jennifer Cooldige fans from gathering on Mass Ave. to get a glimpse of the actress as she was honored with a parade as Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. Fans glanced up and down the street, clutching themselves to stay warm, anxious to see her familiar blond waves and hear that unmistakable voice. Suddenly, the distinctly eerie harp melody and operatic yodeling of “The White Lotus” theme song could be heard in the distance, underpinned by an energetic EDM beat: Jennifer Coolidge was near.
Coolidge, who just won her first Golden Globe for her role as Tanya McQuoid in the hit HBO series “The White Lotus,” is the 73rd person to be named Woman of the Year by Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals. Coolidge was honored alongside actor Bob Odenkirk as Man of the Year. The Woman of the Year festivities included a parade through Harvard Square, a roast, a press conference, and her attendance at the Pudding’s staging of their show “Cosmic Relief.”
Jennifer Coolidge established herself as a Hollywood icon with her scene-stealing comedic roles in popular 2000s movies like “Legally Blonde, “American Pie,” and “A Cinderella Story.” But it was her role as Tanya McQuoid — the only recurring main character in Seasons 1 and 2 of Mike White’s “The White Lotus” — that recently skyrocketed her career to new heights and garnered her attention during awards season. Coolidge’s hilarious portrayal of the well-meaning but vacuous and bumbling millionaire Tanya has endeared her to a new legion of fans.
Some spectators braved serious wind chills to see Coolidge in the flesh, waiting expectantly on the street before the parade began; others emerged from J.P. Licks shocked to hear she was in the neighborhood — cries of ”No way!” and “Shut up!” were yelled in disbelief as they realized the actress was in their midst.
Several Harvard students were in attendance in addition to other residents from the Boston/Cambridge area.
“I think it's exciting, I actually just watched ‘White Lotus’ over break, and she’s in both seasons and she’s kind of the common element across the show. So I think because I just watched it, it's super relevant in my mind right now,” said Annika S. Huprikar ’24, who waited on the sidewalk with friends for the parade to start.
Coolidge coasted down the street in a convertible Bentley, surrounded by Hasty Pudding members wearing a variety of whimsical and colorful outfits. Dressed in a leopard fur coat and pink fuzzy hat, she waved graciously to the crowds surrounding her parade car. Patrons of Clover and students in the Smith Campus Center alike stopped what they were doing to gaze out the windows as the parade turned the corner onto Holyoke St., where it would end in front of Farkas Hall. Some fans held signs with adoring messages like “J. Cool U Rule.”
Later in the day, Coolidge was welcomed on stage at Farkas Hall for her honorary roast, in which she had to endure some pointed wisecracks and complete a few challenges in order to earn her Pudding Pot. For example, roasters Aidan Golub ’24 and Sarah Mann ’23 listed her characters from “American Pie,” “A Cinderella Story,” and “The Emoji Movie” as “iconic MILFS” — Miscast in Lackluster Films.
Her first task was to be the judge of a Jennifer Coolidge pageant, rating four different impersonators of herself on a scale from one to ten.
“Can they both be ones?” she asked after the first two impersonators came on stage, doing impressions of Coolidge in “Legally Blonde 2” and “A Cinderella Story.”
The fourth impressionist, Matthew Cole ’25, delivered the iconic line “I’m takin’ the dog, dumbass,” from “Legally Blonde.” The crowd screamed in approval, and even Coolidge herself couldn’t disapprove. “That’s a ten,” she said.
Coolidge didn’t even have to say much to amuse the crowd — her mannerisms seemed to reflect some of her famous comedic characters, and even a simple “alright” or “wow” delivered in her signature airy voice was enough to elicit laughter from the audience.
Coolidge continued to participate gamely in each subsequent task. After giving an impromptu makeover to Golub, she was prompted to lead a master class in the bend-and-snap maneuver, another beloved moment from “Legally Blonde.” “But put your boobs up,” she said as a token of advice.
Later in the roast, Coolidge was asked to dress as a dolphin named Tuna McQuoid — she once said she wanted to play a dolphin — and read queue cards for a skit. “Oh my God, please please, these rays, they’re trying to murder me! These rays, these rays!” she cried out as Pudding actors dressed as sting rays flocked on stage. To the audience’s delight, this was an homage to her line “These gays, these gays, they’re trying to murder me!” from “The White Lotus” — a quote that took over the Internet and became an instant classic once heard in the Season 2 finale this past December.
Once she was finally deemed deserving of her Pudding Pot, Coolidge was welcomed to say a few words to the audience.
“Am I allowed to put it down?” she asked, à la her Golden Globes speech delivered in January. “I’ve been so blown away that this experience is happening. I never saw it coming and it blows away any sort of movie or television show I’ve ever done,” she said.
Coolidge began to choke up as she talked about her late father, Paul Constant Coolidge, who graduated from Harvard in 1942.
“Seriously, you know, my dad went here. I wish he was here,” she said. “And his brothers went here, so it’s a big deal. And like I said, this is amazing.”
Coolidge and a few Hasty Pudding members joined journalists in the press conference room of Farkas Hall immediately following the roast, where she was able to elaborate on her father’s influence on her life and career. She revealed that it was her father who first told her to pursue acting.
“That’s why this night is such a big deal, because my father was such a practical person, but I love that he had impractical ideas for me. It was so out of my father’s character, you know he said to me, ‘I think you should be an actress’... This would have just been his dream come true…. Truly, one of the greatest nights of my life, because it just came full circle. It just has so much meaning,” she said.
Coolidge also spoke of the overall arc of her career, and how it felt to be celebrated as Woman of the Year at this point in her journey.
“My feelings as a young person would be extremely hopeful, and having giant dreams, and you know, having very, very low moments too. And to be here, tonight, I don’t know. It was all worth it. It was all worth it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College sophomores have it the worst: navigating new housing, mind-numbing general education classes, and, in Leigh Bardugo’s most recent novel, fighting the demons of hell. “Hell Bent,” a sequel to Bardugo’s much-loved adult fantasy novel “Ninth House,” follows the struggles of Yale’s strangest sophomore, Galaxy “Alex” Stern. Not much has changed since “Ninth House”: Yale’s class reading lists are grueling, secret magic societies are performing rituals that transform the world, and Alex’s mentor Darlington is still missing somewhere in hell. Throughout the novel’s fast-moving plot, Bardugo weaves Alex’s world of magic into more contemporary experiences of trauma, elitism, and regret. Not every aspect of this combination is successful, and “Hell Bent” suffers from a mild case of second-book slog, but overall, Bardugo has again created a wildly entertaining magical world.
Magic works in the “Alex Stern” trilogy because it seems entirely realistic. The fantastical magic system exists in the underbelly of the modern world. It is not grandiose or idealized in any way, but instead grimy, creepy, and sometimes even vile. Alex, who possesses the magic ability to see ghosts, ponders why the members of Yale’s secret societies seek out strange magic rituals. She sees people do the strangest things for a trip of power — like a famous pop singer eating the feces of a magic bird to regain her chart-topping voice. Instead of being decorative background information, magic is a crucial part of the novel’s themes and plot. Magic and its repercussions become a representation of many things in the novel — greed, power, control — all of which Alex must continually fight against.
But at almost 500 pages,“Hell Bent” is quite lengthy, and lots of this time feels wasted. There are seemingly random side characters that Alex deals with, including an old rival from California, a rich drug-dealing vampire, and a cranky professor who oversees her work in one of Yale’s secret societies. These can tire the reader and even feel quite repetitive, since some of Alex’s foes have returned from “Ninth House.” These attempts to expand Alex Stern’s world feel a little like filler, and much of it could have been cut down to liven up the novel’s pace.
The biggest weakness of “Hell Bent” is the fact that it truly feels like a sequel. It lacks its own identity, riding in the shadow of the first book, and doesn’t begin to take its own shape until its final act. A sizable chunk of the third act also wastes time setting up the third novel. It feels as if the overarching “Alex Stern” series could easily be adjusted to be a duology, eliminating the strange liminal space that “Hell Bent” seems to reside in. While the novel attempts to delve deeper into Alex’s traumas revealed in “Ninth House,” it feels more like a rehashing of events than a deep dive.
However, the last third of the book ricochets back into Bardugo’s signature gripping style. This last section was impossible to put down as all of the worldbuilding and character studies finally clicked into place. As Alex juggles fighting demons, saving Darlington, and facing her past trauma, the results of her earlier side quests suddenly come into fruition. In this final section, Bardugo is at her best.
It is remarkable that Bardugo is able to infuse what first appears to be a typical young adult fantasy series into something much more striking. It goes beyond surface-level displays of magic and romance to reflect upon pressing social problems. As Alex tries to save Darlington from hell, she grapples with the meaning of who is and isn’t redeemable. Heavy themes, such as drug abuse, murder, and self harm are all treated with care amidst the swirling drama of Yale. Magic is more than magic — it is a way to reflect on events from the past and misuses of power.
Overall, “Hell Bent” does exactly what it should do. It is funny, gripping, and deeply melodramatic in the endearing way that only modern fantasy novels can be. However, it is not perfect, with its biggest weaknesses lying in its inconsistent pacing and grueling length. The overall success of the “Alex Stern” series will hinge upon the highly awaited third novel.

On her latest single “Internet Trolls,” Memphis rapper Glorilla has some strong words for those who exploit the shroud of internet privacy. A self-help song for the ‘chronically’ online, “Internet Trolls” is another instant hit following the rapper’s meteoric rise to fame. The new single coincides with Glorilla’s performance at the 65th annual Grammy awards, and comes in advance of her highly anticipated debut studio album.
This time, though, “Internet Trolls” sees Glorilla step outside of her usual musical domain to take on a crunk-inspired beat. While the rapper’s last two hits, “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” and “Tomorrow 2,” fit squarely within the trap genre, “Internet Trolls” blends trap and crunk, employing the slow-grinding tempo distinctive of the hip-hop subgenre. The song opens with a series of booming horns, then a snare pattern lead-in, before blowing out the speakers with stripped-down bass and trap hi-hats when the beat drops.
This earworm beat fits a well-established southern trap formula that, at this point, somewhat necessarily induces excitement and hype within listeners. Yet the beat also embraces elements of Y2K hip-hop, with blasting horns emblematic of tracks like“Get Buck” by fellow Tennessee rapper Young Buck.
Lyrically, Glorilla rebukes internet falsities and the track’s titular “trolls” — chronically online cyberbullies. She eschews the stifling norms and constraints of the internet, preaching a life that values face-to-face and intimate contact over intangible internet clout. With lyrics like “You could be who you wanna be, live how you wanna live,” Glorilla tells her listeners to break free of social media’s often damaging pressures and expectations.
Clocking in at under two and a half minutes, the song is somewhat gossamer in nature, with barely two choruses and verses. “Internet Trolls” doesn’t exactly re-invent the genre. But it’s sure to give fans just enough of Glorilla’s signature style to keep them satisfied until her debut album arrives.

Valeria Luiselli, an author and Bard College professor can be found teaching creative writing classes this year as a visiting Harvard professor. She has published six books, including the critically acclaimed “The Story of My Teeth” which won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the American Book Award.
Winner of the 2019 American Book Award, Luiselli is also an author and visiting Professor of Ethnicity, Indigeneity, and Migration in Harvard’s English Department. Luiselli centers her work around bridging the gap between literature and social justice. Across her career, she has worked closely with factory workers, incarcerated people, and children detained at the U.S.-Mexico border.
In a recent interview with The Harvard Crimson, Luiselli described the crucial overlap of her work with both in-person and literary activism. Writing in both English and Spanish, Luiselli offers a completely novel use of language. One way Luiselli toys with language is by translating her own writing back and forth, letting the words decide for her what language (or languages) to use for each text.
“I never know which [language] I should use for a project when I'm just starting,” Luiselli says. She recommends that students who are bilingual “just try both, until something falls into place, or until maybe the text itself reveals that it just needs to be bilingual.”
Although originally born in Mexico City, Luiselli spent much of her childhood moving from country to country. Much of her writing pulls from her cultural experiences in these different countries including South Korea, South Africa, India, and the United States.
When speaking about her most recent novel, “Lost Children Archive,” Luiselli said, “I tried both languages. And one day it just started flowing better in English. And so you know, it's something that has to do a lot with rhythm and tone.”
Luiselli considers translation an “art form.” While she has collaborated with other translators in the past, nowadays, she only translates her own work, finding this process essential to her “creative process.”
Luiselli also believes in forming a relationship with her work, not only with language, but with her characters — even those that she cannot personally relate to.
“I almost felt like I had to allow a character to inhabit me in a way where I just needed to channel and not necessarily, always like them.”
In both "Faces in the Crowd" and “The Story of My Teeth,” Luiselli focuses her stories on male main characters.
“I write from the point of view of a man in the 1920s… whose views on masculinity and femininity and race and many other things are not my own,” said Luiselli about her character from “Faces in the Crowd,” “but I had to make the effort of inhabiting him.”
Conversely, she recalls, in “The Story of My Teeth,” “I wrote that book in a series of installments for workers in the juice factory. And I never saw their faces […] I assumed, because one assumes things wrongly, that because they were juice factory workers, they would all be guys.”
For this project, Luiselli and the factory workers sent audio files back and forth, so she did not meet any of the participants face-to-face until the book launch. She remarks, “I thought I’m going to write from the point of view of a guy […] to create a much closer proximity […] and then it turned out that at least the workers that had signed up for this experiment in writing and reading had been mostly female workers.”
Luiselli views her writing as activism, whether that be writing from the perspective of factory or border detention workers. Luiselli reveals that she writes her own books about immigration and violence against land.
“I will continue to do so because it’s the only thing I know how to do.”
Luiselli’s current writing activism continues her work teaching underserved communities, with her current role teaching a creative writing program for young girls in a New York detention center. The author sees a future of writing wherein people will be able to write honestly from their experience for themselves and for readers. “I do feel like teaching creative writing, especially to a generation that has had to go through a brutal form of displacement is giving [them] the tools to eventually write their own stories in whatever form they want.”
Valeria Luiselli’s understanding of the power of language has enabled her own writing, activism, and teaching. Her unique perspective on the creative process, as well as her confidence in her own abilities allows her to experiment with different languages and techniques. From writing from the perspective of characters completely different from her, to incorporating lived experiences into her work, Luiselli has developed all of the necessary tools to create meaningful stories and hopes to pass that gift on to the next generation of writers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For those of us who spent the early 2000s engaging with reality TV programming of dubious educational value, the year 2023 marks a special occasion: Tyra Banks, supermodel, actor, and host of the reality TV show “America’s Next Top Model,” turns 50 years old. Banks, who rose to fame in the era of the ’90s supermodel, notably broke barriers as the first African-American model to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated and model for Victoria’s Secret.
However, the tide of public opinion seems to be turning against this runway legend as TikTok users scrutinize her role on “America's Next Top Model,” a show which frequently body-shamed contestants and used blackface on more than one occasion. As Banks’s legacy comes under fire, the tension between outdated standards “supermodels” like Banks represent and today’s values of inclusivity and diversity is more apparent than ever.
The recent backlash against Tyra Banks is representative of larger shifts in attitudes toward the modeling industry as a whole. Victoria’s Secret, a brand famous for its hyper-sexualized, ultra-thin “Angels,” of which Banks was a founding member, has recently replaced its roster of top models with a collective of seven entrepreneurs and activists who are, as the "New York Times" reports, “famous for their achievements, not their proportions.” In an interview with The New York Times, Victoria’s Secret CEO Mark Waters said that the decision to rebrand came once the company realized that the Angels and the unrealistic beauty standard they represent are no longer “culturally relevant,” as changing societal values have spurred efforts to redefine the modeling industry in a manner that promotes diversity and empowerment.
As the fashion industry increasingly supports more realistic and inclusive representations of beauty, episodes from Tyra Banks’s early tenure as host of “America's Next Top Model” in the 2000s feel like a time capsule from fashion’s Dark Ages. TikTok users have been particularly harsh critics of the unrealistic beauty standards the show perpetuated. One user filmed themselves reacting with horror as Tyra Banks pressured an “America's Next Top Model”contestant to undergo dental surgery to close a gap in her teeth, saying that her natural smile was not “marketable.” TikTok user @2theroot claimed that the frequent instances of body shaming “ruined” their mental health as a viewer of the show. A series of videos titled “Why Tyra Banks Is Going to Hell” indicate that Banks has become the focalized target for all backlash against past and present instances of sizeism and racism within the fashion industry.
It’s important to note that Banks — a model herself and one of the few Black supermodels of her generation — was often on the receiving end of the modeling industry’s toxic beauty standards. In 2007, while Banks was acting as the host of “America's Next Top Model,” she was ruthlessly attacked in the media for an unposed paparazzi picture taken of her at the beach, with titles like “Tyra Porkchops” splattered across tabloids. In a 2017 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Banks admitted that the rejection and discrimination she experienced as a Black, curvy woman in the fashion industry made her “empathize with people who didn’t fit the cookie-cutter,” and motivated her to include non-conventional models in “America's Next Top Model” to “tell millions of girls around the world who looked like them that they were beautiful.”
Rewatching “America’s Next Top Model,” it is clear why Banks believed she was broadening the definition of beauty through her work on the show. Before its cancellation in 2018, “America’s Next Top Model” featured openly gay and transgender contestants, chose its first plus-size winner in 2008, and famously cast current supermodel Winnie Harlow, who has vitiligo, in 2014 — all years before brands like Aerie or Savage x Fenty made runway inclusivity mainstream. In fact, Tyra Banks received a GLAAD award in 2009 for her “strong commitment to educating the public about the lives of gay and transgender people” on “America's Next Top Model.”
However, conversations about the identities and appearances of diverse contestants were often mishandled — in 2005, Banks spoke to openly gay contestant Kim Stolz about not making her gayness too conspicuous to potential employers — and even as racially diverse groups of models appeared on the show, contestants were painted in blackface in order to portray ethnicities different from their own.
It is difficult to reconcile Banks’s legacy as a barrier-breaking top model with deplorable instances of body shaming and insensitivity on the show she produced and hosted. However, perhaps Banks and her most famous creation should be viewed as reflections of the modeling industry as a whole, and not as unique outliers in the fashion ecosystem that serve as a scapegoat for all criticism. One video from the show that has received particular backlash — in which Banks and the other judges discuss plus-sized contestant Robin Manning — emphasizes the inherent body scrutiny present in the modeling industry. Notably, Banks does not ridicule Manning’s body, though other judges accuse her of being “huge.” Instead, Banks remarks that Robin would be a difficult candidate to market because “on the top, she’s not plus-sized and on the bottom, she is.” The video illustrates that even when not engaging in outright size discrimination, the modeling industry demands that the vast diversity of human bodies and identities be pigeonholed into limited categories to market to the public, and rejects people that do not conform to those standards.
An industry that categorizes, commodifies, and markets human bodies will always be “problematic.” It’s time to stop blaming Tyra Banks circa 2003 for the modeling industry’s insidious culture.

British singer-songwriter RAYE’s debut album “My 21st Century Blues” arrives just months after her chart-topping single “Escapism.” Though this is her first album, she is in no way new to the music industry. Signed to Polydor Records from 2014 to 2021, she wrote tracks for Beyoncé, Ellie Goulding, and John Legend, also collaborating with EDM artists like David Guetta and Joel Corry. Newly independent from her label, RAYE is now taking advantage of her newfound creative control to craft the music she wants to make. As she fuses elements of blues and synth-pop with her own style, RAYE channels her rage, trauma, and frustrations into the candid and beautifully juxtaposed record.
The album begins with “Introduction.,” which welcomes listeners to a 21st-century blues club and leads into her next track “Oscar Winning Tears.” A powerful ballad that escalates to a belt, RAYE’s “Oscar Winning Tears.” describes a manipulative relationship that she refuses to tolerate any longer. Though intended for chronological listening, the album is a compilation of the songs RAYE has wanted to release over the years and thus lacks a straightforward storyline.
Her lead single “Hard Out Here.,” first released in June 2022, is RAYE’s first independent release after leaving her previous label, Polydor Records. She channels her rage as the song escalates into a condemnation of male executives within the music industry with the line “All the white men CEOs, fuck your privilege / Get your pink chubby hands off my mouth, fuck you think this is?” Referencing how she had been silenced by her previous record label and the instances of sexual assault she experienced, RAYE reclaims her name with “Hard Out Here.,” “Ice Cream Man.,” and “Black Mascara.”
“My 21st Century Blues” covers a huge scope of contemporary dilemmas like the climate crisis and body image with “Environmental Anxiety.” and “Body Dysmorphia.” The busy humming at the start of “Environmental Anxiety.” foreshadows the chaotic lyrics, which spiral into a frenzy of worries that RAYE voices. The song’s lyrics are quite literally anxiety-inducing as RAYE runs through lists of uncontrollable matters like the state of the climate crisis, the overconsumption of social media, and the selection of world leaders.
“Escapism.,” featuring a verse by 070 Shake, is undoubtedly the highlight of this album. With dark, sultry lyrics set to a catchy beat, the song describes the descent into a cycle of alcoholism, drug abuse, and meaningless sex to deal with heartbreak. Her chorus echoes, “I don’t wanna feel how I did last night / Doctor, doctor, anything, please / Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me / You’re asking for my symptoms, doctor, I don’t wanna feel” as she begs her doctor for medications that will numb her feelings.
The album comes to a close with “Fin.” — a beautiful tribute to those who contributed to the creation of “My 21st Century Blues.” This album marks RAYE’s first independent release with producer Mike Sabath and features both British R&B singer Mahalia and 070 Shake.
“My 21st Century Blues'' brings a refreshing energy to the music scene with RAYE’s juxtaposition of catchy, upbeat dance tracks with raw, emotional lyrics. With its tracks already trending on platforms like TikTok, the album marks a promising start to RAYE’s independent music career.

In Pamela Anderson’s memoir, “Love, Pamela: A Memoir of Prose, Poetry, and Truth,” she calls herself “an exceptionally easy target.”
With the release of “Pam & Tommy” (2022), a miniseries about the short-lived but eventful relationship between Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, Anderson’s story is once again told by people other than herself. The “dark-comedy” focuses on the theft and release of Anderson and Lee’s sex tape. The experience was life changing and traumatic for Anderson and the creation of the show actually has an eerie parallel to the illegal distribution of their sex tape: Anderson didn’t consent to its release.
The show claims to shine a light on the unfair treatment of Anderson in Hollywood, even before the tape’s release, but the creators of the show are mimicking the behaviors of the predators they’re trying to depict.
In an interview with Deadline, the show’s executive producer, Craig Gillespie said he hoped to bring people’s attention to “what our culture was like back then, and how women were treated, and see the normalcy on talk shows and interviews that as a society, everybody was OK with bizarrely.”
While Pamela and other women were treated horribly throughout the ’80s and ’90s, it is naive to act as if society has evolved to the point where we can consider their treatment a thing of the past — the show being made without Pamela’s permission proves that.
It’s ironic that the one thing the show got right was how disrespected Pamela Anderson has been throughout most of her career, considering they added to the dogpile. Before the tape was released, Anderson was a successful playboy model and globally known actress thanks to her role as CJ Parker on Baywatch. Her rise to icon status mirrored Marilyn Monroe. Like Monroe, people were unable to separate Anderson — the person— from her character — the blonde bombshell known for her iconic slow motion run. She was objectified in interviews with (formerly) respected men like Matt Lauer and Larry King who had no shame asking her whether or not her breasts were real.
“Pam & Tommy” feeds into an unnatural curiosity, providing viewers the opportunity to peer into the private lives of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee as voyeurs. Throughout Pamela’s career, people have felt particularly entitled to her intimate information, and this show invades her privacy just like the people they’re attempting to critique. There’s no shortage of sex scenes between the show’s main characters, but the exposure of Anderson’s body above Lee’s feels egregious. The first time she is seen by herself, Anderson is nearly naked with only a loose tank top. The fact that she did not consent to this show being produced makes these scenes feel particularly disturbing.
The release of the original sex tape didn’t just tarnish her image — it became synonymous with her image, stripping away any public perception of her humanity, which explains why the creators felt entitled to tell her story. But now, with two recently released projects including her memoir, “Love, Pamela: A Memoir of Prose, Poetry, and Truth,” and documentary, “Pamela, A Love Story,” she is finally poised to control her own narrative.
“Pamela, A Love Story” is an inside look into the life of Pamela Anderson. She was encouraged by her sons to “tell [her] story,” and her oldest son Brandon is one of the movie’s producers.
The film begins back on Vancouver Island, where Pamela speaks about her upbringing in Canada, being a tomboy, and growing up doing gymnastics. This autobiographical space also gives Anderson the platform to talk about the sexual assault she experienced during her childhood and teen years, which she considers her first “exposure” to sex. These events impacted her tremendously, contributing to her underlying insecurities and shyness.
Anderson called her shyness a “prison,” one she was locked in due to the cruelty of people around her, but the first photo shoot she did with Playboy gave her confidence. She says in her documentary, “that was the first time I felt like I’d broken free of something.” Her belief that nudity is empowering followed, as it felt like she was reclaiming her own body. Unfortunately, Anderson’s playboy modeling was used against her when she was fighting for her right to privacy in court and essentially, the lawyers told her that since she was in Playboy, she has no right to privacy — as if there is no difference between consensual and non consensual nudity.
In the eyes of the law and now, in the eyes of the creators of “Pam & Tommy,” Anderson’s treatment in Hollywood is a microcosm of the misogyny prevalent in the entertainment industry. She called herself an “exceptionally easy target,” but she is “proud of that,” not having the desire to be “hard, heard, or taken seriously.” And while she should absolutely be proud of her strength and ability to withstand such harsh public scrutiny, it is time for the public to hear her story from her own voice — the only true story.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
Feb 8. was a regular Wednesday night in Boston — predictably windy, reliably cold, eerily quiet in Fenway. Though for the select few who were lucky enough to fill the audience at MGM Music Hall, the night was full of an unpredictable radiance and warmth as Vance Joy stopped by on his “In Our Own Sweet Time” tour.
As one of the first stops on the international tour, the Australian singer-songwriter graced the stage to promote his 2022 album, “In Our Own Sweet Time.”Despite the setlist highlighting his new music, Joy made sure to sprinkle in classic fan favorites — “Saturday Sun,” “Missing Piece,” “Fire and the Flood,” and of course “Riptide” — throughout the setlist.
It’s quite common nowadays for concerts to overstimulate on the audiovisuals — to swell with complicated light displays, costume changes, and background dancers. But not in a Vance Joy concert. Vance Joy stands out in his ability to turn simple melodies into songs that change people, and his concert exemplified his appreciation for simplicity. Between fan favorites, Joy gave fans a glimpse into his musical process, offering an inside look into his life as a songwriter.
During the show, Joy candidly admitted how hard it can be to begin the writing process for a song. Between songs, Joy specifically commented on the creation of “Every Side Of You” and how this song broke him out of a period of writer's block.
“I was watching Sopranos, and not really doing too much. Eventually, I was like, ‘Come on man, you gotta write a song’ and this was the first song that came along” said Joy. “ It gave me a bit of encouragement, got me started writing songs, and finally making this album.”
The rest of the concert highlighted Joy’s musical prowess, as he expertly played his acoustic guitar and ukulele throughout the entire concert. When speaking about his song “Way That I’m Going,” Joy explained that he uses these instruments and surprisingly minimalistic chords to create simple but effective music.
“I always get obsessed with chord progressions. This song is four chords and for about three years I kept playing this same series of chords. I tried to write heaps of songs with these chords and none of them worked. Eventually, the right song came along.”
Much like writers find inspiration from their everyday encounters, Joy preserves the seemingly insignificant, finite moments of life with song. Joy specifically commented on the origin of the lyrics for his song, “I’m With You.”
“I was hanging with my friend and in her house, she had this painting — it’s like this abstract art painting that one of her brothers did,” said Joy. “On the painting, there's this line written into it that says ‘this rain changes everything.’ And I guess when I walk around daily, if someone says something cool or if I see something or read something, I just write it into my phone, and then hopefully later it finds its way into a song”
Joy used this short phrase to create an entire story in his song, “I’m With You,” singing, “We fell asleep to escape from the sun / And we woke up to the sound of a storm outside / You looked at me and said "baby, this rain changes everything" / And my heart ran away from me.”
On stage, Joy’s appreciation for music extended far beyond himself — Joy spent time thanking each band member, carefully timing the announcing of each member’s name during the quietest lulls in the crowd to ensure that every audience member could clap for each individual artist. Trumpet player, Kelly O’Donohue, was one of the most memorable band members, complimenting Joy’s songs effortlessly with floating high notes.
There’s a reason why his last name is Joy. The concert was not only a celebration of the songs that we know and love, but a celebration of the process of creating music itself — tediously testing different chords, listening for the perfect lyric, and collaborating with local artists to create a night radiating with inspiration. Fans left reminded to appreciate life a little more and with a sense of gratitude to Vance Joy for making Boston just a bit brighter on that cold winter night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Sacre,” a performance put on by Circa Contemporary Circus on Feb. 10, provided a unique, modernist perspective on the ways in which Igor Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” can be portrayed both in dance and circus form. The acrobatic performance ran for 65 minutes straight without an intermission at Boch Center Shubert Theatre, creating a sense of continuity throughout the entire performance. The longevity of “Sacre,” however, did not detract attention away from the 10 performers as they still captivated the audience with their impeccable talent and arduous circus training that certainly defied the boundaries of ordinary bodily capabilities.
The blending of movement, dance, theater, and circus throughout “Sacre” left audiences with a glimpse of the potential of circus performances to entertain in traditional theaters. Directed by Yaron Lifschitz, “Sacre” aimed to confront humanity’s inherent sexual desire and relationship with the divine. In order to accomplish this, the Australian company relied on the use of stage lighting to better convey certain artistic choices. The dim lighting used consistently throughout the entire performance led audiences to stare intently at the stage, and especially at whoever occupied the small ring created by the stagelight beams. In fact, there was a moment in the performance in which one of the male dancers was trapped in the limelight of the stage, as his feet refused to move outside the scope of the light. However, this was amended when his female counterpart joined in with backbreaking choreography that allowed him to finally escape.
Surprisingly, the staging of “Sacre” required no necessary props on stage except for the performers themselves. Donned in all black for a uniform presentation, the company was able to reach great heights through the use of one another’s bodies instead of the typical strategy of utilizing safety harnesses. Elegantly climbing onto one another, the circus performers were able to incredibly stack three individuals on top of one another with no external support necessary.
Although there was an emphasis placed on community and interdependence due to the need to use one another’s bodies for circus tricks, individuality was also a central theme throughout the performance. Many of the performers had partially-improvisational solos, where they were able to highlight their own strengths as an acrobat. Furthermore, even in group acts, individuals were oftentimes dancing alone with movements that did not seem to match their neighbors, which created a striking contrast of individuality in group performance.
While the darkness of the stage was constant, the performers’ pace of movements tended to change relative to the tempo of the music. As Stravinsky’s piece heightened to a frenzy with the addition of more orchestral instruments in the score, the performers mirrored the music and incorporated more lifts and body-bending choreography. Furthermore, at simpler times in the “The Rite of Spring” in which there was less input from the entire orchestra, the company moved at a slower pace, opting to utilize those moments to perform arduous lifts that required the lull in the music to be successful.
Circa’s original interpretation of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” spoke to the company’s overall vision of fusing elements of circus performance with traditional performing art forms; namely theater and dance. The redrawn limits of circus acts allowed them to not only rely on stage lighting, but also to understate costuming in order to portray the message of their show. After all, while most circus performances utilize vibrant colors and eccentric costuming to attract attention, the 10 members wore the muted color of black, matching both the flooring of the stage and the sudden darkness around them. As a result, the blending of their bodies with the dark backgrounds made “Sacre” feel more similar to a dance performance — instead of a circus — with the addition of special acrobatic rituals.
“Sacre” ultimately defied the limits of circus performance on stage through jaw-dropping lifts and inflips. The company’s innovative perspective on the world of performing arts through the fusion of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” with modern dance movements left audiences in awe of Circa’s creative and physical mastery.

Grace Lin and Kate Messner have collaborated to tell a modern folktale.
Caldecott and Newbery Honoree Grace Lin and bestselling author Kate Messner released “Once Upon a Book” on Feb. 7, a vibrantly illustrated story following a young girl as she explores the wonders inside of her book.
The idea for the book was developed in 2019, when Lin was asked to create a collaborative poster for the 100th anniversary of Children’s Book Week. She ultimately loved the illustration so much that she almost wanted to set aside her other deadlines to make it into a full book.
“I had so many other projects that I was working on though, and I didn't have the time or the mental bandwidth to think of a story,” Lin said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “So I was like, ‘I'll do a Hail Mary!’” The author posted the painting in an online writers’ group, requesting ideas to turn her illustration into a full story.
This Hail Mary was answered by Kate Messner. Messner, taking a quick break from working on her own pressing deadlines, was scrolling on social media when she came across Lin’s post.
“I saw this art and I was absolutely in love with it. The piece just spoke to me,” Messner said. “So I set a timer and I took ten minutes to write in my writer’s notebook.” Those ten minutes set into motion a long collaboration between the authors, as they spent the next several months drafting and redrafting what would then blossom into “Once Upon a Book.”
The result is a story within a story — a modern folktale of different worlds with an overarching narrative that follows protagonist Alice as she navigates her own quest for home within them. Inside these tales is an additional throughline, shown by the white rabbit hiding on every well-illustrated page, reminding older readers of the protagonist’s namesake: “Alice in Wonderland.”
Despite creating such a cohesive story, the pair of authors still noted their distinct personal philosophies when approaching their work.
“My driving force in writing for kids is curiosity,” Messner said. “As a kid, I escaped at the library. There, I could read anything and I could go anywhere. It's all about curiosity and wonder.”
Lin, however, seeks to give her young readers stories that allow them to see their personal identities represented inside her books.
“I want to create books that give kids a sense of home, a sense of welcome, a sense of warmth,” Lin said, recalling her childhood search for protagonists that resembled her as an Asian-American girl. “I escaped into books to try to find a sense of belonging.”
In “Once Upon a Book,” the authors intertwined their missions, melding their values into a nuanced story. Demonstrating both curiosity and home-seeking, protagonist Alice experiences a grand, otherworldly adventure, yet still makes it back to her kitchen table for dinner by the end of the book.
“There’s the curiosity and the escape into fantasies,” Lin said, reflecting on how her mission combined with Messner’s. “But there’s also the message that you’re safe, you’re home. Home is waiting for you and you belong.”
Reflecting on their own personal journey as writers, Messner and Lin each left a piece of parting wisdom for writers and artists.
“Read and read and read. If you want to write children's mysteries, read 100 children's mysteries. If you want to write picture books, read 500 recently published picture books,” Messner said. “There’s no real education like consuming what's out there. You’ll learn a lot about the music of language.”
Lin nodded to Messner’s point, adding her own profound advice.
“Learn to hold humility and audacity in the same hand,” Lin said. “To be a writer, you have to have the audacity to believe that what you are doing is important. But you also have to be able to hold the humility to hear what people are saying about your writing and know that no writer is perfect. To hold those two things in one hand is very, very difficult. But when you do, that's when you become a successful writer.”
With “Once Upon a Book,” Lin and Messner have successfully balanced audacity and humility to tell a beautiful story rife with complexity. By collaborating, the authors have given young readers a book that represents their own deep connection with storytelling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What is the line between innocent fascination and obsessive stalking? Between daydream and delusion? And how do you know if you’ve crossed the line? These are some of the questions posed by Maria Dong’s ambitious debut novel, “Liar, Dreamer, Thief.” The refreshingly unreliable narrator, Katrina Kim, is an unfulfilled temp worker whose life is consumed by an unexplained obsession with her mysterious co-worker Kurt. When Katrina finds a cryptic postcard addressed to her while snooping through Kurt’s desk only to witness him jump off a bridge later that night, she assumes the role of amateur investigator to uncover the circumstances leading to Kurt’s apparent suicide. Her search for the truth forces Katrina to confront her obsessive-compulsive tendencies, her episodes of psychosis disguised as escapism, and the reason she estranged herself from her family six years ago. More emotionally raw than your average thriller, this page-turner delves into weighty topics and is sure to keep readers captivated — but only if they’re willing to suspend their disbelief through major plot jumps and inconsistencies.
During her hallucinatory episodes, Katrina enters “the kitchen door world,” a fictional setting borrowed from her favorite storybook, “Mi-Hee and the Mirror-Man.” The kitchen door world is populated with analogues of people and places from Katrina’s real life: Her roommate Leoni is a unicorn, the apartment building super is a sailor/pirate complete with “peg leg and sabers criss crossed behind his back,” and the Cayatona bridge where Katrina sees Kurt jump is the the “Heart” of the kitchen door world, where she goes to fully enter into her fantasy. Just as Katrina’s hallucinations trap her within a world of her own creation, the plotline of “Liar, Dreamer, Thief” is hampered by excessive story-within-a-story references. Though some of these allusions are central to the action, the fictional reference material is not fleshed out enough to seamlessly integrate into the story. Some plot points are left feeling too far-fetched and the prose occasionally reads as choppy.
When she can’t escape to the kitchen door world, the ever-paranoid Katrina draws overlapping stellations of endekagrams in the air with her finger as a protective sigil. These confusingly impressive shapes are explained — in excruciating arithmetic detail — a quarter of the way through the story, narrating that “each point inside forms an angle of 147 and 3/11 degrees, and 3/11 is one of those fractions that just stretches off after the decimal forever.” Descriptions like these serve only to hyperfixate on the author’s mathematical competency while taking precious space away from much-needed character and plot development. Katrina’s internal monologue offers us little other than basic surface descriptions of the other characters in the story. This lack of character development makes the slurry of plot twists that ensue unbelievable and thinly woven.
Occasionally verging on fantasy, “Liar, Dreamer, Thief” ultimately remains rooted in realism; the more fantastical aspects of this psychological thriller are rationalized by the unreliable narrator’s mental instability. Through the character of Katrina Kim, Dong accomplishes a challenging feat: Writing about mental illness without romanticizing what can be a debilitating and deadly disease. Katrina’s relationship to the evident — though undiagnosed — obsessive compulsive disorder ruling her life is nuanced and sincere. She is not helpless, nor is she naive enough to deny the unhealthy extent of her obsessive stalking and counting rituals. She knows that every voyage into the kitchen door world, every psychotic episode, is a warning sign of her crumbling sanity, but she rationalizes the destructive coping mechanism.
“Sometimes the poison is part of the cure, and once I’m finished here, safe time will start. I’ll be anchored in the real world again, and not just for a moment. I’ll once again be in control,” Katrina reasons.
Like the variations of endekagrams that prelude each section, “Liar, Dreamer, Thief” starts out slowly, moving forward in uneven spurts with the majority of the action weighted toward the end. A redistribution of plot-to-exposition ratio would give Dong’s resonant prose and intricate storytelling the support it deserves, and rocket “Liar, Dreamer, Thief” to the top of every literary thrillseeker’s reading list.

“This Is How You Lose the Time War” by Amal El-Mohtar & Max Gladstone
The epic love story in Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone’s sci-fi novella “This is How You Lose the Time War” truly transcends time. Time travelers Red and Blue are soldiers on opposite sides of a war for control of the world’s timeline. They begin the story as bitter enemies, leaving letters scattered throughout history — written in a poisoned flower, or in the rings of an ancient tree — to taunt the other about their failures. But over the course of the novella’s 200 pages, Red and Blue’s letters slowly turn from rivalry to love. Entirely written through these letters, El-Mohtar and Gladstone have crafted a heartbreaking, sapphic, enemies-to-lovers romance that traverses space and time.

“Six of Crows” by Leigh Bardugo
Leigh Bardugo is a master of crafting fantasy, and while all aspects of “Six of Crows” shine, the romance is truly exceptional. The six characters are all embroiled in relationships with each other, and while these pairings run the risk of being cliché, each pairing is so well-developed, nuanced, and satisfying that they are all deliciously romantic — and Kaz and Inej reign supreme. Kaz Brekker is a hardened genius criminal, his cane and black gloves that he wears at all times remain his armor against the world; Inej Ghafa is an acrobat who was freed by Kaz after being trafficked and sold to a brothel and has since become his silent spy and most loyal assassin. In their city full of con artists and crime rings, Kaz and Inej not only understand each other like no one else does but are utterly dependent on each other for advice and support. And yet, their relationship is uniquely beautiful due to the incredible restraint Bardugo exercises in bringing them together. Both have intense trauma related to physical touch, so even as both characters feel insatiable desire and affection for each other, their dark pasts prevent them from ever truly being physically intimate even as their emotional bond grows until they cannot bear to see the other in danger. Their love for each other endows both characters with more humanity, which both characters (but especially Kaz) initially reject because in a world where greed and deceit are what rule, compassion is a weakness — and yet a “weakness” that they both inevitably succumb to.

“A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara
This is not a romance novel. This is a hymn to friendship, to brotherhood, to grief. It’s a story of horrible trauma and horrible love — of agony and of pleasure. In 720 pages, we follow Malcolm, JB, Willem, and Jude — my poor Jude — as they learn to cope with the tragedies of life. They learn that to be human is to be broken. That sometimes, love is not enough. That not all damage can be healed. But most importantly, they learn that a little life — a little love — is better than none at all.

“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid
As someone who doesn’t typically read YA fiction, it can be hard to find queer love stories that I enjoy. “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid, however, had me enthralled. Set in 1950s Hollywood, this fast-paced novel is told through an interview with former actress Evelyn Hugo, who tells the story of — you guessed it — her seven husbands. But beneath the comings and goings of men exists Hugo's heart-wrenching, passionate relationship with fellow star Celia St. James. If you enjoy the rich language of classic fiction yet seek stories of love between women, this one’s for you!

“Every Summer After” by Carley Fortune
Carley Fortune depicts a love story — one so endearing but also heartbreaking — that captivates readers from the very first chapter. From childhood friends to lovers and then strangers, Sam and Percy struggle to realize that they complete one another. From the moment Sam met Percy, an undeniable connection tied them together both literally and figuratively through their shared woven bracelets. Their friendship began when she made Sam a matching bracelet, which was a mutual reminder to keep their promises. Although the years passed, Sam never took it off as he hoped he would see her again. This story is about second chances and the journey it takes you on may lead you to discover that perhaps what you needed most was always right in front of you. This is my favorite romance novel. It breaks your heart and puts it back together again. Filled with warm memories on the lake and flashbacks of the main characters’ childhoods, you will not be able to put this book down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From school board meetings to the halls of Congress, debates over what children should be allowed to read has become rampant. Buzz phrases such as “critical race theory” circulate on Twitter daily, and book bans are increasingly common.
Nonetheless, on Jan. 31, acclaimed authors Ibram X. Kendi and Nic Stone published “How to Be a (Young) Antiracist.” This young-adult spinoff of Kendi’s 2019 bestseller “How to Be an Antiracist” hit shelves just days after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a statewide ban on the newly developed AP African American History Course, and shortly before teachers in Manatee County Florida received a directive to shroud their bookshelves of material that could violate the parameters of Florida’s “Stop WOKE Act” and thus incriminate teachers.
The same week that these headlines made their way across the country, so did Kendi and Stone, who traveled to red and blue states for their “How to Be A (Young) Antiracist” book tour. From Texas to California, the authors and their publisher, Penguin Teen, collaborated with independent bookstores to host moderated panel discussions for fans of all ages.
The tour’s final stop was right here in Cambridge, in partnership with Porter Square Books and Cambridge Public Schools. As the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and the Founding Director of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research, Kendi remarked over the applause of local fans that he was “excited to be able to end this tour here at home.” Held at Temple Beth Shalom in Central Square, pews were packed for the entirely sold-out event, which was moderated by a Cambridge Rindge and Latin School senior.
Narrated by Nic Stone, “How to Be a (Young) Antiracist” offers a fictional retelling of Kendi’s life and experiences with racism. It creatively starts and ends with the story of Kendi’s speech for an MLK Oratorical contest in the year 2000. Written as a prophecy to an older Kendi, the book begins by criticizing his very own speech. As stated by Nic Stone during the event, young Kendi “spout[ed] a series of racist ideas… with bounding applause in the audience.” Stone then proceeds to use an array of stories from Kendi’s youth to introduce anti-racist concepts and definitions to young readers. Ultimately, the book ends with a letter to Stone from a 17-year-old Kendi, who finds “How to Be a (Young) Antiracist” on his bookshelf on the eve of his speech. He then rewrites his speech with the help of her insight, exemplifying the influence of this book.
This unique second-person, non-sequential narration was of great interest to the audience, who learned that Stone chose to start the book with the story of 17-year-old Kendi’s failure because she “wants young people to see that even a McArthur Genius… came through a period of time where even he had some racist ideas” which is meant “to set a young reader up to see that… [Kendi] is just like [you].”
Though the book was written with young readers in mind, it goes without saying that many young people choose to spend their free time scrolling rather than reading. This was not lost on the authors, who spoke at length about their vision for the project.
“When I write books,” Stone explained, “the goal for me is to break focus because it is a way to keep young eyes […] engaged on what [they're] looking at.”
Breaking the fourth wall, Stone sprinkles post-it note style “Nic’s Notes” throughout the book, which provide narrative-breaking commentary on aspects of the story.
When asked about their use, Stone remarked that “they are designed to drag readers’ eyes away from the text […] because the audience has grown up with Instagram.”
Beyond the process of writing, audience members were interested to hear about the significance of a book that details controversial material. Spurred by the high school student moderator’s question about the importance of this work, Stone shared that anti-racism rejects all ideas that place one group over another: “Seeing everything as equally valuable has opened me up to so many other people that I may or may not have started a conversation with” Stone reflected.
Yet both authors still recognized the challenge of writing about anti-racism. When asked what drives his writing, Kendi shared that he stays motivated “knowing that there are many people in this country who can’t tap out of being harmed by racism.”
As stated by Stone, “we all have the space to do hard things and live softly.” It’s this philosophy that is at the very core of “How to Be a (Young) Antiracist” — a piece of literature and movement that successfully and gently introduces topics of anti-racism to the next generation.

You can listen along to all of these tracks on The Crimson’s Official Valentine’s Day playlist.
Valentine’s Day is approaching and the Hallmark holiday can feel different for everyone. Whether you’ll be celebrating in the arms of someone you love or having a party all to yourself, music is a great way to process whatever emotions have been buried for the past 364 days. For all of your Valentine’s Day needs, check out these 10 songs.
1. For the one you had to leave during break: “I Miss You (feat. Teddy Pendergrass)” by Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes
This eight-minute ballad is an automatic tearjerker. The late Teddy Pendergrass’s deep and soulful voice tells the story of a broken up couple and their struggle for reconciliation.
2. For a day of overthinking: “A Dream with a Baseball Player” by Faye Webster
Faye Webster’s entire discography could work for this list, but this jazz and indie pop fusion begs the age old question: “How did I fall in love with someone I don’t know?”
3. For when they try to “Happy Valentine’s Day” their way back into your life: “Talk Show” by TWENTY88
Jhene Aiko and Big Sean have historically provided tracks that offer a raw perspective on the complexities of love, but this track is their strongest. The two go back and forth arguing about which one is the worse partner through rap and spoken word, accompanied with soaring wind instruments and cheeky audience reactions.
4. For when you realize they were never right for you: “You Sent Me Flying/Cherry” by Amy Whinehouse
Tackling the pain of falling in love with an older man, Whinehouse takes listeners through the stages of realizing who someone really is. As an added plus, the song smoothly transitions into a more playful love song about her guitar.
5. For a Galentine’s Day anthem: “oh my love” by FKA Twigs
FKA Twigs’s raw approach to the frustration of the talking stage of a relationship creates a perfect bop for when it’s time to remember that life is beautiful with or without a romantic interest. She hypes herself up while rejecting the shortcomings of her crush, with an upbeat bass and chorus perfect for a dance party.
6. For a celebration of your first year as someone’s Valentine: “Kiss of Life” by Sade
Love birds will definitely appreciate the sensuality of Sade’s music, and this classic love song is nothing short of perfection.
7. For when you think your FWB could be more: “She Lives In My Lap (feat. Rosario Dawson)” by Outkast
While definitely the most experimental on this list, the creative genius of André 3000 and Big Boi is not to be ignored. Similar to “Talk Show,” actress Rosario Dawson joins the track to add a female perspective to the duo’s funk-filled track.
8. For the secret love bird: “Nothing Even Matters (feat. D’Angelo)” by Lauryn Hill
Music fans looking for a lowkey love song know that Lauryn Hill has some of the most captivating R&B and rap records for when you’re in your feelings. Hill and D’Angelo sing with palpable intimacy while avoiding the often overtly sexual lyrics found in their respective genres.
9. For when you’re getting ready to groove: “Beauty & Essex (feat. Daniel Caesar & Unknown Mortal Orchestra) by Free Nationals
In contrast to “Nothing Even Matters” Caesar’s lyrics paint a picture of love very clearly. The 70’s inspired track will have listeners ready to call up their crush immediately.
10. For when you’re just trying to make it work: “Green Eyes” by Erykah Badu
A stunning 10-minute record, Badu uses her eccentric voice and storytelling abilities to take listeners through the end of a relationship and the lessons learned in the process. Her NPR Tiny Desk concert makes the stylistic shifts throughout the song even more powerful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, my parents always told me caffeine was bad for you.
“It stunts your growth,” they’d say, citing my older brother as an example.
As someone who binged soda and didn’t budge past 4 feet, 10 inches throughout middle school, my brother was the perfect fodder for my parents’ rules. But seeing as he is now 6 feet tall and his craving for Coca-Cola has not abated, I’ve become suspicious of my parents’ theory — can caffeine really be all that terrible for you?
My questions only increased with the start of the school year, after Harvard Student Agencies delivered a four-pack of Red Bull to our dormitories during my first week on campus. Here was an energy drink that I had always thought of as poison being offered openly and institutionally.
Yet this was not an isolated occurrence; caffeine seems pervasive at Harvard. In my 10:30 a.m. class, at least three to four students around me sip coffee or tea on a regular basis. I have seen more flavors of Red Bull in one class than I ever did growing up (yes, there’s more than just a blue can), and I’ve even overheard discussions about caffeine pills.
What Harvard students may fail to realize, however, is that caffeine is a drug. More specifically, it is a drug that is well absorbed by our bodies, with the ability to mimic the shape and form of adenosine, a sleep-inducing neurotransmitter in our brains. Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors and prevents the neurotransmitter from producing its effects, which not only promotes excitatory neuron-firing but also stimulates our brain’s reward centers with dopamine, the pleasure juice. Opiates, cocaine, and alcohol are all drugs that can increase dopamine levels in our brains and bring about pleasure-seeking cravings similar to those associated with caffeine.
As interesting as this may be, I seriously doubt that anyone is thinking about the neurochemistry behind boosting their dopamine levels when enjoying their morning cup of joe.
A morning cup of caffeine in the form of tea or coffee is a habit that has become ingrained in American society. Take the Massachusetts-based company Dunkin Donuts, whose slogan “America Runs on Dunkin” perfectly embodies the idea that coffee fuels us throughout the day.
Coffee is central to student meetings, dates, and studying — to the point that some libraries, like Cabot Science Library, boast a café to attract students. The coffee industry nets billions of dollars in yearly profit, and the average American spends more than a thousand dollars on coffee each year. It is truly the most popular drug in the country.
But why is there such a nationwide reliance on caffeine? Although consuming it in small doses can boost your spirits or energy levels, higher doses of caffeine, like any stimulating drug, can be addictive.
As we drink more and more coffee, for example, we need higher and higher doses to reach similar levels of wakefulness, which could lead to a phenomenon known as tolerance that in the end might prove deleterious. Tolerance explains why, with time, a morning cup of coffee just doesn’t do the trick, and a midday Starbucks run becomes an absolute necessity. With time, your body becomes caffeine-dependent. Levels of excitatory neurotransmitters like norepinephrine fall, and your body begins to rely on caffeine for that excitatory high.
This is where caffeine can get dangerous. Drinking more than the recommended 400mg of caffeine per day — equivalent to four cups of a standard coffee or approximately two “energy shot” drinks — may lead to health issues. In the short term, caffeine consumption can cause insomnia and anxiety. And over the long term, although it is unlikely to stunt your growth (much to the chagrin of my parents), it can lead to digestive issues, dehydration, and heightened blood pressure.
As a student, the appeal of caffeine makes sense: drink a cup of coffee or an energy drink, gain some extra energy, and potentially have a few more hours of productivity. This bargain seems great — and it’s probably at least part of the reason why coffee was initially used. A popular origin story mentions an Ethiopian herder who saw his flock of sheep “dancing” after ingesting coffee beans. He subsequently shared the beans with a monk, who used them to maintain his attention for late-night prayers.
In other words, according to this legend, monks used caffeine to pull all-nighters — and if this usage is applicable to monks, it surely is applicable to zealous college students.
But, alas, drinking caffeine to delay sleep can be dangerous. We essentially end up cheating our bodies out of the rest and recuperation needed to be alert and productive. Caffeine brings pseudo-happiness to our brain, even though the rest of our body may be saying otherwise.
It is difficult to tell people to stop consuming caffeine. Even if it doesn’t seem to have many immediate effects, just the placebo anticipation of an energy high can make drinking a caffeinated beverage worth it.
So, here’s my takeaway: Like anything in life, caffeine consumption is quite alright in moderation. Science tells us that extremes like taking caffeine pills to stay awake or chugging energy drinks are probably not going to do you any good in the long run, but a Mocha Frappuccino every once in a while might actually be uplifting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This love poem is inspired by the great Phillis Wheatley, the first published Black poet in America. Wheatley was a child when she was taken from her home in West Africa to Boston. She won her freedom in the fall of 1773, and continued to write beautiful poetry until her death 11 years later.
To appreciate in awe the divine gift,
That is expressed with delicate stitch.
One must inhale the air of the heavens,
Before giving breath to an angel's work.
Weeping trees bring blistering cold,
Just as an artist extracts beauty.
There’s shouts and roars from
Students and statesmen.
The curtain closes on a woman’s glory.
The designer’s eyes marry constellations,
dreaming of more fabrics to tailor.
I have been fashioned for immortal fame,
By embracing with gentle lips.
The needle and the pen are one
They converse with steady hands,
Moving through Black hair.
Laying on the earth I wonder,
Will our fates remain intact?
Sometimes birds are too young
Corrupted by green grass and blue skies.
So I pray for a storm!
To wreak havoc on the imagination;
To stress the fabric of this unity.
And while our eyes are watching God,
I hope Janie will look to me for comfort.
In the aftermath of brutal war,
Church bells will sing spring melodies
And hands are tied together forever.
A heart is only an ego disguised as muscle
Ready to be flexed at every turn.
Yet, my chest has been humbled
I give my soul to her.

On this Valentine’s Day, as love lingers in the air, the scent of pink flowers pervades the aisles of CVS, and students rejoice after finally receiving their Datamatch picks, Harvard’s non-tenured faculty are gathering on campus to sign a special kind of Valentine’s Day card — a union authorization card.
On February 6, the Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers announced a public card campaign in pursuit of official union recognition for non-tenure track workers. Their goal? Address long standing grievances related to precarious job security, rising costs of living, inequalities in childcare support, lackluster protections for international workers, and feeble measures against workplace harassment and discrimination.
If they succeed, the union plans to bargain on behalf of non-tenure track faculty and researchers, including postdocs, research associates, lecturers, preceptors, teaching assistants, and others, who all share an eight-year cap on their employment.
The grievances laid out by HAW-UAW are both sound and pressing. As Cambridge rent sours and wages fail to keep pace with crushing inflation, organizers say the yearly salaries of some academic workers remain less than $50,000 in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $2,700 — eating away well over half of an annual paycheck.
These stagnant wages are incomprehensible at the richest institution of higher learning in the United States. The University’s spending budget (which somehow includes artisan lawn chairs costing well-over $300) should certainly be able to include liveable salaries for some of its most impactful workers, who shape the academic trajectories of undergraduates from first-year Expository Writing all the way to upper-level concentration requirements — and are thus central to the mission of a university that prides itself not only on research, but on transformative teaching.
Unacceptable, too, is the precarity Harvard’s non-tenure track workers are subjected to. No non-tenured faculty member should have to fear a last-minute change to their employment contract, which the University has recently shown itself capable of enacting even in the case of high-profile researchers. A researcher’s lack of tenure should never be used to forcibly shut down cutting-edge work or initiatives, and the threat of dismissal should not stifle academic freedom.
These legitimate concerns can be addressed through unionization, a process that allows employees to collectively bargain for better working conditions and is generally associated with increases in wages and benefits across industries.
Unionization may also help to empower voices that have historically been barred from academia. Faculty of color occupy a higher percentage of non-tenure track than tenured positions, reflecting an opaque tenure process that we’ve been critical of in the past. We hope that unionization will counter any currents of exclusion and marginalization that may exist at Harvard and give underrepresented faculty more power in the workplace.
For these reasons, and all others named by HAW-UAW organizers, we call on Harvard to voluntarily recognize the union.
For students and members of the Harvard community not directly engaged in the unionization drive, we urge you to get involved. Show your support by attending a rally like those happening today at the Cambridge and Longwood campuses. Reach out and have a conversation with academic workers about their workplace conditions. Most importantly, spread the word. Student support for other unions within this University has helped to amplify their voices in the past; we should not hesitate to express appreciation for the workers who have contributed so immeasurably to our time at Harvard.
To our non-tenured faculty: We stand behind you. Labor deserves love too.

Whether organically or through the multi-billion dollar commercial complex that feasts on a paper-heart production of love, Valentine’s Day is an opportunity to reflect on why we love, who we love, and what keeps us loving. In honor of the occasion, we asked the Editorial Board — hopeless romantics and cynical curmudgeons alike — to reflect on the loves in their lives this semester.
I didn’t expect to enjoy a three-hour laboratory section at 9 a.m. on Friday, but thanks to my rekindled love for pipetting and the silly crocs by the front door (reserved for those who have forgotten their closed-toe shoes), I’m actually finding myself looking forward to it. My sleep cycle, however, does not share this rapture.

For the first time in my math-concentrator life, I enrolled in a literature course; now, reading Anna Karenina every night has become an escape — if not an addiction. Lying in bed in my plain Lowell room I am transported across centuries and continents to the streets of St. Petersburg, the farms in Russia’s countryside, the balls of Moscow. For some the novel’s 800 pages is too long; I just wish it would read on for 800 more.

Brief interludes of sunshine amidst the harsh winds of February have stolen my heart this year. The chance to be one with the Sun as I scurry across campus for classes, meals with friends, and a cozy library to curl up in has never been so enlivening. I hope Valentine’s Day brings with it more light, warmth, and sunshine for us to relish in during this season of love.

Each year, the changing of The Crimson’s guard brings together a new constellation of executives to write, edit, and proof our content. Grizzled by my previous term on the Editorial Chair job, I thought I’d be earth-bound, already acclimatized to the more mundane logistics of nightly production. But while reviewing pieces in the evenings, I’ve found myself enchanted by the luminous fingerprints that each editor leaves behind — their idiosyncratic tendencies towards petite paragraphs or abundant em-dashes, avant-garde adjectives or witty conclusions. These bits of stardust brighten my midnights, reminding me again and again that the magic of 14p is something that never fades.

Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy David M. Turk discussed the federal government’s plans to foster the transition to clean energy at a Monday seminar held by the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
President Joe Biden has set ambitious clean energy goals for the United States, including reaching 100 percent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions in the overall economy by 2050. At the event, Turk discussed the motivation behind these commitments and DOE efforts to tackle the clean energy goals with technology.
“These goals actually come straight from the science — straight from all the science that’s been done for many, many years, saying, how do we avoid the worst consequences of climate change?” Turk said.
Turk elaborated on the reasoning behind the clean energy goals, including national security concerns and the high cost of climate change to the U.S. economy. In 2022, extreme weather in the U.S. caused a total of $165 billion of damages.
Citing the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, Turk said transitioning to clean energy also comes with “inherent national security benefits.”
“It’s relatively easy for Putin to turn off the spigot on natural gas flowing from Russia and to Europe,” he said. “It’s more challenging for him to put a big solar shield over Europe or to stop the wind from blowing from offshore wind and onshore wind.”
Turk also outlined the department’s plans for tackling the clean energy goals with technology in three categories, which he dubbed “technology on hand,” “technology on the cusp,” and “technology on the horizon.”
“Technology on hand” includes cost-competitive technologies that the federal government hopes to rapidly integrate into the economy, such as at-home solar power and electric vehicles, Turk said. The DOE also funds “technology on the cusp,” according to Turk, including “cutting-edge companies” on the cusp of commercialization.
Referring to “technology on the horizon,” Turk described government progress on fusion energy technologies, citing a recent breakthrough reported last December, in which a laboratory fusion reaction produced more energy than it took in.
“We got more energy out than we put in,” he said. “That is a big deal. We’re not there to commercialize fusion yet. We’ve got a lot of work to do on that front, but this is the kind of investment the U.S. has made for years and years — the kind of investment in my opinion, we need to keep making going forward.”
Turk said the pace of the transition to clean energy will have wide-ranging consequences.
“Climate change is riding on that — whether we're successful or not on that front — but there's an awful lot more,” he said. “U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, environmental justice, energy justice — there's an awful lot riding on how quickly, how successful this transition is going to be.

The Harvard Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability announced grants to five research groups featuring 30 faculty members from across the University on Monday, marking the first projects funded by the Salata Institute since its establishment in fall 2022.
The research groups, part of the newly-established Climate Research Clusters program at the Salata Institute, include faculty members from eight of Harvard’s schools, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard Business School.
“All of these projects are focused on having real-world constructive impact in terms of moving forward — real world problems associated with climate change,” said Salata Institute Director James H. Stock, who also serves as Harvard’s vice provost for climate and sustainability.
Two projects focus on cutting greenhouse gas emissions: one by reducing global methane emissions and the other by examining corporate net-zero pledges. Another two projects study the negative consequences of climate change in specific regions of the world, and the last studies the impact of a clean energy transition on areas of the United States dependent on the extraction of fossil fuels.
In selecting the research groups, the institute required all teams to work across different Harvard schools and considered the project’s potential for innovation and real-world impact, according to Stock.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Robert N. Stavins, the lead researcher of the project studying methane emissions, lauded the Salata Institute for fostering research collaborations at the University. Stavins said tackling climate change requires interdisciplinary research and collaboration with faculty from other disciplines.
“What the Salata Institute is doing, which is very significant in the long history of Harvard University, is that they’re bringing together faculty, absolutely across the university, to work together on climate change and other problems of sustainability,” he said. “That’s a remarkable development.”
Carrie F. Jenks, executive director of the HLS Environmental and Energy Law Program and a member of the research cluster evaluating corporate net-zero projects, said her research relies heavily on perspectives from other disciplines.
“From a legal perspective, we work on regulations, for example, at EPA,” she said. “We’re always looking to other experts to build a regulatory record, whether that be energy market experts or public health experts or climate change experts or engineers thinking about what technologies can you use to control greenhouse gasses.”
The research that the clusters produce aims to produce practical solutions for climate problems and inform policy decisions. Stock emphasized the importance of engaging with all stakeholders affected by climate change in developing climate solutions.
Three projects will conduct research in local areas impacted by climate change, including two examining climate adaptation in the Gulf of Guinea and South Asia, respectively.
“Working closely with local communities so that there’s an enduring and constructive engagement, and allowing Harvard to contribute in areas where it has strengths — but making sure that it’s done in a way that really works for the local communities — is incredibly important,” Stock said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty women made sweeping allegations of sexual assault in a lawsuit against James L. Toback ’66 and the Harvard Club of New York City late last year, alleging Toback repeatedly used his membership at the private alumni venue to abuse five of the plaintiffs.
The suit was filed in New York State Supreme Court on Dec. 5, just days after the Adult Survivors Act created a one-year window for survivors of sexual assault in the state to bring civil lawsuits against their abusers and other parties that enabled the abuse.
Toback, a 78-year-old filmmaker and Oscar-nominated screenwriter, faced accusations of sexual assault and abuse from 38 women in the initial lawsuit. Lawyers filed an amended complaint on Dec. 16, bringing the total number of plaintiffs accusing Toback to 40.
Toback, a former Crimson editor, is accused in the lawsuit of taking advantage of his membership in the Harvard Club of New York City to sexually abuse women by “luring his victims to the Harvard Club for meals and drinks and attacking them in the Harvard Club’s dining room, stairwells, bathrooms and hotel rooms.”
“Toback also frequently used hotel rooms, including his private room, at the Harvard Club to falsely imprison and sexually abuse his victims,” the lawsuit stated.
The lawsuit seeks to hold the Club accountable for negligence, claiming it allowed Toback’s “serial sexual abuse to occur unchecked at the Harvard Club for decades.”
The lawsuit comes five years after the Los Angeles Times published an investigation in which 38 women accused Toback of sexual harassment over several decades. Toback denied the allegations at the time, claiming that for 22 years he was “biologically incapable” of the behavior alleged by the women because he had diabetes and a heart condition.
Toback did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
A spokesperson for the Harvard Club of New York City provided a letter to The Crimson that the Club’s leadership sent to its members in December.
The letter stated that “as is the Club’s policy, we do not comment on pending litigation.”
Allegations of sexual harassment against Toback involving the Harvard Club of New York City were first reported as early as 1989 in the now-defunct Spy Magazine, according to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit alleges that the Harvard Club of New York was previously informed about Toback’s misconduct and launched an investigation into his behavior, but did not complete the investigation because Toback threatened the Club with legal action.
“The Harvard Club valued Toback’s membership more than the lives of the young women Toback sexually assaulted on its premises,” the lawsuit stated.
When the Club learned about the allegations against Toback in fall 2017, it conducted an internal investigation and Toback’s membership was “promptly terminated by the Club’s Board,” wrote Harvard Club of New York City President James D. Coady ’92, First Vice President Stephen P. Younger ’77, and Secretary Angela K. Dorn ’87 in the December letter.
“At that time, the incidents reportedly occurred in the 1980s and in 2012, and as was noted in a press article, the women did not inform Club management at the time,” the Club’s leadership wrote in the letter.
Ross E. Leonoudakis, a lawyer at Nix Patterson — the firm that is representing the plaintiffs — said that women who decided to speak out against Toback in 2017 had no method of legal recourse until the passage of the Adult Survivors Act.
“There’s typically a situation where plaintiffs delay reporting, or do not report being sexually assaulted at all, for a number of reasons: shame, embarrassment, but also fear of retaliation,” Leonoudakis said.
“With the Adult Survivors Act, for the first time, the plaintiffs in this case — and many survivors of sexual assault throughout the state of New York — have an opportunity to seek justice and to be heard,” Leonoudakis added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A coalition of Cambridge students and activists held a rally on the steps of Cambridge City Hall Monday in the tenth Boston-area protest against the police killing of Sayed Faisal in just over a month.
The protest culminated in a nearly 1.5-mile march to Cambridge Police Headquarters.
Faisal, a 20-year-old Cambridge resident and University of Massachusetts Boston student, was shot and killed by a Cambridge Police Department officer after he allegedly approached officers while wielding a knife following a five-block foot chase through Cambridgeport.
The killing of Faisal by CPD has raised allegations of racism and police brutality, sparking protests throughout the city and internationally, including at least five at City Hall.
Activists from the Party for Socialism and Liberation, who organized the protest, reiterated demands for the officers involved in the shooting to be named, fired, and prosecuted.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick declined to comment.
The names of the officers will be released following the conclusion of the Middlesex District Attorney’s investigation into the shooting.
After protesters read the demands at Cambridge City Hall, more than 100 took control of Massachusetts Ave., Vassar Street, and Broadway en route to police headquarters. As volunteers in neon orange vests on bicycles redirected traffic, four CPD motorcycles and two cars accompanied the crowd.
Chants of “Justice for Faisal! Justice for Tyre! Justice for everyone killed by the police!” and “No good cop in a racist system!” filled the night air, with passing cars honking in support.
Throughout the rallies at City Hall and police headquarters, protesters circulated a petition by MIT students in support of the protesters’ demands.
“We call on students from universities all around the Boston area to join us in this fight,” the petition reads. “We must show the Cambridge City Council that thousands of students are united in the fight to win justice for Faisal and all victims of police brutality!”
Students from MIT, UMass Boston, Harvard, and other Boston-area schools attended the rally.
Jeffrey J. Shen, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation and a student at MIT, said he hopes student organizing will lead to a change in city policies.
“When we organize in our classrooms, on our campuses, in our student groups, there is nothing Cambridge can do to stop us,” he said.
In an interview, Rafeya V. Raquib, a student at Boston University and organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said the party plans to continue organizing among Boston students.
“We really wanted to get students out here, get them organized, get them energized to really fight for something that affects them,” Raquib said.
Jack Pierce, a student at the University of Massachusetts Boston — which Faisal attended — said the school has “a history of fighting back against the racist police,” referencing students’ participation in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests against the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin.
Shen told The Crimson that Faisal’s killing resonated with students partly because the shooting occurred near MIT’s campus.
“This matters a lot to us as students because Faisal was killed just a few blocks from MIT. It could have literally been any MIT student,” he said.
“Our communities don’t feel safe with the police killing with impunity,” Raquib said at the rally.

Woman Injured by Falling Equipment at Harvard Square T Station
Hundreds of Harvard affiliates signed an open letter asking for the University to raise awareness to earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria last week, killing tens of thousands of people in the regions.
The letter, addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, has received more than 650 signatures as of Monday night. Written by a group of Turkish Harvard students, alumni, and faculty, the letter calls on the University to raise awareness to the crisis through the Harvard Alumni Association and through social media and publications.
More than 36,000 people have died after a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Turkey and Syria on Feb. 6, and tens of thousands are injured. In the days following the earthquakes, undergraduates from the Harvard College Turkish Student Association and Harvard Society of Arab Students raised more than $30,000 in donations for earthquake relief efforts.
The letter called attention to freezing temperatures and damaged infrastructure, which have stalled aid efforts amid the crisis.
“Many are struggling to find safe shelter, water, food, and medication,” the letter reads. “Several rescue organizations and nonprofits have deployed volunteers to the area and are working tirelessly around the clock, but they need all the support they can get.”
The open letter asked the administration to highlight emergency relief nonprofits including the Turkish Philanthropy Funds, the Turkey Mozaik Foundation, the Ahbap Association, and Syria Relief.
Harvard professor of Turkish Studies Cemal Kafadar, who helped to edit the letter, said he hopes for a personal statement from Bacow as well as institutional support from Harvard.
“What they expect is that the University will help through alumni associations, through its media, positions, or connections — help us disseminate the message and somehow indicate that there is an institutional support behind it,” Kafadar said.
Kafadar also noted that Columbia University President Lee C. Bollinger offered condolences in a statement last week, while Bacow has remained silent following the earthquakes.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that the University received the letter, but he declined to comment on the signatories’ requests.
Miray Topay ’06 wrote in an email that she helped to draft the open letter with the goal of garnering support for a crisis she described as “one of the worst disasters in the world in the last 100 years.”
“I can attest to the fact that the Harvard alumni group is an incredible one — caring, connected and has an ability to drive great, positive change in the world,” Topay wrote. “We are simply hoping that an outreach to this amazing group is possible through HAA.”
Ramin A. Isayev, a 2001 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School and a member of the Harvard Club of Turkey, said he signed the letter with the hope of a favorable response from Bacow.
“This is quite a big human tragedy and we shouldn’t stay aside. President Bacow, he has repeatedly demonstrated that he’s a man of the best values, a compassionate person,” Isayev said.
Ilay R. Ors, who holds a Ph.D. from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said she signed the letter after receiving it from Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies. Ors specifically pointed to the cultural impact of the earthquakes, emphasizing that the affected region was home to “many different faiths” and “religious, ethnic, cultural groups in the area.”
“Definitely the worst earthquake in maybe 100 years that devastated an entire region, a region of immense historical significance and cultural heritage,” Ors said. “So all these have been lost, in addition to something in the tens of thousands of lives, which is the most unfortunate immediate consequence of the earthquake.”
Ors added that the letter will bring awareness to fundraising organizations that are working to help those affected by the earthquakes.
“This letter is really representing a group that supports — that donations would find a healthy direction and a good outcome and an effective outcome so that they can really reach the people that need,” Ors said.
Topay said in addition to donating, Harvard students should reach out to peers from Turkey and Syria to offer support.
“Currently, I can assure you, your Turkish and Syrian friends are not OK. They have all been impacted negatively by this event — some may have lost people they know, or their family knows,” Topay wrote. “If you see them in the dining hall or one of your classes – please check in with them, ask them how they are.”
“Show that you care – maybe make a donation or post a donation link on social media. It will go a long way to show them that you care,” she added.

The Harvard Undergraduate Association’s presidential election timeline has been delayed for the second time in three days, according to emails to candidates from the body’s election commission.
In a Feb. 13 email to candidates obtained by The Crimson, the HUA election commission cited “complications” in the “candidate verification process” which led the Dean of Students Office to delay the election timeline by 24 hours.
“I am fighting for us to be clear by tomorrow morning and the campaign blurbs will be sent out to the student body once I get the verified candidates,” election commission member Victoria T. Li ’25 wrote in the email.
The campaign period for candidates, which was scheduled to begin Monday at 4 p.m., will now kick off at 12 a.m. on Wednesday. Voting, which was slated to run from Feb. 16 through Feb 18., will now run from Feb. 17 through Feb. 19.
The announcement comes two days after a Feb. 11 email from the election commission pushed back the election timeline by a day, also citing verification issues.
“I do not anticipate it delaying any further but I will make sure to notify you all first thing if I find out we have to wait again,” Li wrote in the Feb. 13 email.
Li wrote in a statement on behalf of the election commission that the timeline was delayed because the DSO must verify the eligibility of candidates before campaigning can begin.
“We have provided student information to the necessary officials and have been instructed to wait until they are finished with the verification process,” Li wrote. “While the delay is unfortunate, we just want extra precaution to ensure that all candidates are eligible to run rather than forcing any ineligible candidate(s) to withdraw after publicly announcing their candidacy.”
Ethan C. Kelly ’25, who is running for the co-presidency alongside Laila A. Nasher ’25, wrote in a statement that the delay “has us really confused.”
“We wish there would be more transparency from the DSO about why the delay is occurring,” he wrote.
DSO spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The DSO provides guidance to the HUA and furnishes the body with a budget to allocate toward club funding and other activities each year. Still, the groups operate largely independently, according to Associate Dean for Student Engagement Jason R. Meier, who said in an interview last semester that the DSO does not make decisions on behalf of the HUA.
The five tickets for the HUA co-presidency participated in a presidential debate Sunday evening, where candidates promised to increase funding for clubs and improve the HUA’s transparency.
The election will be the second-ever for the Harvard Undergraduate Association, which formed after students voted in March 2022 to dissolve the Undergraduate Council, Harvard’s previous student government structure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a historic season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team will turn towards a new class of senior leaders to continue its legacy of improvement and ferocious competition.
With the loss of key players Charlie Olmert, Kyle Massimilian, Steven Cuccurullo, Kyle Mullin, Austin Madronic, and Jake Hartje, the team will look towards a new set of seniors to lead the squad both on and off the field.
At the heart of this new group is senior captain and midfielder Nick Loring, who has been a crucial part of the squad since his first year. He is the sole captain of the team this year, a job he does not take lightly.
“Last year we had an amazing group of seniors and I think that we are filling it back with another amazing group,” Loring commented. “I’ve got a bunch of great guys by my side that has been incredibly supportive. Our locker room is chock full of great players and even better people – I’m just happy to be a part of it.”
The team has been playing together for three weeks after the almost two-month-long hiatus for winter break, and the work at practice culminated in an intrasquad scrimmage on Friday. The scrimmage was private, limited to only a select group of spectators. Having witnessed the action, as well as how the ten new first-year players slotted into the squad, there were areas in which the team has improved since last year and areas where it needs to tighten its play after such a short session together this year.
One area in which the Crimson are looking for new leadership is on the faceoff. After graduating its two senior starters Massimilian and Cuccurullo, Head Coach Gerry Byrne will look to sophomore Andrew DeGenaro, first-year Matt Barraco, and junior walk-on Mike Binkowski to win possessions at the X. Barraco is optimistic about the team’s performance at the face-off-x this season despite recently returning from an injury that sidelined him for much of the fall.
“Our faceoff group has been really welcoming to me, and it’s made it easy for me to come in and feel like I belong, which has helped me get up to game speed and the Division-I level, whether that be game speed or lacrosse IQ,” Barraco commented.
A common thread between players Loring, Barraco, and sophomore attacker Joey Graham after the scrimmage is that the season is still early and that there are still kinks to be worked out. Graham specifically noted the squad’s need to focus on “the simple things” to eliminate turnovers and mistakes. One way to attempt to not only eliminate mistakes but to capitalize on them is with the ten-man-ride which the squad has been using both in practice and in the scrimmage.
“We have plenty to work on between now and then, we’ve only been playing for about three weeks since break so there are lots of little things like situational riding and clearing, and late game situations, which the coaches have really drilled into us,” Loring said. “We’ve got the time to drill it out before UVA and I know we’re going to get there.”
While the spring season has only been underway for about three weeks, the team has been playing together since the fall, working with a limited schedule to maximize growth during fall ball. First-year midfielder Francisco Cortes, when interviewed in the fall, spoke about the team’s intense off-season in which the players worked to remain in peak physical condition, especially citing the squad’s small-group workouts over the summer as key to making sure the guys arrived on campus in shape.
Coach Byrne places an emphasis on coupling academics and athletics by providing opportunities for his team to not only compete on the highest level but to grow off the field as well. This was evident on the team’s trip to Washington, D.C. last fall which saw the lacrosse team compete against Johns Hopkins, while also prioritizing the various cultural experiences D.C. has to offer.
“The trip to D.C. was awesome. I think we did a great job of performing on the lacrosse field while also realizing there was more to the trip than just lacrosse. I was impressed by our team’s, and specifically, the younger guys’, engagement with our alumni during the Alumni Networking Event,”  senior attackman Hayden Cheek said.
Cheek is one of several returning players who will look to once again make his mark on the dynamic roster. On the defensive end of the field, the team will look to replace Mullin, who started every game in goal last year. Junior Christian Barnard is hoping to compete to fill this spot alongside his fellow goaltenders sophomore George Alvarez, senior Jack Schlendorf, and first-year Adam Blind.
“With Mullin leaving there is going to be a really intense goalie competition throughout this fall and this is my first chance to really make my mark on this program and to step up and become the starter. The competition is going to be tough but I want to step up … and be a leader on this team,” Barnard remarked.
Junior attacker Graham Blake, Cheek, and sophomore attacker Sam King are just three returning players who will look to compete for a starting role in the offensive trio. In the midfield, junior LSM Greg Campisi, senior SSDM Chase Yager, and sophomore LSM Vince Cresci will look to make an impact on the wings, and down low on the defense sophomore defender Collin Bergstrom, senior defender Chase Strupp, and sophomore defender Tommy Martinson are all set to return and will be vying for starting positions.
The first-year recruiting class that Byrne assembled brings some powerhouse talent from across the country. Players like midfielders Finn Pokorny and Logan Ip, and defenders Sean Jordan and Charlie Muller all bring fresh skill to the roster.
“The season looks bright as we welcome a Top 5 recruiting class with big-time players at every position who should compete for playing time this spring as we aim to return to the NCAA Tournament and battle for an Ivy League Title,” Byrne stated.

The day is finally upon us: Valentine’s Day! There are so many ways to spend this day, whether it be with friends (check out our guide to Galentine’s), on your own (check out our guide to being single on Valentine’s), or with your boo. But for those of you in long distance relationships, worry not — you can still enjoy this day. Whether the distance is Quad-Mather or across a continent, here are some ideas for you to celebrate with your Valentine even if you aren’t physically together.
Start the day off with texts!
Most of the time, your morning alarm is the most dreaded sound in existence, reminding you to get up and go to class. Instead, brighten up the day by starting it off with a cute good morning text! It can be short and simple, or you can write a whole poem if you want to — do as your heart says, but we’re sure your partner will appreciate the heartfelt message first thing in the morning, giving them a smile to start the day.
Send them gifts
In this day and age of technology, you can pretty much send anything anywhere (which can be both a good thing and a bad thing, but we’ll focus on the good for now). Go classic with flowers and chocolates, or you can also send gifts that represent an inside joke to make it more meaningful and special. You can either use online ordering services (Bezos it up, I guess) or ask their roommates to be the special ~secret~ messenger on your behalf. Hey, I can’t speak for everyone here, but flowers are always a quick and easy way to bring a smile to any face.
You asked them to be your Valentine…right?
Yes, you still have to ask them to be your Valentine. Yes, even if you’re dating. No, it’s not implied. Yes, go call them right now and ask. You’re welcome.
Call them!!
While it can suck to not physically be next to each other, at least you can still stay connected through phone calls and video chats, talking into the wee hours of the night while you procrastinate on your work. The best thing about long distance is that the two of you are always talking, because honestly, that’s the only thing you can really do anyways. Start and end the day with a call so they can hear your voice. :)
Write each other letters
Be a little old-fashioned: pull out a pen and paper instead of your phone. Snail mail may be a little outdated, but there’s something about putting physical words on paper that just speaks differently. You can tell them you’re thinking about them, write things you may normally hesitate to say out loud (because you have a roommate in the room), and include little gifts such as photos or cute trinkets.
Do a virtual date night
Bring the date through the screen! Plan something the two of you can do together. It can be fancy or simple, anything as long as it’s a way to spend quality time together. You can watch a movie together, order food for each other for a virtual dinner date, or play a game together. Check out one of our past articles for Virtual Valentine’s Day date ideas!
Send them a video/voice memo
Phone calls and video calls are great, but consider also sending your partner something they can save and rewatch later! Instead of a good morning text, send them a good morning voice memo. Hearing your voice is another surefire way to have them start and end their day with a smile.
Plan your next visit 
When doing long distance, it’s a huge plus to think ahead and plan when you’ll see each other next. You can plan a belated Valentine’s Day celebration and recreate the day together. But in general, get excited about seeing each other again! Hey, after all, Feb. 14 is just like any random day; you and your partner can celebrate your feelings for each other any day.
We know you miss them, but distance is temporary, and some may even say it makes the heart grow fonder. No matter how you choose to spend the day, keep your boo in mind and think about the next time you’ll see them, which will be very very soon.

PANIC MODE: Valentine’s Day is here and you have no idea what to do/where to take your boo. It’s on a Tuesday, and you have a pset due that night. Don’t worry, Harvard Square can be charming, and your hopeless-romantic, YA-romance-novel-obsessed, relationship veteran, Flyby staff writer is here. I’ve even broken it down by relationship status:
For your crush:
Okay, if you’re using Valentine’s Day as the first time to talk to your crush, keep it simple. Let’s have a daytime coffee date. We’re feeling the vibes and keeping it cute.
Your recs are:
- Bluestone Lane (potential for a snack/meal here too)
- Blue Bottle (vibes, vibes)
- Faro Café (new, trendy)
For your situationship:
You’ve been seeing — for a lack of better words — this person for a while and feelings are definitely there. My first piece of advice: DO NOT DO NOTHING. Even if you’re unofficial, talking, entangled, or whatever other placeholder Gen Z comes up with because we’re scared of commitment: you care about each other. So here are some ideas:
- A text: A Valentine’s Day text does so much more than you think. Start the day off right. Let them know you’re thinking about them.
IMPORTANT WARNING: DO NOT ONLY DO THIS
This must be accompanied by one of the following:
- Flowers: You literally can’t go wrong. Everyone loves them. There are two floral shops in the square: Brattle Square Florist and Petali. C’mon, they even sell them at CVS.
- Ordering takeout: If you’re not ready to take them out, just Doordash something and watch a movie. Light an illegal, unsanctioned-by-me-or-Harvard candle. It’s cute and intimate.
Now, if you’re ready to sit down to eat with them. Here are some cute places that won't run your pockets up.
- Felipe’s (a little step up from 1 a.m. Jefe’s)
- Nine Tastes (such good food)
- Saloniki (cute, quick, and a nice place to selfie)
For your BAE
This is your person, your boo, your partner, boyfriend/girlfriend, future spouse or spouse. Yes. You might be feeling some anxieties around Valentine’s Day because there's a lotta pressure. Just breathe and book the reservation.
If you want to wine and dine your bae, here’s some semi-fancy places in the Square:
- Toscano (beautiful, dimly lit, potential “Lady and the Tramp” moment)
- Alden and Harlow (good food, nice atmosphere)
- Barcelona Wine Bar (closer to Porter so an excellent option for you Quadlings — think about all of the tapas you could share)
(Hopefully, I don’t have to tell you to do the first two from the previous section, but this is an extensive guide: buy your partner flowers and tell them Happy Valentine’s Day.)
That’s all I got, folks.
Just keep in mind: it’s the thought that counts, and there’s always 50 percent off EVERYTHING the next day in case you need to right your wrongs. ;)

After a week of anticipation and emails, the algorithm has spoken and your Datamatch results are out. But what’s next, you may be wondering? What’s this about free food, you say? (If there’s any way to catch a Harvard student’s attention, it’s always free food.) Whether it be your first time doing Datamatch or you just want to read about other people’s experiences, we’ve compiled a list of past Datamatch matches from our writers to help you figure out what to do with your top matches!
Writer 1: I put my preferences to love and friendship, but ending up getting no love matches. The universe was really speaking to me at that moment. I went on a date with my top friendship match, not expecting much, but we’re now great friends and I love her. You might not meet the love of your life through Datamatch, but you can definitely meet someone you can drink *spicy juice* with on a Saturday night.
Writer 2: My top match last year was a friendship match with someone I had met earlier on in the year through another mutual friend. As college students, we obviously decided to capitalize on this opportunity and we got to mathing: which free food deal was the most bang-for-buck? Ultimately, we decided to go to Playa Bowl, because who doesn’t love a delicious acai bowl that kind of tastes like ice cream? The serving ended up being way smaller than we had imagined, but it was still very cute. We talked while we ate and got to know each other a little better. Alas, not much came out of the friendship match, but free food is still always a win. #staywinning
Writer 3: I matched with my roommate during Meet26. We’re in a suite of five and don’t talk much in general, so we both refused to mention it for three weeks before we finally acknowledged it. We grabbed Sunday Sundaes together after, though!
Writer 4: My top match was someone I vaguely knew from freshman year but hadn’t really seen since. Didn’t get free food since we didn’t go on a date but my friends and I still regularly reference it for fun. There’s nothing like a good stalking session with all of your friends while figuring out what you know about each other’s matches.
Writer 5: My friend got matched with someone she knew pretty well. Neither of them had any interest in going on the date, so she easily convinced him to let us use the free food voucher instead. It was a cute Galentine's moment, and our girls date is one of my favorite memories I’ve made. Ovaries before brovaries!
Writer 6: I got nine friend matches and one love match, who had no picture, bio, or prompt responses, AND they lived in the Quad.
And there you have it: real, lived experiences from your favorite student life writers. We hope that we provided some insight into what to expect for your Datamatch results, but at the same time, just have fun with it! It’s all fun and games, unless… ;)
