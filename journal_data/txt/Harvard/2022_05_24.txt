After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Julia (Julie Ledru), the protagonist of Lola Quivoron’s electrifying new film “Rodeo” — which premiered on May 19 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival — sets out to become a dirt bike stunt-racer, it seems that every possible obstacle is in her way. For one, she needs a bike. High-performing dirt bikes are expensive, hard to find, and even harder to hang onto in the run-down apartment complex in suburban France where she lives in a strained limbo with her family. But these circumstances won’t stop her; she develops a simple scam to swindle eBay sellers out of their bikes by taking them for a test ride, capitalizing on the (usually male) buyers’ tendency to brush her off as harmless.
From the early moment when she scrapes a handful of gravel into an empty purse, wipes her palms, then hands the bag to an unwitting seller as collateral while she takes off with his bike, her thorny fearlessness sets the tone of the film, bringing the audience into her obsession with achieving glory on the asphalt. Before long, Quiveron’s mesmerizing direction and heart-stopping script ensure the audience shares in this obsession, offering a glimpse into a hyper-competitive sport and its accompanying underground that few viewers may have encountered before.
Once Julia has a bike, she needs a gang. As Kaïs (Yanis Lafki) is quick to warn her when she approaches him to beg for spare gas at her first motocross meet, showing up alone leaves her totally vulnerable. The world of competitive biking is cutthroat and dangerous even for its top players, and a lone newcomer is more likely to have their bike lifted than receive a warm welcome. Nevermind that Julia is a woman, and everyone around her sees biking as a man’s game; the prospect of a female competitor strikes her male peers as laughable and then enraging, stoking resentment, harassment, and eventually threats of violence against her.
Quivoron’s pastiche of this first meet is dizzying. As a whirlwind of reckless bikers loop the track, one-upping one another, the spectacle is addictive yet edged with danger, both from the bikes and their riders. Quivoron’s vision of the racing scene is at once brutally fast and delicately lyrical: Through her lens, bikers move across the asphalt like armor-clad dancers, daring one another closer and closer to injury. Bolstered by cinematographer Raphaël Vandenbussche’s gritty, luminous visuals, Quivoron gazes on the bikers’ world with an outsider’s awe and an insider’s intimacy, making it impossible to look away as Julia wheedles her way into a crew.
She manages to get in with Kaïs’ group, the Be-More’s, who operate a shadowy underground garage at the strict direction of its incarcerated owner Domino (Sébastien Schroeder), who obsessively checks in on their activities via video chat. In the gang, Julia finds uneasy acceptance with most of her peers and endures simmering rage from a few, making it clear that her membership rests on shaky ground. She gains a modicum of security, though, when Domino realizes he may be able to capitalize on her exclusion from the male-dominated norms of biking and enlists her to steal bikes through her innocuous test-driving scam. As Julia struggles to reconcile her fierce independence with the intensifying control of the biker crew, Ledru deftly portrays the competing forces of determination, self-preservation, and desperation that drive her actions, delivering a mesmerizing and varied performance.
This film marks Ledru’s feature debut, and she conveys her character’s unshakable resolve and resourcefulness so movingly that it keeps the film from dragging in the slower second act. There, the story turns away from sport biking and Julia’s stunt ambitions to focus on her growing involvement in Domino’s world, from stealing bikes on his behalf to buying groceries for his family.
Once she’s fallen in with the crew, Julia has a shot at racing alongside real bikers in the motocross scene. But although she obsesses over stunt videos, she lacks basic skills. The film initially frames her training as her third obstacle, setting up an obvious but satisfying underdog-to-champion arc (like “Million Dollar Baby” on a tarmac track!). Instead, though, “Rodeo” leaves convention behind. In fact it leaves the matter of skills and stunts in the dust altogether, showing how Julia quickly moves on from dreaming of wheelies to planning elaborate bike heists. Quivoron movingly depicts how Julia’s passion for the sport becomes just another scheme for survival, and her life reorients around her new purpose of maintaining Domino’s favor and supporting his beleaguered wife Ophélie (Antonia Buresi). The film’s emotional undercurrent rises to the fore, transforming it from a sincere sports-hero story to a character-focused crime drama imbued with grim realism.
In the hands of a less skilled director, this pivot could drain the film of its momentum or adrenaline. Instead, as Quivoron details Julia’s involvement in her gang’s social scene and criminal efforts, the pace slows enough to cast the main characters in sharper focus and draw their relationships with renewed depth, lending the film new heart and higher stakes. Julia’s friendship with Ophélie is a highlight of the story, placing the pair’s respective independence and captivity in contrast to underscore how men ultimately exert control over them and the world they live in. The film is both a window into the pervasive misogyny endemic to the underground biking scene and a broader commentary on the way men are threatened by female independence, often reacting not just abstractly but with physical intimidation, harassment, and control.
In the midst of all these tribulations, Quivoron never trivializes Julia’s love for biking. Instead, she shows how it brings her a deep and singular joy, portraying the all-consuming thrill of her rides. Throughout the film, road-biking sequences lift off the screen with their lush vitality, bridging the gap between the sharp-edged world of motocross and the bleak reality of Julia’s home life. Julia’s relationship with biking is one of liberation, as Quivoron illustrates. As she navigates between hostile environments and struggles against forces of loneliness, poverty, and cruelty, biking offers a meditative reprieve. But as Quivoron’s stinging, feminist film asks: Can this sanctuary survive the crushing pressures of Julia’s life?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The title of the Japanese dystopian drama “Plan 75,” which premiered on May 20 at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, may sound innocuous enough. But the simple title actually refers to a sinister solution to the country’s aging population issue. Because the elderly generation vastly outnumbers the younger generation, a free government program in Hayawaka’s dystopian Japan encourages citizens 75 and older to die voluntarily through assisted suicide. The narrative follows the stories of three people following the rollout of this program: a solitary elderly woman named Michi (Chieko Baisho), a young man named Hinomu (Hayato Isomura) who works as a salesman for Plan 75, and a young Filipino woman named Maria (Stefanie Arianna Akashi) with an ill daughter who also begins working for Plan 75 to make money. With its unsettling premise, “Plan 75” paints a somber picture of old age, with a few pinpoints of hope interspersed throughout a slowly paced but artfully shot film.
Michi is first shown working in housekeeping at a hotel; because she has no living family, she is forced to keep working to sustain herself despite her old age. After she loses her job at the hotel, she is continually turned down by other companies because of her age. When she turns to welfare for assistance, she encounters bureaucratic roadblocks. Her story is an extremely bleak but unfortunately realistic portrayal of the lack of social support offered to elderly people in many societies. And yet, although it’s deeply saddening to watch this play out, Baisho is endearingly sympathetic as a lonely and good-natured woman who eventually feels cornered into choosing Plan 75 as the only way out of her predicament.
Some of the most evocative scenes of the film are between Mishi and the assigned Plan 75 agent who guides her through the process and comes to bond with Mishi after the older woman asks if they can spend time together outside of the context of work (which is not allowed by Plan 75). They go bowling together at a place where Mishi used to frequent with her late husband. The agent, a young woman who takes a genuine liking to Michi, helps her bowl. When Michi lands a strike, it’s an unexpectedly poignant moment of joy in an otherwise darkly tinged narrative.
The incisive script excels at highlighting the callousness of the government while still showing how the individuals selling Plan 75 are conflicted about the work that they do. The program is designed to entice elderly people with promises of a $1,000 grant to spend on whatever they’d like before they die, or a “group” option to be buried with loved ones. They can even pay extra to go to an all inclusive luxury resort as a last hurrah before death. The salespeople are meant to pitch all of this with fervor, but as the film progresses it effectively shows the psychic toll the sinister program takes on the young employees. Himono, for example, vigorously pitches the program to clients until his own estranged uncle signs up. He’s suddenly facing a moral dilemma as he gets to know his uncle better and also learns more about the dubious behind-the-scenes reality of the program. Meanwhile, Maria is in charge of taking care of the belongings of those who have chosen to die through Plan 75, sorting through countless items in a room filled with vestiges of life from shoes to watches. Watching her do her job, viewers witness an unnerving material reflection of the loss of human life.
The film’s creative cinematography is noteworthy with its subtly powerful framings of characters. Shots are captured with careful restraint and are able to render the characters’ moments of banality into aesthetically interesting scenes. Close ups are relatively rare and characters are often focused on from a distance, sometimes giving viewers the sense that they’re intruding on private moments. For example, as Hinomu spends more time with his uncle, one distant shot shows them standing side by side doing dishes together. With their backs facing the camera, the difference in age between the two men becomes less clear and they become strikingly similar.
Through thoughtfully centered stories, “Plan 75” is ultimately an indictment of ageism. Although it’s a grim portrait of how older generations are often cast aside, Hayakawa’s film is at its core a celebration of life — life in all of its mundanity, loneliness, grief, and, of course, its beauty. Mishi spends much of her time alone throughout the film, taking care of her plants or cleaning her apartment. While she’s still searching for interpersonal connections, her solitude does not make her life any less meaningful. “Plan 75” upholds the inherent value of human life with its introspective writing and performances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow traveled to Washington, D.C., last week to lobby against taxes on large university endowments and tightened federal regulations for foreign funding disclosures.
Bacow met with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Senator Mike K. Braun (R-Ind.), Secretary of Labor Martin J. Walsh, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer ’71 (D-N.Y.), and Domestic Policy Council Director Susan E. Rice. He also met with members of the Massachusetts delegation.
“Depending upon who I’m speaking to, the agenda changes slightly, but pretty much it’s the same,” Bacow said in an interview last Wednesday. “It’s about federal support for universities, broadly defined.”
Harvard spent $560,000 on federal lobbying during President Joe Biden’s first year in office. During his visit last week, Bacow said he advocated for greater federal research funding and immigration reform to support international students and scholars. He also urged lawmakers to double the maximum Federal Pell Grant award. More than one-third of American undergraduates rely on the Pell Grant program.
Bacow also continued to lobby against the 1.4 percent excise tax on the returns of university endowments that amount to more than $500,000 per student. The law — enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a landmark piece of legislation under the Trump administration — costs Harvard tens of millions of dollars per year.
Former University President Drew G. Faust took sharp aim at the tax when it was signed into law, calling it “a blow at the strength of higher American education” in a 2018 interview.
Last week, Bacow called the endowment tax “bad public policy,” noting more schools fall under its scope than in years past.
“Taxing charitable resources away from higher education institutions does not make them more affordable — it has exactly the opposite effect,” he said. “With the growth in endowment returns, there are now a far larger number of colleges and universities that are subject to this tax than were previously, so it just keeps capturing more and more institutions.”
Harvard will pay more in federal taxes than Ford Motor Company and General Motors, Bacow said during an event at The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., last Wednesday.
At the same event, Bacow noted that “all but a handful of schools” subject to the tax are in Democratic states.
Bacow also criticized proposals for stricter foreign research funding disclosure requirements, saying the rules would be a roadblock to recruiting foreign scholars and a burden on the federal government’s processing power. Bills currently in Congress, such as the Bipartisan Innovation Act, would lower the reporting threshold for foreign funds.
While on Capitol Hill, Bacow balanced lobbying with other presidential duties: Between conversations with lawmakers, he participated in a Zoom event addressing the University’s recent release of its Legacy of Slavery report alongside Radcliffe Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin last Tuesday.

The Harvard Business School received a $5 million donation to create programming and provide financial support for students interested in sports management careers.
The gift — donated by alumnus Josh Harris and his wife, Marjorie — will create a Harris Family Fund for Sports Management and Alternative Investments at HBS and aim to “promote the diversity, equity, and inclusion of underrepresented individuals in these fields, while simultaneously advancing research,” per a press release. The fund will expand upon a previous donation from Harris in 2015, which established the Josh Harris Endowment for Sports Management.
“This generous gift from Josh and Marjorie will remove barriers for our students and spur research among our faculty, creating exciting new opportunities,” HBS Dean Srikant Datar said in a press release.
In an effort to eliminate financial barriers to entry into sports management careers, the fund will help launch fellowship programs that provide salary supplements to recent graduates. It will also offer scholarships to Executive Education or HBS Online students who are interested in sport-related fields and support faculty research, curriculum development, and case writing within HBS.
“We know that diversity, equity, and inclusion are essential to the long-term viability of every organization,” Datar said. “This is not just a social or moral imperative, but increasingly an economic imperative, too.”
Harris, who graduated from HBS in 1990, is the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, and Harris Philanthropies. He is also a managing partner of the Philadelphia 76ers and general partner of the Crystal Palace Football Club. Both Harris and his wife serve on the HBS Board of Dean Advisors.
“Attending Harvard Business School had an immeasurable impact on my career, and I am thrilled to give back to an institution that provided me so many incredible opportunities,” Harris said in a press release. “This fund will go towards supporting students from diverse backgrounds who are interested in pursuing careers in either Alternative Investments or Sports Management — two industries that are close to my heart but that urgently need to include more voices from more communities.”

A TD Bank branch in Harvard Square was robbed Monday afternoon for the third time in the last month.
Cambridge Police arrested Jacob Pimentel, 31, of Boston, who allegedly passed a note to the teller demanding money at about 4:43 p.m. Monday, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick. Officers apprehended Pimentel, who was unarmed, in front of Harvard’s Smith Campus Center.
Pimentel was arrested by several officers who had weapons drawn while attempting to flee the scene in a taxi. The suspect held his hands out the window of the car as officers surrounded the vehicle on foot, according to a video of the arrest provided by an eyewitness. An officer retrieved a stack of bills from Pimentel’s left hand, while another opened the cab door.
Pimentel is expected to be charged with unarmed robbery and arraigned later in the week, Warnick said.
Anna Y. Gong ’23, an eyewitness, said she and a friend saw the incident after walking back from Kung Fu Tea, describing it as a “stressful” experience.
“I heard some yelling, and we turned around and other people were turning around too, and we saw police with weapons drawn pointing into the window of his taxi,” Gong said. “It was very action-packed.”
Prior to Monday, that TD Bank location had been robbed twice in the last month — once on April 27 and once on May 2. According to Warnick, Pimentel is not believed to be a suspect in the other two incidents. CPD has issued a warrant for the arrest of another individual in connection with one of the prior robberies.
The robbery came amid a spike in robberies in Cambridge through the first 17 weeks of 2022. According to the city’s monthly crime report, there had been 36 robberies between January and May 2, more than double the figure at that point in 2021. In addition to the three TD Bank robberies, another Cambridge location was struck in February, Webster Bank in Brattle Square.
Ryan K. Hong ’23, who witnessed the arrest from outside the Smith Center, said he was “a bit shocked” by the incident.
“Harvard Square’s a pretty safe place,” Hong said. “Pretty interesting that this would happen right in an intersection, probably the most-walked crosswalk by Harvard students.”

Earlier this month, Massachusetts State Representative Michael J. Moran and University Executive Vice President Katherine N. “Katie” Lapp exchanged a pair of letters discussing Harvard’s communication with Allston residents about its plans for the Department of Transportation’s I-90/Allston Multimodal project.
The project, which would replace the Allston Interchange, aims to improve accessibility to public transportation, including the Commuter Rail and West Station. In her May 11 letter, Lapp describes Harvard’s desire to “create connectivity across historically separated north and south Allston neighborhoods” by installing decking over the highway and rail yard.
The project is still in the process of securing a federal environmental permit, though the city anticipates that work will begin in the fall. Moran’s letter, sent May 9, raises concerns about the University’s level of communication with residents regarding its plans for the decking development.
“As an environmental justice community with a vast expanse of highway that separates us from our neighbors and the Charles River, we seek to improve the livability and connectivity of our neighborhood dramatically,” Moran wrote. “Allston residents have always advocated for decking over infrastructure to enhance the fabric of our neighborhood and increase access to the riverfront.”
In his letter, Moran called on Harvard to include Allston residents in the planning process and posed questions regarding the “type, size, and density” of the development — details that have yet to be shared publicly.
“We seek a comprehensive urban planning process rather than Harvard’s current piecemeal approach, which is fragmented and opaque,” he wrote.
Moran also urged Harvard to utilize the Harvard Allston Task Force, an advisory group for Harvard’s developments that includes residents and University representatives.
In her letter, Lapp explained that Harvard does not yet have specific details about the extent of its decking plans, writing that the public planning process is a “prerequisite” to making any decisions about the matter.
Lapp concluded her letter by expressing Harvard’s willingness to meet with the Task Force.
“We are enthusiastic to participate in public meetings of the Harvard Allston Task Force, as you have requested,” she wrote.
Moran is not the only one to criticize Harvard’s transparency with Allston residents about its future developments in the neighborhood.
Earlier this spring, the Coalition for a Just Allston and Brighton — a group of Allston-Brighton residents, local organizations, and government officials, including Moran — sent a 19-page letter to Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 outlining a set of recommendations for Harvard’s development processes in Allston. The letter included a section on public outreach, which called on the University to make a larger effort to include residents in its decision-making for proposed projects.
Around the same time, Lapp also sent a letter to Wu outlining a set of commitments for the University’s communication with residents. Lapp referenced those pledges in her response to Moran’s May 9 letter, stating that Harvard has already “committed to an area-wide public planning process” in writing.
In response to Lapp’s May 11 letter, Moran said in an interview that he believes discussions about the project have already happened “behind closed doors,” despite the University’s insistence that no project will go forth without a public city planning process.
“That’s not private property. That’s state land,” Moran said.
“These discussions should be happening in the public, not between Harvard and an administration that’s on its way out the door. And that’s what I’m fearful of,” he added, referencing Lapp’s announcement that she would step down from her role this summer, which came one day after she sent her letter.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment on Moran’s concerns, pointing to Lapp’s May 11 letter as a response.
Looking to the future, Moran said he believes the discussion over air rights for the Allston Multimodal project will have implications for the planning process for Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus — a proposed 900,000 square-foot development that will include a hotel and conference center, housing units, open space, retail use, and lab space.
"Maybe it's time that we think about putting proper planning in place with our new city planner that accurately [reflects] the entire Beacon Yards project including the potential air right over West Station,” he wrote in a statement. “ERC is a much different project now given the additional acres of development from the air rights.”

Harvard University Police Department Chief Victor A. Clay plans to develop a proposal that would create five new unarmed Campus Support Officer positions, he said in an interview last week.
The new CSOs would be uniformed and hired from the local area. They would respond to lockouts, lost property calls, and other situations in which an armed officer is “not really the best use of personnel,” Clay said. The department aims to establish the five positions by fall 2022.
The plan comes less than a year after Clay began his tenure as Harvard's police chief. Since he took over, HUPD has seen a series of internal changes, leaving just three members of previous HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley’s senior leadership team on the department’s current command staff.
Clay cited the growing popularity of CSOs as a reason why HUPD is looking into establishing the new positions.
“All over the country, we have CSOs, so it's time to bring it here to Harvard,” Clay said. “We’re going to hire from the community, and hopefully I can get that going really quick before the fall semester.”
Clay also said that HUPD will expand officer training beyond what is currently mandated by the state and industry to include aspects such as emotional intelligence and de-escalation training.
Clay said the CSOs would not necessarily respond to mental health crises, noting that such calls would require more skill to handle. Still, he said he is considering changes to HUPD’s response to mental health crises and has met regularly with Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen to discuss potential reforms.
Clay also serves on a committee that will implement recommendations to improve students’ mental health that were developed by the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health, convened by Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in April 2019.
Several college police departments nationwide have incorporated CSOs. Last March, Tufts University announced that within the next two years, it would adopt a similar model in which unarmed Campus Security Officers not in uniform will respond to routine calls.
“The presence of these unarmed security personnel will reduce the number of interactions between armed officers and those members of our community who have experienced racial harm or trauma because of police presence or police encounters,” Yolanda Smith, executive director of Tufts University Department of Public Safety, wrote in an email Friday.
Meanwhile, the Cambridge City Council has weighed non-police public safety alternatives, such as the Holistic Emergency Alternative Response Team, which would address mental health crises. In May, the Cambridge City Council’s Finance Committee voted unanimously to advance a $3 million proposal to fund a future Department of Community Safety.
Some students are skeptical of the effort. Claire E. Pryor ’23, a police abolitionist, said CSOs would not appropriately address students’ mental health needs because of their ties to the police and called on the University to consider adopting a model similar to HEART instead.
“HEART is so powerful because the whole structure of the program came out of community research, out of community survey, asking people who are most impacted, ‘What do you need?’” Pryor said.
“It’s really clear to me that any kind of alternative crisis response system, especially a mental health crisis response system, number one, needs to start with talking to people who are most impacted and, number two, can't involve the police at all — and this proposal from Chief Clay is not doing either of those things,” Pryor added.
HUPD Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to a request for comment.
Sarah Shaughnessy, chief of staff to Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, said in an interview the CSO positions will potentially be discussed during the HUPD Advisory Board’s meeting in June. The board was established after an external review concluded that the department should consider procedural changes and engage in a community-driven process of defining public safety and reimagining HUPD.
Former Harvard Undergraduate Council President Noah A. Harris ’22, who serves on the Advisory Board, said the board had previously discussed the possibility of having unarmed officers who could build more trust with students.
“I thought that would be a really good opportunity to start to build more relationships with the community,” Harris said.
Harvard Undergraduate Association Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 said the addition of CSOs would make students more likely to call HUPD during lockouts. He added that Clay should consider expanding the number of CSO positions after the five proposed ones are implemented.
“The presence of armed officers causes a lot of fear and anxiety for so many students,” Johnson said. “I do think unarmed police officers are the right way to go.”
Pryor, however, stated she is opposed to the future CSO proposal.
“If that actually means creating five new positions and getting the money for five new salaries, I feel deeply opposed to that because I know from history that more money going to police departments never actually reduces police power,” Pryor said.

Harvard Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program filed a lawsuit against the federal government on April 27, alleging an incoming Harvard Medical School fellow was unlawfully denied entrance to the United States.
In addition to the lawsuit — which named U.S. Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas among the defendants — the Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program filed a complaint to the Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.
Iranian-born Maryam Shamloo, a Canadian citizen, first attempted to enter the United States on April 2, 2021 to begin her fellowship at Harvard Medical School on May 1. A diabetes researcher, Shamloo applied to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in July 2020 and was accepted for the two-year post from a pool of 200 candidates.
Per a press release, her attempt to enter the U.S. in 2021 was marked by “discriminatory and demeaning treatment” by Customs and Border Control, which the lawsuit alleges denied entry to Shamloo and her husband “because they were both born in Iran.”
“Ultimately, the family was denied entry due to baseless accusations that they intended to permanently reside in the US when in fact their entire lives, including their house, assets, and jobs, are in Canada,” the press release reads.
On April 18, 2021, Shamloo tried to enter the U.S. for a second time without her husband and children, where she was yet again denied entry.
Canadian citizens are typically not required to obtain visas to visit or study in the U.S., but Shamloo was told by customs officials to “apply for a visa as all Iranians must do,” per the complaint. Agents also allegedly questioned Shamloo about her Iranian background, asking if she was trained as a spy and demanding she read a document in Arabic — a language she does not speak.
Despite applying for a visa after being denied entry, Shamloo has yet to receive one, though the time the U.S. deems an acceptable waiting period, 180 days, has long passed. Her visa is in an “indefinite state of administrative processing at the US Consulate in Calgary, Canada,” the lawsuit says.
The Law School clinic called on the federal government to provide Shamloo with a visa as soon as possible.
The Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Homeland Security Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties did not immediately respond for comment.

Harvard will host its first in-person Commencement Exercises since 2019 on Thursday. With three classes set to graduate this week, Harvard Square is alive and bustling with students, families, friends, and tourists.
But since the last Commencement, the Square has undergone a series of changes.
When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, Harvard Square was devastated by the sudden loss of customers as students returned home and travel came to a halt.
“What we always knew — but the pandemic drove the message home — was how much Harvard Square relies on tourism,” said Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.
Daniel P. Roughan, the owner of recent Harvard Square addition, Source Restaurant, described the Square as a “transient epicenter of movement,” explaining that the area is constantly changing.
Here’s a look at how the Square has transformed.
During the initial lockdowns, roughly 480 Cambridge businesses shuttered their doors — some temporarily and some for good — according to small business advocacy group Cambridge Local First. Staple Harvard Square businesses were forced to close permanently, including Thai restaurant Spicies, Tex-Mex favorite Border Cafe, and nearly 50-year-old coffee shop Cafe Pamplona.
The location of beloved Harvard Square staple Cafe Pamplona now serves as the clubhouse to the all-female Bee Club after the building was purchased by the club’s then-president.
Other businesses that have bid farewell to the Square in the past two years include robotic kitchen Spyce, &pizza, Chinese restaurant Tom’s BaoBao, bakery café Au Bon Pain, Italian restaurant Benedetto, Boston Tea Stop, and seafood restaurant Legal Sea Foods.
Blue Bottle Coffee closed temporarily but has since reopened, and 105-year-old Brattle Square Florist was set to close permanently before its longtime manager — a member of the store's founding family — purchased it.
To students’ great dismay, the Mass Ave. Starbucks also closed down last year. Its location will now house a Harvard Shop run by the Harvard Student Agencies.
Though the Square has said goodbye to a number of beloved businesses since the last Commencement, many shops and restaurants have also opened their doors for the first time.
Source Restaurant, a farm-to-table pizzeria, opened on Church Street in November 2020. Lovepop, a specialty card store, opened in July 2021 at 18 John F. Kennedy Street. Ben and Jerry’s reopened in a new location in January after a two-year-long hiatus, and Wusong Road, a Chinese restaurant and bar, opened in February.
Life Alive Organic Cafe opened in March in a collaborative storefront with a yoga studio on JFK Street.
The renovated Abbott Building located on Brattle Street is slated to open later this year after a long construction process that began in 2016. The new storefronts will feature a Starbucks, a comedy club, and the new location of El Jefe’s Taqueria.
Other new restaurants include boba tea chains Gong Cha and Kung Fu Tea, sandwich shop Sally’s Sandwiches, Dominican restaurant Las Palmas, seafood restaurants The Boiling Crab and Summer Shack, BBQ eatery The Smoke Shop, and Italian restaurant Bar Enza.
The Square also welcomed Cambridge Uncommon, an e-commerce pop-up store, and Cookies, a cannabis shop.
Regional diner chain The Friendly Toast is set to open in the former location of Grafton Street Pub, which moved to JFK Street where Park Restaurant and Bar was previously housed.
Suzanne P. Blier, president of Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, attributed changes to the Harvard Square landscape to the “turnover” of local businesses to national companies.
The HSNA is currently advocating for a 70 percent local businesses zoning ordinance — a goal Blier says will help retain the amount of small local businesses.
Longtime local businesses noted that the Square has bounced back following the pandemic.
“The place is definitely back to the energy it used to have,” said Stephen Zedros, owner of Brattle Square Florist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When members of the Harvard College Class of 2021 returns to campus this month, they will receive more than a long-awaited in-person Commencement — for the first time in Harvard’s history, they will also have the opportunity to claim a commemorative non-fungible token, or NFT.
NFTs are a form of digital asset that represent ownership over the original copy of a real-world image or other object. First minted in 2014, the tokens’ popularity has erupted in recent years, with some selling for tens of millions of dollars in auction.
The commemorative NFTs the Class of 2021 will receive were created in partnership with FTX.US, a cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States.
“To commemorate our time at Harvard College and recognize the unique moment we are at in history, we have a timeless gift for each of you,” the 2021 Class Committee announced in an email to the graduates last week.
Thirteen random recipients will also win a “rare” NFT redeemable for merchandise and other “benefits” at graduation and alumni reunions, according to the announcement.
Following their eviction from campus due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, members of the Class of 2021 spent the rest of their college experience under pandemic restrictions and took classes virtually. After spending a semester on a low-density campus, the Class of 2021 attended a virtual Commencement.
Class Committee Secretary Devin B. Srivastava ’21 said the committee members hoped to provide each graduate a unique “digital representation of this time.”
“We want to commemorate this special moment in history, and we were thinking of a way that we could do that,” said Srivastava, a former Crimson News editor. “And I think topical in this time period is digital ways to remember the special moments.”
Yuke Zheng ’21, who spearheaded the launch of the commemorative NFTs alongside Cyrus N. Faruque ’21, said they were “inspired” by a MIT student who gave undergrads at the school $100 worth of Bitcoin in 2014. The cryptocurrency has since multiplied in value significantly.
Though Srivastava said he was unable to provide an “explicit value” for the NFTs, he said they may appreciate in value “in many years” depending on the market’s circumstances.
Zheng said he and Faruque are “optimistic” about the potential future value of the commemorative NFTs due to the buzz they have already generated — including Twitter memes created by members of the Class of 2021.
“The virality of NFTs historically is what tends to bring the most value to them,” Zheng said. “It depends on the market and the hype generated around them, but overall, we’re definitely optimistic.”
Faruque said he believes the commemorative NFTs could become a “popular or valuable collector’s item” in the future.
According to Srivastava, anyone who graduated in the academic or social Class of 2021 — including those who took a leave of absence — will be eligible to redeem an NFT.
“This is really the first of its kind, and we’re really happy that the Class of 2021 is going to be able to be the class that has it,” Srivastava said.
