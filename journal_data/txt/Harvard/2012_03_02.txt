After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you have been reading the Crimson editorial page at all recently, you are most likely aware that the Harvard Kennedy School will be hosting a conference this weekend devoted to discussing the possibility of a “one-state solution” to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In response to this event, numerous Jewish organizations and public figures have harshly condemned Harvard’s financial support for the conference. Some have dubbed it an “academic pogrom” while a prominent petition currently being circulated goes so far as to deem the gathering a “manifestation of the face of the ‘new anti-Semitism.’”
These incendiary charges go too far. While we too possess strong reservations about the content of the conference, we defend the right of students to hold this symposium, and Harvard’s right to sponsor it.
To call this conference, as the petition does, a forum for “one of the most ancient forms of racial hatred,” is unwarranted and counterproductive. Allegations like these simply serve to stymie serious public discourse on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There is no evidence that the discussion at this conference expresses antipathy towards Jews as a people, which is the definition of anti-Semitism. There is definitely a line to be drawn regarding such sentiments, and we do not believe that this conference crosses it.
It is also important to note that Harvard has hosted and helped fund numerous controversial conferences in the past, reflecting its robust commitment to academic freedom. Last April, 2011, for example, a student group at the Harvard Extension School ran the Social Transformation Conference, which promoted faith-based initiatives in the public sphere but in addition featured strongly and openly homophobic and Islamophobic speakers. This event quickly drew the ire of numerous student groups on campus, and also sparked a widely- circulated petition urging Harvard to cancel the conference. But rather than calling on Harvard to withdraw its sponsorship, we urged individuals concerned with the conference’s content to attend “and embrace free speech as much as the conference organizers.” We encourage individuals who find the One-State Conference objectionable to follow suit and make their views known.
In this spirit, we forcefully contend that there are numerous well-reasoned and powerful arguments to be made against the so-called “one-state solution” proposed by this conference. Practical questions of implementing such a solution aside, the one-state solution effectively denies the Jewish people the right to national self-determination. Indeed, only the two-state solution protects and respects the national aspirations of both Jews and Palestinians in this conflict, and is the sole solution supported by a majority of both parties—not to mention the international community. The One State Conference utterly fails to address these crucial concerns.
Furthermore, just as we condemn the radical rhetoric of some of the conference’s detractors, we also condemn the extremist language of some of its supporters. In an op-ed that ran in the Crimson on Monday, for example, three advocates for the conference compared Israel to Apartheid South Africa, and laid the entirety of blame for the perpetuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the Jewish state. Aside from its dishonesty, this kind of sophistry is deeply unproductive and fosters neither normalization nor dialogue between the two sides; indeed, it promotes mistrust and retrenchment.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has a long and protracted history, with both sides having committed wrongs over the last six decades. Any attempt to resolve this conflict must acknowledge this, and not ignore it in favor of self-serving demonization of the other. We therefore wish to highlight Harvard Students for Israel’s nuanced and level-headed response to this conference, which balances a profound disapproval of its content with support for the right of all Harvard students to political expression. It is our sincere hope that HSI’s statement can serve as a model for a more civil campus discourse on Israel/Palestine in the years ahead.

The notion that Jews are an endangered minority can be hard to fathom on a campus like Harvard’s. After all, who here doesn’t have a Jewish friend or professor? Indeed, living in a country like the United States, with its historically unprecedented low levels of anti-Semitism, the idea that Jews might face discrimination due to their national identity or religious beliefs seems like a relic of the distant past. But outside the Harvard bubble, Jews comprise just roughly 2% of Americans and only 0.2% of the world’s population. And unfortunately, discrimination against this tiny minority not only exists but is commonplace in many parts of the world.
Consider: Jews are fleeing Malmo, Sweden, where a local rabbi has been the victim of more than fifty anti-Semitic incidents in the six years he has lived there. In France, synagogues and Jewish community centers have been repeatedly fire-bombed. Amsterdam’s police force has resorted to using decoy Jews to track down anti-Semitic attackers because in many neighborhoods wearing a skullcap is reason enough to be assaulted. Elsewhere in Europe, anti-Semitic inscriptions on building walls are once again becoming frequent sights and Jewish cemeteries have been ransacked. In the 2009 Ukrainian elections, prominent academics blamed “the Zionists” for famine and poor economic conditions. In the former Soviet Republic of Moldova, where religiously inspired mobs have destroyed menorahs in the public square, the Jewish population has dwindled from 66,000 pre-World War II to 12,000. As we write, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez is employing anti-Semitic invective for political purposes, going so far as to Photoshop a Star of David onto an opponent’s lapel in the state-run press.
Some Harvard students have experienced anti-Semitism abroad personally: one of us, Anna, spent her high school years in Belgium and can attest to the hatred that thrived there. In the most striking instance, camp counselors watched passively as four teenage boys assaulted her for daring to wear a Jewish star. Ironically, some thirty years earlier, her parents had emigrated from the Soviet Union as political refugees in part due to rising anti-Jewish sentiment under an oppressive Communist regime. Her father recalls defending his smaller Jewish classmates from beatings and being himself barred from Moscow’s best universities despite having been awarded a medal of highest academic distinction upon graduating high school.
And the depressing list goes on. Facing such pervasive intolerance, Jews from around the world seek refuge in Israel--the only country with an open Jewish immigration policy that guarantees asylum to a population that so desperately needs it. Indeed, the vast majority of Israel’s early immigrants either faced persecution or were expelled from their homelands, both in Europe--where Zionist pioneers like Theodor Herzl advocated statehood in response to harsh anti-Semitism--and throughout the Middle East. In 1947-8, for instance, Arab countries expelled 800,000 Jews in retribution for the establishment of Israel, cruelly uprooting centuries-old communities. These Jews were absorbed by the nascent Jewish state. More recently, almost a million Russian Jews fled to Israel to escape the persecutions of the Soviet Union, while tens of thousands of other endangered Jews were airlifted by Israel out of Yemen and Ethiopia. And of course, countless Israelis are descended from Holocaust survivors. It is thus with some justification that the great Israeli author and peace advocate Amoz Oz has written that “Nocturnal Israel is a refugee camp with more nightmares per square mile I guess than any other place in the world. Almost everyone has seen the devil.”
Israel, in other words, is a haven for the most persecuted population in human history. It is the civilized world’s answer to the reality of rampant anti-Semitism across the globe. At a time when some on this campus would seek to turn the world’s only Jewish state into a binational non-Jewish state, rather than support a just two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, this point cannot be stressed enough. For while there are many formidable arguments for Israel’s right to exist, few so starkly express the consequences of a world without a Jewish Israel. After all, if Israel did not exist, who would have saved the Jews of Africa, Europe and the Soviet Union? And who will provide guaranteed refuge for those now seeking to escape anti-Semitic oppression?
Of all peoples, Americans have traditionally supported Israel’s right to exist because we intuitively grasp its utter necessity. As an early ardent American Zionist once put it, Israel would be “a home for the homeless, a goal for the wanderer, an asylum for the persecuted.” That Zionist was Emma Lazarus, who also wrote the words inscribed upon our Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” What America has been to the world, Israel is to the Jews. Let us never forget that, even in the comfortable confines of our Harvard campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Long before Harvard students occupied the Yard to end income inequality, Harvard women used the tactic of occupation toward their own vision of equal opportunity.
On March 6, 1971, about 150 women occupied 888 Memorial Drive, a Graduate School of Design building that was mostly abandoned and about to be destroyed.
The occupation began at the end of a march for International Women’s Day. As the peaceful procession winded back to Harvard Square, as had been planned, the marchers split off and entered 888 Memorial Drive. They stayed there for 10 days.
The group, self-defined as “feminist, anti-imperialist, socialist,” declared that they would not leave until they were satisfied with the University’s response. Their demands: low-income housing on the site, funds for a women’s center, and use of the building until it was to be torn down. While the women occupied, they produced flyers and press statements about the need for a women’s center in the area. They worked with community activists from Riverside, who were protesting Harvard’s expansion into the neighborhood. They also began their own makeshift center—holding auto mechanics and karate classes, cooking food for each other, and providing childcare.
More impressively, by the time they left the building on a judge’s orders, the occupiers had raised several thousand dollars toward their goal. A few months later, they were able to buy what would become the Cambridge Women’s Center. The Cambridge Women’s Center started Boston’s Rape Crisis Center, the first shelter for battered women in Cambridge, and held pregnancy counseling and a number of teaching and self-defense programs. At 41 years old this year, it is the oldest still-operating women’s center in the country.
In “Left on Pearl,” a lively and moving documentary by Susan Rivo (as of publication in its final editing stages), the occupation comes across as a moment of almost continual exhilaration. The women faced some opposition: a health inspector called their occupation “unsanitary.” Frank W. Tomasello, a Superior Court judge, told the Crimson, “I demand that the police get the bums out of there—As far as Women’s Liberation goes, let my wife come and shovel out my driveway as well as I do—that’s when there will be Women’s Liberation.” The Harvard Republican Club even came to protest the occupation, and a particularly funny scene in the film depicts members parading around the building with signs as women yell from the second floor, “Any women down there?...You all look silly!” But on top of the women’s considerable persistence, what’s so striking about the footage is how elated everyone was—dancing, singing, yelling and smiling. “It was probably the freest moment of my life,” one woman said in the film. Their happiness was not just excitement at a small act of transgression—it was the euphoria that comes from taking one’s own ideals seriously.
1971 was the height of women’s liberation. Even at Harvard, conversations about the role of men and women were everywhere. Reading through old archives of the Crimson, where much of this history is located, I couldn’t help but envy students of that age for being so continuously engaged in feminist activity. A few months earlier, radical separatist Ti-Grace Atkinson gave a talk to a packed law school auditorium where she yelled at her audience, “Are you going to move, are you willing to kill if you have to-at least be willing to blow up some property for Christ’s sake,” insulted other feminists (“There’s a lot in me that’s dead now that only women could have killed,”) then slipped out during the discussion that followed.
Many of the conversations on campus were less aggressive, but they retained that same energy. This was a feminism that was not afraid to offend if it meant getting women to discover their own ideals and attain them.
The issues raised by this occupation—like the difficulty of finding child care in Boston, the lack of health and self-defense resources for women, the scarcity of low-income housing—have not gone away since those women took over a Harvard building over forty years ago. Childcare is still exorbitantly expensive in Boston. Sexual assault is pervasive and its prosecution difficult. So as we appreciate the occupation of 888 Memorial Drive as an inspiring anecdote of the ’70s (as we should—the history of women’s liberation is still shamefully under-recognized), it is also time to bring this energy back to the discussions and actions that we have. What’s at stake is well worth the effort: these are issues that govern the shape of individual lives. It’s worth making a fuss—our happiness depends on it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word “snob” is of obscure origin, which accurately describes the thought process behind Rick Santorum’s latest tirade against President Obama. In Troy, Michigan (I hear Helen was quite the snob) Rick Santorum called Obama the “S word” for suggesting that Obama “wants everybody in America to go to college.” According to Santorum, matriculation in university is akin to “indoctrination,” whereby young people lose their faith and become brainwashed Obama-bots. One of the most virulent attacks on higher education heard on a campaign trail this election cycle, Santorum’s college-bashing is echoed in Mitt Romney’s continued derisive references to the “Harvard faculty lounge,” which was supposedly a place he was unfamiliar with while pursuing a joint JD and MBA degree in Cambridge. But campaign cant aside, Santorum’s broadside should make us all consider what exactly we do in college and why it is so important.
Ideally, college should perform the inverse of the process Santorum describes. He sees it as a place where people lose faith and exchange one set of positive allegiances (religion, traditional values) for another (political liberalism, secularism). Santorum’s critique of the university is not that it teaches dogmatism, but rather that it substitutes the wrong kind of faith for the one right one. But at its best, our colleges and universities do both much more and substantially less.  It is often hard to specify or remember what exactly we learn in a lecture or tutorial, but we are changed by academic work. In focusing so exclusively on the content of university education, Santorum neglects the impact of its form. To say that we should aspire to be a country where “everyone goes to college” is to insist that we try to be citizens who question rather than accept and challenge rather than parrot. As Andrew H. Delbanco ’73 notes, “in America there has been an impulse to slow things down, to extend the time for second chances and defer the day when determinative choices must be made.” It might be argued that our network of institutions of higher education constitute one of this county’s crowning achievements.
To be sure, the history of exclusion and, yes, snobbery, runs deep in many of our universities; I am typing this editorial in Lowell House, whose namesake is synonymous with quotas of many pernicious kinds. But that is precisely why Santorum’s dismissal is so problematic. As Lionel M. Trilling notes with regard to Rudyard Kipling, “he tempted liberals to be content with easy victories of right feeling and with moral self-congratulation.”  Santorum cedes too much ground when he gives up the university to those of a different political persuasion. In fact, some of the traditions that most resonantly contribute to his worldview have valued the importance of the specific kind of scholarship that intellectually, if not fiscally, funds universities. Catholic monks stewarded the glories of the Classical world into modernity. The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and, of course, Harvard, were all formed by men of faith.
If today the texts studied are secular rather than sacred, that distinction is less important than the abiding practices of inquiry and intellectual habit.  Universities are still our best bets for perpetuating the commitment to common cultural and artistic touchstones that are so important to the ongoing conversations we have with each other and ourselves. In Santorum’s dichotomous worldview, there is no room for the complexity that the most “conventional” texts can exhibit or the sense of exhilarating strangeness that comes with encountering a new philosophy or vantage point. Santorum fears a young, impressionable student falling for Chomsky and Foner and Trotsky, but might not another young student see the wisdom in Burke’s restraint, in Oakeshott’s prose, in William F. Buckley’s charm, or in Allan D. Bloom’s formidable learning?
Don’t give up on colleges, Rick; we would all be poorer for that capitulation. And for those of us privileged to study, let us remember that we participate in an enterprise that needs defending and are responsible to a set of values and way of being in the world that needs a voice. Stand up for college and alongside all those who aspire to get there.  If that makes you a snob, then I can think of no higher encomium (look it up!).

The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants in 2009 can be explained by a fall in the price of natural gas, according to an article published last month by researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The power generation sector, which typically accounts for 40 percent of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions, reduced its greenhouse gas output by 8.76 percent in 2009 relative to 2008, according to the research.
The study found that most of this reduction could be attributed to a shift from coal to natural gas—a change driven by a decrease in gas prices.
“Generating one kilowatt-hour of electricity from coal releases twice as much CO2 to the atmosphere as generating the same amount from natural gas, so a slight shift in the relative prices of coal and natural gas can result in a sharp drop in carbon emissions,” said Michael B. McElroy, the study’s lead researcher, in a SEAS press release.
McElroy, an environmental studies professor, published the article with postdoctoral researcher Xi Lu and applied math alumnus Jackson S. Salovaara ’11 in the most recent issue of Environmental Science and Technology.
The researchers developed an econometric model that divided the nation into nine different regions to account for differences in the price and patterns of power generation and usage.
Lu said that the study’s results suggest important implications for U.S. environmental and energy policy.
For example, Lu said that even a modest tax on carbon emissions could push power plants to switch to gas, which would further reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Although a carbon tax would affect power plants that use both coal and gas, the higher carbon dioxide output of coal usage would give plants a financial incentive to switch.
Lu said, however, that the article did not fully address the methods used to extract natural gas.
“The main driver of the price decrease in 2009 was from shale gas,” said Lu, referring to natural gas trapped in shale deposits and extracted through the controversial technique of hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking.”
“We are not in a position to defend shale gas as cleaner,” Lu said about lifetime-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s a very controversial topic. Some papers argue that shale gas is cleaner than coal, but other people have the opposite opinion.”
In addition to the desirable effects of decreasing carbon dioxide emissions, the article cited several other advantages of using natural gas, regardless of extraction technique. According to the research, those benefits include lower emission rates of other pollutants such as mercury and higher overall efficiency in the power sector.
“The advantage of an increase in the supply of natural gas and an associated decrease in the price of the gas relative to coal is clear,” the study said.

This spring marks the last semester of the College’s Core Curriculum, and the final numbers are in: 56 percent of this year’s seniors have chosen to graduate under the new General Education program.
The Class of 2012, the final cohort with the option of remaining under the Core, could make their choice between the two sets of curricular requirements until the final deadline on Feb. 20.
Seniors were first given the opportunity to switch to the new program when they declared their concentrations as sophomores, and they were able to change any time until last week, according to Stephanie H. Kenen, the director of the Program in General Education.
There were “very few” last minute switches, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email.
Kenen said she was not surprised at the nearly fifty-fifty split between the two programs.
“When the [Gen Ed] program was so new and untested, I was surprised that it was that high,” Kenen wrote in an email.
But several seniors said that they had expected fewer of their peers to remain under the Core.
“I feel like most of my friends are on Gen Ed, so I would’ve expected that number to be higher,” Lauren M. Mitchell ’12 wrote in an email.
Mitchell, a linguistics concentrator, chose to switch from the Core to Gen Ed after her freshman year, when she realized that she could take one fewer class to fulfill the Gen Ed requirements.
“From the few people I know who are still on Core, they complain that there aren’t very many classes offered that count for Core anymore,” Mitchell wrote. “I don’t know why anyone would switch back, unless they found a class that they really wanted to take but that counted for their old curriculum and not the new one.”
Kevin G. McNamara ’12, a computer science concentrator, said he chose to remain on the Core because it amounted to fewer requirements for him. But McNamara said that he feels that Gen Ed classes are simply “better” than Core classes.
“They’ve been phasing out so many of the Core classes that it’s kind of hard to be on the Core,” McNamara said. “If there were kids in future years that could switch to Gen Ed, I’d say, ‘Definitely switch to Gen Ed.’”
Kenen said that the Program in General Education has tried to make the transition from the Core to Gen Ed as painless as possible for students. For example, administrators made sure that all new Gen Ed classes fulfilled an area of the Core as well.
During the process, some classes transitioned seamlessly, while others were required to make revisions to their syllabi in order to fit the Gen Ed requirements.

Approximately 50 protesters gathered in front of the Holyoke Center early Thursday evening to rally against layoffs which may result from the Harvard Library’s upcoming reorganization.
“It may be raw out here, but it’s not as raw as the deal Harvard is giving its employees,” Harvard library worker Geoff P. Carens said through a megaphone to the crowd gathered in the wind and snow. “It may be cold out here, but it’s not as cold as Harvard University.”
After a series of chants and a brief musical performance, the group marched into the Yard and circled Massachusetts Hall, University Hall, and finally Widener Library before returning to the Square. The protesters marched down the center of Mass. Ave., slowing traffic for five minutes before disbanding.
On Jan. 19, Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton announced that “the library workforce will be smaller than it is now,” and that the University was considering voluntary and involuntary options to reduce staff as part of the Library’s reorganization.
Since then, groups such as the Student Labor Action Movement, Occupy Harvard, and the No Layoffs Campaign have held a variety of protest actions against staff reduction, including an occupation of Lamont Library Café last week.
On Feb. 13, the University announced a voluntary retirement package for library workers. Two weeks ago, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents library employees, proposed forming “joint councils” with library administrators to discuss the reorganization of the library.
At Thursday’s protest, Rudi E. Batzell, a doctoral student in history, told the protesters about attending a Graduate Student Council open forum earlier in the day with University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
Batzell said that while most of the forum was spent answering questions previously submitted online, it seemed to him that the administrators were expecting controversial questions about the library reorganization. According to Batzell, Garber said at the forum that it was possible that all staff reductions would be voluntary, but he refused to say for certain.
“He flew out of there,” Batzell said. “It was pretty disappointing.”
Harvard College library worker and HUCTW member Dawn M. Miller said that she attended the rally to express her concern about losing her job or her coworkers losing theirs. She said that she was hopeful that the councils would be helpful, but that the request for their formation was a “weak response” from the union that “should have happened six months ago.”
“I’ll try to be optimistic,” Miller said.
Francisco J. Maldonado ’14, who attended the rally, pointed to the fact that Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world to say that Harvard should not lay off workers.
Maldonado said he was satisfied with the way the rally turned out. “I think we got a pretty good showing in spite of this weather,” he said.

“It’s only possible in a meaningful sense to be ‘blank’ and democratic—where the blank can be fit by some ethnicity, or religion—if it respects fully the equality of citizens of the state who don’t fit into the blank,” said Harvard Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92.
Feldman was faced with the question of whether Israel can be both a Jewish state and a democratic one during the fourth annual faculty debate at the Law School on Thursday.
Feldman and Law School professor Duncan Kennedy took on the topic of religion and democracy in Israel in response to philosopher Ronald Dworkin, who recently argued that Israel is a flawed democracy because only secular states can be democracies.
In contrast to Dworkin, both Feldman and Kennedy agreed that democracy in Israel is indeed compatible with the nation’s Jewish character, as long as Israel takes care to monitor how its religious values influence its democratic process.
“I think there is [a] strong, reasonable argument to be made that the...experience of feeling excluded by religious symbols adopted by the majority derogates importantly from one’s equal citizenship,” Feldman said. “But I think that, on the whole, we could satisfy a robust definition of democracy even in the presence of those symbols.”
Feldman and Kennedy also responded to Dworkin’s claim that Israel’s Jewish character leads to an unequal status for the Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up about 20 percent of the nation.
“Almost everything you could say about what is problematic from the political point of view of the Israeli political regime could be said about the United States at one point or another as well,” Kennedy said, mentioning the United States’ historical struggles with race relations and with the influence of religious values on policy.
But Kennedy said that Israel’s current political situation does not resemble America today.
“If you are American and you just read the description of...policies that are used to get Arabs out of Jerusalem and prevent them from coming back, you would be horrified,” Kennedy said.
Responding to activists who have likened Israeli policy to that of apartheid-era South Africa, Kennedy said, “The Israeli system looks like Jim Crow, not apartheid.”
Sadaf Jaffer, a teaching fellow in South Asian studies, said that although the evening’s discussion did not conclude with suggestions for concrete solutions, she found value in the debate.
“I think it was a very respectful discussion about an important and significant philosophical and political issue,” she said.

For Lebanese contemporary media artist Walid Raad, art does not have to be grounded strictly in fact or fiction but can fall squarely on the line that divides the two.
Raad shed light on his unconventional work as a filmmaker, writer, photographer, and historian in a lecture at the Carpenter Center last Thursday.
Through his work—which ranges from video to photography to literary documents—Raad said he has created an artistic collection of historical fiction that serves as a narrative of a country that has lost much of its modern artwork to decades of war and political turmoil.
Visual and Environmental Studies professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty introduced Raad as “one of the most important artists of our time.”
“When I first saw Raad’s art, I couldn’t tell—is it a documentary [or] is it a work of fiction? All I could tell was that I just had one of the most astounding aesthetic experiences of my life,” Lambert-Beatty said.
“It shocked and amazed me—it delighted me. It touched me in a soft spot,” she added.
Raad works at the “strange and unique crossing of conceptual art, performance, filmmaking, and history,” Lambert-Beatty said.
Raad discussed his primary work from 1989 to 2004, a multimedia collection of historical fiction called “The Atlas Group,” which he attributes to the work of imaginary characters who lived through the turbulent years of the Lebanese Civil War.
In his discussion of “The Atlas Group,” Raad even found himself walking the line between fact and fiction before his audience.
“Oh, by the way, this part [of my lecture] is fact. And I don’t mean a fact in fiction; I mean an actual historical fact,” said Raad, who was met with laughter from the audience.
Throughout his talk, Raad described a series of personal anecdotes that detailed his motivation to study the history of art in the Arab world.
“If Arab art and culture had not been affected by the disasters of the past century, I would not be doing the work that I’m doing, because I wouldn’t be noticing it,” Raad said.
Raad, who is a professor at the Cooper Union School of Art, received the Hasselblad Award in 2011 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009.
“I think [“The Atlas Group”] is a really fascinating project. There should be more things like this to address the extremely traumatic moments in the history of Lebanon,” said Andrew N. C. Klein ’12.
“It was tremendously illuminating. It made me question historical fact in a direct way,” he added.

“The Western powers cannot be selective with human rights,” Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty said at a lecture at Harvard Law School on Thursday.
Shetty called for a fight against the double standard in upholding human rights in countries ranging from the U.S. to Italy to Egypt and Iran.
The U.S. interest in Saudi Arabian oil and ignorance of the country’s civilian treatment is an example of the “double standard,” a phenomenon in which governments fight against some human rights violations while ignoring others, Shetty said.
After his speech, Shetty—who serves as Amnesty International’s chief political advisor, strategist, and spokesperson—said that he encourages Harvard students to inform themselves on these humanitarian issues and unite to take action.
“Last year’s [world events] have shown us that when ordinary people come together, they can make extraordinary change happen,” he said.
“Students need to know that they are not alone, and they are not helpless.”
While his talk focused on the international realm, Shetty said that Harvard students could also look for these violations in their local politics.
One such “embarrassing” violation that Shetty suggested students could protest was the U.S. death penalty.
“You can make errors in the way in which you sentence people. It is a one way ticket,” he said. “The other big executioners are Saudi Arabia, China, Belarus, and Iran. Do you think that the United States should be in this company?”
Shetty also focused on the advance of human rights in developing countries such as China, South Africa, and Brazil.
“Without human rights, true long-term stability can never be achieved,” he said. “That is a lesson that governments seem very reluctant to learn.”
HLS student Marcus J. Eldridge echoed Shetty’s sentiments.
“Is China strategizing to have a role that is commensurate with their economic clout?” he asked. “As their internal governance evolves, how will they behave on the intellectual stage with regards to human rights?”
Despite the violations that have not been ameliorated, Shetty is hopeful for the future of other developing nations.
“I’m generally optimistic about the way that the world is moving,” he said. “It won’t be easy, and we won’t suddenly jump to perfection. No developing country emerged without a struggle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In physics and applied physics professor Eric Mazur’s classes, hundreds of students debate physics problems in small groups, consulting their laptops and phones as they search for the right answer.
This unusual teaching method is called peer instruction, and Mazur is just one of the many professors at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to employ unusual pedagogical styles in recent years.
Mazur developed his peer instruction method in 1991 after tests revealed that his students had not effectively absorbed many of the fundamental concepts taught in his physics courses. He said he concluded that students were not sufficiently engaging with the material and were earning passing grades through rote memorization.
“That is not what education is,” Mazur said. “That ‘aha’ moment when you understand the material rarely happens during lecture.”
His new method offered an alternative to the traditional lecture model of teaching. Through hands-on activities, it encourages students to think critically about the material presented in class.
To prepare for Mazur’s unique classes, students learn conceptual basics on their own by reading pre-lectures posted on the course website.
“What I am advocating is really moving information transfer out of the classroom. That’s the easy part. We need to focus attention on the difficult parts by actually practicing concepts in class,”  Mazur said.
According to Mazur, the strength of the method is that students are given the opportunity to learn from their peers rather than the professor, whose familiarity with the material might prevent him or her from understanding a student’s problem.
“When I teach a lecture course, I teach by questioning,” Mazur added. “I ask students to interact with one another and discuss things under my guidance.”
Standardized assessments have shown that this alternative method  drastically increases students’ retention of information, Mazur said.
The idea of active, hands-on learning has caught on quickly at SEAS as dozens of professors take increasingly innovative approaches to pedagogy.
SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray said that she is a “champion” of new teaching styles and welcomes faculty to use creative methods in their classrooms.
“The SEAS faculty is very interested in new methods of teaching and learning,”  Murray said. “Some of them will be experiments. They might not all work out too well but we’ll learn.”
In classes such as Engineering Sciences 51: “Computer-Aided Machine Design,” students learn the fundamentals of the engineering design process through hands-on projects. Students spend a significant amount of class time in front of computer models or building and designing objects, including catapults and cars, in the School’s machine shop.
The goal, Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering assistant professor Conor J. Walsh said, is to encourage students to see that real-world challenges can be tackled by applying material learned in the classroom.
“Active learning is very much related to hands-on design education,” said Walsh. “If you only have problem-set based learning, you get the idea that you can tackle your problems by just pulling an all-nighter. Instead, we challenge the students—and ask them to use everything that we’ve taught—to solve it.”
As Walsh explained, students grow intellectually by troubleshooting and  correcting their own mistakes, experiences which help them become better project managers and designers.
Some classes, such as the advanced laboratory course Physics 191r, have eliminated their lecture component completely. In the class, students work together to conduct and analyze famous experiments.
“It’s very individualized and personal. A class like this shows you what it’s like to be a real researcher doing experimental physics in a lab,” said David A. Rosengarten ’12, a student taking the course.
Several students expressed enthusiasm for creative teaching methods.
“I definitely like the teaching model in which a substantial portion of the learning occurs beyond lecture,” Collin A. Rees ’12 wrote in an email. Rees is an Engineering Sciences 51 teaching fellow and took the course last fall.
“You always walk out of lab having accomplished something. Being a Mechanical Engineering concentrator, it made me fall in love with my concentration again and again,” said Nancy E. De Haro ’13, who took ES51 last spring.
But other students voiced concerns about the practicality of such methods.
Carina R. Fish ’13, who took Mazur’s Physics 11b class last spring, said that Mazur’s unconventional structure did not always lead to a better understanding of the material. “If the whole class was lost, real learning would never happen,” she said.
“The problem with this class was it took a very ‘perfectionistic’ approach to learning,” Ariana M. Saxby ’13, who also took Physics 11b, wrote in an email. “If you didn’t get a chance to do all the reading, however, class time felt useless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four female dancers in brightly colored skirts with bells wrapped around their ankles danced gracefully to a Classical Indian song at Agassiz Theatre Thursday night in the twenty-third annual production of Ghungroo.
Ghungroo, a showcase of South Asian dance and music produced by the Harvard South Asian Association, is Harvard’s largest student-run production. This year more than 380 students participated in the production, according to the SAA website.
The showcase’s music included traditional North and South Indian numbers as well as songs from Bollywood films and contemporary American pop tunes, such as Katy Perry’s “California Gurls.”
One of the acts, titled “Hindi Film,” was a dynamic, upbeat dance performed to Bollywood songs. Female dancers wore blue, green, and pink sarongs as they energetically danced in time with male dancers clothed in blue tunics and pink head scarves.
Many in attendance said that Raas, a traditional Indian folk dance from Western India, ranked among their favorite performances. Female dancers started the dance and were soon joined by male dancers in orange and silver striped tunics. They twirled and clapped sticks called dandiyas together in a very active, fast-paced dance.
Some of the dancers faced difficulties in learning to use dandiyas. “There’s a very high initial barrier [to learning the dance] because you have to learn how to spin the sticks,” dancer Arjun M. Nandkishore ’13 said.
Musical performances, such as an a cappella love song, and a five-act play provided brief interludes between numbers.
The play, titled “When Love Goes to Bollywood,” followed the story of a girl named Sheila Saxena, who is in love with a Bollywood superstar, Rahul Oberoi. To capture his heart, Sheila Saxena must become a star herself, so she enlists the help of Luv Prasad, a timid boy that has been in love with her for years. The short comedy had the audience roaring as Sheila Saxena’s over-the-top friend narrated the Bollywood-style romance.
Audience member Marina Molarsky-Beck ’15 described the show as “exciting, energetic, and fun.”
A short solo dance act that was not on the program garnered much cheering and clapping from the audience. The stage lights were turned off as a dancer dressed in all black cracked blue and green glow sticks. Twirling them to an upbeat Indian song, the dancer made rings of light around his body.
The two-hour long show drew to a close with a dance performed by the seniors in the cast. Female dancers in sparkling gold tops and loose black pants and male dancers in glittering blue tunics and matching gold pants danced enthusiastically to a mash up of South Asian songs. The number ended with the dancers chanting “2012.”
Many of the dancers worked for over five weeks on their acts, and the tech team worked on the set for over a month.
Alexa S. Fishman ’13, who attended the opening, said that she appreciated the show’s cultural diversity.
“I come from an area that is not as diverse as Harvard. Seeing something like Ghungroo is a novel experience. All the variety is really incredible,” Fishman said.

Creative expression can play a major role in the process of recovering from eating disorders, said artist Judith Shaw, who exhibited a collection of pieces inspired by her own struggle with anorexia alongside an exhibition of student work at the Student Organization Center at Hilles on Thursday.
Shaw, who said she never considered herself an artist before her disease, first showed her collection at an art gallery in St. Louis. After a viewer encouraged her to bring her work to students, she exhibited it at schools across the country.
Shaw says she was stunned by students’ positive response to her work. She attributed their curiosity to the fact that many affected by eating disorders suffer in silence.
“It’s a very hard illness to get a grasp on,” Shaw said. “My work takes a mental illness and translates it into something concrete that someone can begin to understand.”
SOCH curator Kristen L. Cronon ’12 said the collaboration with Shaw coincided with an existing initiative to create a student exhibit focusing on bodies, noting that the two collections were united by central themes of self-perception and a struggle with body image. The eventual joint exhibit was titled “Body of Work.”
“The common thread is the idea of creative expression as a means of processing bodily vulnerability,” Cronon said.
The event was co-sponsored by Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, the Peer Contraceptive Councilors, and Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard College.
“Body of Work” was not the first time student art at the SOCH has centered on a social or political issue, said Cronon, who noted that a past SOCH exhibit on homes and domestic spaces served as the forum for a broader discussion about homelessness.
“I’m pretty into art as activism,” Cronon said, stressing the importance of a dialogue about eating disorders at perfection-driven colleges like Harvard.
“Eating disorders are especially prevalent in high-pressure environments,” she said.
Jennifer L. Maggio ’12, who contributed the piece “Lips” to the exhibit, echoed Cronon’s concerns, pointing to anonymous posts from people struggling with eating disorders on websites like HarvardFML as evidence that a more open and public conversation about the issue is needed on campus,
“I think it’s definitely an important theme to address, especially at a college where you have a lot of stress to be the perfect boy or the perfect girl, and physical image is a big part of that,” she said.
“Hopefully people recognize this issue, are more sensitive to it, and realize that expressing yourself in an artistic way is another method of healing yourself,” Maggio said.
Speaking to the role of artistic expression in the healing process, Shaw contrasted her low self-worth during her illness with the sense of empowerment she derived from her work. “I felt so imperfect and so flawed,” she said.
Now, she said, “I just feel fearless.”

On Thursday night, the Institute of Politics hosted the premiere screening of “Game Change,” an HBO film based on the best-selling book that chronicles the 2008 presidential race.
While the book examined the Republican and Democratic nominations in addition to the general election, the film chose to focus on the campaign of Republicans John McCain and Sarah Palin.
In a panel discussion after the film screening, filmmakers explained how they selected parts of the book to highlight in the film.
“There were lots of stories in the book, and we were initially interested in doing the Hillary and Obama story...but it didn’t really pop in a way that we felt was going to really gain momentum,” said Len Amato, the president of HBO Films.
The film highlighted Palin’s experience campaigning alongside McCain. Amato said that HBO felt that Palin’s surprising nomination and the fallout that ensued afterward made for a poignant story line.
“The Palin story had all the elements that make a great story: a compact time frame, colorful characters, an underdog story—it has elements that are very relatable,” he said.
Mark E. Halperin ’87 and Harvard Kennedy School graduate John A. Heilemann, the two journalists who co-authored the book, also sat on the post-screening panel. The authors said that they were impressed overall with HBO’s treatment of their book.
In an interview prior to the screening, Halperin and Heilemann said that they had an “elaborate relationship” with the director and screenwriter of the film. The pair said that they worked very closely with the filmmakers to ensure that the movie accurately captured the emotional energy of the campaign.
Halperin is Time Magazine’s senior political analyst, and Heilemann writes politics pieces for New York magazine.
Heilemann said that the book emphasized the “human” aspect of the race.
“We tried to get as far behind the curtain as we could, to tell this as a deeply human story, and to show how these famous people experienced the campaign,” he said, adding that the movie took a similar approach.
During the panel discussion, audience members asked the authors to respond to the charges of bias and inaccuracy some have made against the movie.
Halperin pointed out that many of those critics have yet to watch the film and also noted extensive interviews with campaign insiders that supported the film’s representations.
“As with the book, [the film] was based not on opinion or analysis, but reported facts,” Halperin said.
Halperin and Heilemann said that they conducted over 350 interviews with those involved in the campaigns for their book. Screenwriter Danny Strong did additional research on McCain and Palin just for the film.
“The book and the film are as balanced, accurate, and fair a portrayal of Sarah Palin in those 60 days as anything that’s been done,” Halperin said. “There are many favorable things to be said about the job she did, and about the difficult challenges she faced...and there is a lot to Palin that is polarizing.”

In April 2009, five rookie softball players watched their Ivy League season end with back-to-back losses to Dartmouth—two defeats that kept their team from an Ivy League Championship Series.
As sophomores, the five experienced even greater heartbreak: losing the league title in a third and decisive game, 3-2, against rival Cornell.
Finally, as juniors, the five got their rings, taking the title in a two-game sweep of the Big Red, only to be blanked, 10-0 and 7-0, in the NCAA Regional Round against Arizona and Texas Tech, respectively.
Since the beginning of their Harvard careers, this season’s seniors—Jane Alexander, Rachel Brown, Eve Rosenbaum, Whitney Shaw, and Marika Zumbro—have set their sights and met ever-higher goals. And they’re looking to make 2012 no exception.
“We’re a team that takes it to the next level,” Rosenbaum said. “Freshman year, we didn’t make it to the [Ivy League] Championship…and junior year we won it. It only makes sense for us to…win at NCAA Regionals.”
Although the seniors share a similar goal for the season, they come from a variety of backgrounds off the field and a variety of positions on it. Brown leads the team from the mound, Alexander and Shaw control the infield, Rosenbaum catches behind the plate, and Zumbro contributes on the field wherever she is needed as a utility player. Their hometowns range from California to Maryland, their concentrations from Psychology to Visual and Environmental Studies, and their leadership styles from vocal to understated.
“I think one of the best things about our class is that we have so many different individual strengths, and we complement each other well,” said Brown, who is serving as co-captain with Shaw. “We can inspire and motivate the team, keep the game fun, and also maintain a good team chemistry.”
Aside from generating team unity, the senior class also provides leadership in pressure-packed situations, a role that is integral to the program’s success, according to Harvard coach Jenny Allard.
But keying the squad to success is nothing new to the Crimson’s group of veterans.  In her freshman season, Brown was tabbed the Ivy League Rookie of the Year for her performance on the mound and was voted to the All-Ivy First Team. She followed that rookie feat with consecutive unanimous first-team All-Ivy accolades her sophomore and junior years, with the added bonus of Ivy League Pitcher of the Year and Academic All-Ivy League in the 2011 season. Shaw, Zumbro and Alexander have also earned All-Ivy recognition for their achievements at the plate and in the field.
“[The seniors] have all matured individually,” Allard said. “Rachel had a tremendous impact even as a freshman...Jane has done a tremendous job taking the reins with the freshmen…and Eve has been a tremendous role player for us and really pushes our pitchers.”
As the senior class has grown over the past four years, so has conference play in the Ivy League. The teams in the Ancient Eight increased the number of games played from 14 in 2006 to 20 in the 2011 season. The longer season allowed for a higher level of competition between the teams that helped ensure that no one team dominated. There are more upsets, more heartbreaks and more evenly matched schedules.
“The league is much more anyone’s game now,” Shaw said. “That’s why we need to face every opponent as if they’re the toughest opponent we’ve faced so far, regardless of the name on their jersey.”
Playing more Ivy League games has allowed each team to become more competitive, but, as shown by its increasingly strong record, Harvard has risen above the Ancient Eight pack and, for the first time since the 2002 season, has a chance for back-to-back championships.
And as Allard said, it all comes back to the seniors, who  will need both their individual skill and team unity to capture those elusive NCAA Regional wins.
Victory at that level would accomplish a major goal which, even at the beginning of the season, sits in the back of the collective mind of the senior class: cementing a legacy.
“We want to create the dynasty we all dreamed about creating when first signed up to play Harvard softball,” Shaw said.
“I hope we can instill in the team a belief that Harvard softball can do so much more than just dominate the Ivy League,” Brown echoed. “This team has the potential to win Regionals, and I hope that this becomes a permanent goal of the Harvard softball program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the start of the 2012 campaign still a few weeks away, junior captain Andrew Ferreira has already gotten a taste of tough competition. During a recent in-practice scrimmage, the left-handed pitcher was matched up against a familiar face. And when freshman catcher Ethan Ferreira—Andrew’s younger brother—stepped up to the plate, the Harvard baseball team took immediate notice of the imminent display of sibling rivalry.
“You could just sense it,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh recounted. “Andrew’s on the mound, Ethan’s coming to the plate, and all eyes are on the two of them, knowing this is a brother battle.”
Four pitches later, with the count knotted, 2-2, Andrew hurled one more toward his brother. Ball three.
“I thought it was a strike,” Walsh said. “But the umpire calls it a ball, and you could just see Andrew going like, ‘I had that pitch.’ And the next pitch, Ethan got it all. I thought there was going to be a hole in the bubble [that covers Harvard Stadium during the winter months].”
Ethan rounded the bases—an uncustomary act during a scrimmage in the indoor facility—and play resumed as usual.
“The dynamic [between the two brothers] is amazing,” Walsh said. “They keep it quiet, but we had a good confrontation in practice.... You could see the smoke coming out of Andrew’s ears, yet I think he was also pretty happy for Ethan.”
A semester into college life, Ethan credits Andrew for much of his speedy transition to baseball at Harvard.
“It’s pretty sweet having an older brother who’s the captain of the baseball team,” Ethan said. “I’ve never really been away from home much, and having him on the team—it’s even better because I’ve never really played with him [until now]. I always feel him watching me when I’m playing, making sure I’m getting better.”
The benefits appear to be mutual. With one pitcher and one catcher in the family, the Rehoboth, Mass. natives play to each other’s strengths.
“It’s amazing, you know, when you have an older brother who’s a pitcher, the younger brother becomes a catcher,” Walsh said. “It happens all the time. It’s like, ‘Okay, we need you to catch him.’”
But according to Andrew, his brother’s penchant for catching is a sort of family tradition—their father, Roger, was a catcher at Providence College—and in fact, both brothers started out playing behind home plate.
“Growing up, I was always a catcher,” Andrew said. “But being left handed, it couldn’t work out, so once I got a little older, I gravitated toward pitching.”
“Since [Ethan] was right handed, he could be a catcher,” he continued. “He just took after my dad, and it kind of worked out with us pitching and catching. It makes it fun.”
In high school, Ethan was a Gatorade Player of the Year nominee in both baseball and football, helping his teams to a total of three state championships, including two in baseball, during his four years at Bishop Hendricken. But playing in college offers additional challenges.
“The game’s definitely faster [in college],” Ethan said. “Having a kid that’s been on the team for three years and is the captain now—he’s obviously a role model for other people—definitely made the transition a lot smoother. ”
Coming off of a season in which Andrew was sidelined due to Tommy John surgery, the elder Ferreira is himself no stranger to adversity. The junior had a solid freshman campaign in 2010, including one Ivy League Rookie of the Week nod and a no-hitter against BC, and he looks to pick up where he left off in the coming season.
Fully recovered from the surgery, Andrew has stepped into a leadership role as the Crimson’s sole captain in 2012.
“It’s been fun,” Andrew said. “[Being a captain] has definitely been a new experience, especially because I missed last year [due to injury]. It was kind of tough sitting back.”
And according to Walsh, Andrew might see time as a designated hitter for the Crimson in addition to time on the mound.
“We call [Andrew] ‘Tim Tebow’ with his work ethic,” Walsh said. “But Andrew’s been showing some good power on a right-handed bat. I’ve got a lot of tough decisions to make, which I welcome.”
Although the Crimson played to a disappointing 9-36 overall mark last year, Harvard’s aim this season remains the same.
“The goal is to win the championship,” Andrew noted. “We’ve been working since day one, and I think we’ve really begun to turn the tide. Our attitude’s been better, and we’ve all been working our butts off.”
In Walsh’s eyes, the toughness and athleticism both Andrew and Ethan bring to the table will be instrumental in any success the Crimson has this season.
“They’re two of the best athletes,” Walsh said. “I think they could go play any sport here at Harvard, the two of them. What they bring to the team is definitely some toughness, and we need that.”
But regardless of outcome, the Ferreira brothers relish the opportunity to play on the same team.
“I haven’t played with [Ethan] since I was 11,” Andrew said. “It’s been fun. I definitely enjoy every moment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sophomore slump.
Whether it hits in sports, music, movies, or academics, it’s an unpleasant phenomenon that happens to the best. Just take a look at “Dumb and Dumberer,” MGMT’s “Congratulations,” and the transcripts of many first-semester sophomores.
That said, the second-year blues aren’t expected to be a problem for third baseman Kasey Lange.
While many players coming off a stellar freshman season often find their second year particularly stressful because of the pressure to live up to the previous season’s success, Lange sees it as just the opposite.
“It’s really good to have the freshman jitters out of my system,” Lange said. “I feel more established now, like I don’t necessarily have to prove myself as much. As a freshman, there’s always this thought in the back of your mind, ‘No one knows who I am,’ but now I don’t have to worry about what other people think of me.”
Last season, Lange’s best turned out to be among the top in the Ancient Eight, as she was unanimously voted Ivy League Rookie of the Year, leading the league in doubles (20), RBI (65), and total bases (123). Lange also earned a spot on the All-Ivy First Team and set new season records for the Crimson in RBI and doubles.
Yet despite her success in accumulating stats and breaking records, Lange is far more concerned with garnering achievements for the team as a whole.
“I don’t really care about individual stats,” Lange said. “I’m happy just as long as we as a team come out with a win at the end of the day. It doesn’t matter if I finish 3-for-3 or 1-for-3, as long as my team pulls out with a ‘W.’”
For Lange, the highlight of her freshman season wasn’t the game in which she belted a grand slam or the day that she was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Instead, it was the weekend that the Crimson won the Ancient Eight championship. When asked if that was because she played particularly well, she smiled.
“No, it’s because we played well together as a team,” she said.
Having such a strong team mentality is especially important to Lange. The sophomore believes that during such a pressure-filled rookie season, it was her teammates’ support that helped her settle into her position, where she started all 50 games.
“It was awesome having such a veteran infield around me last year,” Lange said. “I was the baby of the infield, and they were all like my mini coaches. They really taught me a lot about stepping up at the collegiate level.”
Now, playing as a sophomore, Lange has her own opportunity to be a mentor to the seven members of this year’s freshman class.
Several of the rookies live near Lange’s home in Ladera Ranch, Calif., and she was even able to meet with freshman pitcher Gabby Ruiz over the summer to talk about Harvard.
“I’ve definitely been trying to help the freshmen out,” Lange said. “I really hope I can be a person for them to look up to and come to for advice.”
Though Harvard’s season officially came to a close in May when the squad was knocked out of the NCAA tournament in the regional stage, Lange worked out throughout the summer and during the pre-season to keep her momentum going.
The time and effort she put in over the last months appears to be paying off, according to teammates.
“Kasey has been looking great in the pre-season,” senior pitcher Rachel Brown said. “I hate pitching to her because she’s just dangerous in the batter’s box because of her good eye and quick hands. I have no doubt that she will continue her successful career this year.”
The second-year blues can happen to just about anyone.
But when you’re Kasey Lange, and you’ve been playing like a seasoned veteran since your freshman year, that sophomore season may prove to be far from a slump.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What are you doing this summer?”
Most people will mention some internship or an adventure abroad, but the Harvard baseball team has a different norm: playing ball.
“It’s a culture,” said junior first baseman Robert Wineski, who has spent his last two summers playing in a Hawaiian baseball league. “Everyone on the team has done it at least once. [Harvard] coach [Joe] Walsh stresses it. The coaches really push you to play in a summer league…. I don’t know a kid who played four years of Harvard baseball and didn’t play in a summer league.”
“When you’re playing on these summer teams, you’re playing with and against guys from other major colleges,” Walsh said. “When you have some success there, you bring that confidence back each year.”
In the leagues, ballplayers from all over the country suit up for as many games—sometimes more—in the summer as they do in a collegiate season. Their weeks revolve around baseball, and depending on the league in which they play, they suit up almost every day of the summer.
“If you go 0-4 on a Sunday in the Ivy League, you have to wait until Saturday to get up again, and it’s tough,” Walsh said. “But during the summer, just playing each day and getting practice…can really help you.”
The process of finding summer teams starts for Harvard in the fall when the coaches place players in various leagues across the country, choosing spots where they feel the players would best fit.
In the six-week-long Hawaiian league, Wineski, along with fellow juniors Kyle Larrow and Jordan Haviland, played baseball games six days a week while living in the same hotel with the rest of the league’s players.
“It’s just the way I think the game is supposed to be played—lots of games,” Wineski said. “You just roll out and have a great time.... And imagine being in a hotel with a hundred guys in Hawaii looking to have a very good time.”
But not all programs are the same.
Junior pitcher Joey Novak had a much different experience in the Northwoods League in Minnesota, which plays 70 games over the course of 10 weeks.
“You get in a routine where, if you’re at home, you wake up pretty late, you hang out, you go to the field at three, do some batting practice, go get some food, come back, get ready for the game, play,” Novak said. “After the game, heat and then get a lift in, maybe. Then you go back and go to sleep.”
Unlike the Hawaiian League that plays all of its games in the same general area, the Northwoods League includes roadtrips that average three hours.
“There are a lot of hotel rooms where you’re just kind of waiting around,” Novak recalled. “Everything’s revolving around playing every day.”
Though the summer leagues can be intense, Walsh feels they are vital to a player’s and a team’s success.
“Baseball is a game that when you’re playing on a daily basis, that’s when you make your improvements,” he said. “I’ll be giving Joey a start [against the University of Arizona this weekend] just based on what he did during the summer…. His fastball really improved throwing every day.”
Senior pitcher Brent Suter—who played in the top-tier Cape Cod League with classmate Jeff Reynolds last summer—agreed.
“I was struggling mechanically a lot last season, and the pitching coach [in Cape Cod] really helped me a lot,” Suter said. “By the end of the summer, I felt it was coming together for me.”
But no matter the level of play or location, the player consensus is that one of the best parts about playing over the summer is the people.
“Just meeting all these kids from different parts of the country and from all these different schools is so great,” Wineski said. “I mean, I still talk to kids from two summers back.... You build this network of friends. That’s by far the biggest thing I’ve taken away from these summers—the relationships I’ve built with all these other kids.”
Though Wineski and the rest of the Hawaiian League stayed in a hotel together, in most other leagues, players reside with host families. Suter, whose host family had two young boys, grew close with his host brothers.
“It was great just going to the beach with them, hanging out, playing video games,” he recalled. “Everyday activities were really special.”
While the players sacrifice their summers in order to improve their game for Harvard and, in some cases, to get drafted, Walsh believes in the experience that the leagues present his players.
“It’s a lot better than going to Wall Street,” Walsh said. “And you can print that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The butterflies were out in full force for then-junior Rachel Brown as she took the mound to begin the Ivy League Championship Series against Cornell last May.
“I was definitely nervous,” Brown said. “It was one of the most nerve-wracking games I’ve ever pitched in.”
For three years, the Big Red had Brown’s number. In her first matchup against Cornell as a freshman, Brown was so nervous that she plunked the first two batters she faced in what would be a losing effort.
At the end of Brown’s sophomore campaign, the Big Red scored three runs against Brown to win the first game in the Ivy League Championship Series. Cornell went on to win the series, 2-1, claiming a second straight Ivy title. Brown was unable to exact retribution in the following matchup in the middle of last year, as the Big Red tallied six runs against her in an 8-1 win.
In the 2011 Ivy League Championship Series preview, the Cornell Athletics Department wrote that the squad’s ace, then-senior Elizabeth Dalrymple, “has had more success against the Crimson over her career than Brown has had against the Big Red,” which was undoubtedly true. But Brown was ready to rewrite the script.
The junior forced a groundout to record the first out of the opening game and immediately gained confidence, striking out the final two batters of the inning. Brown recorded a three-hit shutout in the 5-0 win, overcoming her demons and giving Harvard a great chance to return to the NCAA Championships for the first time since 2007.
“I was absolutely thrilled,” Brown said. “I proved to myself that I could overcome the mental block that I had with that team.”
She came up big again on the following day. Sophomore Laura Ricciardione had pitched five shutout innings to start Game 2 but was taken out because her knee was bothering her, according to Brown. Harvard coach Jenny Allard called on Brown to step in for the starter and seal the deal. She struck out five of the nine batters she faced to secure a 4-0 win.
“The last at-bat seemed to be the longest at-bat I’d ever pitched,” Brown said. “I remember seeing her swing and miss…and immediately running to the catcher before turning to our seniors. They were just so happy.”
Brown’s strong performance during the weekend earned her the Ivy League Pitcher of the Year award over Cornell’s Dalrymple, who took home the distinction in the previous two seasons.
“Being honored as Pitcher of the Year was a direct result of how she threw in the championship series,” Allard said. “She had some mental struggles against Cornell and really just focused and kept working through them and completely dominated and shut them out in the championship series. She had to break through another level in her pitching and she did that.”
After the post-championship euphoria subsided, the softball team traveled to Tuscon, Ariz. for the NCAA Championship Regional Tournament. There, the squad was humbled by Arizona and Texas Tech, losing both games by a combined score of 17-0 before flying back home.
Coming into this year, Brown and the Crimson are looking to get another bid to the tournament and make a dent on the national stage.
“Last year, we viewed every extra game as a bonus,” Brown said. “This year, it’s our chance to prove we can do so much more in regionals. My motivation is getting back there and doing whatever I can to lead my team to regionals.”
Even after winning Ivy League Pitcher of the Year honors and hoisting the conference title, Brown is still motivated by being spurned by a number of top programs as a high school senior.
“It instilled me with a fire to compete because I was overlooked by a bunch of programs,” Brown said. “I think I personally have something to prove. It really motivates me to show other teams what I can do.”
After setting the Ivy League strikeout record last year, Brown has spent the offseason seeking to add to her game.
“After pitching in this league for three years, I have to assume that batters know what my pitches are so I‘ve really been working to add a couple pitches and bolster my repertoire.”
Beyond gaining confidence at the end of last year and adding to her toolbox this offseason, Brown has also hit the weights, according to Allard.
“This is the strongest I’ve seen her physically in her four years,” Allard said. “That’ll be important for her to be able to throw a lot of innings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
FOR LOVE OF THE GAME
“We’ve just had so many guys, including Frank [Herrmann ’06], who just have that love and passion for baseball. I think that’s what separates so many of our players, whether they had great seasons here or not. It’s a game you grow up with as a child; it’s a game that stays with you. And that game of catch that you play in your backyard with your son or daughter is always going to be memorable. I think that’s what makes baseball so special.
Seeing a guy up in the Big Leagues from Harvard—that’s what everybody’s experiencing with Jeremy Lin right now—you all share in that. All of us at Harvard baseball share that with Frank. He’s been very humble about it. He knows the difference between somebody else getting the shot up there and somebody else making it.
As a hitter, it can be one ground ball that gets through per week and that’s the difference between being a .260 hitter and a .350 hitter. As a pitcher, that guy that took you deep, if he’s this much underneath the ball, it’s a pop up.
It’s such a game of inches, it’s incredible. Whoever came up with 90 feet? Every play is a bang-banger at first base. Why wasn’t it 85 feet? And who came up with 60 feet, six inches? If it was further back, it’d be such an advantage for hitters. If it was further up, it would be all pitching. It was just the perfect measurements. No one has ever messed with it; it’s just amazing.
I think everybody appreciates that, and when they’re looking at a box score, they’re not only seeing Frank Hermann, they’re seeing themselves and going back to playing ball.
It’s something they can never take away from you, and I tell the guys that every year. When you leave here and they send you out to those concrete caves where you’re pushing a pencil around and reading the Wall Street Journal every day, once Feb. 1 comes, you start thinking of baseball. And that happens to everybody, anyone who’s played this game. Deep inside, I know you guys are baseball fans too.”
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER
“We’re not sending these guys out [to summer leagues] just to improve for Harvard, but we’re sending these guys out to represent the school as well as to have some great experiences. I remember Trey Hendricks [’04] a few years ago who was drafted [after college]. Trey was from Houston, Texas and played…as a freshman in the New England Collegiate League [over the summer]. His sophomore summer he played in Alaska. His junior summer he played down the Cape.
The career placement services at Harvard called him and were saying, ‘You have to do something for your resume.’ I remember knocking on the door there and walking in there and saying, ‘Excuse me, but I’m Joe Walsh, the baseball coach, and I’d like to have a little personal chat with you.’ I said, ‘Are you kidding me?’
This is about the experience that he’s had. A kid from Houston, coming to Boston, playing in Northern New England, living on a farm with a family, and then going up to Alaska for a summer? Trey was fishing at two in the morning with the Land of the Midnight Sun out there and living with a family from Alaska. And then, his junior year playing on the Cape and getting drafted? That’s a lot better than picking out ties for some law firm at lunchtime and making copies, saying that you worked in a law firm. So our guys going out and playing summer baseball is huge, and I’m counting on that to be a big plus for our team this year. I’m looking forward to keeping that edge every year.”
WARMING UP TO THE SEASON
“When you get out there [to a warm climate to play baseball], you need to make a decision whether to put the sun block on when you get out of the hotel, or do you put it on when you get to the field? Playing in warm weather is something that gets anybody excited and going to Arizona and Florida and playing a game of baseball in the warm weather.... I don’t have to tell you what it’s like in the spring back home when the cold’s running through you. So getting away isn’t all that bad.
But there’s going to be some challenges. We’re going to see guys on the mound that we don’t know about, that we haven’t seen. That Arizona team’s going to be filled with future draft choices and guys that can flat out play. There are going to be 3,000-4,000 fans all over us, but I like that environment, and I’m hoping our team responds to it. It’s just part of being a New England ballplayer, but I think guys that come here, they want to play that type of schedule.
I remember when I first got here I looked at the schedule, and we were playing Division III teams down in Florida. The first call I made was to the University of Miami down in Florida, who were the National Champions, and I said, ‘You guys have been ducking us. When are we going to play?’ I got my three-game series. When I got back to the team, I looked at everybody’s faces, and the ones that went, ‘Yeah, we’ve got a good team,’ those were the guys I wanted.... I think the guys get excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season was one to remember for the Harvard softball team.  Sweeping Cornell in the Ivy League Championship Series, the Crimson earned its fifth Ancient Eight title. The win also garnered Harvard a bid to the 2011 NCAA Regional tournament for only the fourth time in the program’s illustrious history.
But while matching last year’s success might seem like something to strive for this season, the team is aiming even higher.
“The team’s goal for this season is to go 22-0,” co-captain Rachel Brown said.  “We hope to be .750 in preseason and to win Regionals and advance to Super Regionals.”
Last year, the Crimson finished with an 18-2 record in conference play, going 36-14 overall—a new school record for victories in a season.  Harvard suffered two consecutive losses in the NCAA tournament and was outscored, 17-0.  Although both were difficult losses for the players, Harvard coach Jenny Allard expressed how much motivation they have provided for the team this spring.
“We were really humbled going to regionals [last season], and we realized, ‘Okay, as strong as we were in our conference, there’s a whole other level we need to get to,’” Allard said.  “That is what has pushed us this fall.... We want to play at the regional level, and that’s a great benchmark for us to get to.”
The 2010-11 Harvard squad was also honored with multiple league awards. Ten Crimson players were named to the All-Ivy first or second teams, tying the program record.  Second baseman Ellen Macadam ’11 was named Ivy League Player of the Year, and third baseman Kasey Lange was the unanimous selection for Rookie of the Year.
Pitcher Rachel Brown also shined last season for the Crimson. The righty from San Diego led the Ancient Eight in strikeouts (299), shutouts (7), wins (21), and opposing batting average (.185). For her efforts, Brown was unanimously selected as the Ivy League Pitcher of the Year.
“[Pitcher of the Year] was a tribute to how the coaches in the league really respect [Brown],” Allard said.  “She was an impact player.”
Allard credits Brown’s success to her calm game-day demeanor.
“She’s pretty relaxed and very focused,” Allard said.  “Her game plan is knowing her motion, knowing her pitches…. Of all the pitchers I’ve trained…she has been the most in tune to her technique.”
Another key Harvard pitcher is Laura Ricciardone, a sophomore from Humble, Texas. Ricciardone was named to the All-Ivy League Second Team in 2011 and earned a victory in the second and final game of the Ivy League Championship Series against Cornell.
“In Rachel and Laura, we have two of the strongest and best pitchers in the conference,” Allard said.  “One pitcher cannot win a conference title…. We have the strength in both of them.  The one-two punch of Rachel and Laura is enormous to our success.”
This season, Brown and Ricciardone will need to be dominant once again if the squad wants to repeat last season’s success.
According to Allard, the competition this year in the Ivy League will be much tougher than last season.  Allard attributed part of this parity to the strong freshman recruiting classes for all of the schools in the Ancient Eight.
“Coaches are doing a great job of recruiting good players,” Allard explained.  “And with the success the Ivy League has had, more players are being attracted to play in [our conference].”
The influx of freshman talent doesn’t faze Brown.  Although she acknowledges that this season is sure to be difficult, she believes that the Crimson will be the best team in the Ivy League once again.
“One of our greatest strengths is the depth of our roster,” Brown said.  “This team also has a great work ethic, and we have been working hard all summer and fall to put ourselves in the best position possible for the upcoming season.”
Harvard will rely on its five seniors to lead the team to its second consecutive championship, a feat that hasn’t been accomplished in the program since the 2000 and 2001 seasons.
“I think in any successful season, your seniors are very pivotal,” Allard said. “You want them up with the game on the line…. Every year we’ve been successful and won a championship, it’s always come back to having seniors that have stepped up in key situations, so they’re going to be a big factor in the outcome of our year.”
The Crimson will play its season opener on Friday in the South Florida Tournament, and begins Ivy League play on Mar. 30 at Cornell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
People love rooting for the underdog.
And the Harvard baseball team is starting off the year as the ultimate underdog.
After going 9-36 on the 2011 season, 5-15 in the Ivy League, and 1-10 in its first two weeks of play last year, the Crimson has nowhere to go but up. But according to the squad’s veteran coach of 16 years, that isn’t much of a concern.
“We’ve been predicted to finish in last place in the league, whatever that means,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “I kind of like that spot, to be honest with you.”
Perhaps one reason for Walsh’s dismissal of the Ivy preseason rankings is his confidence in Harvard’s strong group of underclassmen, many of whom are stepping up to fill the 12 spots left by last year’s graduating class.
One loss that will certainly be felt is that of two-time captain Tyler Albright. Although the Crimson is still working out who will fill Albright’s place at catcher, the team has tapped junior Andrew Ferreira to fill in as the dugout’s leader.
“We lost a good senior class, a lot of talent, but I feel like chemistry-wise, it’s not even close,” Harvard’s new captain said of his squad. “It’s night and day from where it was last year, so we’re excited to get going.”
“This year we all came back...and were like, ‘We’re not going to go 9-36 again,’” fellow junior Robert Wineski echoed. “We’re not going to be the doormat of the Ivy League.’”
One place where changes will be especially noticeable is in the outfield, where the Crimson will most likely be starting a sophomore and two freshmen.
Sophomore Jack Colton is expected to take on the role in left, while new recruits Brandon Kregel and Mike Martin will fill in the rest of the outfield.
“I think [Martin’s] going to be a guy who’s going to patrol the garden out there for four years in center field,” Walsh said of the rookie. “He’s also pretty good in the infield, but I think the pitching staff would shoot me if I took him out of center field.”
Though Colton, Kregel, and Martin will likely be fixtures in the outfield, others, including sophomore Jeff Hajdin and freshman Zach Boden—who spent the fall as a standout running back for the Harvard football—will see playing time as well.
But the Crimson’s depth in the outfield is matched, if not exceeded, by the depth of Harvard’s pitching staff.
Two graduated hurlers, Eric Eadington and Max Perlman, are now playing in the pros, but Harvard’s coach argues that new pitching talent will be more than enough to fill those spots.
“I think that whether we look at who’s starting, who’s coming in, [or] who’s finishing the game, our pitching staff right now…could play anybody in a five-game series,” Walsh said. “And in that fifth game, no one’s going to have the depth that we have. So we’re really, really excited about that, and I think the team recognizes it.”
Senior Brent Suter, who earned first-team All-Ivy honors his sophomore year and is currently one of 30 nominees for the Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award, is expected to be back as a big contributor after a successful summer on the mound. Suter, classmate Connor Hulse, juniors Joey Novak and Matt Doyle, and sophomore Sam Dodge make up a formidable core of starters that will no doubt be crucial to keeping the Crimson’s title hopes alive during its long season.
That core will also be augmented by Ferreira, who is coming off Tommy John surgery, sophomore Baron Davis, and rookies Tanner Anderson, Jacob Kremers, and Matt Timoney.
In the infield, several jobs remain up in the air, but opponents can count on seeing senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds, junior first baseman Danny Moskovits, and sophomore shortstop Jake McGuiggan returning to their positions from last year.
The uncertainty continues into Harvard’s offense, but the team will turn to the bats of Reynolds and fellow senior Marcus Way to produce runs—something the Crimson struggled with in last year’s campaign.
The Harvard squad still needs to answer questions surrounding certain areas of its game, but armed with a new mentality and renewed depth, the team looks to be in a better position than it was last season.
“It’s kind of neat to know that when you’re making a 22-man roster to travel, you don’t get to 18 and say, ‘Who are we going to take this week?’” Walsh said. “You’re saying after 22, ‘I can’t believe we’re not taking this guy or we’re leaving this bat or arm at home.’”
But that said, Walsh admits there’s something missing.
“We could use a few fans this year,” he deadpanned.
Maybe some underdog appeal will help.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just as The Back Page wrote last week, Jeremy Lin ’10 is quickly jumping up the list of Harvard’s most notable alumni. But, just as every media outlet reminds its audience every article, broadcast, or interview, the path hasn’t always been easy for Lin. Therefore, we at TBP had the idea to make Lin’s journey from Crimson bench player to the next NBA human-highlight reel as accessible as possible. So here it is, a Lineage of the point guard’s road from number four to number 17, resident of Harvard Yard to owner of a Trump Tower apartment.
The Jeremy LINeage Part II:
No Longer Golden
The NBA honeymoon was over for Lin barely a year after it began when Golden State announced its decision to part ways with the young point guard. Things did not look good for Lin, as the NBA lockout still loomed over a shortened season.
 Lin Gets Refueled as a Rocket
After only two days without a team, the Houston Rockets decided to pick up Lin just in time for preseason play. His contract was not guaranteed, though, and he would have to fight for his spot on a roster laden with several other point guards. Regardless, it was a signing. And, for Lin, that was a pretty good place to start.
 Crash Landing for the Newly-Ex-Rocket
On Dec. 24, less than two weeks after the Rockets picked Lin up off of waivers, the point guard found himself without a team once more. His energy and youth turned out not to be enough to earn him a spot on the team, and Lin was again on the free-agency market, searching for a place to prove himself. It was an unwelcome déjà vu all over again.
 New [York] Beginning
Two days after the start of the 2011-12 NBA season, the New York Knicks decided to give Lin a shot, and the second-year NBA vet traveled back to the coast where he played his college days all those teams ago. As Lin’s third squad in about three weeks, there was no certainty whatsoever in whether he would remain in New York or if that would just be the latest pit stop on his sign-and-release journey. Right after the news was official, Lin tweeted: “Thankful to God for the opportunity to be a New York Knick!! Time to find my winter coats from college lol”.
 
 Nightmares in the City That Never Sleeps
Adjustments are rough. Especially when they are played out in front of an NBA arena filled with approximately 20,000 people. To say that Lin struggled in his first few weeks as a Knick may be an understatement. He played like this, got sent down to the Development League, was brought back up, and then finally started playing mediocre basketball. It turns out that all this was just a warm-up for what was to come. But at the time, no one could possibly have known.
 And It Begins.
You all know this story by now. Lin checked into the game against the New Jersey Nets, unknowing that the next couple of hours would literally be career-altering, life-changing, and twitter-trending. He tallied 25 points, seven rebounds, and five assists, giving the Knicks their first win in three tries. And so, he became the apple of the Big Apple’s eye. This was the Lintroduction to the ride of thrill and success for the Harvard alum—the beginning of Linsanity.

There’s no question that Jeremy Lin ’10 has created a financial bonanza for the New York Knicks. Lin’s jersey has quickly become the hottest-selling item in the NBA, and the stock price of Madison Square Garden skyrocketed following the start of Linsanity. In fact, by February 13th, Lin was branded a fourteen million dollar man. He drew global attention to the franchise; suddenly everybody was a Knicks fan.
But in addition to his immense marketing draw, Lin has also been one of the best bargains in the NBA this season.
With a salary of just $762, 195—small change by NBA standards—Lin has averaged 14.6 points per game, currently 63rd best in the league.
Extrapolate that production over the whole strike-shortened 66-game season, and we find that Lin earns $790.99 per point scored.
When we compared that with some of the biggest names in the NBA, the difference was stark. LeBron James earns $8,860 for every point he scores. Lakers guard Kobe Bryant takes home $13,420 for each of his points, while San Antonio’s Tim Duncan and Boston’s Kevin Garnett are both paid over $20,000 per point —a figure greater than 220 J-Lin jerseys.
The Boston Celtics are next on the calendar for the Knicks and their underpaid, highly hyped point guard, who will be returning to the city where he first became a star. And although the Lin jerseys have been selling just as well in Boston, we will have to wait until Sunday afternoon to see if the notoriously devout Celtics fans have completely bought in to Linsanity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most students will take time off and head home this month for Spring Break, March will also provide a number of Crimson athletes with some of their most crucial matchups.Here's a look at some of the games that could have major implications for Harvard Athletics.
March 2nd: Men’ and Women’s College Squash Association Individual Championship
Both men’s and women’s squash will compete in this pinnacle event of individual intercollegiate squash. The men will play in Hanover while the women will be in Amherst, Mass. Watch out for freshman Amanda Sobhy who is considered to be one of the best women’s collegiate squash players of all-time, having beaten last years national women’s champion, 11-1,11-3,11-1. On the men’s side, look for Ali Farag (11-0) who was ranked the No. 1 junior player in the world last year.
March 2nd-3rd: Women’s Water Polo at the Harvard Invitational
Look forward to three of Harvard's four home games of the season; The Crimson will first play coach Ted Minnis' alma mater, San Jose State, at 7pm on the 2nd. On the 3rd, the team will face Princeton and Bucknell, at 11:40 and 7:00p.m, respectively.
March 2nd-3rd: Men's Basketball vs. Columbia and Cornell
 
After Penn’s victory against Harvard in late February, Harvard is no longer assured a ticket to the NCAA tournament. This pairing of games will determine the Crimson's fate. With two wins, Harvard will be guaranteed a share of the Ivy title; with two loses, however, Harvard will likely be out of the running for the tournament. In addition, depending on the success of other conference teams in this last weekend of the season, the Ivy title could be split in a variety of ways in the end. Overall, March 2nd and 3rd will determine the fate of the Crimson's bid to the NCAA tournament, as well as the Ivy title.
March 2nd -3rd: ECAC Women's hockey semifinals
Harvard women’s hockey (22-8-1) swept Princeton in the ECAC quarterfinals at the end of February, 5-4, 5-3. It now heads to the ECAC semifinals in Ithaca, N.Y. where it will play St. Lawrence (22-9-4). A victory in the ECAC Tournament will earn the Crimson an automatic seed in the NCAA tournament later in March.
March 6th: Women’s Lacrosse vs. James Madison
Women’s lacrosse (1-0) will play against James Madison at home at 3:30p.m on the 6th. James Madison (2-1), an historically challenging Harvard rival, is currently ranked 13th in the nation. This match should be a good indication of the Crimson's strength going into the season. It should also be a good warm-up for the rest of the month, which features matchups with ranked teams Penn, Johns Hopkins, and Boston College.
March 9th-11th: ECAC Men’s Hockey Quarterfinals
Harvard Men’s Hockey, currently 3rd in the Eastern College Athletics Conference, will start in earnest its journey to the 2012 Championships in Atlantic City. The teams will be arranged such that the best out of three games will move on to the semi-finals on Mar. 16. With Harvard’s win in late February against Clarkson (3-2) after a rough start, the Crimson secured a bye directly into the quarterfinals. Look for top players senior Alex Killorn, and juniors Danny Biega and Alex Fallstrom to bring Harvard to victory.
 
March 27th: Men’s Lacrosse vs. Massachusetts
Coming off an already great start to the season, Harvard men’s lacrosse (2-0) will take on the 8th-ranked University of Massachusetts (3-0). Although not a conference game, a win against the Minutemen would give the Crimson momentum continuing its season and its subsequent games against Michigan and Cornell.
March 30th: Women’s Softball
 
Looking towards a busy March, Harvard will play its 18th game this season against Cornell. After two years of meeting in the season-closing championship series, with the Big Red winning in 2010 and the Crimson taking the championship last year, it will be interesting to see how comparable the teams are this year. With Cornell losing record-holding pitcher Elizabeth Dalrymple to graduation last year, we will have to wait to see which team will triumph in 2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After falling just short of its first NCAA tournament appearance in six years last season, the No. 15 Harvard men’s lacrosse team went out and reloaded.
The squad lost its best player, Dean Gibbons ’11, to graduation, but is poised to replace the production of the attackman and his fellow departed seniors thanks to an elite recruiting class that Inside Lacrosse ranked No. 3 in the nation.
The group marks a monumental haul for second-year head coach Chris Wojcik ’96, who added some of the nation’s best high schoolers to his first-ever class of recruits. Its a group of rookies so talented that Inside Lacrosse deemed it “arguably the strongest Ivy recruiting class in at least a decade.”
The class includes six freshmen in the Inside Lacrosse Top 100, all of whom rank inside the top 65 and four of whom are in the top 26. Though the squad returns nine starters from a team that won 10 games last seasons—its most since 1998—many of the rookies have already left their mark on the field.
“It’s a class of great kids,” Wojcik says. “[They’re] high-character individuals, in addition to being a very talented class.”
The group is led by Stephen Jahelka, a defenseman, who, like Gibbons, hails from Garden City, N.Y. Jahelka—a 2011 first-team All-American and the 2011 Long Island Player of the Year—was ranked as the best defensive recruit in the nation by ESPN and Inside Lacrosse. The former publication ranks him as the No. 6 recruit overall, the latter as the eighth-best.
“I ask myself what I can do to make other people around me better, so people are talking about Harvard as the No. 1 defense in the nation,” Jahelka says of his objectives for the year. “I just want to step on the field, get as much playing time as I can, continue to learn, and make sure the defense as a whole is good enough to keep teams up at night.”
Two other talented rookies, Jack Breit and Brian Fischer, are helping Jahelka try to attain that goal. Breit was ranked the 46th-best overall recruit by Inside Lacrosse, while Fischer, Jahelka’s high school teammate, was ranked 21st.
To play behind those new defenders, Wojcik landed Jake Gambitsky, deemed the best goalie prospect in the nation and the tenth-best recruit overall by ESPN. Gambitsky, who was named a U.S. Lacrosse All-American and an Under Armour All-American as a senior, could challenge junior Harry Krieger for minutes in net this season.
The Crimson also landed elite talent at midfield. Headlining that group is Sean Mahon, who was ranked the 14th-best recruit overall and the fourth-best incoming midfielder by Inside Lacrosse. Also from Garden City, Mahon is a member of the U.S. Men’s Under-19 team that will compete in the World Championships in Finland this year.
Joining him as freshman midfielders will be Peter Vandervelde, Grove Stewart, and ESPN-Rise first-team All-American Kegan Michel, whom Inside Lacrosse ranked 54th overall in the nation. Michel has shown early on why he earned that distinction, racking up a team-high seven ground balls in the team’s opener against Vermont and scoring two goals on Tuesday at Holy Cross.
“They’re a great group of guys, top-to-bottom,” tri-captain Terry White says. “Talent-wise, they really have not disappointed. They’re poised to [make an] impact pretty much all over the field. They’ve handled the expectations well, and they’re going to give us an extra boost this season.”
The class is also talented up front.
First, there is Will Walker, ranked as the No. 36 overall recruit by ESPN. After scoring 88 goals during his high school career, Walker tallied his first collegiate score against the Catamounts.
He will be joined on the freshman attack by Philip Wagley and Matt Scalise, son of Harvard Athletics Director Bob Scalise. Matt will become the third member of his family to play for the Crimson lacrosse squad, joining brothers Mark, a senior midfielder, and Michael, who also played midfield for Harvard before graduating in 2010.
Of the rookies, Wojcik says, “they’ve all come in from day one and really competed to raise the level of talent on the team, but also for playing time and roles on the team,
he adds. “We have high expectations for them, and we expect them to be major contributors over the course of their four years.”
Early on in the season, the rookies are simply trying to learn as much as they can.
“It’s different coming through high school,” Jahelka explains. “As a senior, you’ve been there four years, you’re kind of more of a teacher. When you get to college, you’re back to being a student....The game’s a lot quicker; everything is a lot faster. You have to comprehend more things on the fly. I’m like a sponge trying to absorb all the tips and tricks of the trade.”
As a whole, the talented group of freshmen has the Crimson poised to finally get back to the NCAA tournament after having its bubble popped following a loss in the Ivy title game last season.
“Everyone in that locker room wants to win a national championship,” Jahelka says. “All the little things add up to that goal of playing Memorial Day weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oh God, it’s happening again.
If you’re reading this, you know what occurred last weekend. For the third time in two years, Harvard suffered a gut-wrenching one-point loss to an Ivy rival that put its ability to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1946 in jeopardy.
What had been a coronation turned into a collapse, as the Crimson blew a double-digit second-half lead at home to Penn while Zack Rosen went Super Greg Jennings and willed the Quakers to victory in the biggest game of his career.
Normally, in this section, I’d delve into a deeper recap of last weekend’s festivities, but I’d rather not think about them because quite honestly, I have fonder memories of my bris.
And besides, my colleagues, E. Benjamin Samuels and Alexander Koenig, have already written outstanding columns this week on the heart-wrenching experience of being a Harvard basketball fan over the past two seasons. The Crimson is now left to hope that “The Charge” does not become 2012's version of “The Shot.”
So let’s just jump into the picks and not think about the fact that if Harvard loses the Ivy title, the Red Sox's 2011 season will no longer be Boston’s biggest sports disaster of the year. Because, as Ricky Bobby would say, “If you’re not first, you’re last.”
HARVARD (24-4, 10-2 Ivy) AT COLUMBIA (14-14, 3-9)
Winning on the road in the Ivy League is always tough, and the Columbia-Cornell road trip is especially difficult to sweep.
But that is what Harvard must do this weekend, starting by knocking off the Lions, whom they only beat by five a month ago and who have played Penn, Princeton, and Yale within five points at Levien.
If the Crimson can contain Brian Barbour again—and Brandyn Curry, who held him to 4-of-13 shooting in the squad’s last meeting, is the team’s best chance to do so—it should, on paper, be able to win this. But the Lions are dangerous (just ask Simba’s dad), and Harvard needs to come out strong.
Pick: Harvard 66, Columbia 61
BROWN (8-21, 2-10) AT PENN (17-11, 9-2)
I need to stop forgetting how much power I have with these columns.
Two weeks ago, after singlehandedly inspiring Dartmouth to a win over Brown, I probably should not have challenged Zack Rosen to have a Michael Jordan-esque weekend with his collegiate legacy on the line.
Because that’s exactly what he did, scoring the last 16 (SIXTEEN!) Penn points against Dartmouth Friday, then the last nine against the Crimson Saturday. It’s only fair if I take full credit for those events, so...my bad. Like Ron Burgandy in the bear cave, I immediately regretted that decision.
Brown, meanwhile, staved off what would have been an embarrassing last-place tie with the Big Green with a Saturday win over Columbia. After scoring 100 in the season’s penultimate Saturday last season, Brown strangely went off again in the third-to-last game of this year, dropping 94 on the Lions.
Brown shot a ridiculous 14-of-22 from three, motivated by the advice that’s been given to every runner towards the end of the pack, every student before a test he or she didn’t study for, and every American World Cup team for the past half-century: “No matter how bad this turns out, whatever you do, just don’t let yourself be as bad as Dartmouth.”
Pick: Penn 74, Brown 57
YALE (19-7, 9-3) AT PRINCETON (16-11, 7-4)
The Ivy League may be as deep as it’s ever been, with four squads in the Top 100 of the RPI, including these two.
Both have something to play for in this one and can keep their tournament dreams alive—provided Harvard loses this weekend—by winning out.
If there’s one team with the size to stop Greg Mangano and the Bulldogs, it’s Princeton, which has won five of its last six and—after topping the Crimson in Jadwin—played Harvard to the wire in Episode II: Attack of the Clones Friday night.
Behind its home crowd, I think the Tigers take this in a tight one.
Pick: Princeton 61, Yale 60
DARTMOUTH (5-23, 1-11) AT CORNELL (11-15, 6-6)
Last weekend, the Big Green had the chance to stun Penn at home, nearly tying the game with 12 seconds to go on a Jvonte Brooks and-one layup. But Brooks missed the ensuing free throw, Rosen hit two from the charity stripe (they call it that for a reason, Jvonte!), and that was that. Classic Dartmouth.
The only thing remotely interesting about this game is that if the Big Green’s Gabas Maldunas (9.0 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG) goes off, he could possibly overtake Cornell’s Shonn Miller (9.3 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.8 BPG) for the league’s Rookie of the Year.
If basketball doesn’t work out for those two, I suggest they team up and star in a buddy cop movie called “Gabotage.” They’d be the best Lithuanian-Ohioan BFF combo since Big Z and LeBron.
Pick: Cornell 68, Dartmouth 57
HARVARD AT CORNELL
Would there be anything—and I mean ANYTHING—in the world that would make the Cornell Basketball Blog happier than the Big Red ending the Crimson season by winning this one? Save for the Knicks signing Jeff Foote and then trading Jeremy Lin to Morgan Stanley for Ryan Wittman, I don’t think so.
This game will be tough; traveling to Ithaca for Saturday contests always is. Add in the fact that it’s the Senior Night of Chris Wroblewski and Andrew Ferry (who, after going to the Sweet 16 as sophomores, won’t want to end their careers with a loss), the fact that the game is on ESPN3 (Harvard is 2-7 over the past two years on ESPN affiliates), and the fact that the Big Red has topped Yale and Princeton at home, and I am sufficiently terrified.
Because quite honestly, the Crimson looks lost offensively right now. This just doesn’t feel like the same Harvard squad which you knew last season would reliably hit its threes at home and which would come back against an inferior team no matter how much it was down by. And it isn't.
The defense has kept the ship afloat all year, but—despite the fact that it brought everyone back from 2011’s team and added to them a talented group of freshmen—the offense has struggled to find any sort of flow all season long. Last year, the Crimson scored at least 68 points in 11 of its 14 Ivy games. In 2012, it has hit that mark just three times, with a high of just 71.
Nobody has emerged that the team can rely on to score in a tight game down the stretch. That could not have been more evident this weekend, when Rosen took over for the Quakers while the Crimson was left with last year’s Player of the Year—Keith Wright—sitting on the bench and a freshman, Corbin Miller, taking the biggest shot of the season.
It has gotten to the point where, during the timeout before Casey’s charge Saturday, I turned to my co-beat writer, Martin Kessler, and asked what he would call. Neither of us had an answer. Instead, we both had a sinking feeling that “Oh crap, now they have to score.”
If the Crimson is going to win this weekend, somebody needs to step up and knock down shots. If Laurent Rivard, Oliver McNally, and Corbin Miller combine to go 2-for-9 again from deep and Wright doesn’t reestablish himself as a dominant force inside, Harvard could be in trouble.
But this is a veteran squad fully aware of the magnanimity of the situation, and I imagine it will find a way to win. A loss here would be a bigger stomach-punch than that thrown by Nicholas Cage during his future guest appearance on “Gabotage.”
Pick: Harvard 65, Cornell 59
DARTMOUTH AT COLUMBIA
No one cares, moving on.
Pick: Columbia 59, Dartmouth 53
BROWN AT PRINCETON
I’ve made fun of Brown a lot this year, and deservedly so—the Bears have been awful.
That being said, Brown is going to be a major threat to win the league next year. Seriously. With Harvard losing Wright (not to mention Miller and McNally), Yale losing Mangano, Princeton losing Doug Davis, and Penn losing Rosen and Bernardini, things should open up a bit next season.
And the Bears, who have just one senior, will return all five starters and add All-Ivy forward Tucker Halperin—who missed this entire season due to mono—and top recruit Rafael Maia, who was ineligible this year.
In fact, with Maia, Andrew McCarthy, Halperin, Sean McGonagill, and Stephen Albrecht, it will, on paper, have the best starting five in the conference.
But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Because Brown’s current bridge remains in worse shape than the one over the River Kwai.
Pick: Princeton 71, Brown 60
YALE AT PENN
The Palestra should be rocking like it is 1979 tomorrow night. And I know it seems paradoxical to take the Bulldogs after picking them to lose to Princeton because it means Yale will have nothing (besides an outside chance of an NIT berth) to play for tomorrow night.
But that’s exactly what I’m doing because Yale is the better team. And the old saying is true. Size matters. The Bulldogs are a bad matchup for the Quakers, who might be the smallest squad in the league.
Then there’s the fact that Mangano will certainly have something to play for in this one. If he outplays Rosen, it could give him a leg up on what should be a very close race between those two for Ivy Player of the Year—an award we learned last season Greg really, really wants to win. So don’t expect any brotherly love in Philly from him. And while Penn doesn’t really have anyone who can defend Mangano (who had 23 and 10 in their last meeting), Yale has Reggie Willhite, one of the best defenders in the league, to throw on Rosen.
Finally, there’s the fact that Penn is just not that good—if it wasn’t for Rosen’s heroics, it would have lost to both Columbia and Dartmouth in two of its past three games. The Quakers are really a one-man show—and like that of Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol, one that needs to come to an end, eventually.
Pick: Yale 67, Penn 65
PENN AT PRINCETON
If all of the above happens, this one—played on Tuesday thanks to Princeton’s weird finals schedule—won’t matter, and Harvard will be dancing for the first time in 66 years. But both these squads would be playing for possible postseason births in the CBI or CIT, and any game between these two is always a good one.
Zack will get to play what could be the last game of his collegiate career in his home state of New Jersey, the land where only three things are impermissible: gay marriage, wearing Abercrombie & Fitch on your reality TV shows, and supermarket recruiting.
For Princeton, Ian Hummer has had a great season and should join Rosen on the All-Ivy First Team, along with, in my opinion, Mangano, Barbour, and Wright.
If Penn loses one this weekend, I would expect the Tigers to be able to top what would certainly be a deflated Quaker team at Jadwin.
Pick: Princeton 64, Penn 62
LAST WEEK: 6-2
SEASON: 33-5

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its commanding 8-1 victory over Yale last weekend at the College Squash Association Team National Championships, the Harvard women’s squash team will send its top seven players to Amherst, Mass., for the CSA Individual Championships this weekend, as the top 32 collegiate players compete for the Ramsay Cup.
The Crimson is looking for its second individual national title in three years. In 2010, during her freshman campaign, junior Laura Gemmell completed an undefeated rookie season by taking home the individual title. The next season, in the final against Bulldog sophomore Millie Tomlinson, Gemmell suffered a surprising 3-0 defeat for her first collegiate loss.
This year’s championship is expected to have fewer unanticipated results, as Harvard freshman Amanda Sobhy enters as a heavy favorite.
Indeed, “heavy” may be an understatement, as the 2010 Junior World Champion has yet to drop a game in her collegiate career. During her streak, Sobhy has dominated every opponent’s No. 1 player, including 5 of the top 10 players in the country.
Her most impressive victory came last weekend at the Murr Center, when Sobhy handed reigning champion Tomlinson an 11-1, 11-3, 11-1 defeat. It was her second defeat of Tomlinson this season, as the freshman also recorded a 3-0 victory to help Harvard take the Ivy League Championship on Feb. 12.
The CSA Individual Championships provide a much different format than the regular season, and many of the Crimson players are relishing the chance to play for themselves while still maintaining the support of their Harvard teammates.
“It’s an exciting way to see all the work we have been putting in on the court in a different environment,” junior Natasha Kingshott said. “It’s more similar to the junior squash environment, where most of us grew up playing. So there are a little bit of nerves, but also excitement to play opponents I have not played before.”
The Crimson dominates the rankings going into the weekend, with three players currently in the country’s top 10. Sobhy enters as the No. 1 seed, with Gemmell behind her at No. 3, sandwiching Tomlinson at No. 2. Trinity’s Catalina Pelaez, just one of the All-Americans to fall to Sobhy earlier this year, enters as the fourth seed.
Harvard co-captain Nirasha Guruge hopes to finish her final season on a high-note; the senior will arrive in Amherst as the No. 10 seed. At the No. 3 spot for most of the season with the Crimson, Guruge registered a 14-1 record. Guruge’s first matchup is against Cornell’s Jesse Pacheco, whom she bested, 3-0, on Feb. 5.
The Crimson’s No. 4, Haley Mendez, will join Sobhy as the squad’s only other freshman representative. Mendez enjoyed an impressive 16-1 rookie season, leading the team in wins, including her match-clinching performances against both Yale and Princeton to preserve Harvard’s unblemished record. The freshman will take on Big Red No. 2 Jesse Laird in the first round of play.
“[Our freshmen] are incredible players. I think Haley will turn a lot of heads this weekend,” Crimson co-captain Cece Cortes said. “She plays a great game and has a great head on her shoulders.”
Cortes will enter her last collegiate tournament pitted against Bantam No. 2 Alicia Rodriguez. Cortes clinched the Howe Cup last weekend by winning the fifth match at the No. 5 position and finished the season ranked 21st.
No. 6 Kingshott faces a stiff challenge from Penn No. 1 Nabilla Ariffin. Ariffin, the Quaker’s junior captain, finished 2011 ranked 12th in the country. Kingshott, currently ranked 23rd, finished the season with a 12-2 record, including three 3-0 victories during the CSA Team Championships. The junior looks to carry her momentum into Amherst this weekend.
No. 7 Sarah Mumanachit, the only Harvard player other than Sobhy to maintain an undefeated record throughout the season, will test her perfect year against Yale sophomore Kim Hay. Hay gave the Crimson something of a shock in the Ancient Eight title decider, handing Gemmell her second collegiate loss in a 3-2 thriller. Gemmell avenged that loss last weekend, defeating Hay in three games, but Hay has shown the potential to beat the best.
With Harvard providing so many representatives, the weekend promises to be a valuable one for the team, especially if Sobhy can snag the crown.
“I think she’s definitely the favorite,” Kingshott said. “But she respects every single one of her opponents, and [Tomlinson] in particular…. There’s definitely a target on Amanda’s back, but she’s been in situations like this before and handled herself so gracefully. She takes pressure well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Friday, the Harvard men's basketball team will seek redemption as it travels to the Big Apple to take on Columbia. We caught up with the Columbia Daily Spectator's Michele Cleary and Zach Glubiak to get the inside scoop on Lions basketball.
What can Harvard expect from Columbia on Friday?
ZG: To be honest, I would expect the Lions to come out full of energy this Friday. Head coach Kyle Smith and several of his players called the loss to Brown last Saturday their worst performance of the season, and with all of the hype surrounding Friday's game, Levien Gymnasium should be buzzing with excitement. On the court, it's really a matter of whether the Lions can get back to their bread and butter—tough defense and an opportunistic offense. I think a lot will hinge around the play of center Mark Cisco. If he can get going and avoid foul trouble, Columbia is a far more dynamic team.
 
When Noruwa Agho went down, I think everyone expected Columbia to have a Dartmouth-esque season. How do you explain the success?
MC: That was one of the most horrifying moments of my life, but it was ultimately not so terrible for the team. For one thing, I think people underestimated how good Brian Barbour was, but he has put the team on his back many times this year in ways Noruwa used to. Mark Cisco deserves a lot of the credit, too. He's obviously a monster on the boards and his outside shot has gotten really solid.
Can you please explain to me what the deal is with Blaise Staab’s and Mark Cisco’s hair?
MC: Honestly, I can't. I've never gotten up the courage to ask either one of them. The headband has become a superstition thing for Cisco, I think. As for Blaise, when we were at Princeton a few weeks ago, one of the little kids sitting behind press row yelled, "Hey #30! This is men's basketball!"
What happened on Saturday? Did both teams agree to stop playing defense in the second half?
MC: More like Columbia decided not to play defense for the first 10 minutes or so. Once the Bears got going, nothing could stop them. I'm pretty sure if one of Columbia's players had tackled McGonagill to the ground while he was shooting, his shots still would have gone in.
What are the keys to slowing down Brian Barbour?
ZG: Make him work to get the ball. He has had trouble when teams make him work to even get his hands on the ball, with man-to-man full-court sets, doubles, and other ways of denying him the ball employed by most Ivy League teams. He is the key to the whole offense, so if someone else is bringing the ball up the court, not only does that limit Barbour's effectiveness but it hurts the entire team's offense.
Where’s the best spot near campus to grab some food post-game?
ZG: It's New York, so you can find pretty much whatever you want, but my personal favorite is the Heights. Start with your standard-but-delicious guacamole and chips and order the grilled steak burrito and you'll be set. If you're looking to start the night off, order a strawberry margarita on the side.
Final score prediction?
MC, ZG: 61-58 Columbia with a winning three by senior Steve Egee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW  YORK, N.Y.—Junior Kyle Casey had 19 points and co-captain Keith Wright added 16 points and eight rebounds, helping Harvard escape a sold-out Levien Gymnasium with a 77-70 overtime victory over Columbia Friday evening.
“I think our league is sensational, and I think this is another example of that,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “What an effort by our team, to find a way [to win].”
The victory helped the first-place Crimson (25-4, 11-2 Ivy) stay a half-game ahead of Penn, which took down Brown, 54-43.
Led by guard Brian Barbour’s game-high 23 points and five assists, the Lions (14-15, 3-10) again nearly pulled off an upset in front of a crowd of 2,702 that included New York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin ’10 and Spike Lee on Friday.
After trailing by six points with 4:16 remaining, Columbia tied the game at 62 on a Barbour finger-roll layup with 33 seconds left.
“He’s so crafty and slithery and makes plays,” Amaker said. “We have a number of guards in our league that are very difficult to handle off the dribble, especially that way we play in terms of wanting to play man-to-man. It’s challenging, it’s difficult, and we did the best we could.”
Harvard held the ball for the final shot of regulation, but co-captain Oliver McNally missed a three-pointer from the right wing to send the game to an extra period.
“We had the last shot, we had a great shot by our senior—a wide-open three—and I’ll take that every day of the week and twice on Sunday,” Amaker said.
“[We were] playing with fire—they had McNally, [sophomore wing Laurent] Rivard, and [freshman Corbin] Miller out there,” said Columbia coach Kyle Smith of his decision to implement a zone defense on the play. “I was like, ‘You know what, we haven’t been able to guard them in man, so what the heck.’”
Casey opened overtime with a short jumper, and both squads went scoreless for the next two and a half minutes until Rivard sank a left-wing three to make it 67-62 with 1:55 left.
The Lions responded with a jumper from the right side by center Mark Cisco, who was the team’s second-leading scorer with 12 points and five rebounds.
But Casey drained another three from the right wing on a kick-out pass from junior guard Brandyn Curry, extending the Harvard lead to 70-64.
Following a Barbour free throw, Columbia then missed its next three field goals, and McNally went seven of eight from the free throw line to seal the Crimson’s program-record 25th victory of the season.
Its latest win appeared to be in jeopardy for much of the second half, during which Barbour had 14 points.
A baseline jumper by Cisco capped a 7-0 run that gave the Lions a 41-40 lead with 15:27 remaining.
The hosts led by three a minute later, before a pair of slam dunks by Wright and Casey pushed the Crimson back ahead by one.
The lead switched for the fifth and sixth times of the half when Barbour and McNally traded baskets, but at 10:50 a Casey three off a pass from freshman reserve Wesley Saunders made it 51-47 Harvard, which then held onto the advantage until the final basket of regulation.
Harvard quickly jumped out to an 18-8 lead eight minutes into the evening and took a 21-14 advantage on a three-pointer by McNally, but an 8-0 run capped by Barbour’s layup then gave the home squad its first lead since the opening minute.
Saunders pitched in five of his seven points in the final 3:20 of the half to send the Crimson into intermission with a 34-30 lead after shooting 75 percent from the field in the period.
“To their credit, all we worked on all week was defense,” Smith said. “I look at halftime and they shot 75 percent—that’s hard to do...I was so excited, I was like, ‘We’re only down four.’”
The Lions managed to keep the game within reach thanks to 10 first-half points by freshman Alex Rosenberg and 14 points off of Harvard’s seven turnovers.

How much are you willing to pay to get Jeremy Lin's boxers? An enterprising eBay vendor estimated $1,000 to be a decent opening bid for a pair of boxer briefs he claims Lin wore during his time at Harvard. Unfortunately for the Linsane, this listing was quickly taken down. There is, however, a used Harvard Under Armour tank top for sale! No connection to Lin was disclosed, except for the obvious Harvard link.
In the case that used clothing with dubious and tenuous links to JLin are not your cup of tea, we scoured the Internet to find some other Harvard-related gems for sale:
1. Linsanity Magic Wands 
You've always wanted to go to Hogwarts and bragged to your friends back home that Annenberg is just like the Great Hall. Now you can take the Hogwarts analogy and Linsanity to another level with these specially made Linsane Magic Wands. Unfortunately, they only come with one spell each, so you can wave it at your laptop 'til spring break, but the keyboard won't write that paper for you à la Rita Skeeter.
2. Swarovski Crystal Harvard Baseball Hat 
Stay classy, brah.
3. Kermit-at-Harvard T-shirt
Juniors: out of time to clean your room before your parents inspect visit? Order this shirt about the implications of disorganization on intelligence: no one can argue with the Muppets or anything stamped "Harvard."
4. Harvard Chamber Pot
The marvelous Internet also provides a solution to those of us unfortunate enough to live in walkthroughs (with spectacular river views!). The next time your roommate interrupts your sexy-time on their way to the bathroom, gift them this vintage Harvard chamber pot. This great addition to your room will alleviate both awkwardness, but should come with a discussion of cleaning practices.

Feb. 27, 1904: College Library Broken Into
On Thursday night the College Library was broken into. All but one of the busts in the Reading Room were defaced with brown paint, some of the chairs were daubed with white paint, and the Superintendent's chair and lamp and the face of the clock also received a coat of paint. Broken eggs were left on the Superintendent's desk, and paint was spilled liberally about the floor. On one of the tables and on the window the words "Med. Fac." were scrawled in paint. Most of the damage was repaired before the Library opened in the morning.
Feb. 28, 1942: Houghton Library, First New Yard Edifice in Last Ten Years, Will Be Dedicated Tonight
Dedication of the Houghton Library for the housing of Harvard's rare books is scheduled for tonight and tomorrow, climaxing 17 months of building and recurrent delays in opening.
The only addition to the Yard in the last decade, the new library fulfills the University's need for a suitable location for its treasure items. The six-story Georgian building in the east corner of the Yard has been widely acclaimed as the nearest perfect existing structure for its purpose, even surpassing the National Archives in Washington.
Originally scheduled for completion last July, the Library was delayed by defense and war priority rulings and the opening ceremonies planned for January 10 had to be postponed. The building is now finally completed and half the 260,000 volumes which will ultimately be shelved in it have been placed in the stacks.
Tonight's ceremonies will highlight the two-day dedication procedure with addresses to an invited audience of 300 by President Conant and donor Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. '29 in the new reading room. Earlier a small dinner will be held at the President's house and tomorrow from 2:30 to 6 o'clock a reception will be held for members of the Faculty, friends of the Library, and their wives. Roy E. Larsen '21, president of Time, and Sir Ronald Campbell, British Minister to the United States, will attend.
Feb. 27, 1948: Band Seeks Funds for Trips
"For services rendered," Band officers yesterday asked the University to finance all future football trips.
The request was the "definite proposal" Associate Dean Watson requested early this month when the group indicated its need for money. If accepted, it will be the first time the University has ever given money to a student organization.
Train fare to away football games is the only kind of aid the Band is seeking. Manager Joseph J. Borgatti Jr. '45 has asked that these allocations be made an annual item on the University budget.
Ebbing alumni aid has forced the Band to other sources for its finances. Unless the musicians get money from the University, the Cornell and Army trips may be omitted next year, Borgatti said. The Athletic Association will probably pay for the Princeton trek
March 2, 1971: Proposed Deferment Halt May Jeopardize Freshmen
If the current Administration-backed Selective Service bill is passed this spring—and Washington sources have indicated the chances are quite good—large numbers of college underclassmen will suddenly be exposed to the draft.
The bill presently before the House Armed Services Committee (Senate Committee hearings ended yesterday), recommends the abolition of virtually all student deferments as President Nixon urged last April 23. If it becomes law, Nixon will be free to change the deferment system.
Nixon has said repeatedly that only those eligible for a II-S deferment on April 23, 1970, will continue to be eligible for the classification. Under this plan, a large majority of currently enrolled freshmen and some sophomores will lose their student deferments.
Divinity School deferments (IV-D) are also scheduled to be abolished, although students enrolled prior to January 29, 1971, will not be affected.
Last January 28, President Nixon asked Congress for a two-year extension of his power to induct men into the armed forces. (This would be the first two-year extension since General Custer's time-all previous extensions have been for four years.)
March 2, 1973: Harvard Religion: Gone Are the Halcyon Days
As a student at the Divinity School in 1965, Peter J. Gomes's first encounter with a Memorial Church service was hardly auspicious. "I knew I had arrived at Harvard," he said. "I didn't understand a word of what was going on." Now as acting minister to the University, he is in charge of this institution whose rationale has since come under close scrutiny.
Attendance at Memorial Church has dropped from the halcyon days of the fifties, when Sunday services drew crowds of 1000, triple their present attendance. Morning prayers, a tradition as old as the University, today attract 35 to 40 hardy souls—a far cry from the days when student attendance was compulsory.
But more basic to the current dilemna of Memorial Church is the anomaly of an established Protestant church (with strong Unitarian/Congregational leanings) in a community that has become increasingly otherwise. "I don't know what they believe in," Gomes said of the typical undergraduates at Harvard, "but whatever it is they don't do it here."

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
Welcome to Dunster House! Built in 1930, this house has a proud history. Known for its red bell-tower and its wide courtyard that looks over the Charles, Dunster House was one of the first two Houses constructed under former President Abbott L. Lowell's House Plan. Overall, while Dunster is certainly not the most centrally located House nor the House with the best rooming, it maintains a popular dining hall and a great deal of House pride.
House Spirit: Dunster House came in first in the poll in terms of House spirit, and comments generally stated that Dunster has a great sense of community and love for its residents. One commenter even claimed that Dunster is "the best kept secret on campus."
Dining Hall: The gem of the House is its dining hall; for at least one person, "Dunster Dhall is amazing, and by far the greatest dining space in all the land." If you've never been, the oak paneled room with long tables and portraits is well worth a visit, maybe even date-worthy. The servery, grill, and food are all above average as well. If you want proof, look no further than Dunster's first place ranking in the poll in regards to dining halls. It should be added that if you ever eat too much, there's a cozy set of couches in the back of the room to fall asleep on. The dining hall staff are very friendly as well, and one respondent even said, "I feel privileged to eat amongst the DHA-wearing sporty folks on a nightly basis. Go crimson!"
Housing Quality: Womp womp. While Dunster topped the respective polls in House spirit and dining, it came in twelfth in regards to housing. Dunster has unfortunately developed a poor reputation for its suites over the years. Small bedrooms and walkthrough rooms abound in the House for sophomores, juniors, and seniors alike. Yet, there are a few exceptions, so maybe your senior year won't involve tiptoeing past your roommate mid-hookup to use the bathroom. Maybe. Also, if all else fails, you can opt to live in DeWolfe.
Facilities: Still, Dunster's "Meese," "lovely people," and facilities may compensate for the subpar housing situation. The Dunster House library is a quaint place to study and is even a favorite among residents of other Houses. If you're spending a late night in the library and Brain Break isn't looking too appealing, Dunster residents can enjoy late-night snacks from the Grille. Located in the basement of C-Entryway, the Grille can be accessed via tunnels, so residents are able to walk around in flip-flops even during the winter.
For those inclined towards exercise, the House has a cardio room, a weight room, a room devoted to erg machines, and six squash courts (one of which has been converted into a basketball court, and another into an indoor volleyball court). If you're ever bored, there is also a kitchen, a video library, music rooms, and a pottery studio that offers classes during the semester.
Rating: In the end, Dunster, like all the Houses, is part good and part bad. Despite excellent House spirit, it looks like housing quality and distance ultimately determined this House's rating. This year, Dunster House is ranked twelfth out of 12.

For the past three years, The Crimson has ranked the Houses from one to 12 in anticipation of Housing Day. This year, Housing Day falls on March 8, and the top House will be announced on the evening of March 7, just in time for a successful River Run and last minute prayers to the River (or Quad) Gods.
As seen from past rankings, the ordering of the Houses naturally differs from year to year. While in the past the rankings have been determined by members of The Crimson, this year the decision was put into the hands of students.
A poll was distributed over House lists and remained open for five days, closing on Thursday at 5 p.m. Flyby received 969 responses, and from these responses was able to determine rankings for the Houses on four different categories: Overall, House Spirit, Housing Quality, and Dining Halls. We based the final rankings on the results of the Overall category alone.
Starting today, we will release our reviews in reverse rank order, revealing two Houses each day.
Housing Day is a staple of Harvard's undergraduate experience—and one not easily forgotten. From chaos the night prior to chaos the day of, the eve and morning of Housing Day is often recalled as 12 hours of nervousness, hyperactivity, and excitement. Regardless of your assigned House, one freshman commenter in particular got it right: "Be excited no matter what!"

As part of our Housing Market series, we'll be posting reviews and rankings for each of Harvard's 12 residential Houses over the next few days. Click here to read more about the series.
There's nothing worse than getting a bum rap, and the replies to Flyby's poll were unequivocal about Cabot House's reputation: "It's sad how people don't know how great Cabot is;" "People don't give it enough credit, and give you crap for living there when it's actually awesome;" "People hate on it too much, for no reason." Perhaps Cabotites are a bit bitter about past rankings, but they have plenty of things to say about why Cabot House is one of the best Houses on campus, if not the best.
House Spirit: With a fish for a mascot, it's easy to underestimate Cabot's House spirit. But, Cabot residents cite numerous factors for its strong sense of community, including "a ResDean so kind she must have wings," Cabot Café, a relaxed common space for both work and socializing, and a feeling of "community solidarity" reinforced by approachable and widely-liked House Masters Rakesh and Stephanie Khurana. One commenter mentions Cabot's "Non-oppressive house spirit"—a subtle dig towards more overtly-spirited Houses like neighboring Pfoho, perhaps? In the end, Cabot House is more spirited than most give it credit for: it ranked fourth in House spirit in the poll.
Housing Quality: Made up of six residence halls, Cabot House has a variety of housing options for residents: two of the halls provide a large quantity of singles with communal bathrooms, and the other halls provide mostly suites that can accommodate one to six residents at a time. Although Cabot's buildings look like traditional brick dormitories from the outside, internal renovations completed in 1993 ensured that dormitory interiors remained up to date with modern housing standards. Cabot's rooms are known for being more spacious than most other Houses: "My keys are echoing in this huge single!" one resident wrote. Another clever commenter stated, "I get lost in my room sometimes because it's too big." Finally, Cabotites are insistent on an advantage they hold dear over River House residents, writing that that Cabot's rooms "are also essentially devoid of vermin." For all of the above, Cabot ranked third in room quality in the poll.
Dining Halls: Although Cabot fares well with regards to House spirit and room quality, its dining hall received a more lukewarm response: one commenter wrote that the worst thing about Cabot is admittedly "the food, at times." Another lamented about Cabot's "lack of an 'old-harvard' feel dining hall." Still, the interior is warmly lit and rarely overcrowded, featuring large windows that provide a great view of the Quad lawn. Cabot ranked eighth in dining hall quality.
Facilities: With six separate halls, it's not surprising that Cabot has plenty to offer in way of facilities. Each residence hall has a living room furnished with comfortable couches, and four out of the six living rooms have TVs. For musicians, a piano is available in five out of the six living rooms, and two practice rooms are located in the Cabot tunnel system, which connects several of the residence halls. The Junior Common Room is quite spacious, and a movie projector is available in an adjoining room. Cabot's library is not very spacious but is open 24 hours a day and was recently renovated last spring. Although Cabot is only a stone's throw away from the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center, it also has its own gym, which includes both free weights and benches as well as cardio equipment like rowing machines, StairMasters, a stationary bike, and an elliptical trainer.
Rating: As hard as the House tries to overcome what one commenter describes as "The stigma attached to saying I live in Cabot," Cabot House still can't convince students that its distance, a ten-minute walk from the Yard, is outweighed by its strong House spirit and excellent rooms. Although there is a compelling argument to be made about its decentralized buildings, which may contribute to "disunity among houses, [and] growing but still lack of house spirit," Cabot House's reputation may ultimately be its most challenging obstacle to inter-House dominance. As one Cabotite astutely wrote, living in the House "feels like being a Lakers fan in Boston." In the end, Cabot House ranked eleventh out of 12.
Our rankings so far:
11. Cabot
12. Dunster
