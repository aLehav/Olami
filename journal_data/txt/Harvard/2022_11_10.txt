After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some say that any press is good press — but not for Harvard Business School this semester. This fall, South Korean national broadcast network JTBC reported on the distorted misrepresentation of Japan’s 1910 to 1945 colonization of Korea in HBS’s core curriculum. The distortion in question involves an HBS-published case titled “Korea,” required reading in a required class for second-semester MBA students.
The “Korea” case is sparking controversy for attributing Korea’s modernization to brutal imperial Japanese rule. It is for this reason that Korean students at Harvard Kennedy School initiated a statement demanding the case be revised by the time this class is taught next year to reflect on the realities of Japanese colonization of Korea in a more balanced manner. The statement was later signed by the wider Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Korea Society, and also covered by JTBC.
Currently, the case takes the viewpoint of the colonizer, crediting South Korea’s development to illegal Japanese occupation. It notes that “Korea became increasingly industrialized, and transportation and power infrastructure improved” during the Japanese occupation, and that the Korean “educational, administrative, and financial systems were also modernized.”
What the case fails to mention is that these very efforts to industrialize and build infrastructure in Korea were byproducts of the Japanese treatment of Korea as its military supply base in wars waged throughout Asia. The Japanese government subjected an estimated 1.2 million or more Koreans to murderous forced labor and up to an estimated 200,000 women to sexual slavery, to advance one such war in which they committed unspeakable war crimes like the Nanjing Massacre in China. It is a dangerous act of misinformation for the HBS case to laud this byproduct of industrialization without providing proper historical context as to its purpose and victims.
The HBS case’s depiction of Korea under Japanese rule stands in stark contrast to the academic handling of similar situations. In 2022, it is rare to see India and Algeria’s development credited to British or French rule, respectively, without at least acknowledgment of the harm suffered under such rule. When it comes to these other nations, historians of the 21st century seem to understand the historical context well enough to distinguish byproducts of colonial ambitions from efforts to serve the native people by means of economic development. Unfortunately, the same does not hold for Korea and Japanese rule in HBS’s curriculum.
It is true that the history of Japanese occupation in Korea has been the subject of great dispute between the two countries for decades. In sharp contrast to its wartime ally Germany, the Japanese government has made it clear over the last decades that they no longer intend to claim their war crimes against Korea. They continue to promote a narrative in front of the international community that masks their past abuses and argues for the positive impact of their colonization.
Because of this dispute surrounding the history between these two nations, HBS’s depiction of Japan and Korea’s relationship is even more disappointing. In this contentious situation, HBS has chosen to uplift only one voice — that of the Japanese colonizer — rather than treading carefully to produce a fair, balanced characterization of a difficult piece of history.
HBS’s uneven choice in the publication of the “Korea” case, in my opinion, points to deeper nefarious inclinations. As the statement argues, perhaps it is no coincidence that the group of six authors on the case includes a researcher from Harvard’s Japan Research Center visiting from a Japanese university, but no scholar from a Korean background. In addition, the statement alleges that this is not the first time HBS has faced public scrutiny for this case: Acording to its authors, numerous requests for revision from Harvard Business School students in the past have been repeatedly ignored by the school administration.
Since the statement and JTBC report, the primary author of the case, HBS Professor Forest L. Reinhardt, has said over email communications to a protesting organization that they “expect to make editorial changes to future versions of this case.”
While Reinhardt’s response is welcomed, it falls short of the concrete action and timeline Harvard GSAS Korea Society students called for in their initial statement. Moreover, we have yet to hear from HBS in any institutional capacity. It is unclear what Reinhardt’s private email correspondence, without the backing of a larger HBS body, means in practice, particularly regarding when and how the publication will be revised. As demanded by the statement, the harmful nature of the misrepresentation within the case warrants immediate action, before another MBA class of over 1,000 students engages with the publication in January of 2023.
The effort of graduate students to rectify the historical distortion within this HBS case is larger than what some may view as a mere historical dispute between two nations. It is an effort to ensure accurate historical education in one of the world’s most distinguished educational institutions, and moreover, to decolonize historical education globally. Now that the case’s primary author has recognized its malignant flaws, it is only right for HBS to communicate when, how, and by whom the “editorial changes to future versions of this case” will be made — so that no future classes of HBS students need to engage with this same deleterious, one-sided depiction of history.
Young Hyun Kim is a graduate of Harvard Kennedy School and an author of the statement demanding the revision of the “Korea” case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Saturday in January 1835, a group of African Muslims, most slaves, began an uprising in Salvador, a city in the Brazillian state of Bahia. It was called the Males uprising, likely after a Brazilian word borrowed from the term “imale,” which means  “Muslim” in Yoruba. Partly out of fear that revolutionary sentiment would ferment further, the Bahians violently punished the rebels and suppressed the activities of the Males.
Like Harvard, Brazil has a legacy of slavery that reaches back centuries. It was a main port of the slave trade, receiving almost half the slaves forcibly extracted from Africa and sent to the New World. And it was the last place in the Americas to formally abolish slavery, with many Afro-Brazilians still feeling the effects of this bloody history today. Now, due to skull records, we know that the supposed remains of at least one of the Male rebels ended up in the hands of Harvard.
This discovery comes in the aftermath of a report that found that Harvard holds the remains of 19 individuals who were enslaved and thousands of Indigenous and Native American remains. While the histories of each are long and winding, we know that the skull of the Male revolutionary ended up at Harvard through Gideon T. Snow, a U.S. citizen who lived in Brazil for some time. Snow sent the skull to Boston, where it was donated to the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. Eventually, the skull made its way into the hands of the Warren Anatomical Museum, a part of the Harvard Medical School.
Now the Islamic community of Salvador in Bahia is calling for the repatriation of the enslaved man’s remains. According to reporting by The Crimson, in September of this year, Harvard said that they would return the remains of the 19 enslaved people, but as of yet, no further steps seem to have been taken.  Advocates for the Islamic community in Salvador say that repatriation would begin to address Harvard’s violent legacy of scientific racism.
Museums are not neutral spaces. They can maintain and exhibit histories of oppression. In particular, this case highlights the global reach of anti-Blackness. The transatlantic slave trade wasn’t an isolated, unidirectional event, but one that spanned geographies to the point that the skull of a leader of a Brazilian slave revolt could end up in the hands of America’s premier university.
In recent years, calls for the decolonization of museums and the repatriation of their artifacts have increased. I struggle to believe that an institution could come to accumulate human remains, especially in such a quantity as Harvard has, through ethical means. As such, and to heal the communities from which they were taken, returning them should be a first priority.
Even in death, through the inaction of museums, these individuals remain captive, denied a proper burial. Bodies of people enslaved and exploited during life should not suffer experimentation or exhibition in death.
Harvard has released a report about their Legacy of Slavery. Now it is time to act. Returning the skull so that the Islamic community of Salvador can, at long last, provide it a proper funeral will represent a small but essential first step in the repatriation revolution needed to atone for Harvard’s harms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Names have power. The name you use to address someone defines your relationship with them. It can make the difference between an acquaintance and a friend. It can make the difference between a superior and a co-worker. A name is only a sequence of sounds that we arbitrarily use to identify an individual person, and yet names are so significant that they can cause happiness or offense, acceptance, or ostracization. That the names we use define our relationships with others is a painfully obvious idea with painfully complicated implications.
What do you call yourself?
A “relationship” refers to a connection between separate entities, so we usually use it to refer to the countless people in our lives. But the most important relationship any of us will ever have is with ourselves, or to be more precise with the definition, the relationship between who we are and how we perceive ourselves, between, roughly, our bodies and minds.
Everyone we meet will inevitably leave us — that is, everyone except ourselves. I’ve written about the transience of relationships, but the one relationship that will never end is our relationship with ourselves, and that’s what makes it so important to maintain. We are the only constant we have.
Unfortunately, I often don’t like myself very much — and even more unfortunately, I’m willing to bet that I’m not nearly alone in feeling this way, especially at a place like Harvard.
This conflict between who I am as a person and how I perceive myself manifests in many ways, but I notice it most often in relation to my physical appearance. I hate looking into the mirror; a generous helping of internalized ableism with a side of gender dysphoria will do that. Likewise, I feel repelled looking at photos of myself, and whenever I pull up group photos that include me, I mentally Photoshop myself out. I do whatever I can to run away from my appearance and myself more generally, scared to face and confront who I really am. A censored self-image remains frozen and unchanging in my mind, and I find it hard to let go.
For my birthday this year, my friend drew a picture of me with text reading “happy birthday” in Japanese. In the drawing, I appeared happy, and it struck me: for the first time I could remember, I liked looking at myself. They drew my walker and the scar where my tracheostomy used to be, and I still felt proud looking at myself. Granted, the cartoonish style hid my unusual facial features, but all the same, it was me. I texted my friend, “I wonder if that me in the drawing is really how I am in real life.”
They replied, “It is :) But IRL is better.”
Their art supported me in my insecure relationship with myself, providing a perspective that I’d previously blinded myself to and showing me my smile which I’d run away from. But ultimately, the only ones who can fix our own relationships with ourselves are ourselves. External validation amounts to nothing if we can’t first support ourselves, acknowledge our fears, and accept ourselves as we are; no matter the help, no one can fill a vessel with no bottom.
And currently, my vessel has no bottom. It’s cracked and broken; attempts to accept and appreciate myself as I change fall through. Yet the fact that my vessel is broken is itself a reason to appreciate it, because those cracks have made me who I am now.
The Japanese restoration technique kintsugi, in which metal and lacquer are used to repair broken ceramics, symbolizes a philosophy that emphasizes change as part of the whole. By visibly highlighting cracks on a ceramic item with gold, kintsugi challenges the idea that recovery means erasing hardships, and instead openly celebrates change. I feel like that’s how I want my relationship with myself to be, someday.
I want to learn to stop fighting to preserve who I used to be. When I transitioned from high school to college, I refused to let my identity move on for a long time, because high school was what I knew and I didn’t want my old self to disappear. But it never truly disappeared, and by letting myself go, I found myself again.
I want to learn to accept my harmful relationship with myself while acknowledging that I’m working to improve it. Denying how my problems contribute to who I am only prevents me from solving them. And I want to learn to move on from my imagined reality where I never change, where I face no obstacles.
Unfortunately, I don’t yet know how to do any of that. What I do know is that names define relationships, and when we call ourselves “stupid” or “ugly” or “useless,” those self-insults reinforce themselves. But if I call myself Ben — the sequence of sounds arbitrarily used to represent my existence — then that’s who I am. It hurts, because that existence contains much that I wish I could change, but those difficulties are who I am, too. And by perceiving myself as I am, all the cracks from challenges and growing that have made me who I am today, I can live for the present.
I mentioned that the “happy birthday” on the drawing was written in Japanese, but actually, because one kanji was missing, it read “happy birth.” Yet, that seems more fitting: “Happy birth — you’ve come so far. You’ve changed so much to get here, and even though you hoped the nights were eternal so that the days wouldn’t pass, even though the cracks hurt, the fact that you’ve become who you are is a miracle.”
And so dawn comes, and the days pass. And in their light, I want to choose to look ahead and to see my own smile on my own face. It’s a smile that says, “Through the good and the bad, I’ll always be there for myself, whoever I was, am, and will be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As college campuses have lost their masks and regained their students, a more insidious mark of the pandemic remains. Waves of high school graduates who lost essential high school years to Zoom are arriving on campus.
Let’s be clear: Learning loss from Covid-19 is a national catastrophe whose effects will be with us for decades. Math and reading scores for fourth graders have dropped by record amounts, reversing two decades of progress. Gaps in education compound over time; unprepared fourth graders become worse-prepared high schoolers who are less likely to go to college, or even to graduate at all.
These effects weren’t felt equally. Minority and low-income students, already at a structural disadvantage, showed the worst signs of educational loss, potentially depressing lifetime earnings by tens of thousands of dollars and contributing to greater levels of economic and racial inequality.
We’re already seeing the results of these learning gaps in higher education. College enrollment has dropped sharply, as have completion rates. Community colleges in particular have struggled to maintain enrollment.
Though Harvard will feel the learning loss crisis less acutely, our university shouldn’t let its guard down. Harvard should provide proactive support for incoming students who may have effectively lost a portion of their high school education.
To start, the University could expand its free peer tutoring program to contend with what will likely be increased demand. We reiterate our calls to improve Harvard’s academic advising with newfound urgency. We ask the University to show flexibility in dealing with a problem of uncertain size and scope. And with more of our peers coming to campus less sure of their ability to succeed in a new environment, we once again ask for greater ease of access to mental health services.
Of course, Harvard’s neighbors will suffer far more from this crisis. We can use our vast resources to help soften that blow. Fully funding the PILOT program (a hypothetical first for our university) through which Harvard subsidizes city programs to make up for its substantial tax-exempt holdings would be a good start. Harvard has already shown a laudable commitment to community education with its Allston Ed Portal, connecting local students to Harvard mentors. Building on this model, Harvard can continue to provide needed educational resources to its community.
And yet, for all its vast resources, Harvard can only marginally alleviate the crisis of learning loss through direct assistance. The problem is national in scope, and most of its victims won’t even be in Cambridge, let alone at Harvard.
Systematic solutions will have to bolster the public schools that enroll roughly 90 percent of American students. We need large-scale investment in improving educational quality and equality across the country; Harvard and other elite schools should leverage their institutional power to lobby for these policy changes.
Harvard was a leader in combating the pandemic proper. Now, we must lead in healing the scars it's left behind. Harvard can help save a generation from learning loss, and it has a duty to try.

The Science, Technology, and Society 20th Anniversary Conference, held from Nov. 3 to Nov. 5, was supposed to start promptly at 5 p.m. in Paine Hall, so I rushed there — but I shouldn’t have worried. As I take my seat, organizers are trying to figure out how to start streaming the conference, since the conference is hybrid to accommodate panelists and audiences dialing in from places like Australia and Japan. (“Now this is STS,” someone near me remarks about the delay.)
STS broadly consists of two spheres of inquiry: how scientific knowledge is created and the impacts of scientific and technological advancement on society. The conference, themed “Science, Technology & the Human Future,” features a set of performances, panels, and open discussions on current scientific progress and the future of STS.
The program boasts an impressive and eclectic lineup, including Arundhati Roy, an Indian novelist and activist; David W. Oxtoby, the president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; George M. Church, the Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and a developer of methods used for the first genome sequencing; and Marc Aidinoff, chief of staff for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.
In her keynote speech, professor of Science and Technology Studies Sheila S. Jasanoff emphasizes that Harvard STS’s 20 years of existence is a long time, since STS traces itself back to only the mid-1970s. When STS first came to be, she says, it was “somewhat revolutionary” to study science and technology not only as themselves but also as social institutions. In the decades since, the line of inquiry has spread to universities across the globe.
“Interpretive frameworks for who we are, who we want to be as individuals, as collectives, as nations, as any other groups — all of this is informed by the work of science and technology,” Jasanoff says.
After Jasanoff’s speech, a piano quintet performs, contributors read from the Future Humans Anthology, and Roy discusses the possible pitfalls of scientific progress.
The second day hones in on the research areas where inquiry is flourishing. In Future of Life, for instance, speakers reflect on recent progress in organ transplantation and stem cell research and look ahead to what we may expect in the coming years.
The final day attempts to sketch out visions for the future of the field, particularly in regards to community-building. One barrier is that STS spans a large number of disciplines. “The notion of ‘home’ is difficult to STS, because it has to stay abreast of all these different fields,” says University of Vienna professor Ulrike Felt.
In panels, speakers talk about how society is too fragmented across academic disciplines, urging STS to bridge those boundaries. Multiple people point to the poor communication about quarantine policies and delayed vaccine distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic as a systemic failure resulting from the separation of science and policy.
Sociologist Brice Laurent remarks on how the Social Science, Economics, and Society Department at ANSES, a French public agency, which he now directs, originally insulated science from politics so the two could develop separately. “We need to reframe that position in such a way that this position is stable enough for the agency to work, to reconnect science and society in new terms,” he says in the Future of Policy panel.
Panelists also express different ideas about how the field of STS should progress. Some float program-level suggestions like acquiring funding, hiring more STS faculty, or instituting a department for STS. Others bring up ideological directions like being lifelong learners, listening to the demands of the public, or instituting international governance.
Developing STS at the university level is logistically challenging. Michael P. Evans ’24, an undergraduate STS fellow, mentions that at Harvard, STS is a bit of a “black sheep.” “It’s something that the administration doesn’t necessarily support in ways that we support other programs that are STEM fields,” he says. Laura Flynn, one of the main organizers, adds that she constantly has to keep an eye on the budget and was unable to reimburse travel expenses for some panelists.
Many panelists hope that eventually other societal institutions beyond universities, like think tanks and the government, will also contribute to STS. Arizona State University professor Craig J. Calhoun cautions against putting the onus for developing STS on the university. “When we say ‘the university,’ we are at danger of making an account that exaggerates the autonomy of the university,” he says, citing how different universities have varying missions, structures, and circumstances. However, in practice, most of the suggestions for developing STS involve universities. Most panelists are also professors or affiliated with the academy in some way.
So, what does the future of STS entail? Everyone seems to have a different answer. Most people agree, though, that the key to STS’s success is creating opportunities for collaboration between scientists, technologists, and policymakers.
“STS is a unique space that really demonstrates the benefits of having a wide range of conversations,” Spencer T. Doyle, an STS fellow, says. “I’m a physics Ph.D. student, and I get to hear from fiction and nonfiction authors here, from policy experts.”
Furthermore, the oft-overlooked nature of STS makes developing the field all the more important. As Pariroo Rattan, another STS Fellow and a Kennedy School student, says: “People don’t really think about science and technology from a political and social perspective. As living citizens of the 21st century, understanding the politics of science and technology should be a fundamental obligation and responsibility.”

My city is home to many languages. It houses several mother tongues. With the largest number of foreign-born residents of any city in the world, London’s streets are filled with a fusion of languages, dialects, and accents. East London barbershops hum with Nigerian Yoruba chatter, while West London coffee shops buzz with Arabic slang.
London has been shaped by immigration. After the Second World War, the United Kingdom called on its former colonies to help rebuild the nation and reverse its labor shortages. The Windrush Generation — 300,000 West Indians — traveled to the UK post World War II on the Empire Windrush boat. Over 400,000 immigrants from former British colonies were to follow over the next few decades, hailing from India, Pakistan, and several African countries. Alongside this, political changes in Eastern and Central Europe led hundreds of thousands to flee from these countries and seek refuge in Britain.
Of this generation of immigrants and refugees, the majority settled in London. As they helped to rebuild the National Health Service, the transportation systems, and the city’s physical infrastructure, they brought with them the richness of their cultures and languages. As these groups integrated and had children, they enriched the city’s landscape through their cultural food shops, pubs and bars, and especially their languages and dialects.
Growing up, my schools were filled with first- and second-generation immigrant children. As we chattered in classrooms and ran around playgrounds, our jokes and laughter were not the only things we traded. Our accents and dialects intertwined and mingled on school grounds, and gave birth to a new dialect: Multicultural London English.
Multicultural London English is a British sociolect spoken mainly by young, working class people in London. It was born out of the post World War II immigration boom, and has West Indian, African, and Arabic influences. From its roots in London, the dialect has spread to other multicultural, urban parts of the UK.
In London, it is standard for young people from all backgrounds to greet their friends in Jamaican Patois — “Wagwan” — and shout “Wallahi,” an Arabic phrase, when feigning sincerity. It is a bonding and unifying sociolect, which detaches us from “the system,” acting as a language of protection and solidarity. We are the children of a colorful city, with a rich and bridging language to show for it.
However, when I turned 16, I received a scholarship to a private school, which dragged me away from this open and warm world of language to one that was cold and coded. My slang and accent were no longer unifying agents, but instead markers that unknowingly outed me as a scholarship kid — something I held close to my chest, like a shameful secret. The language that had always been a connecting force no longer had the same strength because its audience was no longer people that looked and sounded like me.
Code switching is the practice of altering between different types of language in conversation, shifting the way one speaks in different social settings. Code switching can include changing the pronunciation of your name, using more formal language, or even changing your entire dialect to better assimilate. The connotations around code switching are often negative, with academics emphasizing its connection to the emotional and mental labor often-marginalized individuals endure to conform to the status quo.
For the first few months at this new school, I tirelessly toiled to warp my voice and my language into something that made me more palatable. I ceased slipping into Jamaican Patois; my “innits” returned to “isn’t its.” If my language was the identity I wanted to present to my new peers, I made sure it was as distant from my mother tongue as it could be.. I wanted to excel in this new setting, and I thought doing so meant leaving behind the vibrant language I’d grown up with.
But one day I had a conversation with a friend that changed my entire perspective. Coming from a Pakistani family, he bonded quickly with me over the power our multicultural background had bestowed us with. Growing up, I had switched effortlessly from Jamaican Patois to Nigerian Pidgin to Arabic. My lingo had been littered with slang from every corner of the earth, and I had jumped between these different dialects seamlessly. When I was around my Nigerian family, I was able to slip into Pidgin English and connect with them in a way British English wouldn’t lend to. Code switching in the past had helped me to better connect with people from any and every background; why should this new environment be any different?
Code switching has always been a tool of mine. In fact, it has been a super power. In spaces where I felt other than, language was a fluid and shapeshifting gift. I would always be from a different part of the city than these kids, but I could use the gift of linguistic finesse that my background had given me. Growing up, I didn’t greet my Sri Lankan friend’s parents the same way as I did my Jamaican friend’s parents. I’d been code switching all my life, and I was good at it. Despite this new school being so wildly different from my upbringing, I could still wield the linguistic skills that Multicultural London English had taught me.
I could still slip into Jamaican Patois and East London slang with my new friends. There was no need to abandon the language that felt most authentic to me. Instead, I could see this new school as a new source to pull language from, to melt into the already overflowing pool of dialects I knew well. Code switching didn’t have to be emotionally draining if I realized I already possessed all the tools I needed. Nothing about myself needed to be thrown away.
Late British sociologist Stuart Hall talked extensively about how identity is an “endless, unfinished conversation.” I could stay true to myself while also connecting with these people in a language that bridged our physical gaps because my self-conception was not fixed in stone — it was a reflection of the people I interacted with. This new environment was only another chapter in this ongoing, malleable conversation of identity, and I was well equipped to participate.

Every Wednesday at 9 a.m., a small group of students attend a seminar in the Cabot House dining hall. Its location isn’t the only thing that makes this seminar out of the ordinary — on the first day of class, rather than sharing answers to icebreakers or listening to a Powerpoint lecture, these students began the semester with a hands-on experience, embarking upon a behind-the-scenes tour of Cabot House led by its staff members.
According to the syllabus, the Quad Lab is an “experimental, practical research seminar” that helps students become “responsible citizens in [the] community” by understanding the “contested, complex, rewarding histories of the places we call ‘home.’” It explores topics including gender, race, class, ethnicity, and labor, particularly in the context of those who are left out of historical narratives. While the seminar is open to all undergraduates, the majority of students live in the Quad.
The seminar’s emphasis on house-based learning and community recalls the now-defunct House Seminars, which were for-credit courses sponsored by individual residential houses. Previous seminars included Leverett 74: “The Worldviews of Sigmund Freud and C.S. Lewis,” and Winthrop 75: “The Laws of War.”
Asked about the legacy of house seminars, Director of Undergraduate Studies in History, Quad Lab Instructor, and Cabot House Faculty Dean Ian J. Miller remarks that his class “is an experiment to see if returning classes to the house environment works.” But while the Quad Lab shares the House Seminars’ connection to a house community, it is a far cry from the old program. The Quad Lab still falls within the history department rather than operating under a house’s supervision, and, of course, focuses on the history of the Quad — there is currently no equivalent class for River houses.
The Quad, located a 15-minute walk from the heart of campus, is a unique space for examining history at Harvard. Hazim Hardeman, a Ph.D. student in American Studies at Harvard and the teaching fellow for the Quad Lab course, says the Quad has historically been a space for marginalized students on campus. “Because of how it’s positioned in relation to the University, and the tropes, the myths, the caricatures, the stereotypes that surround it, all of those things are a real fodder for historical inquiry,” Hardeman says.
Hardeman says that studying the Quad provides access to histories of race, class, and gender at Harvard. In part, this is because of the Quad’s history as the all-female Radcliffe College. After Radcliffe merged with Harvard, most Black students at the University lived in the Quad.
For Hardeman and Miller, the Quad Lab is about approaching the past differently than traditional history courses. This is why the very first day of class, when the students engage with Cabot House staff to explore the space, is so special. “By starting with those people who are oftentimes diminished in our accounts and understandings of what makes a place run,” Hardeman says, “we want to think about history in a different way.”
This different way of thinking can be utilized not only in studying the Quad but also in exploring the history of any house at Harvard, which may indicate the potential for the expansion of similar programs across campus. Miller takes Mather House as an example, suggesting that investigating “the construction of the space” would allow students to study “a 20th-century moment” that is as important as the time periods relevant to Cabot House. Miller believes houses are “the secret sauce of the Harvard College experience,” and expanding a house seminar-like program would take advantage of the diversity that is “central to that special sauce.” Hardeman adds that returning academics to the house setting “breeds a level of intimacy where people feel like the house is not only a site where they live [and] socialize, but it’s also a site of learning.”
The Quad Lab’s affiliation with the History Department navigates around some of the original drawbacks of house seminars. One feature that contributed to the decline of the seminars was their often obscure topics; as Shahram Khoshbin, the professor for Currier 127: “Disorders of the Brain and Behavior” recalls in a 1988 Crimson article: “A few years ago, apparently they had a few seminars that were rather esoteric, which gave the program a bad name.” By affiliating with the history department and narrowing its focus to each house’s past, the program may be able to avoid this pitfall if reinvigorated.
Ultimately, Miller and Hardeman are hopeful for the future of courses at Harvard such as the Quad Lab, and for the unique benefits of teaching history in residential spaces.
For Hardeman, it’s the enthusiasm of the students — many of whom are not history concentrators themselves — that makes the course so rich. “The desire to follow their curiosity, and to be concerned with how we arrive at understandings of place — that’s something that really inspires me.”

Once upon a time, in a cramped Hollis dorm room, a student stuffed a live pig into the storage bench beneath his window. Fueled by a disdain for his proctor, who lived one floor beneath him, the student would cause the pig to squeal, disturbing the proctor’s studies. But each time the proctor knocked on the door to ascertain the source of the disruption, he entered the dorm room to find nothing amiss — just an innocent student studying at the bench by his window.
When a looming faculty inspection threatened to out the student once and for all, he decided upon a fitting end to the ongoing prank: he invited a group of his friends over for a dinner party for a ravenous feast of — you guessed it — roast pig. Thus, in the year 1791, the Porcellian Club was born.
Or so the story goes. Almost 100 years passed between the alleged founding of the Porcellian and the 1887 Crimson article that reported its supposed origin tale, and approximately another 150 years have passed between then and now. What might have been lost in all those years of secrecy, rumors, and imagination that the Porcellian is famous for having inspired?
The Harvard of the 1780s was not the Harvard we know today. Classes consisted of memorizing passages in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek, according to Harvard Extension School lecturer and historian Zachary B. Nowak. There were no University-backed social clubs nor regularly-accessible libraries. And in stark contrast to today’s extracurricular environment, the College was openly antagonistic to students creating any sort of social or intellectual society; University officials were concerned that students gathering together without formal academic supervision would lead to “subversive” activity, Nowak says.
“The last thing the College wanted was a bunch of students in a room talking about college,” Nowak says. But when presented with an obstacle, college students did then what college students do now — they found a way around it.
The “Speaking Club” was founded in 1771 to remedy the “cold indifference to the practice of Oratory” that William D. Orcutt, Class of 1892, claimed the University perpetuated. The organization served as a place for members to sharpen their public speaking skills by delivering enthusiastic speeches amongst the group and bonding over their love of the spoken word. In 1873, a Crimson writer described it as being in the “foremost rank of literary societies.”. Other clubs were later founded to center their own intellectual pursuits — the Conference Francaise organized around the study of French authors, for example — but none were as large or active as the Speaking Club.
The secrecy of the Speaking Club was of utmost importance to its members — not necessarily in an effort to perpetuate prestige and exclusion, but for the practical purpose of preventing a crackdown by the administration. Fearing that the organization’s name might alert surveilling authorities of the society’s purpose, its name was changed several times throughout its first fifty years, finally settling on the “Institute of 1770” in 1825.
How did one get into the Institute? At the end of their freshman spring, 10 lucky fellows were chosen to be welcomed into the fold. Upon returning to campus in the fall, those 10 would choose another 10 new members. This next group of ten would then choose another ten members — and so on until there were about 100 to 120 members of the organization.
However, the Institute of 1770 was only the first stepping stone to entering Harvard social and intellectual life. From the first five or six “tens,” students would be pulled into other Harvard social organizations — namely, the Delta Kappa Epsilon society (known as the “Dickey”). Unlike the Institute of 1770, the DKE served no practical purpose. Rather, being part of it was a signifier of prestige that furthered one’s social standing and opened up yet more doors in Harvard’s web of increasingly elite spaces.
The men of the DKE formed a pool from which even more exclusive clubs would select their membership. These clubs include Zeta Psi (which later became the Spee), Alpha Delta Phi (which became the A.D. and the Fly), Delta Phi (which became the Delphic), and even the Hasty Pudding Club (which eventually absorbed the Institute itself in 1925). Having made it through a labyrinth of social climbing, these clubs were the last stop for a Harvard man — the top of the pyramid.
They were the final clubs.
Although administrative surveillance of students and a lack of intellectual stimulation may account for the beginnings of these first social clubs, what can account for the peculiar nature Harvard’s social scene took on soon after? What prompted this structure wherein each group was a subgroup of another, as opposed to a more democratic alternative? Once again, the answer — at least in part — can be found in the actions of the Harvard administration.
When Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, took office as Harvard’s president in 1869, he advocated for the admission of a handful of working class students into the College, according to Novak. Fearful of a socialist revolution in the U.S., Eliot hoped his admission would both suppress working class anger and encourage more formerly working class young men to uphold the mores of the elite. Hence, the socioeconomic diversity at Harvard increased under Eliot’s tenure.
A few decades prior, the American Educational Society, a Christian organization, had also worked to increase the presence of the working class at Harvard. By funding the collegiate education of low-income, Christian students from rural Massachusetts, AES hoped that these young men would return to their hometowns upon graduation to serve as educated ministers. During the approximately 30 years that it was active, AES was a significant force in getting more low-income students through the gates of Harvard in the 19th century.
Amidst this changing landscape, final clubs and their peers became a means of perpetuating the old social order, according to Nowak; clubs provided a structure through which students belonging to the highest social classes could reassert their dominance within the school’s extracurricular scene. Final clubs were a mode of separation — a tool used to reify the financial and social disparities that were now apparent across campus, both an identifier and an exacerbator, of growing disparities in the student body.
Justified or not, no club has earned this reputation as an echelon of the elite more so than the Porcellian.
The Porcellian, in at least partial contrast with the apocryphal tale of the pig and the proctor, actually began as a dinner club of young Harvard students starved for social interaction. They called themselves the Argonauts. Members rotated hosting weekly dinner parties in their respective dorm rooms. When it was Joseph McKean’s turn to host, a member of the Class of 1794, he served his friends a decadent feast, including a whole roast pig. It was so beloved by the dinner club members that they began calling themselves the “Pig Club,” which quickly became the Porcellian.
But McKean is known as the founder of the Porcellian for more than his dinner party skills. According to Orcutt’s 1892 article on the matter, McKean’s “refined characteristics” imbued the Porcellian with an aura of dignity; he solidified the Porcellian’s values as “sociability, brotherly affection, generosity, and the true spirit of a gentleman.”
With these guiding principles in mind, the Porcellian quickly came to be known as a club for some of the richest men on campus. Though perhaps founded out of genuine hopes for an association of friendly, “dignified” men at the university, the desire for more spaces reserved exclusively for only the most wealthy students underlies the Porcellian’s origin story. As the university became more egalitarian, final clubs became elite spaces within elite spaces.
Today, Harvard’s student body looks vastly different than it did at the turn of the 20th century. The school now accepts women, more students of color, and a growing number of first generation, low income students. Final clubs, too, have changed. Since 1968, when Frank M. Snowden ’68 became the first Black man to be accepted into a final club with his induction into the Spee, clubs have increased their racial diversity. Over time, numerous women’s clubs have arisen. What once began as a chance to practice oration has given way to social outings and Friday night parties.
As hundreds of students in formal dress swarm the clubs for “punch” events each fall, final clubs’ presence is clear. But with opportunities for social and intellectual stimulation now abounding outside of the clubs as well, the initial, practical needs that the clubs evolved to address have largely been accounted for.
However, the classicism and elitism that characterized these clubs’ origins still lingers today. The majority of Harvard’s student body is wealthy — coming from families whose income ranks in the top 20 percent nationally — although the growing socioeconomic diversity on campus raises questions about the role final clubs will take on going forward. Might our increasingly-diverse student body make the ever-unattainable clubs more inclusive, or will they retract even further into the exclusivity and secrecy they know so well?
Final clubs remain to be shrouded in mystery. The clubs’ official records are locked away in private archives — inaccessible without written permission from the clubs’ current presidents. We still can’t say with certainty where or how many of them originated, nor can we say where they’ll go.
Your guess is as good as ours.

On a suspiciously warm Thursday in November, the heat rises in the Leverett House Dining Hall. Tonight is round two of Hare’s Kitchen, Leverett’s new house-wide cooking competition impassioned enough to rival Chopped and wholesome enough to make “The Great British Baking Show” look cold-hearted.
We stopped in to watch a night at Hare’s Kitchen. Four teams lined up behind long oak tables each fashioned with a burner, a nesting of pots and pans, a cutting board, and a dream — cooking the best dish of the night to win a home-cooked meal by none other than interim Leverett faculty deans Daniel G. Deschler and Eileen E. Reynolds ’86.
This new house tradition comes amid turbulence in Leverett House leadership, which recently saw the sudden departure of its former deans. Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras, who served as the Leverett deans from fall semester of 2019 to this past June, were criticized for workplace hostility and discouraging house community before stepping down a year before the end of their term. Deschler and Reynolds have worked to build the Leverett spirit again with events that bring students together (or in this case, make them battle against each other).
“The new interim deans have made it their initiative here to really knit together a wonderful, brilliant, funny and light-hearted Leverett House,” says Leverett junior and the night’s commentator, Chinyere S. C. “C.J.” Obasi ’24.
The idea came out of “Lev Loves to Cook,” a pandemic tradition of holding virtual cooking classes for Leverett students. Resident Tutor Heather M. Flaherty, who works on the committee for the Leverett Student Kitchen, helped to spearhead the new in-person cooking competition, since the student kitchen could only host a limited number of students at a time.
“We wanted to come up with a more fun and engaging, full-house, event where people could be spectators, or people could be competing,” Flaherty says.
For Reynolds, a love of cooking shows and a lifetime of cooking naturally evolved into Hare’s Kitchen. Reynolds says she looks forward to hosting the winners of tonight’s competition for a home-cooked meal. “There’ll be a cocktail course, and maybe that will take the edge off of having to perform as admirably in the main course,” she says, referring to the pressure of living up to the great skill displayed by the contestants.


We talk first to team Dreams and NightHares, made up of four blocking group members, as they chop shallots with surgical precision. Tonight’s dish is their rendition of pasta alla vodka, one they perfected during their year living together off-campus.
“It’s our signature dish. We make it all the time as a blocking group,” says team member Rio M. McLellan ’22-23.
Next to them is Alan O. Wang ’24, cooking a vegan stir fry. That part is easy for him. The challenge comes when the secret ingredient, which every group has to incorporate into their dish, is unveiled — cranberries. Yet this twist is no match for Wang, who goes right along simmering them down to add to his sauce.
As we grill the contestants on their best techniques, Deschler runs back and forth from the kitchen wielding strainers, red wine vinegar, or anything the contestants need to achieve gastronomical greatness.
We stop by the tables of The Four Musketeers and Ily Loves to Cook making handcrafted dumplings and a fall-flavored soup, respectively. The Musketeers operate in succession, with their sous chef Kevin Liu ’23 leading the way. One team member mixes the filling, another rolls the dough into a flat circle, and Liu folds the dumplings with care.


The Ily Loves to Cook team argues about the best practice for chopping cranberries as their bubbling broth boiled on. “She’s one half my sous chef, and one half my saboteur,” Cierra M. Brown ’23 says of her teammate Maureen Clare ’23.
Now hungry, we wander to the Leverett servery to see what was on the HUDS menu, stopping in our tracks to find a full pan of golden brown monkey bread — another Leverett tradition revived by the interim faculty deans. Paired with whipped cream and berries, the combination is enough to make us forget about Annenberg for a few bites.
Meanwhile, the warnings of the Hare’s Kitchen commentator, Obasi, loudly pierce the room: “Fifteen minutes left! Chop chop!”
At this point, things are picking up — it’s getting warmer, and Deschler opens a window. As Reynolds worries about setting off a fire alarm, a hot pan sizzles wildly. Sauces are reducing, breads are roasting, and someone opens a bottle of vodka. (Don’t worry, it’s for the pasta)
As Maggie Vallejo ’23, a contestant on the Four Musketeers, packs the dumpling dough with filling, a teammate pulls back her hair. The team is on a tight schedule; they have to leave for section in a few minutes.
The final minutes wane to a close. Judges line up at the table in front of the dishes, which have been plated with precision. Each is impressive in both taste and presentation, and each uses the secret ingredient in a creative way.
But there must be a winner. As the judges confer, we try the delicious leftovers of each team. Soon, a winner is revealed.
For their impressive technique and charming presentation, the Four Musketeers and their domineering dumplings come out on top. Though, at this point, they’ve already left for section.

If you tune into WHRB radio on any Tuesday evening, you might catch a Greek-accented, gravelly voice welcoming you to “Our Little Rendez-vous.” From 10 to 11 p.m., you’ll hear an eclectic mix of songs usually dating from the ’60s, softly crackling from a steady rotation of 45 rpm records.
The man behind the voice, dropping the needle on one of an endless supply of carefully chosen records, is none other than Constantinos “Dinos” Mekios, a 51-year-old resident DJ at WHRB. By day, he’s a philosophy professor at Stonehill College; by night, he selects a record to play out of his collection of over 55,000. Mekios has hosted his show at WHRB for longer than most of the student DJs have been alive. He chuckles, “At this point, after 23 years, people assume that I’m part of the furniture of the station.”
While growing up in Athens — only exposed to his father’s classical collection and the songs played on the state-controlled radio — Mekios believed he “didn’t like music at all.” It was only when he turned 17 and his uncle introduced him to records ranging from Jimi Hendrix and The Stooges to the German krautrock band CAN that he realized, “Oh, it’s not just the music in the top 20 … there’s something else that seems to have more urgency, and I like it.”
Mekios began putting his pocket money together to buy obscure records by bands from around the world — once, he bought a suitcase’s worth of records from South Africa. Thus began his lifelong passion for collecting records, though he’s reluctant to call himself a “collector.”
However, the hobby that absorbed most of young Mekios’s energy was not record collecting but basketball. At 19, he moved to New York to attend Stony Brook University in pursuit of his dream to play basketball at a high level. Mekios was a biochemistry major planning to go to medical school until he took a philosophy course to fulfill a requirement; he was hooked and decided to study both. But the scientist in him was stubborn, and after graduating from Stony Brook, he enrolled in a graduate program in genetics at Columbia University.
While at Columbia, Mekios developed his musical taste by attending shows throughout New York City, which he says “completely changed my perspective about music.” He bought records at every show and spent his free time exploring record stores around the city.
While his love for music grew, his passion for research had not. “I realized that I didn’t have the temperament or the patience to do something super specialized,” he says. He was initially drawn to genetics by questions regarding human nature, but he realized he could engage with those questions more deeply through the study of philosophy rather than “spend[ing] every day in the lab doing a lot of technical work and focusing on very, very narrow details about some pathway in a cell.” Mekios transferred to a graduate program at Boston University to get a Ph.D. in the philosophy of biology.
During the summer of 2000, a year into his studies at BU, Mekios ran into a friend from New York who offered to hook him up with a show on WHRB. When Mekios went on air for the first time, he grew hyper-aware of his thick accent and felt overwhelmed by the mechanics of operating the studio.
“I made every mistake one could make,” he laughs. He had dead air for more than a minute and played songs at the wrong speed. But listeners began calling in, appreciating his unique taste. “I guess people were more focused on what I was playing,” he says, smiling. “To hell with whether I speak English well or not; it’s fine. It’s more about the things that I play.”
Soon enough, Mekios became a regular at the studio. Now, he lends his wisdom to each new generation of DJs, teaching them how to use the equipment. “You see how people develop over the time they are at the station, both their tastes and how they develop their leadership skills,” he says He equally enjoys his work teaching philosophy at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts, which he’s been doing since the fall of 2006.
We ask him about how his two passions — music and philosophy — are related. “I think that there’s some kind of curiosity that makes me like exploration in music, and philosophy is some sort of exploration as well, of a different kind,” he says. “Maybe it’s the same kind of curiosity that I find to be appealing in both of these enterprises.”
The same questions about human nature that drew him to his profession also pertain to how he thinks about music. “What is it that shapes us into what we are? What is it that we find meaningful, and what not?” he asks. “What is genius? What is taste, what’s good taste? What does that mean to people? How does it change?”
If there’s one thing that hasn’t changed, it’s that Mekios cares deeply about the quality of the show for his listeners. “I really have to confess that I really don't like to intellectualize a lot of this,” he says, growing unexpectedly uncomfortable in the philosophical turn our conversion took. “I feel like it takes the fun out of the music part. So in the show, I play things that make sense to me because there is some kind of connection in my mind with the things I like to play, but I feel like if I try to comment too much, it usually falls apart.”
When we ask what more he wants in life, his answer is simple: “I don't have enough records,” he laughs, gesturing to the stacks of records behind him in his apartment. “I’m just kidding. That’s probably my demise.”

Freshmen fill Sanders Theatre from wall to wall. The biting scent of cigarette smoke climbs high into the rafters, accompanied by cheer and chatter, and mixes with the musk of hundreds of drunk men. “Her Sexcellency,” Sally Rand — a famous ostrich feather burlesque dancer — performs for the crowd while a beer-drinking competition ensues in Memorial Hall. The annual Freshman Smoker is well underway.
The term “smoker” holds a few modern definitions: a person who habitually smokes tobacco; a device that smokes fish and meat; a handheld instrument used to calm beehives. But in the early 20th century, it also referred to a social gathering of men where smoking tobacco was not only permitted but encouraged. Beginning with the class of 1907, Harvard had its own: the Freshman Smoker, held late in the Spring semester. Organized by the Freshman Smoker Committee and originally held in the Harvard Union building, the Freshman Smoker originated as an event for freshmen to socialize and, of course, smoke.
With only a piano to facilitate group sing-alongs and some light refreshments for its first rendition, its origins were humble. For the next decade, the Freshman Smoker remained small-scale, supplemented by many smaller, more intimate smokers held by various dorms. As one advertisement for the Freshman Smoker for the class of 1918 claims, “These smokers are not held primarily to promote the consumption of tobacco and pretzels. The real reason they are held is to give the men of the class an opportunity to meet each other informally and to get acquainted on common ground.”
By the 1920s and ’30s, the Smoker began to grow into its own. With proper funding from the class president and treasurer, the Freshman Smoker for the class of 1921 featured silent films and music from the Smiths Hall Orchestra. Soon enough, people from every corner of Harvard were giving speeches at the annual event, from deans to football team captains, from the president of the college to sports writers. In 1937, future U.S. president John F. Kennedy ’40 was head of the Freshman Smoker Committee and master of ceremonies for the event. That year, over 1,000 freshmen arrived to watch “elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world,” a Crimson article reported at the time.
With the growing popularity, criticisms of the Smoker’s purpose soon emerged. The Freshman Smoker Committee had grown into the custom of outsourcing its entertainment — ad-lib comedians, dancers, and bands became a staple of the tradition. This entertainment was not cheap, and some criticized the sizable budget allocated for the single evening, arguing funds could be better spent on causes like scholarship aid.
With its expensive festivities and the advent of dozens of kegs of beer for each rendition, the Freshman Smoker had drifted from its origins as a casual get-together to promote class unity into a far more chaotic revelry. Through the ’40s and into the ’50s, the Freshman Smoker was continually marred by rowdiness and injuries.
In a particularly severe year, two freshmen in the class of 1957 were hospitalized for days following the event. One freshman living in Wigglesworth failed to get far enough away from a firecracker he made with his friends, and the home-made explosive blew up in his face. The other freshman, a Holworthy resident, engaged in a post-Smoker fight and was sent to the hospital with a head injury.
But despite these accidents, many faculty and students defended the Smoker. As John Vernon Patrick, Jr. ’52, proctor in the Yard and advisor to the committee, described, “It was too bad that the two events had to mar an otherwise perfect evening.” Despite Dean Von Stade, Jr. ’37 defending the smoker as “a healthy and happy outlet” for freshmen and subsequent attempts by the Committee to tone down its chaos, the violence spelled doom for the decades-old tradition.
In 1959, the Smoker Investigation Committee, created specifically to look into the dangers of events such as the Freshman Smoker and advise the Freshman Union Committee on how to act, recommended the immediate and complete abolition of the event. “We have the chance of a lifetime, a chance to remove the stench of the Smoker from coming classes,” Fred Sander ’59 told the Crimson at the time.
The Freshman Union Committee was unable to garner a two-thirds majority vote to abolish the tradition, so the University took over, and the class of ‘59 became the last to hold a Smoker. As Dean Von Stade described in a 1959 report: “Attempts were made, over the past few years, to initiate various measures to make the Smoker a pleasant outlet for mid-winter tensions without running the risk of loss of control of the situation. These attempts failed, and the Smoker has been abolished.”

We arrived via overnight bus. Dozens of bedraggled Harvard undergraduates, some still in their Halloween costumes, joined a few graduate students on a 3 a.m. bus to Washington, D.C on October 30. We got to the capital just in time for lunch and a speaker series about the event that brought us there: the oral arguments in two Supreme Court cases on affirmative action, Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. The University of North Carolina. The next day, after a marginally better night’s sleep than the one before, we went to a rally outside the Supreme Court.
We were a sea of pale blue t-shirts, buttons, and bandanas, waving posters, chugging coffee, and huddling around a podium. The rally began, and a man stepped up to the mic to introduce himself.
“My name is Rakim Brooks, and I’m president of the Alliance for Justice, and I am a beneficiary of affirmative action,” he said.
“How many of you are beneficiaries of affirmative action? Raise your hand,” Brooks continued. I raise my hand — I’d heard this line many times this weekend — as does most of the crowd.
“Everybody’s hands should be up,” he says, and everybody’s hands go up, “because the secret they don’t want you to know is that we all benefit from affirmative action.” We cheered, the #DefendDiversity slogans on our apparel undulating like a wave of progressive blue beetles.
“White, Black, brown — whoever you are, wherever you come from, you are a beneficiary of affirmative action. When one of us succeeds, all of us succeed, particularly when that success is rooted in equity,” Brooks says. A high pitched “woot” cuts through his brief pause. He continues: “It’s just that simple.”
Not long after Brooks’s speech, it started drizzling, and then pouring. The camera crews began to leave. I huddled with the other students under umbrellas as the speakers continued, until the rain got to be too much for a few of us who walked over to a nearby church and listened to a broadcast of the Supreme Court’s oral arguments.
The decades-old practice of affirmative action in university admissions is on the line, and with the court’s conservative supermajority, it’s not sounding good for our side — the side defending race-conscious admissions at Harvard. We expected this, but it was still hard to hear. We could tell things were off to a bad start when, in the UNC case, Justice Clarence Thomas said, “I’ve heard the word ‘diversity’ quite a few times, and I don’t have a clue what it means. It seems to mean everything for everyone.” Everyone in the church groaned.
At the end of October, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for SFFA v. Harvard and SFFA v. The University of North Carolina, two lawsuits spearheaded by Edward J. Blum, a tireless conservative activist who has been hellbent for decades on eliminating affirmative action. Though not a lawyer, Blum has backed over two dozen lawsuits that include efforts to strike down race-conscious admissions as well as attempts to challenge voting rights. In 2013, a Blum-led suit that reached the Supreme Court dismantled a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Three years later, he narrowly lost in Fisher v. University of Texas, a case in which Blum’s plaintiff, Abigail Fisher, alleged that the University of Texas had discriminated against her in its admissions process because she is white.
After years of representing white clients in affirmative action lawsuits, Blum recalibrated — in the Harvard case, SFFA alleges that the University discriminates against Asian applicants in favor of Black, Hispanic, and Native American ones. In the UNC case, Blum alleges discrimination against both white and Asian applicants.
It appears almost certain that the decades-old Supreme Court precedent upholding affirmative action will be overturned. With a 6-3 conservative majority on the court and the recusal in the Harvard case of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson ’92 because of her former seat on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the question is not whether affirmative action will be gutted, but whether it will be entirely gutted.
That approximately 40 percent of colleges and universities currently use some form of affirmative action means that the outcomes of the Harvard and UNC cases will have tangible and troubling consequences. We know this because it has already happened in California, in Michigan, and the seven other states that banned affirmative action in public universities. In the wake of these bans, flagship state schools have spent decades — and millions of dollars — trying to bring the number of Black and Latinx students back to what they once were. They have not been successful.
In 2020, Black students comprised only 3.7 percent of Berkeley’s student body, about half of what it had in 1990; last year, Berkeley had only 27 Native students out of an incoming class of almost 7,000. Black and Latinx students are less represented at elite public universities than they were 35 years ago. Modeling for the University’s team suggests that if Harvard stopped considering race in its admissions process, it would also experience a substantial change: the number of Black students would decrease by more than half, the number of Asian students would increase by a few percentage points, and the number of white students would increase the most.
The statistics make clear that eliminating race-conscious admissions dramatically decreases diversity. For Blum, this was not surprising — eliminating diversity seems very well to be one of his goals. But what was surprising was the fact that Harvard’s lawyer, Seth P. Waxman ’73, struggled to defend the University’s practices, too.
“Race for some highly qualified applicants can be the determinative factor, just as being an oboe player in a year in which the Harvard-Radcliffe orchestra needs an oboe player will be the tip,” he said. To which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ’76 shot back, “We did not fight a civil war about oboe players.”
Listening to the arguments, I got a sense that there was something missing in Waxman’s thinking — something that went beyond the imperative of “diversity,” something that Waxman just couldn’t say.
The diversity rationale for affirmative action –– the idea that we should use race-conscious admissions because of a university’s overarching interest in creating diverse student bodies –– is not popular among the general public. Around three-fourths of Americans oppose the use of race as a factor in college admissions, according to a Pew Research poll conducted earlier this year. Most Democrats oppose it, most Black people oppose it, and most Asian people oppose it.
Even the students at the rally in Washington, clad in #DefendDiversity paraphernalia, seemed wary of the limits of this slogan. David Lewis ’24, the political action chair of the Black Students Association, said to the crowd, “Don’t be confused by our Defend Diversity slogan. I did not come here to prove to racists that my Black peers and I belong. I didn’t come here to beg white people. I didn’t come to prove that we can improve other students’ educational experiences by adding spice and flavor to some melting pot, and I sure as hell did not come to prove that we are affirmative action imposters taking spots from supposedly smarter and more qualified white students.”
Implicit within Lewis’s statement was a skepticism of a kind of hollow diversity that primarily serves the interests of white people and elite institutions. Indeed, many of Waxman’s arguments seemed to be about the benefits that students of color bring to educational spaces. So, is this what diversity at Harvard means? Is this what it has always meant? Listening to the lawyers and justices circle around, yet gesture toward, something else, I wondered: what — and who — is affirmative action really for? If there is more to this case than diversity, what will we lose when we lose affirmative action?
Race has never been absent here. From the school’s literal inception, nonwhite people, specifically Black and Indigenous people, have lived and worked at Harvard. Race existed here, with force, as a violent social construct. Of course it did — race is at the foundation of this country.
In the middle of Old Yard, where a cluster of colorful aluminum chairs now sits on a patch of yellowing grass, there once stood a brick building designated as Harvard’s Indian College. A plaque in front of Matthews Hall reads, “Here American Indian and English students lived and worked in accordance with the 1650 Charter calling for the education of the English and Indian youth of this country.”
The Natives at Harvard College point to this history in their draft statement for media releases about the SFFA case, highlighting that Indigenous students attended the Indian College Harvard built on native land while their communities experienced “plague, warfare, colonialism, and the pressures of assimilationist and education practices.” Harvard created the Indian College with an explicit assimilationist intent — the male Native students who ate, studied, and lived alongside their white counterparts were supposed to absorb the Puritan teachings of the school and spread these ideas to their communities.
Harvard is still governed by the Charter of 1650, a colonial document where the fledgling Harvard Corporation outlined its institutional goals. In the charter, college is spelled “colledge” and godliness — spelled “godlynes” — is one of the school’s foundational principles. So, too, is “the education of English and Indian youth.”
When Harvard wrote the Charter of 1650, and when Harvard established the Indian College, the buying, selling, and trading of both Black and Indigenous people was legal in Massachusetts and practiced on campus.
This spring, the University released a report on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, a 100-plus-page document outlining the school’s financial, intellectual, and direct ties to slavery. In an introductory section on Indigenous and African slavery, the report describes, for instance, how the summer after Harvard’s founding in 1636, the ship named Desire left carrying 17 Pequot War prisoners and, after the enslavement of these people in Bermuda, returned two years later to the Boston Harbor with an unknown number of Africans. One of those Africans, the report suggests, may have been a man enslaved by Harvard’s first schoolmaster, Nathaniel Eaton.
This man, known only as “The Moor” within official archives, could have known the Pequot woman whom John Winthrop, one of the founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony and a namesake of Winthrop House, enslaved before the Desire’s initial departure. The man called “The Moor” and the woman enslaved by Winthrop might have been on campus when Caleeb Cheeschateamuck became Harvard’s first Native American graduate in 1665. It is possible that these two men and this one woman knew similar shortcuts around this campus, that they crossed paths during their daily routines, that they made eye contact during stolen moments of leisure.
The undergraduate Affirmative Action Coalition held a speaker event with Harvard Institute of Politics fellows Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor of Constitutional Law at John Jay College, and Judith LeBlanc, the executive director of the Native Organizers Alliance. Partway through the conversation, Browne-Marshall and LeBlanc began discussing the role of “diversity” within the SFFA case. Browne-Marshall critiqued the idea of “diversity” as the end all be all of justice — from the shores of Virginia to Boston Harbor, she said, this country has always been “diverse.” So when we talk about diversity now, we must really mean something else.
Affirmative action was originally meant to benefit Black and Indigenous people whose families had endured generations of white supremacy, as well as women of all races barred from educational and professional opportunities. President John F. Kennedy ’40 first used the term in 1961 when he established the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, urging federal contractors to take “affirmative action to ensure that applicants are treated equally without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson required all government contractors to use affirmative action to promote equal employment opportunities. Policies specifically aimed at increasing the numbers of women and racial minorities continued under the Johnson, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan administrations.
However, the system we have today is a flimsy version of the original. Whittled down over the years, affirmative action rests on shaky ground — not only in the courts, but within its own logic. What emerged from the Civil Rights Movement as one way to address centuries of oppression against Black and Indigenous people transformed into a justification for race-conscious admissions that cannot account for histories of racism or its ongoing effects. Instead, within higher education, we have the diversity rationale. As established by the course in two key affirmative action cases, schools can take race into account during admissions because of a state interest in diversity of all kinds — racial, socioeconomic, and geographic.
Theodore M. Shaw, the former president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, witnessed the decline.
“I was at the Supreme Court on June 28, 1978, when Bakke was decided or announced,” he told a crowd of activists, lawyers, and organizers the day before the oral arguments. “I left the court devastated because even though we, I, have fought to defend diversity ever since then, for African Americans at the moment that Bakke was decided, and frankly still today in significant ways, Bakke was a loss — I don’t have time to explain all that.”
What Shaw didn’t have time to explain was that Justice Lewis Powell’s majority opinion 44 years ago in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke changed everything. In the case, a 35-year-old white man applying to medical school alleged the University of Davis’s racial quota system infringed upon his Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court was split down the middle. Four justices believed that the cap on white students violated Title XI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race for any institution that receives federal funding, while the other four ruled it did not. Siding with the university, Justice Harry Blackmun ’29 famously wrote, “In order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently.”
Powell saw things differently. He believed in the permissibility of race-conscious admissions but held a less progressive view about our collective responsibility to address racism, writing, “There is a measure of inequity in forcing innocent persons in [Bakke’s] position to bear the burdens of redressing grievances not of their making.” His ruling prevented the use of a racial quota system but allowed universities to take race into consideration because of schools’ “compelling” interest in having a diverse student body. This rationale gave new meaning to the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. It became the cornerstone of future affirmative action cases, namely Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003, which upheld the University of Michigan Law School’s affirmative action policies for its intent to promote diversity. Now, SFFA is asking the court to overturn Grutter.
This diversity rationale has guided colleges’ approach to expanding their numbers of minority students and accounting for societal inequities. “I think that the basic narrowness of what the court allows for affirmative action to be is in a lot of ways responsible for this, right? It can’t be a reparative thing,” New Yorker staff writer Jay Caspian Kang tells me in an interview. “It would be illegal if it was.”
These shifts around affirmative action can make the discourse surrounding it dizzying. “Here’s why I hate talking about affirmative action,” says Anthony Abraham Jack, an assistant professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “It has been forced to change so much from addressing past wrongs that were written into American law, that was the DNA of American culture, to now saying that having a Black or a Latinx classmate is a benefit to white people, therefore, it’s a benefit to society. Yeah. So when you talk about affirmative action, it’s like, which wave? After which court case?”
No one should be surprised the diversity rationale has fared so well. Everyone’s included — what’s not to like? Diversity conveniently benefits every powerful institution in this country and every white person in this country hoping to become powerful. It connotes an image of a gentle white man active listening to a Black woman emphatically detail her generational trauma. He is moved, he’s learned so much, and the two cooperate so well together that they generate the most revenue in all of McKinsey’s history. Put simply, diversity has neoliberal vibes. I saw a sign at the rally that read, “Diversity is good for white people.”
Throughout the hearings, various conservative justices — Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett — questioned Waxman when race-conscious admissions will end, referencing the majority opinion from Grutter, which predicted that “ 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.” After a tense exchange with Gorsuch, who said curtly, “It’s a real simple question. If Harvard doesn’t have an answer, that’s fine, but does Harvard have some view about when?”, Waxman responded that the University does not.
If Waxman wasn’t bound by a diversity rationale, his answer to the conservative justices’ questions about affirmative action’s end date would be more straightforward: affirmative action will no longer be necessary when racial disparities become indiscernible.
“I wish I didn’t have to believe in affirmative action, right? I think it’s a very flawed system,” Chelsea Wang ’25, the political action chair of the Asian American Association, tells me. “It doesn’t feel right to judge people by their race and even to note that.” But we don’t have the leisure of living in a colorblind world. Wang continues, “I will support affirmative action as long as people are still disadvantaged by their race.”
Wang’s perspective on the necessity of affirmative action elucidates an irony about the whole debate. Even though schools and courtrooms are bound by the diversity rationale, common-sense understandings of affirmative action are about equity. “At some fundamental level, everybody knows — Harvard knows, the University of North Carolina knows, the challengers know — that the reason for affirmative action programs is something like either restorative justice or contemporary distributive justice,” says Mark V. Tushnet ’67, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.
An underlying belief that affirmative action should be redistributive is why people often react with unease when they learn that Generational African Americans, a term for people whose descendants were enslaved in this country and have lived here for generations, are underrepresented within Black populations at elite institutions. While the University does not release data within racial groups — only what the overarching Black population is — this is an unspoken truth widely acknowledged within Harvard’s Black community. We know that affirmative action, as Harvard has practiced it, has achieved cosmetic diversity while failing to open up seats to the communities that bear the brunt of systemic racism.
We know that anti-Blackness and anti-Indigeneity are two specific kinds of American evils. We do not need to know that intergenerational mobility for these two groups is lower than all other demographics in the country — and that even being born into a wealthy family does not insulate these two groups from future economic precarity — to understand this. But we fear confronting this knowledge will unravel everything else. As Kiersten B. Hash ’25 says, “conceding that we need to consider race as a factor in college admissions is conceding that systemic racism exists — period, point blank — in this country.”
Our implicit commitment to distributive justice also explains why the wealth disparities at schools like Harvard feel like such a betrayal of the schools’ values. Over three times as many students come from the top 1 percent than from the bottom 20 percent. And Harvard’s less stratified than its Ivy peers! At Brown, the median parent income is over $200,000, and more students came from the top 0.1 percent than the bottom 20 percent. Kang calls these schools “elite egalitarian,” because “the one thing that everyone is there is, pretty much across the board, rich now.”
In the Harvard Class of 2019, only 29 percent of Black and Hispanic students were “disadvantaged,” meaning that their parents made less than $80,000 or didn’t have a college degree. Among the general U.S. population, the median income of Black households in the United is only around $48,000.
Speaking on the disproportionate wealth within historically disadvantaged minority groups, Kang notes that this “doesn’t mean that, like, every minority kid at Harvard or one of these schools is from a wealthy doctor background, but some of them are, and the schools, I think, are quite dishonest about that.” Still, the perversion of affirmative action, from a Civil Rights Movement effort to address past harm into a loosely defined system to create multicultural Disneylands of predominantly wealthy students, leaves progressives in a pickle.
Before Roberts castigated Waxman about oboe players, the Chief Justice proposed a predictable but mostly misguided hypothetical about a Black legacy applicant who grew up in Grosse Pointe, an affluent suburb in Michigan. Roberts said, “I mean, you’re concerned about diversity of viewpoint. Let’s say his viewpoints tend to be very close to the white applicants and he grew up in Grosse Pointe, had a great upbringing, comfortable, his parents went to Harvard, he’s a legacy, and yet, under your system, when he checks African American, he gets a tip.” Waxman responded that race isn’t always a relevant factor for admission — under Harvard’s race-conscious admission policy, race is allowed to be a “tip” for applicants, but that doesn’t mean this always happens. In fact, race is rarely the definitive “tip.” Roberts’s statement that this hypothetical applicant gets a tip as soon as he “checks African American” is false.
Still, in this exchange, the competing logics of diversity and redistribution collapse on themselves. I had two immediate reactions from Roberts’s statements: one, the Chief Justice is right to be skeptical about well-off applicants getting a boost in the admissions process, and two, he’s never met a Black kid from the suburbs. The assumption that this hypothetical Grosse Pointe applicant has viewpoints “very close to the white applicants” and therefore wouldn’t bring the real Blackedy Blackness that Harvard wants from its students of color is wildly insulting and wrong. It implies that class eclipses race — that it removes you from both the violences of racism and the joys of culture and community. Regardless, the framing of Roberts’s question suggests the existence of The Black Perspective; while we want diversity on the macro level, each individual “diverse” candidate should fulfill a racial expectation.
Whatever beliefs this mythical kid has is definitionally a Black perspective, but that’s not the real question Roberts is asking. He’s pointing to the collective understanding that affirmative action should benefit people who come from historically marginalized backgrounds and face socioeconomic disadvantage, which I believe is true. Given the realities that multiple studies have shown that socioeconomic affirmative action decreases racial diversity (helping less advantaged white people more than any marginalized racial group), we arrive once again at Blackmun’s epithet that to address racism we must take account of race.
A better version of affirmative action should specifically target socioeconomically disadvantaged people of color, but, of course, that wasn’t the question at hand. The question at hand was whether a made-up Black kid from Michigan can really say he’s Black even though his mom is a lawyer or something.
Despite its occasional shallowness, diversity is still a baseline good backed by empirical evidence. Research on diversity in college environments suggests it increases critical thinking, self-confidence, and student motivation across the board. There’s also the annoying but understandable evidence that diversity specifically benefits white students. According to The Century Foundation, “the presence of students of color stimulates an increase in the complexity with which white students approach a given issue.” While we get to cosplay as tricky little riddles for our white classmates, a noted benefit of diversity for students of color is that people are less likely to be racist toward us because we have strength in numbers.
During the rally at the Supreme Court and at the event the day before, I noticed that many of the speeches referenced one of two things: experiences in majority minority underfunded schools and neighborhoods, or experiences being The Only One in the room. Both of these memories understandably led students to connect the value of diversity to the imperative for affirmative action.
Though I was deeply moved by the students’ stories, these two kinds of justifications for affirmative action made me realize that neither of them captured my own experience. If you amalgamated the faces of all the people I’m closest to, the result would look a lot like that slightly fetishizing National Geographic article that said everyone would be Blasian or whatever in 2050. The diverse and privileged upbringing I had probably contributes to my cynicism of diversity as a judicially defensible metric. I love my diverse classrooms, diverse friend groups, and diverse family more than anything, but after 22 years living as a poster child for the “what are you” question, I’m almost insulted at the idea that diversity is the pinnacle of social justice, rather than a nurturing way to live life and find community.
“We can’t just be here for diversity sake and then face onslaughts of racial abuse — aka microaggressions — on the daily and be expected to just take it on and then become these mammies and educate all these white kids from the suburbs,” says Hash. “That’s not our job. That’s Harvard’s job.”
For many student activists on campus, the University is not their usual ally. The prison divestment movement, recent graduate student strikes, and support for the Lanier family to retain the daguerreotypes of their enslaved ancestors all critique Harvard practices and inequities. But in the legal fight for affirmative action, there’s an “intersecting interest,” Hash says. She continues, “It is good that, at least for now, we have elite institutions supporting affirmative action, even if it’s not for the same reasons. I think we always have to level-set as a community and recognize our fight is not their fight.”
There’s a pretty universal sentiment among affinity groups, for instance, that the school proudly claims us when it’s convenient for them but shies away from our institutional demands. This disconnect leaves students doubting the moral purity behind the University’s diversity efforts — and creates added pressure to solve institutional gaps within their community. Hash describes it as a feeling of “running around and trying to put your hands on everything.”
“You can get burnt out so quickly, because you really feel like the institution doesn’t care, and then they only care when it’s convenient to them,” Hash says, “and then [you’re] expected to turn around and have to organize like it’s your duty, it’s your right as a Black person. Mind you, we’re in midterm season.” Jack’s 2019 book “The Privileged Poor” demonstrates the inequities less privileged students face once accepted into selective schools. His analysis squares with Hash’s experience: “Everyone is talking about getting in, but no one is talking about what happens when students are on campus.”
In a conversation with me a couple weeks before the event, Lewis described how even as he’s “been joining in with these Defend Diversity hashtags and liners that do well according to the media and polls,” it doesn’t always sit right with him.
He said that his educational experience before college was isolating. The only Black person in his K-8 environment, he was forced to endure racism and microaggressions no one took seriously. He felt like he couldn’t fully be himself. “Coming to Harvard,” he said, “It’s still a PWI, but there’s a Black community that’s not just me.”
“I think now I’m somebody who is able to join this cause, fight for what I believe in, say whatever I want to say, even if it may not be palatable to white peers or authority figures, in part because I have like Black upperclassmen, Black authority figures,” says Lewis, whose experience of self-growth flips the script about who we implicitly consider the protagonists of diversity stories. He does feel indebted to the diversity of Harvard’s campus — but to him, that means Harvard’s Black community.
One of the more upsetting parts of the hearing was an exchange between Waxman and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. about the University’s assigning Asian applicants the lowest “personal rating” compared to all other racial groups. Harvard’s lawyers say this number is practically meaningless within the admissions process, but the personality rating actually seems like the cornerstone of the holistic process. Admissions officers overview the students’ non-academic materials — essays, high school recommendations, alumni interviews — to adjudicate the “integrity, courage, kindness, and empathy” of the applicants.
Waxman told the court that there is no evidence Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and said the personal rating is just “a matter of triage.” In our conversation, Tushnet says, “there were examples in the case of what can only be described as express discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Harvard’s student leaders and activists don’t see it this way. The members of the Affirmative Action Auxiliary board I spoke to, as well as representatives from Asian American legal and justice organizations, emphatically rejected the suggestion of anti-Asian bias within the case.
“If we uncovered evidence that affirmative action was operating to discriminate against Asian Americans, we would be on the side challenging affirmative action, not defending,” Marita Etcubañez, the senior director of strategic initiatives of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said in her speech on the steps of the Supreme Court. “But that’s not what’s happening, despite what our opposition is alleging.”
Indeed, the trial court in the SFFA v. Harvard case did not find evidence of racial discrimination against Asian applicants. The AAJC, as well as the students I spoke to, also pointed to the growth of Asian American representation within the Harvard population, from 3 percent in 1980 to the nearly 30 percent we see today.
Organizers cautioned against falling for the “Asian penalty gap” narrative, saying that Asian Americans were assigned “very slightly weaker personal ratings — only 0.05 points difference between Asian American and white applicants” and noting that applicants of all races receive weaker personal ratings from admissions officers than from alumni interviews.
In sum, AAJC concluded that in contrast to SFFA’s claims, Asian Americans benefit from race-conscious admissions. The group cites a Georgetown report that suggests more than one-fifth of current Asian American students at elite schools would not have been accepted under a test-only admissions practice.
When we spoke before the oral arguments, Kang said Asian American students were treated in a way that was “at least weird,” and worthy of attention.
“I understand the theory. The fear is what’s going to probably happen in the next couple of weeks and that there needs to be a full-on defense. So even if you quietly disagree with it, then you just kind of swallow it because there’s a bigger game at play,” Kang says. But he adds that while this mindset makes sense for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund or nonprofits organizing around affirmative action, he doesn’t think “it should be the job of journalists to talk about things in that sort of way.”
For Asian American Harvard students advocating to preserve affirmative action, the fight stems from a belief in the importance of forging cross-racial solidarity and dispeling racist myths about Asians. “The stereotype claims that we are apolitical, hardworking, that we are really only here to work for our own benefit, our own gain. And that isn’t true,” Wang says. “They’re saying that we are willing to ignore the racism against other people, and that we would do anything to benefit ourselves.”
SFFA’s claims, students contend, portray Asians as a monolith and exacerbate the dangerous effects of the model minority myth, which Kylan N. Tatum ’25 says “obscures the social, political, and historical struggles of Asian Americans” and “seeks to explain the position of other minority groups through frameworks of inherent inferiority or laziness, instead of as a product of social barriers.”
“Being both Black and Asian myself, I often see attempts to misrepresent both of those groups,” says Tatum, who serves as political action chair for the Asian American Association alongside Wang. “There are members of my family who I know smarter than who were not able to graduate high school or were not able to go to college because of a variety of structural barriers.”
By stereotyping Asian applicants, SFFA is indeed erasing socioeconomic and educational disparities within the umbrella term of “Asian,” a group that is the most economically divided of any racial group in the country. Quyên Đinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, describes how affirmative action specifically benefits Southeast Asians. According to SEARAC, 27 percent of Vietnamese, 17 percent of Cambodian and Hmong, and 14 percent of Laoitan Americans hold a bachelor’s degree or higher; in contrast, 70 percent of South Asian Americans do.
“We’re here because we believe in admissions policies that see that we are more than a number,” Đinh says. “And that is part of my story and our story, and my SAT score that didn’t even break 1000 was my story.”
She lists aspects of her upbringing that exist beyond grades and scores that complicate her narrative: born and raised in low-income neighborhoods; an English language learner; a proud daughter of a single dad; a byproduct of a beautiful but under-resourced K-12 education system. “Driving myself to the SATs, filling out my own FAFSA, and only then finding out just how poor we were when I saw my dad’s tax return,” she continues. “My story, our story, should not be the minority but the norm.”
Again, Harvard doesn’t release statistics on intraracial demographics, but just as GAA students suspect they are a minority among Black students, it’s a common sentiment in Asian affinity groups that East Asians and South Asians constitute the majority of Harvard’s Asian population. In a 2017 Crimson op-ed, Elizabeth Y. Sun ’19 wrote, “When I think Asian, I think East Asian and then Indian. A lot of this has to do with the fact that I am Chinese American, but even more has to do with the fact that these are essentially the only two areas of Asia that I see represented at Harvard.” Similarly, the grad student union’s recent win of instituting a formal anti-caste discrimination policy at the University brought to light the low population of marginalized-caste students and the casteism some have experienced here.
Students oppose SFFA’s efforts because they can see that SFFA does not have Asian students’ best interests at heart. Anyone responsible for gutting the Voting Rights Act cannot have Asian people’s best interests at heart. Anyone whose decades-long political career has only served white people cannot understand the fraught, unstable position that Asian Americans occupy in this country. Solidarity is a sticky thing; the immediate interests of all marginalized groups don’t always coalesce, and yet our long-term interests always do.
Indeed, SFFA is alleging racism within Harvard’s allocation personal scores, yet their hopeful outcome — the termination of affirmative action — wouldn’t get rid of the personal score at all. In other words, as Harvard Law School Professor Jeannie Suk Gerson wrote in a recent article, “The practice of race-conscious admissions is not what has limited the number of Asian American students; it is instead the parts of the process in which Harvard claims not to think about race at all.” In the absence of race-conscious admissions, the University will probably rely more on personality ratings, as they “play with formulas to produce a diverse class in which Asian admissions don’t get unacceptably out of proportion,” Suk Gerson writes.
According to SFFA’s own logic, the ending of affirmative action could put Asian applicants in greater danger of implicit or explicit discrimination.“If anything,” Suk Gerson writes, “the personal-ratings morass may suggest that what’s needed to check unconscious biases are more transparently and forthrightly race-conscious efforts, not less.”
Sally Chen ’19, who testified for Harvard in the 2018 district court trial, connected the rise in nationwide anti-Asian violence to the imperative of defending affirmative action. “None of our issues exist in silos,” she said to the hundreds of predominantly Asian advocates preparing to rally before the Court. “With this precipitous rise in hate-fueled injustices against Asian Americans across the country … I’m reminded of what this case is really about. It’s protecting our civil rights, and when I say civil rights, I mean all of our rights.”
It’s unclear what the post-affirmative action world of elite institutions is going to look like. Harvard’s modeling suggests that ending race-conscious admissions would halve the number of Black, Latinx, Native, Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students at the University. But others say the most selective schools won’t change very much; Harvard, for instance, might be an edge case. With over 60,000 applicants last year competing for less than 2,000 spots, the College may have the leeway to craft a racially diverse class without the explicit use of race.
Tushnet and Kang predict that overturning affirmative action won’t materially look that different, at least not at Harvard. “They’ll be a sort of headline victory for the challengers and they’ll walk away saying, ‘we’re satisfied with this ideological victory.’ And then outcomes on the ground are not going to change all that much.”
While the numbers on Harvard’s campus may not change dramatically, students of color may experience new pressures within the admissions process. They will likely be encouraged to highlight their racial or ethnic background in their personal essay. With the infamous “box” to check one’s race eliminated, admissions officers may search for racial “proxies,” and some students (and their counselors) will be inclined to foreground their racial identities.
But if students don’t — or can’t — disclose their race, proxies will fill the void of the box. Jack finds this process deeply insufficient. “First gen is not a proxy for race. Social class is not a proxy for race. What I fear is that there is no proxy for race because nothing gets at what is captured in the history of exclusion in this country than what box you check as your racial or ethnic group,” he says.
But the larger question, it seems, for Kang and Tushnet, is whether it’s worthwhile to focus on schools like Harvard. Tushnet considers this hyperfixation on elite institutions a major misstep, when the reality is that “the engines for social and economic advancement is getting a college degree from wherever you get it, and the more high school students who are qualified to get college degrees and who get them, the better our nation will be.”
In a recent piece for the New Yorker, Kang basically called Harvard irredeemable: “The real tragedy here is that the most consequential ruling on affirmative action had to come out of the Harvard case, given that there’s so little to admire or even defend about the most exclusive and élite institution of higher education in the U.S., perhaps even the world.” Between lower admissions standards for legacies, donors, and athletes, and student bodies that simultaneously mimic the racial diversity and credit card limits of the Gossip Girl reboot cast, Kang thinks Harvard, and schools like it, are inequitable to the point of no return.
“There’s nothing that those schools can do that’s going to make any type of difference unless they stop being what they are, right? And they’re never going to stop being what they are,” he tells me. “I don’t think it’s quite like, ‘who cares?’ Because obviously, these are very powerful institutions that do occupy a ton of the public’s imagination; I don’t think you can change that.”
Instead, Kang believes we need to be more realistic about what the possibilities of change would actually look like. “I think my prescription for this has always been much more radical than being able to change the admissions system within schools,” he says. “I think that America needs to break its addiction to exclusivity.”
After the five hours of oral arguments, Elie Mystal ’00, a justice correspondent for the Nation, tweeted the most likely outcomes of this ruling: “Racist white people will be happy. AAPI people will not be helped. Harvard will continue admitting diverse classes of students. Non-elite schools will take a nosedive in terms of Black representation.” When I read this on the nine-hour bus ride from Washington, I struggled to digest the bleak assessment. As flawed and inequitable as I find Harvard’s admissions process and as dubious as I am that transformational change will emerge from the most elitist places in the world, the central fact is that the court will likely prevent more young people of color from gaining access to places of power.
I know this is probably more ideological than material; that Harvard and its hyper-elite peers may even look the same; that the disproportionate wealth here means these schools are defending a hypocritical set of standards; that great swaths of lower-privileged students will ascend into the middle class through colleges that don’t give a rat’s ass about affirmative action because they don’t need to.
All this is true, and yet the ending of affirmative action is devastating. Even if this case was purely ideological — which it’s not — the ideology of affirmative action dissenters is at best a flippancy about Black, Indigenous, and Latinx students existing in elite spaces, and at worst an active attempt to prevent us from entering places like Harvard. “They believe they have this kind of apriori right of ownership of spots at Harvard and Yale and Princeton and Stanford, right? Like we’ve let in too many people by lowering our standards,” Jack says. “But what they're really saying is, ‘we should have those spots, they should be automatically geared towards us.’ And a lot of that gets lost in the dialogue.”
Regardless of proxies or edge cases or anything, the material outcomes of ending affirmative action means fewer of us in the places where, whether or not they should be, are the bastions of power. Most people in the court that day probably went to Harvard or Yale — all but one Supreme Court Justice attended these two law schools. Anyone who values doing the right thing in this country should be disheartened and embarrassed that the highest court in the land is ensuring that there will be fewer people of color in selective institutions of higher education.
An exchange between Justice Elena Kagan and Cameron T. Norris, the lawyer arguing on behalf of SFFA, reveals the underlying cruelty of Blum’s goals. After Norris noted that “besides its racial statistics” Harvard is “not diverse at all,” citing racial disparities and the fact that only 9 percent of its incoming class are conservative, Kagan asked, “Are you saying now that there is an interest and a compelling interest in racial diversity among other kinds of diversity? I mean, whether Harvard should be more socioeconomically diverse, it probably should be. I mean, is there an interest in racial diversity?”
Norris fumbled a bit, before answering no — diversity is not a compelling interest to justify race-conscious admissions. Kagan pushed him: “The premise of your argument is that even if race-neutral criteria could not achieve the object, Harvard can’t use race-conscious criteria. And that must be because you think it’s just not important enough, isn't that right?” Norris responded that he disagreed and noted that if “Harvard just turned off race in its admission process,” the College would still have 6 percent African Americans, 9 percent Hispanic, so 15 percent underrepresented minorities within its student body (he didn’t mention Indigenous students).
Kagan asked, “So you think that’s good enough? But how about if it were 2 percent? I mean, the nature of your argument is that it doesn’t matter. That’s what the nature of your argument is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Eric J. Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, discussed Covid-19 vaccination and misinformation at a Wednesday webinar as part of the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center’s Diversity in STEM series.
During the webinar, Topol, a cardiologist, addressed misinformation surrounding the Covid vaccine and underscored the importance of sharing easily accessible information to help people make informed medical decisions. Topol was joined in conversation by Belfer Fellow and epidemiologist Syra Madad.
For the past year, Topol has been writing a column called “Ground Truths” on the online platform Substack, where he provides facts about Covid-19 in an attempt to combat health misinformation.
“We have some really bad actors out there — they got thrown off of Twitter and now they’re using Substack,” Topol said. “That also inspired me that maybe they need some antidotes to this toxicity. It’s very difficult to counter misinformation.”
Topol said the United States is “so far behind our peer countries in vaccinations and boosters.”
“We are more exposed,” Topol said. “The only thing we have is a lot more infections and infection-induced immunity and hybrid immunity. We’ll see whether that holds up.”
Topol cited the lack of proper communication on the effectiveness of vaccines as a major cause of vaccine hesitancy.
“We have an issue that people think the vaccines don’t work,” Topol said. “They think they’re basically leaky and faulty. And there’s a lack of understanding that the vaccine is still doing quite a good job of protecting against hospitalizations and deaths and, to some extent at least, long Covid.”
Madad, a faculty member in infectious disease policy at Boston University, said she received criticism and even death threats following a pro-vaccination opinion piece.
“I had written a CNN piece on why I planned on vaccinating my 9 and 7-year-old, and this was last year when the Covid-19 vaccines — the primary series — were made available to that age group. And the next day someone broke into my car, and they smashed the window,” Madad said, though she noted that she was unsure if the events were related.
When asked during the event for his recommendation on how to increase trust in science, Topol said it was important to “lay it out there.”
“That’s the way we should be communicating – that it’s simple terms, no jargon and inside baseball stuff – and that it’s suitable for everyone,” Topol added. “But we don’t do that generally, and it took me decades to realize that that’s how we should be working.”
Topol said he opposed the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s decision to withhold portions of their Covid-19 research findings from the public to better create blanket policies, adding that the medical community must understand that “people can deal with nuances.”
“Rather than trying to come up with a strategy that really was up to that individual’s natural history of their infection, they dumbed it down, and it was just egregious,” Topol said. “What happened as a result is they lose credibility.”
In reference to the next generation of scientists, Topol said it is essential to create an open line of communication with the general public to launch a counterattack against misinformation campaigns.
“We’re not activists. We don’t stand up. We just kind of keep our head down,” Topol said, “We can’t do that anymore — look what’s happened as a result.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale junior Matthew J. Pollack was sitting in a morning lecture on Nov. 1 when he noticed something strange: His classmates were trying to buy tickets to the Harvard-Yale football game from a link Yale’s administration had never publicized.
Pollack said he started “freaking out,” texted more than 10 friends, and soon learned that a leaked link to buy tickets to The Game was circulating around campus.
“I jumped onto the website, and it was literally crashing every two minutes,” Pollack said. “It was completely insane.”
The website displayed roughly 3,000 tickets available to Yale undergraduates, a number that dropped with every refresh, according to Pollack, who ultimately received a ticket. Others fared less well — technical glitches left some students ticketless, while others paid for tickets that were later revoked.
Students later learned the Harvard-Yale ticket purchase link “went live prematurely and in error,” Victoria M. “Vicky” Chun, Yale’s director of athletics, wrote in a Nov. 2 email to Yale students.
“Due to the volume of students attempting to purchase tickets, the system crashed, and resulted in an oversale of tickets and multiple credit card charges,” Chun wrote. “We sincerely apologize for these errors and the ways they have impacted you.”
Yale’s Athletics Ticket Office emailed students with ticket confirmations by 5 p.m. on Nov. 3, per Chun’s email, but did not announce another round of ticket sales. Students who were charged for tickets but did not receive confirmations will receive refunds, according to the email.
Josephine W. Cureton, a junior at Yale, said she spent at least an hour trying to get a ticket.
“It was kind of really hectic,” Cureton said.
Though Cureton’s credit card was charged in the process, she said she did not receive a ticket confirmation until she reached out to Yale Athletics directly.
Sukesh Ram, a Yale senior who was unable to snag a ticket, said he was “really disappointed” the university has not announced a plan to sell more tickets through an “official channel.”
“They either need to find a bigger stadium, honestly, when it’s hosted at Harvard, or they need to just make sure, obviously, something like that doesn’t happen,” said Ram, who is still seeking a ticket. “Yale should try harder to maybe have viewing parties or find some kind of alternative that’s more equitable, because there’s 6,000 undergrads, and what are we supposed to do?”
Yale spokesperson Karen Peart did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
Senior Herman L. Peng was unable to buy a ticket through the leaked link but later purchased one from a friend. This year’s ticketing mishaps were not that “huge an anomaly,” he said.
“The bigger issue is probably communication. That’s always been a fraught process,” Peng said.
Yale junior Deniz Ince said she was ultimately able to get a ticket after opening the leaked link on an incognito tab. Some others — who were not so lucky — are now seeking tickets through different channels, according to Ince.
“I have heard of a lot of students just asking around just trying to see if anyone’s selling the tickets that they got,” Ince said. “I haven’t heard of any success stories yet.”

Law and public policy experts weighed potential reforms to the Supreme Court in a panel event at Harvard Law School on Wednesday.
Law School professor Stephen E. Sachs ’02 moderated the panel, which brought together professors from Yale Law School, Duke Law, the University of Virginia, the University of New South Wales Sydney, and the Harvard Kennedy School. The panel discussed the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States, which released its final report outlining proposed changes to the court in December 2021.
The panelists agreed that any reform should both insulate the justices from partisan politics and preserve the legitimacy of the court.
Neil S. Siegel, professor of law and political science at Duke Law, said the court’s legitimacy “always exists, or not, in the minds of an audience.” He added that justices should therefore strive to be “above reproach” and should recuse themselves from cases when necessary.
“I’d like to see the justices act more like judges,” Siegel said. “I’d like to see them act like their robes are black, and not blue or red.”
He stressed that the court has existed for centuries and will endure long after the current justices’ tenure.
“Sometimes I worry that at least some of the justices some of the time don’t really appreciate that,” he said.
Maya Sen, professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, said the Supreme Court no longer represents the average American, especially in light of the court’s recent swing to the right. Following the confirmation of three conservative justices in just four years under former President Donald Trump, the court reached its current 6-3 conservative majority.
“The Supreme Court’s really no longer in sync with the majority of Americans,” Sen said. “The court really is not representative of the average American, but is actually now currently much more representative of the average Republican Party voter.”
Sen pointed to the rushed confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett as a catalyst of the court’s politicization and the public’s disapproval of the court.
She said the misalignment of the public’s opinion with court rulings has contributed to calls for reforms to the court.
“The more that people see the court’s rulings in a way that’s opposed to their own views, sort of in conflict with their own views, the more likely they are to support things like terms limits and court expansion,” Sen said.
Still, the panelists highlighted the dangers of packing the court, with Siegel cautioning that court packing is “almost always a very bad idea.”
“It risks severely damaging, if not destroying, the court’s legitimacy,” he said. “I think it does raise the question of whether we want two branches of government or three.”
He suggested that a “piece of low hanging fruit” that could be implemented to improve the court is the adoption of an ethics code.
“It’s really not acceptable that they are the only federal judges to whom an ethics code does not apply,” Siegel said. “They should adopt it themselves, and they should try in good faith to comply with it.”
UNSW Sydney professor Rosalind Dixon warned that efforts to reform the court must ensure the public’s trust in the justices does not erode.
“We need to approach this with a view empowering democratic politics and encouraging a more responsive court,” Dixon said. “But not further alienating a conservative court into stepping away from its absolutely most fundamental function, which is to uphold the rule of law in a constitutional democracy.”

Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch discussed lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic regarding strategies for disease surveillance at a Harvard School of Public Health seminar on Wednesday.
Lipsitch, who has led the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since last year, reflected on strategies used by different countries to track the spread of Covid-19.
Lipsitch said most countries, except for Luxembourg and the United Kingdom, relied on case reporting as the “basic unit of surveillance” during the pandemic.
However, he noted that the number of reported cases is an “unreliable measure of disease activity” because people may not be incentivized to take a Covid test or report a positive result.
“This is a very strange kind of quantity to report, because it’s not an epidemiological quantity such as incidence or prevalence or duration,” he said. “But it’s a complex function of those quantities.”
Lipsitch instead praised the surveillance strategies used in Luxembourg and the U.K.
He said Luxembourg randomly sampled a “substantial fraction” of its “small population” each week to measure the spread of the virus. This strategy allowed Luxembourg to track the effectiveness of its countermeasures against Covid-19.
The U.K. used two surveillance methods early on in the pandemic, according to Lipsitch. One was repeated at different points during the pandemic, while the other tracked households over time.
Lipsitch said the methods used in Luxembourg and the U.K. are based on the belief that the “best way” to track infection in a country is to measure the spread in a random sample.
Lipsitch also highlighted the importance of data completeness. For instance, Lipsitch said the U.S. is missing data examining the race and ethnicity of those infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Still, there are ways to “squeeze” additional details from “the admittedly imperfect data that is gathered in a place that does not have random sampling,” according to Lipsitch.
Lipsitch said studies from the past year show that taking data from hospital populations can serve as a cheaper alternative to random sampling from the general population.
Lipsitch highlighted that seemingly constant factors — such as genetic sequence, illness severity, and contagiousness — can change over time as the virus mutates and the population develops resistance.
“What Covid has taught us is that actually all of these are surveillance questions,” he said. “All of them are changing through the pandemic.”

Following the 2022 midterm elections, Harvard Kennedy School political experts discussed what the results mean for polarization, voter turnout, and the future of the GOP at an Institute of Politics forum Wednesday night.
Moderated by Daniel J. Balz, a Washington Post chief correspondent and senior fellow at the IOP, the forum featured HKS affiliates Archon Fung, Cornell William Brooks, and Margaret E. Talev.
Brooks said high voter turnout in the midterm elections was “validation and affirmation of democracy.”
“In the face of widespread stoked cynicism and skepticism, people still showed up,” Brooks said.
Still, Fung said that while this year’s voter turnout was high for a midterm election, it was “pathetically low by international standards and the standards of good democracies.”
Talev, a CNN political analyst, said the country cannot “celebrate the resilience of democracy” with the continuing success of officials who question the legitimacy of the 2020 U.S. presidential election results.
“There are more elected representatives of Congress and state-level officials now elected who baselessly question the legitimate outcome of an election than ever before, and that’s a real problem,” she said.
Wednesday’s panel also touched on the recent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.
Brooks said politicians need to make clear that they stand against political violence.
“The fact that someone could attack the husband of the Speaker in their home and not have every member of Congress speak with a clear voice says two things — both they underestimated the threat, and they don’t appreciate the proximity of the threat,” Brooks said.
“In a democracy, political violence makes everyone vulnerable,” he added.
Talev discussed the implications of Tuesday’s midterm results for major players in the GOP.
“It was a bad night for Trump, a good night for DeSantis,” Talev said.
DeSantis won the Florida gubernatorial race by 19 points on Tuesday, garnering 58 percent of the Hispanic vote, and carrying Miami-Dade county, a traditionally Democratic stronghold. According to Talev, Florida’s race may indicate a shift in momentum within the Republican Party.
“I think we woke up this morning trying to understand how many national profile Republicans were going to take that moment as a window of opportunity and say, ‘It’s time for the country to move on,’ or ‘It’s time for us to get past Trump,’” Talev said.
She said a number of Trump-backed candidates lost at the polls in high-profile races, leaving many Republicans frustrated.
Talev also said it was “a bad night for Kevin McCarthy,” noting that even if he becomes House Speaker, he will be “completely hobbled” by the concessions he will have to make with a divided caucus.

If Republicans win control of the House, McCarthy would be leading it with a much smaller majority than expected. Talev said this will give President Biden “maneuvering room,” allowing him to prepare an agenda to appeal to centrists and “get ready for a reelection campaign.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ongoing renovations of Harvard’s Weld and Newell Boathouses along the Charles River have recently drawn scrutiny from an environmental group advocating for increased public access to the riverside docks.
The historic boathouses’ construction more than 100 years ago predated Massachusetts’ Public Waterfront Act — also known as Chapter 91 — which dictates that private constructions on the waterfront must “serve a proper public purpose.” The Charles River Watershed Association, a local non-profit environmental group, said Harvard must increase public benefit in its waterfront presence in light of its ongoing renovations.
Harvard began renovations this summer on the boathouses to modernize the buildings and increase accessibility, an undertaking which requires state approval to ensure Chapter 91 compliance.
Jennifer Ryan, deputy director of advocacy at CRWA, said it is unclear if the renovation project is currently in compliance with the public access requirements.
Harvard has released plans and proposals for both projects, but Ryan said the University “did not provide nearly enough detail on the issues around public access.”
“Harvard has not been forthcoming or transparent in their Chapter 91 due-diligence, and has restricted public access without compensation to the public for many years,” Ryan wrote in a follow-up emailed statement. “This is about upholding public rights.”
Ryan said Harvard should provide an evaluation of existing public access and a “feasibility study” to ensure a “full exploration of what is possible at those sites.”
In an October hearing, representatives from Harvard held that public access to the docks is not feasible, as they are currently accessible only via the private boathouses, the Boston Globe reported. The representatives added that keeping the docks private is necessary to protect boating equipment and ensure student safety.
Matthew J. Lyons ’26, a member of Harvard’s lightweight men’s crew team, said he agrees with Harvard’s justification for keeping the facilities private.
“I feel like there would actually be a pretty big safety hazard if it was open to the public,” Lyons said.
Lyons cited incidents during the Head of the Charles Regatta last month, where some rowers’ personal belongings went missing when the boathouse hosted other teams.
Ryan said there are solutions that can provide public access without sacrificing the safety of student rowers.
“We're not asking for the public to be able to go into the boathouses while the students are there,” Ryan said. “I think there’s a little bit of misconception around that.”
Harvard spokesperson Amy Kamosa wrote in an emailed statement that the University has proposed alternate plans which would provide public benefit while still keeping the boathouses private.
“The University’s renewal of the Weld and Newell Boathouses enables significant public realm upgrades, including improvements to the public pathway network and landscape features,” Kamosa wrote.
Kamosa added that Harvard has committed to supporting the development of a new dock on the Charles River. The proposed dock would be at Christian Herter Park, around a mile from the Newell Boathouse, and would be open to the public and high school rowing teams.
But Ryan said that there is not enough information about Harvard’s proposals to determine whether they are sufficient in providing public access.
“It is premature to opine on filings that we haven’t seen,” Ryan said of Harvard’s proposed support of the Christian Herter Park dock.
Other private entities whose facilities lie along the waterfront and do not allow for public access — like boat clubs or other universities’ docks — may have an interest in the outcome of CRWA’s advocacy.
A successful push from CRWA could set a precedent for forcing these groups to invest in greater public access to their property, like creating walkways or additional docks.
Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Edmund Coletta wrote in a statement that “these facilities are subject to licensing under Chapter 91” and that they “will continue to be reviewed under the current Waterways Regulation.”
Ryan said that Harvard should consider how to best support Cambridge beyond merely abiding with regulations.
“Harvard is leaning into a diversity, equity and inclusion paradigm and wants to find ways to be more creative and innovative in being a good partner,” Ryan said. “This is an opportunity.”

In 2016, Harvard had bad news to share in its annual financial report: Its endowment value had dropped nearly $2 billion. The report, released that November, detailed the endowment’s lackluster returns by disclosing how the Harvard Management Company performed in a variety of asset categories against internal and external benchmarks.
This year, the University disclosed similarly low returns, albeit in different market conditions. The endowment’s value dropped $2.3 billion after HMC delivered a 1.8 percent loss on its investments in fiscal year 2022.
But this fall, the financial report’s section on the endowment was missing a key ingredient from years past: underlying data.
Each fall, Harvard releases an annual financial report that provides insights into the University’s budget and investment strategy. The most anticipated figures in the report — annual endowment returns — come in a report from HMC’s CEO, which offers a rare glimpse into the investment approach of the largest university endowment in the country.
For years, the endowment section of the report looked largely the same, with data on HMC’s targets, as well as returns across asset categories such as domestic and foreign equities, private equities, and real estate.
But beginning in 2017, after N.P. “Narv” Narvekar took over as HMC’s CEO, the annual endowment reports began to change.
That year, the company stopped disclosing its internal benchmarks, which can be used to analyze the risk and return of a given investment portfolio. And this fall, it abandoned the longtime practice of disclosing investment performance by asset class.
Narvekar, who does not speak to the press, provided some written insights in a letter included in the financial report, which said fiscal year 2022 “was not a strong benchmark relative year” but the firm’s five-year performance “remains very strong” relative to its targets. The University’s financial report includes details on the asset allocation of all of Harvard’s investments, which encompass the endowment and other investments not managed by HMC.
But the changes have left Harvard stakeholders — including donors and alumni — without any underlying data to interpret the endowment’s performance, providing only topline numbers that can be difficult to evaluate on their own.
 
“Transparency goes to the heart of accountability for non-profit corporations, which don’t have the same types of governance controls that exist in the for-profit world,” New York University finance professor David L. Yermack ’85 wrote in an email. “It’s pretty rare to see a non-profit discontinue the disclosure of information that it has regularly released in the past, particularly in an area where it has struggled.”
In an interview earlier this month, Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow said HMC’s previous practice went beyond that of many peer institutions.
“We were reporting, for example, asset allocation and returns to different asset classes, when most of our peer institutions were not providing that level of detail in the reports,” he said. “So there are competitive reasons not to do it, candidly.”
Five of the eight Ivy League universities did not release their fiscal year 2021 endowment returns by asset class in their respective financial reports. Only Harvard, Brown, and Princeton included the data.
Bacow said decisions about what is disclosed in the financial report are made by HMC with the blessing of its board, which he sits on alongside an array of investors and financial experts.
“We’re not serving the institution well if the demands for transparency occur at the risk to any process,” Bacow said. “So we do disclose, but there’s always a judgment that’s made about whether the disclosure works to our benefit in enhancing our financial position or not.”
HMC has undergone a major overhaul since the arrival of Narvekar, who instituted a restructuring plan that shifted the vast majority of the endowment’s assets to external managers. HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan wrote that the shift toward external managers has made “simplified allocation reporting increasingly arbitrary.”
“Individual investments can straddle multiple asset classes and HMC wants to avoid reporting with false precision,” he wrote.
Narvekar’s restructuring was designed to revitalize HMC’s performance, which lagged severely in the years before he took over as CEO. Six years into his tenure, Harvard officials now say they are pleased with the company’s performance. In the school’s latest financial report, Harvard Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 and Vice President for Finance Thomas J. Hollister wrote that HMC “continues to wisely manage the endowment so that it can best provide steady and increasing distributions to the University’s budget into the future.”
Mitchell L. Dong ’75, managing director of the hedge fund Pythagoras Investments, said he does not believe HMC’s decision to release less data is “anything to be alarmed about.”
“I’m a hedge fund manager myself, and I write letters to my investors and also invest in other managers,” he said. “I read everybody’s letters and some people are very detailed, some people are less detailed — it just reflects somebody’s personality.”
Yermack, a former Crimson managing editor, said it is “not clear” how Harvard would be at a competitive disadvantage if HMC continued to disclose its investment performance by asset category.
“Everyone knows the benchmark returns in these asset classes,” he wrote, “and keeping the information secret from Harvard’s own alumni looks an awful lot like an attempt to deflect questions about performance.”

Massachusetts voters narrowly approved ballot questions that will substantially raise taxes on millionaires and legalize driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants in the midterm elections on Tuesday.
Residents voted 52 percent to 48 to approve Ballot Question One, which will amend the state constitution to raise income taxes by 4 percent on annual incomes above $1 million. The tax will apply to 0.6 percent of households in the state, according to the Center for State Policy Analysis at Tufts University, and it is expected to raise about $1.3 billion in state revenue in 2023.
Jeron Mariani, who managed the Fair Share for Massachusetts campaign — a coalition including dozens of labor unions and advocacy groups — wrote in a statement that the vote was a “once-in-a-generation opportunity that was years in the making.”
“Our coalition will stick together to ensure that the money from Question 1 reaches our public school classrooms and college campuses, and our roads, bridges, and transit systems,” Mariani wrote. “We’ll keep working to build a Massachusetts economy that works well for everyone, not just those at the top.”
The Coalition to Stop the Tax Hike Amendment wrote it was “disappointed” by the passage of Ballot Question One, calling it a “setback for the Massachusetts economy.”
“There is no guarantee that this ill-conceived amendment will increase spending for either education nor transportation. It will, however, severely impact retirees, homeowners, and hardworking residents across the state,” the Coalition wrote. “This amendment will hurt small businesses as they struggle with inflation, supply chain issues, and work to rebuild from the negative impacts of the pandemic.”
Voters also approved Ballot Question Four 54 percent to 46, ratifying a law passed by the state legislature in May allowing Massachusetts residents who cannot prove legal residency to get driver’s licenses. The result comes as a victory for advocates who have pushed for years to pass the law.
The group Safer Roads Massachusetts, which campaigned in favor of the ballot question, wrote in a tweet that the victory meant “safer roads and increased mobility access for everyone in our state, regardless of status.”
Voters resoundingly approved Ballot Question Two, in a 71 percent to 29 vote, which will force dental insurance providers to allocate at least 83 percent of premiums toward patient care. It brings regulations on dental insurance providers in line with other health care insurers, which are obliged to spend between 85 and 88 percent of their premiums on patients per Massachusetts law.
In a statement to supporters Tuesday night, American Dental Association president George R. Shepley said the vote “set the stage for the rest of the country.”
“You all are just setting a shining example of where we can go in our future endeavors in dental insurance reform and what we can do to help our patients,” Shepley said.
Voters rejected Ballot Question Three, which would have overhauled the state’s alcohol licensing rules, 55 percent to 45 percent.

Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams will step down at the end of the academic year after seven years in office, she announced Thursday.
Williams was the first Black dean of a Harvard school’s faculty and HSPH’s first female dean. Prior to assuming the role of dean, she served as chair of the school’s Department of Epidemiology and conducted research on child and maternal health.
“I have decided it is time for me to take the advice that we in public health so often dispense and step back to reflect, recharge, and return to activities that hold deep meaning for me,” Williams wrote in an announcement to School of Public Health affiliates Thursday.
Williams oversaw a period of turmoil at HSPH, with high leadership turnover during her time as dean. Affiliates of the school told The Crimson that she and her deputy created a toxic culture, and faculty at the school weighed a rare vote of no confidence against her in 2018.
Williams is the second dean of a Harvard school to announce their departure in recent weeks after longtime Harvard Divinity School Dean David N. Hempton said last month he would step down on the same timeline. University President Lawrence S. Bacow is also set to step down in June 2023.
During her tenure, HSPH launched collaborations with other Harvard schools, organizations, and academic institutions abroad — including the Harvard Global Nursing Leadership Program and a collaboration with the Tsinghua University’s Vanke School of Public Health in Beijing.
HSPH also collaborated with the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and Apple to launch the Apple Women’s Health Study, which aimed to eliminate stigma around the menstrual cycle.
Under Williams’ leadership, HSPH also hired its first chief diversity, inclusion, and belonging officer in June 2020.
Williams also led the school’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2021, she co-founded the COVID Collaborative — a group of health experts, economic leaders, and educators brought together to help coordinate local and national responses to the pandemic.
“Under Michelle’s leadership during the historic public health crisis posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, faculty proved themselves to be an invaluable resource to governments and the public at large,” Bacow wrote in a message to HSPH affiliates Thursday.
Williams will resume teaching and research as part of the HSPH faculty after a sabbatical year.
“Looking back, I see a kaleidoscope of memories. The COVID pandemic, of course, looms above all,” Williams said. “I will always be proud of how our community mobilized to meet the moment, producing research and guidance that saved countless lives and shifting our vital educational programs online without missing a beat.”
Bacow said University leadership will soon launch a search for Williams’ successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just over a week, Cambridge will light up with the energy of thousands of fans as the 138th Playing of The Game comes to Harvard Stadium. But despite students preparing to host their Yale counterparts and the campus starting to get ready for the festivities, the Harvard football team (5-3, 3-2) is focused on another mission: keeping its slim Ivy League championship hopes alive on a Saturday trip to the City of Brotherly Love. In its first trip to Philadelphia since 2018, the Crimson will face off against a much-improved Penn squad (7-1, 4-1), needing two wins and two Princeton losses to share a conference championship with the Tigers. Harvard and the Quakers will kick off at 1 p.m. at Franklin Field.
“Harvard-Yale is a really, really special week here,” senior offensive lineman Scott Elliott said. “But like I said, Penn’s defense is extremely talented.”
The Quakers defense played a major role in its 28-21 victory last weekend over Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y., intercepting Big Red signal-caller Jameson Wang twice and sacking him thrice. The unit covered up for a relatively shaky performance by sophomore quarterback Aidan Sayin, who completed just eight of his 18 passes for 137 yards, two touchdowns and a pick. Holding a two-touchdown fourth quarter lead and with Cornell operating a four-down offense, the Penn defense pulled together three consecutive fourth down stops to thwart the Big Red’s hopes at a comeback. By the time Wang finally broke through with a nine-yard touchdown pass to wideout Thomas Glover, the win had already been sealed.
Meanwhile, the Crimson lost a gut-wrenching, nerve-racking battle against previously winless Columbia last Saturday. The Lions blocked three of senior kicker Jonah Lipel’s field goal attempts in a 21-20 victory, the latter a 42-yard attempt that grazed a Columbia defender’s fingertips before clanking into the left upright and falling harmlessly to the turf. In his return from an injury that held him out of the 28-13 victory over Dartmouth on Oct. 29, senior quarterback Charlie Dean was solid, completing 17 of his 29 passes for 220 yards, one touchdown, and one interception – which came on a tipped ball.
In last year’s 23-7 win at Harvard Stadium, senior running back Aidan Borguet played a limited role as the backup to star Aaron Shampklin ’22, carrying the ball eight times for 29 yards. But with Shampklin having graduated – he spent training camp with the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys – Borguet is the feature back of the Harvard offense and is a front-runner for Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year. Last Saturday, as part of a 23-carry, 108-yard, one-touchdown performance, he crossed the 1,000-yard plateau for the season, becoming the eighth Crimson back ever to hit that mark. With 299 yards in his final two games, he could surpass Clifton Dawson ’07 as the single-season rushing leader in Harvard history.
“It’s really fun to work with [Borguet]. That guy does not go down with the first hit,” Elliott said. “He makes it easy on us. He kind of sets up linebackers to make the double teams a little bit easier, and this offensive line has gelled week in and week out. Our communication is top notch, and everyone feels extremely confident lining up against anybody.”
But Borguet cannot do it alone against a Quakers defense that has allowed merely 86.6 yards per game on the ground, a rate which ties for sixth in the nation, a few yards better than the Crimson’s seventh-placed unit. He will have backfield help in senior running back Sone Ntoh, who is from Macungie, Pa., an hour’s drive from Philadelphia. Additionally, Dean’s arsenal appears as if it will be more fully stocked on Saturday. Despite Kym Wimberly missing the Columbia contest with a left ankle injury, head coach Tim Murphy had expressed confidence that his star senior wide receiver would not be out for the rest of the season. Also, sophomore wide receiver Ledger Hatch, who also sat out against Columbia, practiced on Wednesday. In their absence, Dean leaned heavily on first-year receiver Cooper Barkate, who hit the century mark with 102 receiving yards and could factor into offensive coordinator Mickey Fein’s plans on Saturday. Junior tight end Tyler Neville will likely also see significant attention in the passing game against Penn.
Harvard fans can expect Dean to air the ball out frequently in order to dissect the Quakers’ defense, which pairs an elite rushing unit with middle-of-the-pack aerial coverage. The Penn secondary allows 221 yards per game, which ranks 61st in the nation. While the Quakers boast returning players like senior defensive back Jaden Key, who recorded four pass breakups against the Crimson last November, and senior linebacker Jonathan Melvin, who had 2.5 tackles for a loss, the keys to victory for Penn work out of the three-point stance. The elite Quakers defensive line has notched 29 sacks so far this season, good for third-best in the nation. Interior defensive linemen Noah Slackman and Micah Morris have made major strides this year, racking up 4.5 and 2.5 sacks, respectively. They are joined on the outside by Jake Heimlicher, whose seven sacks rank first in the Ivy League. Penn’s front four will be the biggest challenge that Harvard’s eighth-ranked offensive line has faced this season. However, Elliott expressed confidence that his unit was up to the task.
“They blitzed us a lot last year. We expect the same from them this year,” he explained. “A lot of twist games and everything like that, so we just have to be able to get our hips under us, be able to land our hands, and just communicate with all the twists and all the pressure.”
Another key for the Crimson will be converting on third downs, an area where the offense has struggled this season. In the loss to Columbia, Dean’s offense earned a fresh set of downs just twice in 13 opportunities, continuing a season-long trend of dismal performances in clutch situations. After being an elite third-down team on both sides of the ball in 2021, Harvard ranks just 77th on offense, converting 36.5 percent of its tries, and 71st on defense, allowing opposing units to pass the line to gain 41.8 percent of the time. The Crimson’s relative ineptitude on third down has led to it controlling the ball for just 29 minutes each game, which ranks 76th in the Football Championship Series (FCS). Meanwhile, the Quakers allow conversions on just 34.2 percent of opportunities, the third-stingiest rate in the Ivy League.
“We definitely have to do a better job than we did last week,” Elliott said. “We have to be extremely, extremely good on first down, getting at least four, getting half on second down, and we talk about it in all of our unit meetings before Friday, just bucking up and trying to get in those third-and-short, third-and-medium situations.”
The Crimson’s chances will hinge on the defense as well. After bringing down Jack Zergiotis nine times in the season-opening, 28-21 win over Merrimack, Harvard’s defensive line has slowed down its pace, adding 16 sacks in the seven games since. Senior defensive lineman Nate Leskovec has not taken down the quarterback behind the line since his 4.5-sack performance in the season opener, which earned him FCS Defensive Player of the Week. However, with playmakers like Leskovec, junior defensive tackle Thor Griffith, and senior defensive lineman and captain Truman Jones, the Crimson still presents a challenge for opposing offenses. The secondary appeared to hit its stride in the third quarter of the Lions contest, too, intercepting Caden Bell three times in the frame. The takeaways were just the team’s fifth, sixth, and seventh of the season, but on Saturday, it will hope for better results against Sayin, who it intercepted three times in last year’s win.
“I thought we did a good job forcing some turnovers,” said senior defensive back James Herring on positive takeaways from the defense’s performance in the loss to Columbia. “We had a handful of takeaways. I was pretty proud of how we played for most of the game.”
The Penn signal-caller has improved tremendously since the last time Harvard fans saw him. After tossing seven picks in his five starts last season, Sayin has given the ball away just six times in the first eight games of his sophomore campaign. Overall, he has completed more than 62 percent of his passes for 1,871 yards and 15 touchdowns, adding two more scores on the ground. He is buoyed on offense by running back Trey Flowers, who has turned his 94 carries into 460 yards and seven touchdowns on the ground. Given the Crimson’s strong rushing defense, Sayin will likely take to the air frequently on Saturday, meaning the Quakers’ impressive slate of playmakers in the receiving game will play a major factor in the game. Junior wide receiver Joshua Casilli has been Sayin’s top target so far this year, hauling in 48 passes for 461 yards and four touchdowns. He is supplemented by senior Rory Starkey, Jr., who has added 36 catches, 303 yards, and three scores. Last year at Harvard Stadium, Starkey caught seven passes for 61 yards. Reining in Casilli and Starkey on Saturday will be pivotal for a defense that allowed Holy Cross receiver Jalen Coker and Princeton’s Andrei Iosivas to put up 164 and 176 yards, respectively.
“He’s taken strides,” Herring said of Sayin. “He’s really improving as a Division I quarterback. I have respect for him.”
With the four best teams in the Ancient Eight battling each other in the final two weeks of the season - in addition to Harvard’s contest against 4-1 Yale on Nov. 19, the Tigers will take on Yale on Saturday before concluding its season against Penn – the end of the 2022 campaign will be nothing if not dramatic. For the Crimson, Saturday’s game will mean everything. Not only would Harvard record its first undefeated season on the road since 2015, a win might keep it in contention for a conference title, depending on Princeton’s result in New Haven, Conn.
Harvard fans can catch the contest live on ESPN+ or over the radio at WRCA (1330 AM, 106.1 FM, 92.9 FM-HD2).
