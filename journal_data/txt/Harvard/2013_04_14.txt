After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twice during his performance in Tercentenary Theater Saturday evening, rapper Tyga alluded to the controversy surrounding his appearance at Yardfest.
“Despite all the haters, we’re here,” he yelled into his microphone just minutes into his performance, saying he appreciated everyone who came out for the concert.
Later, not long before leaving the stage at the end of the night, he shouted, “I just want to say: Fuck the haters.”
Tyga, whose selection as the Yardfest headliner generated student protest, a reaction from the Office of Student Life, and even an alternate concert, appeared otherwise unfazed throughout his nearly hour-long performance. Wearing a hoodie, baseball cap, and sunglasses, Tyga rapped before a crowd that attendees characterized as larger than last year’s concert but still not well-attended.
At one point, Tyga performed “Bitch Betta Have My Money”—a song with lyrics that a student-launched Change.org petition criticized as “explicitly and violently misogynistic.”
Following the student outcry and a request from OSL administrators to reconsider the selection of Tyga, the College Events Board and the Harvard College Concert Commission, which organized the annual spring concert, announced last Monday that they would delay the start time of Tyga’s performance to allow unhappy students to leave the concert after eating dinner and watching student openers Puttanesca and The Cantab Cowboys.
But despite the controversy and chilly weather, the crowd did not thin noticeably after Tyga came on stage. Several students who attended praised the performance.
“I am enjoying it,” said Hillary L. Crowe ’15 as she stood listening to the music, lounging against a tree in the Yard. “I think it’s a fun way to hang out with friends.”
Still, some students left the concert before Tyga’s performance began. Anahvia T. Mewborn ’16 walked out of the performance before it ended, saying she was leaving in protest of Tyga.
Before Tyga took the stage at about 7:15 p.m., the two student groups performed as students ate a barbecue-style dinner in the Yard.
At 5:15 p.m., Puttanesca, an 11-piece ensemble featuring a harp and flute among other instruments, opened Yardfest with a cover of Coldplay’s “Paradise.”
Kate P. Donahue ’16, who had several friends in the group, said she appreciated the variety of instruments that Puttanesca brought to the concert.
“It feels like such a Harvard band to me,” Donahue said in the crowd as Nina L. Hooper ’16 sang Puttanesca’s cover of Miley Cyrus’s hit “Party in the U.S.A.”
Next, four-student band The Cantab Cowboys came on stage to perform new and old hits. Before hosting an alternative concert planned for later that evening in the Eliot House courtyard, the Eliot House Masters Gail A. O’Keefe and Douglas A. Melton made an appearance for The Cantab Cowboys’ performance. O’Keefe called the band “amazing,” noting that band member Axel K. Snow ’15 is an Eliot resident.
For many, the tumultuous lead-up to the concert culminated in a relatively smooth Yardfest.
“I think overall people who were here had a good time,” said Rebecca L. Grzyb ’16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small but supportive crowd came out to see local hip hop and soul artist Shea Rose perform at a concert in the Eliot House courtyard Saturday night that began at the same time rapper Tyga took the stage at Yardfest in Tercentenary Theater.
The Eliot House concert was intended to provide an alternative for students who did not want to see Tyga, whose selection as headliner for the annual spring concert generated outcry among students who complained that the rapper’s song lyrics are sexist.
At one point during her approximately 90-minute performance, Rose dedicated a song—entitled “‘S’ on My Chest” in a reference to the Superman symbol—to “all the ladies in the audience.” Other songs included “Rock ’n Rose,” “Get Up,” and “Free Love.”
The alternative concert began at 6 p.m., and most concertgoers started to arrive around 6:30 p.m. Police officers checked IDs at the entrance to the Eliot courtyard, and a DJ played music until Rose’s concert began at around 7:15 p.m. Fewer than 50 people were in attendence for the start of her performance, though more arrived throught the evening, especially after Yardfest ended. Attendees estimated that the event ultimately drew fewer than 150 people.
Some students were disappointed by the sparse attendance at the concert, though most said they were impressed by Rose’s performance.
Diane X. Yang ’16 said she expected more people to demonstrate their opposition to Tyga by attending the concert in Eliot House.
“I’m kind of disappointed that all the people who signed the petition were only paying lip service,” Yang said.
Yang decided not to watch Tyga perform, but said it was because she does not like his music, not because she was protesting his performance.
Most attendees said that they went to the event for the music, rather than as an active protest against Tyga’s music.
“It’s really exciting to see a young, up-and-coming hip-hop artist,” said attendee Alexander A. Morelli ’13. “Tyga I could listen to any day in my room.”
Eliot House Master Douglas A. Melton said that students generally seemed supportive of the event.
“Many students said that they are grateful for the alternate concert,” he said.
The alternative concert was funded by the Office of the Dean of the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After ceding the Class of 1975 Cup to Princeton for the last five years, the Radcliffe heavyweight first varsity eight boat was ready for a change.
On Saturday morning, the Black and White’s top boat outpaced the Tigers on Cayuga Inlet in Ithaca, N.Y. to take back the Cup for the first time since 2007.
“Our goal for this race was to really race the middle thousand meters, so from 500 we took a move and hit this really great rhythm that was really powerful, and I really think that we achieved that goal,” said senior Mary Maginnis, rowing in the second seat of the first varsity eight.
“They definitely pushed us toward the end, which was fun, but we definitely did exactly what we wanted to do: have a strong base, have a powerful middle 1000. We wanted to win the race, and that’s exactly what we did.”
The Class of 1975 Cup races, which encompasses six different competitions, features Radcliffe against Ivy-foes Princeton and Cornell.
The Tigers and the Black and White exchanged victories throughout the day, with Radcliffe taking home wins in two of the three NCAA qualifying events—the first varsity eights race and the varsity fours race.
“This is always a big race because both Princeton and Cornell can be quite fast,” Radcliffe coach Liz O’Leary said. “Cornell is a little off their normal speed this year, from what we’ve seen this far…but Princeton was very much on. They’ve had some fast races so far this year, so we knew it was going to be a very competitive weekend, and it was.”
After last weekend’s gusty headwinds and churning currents in the Charles River, the relatively calm weather on the Cayuga Inlet provided much appreciated rowing conditions for the crews.
“The Cornell racecourse is in sort of a canal, so it’s very protected from all directions,” O’Leary said. “There was sort of a tailwind today, which meant we were racing with the wind rather than against the wind, which was a nice change, given that last weekend we were racing sort of into heavy headwind conditions.”
The course, which featured just three lanes, allowed crews to race right up next to each other.
Added with the format of the spring racing, where crews compete at the same time rather than in a timed trial, the regatta provided an elevated competitive atmosphere.
“It makes it that much more competitive, that much more fun, that much more exciting,” Maginnis said. “Obviously, racing you get really nervous, but it’s always fun to cross the finish line and know exactly how you did, rather than in a head race, you cross the finish line and you think, ‘Oh, that felt good,’ but it didn’t end up that good based on the results. I love it. It’s my favorite kind of racing.”
Beginning the day for the Black and White was the third varsity eight, which rowed to a second-place finish, completing the 2000-meter course in 6:49.9, eight seconds behind the Tiger’s crew.
The first varsity eight took to the water next and pushed through the middle 1000 of the race to best Princeton by 2.2 seconds with a final time of 6:11.7.
O’Leary attributes the crew’s success to the boat’s base speed—the stretch following the initial sprint.
“[The first varsity eight] was our first win [of the day], and they had a really strong base speed, which is I think what is at the root of a successful team,” O’Leary said. “If your base speed is good, then you can build off of that. Today was the first time that I had sort of seen them race aggressively at base and that was encouraging.”
The varsity fours crew employed a similar strategy to pull out its own victory, making a surge in the middle 1000 meters to cross the finish line nearly five seconds ahead of the Tigers’ boat.
The second varsity eight represented Radcliffe’s only loss in an NCAA qualifying event on the day.
The crew, which finished in 6:23.4, found itself five seconds behind Princeton.
Finishing out the day for the Black and White were the second varsity fours crew and the fourth varsity eights, which finished second and third, respectively, while the Tigers reigned victorious.
For O’Leary, the victories are an indicator not just of the progress that her team has made thus far, but of the work remaining in the spring season.
“To win two of those events today was an important step for us,” O’Leary said. “I know that school is winding down, but for us the season is just winding up, so this is a good start, but it’s just one race.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It proved to be a successful weekend for the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crews, who each toppled opponents to extend undefeated spring seasons.  The No. 4 heavyweights defeated No. 3 Brown on Saturday at home on the Charles River.  The No. 1 lightweights displayed their dominance by sweeping all four races against Dartmouth and MIT.
HEAVYWEIGHTS
The Crimson heavyweights captured the Stein Cup on Saturday, taking three of five races against the Bears.  The win marked Harvard’s third-straight Stein Cup victory and 40th win overall in the race’s history.  Despite the cold weather, racing conditions were calm and flat on the Charles River.
The first varsity event presented a tight race between the Crimson and Brown crews.  Harvard took a slight lead around the 1,000-meter mark, but the Bears stayed strong and sprinted to the finish.  The Crimson ultimately held on and finished in 5:53.6, defeating Brown by a margin of 1.1 seconds.
Harvard posted an additional win in the second varsity race.  The race was similarly close until the finish.
“Brown was making moves and we were countering them,” said junior William Hakim, coxswain of the second varsity boat.
The Crimson took the lead at the end of the course to post a time of 6:03.9, beating the Bears by 2.5 seconds.  Harvard also recorded a victory in the fourth varsity race, finishing in 6:29.4 to defeat Brown with an open-water lead.  The third varsity and freshman eight races fell to the Bears in two tight finishes.  These races were the closest of the morning, both decided by less than a second.
“It’s great to start our season off well,” Hakim said. “But Brown is a crew that gets faster and faster over the course of the season, so the goal is to keep improving.”
LIGHTWEIGHTS
The Crimson lightweights traveled to Hanover, NH on Saturday to take on the Big Green and the Engineers for the Biglin Bowl. Harvard’s record at Dartmouth has been strong, as the crews’ success this weekend allowed the crew to capture the Bowl for the 50th time in its 59-year history.
“Yesterday was our best race of the year so far,” said senior Matt O’Leary, second seat of the first varsity boat. “It was a good turn-around from last weekend where we were average and weren’t quite as cohesive as we wanted to be.”
Saturday’s conditions were near-perfect, with little wind and calm water. The first varsity match-up started off as a tight race between Harvard, the Big Green, and MIT.
“In the 1V race, in the first minute or so all three boats were even,” O’Leary said. “MIT was actually in the lead by a little bit.  About 500 meters in, we started to move away and got about a length up on Dartmouth and about a little over a length on MIT for the second half of the race. That’s when MIT faded back.”
The Crimson first varsity boat finished in 5:42.2, 3.9 seconds ahead of Dartmouth and 12.3 seconds ahead of the Engineers.  The Harvard freshman boat also won its race, clocking a 3.6-second win over the Big Green boat.
The second and third varsity boats also posted decisive open-water victories over their challengers.  The Crimson second varsity completed the race in 5:48.1, defeating MIT by a margin of 8.6 seconds and Dartmouth by 15.3 seconds.  The third varsity boat finished in 6:02.7, significantly ahead of its opponents.
Despite Harvard’s success this year, the Crimson rowers remain focused on improvement and consistency.
“The goal of the season isn’t to win the early races, it’s to win the last races,” O’Leary said.  “But, these are all teams we are going to be seeing in the IRA Championship and Sprints.  It’s good to beat these teams, but we’ve got our eyes focused [forward].”
The lightweights face Navy at home on the Charles River next weekend.  Overall, the team stated that the positive results of the weekend will give them good momentum heading into the rest of the season.
“It was great because all [Harvard] boats won,” O’Leary said. “It was a good team-wide confidence booster and we are pretty happy with the results.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first weekend of postseason play, the Harvard women’s water polo team entered seeded as the third seed and finished in that same spot.
Competing at the CWPA Southern Division Championships in Providence, the Crimson (16-14, 3-3 CWPA) defeated Mercyhurst but then fell by four goals to Brown in the nightcap.
Harvard secured third place by beating George Washington Sunday morning, 15-11.
“We got our [fifteenth and sixteenth] wins of the year, so I’m happy with that,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “I would’ve liked to be playing in the championship game instead of playing and winning third. But we played a tough Brown team last night and came up short.”
HARVARD 15, GEORGE WASHINGTON 11
The Crimson offense jumped out to an early lead and never looked back against the Colonials (14-14), riding consistent scoring to a four-goal victory in the tournament’s third place game.
Five Harvard players scored multiple goals. Junior attacker Shayna Price found the back of the net four times to lead the attack, and sophomore attacker Victoria Frager contributed a team-high three assists.
“We were pressing super hard,” freshman attacker Yoshi Andersen said. “It really started on the defensive end, and I think everybody stepped it up. We were talking a lot more, and I feel like that’s what helped us.”
The Crimson took control of the game early. Fueled by two goals from Price, Harvard scored five times in the first period of play to GW’s one.
While the two teams played an even second period, the Crimson outscored the Colonials by two goals in the third to make the score 12-6. Although GW attempted to mount an attack in the closing minutes, the deficit ultimately would prove too large to overcome.
The win marked the second time this season Harvard defeated the Colonials, with the first coming as a six-goal decision just eight days earlier.
BROWN 16, HARVARD 12
In the final game of pool play, the Crimson needed a win to advance to the championship game the next day. But the Bears (15-19) were up for the challenge, and Harvard could not pull out the win, falling by four goals.
Both teams battled to a stalemate in the first three periods of play. Although Brown posted six goals in the first frame, the Crimson stayed in the game with four goals of its own.
After Harvard outscored the Bears by one in the second period and each squad totaled five goals in the third, the game was shaping up to go down to the wire.
Although the Crimson found itself within one goal at the start of the fourth quarter, Brown’s defense took control of the game and shut Harvard out in the period. The Bears would go on to score three goals to secure the 16-12 win.
“I think two or three times we came back from three goals down,” Minnis said. “You exert a lot of energy when you’re trying to come back, and we just couldn’t get over the hump and we ran out of gas. Brown did a good job, they played real well, and they had a little bit more gas in the tank in the end.”
Co-captain Aisha Price was the high-scorer for the Crimson with four goals on the game. Sophomore Ariel Dukes posted a team-high five steals and led the way for Harvard with four saves in goal.
With the win, the Bears advanced to the championship, but would go on to lose to No. 12 Princeton, 12-4.
HARVARD 17, MERCYHURST 8
In its first game of the tournament, the Crimson dismantled the Lakers (13-13) from start to finish, cruising to a nine-goal victory.
Although Harvard had already defeated Mercyhurst, 11-3, earlier this season, the team did not take its opponent lightly in the second showdown.
Andersen led the way for the Crimson with five goals, three assists, and four steals. Shayna Price scored four times, and Aisha Price and freshman Charlotte Hendrix both found the back of the net more than once.
Although Harvard held the lead the entire game, the team was up only 6-3 after two periods. But the Crimson offense came to life in the second half, scoring six goals in the third and five more in the fourth to pull away from the Lakers.
The game was a complete team effort for Harvard, as seven different players found the back of the cage and ten people registered at least one assist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After opening with a fifth-place start, the Harvard men’s golf team was unable to improve on its first round and finished sixth out of 14 teams with 885 total strokes at the Princeton Invitational at Springdale Golf Course this weekend.
While the Crimson led Yale by two strokes after the first round on the par-71 course, the Bulldogs had three golfers at-or-under par in the second round for a six-under total score, a comeback that allowed the team to win the tournament for the third year in a row with 868 strokes.
“Yale obviously had an amazing second round,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “They had everything go their way and they obviously like it [at Princeton]…. A couple things didn’t go our way, and we didn’t react as well as we could have.”
The Invitational was unique in that the first and second rounds were played all in one day, rather than spread out over two, and created the challenge for each golfer of playing 36 holes in one day.
“We were generally pretty pleased with how we played,” captain Theodore Lederhausen said. “We stumbled a little bit in the second round yesterday after a long day. Overall, we were doing everything we [could], and we look forward to Ivies.”
The duo of Brandon Matthews and Matthew Teesdale from Temple University tied for the individual title, shooting four-under over three rounds for a score of 209. Bulldog Brad Kushner rounded out the podium at two-under with the only other performance under par, while his teammate Sam Bernstein trailed him by just three strokes.
A somewhat difficult course consistently caused troubles for the Harvard golfers.
“The biggest challenges came on the putting green,” Rhoads said. “The greens are very sloped there, and the holes are in tricky positions.”
Lederhausen posted the sole top-ten finish for Harvard, tying for seventh place with 217 strokes, four above par. Lederhausen began the tournament the same way he did last weekend in Phoenix, shooting even par to put him in fifth place.
“[Theo’s] game is nicely rounding into form,” Rhoads said. “He looks a little more confident every day. He’s hitting better every day. That’s why he had a very solid tournament.”
The junior had a tougher time in the second round, shooting six-over on the front nine but closing the gap to five above par by the end of the round. His four birdies on the final day of the tournament helped him card a third round score of 70.
“Overall, it felt really good,” Lederhausen said. “It was a good tournament, and I was happy with how I played all weekend. I got a little tired at the end of the first day, as I hadn’t played 36 holes in a while.”
Junior Michael Lai turned in the second best result for the Crimson, with the only other top-20 finish, hitting eight above par for the weekend.
Two strong rounds allowed Lai to enter the second day of competition just two strokes above par, but three double bogeys in the final round set him back six strokes.
“Michael started a little bit higher today, but his first two rounds were very good,” Rhoads said. “He didn’t putt quite as well today, but he’s also rounding into form very well. The putter got a little bit cold today.”
The remaining three golfers finished within nine strokes of Lai. Freshman Rohan Ramnath and sophomore Akash Mirchandani tied for 24th place, both with a score of 224, while freshman Un Cho rounded out the group with 230 shots in 43rd place.
“I’m very happy with how they played and what they’ve been doing,” Lederhausen said. “Rohan’s been great. Both freshmen worked super hard this winter and definitely improved their play this spring. It’s a small team, and so we need every player. I’m confident in them, as with everyone.”
Harvard’s sixth-place finish placed the squad fifth of the eight Ivy League teams competing. The team will receive a weekend off before its season-ending league championship tournament.
“I like the direction things are going, and we’re trending in a good way, so we need to build on that the next few weeks going into Ivies,” Rhoads said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team exorcised some demons in two consecutive wins over Yale on Sunday afternoon, completing a four-game weekend sweep of the Bulldogs.
The young team has struggled this season with recovering from defensive and pitching mistakes, while consistently stringing together hits in the clutch.
Not this time.
On senior day at Soldiers Field, the Crimson (16-17, 8-4 Ivy) won both games on walk-off hits—the first called after the 5th because of the mercy rule—beating Yale (8-26, 3-9), 12-3 and 5-3.
Sophomore first baseman Adrienne Hume came up big in the first game, slapping a two-run double into the right-center gap to walk-off in the fifth. After Yale tied it up in the top of the ninth during the second game, junior third baseman Kasey Lange responded with a one-out, two-run jack to end the game.
“Kasey Lange is a boss at life,” sophomore shortstop Emily Gusse said. “That’s all you need to say. Write that down.”
Though Harvard was missing freshman pitcher Morgan Groom, who sat due to illness after pitching a complete game the day before, freshman Jamie Halula and sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz combined to hold the Bulldogs to five earned runs on 12 hits and six walks.
With the wins, the Crimson extended its winning streak to six and remains tied with Dartmouth for first place in the North Division with eight conference games to play.
“In this conference, anything can happen,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We [knew] at the beginning of the season that we were graduating a lot of good players, and we’re in the mix. At this point in the year to still have a shot is great.”
HARVARD 5, YALE 3
After scoring three runs on small-ball plays in the second, fourth and sixth innings, it looked like the Crimson would walk away with its second easy win of the day.
But Yale stuck with Harvard, and its payoff came in the top of the seventh when starting pitcher Ruiz began to struggle with her control.
Freshman left fielder Allie Souza led-off the inning with a liner above Lange’s reach at third, and advanced to second when freshman shortstop Brittany Labbadia drew a walk. Sophomore catcher Sarah Onorato made the first out of the inning, a hard-hit liner speared by Hume at first.
After Ruiz gave up a bloop single to right field, Halula—who was credited with the win—came in to relieve the sophomore and gave up a sacrifice groundball and a single, which brought the score to a tie going into the bottom of the inning.
But the Crimson would come out on top, as junior co-captain and right fielder Shelbi Olson reached on a single up the middle and stole second, setting the stage for Lange’s walk-off.
“We’ve been waiting for one of those for her,” Allard said. “We were just trying to get Kasey to connect with the ball, and I was surprised they pitched to her. They had handled her earlier in other at bats, but she just did a great job.”
HARVARD 12, YALE 3
Harvard overcame a tough break at the beginning of the game but responded with a run in the bottom of the first and three in the second to take the lead.
Onorato led off with a long fly ball into the right center gap. She stretched it into a triple when freshman center fielder Zoe Galindo booted the ball. Onorato came home when sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz bobbled the ball on the cutoff.
Halula gave up her second consecutive hit to the same spot, but heads up fielding by Galindo held junior center fielder Tori Balta to a single, and Halula shut down the Bulldogs’ threat with two fly-outs and a groundball to Gusse.
In the top of the third, senior second baseman Jennifer Ong grounded to Gusse, who was bowled over by sophomore right fielder Riley Hughes charging from second. Though the runner was called for the final out of the inning on the interference, Gusse stayed down for several minutes.
But the shortstop was able to walk it off and she started the next inning with a slow chopper over starting pitcher Chelsea Dunham’s head, beating out the throw for a single. Gusse’s bat and defense would prove crucial for the rest of the game.
“Oh you know, I’m feeling old,” Gusse said about her collision. “You do what you need to do. I got the out, so that’s what matters.”
Up 4-3 going into the bottom of the fifth, Harvard batted through the order and scored eight runs to end the game. Gusse and Lange both had RBI doubles, and freshman left fielder Haley Davis—batting cleanup in place of sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte, who was out with injury—drew a walk.
“Haley has a great mindset for cleanup,” Allard said. “She has a lot of patience, and she seeks good pitches. She’s been doing well in that spot.”
With Hume’s walk-off double, the Crimson hit .444 in the game and .392 for the day, capping off an eight-game conference homestand.

In this special edition of "Listen Up!"—Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop—we bring you one expert's perspective on SWUGs, straight from the trenches.
Recently, Raisa Bruner, a girl I really should be friends with, wrote an article in the Yale Daily News's Weekend Magazine about SWUGs, or Senior Washed Up Girls. The piece was picked up by New York Magazine (jealous). And then Gawker picked up the story by New York Magazine (super jealous). The Atlantic Wire, Jezebel, and others have also gotten in on the SWUG action.
SWUG is a term commonly used at Yale, but definitions both within Yale and in the media have varied widely. Some describe a SWUG as the girl who is on a first name basis with a few too many bartenders and frat members. Others say a SWUG is a girl who stays in with a bottle of wine on weekends to watch her idol Liz Lemon on "30 Rock" reruns.
As far as I can tell, the common theme is a general attitude of just not caring. SWUGs are women who have collectively sighed and thrown up their hands at college social life. They've given up on deciphering cryptic texts and defining the difference between "exclusively hooking up" and "dating." Whether it translates into going out every night or not going out at all, SWUGs are no longer concerned with maintaining reputations or meeting social expectations. They are done-it-all, don't-give-a-damn transformations of their bright-eyed, image-conscious freshmen selves.
There has been a lot of talk about whether the "SWUG trend" is just a glorified bout of senioritis or if it is a sign of a disintegrating feminist movement. Apparently Yalies got so worked up over the acronym's meaning that they held a panel on the topic titled "SWUGLIFE: A Colloquium." So is SWUG feminist, anti-feminist, pseudo-intellectual, self-degrading, or self-aggrandizing?
I have no idea. I am too busy being a SWUG to examine its social impact.
I started using the word SWUG back in October, when I discovered the term through a Yalie friend. It was useful, mostly as an explanation for my otherwise idiotic behavior. Drinks on a Tuesday night? Finding a wine opener in the bottom of my book bag? #swuglife. But also: spending Saturday night in J.P. Licks? Watching House of Cards in a weekend marathon session? #swugsohard.
I'm not sure what the SWUG thing means for Young Women or for the State of Feminism. It does seem like women at Harvard moved into the Yard looking for something out of their college experience that they never found, and that now, as we live out the last days of our undergraduate existence, we have given up on looking for it, opting instead to flaunt our DGAF attitude as we approach graduation. But mostly, I find the acronym an easy way to explain all the reasons why the highlight of last weekend wasn't going to a big, fun, listed party; it was discovering, after leaving the party sans male companion and changing out of my party dress and into an oversized bro tank, that M&Ms and rice cakes are the best combination of seemingly random snack food ever.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
 
WHAT IT IS
In 2010, Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi committed suicide after his roommate shared a video over the internet of his romantic encounters with another man; 15-year-old Phoebe Prince hanged herself after being tormented online by girls from her high school; most recently, Rehtaeh Parsons attempted suicide and died several days later after her peers shared images of her rape.
 
Kids can be cruel—and it's clear that the newest technology can enable them to be even crueler. With the advent of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, not to mention instant picture messaging over cell phones, even the briefest of debaucherous acts become immediately immortalized. Using the internet to bully peers, aptly called "cyberbullying," has become an increasingly frequent phenomenon in recent years.
 A recent op-ed in the New York Times, however, suggests that we're being overzealous in our definition of "bullying." The piece's author, Emily Bazelon, argues: "The word is being overused—expanding, accordionlike, to encompass both appalling violence or harassment and a few mean words." Is it possible to say, however, that "a few mean words" does not constitute bullying when these very words—or images, or videos—can and do drive some to take their own lives?
Although social media has its obvious benefits, it is just as obvious to most that whatever these kids are doing, bullying or not, something must be done to prevent teenagers from being tormented by their peers to the point of suicide. The question is: What?

 
 
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
 
Everyone's seen the typical teenage "mean girl" comedy—there's "Mean Girls," for starters, which depicts even lesser evils than the homicidal adolescents in "Heathers," and then there's every John Hughes movie portraying the hell that is high school. "Drama," as girls tend to dub conflict in school, is seemingly unavoidable in a world of proms, cliques, and anthropologically divided cafeterias. Bazelon cites a 2011 study by Alice E. Marwick and danah boyd in which they "argue that the emic use of 'drama' allows teens to distance themselves from practices which adults may conceptualize as bullying." Bazelon believes that when school-aged children engage in online altercations, the term "bullying" is thrown around too readily. "Drama," in high school and college jargon, arouses a sense of girlish pettiness; bullying, until the phenomenon of cyberbullying, brought about an image of a burly kid on the schoolyard who stole your lunch money. But in tragic situations such as the recent passing of Rehtaeh Parsons, is the term "bullying" severe enough?
 
SO WHAT?
In an age where nothing's official until it's plastered onto your Facebook profile and anyone can document anything with a snap of their iPhone, virtually any minor transgression may end up resulting in a tense situation for the most unsuspecting of people. Our online personas have become virtual representations of who we are as people: Anyone with Wi-Fi access can see where we're from, what we do, where we go, and whom we're friends with, all in just a few clicks. A survey from last year showed that 70% of employers decided to not hire a candidate based on "something found out about her online"; in 2008, 10% of college admissions officers admitted to peeking at profiles when making admissions decisions, and 38% of those officers said their snooping negatively impacted applicants.
 
This heightening dependency on online identities makes cyberbullying all the more scary. According to dosomething.org, 43% of kids have been victim to some form of cyberbullying at some point. And teen suicides are coming to be associated with this kind of bullying more and more: A report from 2012 stated that out of 41 teenage suicides in Canada, the UK, and the US, 78% of the victims experienced bullying both online and in person, with 17% experiencing cyberbullying alone.
Cyberbullying is not some far-removed phenomenon that happens to teenagers somewhere else. It's all around us, and more friends and acquaintances than we think may have felt its effects. With social media taking up more and more time in our lives, there's a greater chance that it will happen to us. Whether it's petty drama or not, bullying deserves to be taken seriously. Since social hierarchy is so crucial among teenagers, even the most minor of online altercations can be devastating. With research that proves that teens' very lives are at stake, we simply can't take chances by dichotomizing the malicious actions teenagers take against one another. If someone engages in online "drama," and it is labeled as such rather than being called cyberbullying, they are likely to get away with it and may go on to commit even more damaging acts in the future. A bully is a bully, no matter how you look at him, or at her.
 
 
THE TAKEAWAY
 
Whether it's online, in person, mildly dramatic, or exceedingly cruel, bullying is not OK. If even one life is saved by continuing to add negative connotations to the word "bullying," then there is no harm done in "overusing" it. Anyone who has attended high school will tell you about the horror and humiliation that one can feel in the face of social strife; nowadays, with the permanency of the Internet, it can feel like such problems may literally never go away, but will instead follow you forever and be visible to anyone you meet. Emily Bazelon says that "bullying is a problem we can and should address. But not if we're wrongly led to believe that it's everything and everywhere." Most—if not all—victims of cyberbullying would likely counter Bazelon's argument, pointing out that the object of their torment is at the fingertips of any iPhone user, and that the impact goes beyond mere "drama." Suicides like Rehtaeh Parsons' are evidence enough that bullying is a major problem and should not be trivialized. Thus, how it is being addressed is something that must be constantly evaluated, especially as new methods of social interaction are created, and ultimately, abused.
