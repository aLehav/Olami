After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unarmed white man is shot and killed by a black police officer, prompting an intense investigation by the Department of Justice. Meanwhile, a black teenager was killed by a police officer months ago, and police have swept this under the rug.
This is the general premise of “Shots Fired,” a new ten-part drama on Fox that premiered on March 22. The subject matter of the series is particularly relevant today. But how is the actual show? Well, you can’t deny that the pilot episode of “Shots Fired” is ambitious. However, it ultimately poses way more questions than it can answer, leading to an episode that is too muddy and cluttered to say anything substantial about its topic.
The episode opens with the aftermath of the shooting of Jesse Carr by Officer Joshua Beck. Soon after, Special Prosecutor Preston Terry teams up with Ashe Akino, a cop-turned-investigator, to figure out whether racism informed Officer Beck’s actions. Immediately, an interesting conflict is set up between the two: Terry wishes to put aside any feelings of loyalty or obligation and find out the objective truth, while Akino wants to find the truth but also hopes to support the black community in the fight against racism. However, the episode doesn’t really do much to develop this dynamic. Instead, it has the two characters go on their own separate paths.
The episode introduces many more ideas than it develops. A handful of questions are raised regarding racism, police brutality, and corruption. However, these questions are never really answered, and even when they are, they often contradict each other. For example, a pivotal scene involves a white woman and a black woman putting aside their differences and uniting as a way to show that humans shouldn’t be governed by racism, but rather by a love for people. However, throughout the entire episode, the very protagonists of the episode undermine this idea by wantonly accusing all kinds of people of racism.
In addition, the episode introduces other subplots to try to cover more themes, such as family, but these have so little substance that that they end up just cluttering the runtime. There are a few short scenes involving Akino and her daughter’s father, who are fighting over custody of their child. However, not only is the audience not invested enough in the character of Akino at this point, but this storyline is so detached from the rest of the situations and themes of the episode that there is no possibility for emotional weight and meaning.
Nevertheless, Sanaa Lathan turns in an exceptional performance as Akino. The nuance that Lathan brings to the character perfectly displays Akino’s pain in her more personal moments, but also suggests that there is a significant backstory to the character that has shaped her into who she is. On the other hand, Akino’s public face is one of both power and determination, and Lathan brings a sense of authority to the character. Stephan James also delivers a solid performance as Preston Terry, offering a stoicism that fits his stubborn character.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a pilot that showed a lot of potential, the second episode of “Shots Fired,” titled “Hour Two: Betrayal of Trust,” is a pretty big disappointment. While the first episode showed signs of a season that would dive deep into socially and politically relevant topics, this episode instead has more of the bad elements from “Hour One” and less of the good. More uninteresting subplots and cluttering themes are crammed in, and the overall storyline fails to move forward.
One of the highlights of the first episode was the questions it posed about racism, white supremacy, and police brutality. Even if those questions contradicted themselves at times, they still raised interesting points of discussion. In this episode, however, fewer questions are raised in favor of a much simpler and more uninteresting storyline. Terry and Akino see a leaked video of Officer Beck saying that he hunts down whites, so they have to find out whether or not the video, featuring a drunk Beck, can be used as evidence in Beck’s case. Not only does this story remain unresolved by the end of the episode, but it also muddles the themes of the show. Its message contradicts the very premise of anti-racism that other characters of the show represent: While people in the church are preaching about unity between races, investigators and police are doing anything but putting racism aside, instead arguing over which characters are the most racist.
Numerous new storylines and ideas are introduced, but they merely add clutter—not substance—to the series. Even though the pilot’s subplot dealing with Ashe Akino’s struggle to keep custody of her daughter didn’t really pack any emotional punch, this episode introduces another subplot about family, this time about Preston Terry, the special prosecutor, trying to prove his worth to his brother and his father. This is clearly meant to humanize the character of Terry, but it ends up not actually doing much to reveal his humanity, as all Terry does is argue with his family. In addition to the broad topic of racism, this episode also tries to introduce the idea of religion and the role it plays in the Black Lives Matter movement. While this is certainly a worthwhile subject to touch upon, it ends up feeling detached from the journey of the protagonists, who have virtually zero encounters with religion. Ultimately, it doesn’t help move the main story of the series forward.
Thankfully, Sanaa Lathan’s performance as Akino once again shines in this episode. In addition, Aisha Hinds, who was first introduced in the pilot episode, is given room to grow and stand out in this episode as Pastor Janae James—a prayer that she gives is a highlight of the episode, filled with emotion and drive. The rest of the performances are nothing special, but serve their purposes.
Overall, “Hour Two” is a step back from the previous episode. The pilot, although pretty messy, showed a lot of potential for an interesting discussion of racism and the current political climate of America. However, these interesting topics mostly take a backseat in this episode with the arrival of more subplots, characters, and ideas that end up just cluttering the series’ story and themes. The series looks to be more about the characters’ lives, judging from the increased emphasis on their families, rather than their journeys in this investigative case. Because there was never much reason to care for the characters themselves in the first place, this makes the series, and this episode in particular, ultimately uninteresting.

One work currently on display at the Harvard Student Art Show is “We Gave Our Consent,” a mixed media piece by Keith R. Hartwig that reconstructs Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan’s faces with LEGO bricks. Currently a student at the Graduate School of Design, Hartwig made the piece for an earlier exhibition, titled “Surveillance.” This body of work, which Hartwig produced with creative partner Daniel Newman, explores how surveillance has evolved into a common aspect of daily life and how the concept of surveillance generates language, symbolism, narrative, and identity. The Crimson sat down with Hartwig to discuss “We Gave Our Consent” and his thoughts more generally on the intersection of art and politics.
The Harvard Crimson: Tell us a bit about the piece you chose to exhibit at the Harvard Student Art Show.
Keith R. Hartwig: That image in particular is from a series titled “We Gave Our Consent.” Each image presents essentially a popularized media image that explores the question of why we allow ourselves to be surveilled. Essentially, I tried to sort of complicate our understanding of why it is we either opt in or opt out of certain surveillance practices, whether those are state-agency surveillance practices, whether those are corporate or economic practices, or even if they’re sort of self-imposed surveillance, like putting a camera in your house to monitor your house or in your baby’s room to monitor your baby. All of these are various levels of surveillance, they sort of have their own complexities and nuances and so each of those images sort of tries to suss out those various differences.
THC: What’s an example of a way in which surveillance tactics have become more pronounced in the digital age?
KRH: We came across this really interesting example of a Barbie doll that is essentially an IOT device. It records the conversations that your children have with the doll in order to essentially, through some sort of feedback in the algorithm, enhance the dialogue between the Barbie doll and your child. So it takes certain keywords, certain phrases, and it customizes the communicative experience between the doll and your child. But all of that data is essentially being stored and archived somewhere and, you know, what are the layers there that need to be peeled back? Is that data being collected and sold? Is that data being used for other purposes? What are your rights to that data?
THC: How is your work political?
KRH: We kind of see ourselves as both advocates and adversaries. “Advocates” is perhaps the easier term to understand and convey to people. But this term “adversary” is one that I’m sort of borrowing from Chantal Mouffe’s definition of adversary and agonistic politics. What she says is that while we conflict with dominant ideologies and certain hegemonic practices, we’re part of the same political association, and we share a common symbolic space, within which the conflict takes place or is staged. She complicates Jürgen Habermas’ definition of the political public sphere. So for us, that public space is basically the public domain. It’s the built environment, it’s the urban context, which we believe because of its public nature is sort of inherently political. So it’s not overtly political, but because of the spaces we’re interested in and the things we advocate for, we sort of have this adversarial tension or friction with the public domain, where our work resides.
THC: How has your relationship with surveillance in your own life changed as a result of your artistic work?
KRH: You come to realize that certain things are fairly benign and have been hyperbolized, and blown out of proportion by the media and the common understanding of them is one such that, oh this is an extremely malevolent practice. And then you realize, okay, maybe it’s not as awful as we think. And then there are other ones that are far more surreptitious and actually malevolent, or reinforce or reinscribe certain social or cultural biases. When you discover that a certain company may be biased against a certain demographic, you stop using them.
THC: How do you want viewers to react to your work?
KRH: Dan and I aren’t so interested in people walking away with some sort of prepackaged message, of “this is what we as the artists were trying to say to you.” In fact, we’re way more interested in how we can construct a dialogue around this and together work through these issues and come to some sort of mutually created understanding, or perhaps even more conflict and tension around these issues so that they’re not just taken for granted or accepted.
THC: What do you think about art as a political tool?
KRH: People who are policy makers, who are working to produce real, substantial change, changing institutional frameworks, those processes take a long time. They are highly contested spaces for social engagement and they’re highly bureaucratic. Whereas I think artists can work quickly, they can iterate quickly, they can wheatpaste something on the street overnight. So they can sort of very quickly respond to and potentially catalyze more action or catalyze more conversations. At the same time, generally speaking, the faster you produce something probably the less consequential it’s going to be. And so artists can also work slow. They can also work with a method and a practice that’s drawn out over years and that’s goal is to produce real, substantial, consequential, meaningful change or dialogue.

April 28 marks the end of President Trump’s first 100 days in office, and with it, the expiration of the current funding level for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. President Trump’s administration is currently considering a complete elimination of these programs, alongside the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Institute of Museums and Library Services, as part of a budget plan to cut annual federal spending by over $1 trillion. In 2016, the fiscal spending of the U.S. totaled to $3.899 trillion. The combined spending of the NEA, NEH, CPB, and IMLS constituted less than 0.02% of that.
Last fall, Massachusetts received almost $1.7 million in grants from the NEA. However, Greg P. Liakos, communications director at the Massachusetts Cultural Council, said that federal funding doesn’t constitute the majority of fiscal support in Massachusetts for the arts.
“It has never represented a significant system of the support system of the non-profit artistic organizations in the Massachusetts community,” he said.
Instead, these organizations provide high-level approval and support for developments in the arts. “A grant from a government agency, like the NEA, that has gone through a rigorous review process can be a real source and seal of approval that shows we have real quality and rigor in terms of our program, and that can lead to many other open doors,” Liakos said.
This can be especially important for starting organizations in under-resourced regions. Lizabeth Cohen, professor and the Dean of the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, said that Harvard’s academic research will continue on without federal funding, but other regions and institutions may not be able to do so. “Despite the stereotypes, [the NEA and NEH] are not supporting only elite high culture,” Cohen said. “Rather, both endowments have worked hard to spread their limited resources throughout the country, to rural and metropolitan communities alike.”
In Boston, smaller organizations such as Project STEP (String Training Educational Program for Students of Color) benefit from NEA funding. The organization provides opportunities for students in struggling neighborhoods to explore music to which they otherwise would have lacked access.
Gabriella Sana, Executive Director of Project STEP, said that especially in the starting stages of the organization, government support helped immensely. “In the past, when our operating budget was smaller and we were just beginning, the NEA funding made up up to 15 to 20 percent of our operating budget,” Sana said.
Another local project funded by the NEA is the Boston ArtScience Prize. Kimberly Suda-Blake, who is a staff member of the ArtScience Prize, said that science and art are actually closely interrelated. “What we do at the Idea Translation Labs in Boston is at the intersection of art and science, and the arts funding is an integral part to all our projects,” she said.
Cohen also notes how important NEH funding was in her academic career. “I am aware that for historians like me, an NEH grant can make a very real difference in one’s career, as it provides resources to support research and writing. To supplement sabbatical pay, I have had two NEH grants over my career,” she said.
In addition, she sees the NEH grants as a mark of accomplishment and a responsibility to be fulfilled. “Not only was the financial support helpful, but I was proud that my historical work was  being supported by public funds,” Cohen said. “As an NEH recipient, I felt a great responsibility to do work that would prove worthy of the nation’s trust.”
Despite the possible threats, Sana said that the NEA itself has not talked much about shutting down. This is not the first time that the NEA or NEH has faced cutbacks from the government. President Reagan also arrived in office with intentions to eliminate the NEA. The program only saw budget cuts of ten percent by the end of his term in office.
There has always been some opposition, according to Liakos. “There’s always been consistent arguments about government funding in general and federal funding for the arts in various pockets of American political discourse,” he said. “The most recent really is largely grounded in libertarian ideology.”
For Stephen Greenblatt, a professor in Harvard’s English department, however, there is no more pressing need than supporting the arts. “That’s a ridiculous question. It’s almost offensive. America is a great country with lots of culture and that culture is important to who we are. Is it not? The way we sustain that culture is through the humanities, through the arts,” he said.
Across the board, arts organizations agree that budget cuts to the NEA would be detrimental. Kathleen Bitetti, artist and co-founder of the Massachusetts Artists Leaders Coalition, said, "I find nothing good about the Trump budget for our sector. He wants to eliminate everything, and it's not good for anybody."
Other arts organizations in Boston have also voiced their concerns and support for the NEA. Principal dancer John Lam of the Boston Ballet released a video of “new work with 22 Boston Ballet dancers sharing what dance means to them.” In a Boston Ballet press release, Lam said, “I wanted to create a work that expresses the importance and purpose of dance at this crucial time in our society.”
As polarized as the recent political scene may seem, Greenblatt believes that arts funding should be supported regardless. “The arts are not, and should not be, a partisan issue,” he said. “In fact, I would love to see funding increased,” he said. “There’s a lot of issues that are blue-state and red-state … But not the issue of the arts.”
The benefits of the NEA transcend social classes, according to Greenblatt. “This funding doesn’t exist in order to enhance the cultural life of a number of ultra-elite wealthy people,” he said. “It’s shared very very broadly, and it’s something that America needs.”

On Thursday, April 20, Senator Elizabeth Warren promoted her latest book, “This Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save Our Middle Class,” in Old South Church in Boston. During the event, organized by the Harvard Book Store, Warren read from the book before answering questions from the audience.
Warren began her reading with a poignant passage about Mike, an Alzheimer’s patient who asked her to support funding for Alzheimer’s research during his visit to her office in Washington. Warren made it clear that her book was dedicated both to the lives of everyday citizens and to enforcing the promise of government to fairly represent its constituency.
Warren portrayed the situation as a call to action on the part of everyday citizens. “This book is written as an act of optimism,” she said. “This book is about how we get in the fight, and how we’re effective in the fight.”
Warren also stressed the importance of factual evidence as a major component of the book. “It’s got some facts in it, because I think facts are important. I never thought in all my years I’d need to find a word to modify the word ‘facts,’” Warren said, in an obvious critique of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway’s “alternative facts.” The audience cheered.
Despite its often light-hearted tone of mutual commiseration, the event was also serious. Warren acknowledged that Democrats are facing difficult circumstances in Washington. “Donald Trump is now poised to deliver the knockout blow to America’s working families,” Warren said. “This isn’t about Donald Trump’s crazy tweets. This is not about what Donald Trump says. This is about what Donald Trump does.”
“He’s been there less than one hundred days,” she said, then paused. “Oh, Lord.” A flicker of exasperation was briefly visible through the veneer of political composure. The audience laughed. She continued. “What’s he done? He’s made it easier for corporations to steal people’s paychecks. He’s made it easier to hide information when corporations kill or maim their employees. He’s made it easier for his advisors to cheat retirees. So now the question is, what are we going to about it? The answer is, I’m fighting back.”
The event had a distinctly feminist tone. Warren lauded the protesters at the Women’s March following Trump’s inauguration. Several audience members wore pro-women’s rights T-shirts. One attendee in the balcony raised a hand-lettered sign reading, “Nevertheless, She Persisted,” referring to Senate Republicans’ silencing of Warren’s speech against Jeff Sessions in early February.
Warren remembered fondly the morning of the Women’s March. “The very act of marching delivered the loudest possible proclamation of our deep-down, unshakable belief that we can make democracy work again,” she read from the book. “By insisting that this government serve the people, we are an army: an army filled with optimism and hope and fierce determination.”
After the reading portion of the event, Warren fielded questions from the audience on gun control, health care, and racism. Colby Anderson, the leader of the Boston chapter of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, summarized recent developments in legislature concerning gun laws. “What can you do, and what can we the public do to stop dangerous bills like this from becoming law?” she asked.
“There are a lot of things that can be done at the state level, but guns, environmental issues, and certain economic issues have to be done at the national level,” Warren said in response to Anderson. “If they pass a law that says, in effect, Massachusetts is now subject to whatever it is that Texas or Arizona or Utah wants to do with their gun laws, we’re in real trouble. It’s not what we choose, and it puts us and our children at risk in ways that we choose deliberately not to do. So this is a fight that has to happen at the national level.”
Kathy Watkins, an organizer from the Cambridge Residents’ Alliance, asked if Warren had signed onto the Single Payer Health Care Bill. Warren responded that there were several bills in the works. “Health care is a human right,” she said.
One audience member, having seen Warren speak at an event preceding the 2012 election, expressed how her dismay at the 2012 Republican nominee paled in comparison to her fear of President Trump. “I could not imagine how scared I was about Mitt Romney,” she said, in disbelief. Warren nodded knowingly. “He seems, in retrospect, so normal.”
The event concluded with a powerful question about racism and discrimination, from an audience member who had recently gotten her PhD. “How can we break down the racial and gender barriers to equality?” she asked.

Patty Chang’s voice rings through the gallery: “When my aunt died, I got a plate. It was the kind of plate with a color photo printed on it in a poisonous ink that you couldn’t eat or else you’d die too.” Past Andy Warhol’s two paneled “Red Disaster,” past Jenny Holzer’s LED signboard, blaring “DREAMING WHILE AWAKE IS A FRIGHTENING CONTRADICTION,” is Chang’s grainy image in a small television screen. The performance artist carves into her white bra, revealing a cantaloupe strapped to her left breast. While reciting her story, Chang slices the flesh, scoops out the seeds, and spoons the fruit into her mouth.
This is “Political Intent,” an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts composed of work by eight women from four continents. “Political Intent” opened last fall during the heat of the 2016 presidential election, and though the timing and name would suggest its inspiration was politics at large, its curator Jen E. Mergel ’98 said otherwise.
“It wasn’t about the American presidential election or the system. It was very much about the politics of dynamics of power that we all engage with—with every decision we make, in every interaction, everyday,” said Mergel. “Who do you listen to? Who do you respect? Who actually has or is in a position to make the final decision? These are all political decisions.”
In fact, the roots of “Political Intent” date back to 2012, when the Guerrilla Girls—a feminist activist artist group based in New York—visited the MFA to do a “weenie count” of the number of male artists and announced that women artists were underrepresented in the museum. The group parked a billboard in front of the MFA that said “Do women have to be naked to get into Boston museums?”
Mergel praised the protest art at the time, and even included eight Guerrilla Girl posters in “Political Intent.” “For me personally, as a curator, it was an opportunity to show great work by women,” said Mergel on curating the exhibit. “To show much how much we had done with our collecting since the Guerrilla Girls had come.”
One of the Guerrilla Girl posters is pastel pink with curly script. It reads “Dearest Art Collector, It has come to our attention that your collection, like most, does not contain enough art by women. We know that you feel terrible about this and will rectify the situation immediately. All our love, Guerrilla Girls.” At the top of the poster, a drawn flower with a frowning face lies on its side.
“The exhibition highlights work by women that galvanizes the radical liberation of women and women of color,” said Tufts professor Danielle J. Abrams in an emailed statement. Themes of race, gender identity, and sexuality are frequent subjects in “Political Intent.” Andrea Bowers’s “Goddess” for example deals with ideas of trans rights and sisterhood, and features a set of dark brown wings, made of turkey and goose feathers. “The sculpture’s wings are a route to ascension,” said Abrams. “Wings can also enfold those who are most vulnerable. When there is misogyny, violence, and injustice, wings can provide asylum.” From the wings trail multicolored ribbons with embroidered slogans like “TRANS LIBERATION IS WOMEN’S LIBERATION” or “SISTERS BE STRONG.”
“It’s very relevant, and it’s needed,” said Justina A. Crawford on “Political Intent.” Crawford is a Manager of Lectures, Courses, and Concerts at the MFA, and has organized panel discussions based on themes found in “Political Intent.” “It’s great that we get to use that as a springboard for topics that our community can then reference and talk about.”
Though “Political Intent” was not directly inspired by current events, it remains more relevant than ever. “In times of tension or when expression feels threatened or when understandings of the truth are called into question, I do think that art that engages with those issues head-on is more important than ever,” said Mergel. “That’s not to discount other types of artmaking that focus on different areas. I do think that there’s great urgency and relevancy to pay attention to art that’s showing us or exposing us to forces in society that may not be visible.”
“Political Intent” will close July 30, 2017.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philip A.N. Chowdry ’19 has produced a number of artworks that deal with current political issues, especially the presidency of Donald Trump. His recent work “The Melania,” which was on display at The Harvard Student Art Show this year, reflects the media’s portrayal of Melania Trump, and “Our Vendetta,” an ongoing series, takes the form of protest posters and have been distributed around Harvard Square. The Crimson sat down with him to discuss his inspirations and working process.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your reaction when you first heard about the election result?
Philip A.N. Chowdry: I actually was not that surprised. I already viewed Trump as the result of a long line of postmodernist phenomena, when you reach a point when postmodernism becomes so extreme, and relativism becomes so extreme that it can lead to someone living in their own version of reality and not having to accept some sort of true reality. To a certain extent I endorse that. If I on a very hedonist level want to eat, sleep, and f***, then I’m going to endorse whichever candidate forms the reality that allows me to eat, sleep, and f*** the most. Why not? I only care in regards that [other] people also have their rights to form their own reality and they are being infringed upon. That’s my greatest fear about Donald Trump, as well as the ineptitude of anyone to really combat him on the ground of “Look, I’m more informed, I’m more knowledgeable. These are the truths. These are the facts.” At the same time, I’m kind of curious how it goes. I think there is a massive change. Something will happen after postmodernism. I don’t know if it’s going to be a swing back, but I’m interested to see if anything will happen.
THC: So you think of Trump as the end of postmodernism?
PANC: You can say it’s the ugly side of it. It’s the side that makes people most comfortable, when I can’t shake someone and say “This is the real world.” Going back all the way, Plato wrote that we needed the Ideals so that when I say strawberry, you’ll have basically the same Ideal and it allows us to communicate. But if you throw all that out of the window, I can say strawberry to you as many times as I want to, and that’s not going to change your conception of strawberries. So Donald Trump to me is just inevitable.
THC: What would you like to achieve with your Trump-related works?
PANC: I see a lot of people trying to combat Trump, and I think certain components of it don’t really have the ability to combat him. For example, if I attack someone in a protest, that completely superficializes what is at least claimed to be something that has depth. A lot of my works are making moral indictments about that. They are saying, “You view yourself as the complete opposite of this group, when really you’re basically the same in many senses.” You do form your own sense of reality, for example.
A lot of the works in my new series, “Our Vendetta,” are tongue in cheek. One of them says “We did not ask for an orange as president. Oranges are for crushing into juice. Now we make orange juice.” This obviously is a joke about Trump’s bizarre, orange face, but it’s also almost a reference to assassination. I want to check what I see as what people blindly follow.
I read on Facebook a ten-page treatise of why Trump is bad. I just view that as a bizarre form of narcissistic, superficial protest that doesn’t have any facts at the end of the day. You can say maybe it inspired some people, that some people would read the whole treatise, but I just don’t believe those forms of protest are effective. … There’s something about Facebook that pushes protests to the degree of Popism that completely removes visceral reality. When you bring things to such superficial level, you know that you don’t have the ability to change the system beyond the pleasuristic activities of “I really like this argument. I’m going to comment something.” There’s no internal introspection. You’re just adding to your facade. You’re not going to convince someone’s opinion by calling them idiots over and over. There are some Trump supporters who are complete racists, white supremacists, but at the same time you can’t convince them not to be white supremacists with derisive comments. There may be no way to convince white supremacists, but the closest you can get is when you at least try to empathize with them. Otherwise you’re just gonna say, “This person is a white supremacist. That’s her facade. I’m going to produce my own facade that says ‘f*** you’.”
THC: “Our Vendetta” is mocking that kind of language.
PANC: It is in a way mocking our language. On Harvard’s campus, there are some Trump supporters, but the predominant view is definitely anti-Trump. So part of it is, “Who’s my audience?” … “Our Vendetta” polarizes people, and I think some polarization now, particularly in small groups like Harvard that share such a homogenous ideology, leads to questioning of your community: “I thought I was really anti-Trump, but this is so extreme. Is it wrong if I reject this? If I do reject this, what is my true belief? Do I really want to follow these ideals to their end?” ... It produces a sense of discontinuity in your reality, a sense of unease. Then for a moment they at least check their reality as relativistic.

Lav Diaz is a Filipino independent filmmaker whose works primarily focus on contemporary social and political issues and their relations with the individual. He has won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, among other awards. He is currently working on a new film and a book during a fellowship at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. The Crimson sat down with Diaz to talk about his practice.

The Harvard Crimson: Could you tell me about the book you’re writing?
Lav Diaz: It has many alterations or incarnations. At first I just wanted to work on something about our praxis in southeast Asia, because we have a very different way of doing cinema—an average filmmaker can make three to five films a year in that region without huge budgets. I know a lot of western filmmakers. Their usual process for the preparation alone will take them two years. Prepare their material, work on some funding, work on some casting, and it’s always that: two years. ... But if there’s no budget, then what are you going to do?  They always lack that in the country [of the Philippines] and in the region, so it’s a model of necessity for us, to just do it. ... If something is engaging you, and then you wait, it will be f***ed up. So I thought, what’s the best way to negate this problem, this conundrum?
Around the early ’90s, I was working in New York as a journalist, and that taught me. I saw a lot of independent filmmakers around the area. They bought their 16mm camera, and they shot. When digital came, I said I was going to buy my own camera. The idea [of my book] is from that: a liberated cinema, how we are so different in our ways of doing cinema, and also the idea of not depending on the aesthetics of Hollywood. Cinema is still very young, so why do we have to follow all these so-called rules? The two-hour runtime thing, you know, “You have to make it fast, don’t make it linger.”  I say, “Well, no, it’s art. We have to liberate this.” It’s that idea. I’m working on that.
THC: Would you call it theoretical?
LD: No, not really.  It’s a mix: theoretical, praxis, perspectives. I cite examples: Malaysian filmmakers, Indonesian filmmakers, my own methodology, and comparing them all. It also connects with the struggle of the region, of our people. When I was writing it, it was becoming a novel.
THC: Do you think of yourself as a filmmaker or as a writer?
LD: No, neither. I’m just engaged. Cinema for me is my medium of engagement on this life, the best way that I can express myself. It’s just a medium to me. I thought to call myself more of a poet than a filmmaker. This is just the medium that’s easiest for me. I can do it, I can control it. ... I don’t even understand cinema at all. It’s like, okay, this is my form of engagement in life, as simple as that. If anybody asks me, what is cinema? It’s poetry, man. That’s it.
THC: But then maybe the book you’re writing is an answer. You’re working through that question.
LD: Actually this is the first chapter: “What is cinema?” Just like André Bazin. It all comes to that.
THC: In your films, you talk about discourse as something that must cooperate with practice, and I’m curious how being here at Harvard, in this academic community, fits into this cooperation. How do you like it here?
LD: I love it. At first I felt like an imposter. What was I doing here? I’m not an academic, although I graduated from college. I come from a family of farmers and some teachers. How could I immerse in this kind of milieu? It’s very mental, all intellect, all discourse. But I’ve adjusted well now. I can see the imperative––the importance of having these kinds of institutions in the world. It’s like inside [the world], looking in. I can see more the importance of aesthetics, of cinema, of engaging life and using the medium. I can see now how important cinema is. I can really see it now, very well. I have very intelligent and very engaging co-fellows. And they taught me that we must keep engaging life, keep engaging things. That’s academics. It can teach you that.
THC: Do you see your cinema as a popular art? Do you think about your audiences?
LD: I don’t know where it will lead me. I’m just telling stories anyways, so if somebody discovers my work, then it’s just about that. I think more of my audiences [as part of the practice]: the issue of engagement, the issue of discourse, but I don’t think of them in the sense that I want to do this for them, to please them, to make more money. ... It’s so nasty and dirty to think of cinema as just a product. I want it to be like what we’re doing now. You are here because of my cinema, so we’re talking about it. And we’re not just talking about cinema now. We’re talking about life, trying to question everything. That dynamic, I want to have that with my audience. Just a simple discourse with my audience—or with my grandson, maybe, someday.
THC: I have to ask about the current political situation, both here and in the Philippines.
LD: Everything is fucked up. It’s an abyss opened up, a slide towards barbarism every day.
THC: Before it happened, could you see it coming?
LD: Of course, if you see that there’s this huge wall of ignorance. Making cinema allows me to go to the countryside, to the islands. The biggest issue I can see is ignorance, this huge wall of ignorance, and it creates all these massive things. I’m always afraid that things are going to happen, and it’s happening. It’s our failure, it’s our debacle. I haven’t done anything yet [to confront it]. You see what’s happening all over the world, and you’re just this very, very tiny thing, the filmmaker or the poet or the writer or anybody. We have to confront life more. The biggest issue is that we have to destroy the wall of ignorance. ... Just yesterday alone, come on, just read the news. In Egypt, two bombings. In Sweden the other day, the truck. The bombing in Syria. It’s actually just going down. It’s an abyss of barbarism, and you wonder, it’s already the 21st century! You look at Harvard, where everything is moving forward intellectually, but then the world is moving away, sliding back to the age of darkness.
THC: But maybe art, or engagement, can hold it together?
LD: If you’re a songwriter, keep writing great songs. If you’re a writer, keep writing something that matters, that matters to you. If you’re a dancer, your physicality. This is the way.
THC: I have some questions that are more specific.  I’m not going to bring up duration, because…
LD: It’s been done!
THC: …it’s been done…
LD: Ad infinitum.
THC: One of the reasons I asked about audience is because I find there’s something in your films that’s retaliating against the current trend in attention span. The other day I was on the bus, and there was a girl in front of me on her phone. She would refresh the screen, see all of her Snapchats, and just thumb quickly through them. I couldn’t process it because the images were moving so quickly. And then the weirdest part was that later she was watching a YouTube video, GoPro footage of people on vacation. I could see the rhythm of the cutting. And it was the same rhythm that she had been flipping through the images on Snapchat! So as I’m trying to think about your films, I think that although you say you want this engagement from your audience, your films seem like a retaliation, a reaction against that frenzied relationship with time.  Do you imagine people watching your movies on a phone, or on a laptop? Is that something that you do, or do you only watch films in the theatre?
LD: I also watch DVDs, because I attend a lot of festivals where I’m part of the jury, and I want to be fair with the filmmaker, so I watch the films twice, in full, sometimes three times. You have to see it in full, to experience it. But what you described is part of the new culture. Everything is on fast-forward. Everybody is being selective now. And it reflects on life. They’re selective with truth, selective with facts, selective with events, so everything is just compartmentalized. That’s life now. Everything is breaking down because of that. You cannot unify time and space.
THC: But that’s exactly what the long takes in your films are doing. It feels like resistance.
LD: My kind of cinema is about “being there.” It’s very different from being subordinated to the action of Tom Cruise in a film. You’re not being there. You’re just following the movement of this actor. With my cinema, you’re being there. You’re part of it. You’re sucked into this universe, so you engage with the whole thing. You can see even the movement of the leaves, the movement of the ants, and it’s so different from being subordinated to the action of the main character.  That’s what the girl was doing: trying to find the action.
THC: You have to give up control in order to engage.
LD: That’s true.
THC: In terms of the long take, it’s not always clear for the audience what to think about. In a more mainstream film, you can see what you’re being told to think. But with the long take there’s so much screen time in which there’s no obvious directive.
LD: You don’t know what’s going to happen. It’s like life.
THC: Sometimes there’s an initial reaction of “nothing is happening,” and then 30 seconds later you have to think about something else. Because you can’t only think “nothing is happening.” It’s almost like a meditation, a meditative space where the audience is projecting something onto the screen, their action, their story.
LD: It’s giving you that space also.
THC: Do you meditate?
LD: For me, doing cinema is a form of meditation. Doing art is a very spiritual thing. That’s what I want to give to my audience, to actually see. That’s cinema: your own life. It’s like you said. You wonder during this very long scene. After a while, you’re thinking of something else before you go back to the film. So you’re being there, in life. ... If you’re thinking differently than just following the movement because of these fast cuts, if you negate that, then you’ll think more, you’ll be reflective, so it’s really very meditative, actually. All of this is very physical. ... I’m trying to tell you, “Hey, hey, reflect on life.  You’re not just in the movies.  You’re in this very real place.”
THC: It sounds so obvious when you say it, but I feel like it’s really easy to miss the point.
LD: Of course! The very first thing that you do [when watching my movies] is that you’ll be very resentful of the form. “Come on, man, it’s so boring! Nine hours of cinema? Eight hours? Four hours? Why not cut it into an hour and a half?” It happened with the new film, when they showed it at the film archive here. One of the fellows really liked the film, but at the same time he told me he could cut the film into two hours. I said, “Really? I can give you the footage. We’ll see.” I actually told him that. He’s a really intelligent guy. I like him a lot. But when he told me that, I was shocked. … I’m waiting for him to send me his cut. It’s really another thing when someone says, “I like your film, but I want to cut it to a more manageable length.” What is a manageable length? It’s another form of questioning existence. Are you really sure with your life? No! There’s no certainty. You have to open it. Certainty is death. It’s f**king death.  Certainty is fascism. It’s fundamentalism, extremism. You’re very certain with the length? It’s very feudal. It’s Hollywood. They imposed that, you know.
THC: Yeah, sorry, I said I wasn’t going to bring up duration. Do you think you’ll ever return to shooting on film? Do you think it’s historical now? Do you think it’s a luxury?
LD: I love celluloid, but I’ve come to terms with it now. I’ve grappled already with the issue of being pure with cinema, of “Oh, I don’t want to do digital.” Again, I have to embrace life. The medium is evolving so fast. There’s a new thing every three months. Technology gives you that, and you have to embrace it. Otherwise you’re not part of the evolution of the medium. But it’s also economics. If I have money, I want to make cinema with 16mm film again, or even with super 8. I want to see those images again. I want to see the real grain, the jerks, all these things, even the noise of the camera. It gives me the feeling of being reborn. I want to go back to that, being tactile with this iron, this very heavy thing, because those are the first things that I used. The Arri 2c, I want to go back to those guys. So it’s basic economics. Celluloid is beautiful for me, but you also need money and time.
THC: For me it has something to do with the experience of time. There’s something about the photograph that expresses the past in a way, but the digital image is more about the present, more of a currency. You can manipulate it, you can dispose of it, you can revive it. It’s an image created more for sharing than for recording.
LD: It all depends on the individual perspective now. How do you deal with it? is this thing going to last? For me, I want to leave something that’s … I don’t want to use the word “timeless,” but I want people to be able to go back to it. I still want to read the poems of Rilke, Whitman. I want to go back to those things. If you look at the technology now, there’s the danger [of losing old works]. It’s changing every three months, so how do you keep it? So you see the importance of archiving, of the museums. I went to London just a few weeks ago, where they showed the print of my old film “Batang West Side” on 35mm, and then they showed the new one, “The Woman Who Left,” and there’s a huge difference.
THC: Then again, while digital is not as good for archiving, it allows the agility to be able to just go out and shoot, and that’s political.
LD: It is happening now. A lot of young filmmakers here are doing it. They buy a camera and they shoot, and you can see it on YouTube. They’re so engaged with the new technology. It’s a new culture of doing things that’s destroying all these bad habits of the institution, the super-institution, of cinema.
THC: Can we talk about new cinema?  Who’s exciting to you in cinema right now?
LD: I haven’t seen a lot because I stopped going to festivals now, and I’m just reading things.
THC: What are you reading?
LD: I’m more into reading novels now. Virginia Woolf, Nabokov, Platonov, George Saunders, going back to the late Benedict Anderson which is history. I’m writing a lot also. But it’s all helping me with my cinema. It gives me that impetus, that energy, when I read all these works. I was reading “The Waves” by Virginia Woolf last night. It’s beautiful the way she works with discourse and words. Platonov, in “The Foundation Pit,” has a way of saying things that’s different from all the other works in Russia. It gives you that … I don’t want to use the word, but we have to use it, hope. Just like with your question a while ago, can we survive all this madness? I think we just keep moving, pushing things. The real problem is ignorance. So it’s all about re-educating people. We have to go back to the truth, to really understanding the facts. That’s why we’re losing. It’s happening because we don’t want to see the truth. That’s a big problem. A very, very intelligent person can slide back because of that.
It’s very energizing to read novels now, because you lay low, you have to rest, and then you start thinking, and you can see the spaces. There are still spaces in life. It’s not just ISIS, not just the Middle East. There’s still the sea, there’s still the mountains. You can still see the trees. I was walking in Queens yesterday, just walking and walking, and I passed a Best Buy. I went in, and there’s a new camera, there’s a new tripod, and it just engaged me again. You discover the little things and it gives you hope. And then you hold the work of this writer, and you read him, you read her, and they give you something. It’s like being transported to other times when you discover the spaces in Tolstoy, in Dostoevsky, or in Hemingway. You think of Paris now, which is very dark. Everything is uncertain and any time it could just explode. But when you read “A Moveable Feast,” when Hemingway was struggling in Paris, it was beautiful. There’s hope.
THC: Can you talk about the film you’re making now?
LD: It’s called “When the Wives Are Gone.” It’s a film noir. So it’s a gangster movie set on this island, but it will reflect the whole power thing in the country. When I came here in September, I was reading all these news in the Philippines and here, and I was so isolated in my room and I had a guitar there, so I started writing a lot of songs. I was able to write 20 to 25 songs from September to December. So I said to my funder that I was not going to do the noir, that let’s shoot a musical. The film is about what’s happening in the Philippines, the political condition, so we cannot get the permit to shoot in the Philippines. We go to Malaysia, because Malaysia is very similar to the Philippines. We Filipinos are still racially Malay. So it’s a musical, set in the late ’70s. It’s a love story set in the very darkest moments of martial law. That’s the film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When English department chair James W. Simpson told The Crimson on March 23 that future concentrators would be required to take at least one course that featured authors “marginalized for historical reasons,” he met a chorus of off-campus objections. “Campus agitation for an identity-based curriculum is now drearily familiar,” Heather Mac Donald wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. “But Harvard’s recent mandate goes further, creating a new literary typology: On one side are the marginalized authors; on the other, authors who, by implication, may have benefited from ‘racism, patriarchy and heteronormativity.’” The American Spectator called the requirement “victimhood politics,” and the Crimson’s comment sections were similarly harsh.
It would seem that for Harvard, even such relatively minor curricular decisions reverberate throughout national discourse. But for the students and faculty members who advocated for the requirement, the reasons were personal and pedagogical in addition to political. “As an Asian-American English concentrator, it felt as if there were things that were sorely missing,” said Joan J. Li ’17, a member of the department’s student advisory council. “It’s important to hear and know how stories are told and what they’re about from perspectives outside the white mainstream.”
Li said her own experiences with female and nonwhite authors in the English department were an impetus for her advocacy. “What I’ve taken away from studying traditionally marginalized writers is that the way we speak and the way we write stories is all intertwined with identity and who we are,” said Li. “I think it’s very important that what Harvard wants to be, and what the English Department wants to be, is multitudes of stories, and for students to engage in those multitudes.”
Glenda R. Carpio, a professor in the English and African American Studies departments, said she did not see the change as an appeal to identity politics. According to Carpio, the requirement represents a shift away from an assumption that white identities are a nonpolitical default. “What I think that does is it doesn’t ask people to question how the supposed ‘main’ white canon is actually political and also identity politics,” Carpio said. “It’s a default identity, and because it’s a default identity, it’s not taken as a political act. But, in fact, it is.”
Carpio said the requirement was part of a broader effort to diversify the department. “It’s something we have done with the knowledge that we need to revamp the entire curriculum. We don’t want to create a division, like a ‘normal’ requirement versus an ‘ethnic’ requirement,” she said, alluding to the Wall Street Journal editorial. “I could see how people would criticize that, as a thing where you’re calling attention to identity—which is not what we’re doing at all.”
Derek K. Miller, associate director of undergraduate studies in the English department, said the department hoped the requirement would encourage students to consider works from all authors in their full context and disputed the idea that it would unnecessarily politicize the curriculum. “One of the things that has come up repeatedly in our conversations is that all art is a product of and speaks to the social-political circumstances in which it’s made,” he said. “One of the challenges in articulating what it means to have this new requirement is making sure we don’t then pretend that the other artists are somehow not political or not resistant art.”
Miller said the “canon” as it appears in the Wall Street Journal op-ed has evolved over time. “There’s an ahistoricity to the idea that any given author in the English literary tradition is and always has been essential to that tradition,” he said, citing metaphysical poets such as John Donne as an example of how the canon can exclude great works until those works are deliberately reappraised.
Miller and Li both denied that the timing of the requirement was directly related to President Trump’s election. But Miller said politics and the curriculum sometimes intersect unexpectedly. “I’m constantly wondering how the questions I’m asking students to engage with in my courses connect with the problems they’re living with every day. Sometimes that can be very abstracted from something as material as a political campaign, and sometimes it can speak directly to it,” he said. “For example, I proposed a course in fall 2015 on theatrical realism. I didn’t know we’d end up with a political campaign that was about things like fake news and conspiracy theories.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after Trump’s win and inauguration—and the many overused jokes that accompanied them—student comedians on campus are still pushing themselves to produce original and meaningful political content. The relationship between comedy and politics is by no means new, but many students see comedy as an especially relevant outlet for coping with the current political climate. Harry T. Newman-Plotnick ’18 of the Harvard College Stand-up Comic Society believes that comedians are the best equipped to make even the most absurd of news understandable and digestible for the public. “Things are so outlandish now that ‘real news’ can’t handle it properly because it’s so out of their comfort zone,” he said.
But for some, with an influx of comedians capitalizing on the White House’s new administration, political jokes appear more as pandering antics than as products of deep thought and consideration. “You can just get laughs by saying, ‘Oh, Trump’s pretty dumb,’ but that’s just not a good joke,” said Joe B. Palana ’17, another student comedian from HCSUCS. These oversimplified jokes can also pose a risk to meaningful political dialogue. “If you’re making the really basic, dumb, obvious joke, like, ‘Isn’t this thing stupid? Let’s laugh at it,’ then you risk saying that you can’t even have a debate because they’re just stupid uniformly,” Palana said.
However, student comedians on campus are making conscious efforts to ensure they are bringing new and productive material to the table. According to Dan J. Kenny ’18, editor in chief of Satire V, Harvard’s undergraduate satirical news publication, this means club-wide debates before they take on any stance on current affairs and events happening directly on campus. Members of HCSUCS hold each other accountable by going over sets before shows, not withholding any criticism if they have heard a joke before.
Toni Chan ’18, the President of Satire V, sees this self-motivation as an extension of the experimental college spirit. “Because we’re at college and everyone’s experimenting with how they write, do stand-up, and create all the different comedic forms, you see people who are willing to go beyond the really easy jokes,” she says.
Some college comics also say that they presume to be speaking to a predominantly liberal audience, which presents its own set of opportunities and challenges. “I feel very confident making fun of the political state because I assume there’s not going to be a lot of backlash. So it’s pretty easy here,” Palana said.
But even despite the temptation to continuously poke fun at the Trump administration, comedy groups on campus strive to recognize the diversity of beliefs within their own clubs and not align themselves with one viewpoint. Kenny wants to give voice to a range of perspectives, but not mechanically so. “I don’t think of it as tit-for-tat, that because we make fun of conservatives, we then have to make fun of liberals,” Kenny said. “There’s always room to make fun of the people in power, no matter what ideology.”
The intersection of comedy and politics is evidently a shared passion among these student comedians, but they also recognize the shortcomings of their work. Tess Saperstein ’18, Producer of On Harvard Time, emphasizes that political jokes, no matter how insightful, that are unaccompanied by action risk being inconsequential. “I love to make fun of all of the really, really questionable things that are going on in the world  today,” she said. “But I also need to be conscious that when you make a joke and just leave it there, you don’t actually accomplish anything. I don’t think it’s necessarily up to comedians to accomplish vast political change, but I do think that as a politically aware person myself, I feel a responsibility to do more.”

A dystopian world featuring a corrupt government and country in war-torn ruins is not a new concept, but the Theater, Dance and Media department’s production of “Far Away” aims to challenge viewers with its eerily near applicability. Based on the 2000 play by Caryl Churchill, the play revolves around a woman named Joan whose accidental discovery changes her conception of the world. “Far Away” will appear in Farkas Hall as a minimalistic drama that features only three actors.
Connor Doyle ’19, who plays main character Todd, emphasized the contemporary relevance of the play. “The show’s got a really important message that I think people need to hear today,” he said. “The future this play talks about is—I think this is part of the point—not so far away. It’s really close to home.”
Visiting professional director Annie Tippe agreed. “I want people to think about the way that art and politics interact with each other in a fresh way. And I want the audience to feel surprised by their own reactions to the play and to question their notions about how art interacts with everyday life,” she said.
The unique experience of having a professional director and a student cast and crew attracted producer Sam A. Hagen ’18 to the show. “When they asked me to produce the TDM show, I was super down just for the opportunity to collaborate with both students and professionals at the same time,” he said.
This collaboration is also what gives life to the simple script, which both provides room for interpretation and presents challenges. Enosa J. Ogbeide ’20, who plays Joan, remarked that the actors were responsible for effectively conveying the play’s message. “The lines themselves are fairly short, and you’re just not actually given very much,” she said. “I think it’s up to the actors to portray in how they act, given those said lines, the actions they are trying to get at and fill in those gaps for an audience member.”
Tippe’s directing helped them fill in the gaps and also challenged the actors to work together in doing so. Elizabeth B. H. O’Donnell ’17, who plays Harper, described the process as novel. “The amount of work we did as a group—figuring out the gaps and the story we’re telling as a group—was really new to me. Normally that’s the kind of stuff you do alone as an actor,” she said.
“Far Away” will be in Farkas Hall from April 26 to April 30.

For the last 44 years at Harvard, students have been pushing unsuccessfully for the establishment of an Ethnic Studies department at the College, submitting 11 total proposals—all of which have been rejected by the administration. Last Thursday, the History & Literature department took an important first step by creating an ethnic studies track for concentrators. We applaud this groundbreaking move towards the legitimization of ethnic studies but stress that more must be done to enhance the voices of different ethnic groups through academia.
The new ethnic studies track enables students to take eight classes in the field, in addition to six general History & Literature courses. Students can specialize in Asian American Studies, Latinx Studies, African American Studies, Indigenous Studies, and Muslim American Studies, affording them a great deal of autonomy in choosing their research topics. We are heartened by the flexibility this program grants students to pursue a course of study tailored to their interests, and we believe that the department’s focus on interdisciplinary study makes it a natural home for ethnic studies.
We suspect the realization of this new academic track is in large part a product of student activism, and we commend these groups, including the Ethnic Studies Coalition, for successfully calling attention to the need for an institutionalized ethnic studies field. It is good to see the History & Literature department respecting student perspectives, and this partnership between faculty and students to modernize and broaden scholarship is laudable.
Nevertheless, the need for Ethnic Studies remains great. In order to become thoughtful members of the global community, students should have the opportunity to think critically about the role that race and ethnicity has played in defining everything from the political landscape to the daily lives of Americans. Moreover, this department would help reflect and validate the diversity of America while exploring the nuances of cultural backgrounds, helping to elevate dialogue and build a better connected society.
We therefore believe that the full establishment of an Ethnic Studies department on campus is still necessary. This department would provide the essential resources needed to build up the program, including by hiring faculty that specializes in the field and by providing research funding. In order to effectively integrate Ethnic Studies into the academic world of Harvard, the field needs financial and administrative support—and becoming a full department would provides that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Saturdays ago, April 15, was National American Sign Language Day, a day that commemorates the 1817 establishment of the first school designed specifically for deaf students in the United States. This day embraces the often forgotten culture of the deaf, a people whose history—and current situation—consists of discrimination, isolation, and harassment.
Just this past September, Alex Hernandez, a deaf senior high school student in Nebraska, was severely bullied; two students dumped the school supplies, debit card, and cochlear implants in his backpack into a toilet, leaving him helpless during school hours. Ultimately, fellow students and, eventually, the internet, showed compassion for Alex, but these stories are all too common—especially for the deaf community.
In order to prevent more tragedies like Alex’s, the unique needs of the deaf must be recognized. Teaching American Sign Language to those who can hear is an important first step not only because it increases the hearing population’s ability to communicate with deaf people, but also because it allows them to understand the often-ignored struggles that deaf people face on a daily basis.
Thankfully, many schools across the country and in the Boston area have promoted ASL’s importance by legitimizing it academically. Boston University and Northeastern are among these, each offering potential degrees in deaf studies and hosting a multitude of events specifically designed for interactions between the hearing and the deaf. By recognizing deaf language and culture as a worthwhile academic pursuit, these schools have put their backing behind those who cannot hear.
Harvard has not.
Although Harvard offered introductory American Sign Language classes for the first time this year, the College still refuses to recognize ASL as a real language by not permitting sign language to  fulfill the mandatory language requirement. Harvard argues that, for a language to fulfill this requirement, it must have “a written component.”
At its core, the purpose of language is communication and doubting a people’s language merely because one cannot “write it” is fundamentally discriminatory. By instilling within students’ minds that ASL is a fun elective but not a legitimate language due to its failure to have a stereotypical “written component,” Harvard is essentially claiming that those who use American Sign Language are not actually using language. Harvard is positioning itself as an institution that, on the whole, does not see ASL as a “proper” form of communication.
But in reality, 100,000 to 500,000 Americans use ASL as their primary language. The argument that ASL is simply a “derivative” of English is also incorrect, as ASL is a complex language with its own unique syntactical and grammatical structures. Furthermore, deaf people have a drastically different culture from the hearing, with their own abundant literature (as a simple YouTube search will prove). ASL studies thus have the possibility to adhere to the academic norms that are often associated with other linguistic studies.
The purpose of the language requirement is to inspire students to think about the meaning of communication and to learn how to communicate in a new way. As one of the students in the new ASL class, I can confidently say that, through this course, I have challenged myself academically in an unprecedented manner. Not only have I garnered an understanding of a language that communicates in a medium like none other, I have also had the incredibly rewarding experience of learning ASL from a deaf professor. In addition, I have gained insight into a community that is largely ignored in regular academic settings. This is the true purpose of learning another language: to gain a new toolset that allows you to answer challenging problems in a new fashion and converse with those who are different from you. New languages permit you to explore your intellectual boundaries in extremely innovative ways, a feat that, no doubt, ASL allows for.
Harvard needs to end its prejudice towards the deaf community and eliminate its outdated view of language. Students who pursue ASL for a year should have the opportunity to utilize these linguistic studies to fulfill the language requirement. Any other solution is simply insulting to the deaf community and a huge embarrassment for the school. It’s time for Harvard to finally listen—and not just with their ears.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The pamphleteers outside of the Science Center are getting aggressive. They shove a colorful flyer in my face, promoting a talk being given by professors on the intersectionality of science and spirituality. “Do you believe in miracles?”
I falter. Yes? Maybe? Memories blur behind my eyes like a black and white movie reel, spinning spinning spinning. It lands on my acceptance letter. Knee-jerk reactions land in the throat and the wound begins to hemorrhage, a lump develops. Swallowing assuages this fear, caresses the thing that refuses to be anything more than dark and hard and lumpy and invulnerable into confession.
“No.”
I was shocked at my instinctual response. On a different day, I might have given a different answer. Yet, despite the fact that the words had already trickled down from my mouth, I felt their impression soft, cold on my lips. Miracles to me come in the form of watching the sun set over the Science Center Plaza while I sit on my heater, leaning against the window, thinking of all the lives I could have had where this view wasn’t in the stars. Miracles are the fire that breathes life into the impossible, that nurture the idea that a kid who couldn’t fathom adding the word “Harvard” to her daily diction now has the opportunity to watch the sun dip its toes into the horizon every twilight at that very institution. To deny myself this existence seems counterintuitive; it is an attempt to take the light away from the seam between the sky and the ground—and this feels just plain wrong.
How is it that that feeling of overwhelming joy, accomplishment, fulfillment that one finds when they open their acceptance letter can be anything other than miraculous, otherworldly? Who here would have the audacity to say they belonged here before they knew what belonging meant?
This weekend, hundreds of prefrosh flowed through the veins of campus, red lanyards, name cards, and timidity in tow. They gravitated towards one another, conglomerated around their shared awe and exhaustion and confusion. If you looked closely, past the doe-eyed and bushy-tailed glint in their smize, you can see the fear, the qualms in their step. They know how hard they’ve worked to get here—some of them might even tell you, if given the opportunity to humble brag in a non-humble way. SAT, ACT, IB, AP, NHS, CEO, IVY—give them the alphabet and they’ll give you an accomplishment, a story, a parable strung together in three letters that you’ll take home with you and hold up to the light, wondering which pattern of letters rest heavier on your own shoulders. Ask them if they think this place is still a miracle to them.
Bet the answer is still a resolute, resounding “yes.”
Focusing on the gall of my absolutist answer, however, is a bit ad hominem, missing the intent entirely. Focusing on the question of miracles itself might be a bit myopic as well. While it is completely valid to have arguments for both sides of the query without either opinion being privy to the truth, standing on either side of the line removes the possibility for one to see from the perspective of being in the middle.
If we begin to place our actions in the hands of miracles, we fail to see the light within ourselves, the desires and dedication that propel us to grind ourselves against the whetstone of the world, honing ourselves to something that, mixed with a dash of luck, places us in the paths of achieving our dreams. And in the accomplishment of such feats, in reaching out to the thing that has held our minds captive for days and weeks and years and having the ability to call it our own—this feels like a miracle. Who’s to tell you it isn’t one, you might think. But then again, you might not.
The talk given by the professors proffering the solution to this question was relatively inconclusive. Both professors said they’ve seen miracles. These are men of science that study the way in which nitrogenous base pairs come together like bodies in embrace, origami themselves in such a way that the individuality of humanity can be surmised by the expansion and contraction of said embrace. Men of science who know that a reading of these bases like a finger tracing the steps down one’s spine coupled with neuronal fireworks tremoring in roots of one’s brain gives way to the justification of every single action that has ever occurred in the history of man. These professors know this, and they still believe in miracles.
Does this answer your question?

Harvard has successfully reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent since 2006, according to a report from the Office for Sustainability.
The report, released Friday, detailed recent progress in Harvard’s efforts to reduce waste and emissions, as well as a new initiative to promote the use of environmentally-friendly materials in campus infrastructure projects.
Harvard reduced waste per capita and water use by 43 and 24 percent, respectively, against a 2006 baseline and was able to use 60 percent organic materials in landscaping. By 2020, the office hopes to reduce waste by 50 percent and water use by 30 percent. The office also aims to use 75 percent organic materials in landscaping by 2020.
In addition to drastic reductions in emissions, waste, and water use, the report said that Harvard launched a program to research and pilot the use of more sustainable building and interior design materials in construction. The program, called the Healthier Building Materials Academy, is overseen by the Office of Sustainability and partners with Harvard faculty to educate project managers on sustainable building initiatives.
“The other thing that we did in conjunction with it was becoming a founding partner in a transparency tool called Portico, which was created by Google and the Healthy Building Network,” Heather Henriksen, the Office for Sustainability’s director, said. “We’re looking at things like carpet and furniture. Are there things that we can do in partnership with Google, in partnership with higher education institutions, to move the marketplace to create healthier building materials?”
She added that the project spans several of Harvard’s schools.
“Our faculty at the School of Public Health, the Medical School, and [the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences] have been at the cutting edge of studying chemicals of concern, and indoor air quality, and the built environment,” Henriksen said.
The office also expanded the “living lab” project, which supports student-led projects in sustainability at Harvard, last year.
Henriksen said the Campus Sustainability Innovation Fund—a grant program launched in 2016 to further the living lab initiative—provides students and faculty with an opportunity to secure funding for non-traditional sustainability research.
While the sustainability report was focused on Harvard’s on-campus work, Henriksen said she hopes its results will have impact beyond the University.
“This isn’t just about making it happen on Harvard’s campus,” Henriksen said. “This is about using Harvard’s campus as a test bed, to prove that these things can happen at scale, and then releasing that data and information so that others can do it.”

An anti-affirmative action group seeking insight into Harvard’s undergraduate admissions processes has subpoenaed three more competitive high schools—in addition to Boston Latin School—in its ongoing lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian Americans.
Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, is requesting depositions from representatives of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Stuyvesant High School, and Monta Vista High School, according to a series of documents filed in court Thursday. SFFA is also requesting information from Boston Latin School, a prestigious Mass. public high school, though the school has moved to quash the subpoena.
In a motion arguing against Boston Latin School, lawyers for SFFA wrote that the four schools were subpoenaed because they rank among the top high schools in the country, send a sizeable portion of their students to top universities, and enroll a large number of Asian American students.
Thomas Jefferson, a competitive public STEM magnet school in Alexandria, Va., currently enrolls 1,843 students with 61 percent reported of Asian descent, according to U.S. News and World Report. Stuyvesant, one of nine specialized high schools in New York City, enrolls 3,293 students, of which 73 percent are Asian. Monta Vista, a public school located near Silicon Valley in Calif., enrolls 2,351 students, 78 percent of whom are of Asian descent. Boston Latin School, which enrolls 2,379 students, reports a significantly lower percentage of Asian American students at 29 percent.
All four schools subpoenaed by SFFA have consistently enrolled graduating seniors into Harvard’s freshman classes. Twenty-six members of Harvard's Class of 2020 went to Boston Latin, for example.
In its subpoenas to the high schools, SFFA requested a deposition from a school official, documentation of the racial composition of applicants and admits to Harvard, and any internal or external communications of alleged racial discrimination against Asian Americans in the college admissions process.
According to the opposition motion filed by SFFA, representatives from both Stuyvesant and Monta Vista have notified SFFA that they intend to comply with the subpoena, producing the requested information and submitting to a deposition. Currently, though, Boston Latin and Thomas Jefferson have filed motions to quash the subpoenas and are awaiting rulings.
Thomas Jefferson’s motion to quash, originally filed on Mar. 23rd in the Eastern Virginia District Court argues—similarly to Boston Latin—that the subpoena would place an “undue burden” on Thomas Jefferson and its governing school district and seeks”irrelevant information that SFFA can obtain from other sources.” Additionally, Thomas Jefferson argues that SFFA has not given the district enough time to collect and review all the information requested by the subpoena.
“It thus is unclear how or why Thomas Jefferson High School employees would have any information relevant,” Christopher T. Pickens, counsel for Thomas Jefferson, wrote in the motion.
In their opposition to Boston Latin’s request to quash the subpoena, SFFA wrote that the subpoena will not realistically place an “undue burden” on the high school and that its close ties to Harvard and large number of Asian American students makes it a useful witness to alleged discriminatory practices.
“To avoid such discrimination, counselors may advise [Asian American] students to hide their identity, to emphasize personal characteristics that avoid Asian stereotypes, and in many cases, to lower their expectations and apply elsewhere,” Patrick Strawbridge, counsel for SFFA, wrote in the motion.
Currently, the lawsuit is in the discovery period and will remain so until June 20. SFFA argues that the information requested in the four subpoenas will highlight a “key point of discovery”: the “experiences of high school guidance counselors and other school officials” who may be witness to the race-conscious admissions policy at Harvard.

Harvard University IDs will double as MBTA CharlieCards for the incoming Class of 2021 in a pilot program, the Undergraduate Council announced at their general meeting on Sunday.
While students currently have to purchase separate CharlieCards in order to ride Boston public transportation, the pilot HUID will combine the two functions into a single card. The UC launched a pilot program for 100 students in conjunction with the Harvard Office for Sustainability and Harvard Transportation and Parking in 2015.
“There’s going to be a chip placed into the incoming class of 2021’s Harvard IDs that corresponds with the CharlieCard system, so they don't need a separate CharlieCard,” said Student Life Committee Chair Katherine E. Wang ’20, an active Crimson editor, at Sunday night’s general meeting.
Although details of the project have not been officially announced, Wang said current students would likely have to purchase a new HUID if they wanted the dual CharlieCard functionality.
UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said the UC has been instrumental in pushing the administration to add the CharlieCard capacity to HUIDs.
“It was like a four or five year long project. The UC has really been in communications the entire time. So really congrats to all involved,” she said.
Former UC Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 said she remembered working on the project, which ran into headwinds due to cost and security issues raised by Harvard administrators.
“We tried to start it in the fall of 2012, because one of the freshman UC reps noticed that MIT student cards can also double as their CharlieCard,” she said. “There was just concerns about cost and that having the merge of Harvard IDs and MBTA information might lead to leaking high-security information or swipe access of Harvard cards.”
Zhu said she hoped this project inspired representatives to realize they can take initiative without relying upon the administration.
“I think it’s hard for the administration to always understand the perspective and wants and needs of students, so I think it’s fine for ideas and projects to originate from the students, as long as the administration is truly open and receptive to hearing these ideas and working with us,” she said.
“If I ever go to Harvard for grad school, I expect to use my ID for CharlieCards,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard moves to rely more on external managers and emulate an investment system in place at Yale, Yale’s Investment Office argued a strong justification of the fees it pays outside funds, directly rebutting outside criticism from some market analysts.
In its annual endowment report, the YIO criticized “fee bashers” like Warren Buffett and Malcolm Gladwell who have argued that Yale, and other clients like it, pays its investment managers too much. Yale argued that paying higher fees to funds is warranted if a the firm performs exceptionally well.
“What Buffett, Gladwell, and other fee bashers miss is that the important metric is net returns, not gross fees,” the report reads. “Performance-based compensation earned by external, active investment managers is a direct consequence of investment outperformance.”
And outperform Yale has. The report notes that Yale’s investment returns are “the highest of all colleges and universities over the past twenty and thirty years, according to Cambridge Associates,” which it says “result[s] in external managers earning large performance-based fees.”
“Weak or negative returns would result in low or no performance-related fees, but would be a terrible outcome for the University,” the report reads. 
As Harvard cuts the size of its internal workforce and begins to outsource its funds to more expensive external managers, HMC will begin to more closely resemble investment offices at Yale and other peer institutions. With a staff size of more than 30, Yale’s Investment Office’s staff is a fraction of HMC’s, which will slash roughly half of its more than 230 staffers by the end of the year. Harvard has recently looked to Yale’s investment strategies and Yale’s report offers insight into the approach Harvard may begin to take.
Yale’s report explores the considerations the school makes when setting the fees it is willing to pay its investment managers. According to the report, Yale crafts incentives that will naturally align the interests of its external managers with that of the university, in some cases relying on “material co-investment” in a fund to “create a powerful alignment of interest, especially with regard to taking appropriate levels of risk.”
Explaining its investment decisions, Yale argued that it employs an active management strategy because it “has demonstrated its ability to identify top-tier active managers that consistently generate better-than-market returns.” According to the report, some have suggested that Yale would be better served if it ceased paying higher fees to its “active managers” and invested in passive index strategies instead. In its report, Yale took a different view.
“Such strategies make sense for organizations lacking the resources and capabilities to pursue successful active management programs, a group that arguably includes a substantial majority of endowments and foundations,” the report reads. “While passive investment strategies result in low fee payments, an index approach to managing the University’s Endowment would shortchange Yale’s students, faculty, and staff, now and for generations to come.”
The recent changes at HMC followed several years of disappointing returns; in fiscal year 2016, the size of Harvard’s endowment fell by nearly $2 billion as a result of the endowment’s underperformance and other cash flows at the University.  Amid recent changes, more of HMC’s funds may fall under active outside management.
At the same time, Yale returned 3.4 percent on its investments in a year when many large institutional investors saw negative returns. At $25.4 billion, Yale’s is the third largest endowment in higher education, behind Harvard and the University of Texas.
N.P. Narvekar, the new chief executive at Harvard Management Company, wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates earlier this year announcing major overhauls at HMC and cautioning against comparing investment returns across institutions.
“There’s a natural tendency to compare annual one-year returns among universities,” Narvekar wrote. “However, different universities have different risk tolerances based on their own individual needs. Simplistic comparisons can be not only foolish, but also dangerous.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company’s head of natural resources Colin Butterfield said that Harvard is “pausing” investments in some fossil fuels at a Business School event Monday.
During the discussion on the effects of climate change on investments, Butterfield said that Harvard's natural resources portfolio will not likely invest in the fossil fuel industry in the future because those funds do not perform that well financially.
“What I can tell you is, from my area, I could honestly say that I doubt—I can’t say never, because never say never—but I doubt that we would ever make a direct investment with fossil fuels,” he said. “But that’s more of an Investment Committee decision, and I cannot talk on their behalf.”
Butterfield added that Harvard does indirectly invest in fossil fuels through outside funds. Members of the Harvard Corporation indicated in October that the University was moving away from investments in coal because they were not profitable.
Butterfield joined HMC in October 2016  to head the natural resources division of HMC, coming from a background investing in agriculture and timber. At the event, he talked about his own opinions on climate change and its impact on investments. George Serafeim, a Business School professor who does research on Environmental, Social, and Governance—“ESG”— factors to investing, moderated the conversation.
In November, Harvard Management Company set forth to “refine” its investments in natural resources, which include vineyards in California and timber yards in South America. Butterfield said that the natural resources portfolio “is not looking at energy at the moment.”
“For now, we are pausing minerals and oil and gas,” he said.
Butterfield said that climate change is “a huge problem,” and that he actively considers and thinks about it in his role at the helm of HMC’s natural resources.
“I clearly feel that we are stealing from the future generations,” he said. “When you go out there and invest in natural resources, and you start looking at what’s happening in the world of natural resources, it’s pretty scary—we need to have more of these conversations.”
Harvard’s investments in natural resources have been controversial among some student activists, who have demanded that the University divest its endowment from all fossil fuels. Harvard has repeatedly said it will not do so.
In fiscal year 2016, the value of Harvard’s natural resources assets fell by 10.2 percent. That steep decline was part of broader drop at HMC in fiscal year 2016; the value of the University’s endowment fell by almost $2 billion. 
Some members of activist group Divest Harvard attended the conversation; one student asked Butterfield about Harvard’s commitment to investing in more sustainable forms of energy and divesting from fossil fuels.
“It’s a huge concern,” Butterfield said.

Days after a National Labor Relations Board official ruled that Harvard improperly conducted a November student unionization election, union organizers are again gearing up to convince eligible students to form a union ahead of a possible re-vote.
Last week, NLRB hearing officer Thomas A. Miller wrote in a recommendation that Harvard did not conduct a fair election in November and failed to provide accurate lists of students eligible to vote in the election. Miller also recommended that 195 remaining challenged ballots from the election be opened and counted—at least 186 of these ballots would need to support unionization for the union to win.  Unless the final results favor the union, Miller wrote that a re-vote should be conducted.
Miller’s recommendation is not binding, and NLRB Regional Director John J. Walsh, Jr. will review it prior to a final decision. Either party could appeal Miller’s recommendation.
But even before the NLRB has finalized its decision, student union organizers at Harvard are preparing to launch another unionization campaign. A December vote count—which remains too close due to the unresolved challenge ballots—showed more graduate students voting against unionization than for it, albeit by a narrow margin.
Union organizer Gabe Schwartz said his role in preparing for the re-vote is to help people “decide what’s better for them.” To do this, he and other union organizers are speaking with students about what they want to see improved in graduate school.
“If they can see what they want improved, it’s easier for them to visualize how a union might help them,” he said.
Schwartz said Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers is also trying to garner support with STEM students. Schwartz said “on average” it is “probably true” that more humanities than STEM students supported unionization in the November election.
These organizing efforts come after a unionization election that has lasted months. Several delays slowed counting the ballots from the November election, when graduate student teaching fellows and research assistants and undergraduate teaching fellows cast their ballots. And objections filed days after the December vote count further complicated the process.
In February, the NLRB began hearings to consider both the objections and the validity of some of the contested ballots from the election. Miller, who presided over the hearing, wrote his recommendation based on arguments presented by each party.
The day the NLRB released the recommendation, Harvard's Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote in an email that he disagreed with the recommendation. Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana forwarded Curran’s email to GSAS students.
“The University believes strongly that the votes and voices of students should be respected and that the election results should stand,” Curran wrote. “We believe that a new election, as these findings provisionally recommend, ignores the majority of students who voted against unionization and is unwarranted by the facts.”
Both sides could appeal Miller’s recommendation to Region 1 of the NLRB—the region overseeing Harvard’s case—and then possibly to the full NLRB in Washington.
In his email, Curran wrote Harvard “will thoroughly review the hearing officer’s report to determine appropriate next steps.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Manager unveiled a roughly $600 million budget proposal for fiscal year 2018 that will expand funding for supporting undocumented Cambridge residents among other initiatives, at the City Council’s meeting Monday night.
The budget, which is the first City Manager Louis A. DePasquale has proposed, increases spending in a number of areas.
“Here are some highlights: the FY18 operating budget is $605 million, which is a 4.97 percent increase over the 2017,” Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said. “Included in the budget is a 2.5 percent Cost of Living increase for employees [and] a 5.8 percent increase in pensions [for employees].”
DePasquale said he aimed to involve the City Council early on in the budget crafting process.
“One of the things I heard going through the City Manager’s process was ‘get the city council involved early.’” DePasquale said. “I think we’ve done a really good job in reflecting what we feel the priorities of the City Council are.” 
Later at the City Council meeting Monday, Councillors discussed an ordinance proposal to make it easier for City departments to request funds for surveillance technology. Cambridge residents at the meeting criticized the proposal, with some raising concerns about mass-surveillance on the part of the City government.
Responding to the concerns, DePasquale said that the ordinance was a preliminary suggestion and that Councillors needed to work on it more with and the ordinance committee. He said the public would have plenty of opportunities to influence the legislation.
“We want to get to the same place” DePasquale said. “We just want to get to a place that’s workable for all of us.”
Also discussed was a proposal allowing MIT researchers to install test sensors along Massachusetts Ave. for the purpose of “observing the behavior of pedestrians, cyclist, and drivers...reporting on parking occupancy/availability, and measuring air quality.”
Councillors were split over the decision to support the test. Councillors Nadeem A. Mazen and Jan Devereux spoke out in support of the sensors as a state of the art way to improve the city with the help of a local entity; McGovern and City Councillor Craig A. Kelley said that Councillors were not provided information on the sensors in a timely matter and that process needed to be established.
At the meeting, Councillors allocated more than $5 million in funding for various fire deparment accounts and improvements at Cambridge firehouses. They also also appropriated more than $4 million in grant money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to various city human services funds, including funds designed to provide housing for homeless and vulnerable populations in Cambridge.

In Providence, R.I., Harvard softball (18-16, 9-6 Ivy) stayed in contention for an Ivy League Championship Series bid as it swept Brown (13-27, 3-12) in a three-game weekend series, putting the Crimson second in the Ivy North Division behind only Dartmouth (11-24-1, 10-6).
The three victories extended Harvard’s Ivy League winning streak to five consecutive games. The Crimson’s away record improved to 7-5 as well.
“We stuck to our process and had faith in ourselves and each other to get the job done,” sophomore catcher Nicole Nishizawa said.
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
In the final game in Rhode Island, Harvard continued its winning streak with a 5-2 win against the Bears.
The second game of the series was not as smooth as the earlier game, as the Crimson and Brown were stuck in a 2-2 tie going into the sixth inning. Sophomore catcher Elizabeth Shively led off the top of the sixth with a double. A sacrifice bunt moved her over to third, but she was unable to score on a subsequent groundout, the second out of the frame.
Bears pitcher Meghan Wimmer’s control faltered after the groundout, as she hit sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer and allowed a free pass to sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich. Junior right fielder Maddy Kaplan capitalized on the bases-loaded opportunity, driving a double to center field to give Harvard a 5-2 advantage.
“The biggest thing that made us successful today was definitely clutch hitting,” Shively said. “We really stuck with the process today and battled every at-bat.”
The Crimson would hold the score with a strong performance by sophomore pitcher Kathleen Duncan, who struck out seven batters to defend the Harvard lead, as well as two strikeouts from freshman starter Olivia Giaquinto. The pair only allowed eight hits, one base on ball, and two earned runs in seven innings.
The Crimson opened the scoring once again with two runs in the second inning. Singles by Schiffhauer and Rich allowed Harvard to jump out to a 2-0 lead.
Brown fought back in the third inning to level the game at 2-2, and coach Jenny Allard opted to bring Duncan in to evade the scoring threat. The sophomore tossed 4.1 scoreless innings to improve her record to 7-6.
“We kept our energy up in the dugout and on the field,” Shively said. “We were really cheering for one another the whole time, and it was like we had 23 other girls behind us the whole game.”
HARVARD 4, BROWN 0
In the first game on Sunday, the Crimson rolled comfortably past the Bears with impressive performances from all players.
Rich opened the first inning with a walk before freshman first baseman Olivia Giaquinto hit a single to plate the El Segundo, Calif. native. The strong performances continued as Nishizawa hit an infield single to allow Harvard to run to a 2-0 lead. Giaquinto and Nishizawa led the team offensively, driving in three and one runs, respectively.
As the second inning began, the Crimson built up to a 4-0 lead after Giaquinto hit a single with the bases loaded and two outs allowing two more runs to cross home plate. The offense came out strong in the opening game against Brown with Rich, Kaplan, junior left fielder Dallas Hogan, and sophomore third baseman Erin Lockhart all stealing bases.
“We had some people really step up in big situations, but it wouldn’t have been possible if our pitchers and defense hadn’t done such a good job of keeping them off the bases,” Shively said.
Harvard didn’t score for the other innings but held its lead for the rest of the game with a standout performance by senior pitcher Taylor Cabe.
The Boiling Springs, S.C. native pitched a two-hit shutout, allowed only two hits, and struck out five batters. In the first six innings, Cabe only allowed two baserunners. The senior wrapped up her phenomenal game by stranding two runners in the bottom of the seventh.
HARVARD 7, BROWN 4
The Crimson rallied for five runs in the top of the seventh inning to post a come-from-behind win in the opening game of the weekend series.
Trailing 4-2 at the start of the seventh, Harvard erupted for four hits and benefited from two errors to put five runs on the board. Kaplan got the inning started with a rare catcher’s interference, and she later scored on a squeeze bunt from Shively. Schiffhauer singled in Lockhart to tie the game, and Nishizawa tacked on two more with a double into the gap in right-center. Later, Hogan reached on a throwing error, and Schiffhauer crossed the plate to put the Crimson on top, 7-4.
Nishizawa had a breakout game, going 3-for-4 at the plate and driving in four of Harvard’s seven runs. Schiffhauer and Giaquinto added two hits each.
The Crimson was aggressive on the basepaths against Bears catcher Julia Schoenewald. Kaplan, Hogan, and co-captain Giana Panariello each had a stolen base.
Duncan put together a solid start in the circle, throwing five innings and giving up two earned runs. Cabe entered in the sixth and held Brown scoreless in the final two frames.

There’s no denying that the Harvard brand is the pinnacle of collegiate glory. As ubiquitous as Apple and Starbucks (ironically two favorites of Harvard students) and as old—older than, actually— as JP Morgan Chase, another student favorite, our college’s logo is affixed to every kind of merch on the market. So it’s no surprise that our lionized university is invoked in popular culture more often than any other academic institution in the world. While literally every piece of media drop the H bomb sooner or later, we’ve compiled the most noteworthy mentions of the most hip and relevant University on the planet. We apologize in advance for flexin’.
The Simpsons 
Unsurprisingly, Harvard has been mentioned a couple dozen times on this classic. After all, ten percent of television’s full time humour writers hail from our hallowed gates. Our absolute favorite Harvard reference? Lisa’s burn that left the Harvard rejects’ pile in shambles in “Barthood.”
Bart: Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?
Lisa: Yeah, I do! I'm going to Yale!
WE’RE ABSOLUTELY SHOOK
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend
The protagonist of this binge-worthy comedy, Rebecca Bunch has done everything on the Harvard student’s bucket list: she’s written for The Crimson (something you should all do), worked for a prestigious New York law firm, and was even “rhythmically trashed by a junior visiting from the Brown improv troupe” on the night of the Dunster House formal. Despite her, shall we say inclination, for donning a Harvard sweatshirt to yoga and just generally name dropping our alma mater a tad too much, we still recognize ourselves in this lovable broken mess of an overachiever.
BoJack Horseman
The writers of this Netflix original clearly have some beef with the Lampoon. Not one but two characters are mentioned to have “written” for the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Just as expected, these personas— the awkward nepotistic intern Charlie and the pretentious Cuddlywhiskers—are just as awful (very realistic) as the real deal.
30 Rock
Staffed by a slew of “hyper intelligent Harvard boys,” 30 Rock basically came for our lives by taking a jab at our pretentious use of Harvard lingo in “Plan B”:
Liz: What did you major in?
Toofer: Sorry?? I don’t understand?? Oooooh I seeeee, (condescending mode activated) at Harvard we call them concentrations.
Scream Queens 
This trashy comedy takes pretentiousness to a whole new level by portraying a Harvard-educated doctor losing his hand while trying to save his class ring from a bristly demise in his garbage disposal. He didn’t suffer through all those all nighter for nothing—he definitely had to have something to show it, and a degree from Harvard Medical School just wasn’t enough. Talk about school spirit #gocrimson.
People vs. OJ Simpson
We all know that guy with whom “every eighth word coming out of his mouth is Harvard.” Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, one of the original “dream team” members, was apparently one of these guys #noshade.
Bonus round
We know you expected “Legally Blonde,” “Love Story,” and the “Social Network” to make the cut, but with two of these iconic Harvard movies being shown during the opening days, you already know what they’re all about. What, like it’s hard?

It’s almost summer (fingers crossed), and that can only mean one thing: darty season. Whether you’re looking to enjoy the end of spring on campus instead of studying for finals, or you’re looking ahead to post-finals freedom, we see a few darties in your future. We love a good darty, but like everything in life, there are tradeoffs.
Pro: Think of the possibilities…
The daytime allows for a lot more excitement in terms of party themes and activities. We’re talking pool parties, barbeques (who doesn’t love to chill and grill?), and maybe even some spike ball (or Frisbee throwing—both equally amazing bro activities).
Con: No time for homework, or literally anything else
We don’t like to admit it, but we go to Harvard, and most of us are try-hards. A darty takes up most of the day and renders the rest of the day useless due to the post-darty daze. We like to stick to parties at night so that we can spend the day grinding through psets.
Pro: New frontier of party outfits
Did someone say Coachella? There’s something special about outfits on hot summer days that just can’t be replicated at night—we’re talking crochet crop tops and bucket hats—so darties help us diversify our party fashion. Do it for the Instagram, as they say, since Vine is dead.
Con: Actually dead by 8 p.m.
If you went to Yardfest (and began drinking mid-afternoon), you know exactly what we’re talking about. It’s very hard to rally once the alcohol and adrenaline wears off, so the choice to darty is the choice to not party that night. You’d hate to miss out on the fun the evening could hold because you passed out just after sunset.
Pro: More sunlight=more tanning time
It’s productive to make friends, have fun, and get tanned all at the same time, right? For those of us looking to replace our winter selves with a glossier, sun-kissed summer version, the darty is the ideal place to wear minimal clothing and get maximal sun exposure.
Con: We can’t rely on Boston weather
Since we’re still struggling to battle through a few cold days in April, how can we expect to have weather good enough for a darty? It’s impossible to plan a darty in advance because we can’t know if it’ll be 80 degrees and sunny or thunder-snowing, which can be quite the deal breaker for a good darty.
The jury is still out on this form of partying, but we recommend that you check one out for yourself before loving or hating darties altogether.

With the pitiful range of options at HUDS, a big appetite, and a small budget, life is hard out here for a gluten free college gal. While my allergy prevents me from devouring Noch’s or Kong, luckily, Harvard Square presents a variety of eateries which cater to a gluten-free diet. Here are my top picks, all of which I’ve sampled these past two semesters:
For Pizza - Just Crust
Just Crust takes the prize with its goldilocks greasiness, thinner crust, and overall texture and taste. Often gluten-free dough falls between the extremes of burnt-and-bland cardboard or undercooked cardboard, but Just Crust gets it just right. Places like Domino’s and Otto’s only offer full gluten free pizzas, usually with disappointing diameters and for upwards of $13. Just Crust, on the other hand, allows one to satisfy their pizza cravings at a cheaper per-slice price.
For Mexican - Border Cafe
Corn tortillas or chips naturally do not contain wheat, making Mexican places normally a typically safe option for gluten-free folks. Unfortunately, square favorites like Felipe’s and Jefe’s contaminate these options by sharing surfaces and fryers with flour tortillas, making them iffy or dangerous for those with allergies. But Border Cafe takes extra care with preparing your food, so you can be sure your corn tortilla tacos are good to go. Most importantly, the overflowing baskets of still-warm chips brought to your table throughout the meal are fried separately, so you don’t have to feel too guilty about filling up before you’ve even looked at the menu. An honorable mention goes to Chipotle, which falls in “Mexican” territory but is really in a league of its own.
For a Sit-Down Dinner - Beat Brasserie
Favorite dishes include “Luxe” pulled-pork nachos, shrimp tacos, and ‘Fall Off the Bone’ baby back ribs. With pricier menu items, dim lighting, and live music, it’s the perfect spot to have your parents or friends treat you to on a special occasion.
For Dessert - J.P. Lick’s
Most J.P. Lick’s ice cream flavors are naturally gluten-free, and its cheery atmosphere and proximity can’t be beat. Everyone, your non gluten-free friends included, likes J.P. Licks, so you can accommodate your dietary needs (yes, ice cream is a need) and won’t have to force your gluten-eating friends out of their comfort zone. An honorable mention goes to Sweet Bakery, which always has a couple gluten free options like cupcakes or brownies, brought in from dedicated gluten-free facilities.
And if you’re feeling adventurous...check out these places ~beyond Harvard square~
Mr. Crepe - Davis Square
Gluten free sweet and savory crepes!
Tavern in the Square - Central Square, Porter Square
Clearly marked “gf” menu items include nachos, fancy pizzas, burgers and sandwiches with gluten free buns, and safely-fried french fries, tater tots, and onion rings!
Thelonius Monkfish - Central Square
This fancier restaurant, which fuses a sushi bar with a jazz bar, has an extensive gluten-free menu, boasting fried rices with gluten-free soy sauce and rich Pad Thai.
Al Dente - North End
Gluten-free pasta and bread are hard to come by, and this authentic Italian restaurant offers both!
