After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven minutes into the premiere episode of “Big Little Lies,” two of the four main characters meet. Their first exchange sounds like something out of an unexceptional children’s book: “Well, I’m Madeline Martha MacKenzie! I always say the Martha, but no one calls me that! They call me Madeline,” Reese Witherspoon chirps. “I’m Jane, Jane No-Middle-Name Chapman,” Shailene Woodley responds with a halfhearted curtsy. It’s difficult to ignore the fact that her teenage roles are far too recent for her to play the mother of a seven-year-old in HBO’s newest miniseries.
And just like that, the two women become fast friends. It might appear at this point in the episode that “Big Little Lies” is just another lackluster television show about rich white wine moms who sit around spreading rumors all day. However, the scene’s moodily subdued color scheme and the preceding flash-forward clip of police cars and witness interviews may remind the viewer that these wine moms will soon find themselves embroiled in a murder. The show’s premise hinges on the seeming incongruity of gossipy mothers and violent crime. But the real mismatch is between the show’s stunning visual beauty and its subpar writing and acting.
“Big Little Lies” introduces main characters whose lives are so picturesque that there has to be something deeply disturbing brewing beneath the surface. The first episode hints at the turmoil the characters are facing behind the closed doors of their Monterey beachfront mansions: Madeline is jealous of her ex-husband’s beautiful and bohemian new wife; Celeste Wright (a vaguely Lana Del Rey-looking Nicole Kidman) may be suffering domestic abuse; and Jane’s young son—Ziggy—has been accused of brutally choking the daughter of Renata Klein (Laura Dern). Presumably, these tensions will eventually escalate to the point of murder, though the chain of events remain unclear. For now, the viewer is given a glimpse only into the four mothers’ day-to-day drama, which, with the exception of the startling violence committed against Renata’s daughter, seems contrived and clichéd.
The show’s surprisingly talented young actors provide some of its best moments. Ziggy (Iain Armitage), for instance, effortlessly embodies a combination of innocent (“Shouldn’t we make sure the lady’s okay?”) and unsettling (sleepwalking). Viewers may wonder about his true nature: Is his classmate falsely accusing Ziggy of violence or is he actually a seven-year-old who tries to strangle little girls? While Woodley delivers her painfully heavy-handed lines (“You guys are right... And for some reason that makes me feel wrong.”) rather unimpressively, Ziggy lends substance to his mother’s flatness.
But while the children’s unexpectedly competent performances made the show more watchable, the masterful cinematography merely drew attention to its blandness in all other regards. Director Jean-Marc Vallée, the mind behind critically acclaimed films like “Dallas Buyers Club” and “Wild,” fills the backdrop of his characters’ melodrama with vibrant sunsets and ocean views so breathtaking that they almost distract from the actors’ stilted lines and largely uninspired performances—but they also leave the viewer wondering why Vallée couldn’t devote more resources to the script or its execution.
Though “Big Little Lies” is lacking in substance, it suffers no shortage of style. Still, in the interests of efficiency, it might be more advisable to look to Instagram for pretty beachside views.

Forty days. No Chainsmokers, Luke Bryan, Fall Out Boy, Beyoncé, Rhett Walker, or even Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald. No Broadway musicals, no Disney sing-a-longs, no La La Land. Et cetera.
The rule: no secular music with lyrics. I certainly wasn’t going to ask the varsity strength and conditioning coaches to turn on Gregorian chants during our rugby workouts, but any music that I chose to listen to had to follow that rule.
I undertook this endeavor last year in observance of the Christian holiday of Lent, and will be doing the same thing starting today. Forty days of self-denial and self-discipline are an exercise in repentance and spiritual growth, and culminate in the celebration of Easter. Giving up pervasive pop culture earworms seemed more meaningful and spiritual than, say, giving up Chipotle, even given my undying love for burrito bowls.
A local Christian radio station I grew up listening to regularly challenged its listeners to listen to nothing but Christian music for a month, promising it would change your life. I’ll admit that I was skeptical about this claim. The music snob in me chafed at the prospect of listening to only slightly different four-chord songs on repeat, and decided that jazz and classical tunes would be permissible.
Listening to music is a cultural liturgy in the same way that reading the Bible is a Christian liturgy, and the liturgies we practice invariably shape and permeate our deepest selves. We put on the headphones when we walk to class, focus before the big game, break out the textbooks, or turn up the speakers at the party. It is precisely because rhythm and harmony and groove are so powerful that the messages they accompany resonate so deeply.
Our listening habits do more than release dopamine or produce adrenaline in our bodies; they shape our very essence at a level deeper than our beliefs and values. The effect of musical liturgy doesn’t lie in musical merit, or how music makes us “feel,” it lies in the messages that we don’t always perceive.
It is easy to see toxicity in the lyrics of gyrating pop anthems that celebrate sex, drugs, alcohol-saturated escapades, or unhealthy relationships. The problem is not that we mimic or endorse this behavior because we listen to lyrics about it.
Instead, our brains and our souls are battered with an endless barrage of language whose messages of temporal pleasures or relationship despair offer no lasting hope or peace, no purpose. Seemingly upbeat, “catchy” dance numbers can make us “feel” optimistic and fun, while also serving as destructive liturgies that breed subtle hopelessness and apathy. These songs aren’t only to be found in this decade. From disco anthems to 90’s one-hit wonders to diner crooners, the messages haven’t changed much in recent memory.
Even the best-intentioned and best-performed love songs can ingrain profound loneliness. Somewhere, somehow, we learn to pine for a lover we don’t know or don’t have, because our minds necessarily turn to thoughts of someone else when we hear about love and heartbreak. The liturgy of that kind of song, which seems omnipresent in the Western musical canon, tells you that you aren’t enough. You, as an individual, are not enough, you are incomplete. You need someone else.
There are a few of those self-validating “Fight Song” I’m-fine-on-my-own type numbers, but for every one of those there are many more crying for or lamenting our imagined other halves. We are drowning in liturgies that remind us of our loneliness. Furthermore, for those of us lucky enough to have landed a relationship, the same liturgies tell us that our worth and happiness are understood only with respect to the relationship.
In the end, the radio station was right. A 40-day respite from pop culture worked wonders for me. I had never felt more free, more hopeful, or more at peace on an Easter Sunday than I did last year. That some of my most difficult days at Harvard transpired within that Lenten period only made the result more uplifting.
Spending more time than usual listening to jazz and classical standards reminded me of what I loved most about music. During Lent, music became intentional instead of habitual, and the tonal colors and auditory delights of my favorite standards became even more vibrant. In a void created by absent lyrics, all that remains is the actual music.
Most importantly, listening to nothing but Christian lyrics forced me to get up close and personal with myself and with my faith. From hymns, chants, and spirituals, to modern pop, rap, and electronic worship, Christian lyricism is obviously quite intentional in its efforts to bring its listeners closer to Christ. Listening to these lyrics exclusively did more than just encourage me; it renewed my faith.
I eagerly undertake this again this Lenten period. It seems strange in this world that self-imposed restrictions and self-denial could be fruitful grounds for freedom and fulfillment. Yet the intention of Lent is to reject the things of this world in order to experience another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a gross violation of students’ rights, the Trump administration announced on Feb. 22 that it would eviscerate former President Obama’s executive order allowing transgender students to use bathrooms and other facilities that correspond with their gender identity. We condemn the current administration’s move to draw students in the public education system into a political dogfight over transgender rights. Forcing transgender students to use facilities that are incongruous with their identity is not only a violation of their fundamental rights but also a significant safety risk.
No student should have to feel any anxiety or stress over such a basic need as a bathroom. Public schools are, at their core, places that foster growth and learning. By barring transgender students from expressing their gender identity, the Trump administration has decreased the probability they will be able to go about their school days normally. President Trump’s policy prohibits gender-nonconforming students from receiving an education unimpeded by fear of retribution from their schools for their self-expression—an education that all students deserve.
In removing students’ access to bathrooms that correspond with their gender identities, the Trump administration has also validated the rhetoric of conservative anti-transgender activists, who claim that President Obama’s executive order would have heightened the risk of sexual assault in schools. This claim, however, has little basis in fact and perpetuates a myth that transgender individuals are sexually violent. In reality, denying students the right to express themselves and forcing gender-nonconforming students into a controversial political conversation only serves to further ostracize an already-vulnerable group.
The administration’s actions suggest that civil rights are at risk during Trump’s presidency. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a controversial figure who has previously been criticized for his poor record on civil rights issues, has proudly supported the revocation of transgender protections in schools. Furthermore, although Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos initially told Trump she could not support the executive order, she was overruled. Secretary DeVos failed in her obligation to keep the students that she is responsible for safe. We find the behavior of Trump’s administration, and especially Attorney General Sessions and Secretary DeVos, condemnable.
In light of this concerning news, Harvard’s public support for BGLTQ students is praiseworthy. We particularly applaud Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, the Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, for sending out an email confirming the University’s commitment to preserving the rights of the LGBTQ community. We implore more visible University administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, to show their public support for such students. Harvard students, professors, and administrators alike must take a stand any time the Trump administration seeks to abridge basic civil rights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donald Trump is nothing new. His ilk have been around since the inception of democracy, and since then they have wrought havoc on democratic societies. Our ancient forebears have warned us about them in no uncertain terms. When the demagogue Cleon rose to power in Athens, the cradle of Western democracy, the ancient sources were explicit about the danger he posed, testifying to future generations of the necessity of opposing such figures. And yet, Cleon rises again and again to terrorize democratic societies. Now, he occupies the Oval Office.
After the death of the visionary leader Pericles, Cleon achieved political supremacy through the textbook tactics of demagoguery, flattering the people and promising them small benefits as distractions from the corruption of his regime and the calamity of his policies. “I can fool the [Demos, the people,] any way I please,” says the character of Cleon in Aristophanes’s play “The Knights”. “I know what food he is accustomed to.” In return for the scraps and empty promises they received, the people followed Cleon blindly.
Now Donald Trump offers worthless promises about a border wall, a ban on Muslims, or making America win so much we’ll get tired of winning. In the process, he insults whole nations, ethnicities, and religions; tramples on the civil and human rights of immigrants and refugees; and does nothing to address the real problems facing the country. Yet his promises won him the presidency and still receive support from millions of Americans.
Cleon also used the Peloponnesian War (Athens’s great war with Sparta) to shore up popular support. By riling up the Athenians against an enemy, he could unite them behind himself. Now Trump uses apocalyptic and deeply misleading rhetoric about crime, immigrants, Muslims, and the economy to create a climate of existential fear in which he positions himself as the sole source of salvation.
Why did Cleon want power? For power’s sake, no doubt, but also to enrich himself. The comedies of Aristophanes are replete with accusations that Cleon embezzled money from the state coffers and perpetuated the war to extort money from weaker cities.
In just his first three weeks in power, Donald Trump has created  countless financial conflicts of interest; White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Ivanka Trump’s product line; Eric Trump cost taxpayers nearly $100,000 on a business trip to Uruguay; Trump’s travel ban notably excluded every Middle Eastern country where the Trump Organization does business; Trump hosted Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort, giving it free international publicity; and questions fester about the extent of his business ties to Russia. The mixing of public power with the accumulation of private wealth was a hallmark of ancient tyrants and demagogues, and the pattern evidently persists today.
Cleon and Trump have also demonstrated the same weakness: a thin-skinned inability to endure ridicule. Aristophanes wrote play after play mercilessly mocking Cleon, driving Cleon into a rage and even prompting him to sue Aristophanes. Trump has shown a furious obsession with Saturday Night Live's portrayal of him and his administration, becoming upset about each new skit. He has also, like Cleon, sued a comedian who mocked him: Bill Maher.
Most striking, however, is Cleon and Trump’s shared disregard for the norms which form the bedrock of the democratic process. Plutarch describes Cleon’s worst sin, saying, “Cleon stripped the bema of its decorum, setting the fashion of yelling when he harangued the people ... He thus imbued the managers of the city's policies with that levity and contempt for propriety which soon after confounded the whole state.”
Trump’s mockery of a disabled reporter, his condescending midnight tweets, his disparagement of critics and the media, his casual incitements to violence at rallies, his lewd remarks about women, his attacks on federal judges, his unending boasting and unparalleled hyperbole, his pathological mendacity, and even his tendency to speak in rambling or incomplete sentences all subvert the basic standards of civil discourse necessary for the healthy functioning of a democratic society. He has stripped the American bema of its decorum, and the nation risks being confounded.
The uncanny resemblance between Cleon and Trump is a shrieking alarm bell. Cleon’s reign was disastrous for Athens. His “Athens First” policies anticipated Trump’s “America First” platform: He prolonged the Peloponnesian War in the hopes of Athenian domination and harshly treated subject cities in Athens’s empire, leading to Athenian defeat. He also replaced bluster with wisdom in the deliberations of the Assembly, enabling additional power-hungry demagogues to rise to prominence and sustain Athens’s decline after his death.
Athens never regained the power it once held. It was surpassed first by Sparta, then Thebes. Athenian democracy returned, but the damage to Athenian power had already been done. Like the rest of the city-states, weakened by almost constant warring, Athens finally lost the independence it had enjoyed since its foundation to the conquering armies of Macedon.
Will the United States go the way of Athens, unable or unwilling to stop a demagogue from undermining its democracy and ruining its international power? Will liberal democracies go the way of the independent Greek city-states, crippled by internal chaos and nationalist tensions? These questions are too big to answer by analogy, but analogy demands that they be asked.
History sings to us of the triumphs and follies of civilization, bearing the combined wisdom of millennia of human experience. At this moment, it screams at us to heed its warnings. Yet there are none so deaf as those who will not hear.

To a chorus of cheers, screams, and a standing ovation from students, international pop star Rihanna accepted the Harvard Foundation’s 2017 Humanitarian of the Year Award in a packed Sanders Theatre.
Though Rihanna, who originally hails from Barbados, is best known for her eight Grammy awards and perennial presence near the top of the charts, it was her philanthropic and humanitarian work that won recognition from the Foundation.
“I think we were really struck by Rihanna’s contributions to education and health care in the Caribbean, particularly her home country of Barbados,” said Avni Nahar ’17, an intern at the Foundation. "The way that she has really used her platform to advocate for change and for resources for people who need them.”
Rihanna began her humanitarian work when, as an 18-year-old, she founded the Believe Foundation to support terminally ill children. Today, one of Rihanna’s best-known humanitarian ventures is the Clara Lionel Foundation, named for her late grandmother. The foundation supports educational and health-orientated causes, like donating money towards global scholarships and funding a state-of-the-art oncology center at a hospital in Barbados.
Rihanna has also formed a partnership between Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen and served as an ambassador for UNICEF’s Tap Project.
The award ceremony included a performance by the Kuumba Singers, a welcome from Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, student tributes to Rihanna’s humanitarian work, and an address by Rihanna herself.
“Before I start with the mission of the College, I just have to say, ‘woah’,” a starstruck Khurana said before beginning his remarks.
The guest of honor was also in high spirits.
“I made it to Harvard,” Rihanna said. “I never thought I would be saying that but it feels pretty good.”
In her address accepting the award, Rihanna challenged audience members to make a commitment to helping “at least one person.”
“In this room, I see optimism, I see hope, I see the future” she said. “All you need to do is help one person and expect nothing in return. To me that is humanitarianism.”
Rihanna’s appearance on campus was met with enthusiasm from students. Students began lining up in front of Memorial Hall at 10 a.m. to secure tickets for the event that were released at noon.
“I waited in line for an hour,” said Ruiqi He ’19. “I have a midterm, but I still waited.”
Students cited Rihanna’s fashion sense, feminism, and music as motivation behind attending the ceremony.
“She’s been able to stay on top of the music industry for so many years, so I really admire that” said Shannon S. Lytle ’17.
The Harvard Humanitarian Award is given each year in the name of Reverend Peter J. Gomes as a way to honor exceptional efforts in humanitarian works. Past recipients have included gender rights activist Malala Yousafzai, singer Lionel Richie, and Delores Huerta, a farmworker rights activist.
Later this week, the Harvard Foundation will honor Academy Award-winning actress Viola Davis as the Foundation’s Artist of the Year at their Cultural Rhythms festival.

After this semester, Computer Science professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 will teach only two more semesters before he officially retires on July 1, 2020.
When he retires, Lewis will have been on the faculty at Harvard for 46 years, a span which includes an eight-year stint as Dean of the College. He joined the faculty in 1974 after receiving his PhD in applied mathematics, becoming a professor of computer science in 1981. He has taught computer science ever since. While Lewis is not retiring until July 2020, he will teach only in the spring of 2019 and 2020 after the current semester.
Lewis said the details of his departure are typical for tenured faculty considering retirement.
“Harvard has a way of encouraging tenured faculty to think about retirement who otherwise might hang around forever, and so they provide an incentive if you retire by a certain age—then they give you some extra leave terms at the end,” Lewis said. “But if you wait too long, then the incentive goes away. I’m actually a little short of the age where I would have to worry about that, but that’s why there’s this long drawn out process where you go half time for a couple of years before you actually retire.”
Lewis regularly teaches “CS20: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science” and “CS121: Introduction to the Theory of Computation,” though he will no longer teach either class after this semester. Instead, for his last two semesters, he will teach an entirely new class.
“I’ve counted, I’ve taught CS121 about, I think, 32 times— it wasn’t originally called CS121, but it’s been essentially the same course since I created it back in the late 70s sometime,” Lewis said. “So I’m going to teach a cool new course next year: ‘Classic Papers of Computer Science,’ the papers every computer scientist should have read. I’ve had a fun time putting that syllabus together, and I’ll be doing that the next two spring semesters.”
Lewis will also be stepping down from his role as the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Computer Science Department at the end of this semester, a role he said has taken up much of his time in recent years.
During the fall semesters when he is not teaching, Lewis said he will primarily use the free time to work on other academic projects.
“I’ve got about three book projects that I’ve had in the queue for a long time, so I’m glad to have some time to get some writing done,” he said. “And, you know, I have grandchildren maybe I’ll get to see a little more of.”
Over his long tenure, Lewis has been closely involved with administrative matters in addition to his academic responsibilities. As Dean of the College, he oversaw House randomization. He served as interim dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences before Francis J. Doyle III, the school’s current dean, was appointed.
Most recently, Lewis has been a vocal critic of  Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s policy penalizing involvement in single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations. In January, he withdrew an opposing faculty motion following an announcement of a committee that could “revise or replace” the sanctions.
Lewis said he will continue to be involved at Harvard after he retires.
“I’m not moving to Florida or anything like that. I’m sure that, like a lot of emeritus faculty, I’ll continue to be around.”

Leaders of five major political activism organizations came together at an Institute of Politics panel Tuesday to encourage attendees to mobilize against the Trump administration’s policies.
Hosted by Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, the all-woman panel event—called “Leaders of ‘The Resistance’”—included founders and organizers of several political action groups including Vote.org and Indivisible.
Panel moderator Meighan M. Stone, an Entrepreneurship Fellow at the Shorenstein Center and president of the Malala Fund, began the event by sharing a clip from CNN depicting town hall protests across the country.
Panelist Leah Greenberg said proliferation of town hall protests prompted the formation of her organization Indivisible, a non-profit website that aims to engage protesters and activists in the style of the Tea Party under former president Barack Obama's administration.
“There’s no question that Donald Trump is a unifying force in the sense that he’s unifying a lot of people against him,” Greenberg said. “I think that there is a danger at the same time to treating Trump as ahistorical and discounting the conditions that led to and enabled and drove his rise.”
Andrea E. Hailey, founder of the Civic Engagement Fund, compared efforts by the panelists to what she saw as outdated tactics by Democratic Party.
“We have a strategy in the Democratic Party of putting a lot of money into TV dollars…only 23 percent of millennials get their information from TV,” Hailey said. “Well, if we’re only communicating on TV,  then we have a problem there.”
After playing a clip of a pitch that panelist and Vote.org founder Debra Cleaver gave during a conference, Stone asked Cleaver about her plans to mitigate potential voter drop-off between 2016 and 2018. Cleaver described what it takes to turn someone into a lifetime voter.
“You get someone to vote in a presidential election, and then you get them to vote again in the very next midterm election, and then you don’t need to chase them anymore,” Cleaver said.
Amanda Litman, co-founder of youth political recruitment organization Run for Something, took the opportunity to encourage audience members to serve on their city council or other local positions and highlighted the lack of representation of racial minorities and women in politics.
“One of the things I’ve heard a lot from especially young women and people of color is ‘I’m not qualified, my resume’s not good enough, who am I to ask for votes from people?’” Litman said. “Donald Trump is president—you can serve on your city council.
"You are smarter, and a better listener, and a harder worker than the President of the United States,” she added.

N.P. Narvekar, the chief executive of Harvard Management Company, will receive nearly $6 million in compensation from the University per year over the next three years as he works to lift Harvard’s investment arm out of a multi-year returns slump, according to the Wall Street Journal.
His pay package will be one of the highest for any endowment CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported this figure. Emily Guadagnoli, a spokesperson for HMC, declined to comment for this story.
Narvekar became CEO of HMC in December and has already instituted several major changes to the firm, including laying off half the its staff by the end of the calendar year. According to Bloomberg, 57 individuals are expected to begin departing the firm in April.
Historically, HMC’s CEOs have been well compensated. When she was CEO of HMC, Jane Mendillo received nearly $14 million in compensation in fiscal year 2014 and the first six months of fiscal year 2015. While he was head of public market, Stephen Blyth, who served as CEO of HMC for 18 months, received $8 million in calendar year 2014.
HMC’s executive compensation structure has been the subject of scrutiny in recent years as alumni from two separate classes have directly criticized the firm’s payouts to its managers.
A group of alumni of from the Class of 1969 penned a letter to University administrators earlier this winter, calling on Harvard to stop the “unjustifiable” salaries. Most recently, a group of alumni from the Class of 1981 sent University President Drew G. Faust a letter describing concerns over the high compensation levels amid HMC’s poor returns.
According to a message sent to Harvard affiliates by Narvekar a month ago, the firm will severely restructure its internal management team, cutting the majority of them by the end of the fiscal year and moving to retain outside managers to handle its assets.

Two former Harvard Law School administrators face felony charges after allegedly stealing funds from a Law School account while employees there several years ago.
The defendants, Margaret DeMarco and Darris Saylors, have both been charged with two counts of larceny over $250, according to Elizabeth Vlock, a spokesperson for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office. Saylors has also been charged with “two counts of false entry into corporate books, uttering a false writing and forgery of a document in connection with an alleged theft,” Vlock wrote in a statement.
CBS Boston first reported the alleged theft on Monday night. According to the television station, police charge that DeMarco and Saylors stole more than $100,000 from a Law School fund allocated for disabled students and used the money to purchase personal items like laptops, iPads, and iPods.
Michelle B. Deakin, a spokesperson for the Law School, said the school worked with both the Middlesex County Attorney’s Office and the Harvard University Police Department on the investigation.
“Criminal charges filed on Feb. 10 by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office stem from an HLS internal financial audit a little over three years ago. The audit resulted in a referral to the Harvard University Police Department in Nov. 2013 by the Law School administration and the former Dean of Students,” Deakin wrote in a statement.
DeMarco worked as the Director of Student Affairs at the Law School between 2008 and 2013, and now works as the Associate Director of the Center for Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership at Babson College. Saylors worked as a manager of student programs at the Law School and now works as the Assistant Director of the University of Chattanooga Honors College.
Neither Saylors nor DeMarco could be reached for comment on Tuesday. In an interview with CBS Boston, DeMarco said that she “made mistakes” while an employee the Law School.
“It was a big job and I made mistakes,” DeMarco said. “I never intended to harm the University. I’m very sorry and will do everything in my power to rectify the situation.”
Deakin said that no students were ever denied any services because to the alleged theft, and that the Law School has since taken steps to prevent a similar occurrence in the future.
“As a result of this matter, the Law School implemented additional layers of controls governing the use of its credit accounts and purchasing protocols,” Deakin wrote.

Students in Math 21a: “Multivariable Calculus” were already stressed for their midterm Thursday. Then Canvas, Harvard’s platform for course websites, stopped working.
Suddenly, students busily preparing for the Math 21a exam could no longer access class worksheets, practice exams, or problem sets.
“It was really annoying,” Math 21a student Aileen D. Villalpando ’20 said.
Canvas remained nonfunctional much of the day Tuesday due to a service glitch at technology company Amazon. The disruption in Amazon’s web services, which began at noon and lasted for roughly five hours, temporarily downed large swathes of the Internet, including popular sites Netflix, Airbnb, and Slack, The Seattle Times reported.
The Canvas outage alarmed many Harvard students, prompting some teaching fellows to extend homework due dates and send out messages of reassurance.
Course staff for at least two classes—Computer Science 124: “Data Structures and Algorithms” and Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance”—emailed students noting the server lapse and pushing back deadlines for assignments slated to be turned in via Canvas. Janet Chen, a preceptor in the Mathematics department and the course head for Math 21a, re-posted practice exams and problem sets on a different website Tuesday afternoon so students could access the documents.
“That was definitely a good thing,” Villalpando said of Chen’s actions.
Still, Chen was only able to re-upload course materials around 3 p.m., meaning some Math 21a students lost several hours of studying.
“I wasn’t really planning on studying at that moment but I can definitely see if anyone had decided to spend today as a study day for Math 21a—I would have been really annoyed,” Villalpando said.
Abdul Saleh ’20, who is also taking Math 21a, agreed with Villalpando. He wrote in an email Tuesday evening that the Canvas malfunction likely “freaked out” many students in the class.
Harvard University Information Technology sent a message to Harvard affiliates informing them of the Amazon and Canvas outage around 5 p.m. Tuesday, and posted updates on the situation to its website throughout the day.
“Canvas and other applications hosted by [Amazon] are experiencing slow or interrupted performance,” the HUIT email reads. “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”
Computer Science 124 teaching fellow Evan Yao ’17 said students in his class had mixed reactions to the Canvas outage. He said some began to panic when they realized they could not turn in their programming problem set, originally due—if students used one “late day”—at 5 p.m. Tuesday.
Course staff later extended the deadline to midnight.
“The students were stressed out by it because they were panicking because they couldn’t turn in their homework,” he said. “But we assured them there would be no problem, we understand, everything would be alright.”
“Other students were happy about it because, for once, Canvas helped them—Canvas gave them an extra seven hours,” Yao added.
Amazon resolved the situation, causing Canvas to come back online, around 5 p.m.
Reflecting on the day’s events, Villalpando said Amazon’s technological struggles made her reconsider her dependence on Canvas and other sites.
“It’s just that, with more reliance on online websites—even though it does make it easier for us to streamline our work and send documents online and not have to worry about printing out papers and turning them in in person—it makes these kinds of events very impactful on us,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2017 at 12:55 p.m.
More than 40 members of the Class of 1981 suggested significant changes to Harvard Management Company’s investment strategy in a letter the group penned to University President Drew G. Faust.
In the letter, the alumni argued Harvard should be equally as concerned with the negative effects of lackluster annual endowment returns as with long-term gains. The letter comes after a particularly dramatic short-term loss: in fiscal year 2016, Harvard returned negative 2 percent on its investments.
“Managing the Harvard endowment for maximum long term gain makes sense if endowment income is not critical to the fulfillment of the annual budget,” the letter reads. “However, clearly the year-to-year endowment income is critical and, in a bad year, can have a severe financial impact on the Harvard community.”
Along with the negative investment returns, several financial flows, including the $1.7 billion HMC allocated to the University’s budget, the value of Harvard’s endowment dropped by almost $2 billion last year. Following the underwhelming financial performance, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences announced it will cut the number of students it will admit this year by 4.4 percent.
Writing under the name “Harvard-Radcliffe Class of 1981 Collaboration,” the alumni largely praised recent changes to HMC’s investment strategy, writing that the reduction in personnel and shift to outside managers is a “reasonable direction” for the firm to move in.
“This approach has been the successful standard of other university endowments, including MIT and that school down in Connecticut,” they wrote. “We hope it will be similarly beneficial to Harvard and to all members of the Harvard community.”
Last month, HMC’s new chief executive N.P. Narvekar announced sweeping changes to the firm’s investment strategy including the reduction of the firm’s internal staff by roughly half and the elimination of the majority of its internal management teams.
The class noted that they expect their suggestion “may reduce long term gains”  but added that “it may also prevent short-term crises, the kind that Harvard will survive, but that vulnerable members of the Harvard community might not.”
In an emailed response to the letter, Faust wrote that she was “pleased to hear from alumni” and would direct the group’s concerns to personnel at HMC.
Echoing concerns raised by a group of alumni from the Class of 1969 that has long rallied for changes to HMC’s executive compensation structure, the 1981 cohort also questioned “why a generous salary is somehow insufficient motivation for fund managers.” Still, the letter commended HMC’s move to tie executive compensation to the endowment’s overall performance instead of the performance of individual asset classes.
“However, requiring a positive return, at least relative to the overall market, before compensatory bonuses are considered does not seem an unreasonable condition for negotiation during the ongoing reorganization,” they added. “This would reassure those of us who have contributed to the endowment, and who intend to continue contributing, that our donations are supporting the Harvard community as intended.”
Layoffs are expected to occur by the end of the calendar year, and the shift to external managers is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2017, which ends in June.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years after the Harvard Square Theater closed its curtains, Cambridge city officials are pushing the owners of the long-vacant Church St. property to come up with a plan for its future soon—and threatening to seize the site if they do not.
Billionaire investor Gerald Chan—who co-founded the Morningside Group—bought the property in 2015 from real estate developer Richard L. Friedman, who had acquired it after the theater closed in July 2012. A Harvard Square staple since 1925, the theater has remained vacant since 2012.
At its Feb. 27 meeting, the Cambridge City Council decided to take up the issue, requesting that City Manager Louis A. DePasquale notify Morningside and Chan to submit long term plans for the property within 30 days.
According to Harvard professor Suzanne P. Blier, who has been active in Harvard Square conservation efforts, the Council discussed harsh measures if this is not achieved—including obtaining the property by eminent domain, where the city would take over the building.
Chan, a Harvard benefactor who donated a then-record $350 million to the School of Public Health in 2014, also owns several other multi-million dollar properties in Harvard Square. Morningside Group could not be reached for comment, but told the Council in December that it would present a plan for the building this spring.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was concerned about the economic impact a large vacant building has on the Square.
“That’s what matters to the community because that’s a very long time for such a large parcel to be dark in the heart of Harvard Square,” Jillson said. “The adverse economic impact that a dark building has on the other businesses on the street, as well as throughout the Square, cannot be dismissed.”
Blier and Jillson said foot traffic lost to the vacant theater has adversely affected other businesses on Church St., including the nearby Mongolian grill-style restaurant FiRE+iCE, which closed in Sept. 2016.
Jillson said even if plans were started now, the slow pace of change in Cambridge would delay efforts. After public meetings and permitting, it could be another two or three years until the property opened, she said.
“I think that what the Council is trying to do is to really send a message, not only to the owner of the theater, but to the owners of other parcels throughout the city that are inactive and dark,” Jillson said.
Blier said she hopes celebrities—like Boston natives Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who had previously worked at the theater—and musicians who have visited and performed at the theater might rally behind its reopening.
“If we can get group of supporters involved, maybe even Bruce Springsteen, or John Lithgow to see what we could do to put together a plan to renovate and reopen the theater, either in its original larger form or divided into smaller spaces, it would be great,” Blier said.
Jillson said she is optimistic about the plans that she anticipates Morningside will lay out soon. She hopes the property will become a mixed-use building, she added.
“When [Chan] does something, he does it very, very nicely,” Jillson said. “I really trust him to do something wonderful, because if you look at some of the other buildings that he’s already restored here in Harvard Square, his team does very, very nice work.”
“The point is that whatever that is, it should happen sooner rather than later,” Jillson added.

Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard spoke at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday evening, offering a detailed look at the economy’s transition from recovery to growth and the ways the Fed is responding to the shift.
Brainard, who received her Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard, served as Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under the Obama administration. In this position, Brainard was the highest-ranking female Treasury Department official in United States history until 2014.
Delivering the Malcolm Wiener Lecture in International Political Economy, Brainard said many national economies are presently on an upswing: the U.S. economy is reaching full employment, Europe’s economy is steadily improving despite the United Kingdom’s prospective withdrawal from the European Union, and China and Japan have had shown stable economic growth, she said.
“The economy appears to be in a transition, we are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target,” Brainard said.
She also discussed the effects of the U.S. federal funds rate on the money supply—the total amount of money in circulation or in existence in a country—and the possibility that the 2008 financial crisis has altered the financial system’s tolerance for taking economic risks.
“The structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger now than prior to the financial crisis because of changes such as new regulations that favor safe liquid assets, and changes in financial institutions and attitudes towards risk,” Brainard said. “The supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to accommodate unexpected shocks.”
Joking that her lecture might go over the heads of some undergraduates in the audience, Brainard responded to a question from a student interested in economics: “I hope my remarks did not deter you from pursuing economics. It’s much more interesting than monetary policy speeches.”
Although Brainard focused on monetary policy in her speech, she fielded questions about financial markets as well. In a question, one student brought up the fact that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had hit 21,000 points for the first time in history earlier that day. “It’s impossible to predict how financial markets are going to move over time," Brainard responded.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Sunday, the Harvard men’s tennis team hosted a doubleheader against No. 44 Memphis and Boston University at the Murr Tennis Center. The Crimson, following a close one point loss to the Tigers, made quick work of their crosstown rival with a dominating 6-1 victory.
Going 1-1 on the weekend, the result continued an up-and-down trend for the team’s first half of the season, leaving their win percentage just above the halfway mark at .538 percent.
“I thought we had great energy in both matches,” junior Xavier Gonzalez said. “The team had a phenomenal fighting spirit.”
HARVARD, 6, BOSTON UNIVERSITY, 1
Rebounding from an afternoon loss to Memphis, Harvard (7-6) recorded a resounding win over Boston University (6-1).
The Crimson swept the doubles competition. Leading off for Harvard in the number one position was the duo of senior Brian Yeung and sophomore Michael Peters with a 6-0 victory. They were followed by a 7-6 tiebreak win for second doubles players sophomore Christopher Morrow and freshman Logan Weber and a 6-4 win for freshman Galen Lee and sophomore Samuel Beren at third doubles. These victories secured the doubles point for the Crimson, its third of the team’s last four matches.
Harvard then continued its dominance with five wins out of six singles matches, led by junior Kenny Tao and Beren in the first and second positions. At third singles, Lee claimed a 6-3, 6-1 victory.
“I looked down the court and saw a lot of the guys really going after the ball and committing to it,” Lee said. “These matches mean so much to the guys lower in the line-up, and we had good energy on the court.”
Gonzalez and Peters rounded out the victories with 7-6, 6-1 games in the fifth and 6-3, 6-3 wins in the sixth singles positions, respectively.
MEMPHIS, 4, HARVARD, 3
The Crimson began the day with a highly-contested doubles face-off against a high-ranking Tigers team. The team stayed neck-and-neck with Memphis (7-2) and battled back from behind in two matches to ultimately earn the doubles point.
However, that impressive performance could not salvage the afternoon, as the hosts fell in a 4-3 nailbiter overall.
The high point of the contest came in the play of Tao and Yeung. That duo claimed its fifth doubles victory in a row with a 7-5 win. The streak of dominance bodes well for the program in future matchups, as many contests hinge on that elusive doubles point.
Though junior co-captain Jean Thirouin and Peters fell in a close 7-6 matchup at second doubles, Morrow and rookie Weber earned a decisive 6-3 victory at the third doubles to win Harvard the doubles point.
The singles matches were similarly tight, with Thirouin battling for a win in three sets at third singles and Morrow defeating Tiger sophomore Felix Rauch 6-4, 6-3 at sixth singles. Memphis then tied things up with victories at first, second, and fourth singles.
The deciding point came down to the fifth singles match between junior Grant Solomon and Tiger freshman, Jan Pallares. Both of the first two sets ended in a 7-6 tiebreak, the first set going to Solomon and the second to Pallares.
Halfway into the third set with Memphis up 3-1, Solomon came down with cramps, forcing him to default and securing the win for the Tigers.
“That was a tough play to lose the match at 3-all,” Lee said. “But overall it was so much fun because all the guys were cheering really loudly and it was a close match.”
The team defeat prevented the Crimson from claiming its first weekend sweep of the season. Harvard has bounced from victory to failure throughout 2017, at one point seesawing between wins and losses for eight straight contests.
With at least 12 matches remaining, including the bulk of conference play, the team must rack up consistent wins to make noise in the Ancient Eight and beyond.
The Crimson will have a chance to rest up in the next week, as its next matches will come over spring break, when the team will travel to San Diego to train and compete in preparation for the Ivy season. By that time, Harvard is hoping to welcome back co-captain Sebastian Beltrame, who has been sidelined with a foot injury.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It didn’t take long for the Crimson to turn the men’s Ivy League Swimming and Diving Championships into a blowout this year. With Harvard slated as heavy favorites coming into the meet, many were calling the competition simply a matter of going through the motions before the first day of the four-day-long contest had even finished.
Leading the charge for Harvard was freshman phenom Dean Farris, who claimed the Phil Moriarty high-point swimmer of the meet award. The first-year contributed 96 points to the 370 point margin that separated Crimson from its closest competitor, Penn.
“I was happy with the performance, I think the team did really well,” Farris said. “I think there was a lot of nervous energy the first day but once we got rolling there was really just no stopping us.”
Farris didn’t just put his name in the number one spot for points in the meet, however. He also put it down in the history books, smashing records in six different events over the course of the competition.
“Coming in as a freshman, I just wanted to make a statement,” Farris said.
You can bet the country is taking notice of him after setting three records in individual events and three in relays events during the meet. This was especially true after his blistering performance in the 200 Freestyle. Farris swam a meet-, school-, and pool-best 1:31.56 on his way to placing his name at the top of the standings for the country in the event this season.
“I would say [the 200 free] was my focus for my training leading up to the meet,” Farris said. “So I wouldn’t say I was surprised with the time because I thought I could do it but I was surprised to actually see it up there on the board.”
Not only does he now have the fastest time in the nation for this season, but he’s also earned his place in the history books as the sixth fastest all-time in collegiate swimming in the event.
That, however, wasn’t the most unexpected moment of the meet for Farris.
“I was actually more surprised about the 100 back,” Farris said.
He broke the meet, pool, and team records for that event on his way to another individual gold.
In the 100 freestyle, Farris competed solo again and again broke team and pool records to claim top marks. Farris wasn’t just setting individual records, though. He was a member of three different record setting relays in the 200 medley, 800 freestyle, and 400 freestyle.
The 200 medley was the first event of the meet and Farris competed alongside seniors Jack Manchester and Max Yakubovich and junior Shane McNamara. For the 800 free relay, the very next event, Farris teamed up with sophomores Brennan Novak and Aly Abdel Khalik and fellow freshman Zach Snyder.
In the 400 free, the last race of the meet and the one that traditionally garners the largest reaction from the crowd, Farris joined seniors Manchester and Yakubovich and junior Ed Kim to set one final record and claim one last gold medal. For Farris, that last gold was the most meaningful.
“Having Jack and Max on there as two seniors was pretty special as it was their last Ivy race,” Farris said. “Then being able to celebrate right after and knowing that we won the meet. So I would say the 400 free relay was [my favorite moment from the meet].”
His team-first mindset isn’t missed by his teammates, who commend his impressive drive and strong character.
"Dean Farris earned every single result we saw on the board this weekend,” Khalik said. “He is one of the most focused and dedicated swimmers I have ever had the chance to swim with and that showed in his results. We are all excited to see what he throws down at NCAAs because at this point, we have all learned to never underestimate him.”
Junior teammate Koya Osada echoed the thought.
"Dean had a phenomenal meet,” Osada said. “It's no surprise that he swam so fast considering his level of preparation throughout the season...The sky's the limit in terms of what he can accomplish in the sport, but he's most importantly a grounded and humble individual."

As the approach of Housing Day strikes fear into the hearts of excited freshman and dominates Annenberg buzz, some people choose to block with their favorite people - themselves. Blocking alone, or floating, is universally dreaded in the Harvard community and seen as a failure to bond with classmates over dhall tater tots and stat psets.
Although floating is considered even more shameful than being bae-less on Valentine's Day, there are definitely some perks. So all of you floaters: calm down and close that safety school transfer application. If you are actually popular and have a blocking group (or have desperately emailed everyone in your yard 30 minutes before the deadline), start dismantling your group ‘cause we’re about to make floating great again.
You get to avoid ~drama~
Lets face it—blocking, like everything at Harvard, is unnecessarily painful. The week before the housing application deadline is somehow more stressful than midterm, comp and punch seasons combined. Floating is your easy way out. Do you actually want to deal with Scandal-worthy schemes and betrayals when you can spend less than a minute on your application? Let your classmates enjoy their blocking-induced tears as you kick back and enjoy the Hunger Games.
No one cares
Right now, you feel like there is a huge scarlet F next to “social status” on your transcript (which you, a Harvard student, are allergic to). This might feel like the end of your social life but fret not— no one will care about you floating after Housing Day. Ever. Seriously, most upperclassmen barely say hi to their blockmates and avoid their linkmates altogether.
New friends!
Floaters get to re-experience the magic of Opening Days, and no, we don’t mean sloppy First Chance Dance makeouts and awkward entryway ice-breakers. You will get the thrill of meeting all kinds of new and exciting people instead of having to settle for your pre-orientation squad. Blocking alone is the perfect chance to diversify your social scene—maybe you’ll even meet your new bff or bae among the other too-cool-for-blocking kids.
Freedom
There is something truly liberating about deciding to enter the unknown of the Housing Lottery by yourself. Don’t let stigma take away your freedom to float. Besides, you did just that when you first came to Harvard and you survived, right? (Or maybe you became a zombie, or a consulting recruit, which are basically the same thing). And forget about high school social hierarchy—being satisfied with your own company doesn’t make you an untouchable loner.
Bonus: you get to pick any cool name for your group without your creativity constrained by that uptight kid your roommate convinced you to block with. “Me, Myself, and I fan club” here we come!
