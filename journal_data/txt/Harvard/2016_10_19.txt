After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some days, the act of checking my agenda becomes stressful in and of itself. I know I’ll only discover additional tasks to complete, as well as reminders to start the tasks I’ve neglected. It’s during these angst-inducing times that I’m most likely to receive electronic notifications from home; perhaps a call from my mother or a text from my girlfriend asking if I’m free to Skype. Rather than comfort me, these reminders of home heighten my anxiety; at times they seem like yet another call to arrange, another hour spent chatting rather than battling my mountain of uncompleted work.
It’s on days like these when I ask myself why I bother to return the calls, reply to the texts, and arrange the Skype sessions with individuals I no longer see on a regular basis. As the saying goes, “Why limit yourself to your past?” Sometimes I find myself tempted to reduce contact with those back home, hoping to redouble my focus on the tasks at hand. After all, most of us are only granted four years to pursue our undergraduate goals. Why let the past dominate the little time we have?
Additionally, your friends from home are no longer the friends you once knew. As you’ve allowed the years to change you, so have they. According to some, in dedicating time your time to old friends, you risk wasting your time maintaining an idealized illusion of the past. These relationships may have existed in a specific time frame, but what happens to these bonds once their respective time frames expire? What then remains of these friendships, other than painful nostalgia and the fear of becoming a shadow of one’s past?
Over the past two years, I’ve witnessed numerous friends abandon one another for the sake of “safeguarding” their future. The temptation to let go, to “begin anew,” as some put it, remains as tantalizing as ever. And that’s when I recall a truth an old friend of mine once taught me.
Upon graduation, daily interaction with your friends will cease for the most part. On that day, your current friends will become your old friends, and how you decide to treat them will mirror the manner in which you deal with your old friends and family from home today. Beware of the friend who easily relinquishes the past; one day you’ll become part of their past, your bonds simply another relic for sacrifice in the name of the almighty myth of progress.
Here’s why the work-centered, college lifestyle is problematic: The only schedule and future that supposedly matter are your own. When I found myself frustrated by notifications from home, rarely did I consider that my mother was making the greater sacrifice of time. Rarely did I consider that, regardless of how stressed I was, my girlfriend found herself overwhelmed by a myriad of much harder subjects (i.e. organic chemistry). More importantly, in classifying their attempts to reach me as a nuisance, I disregarded more than their love; I inadvertently devalued the two most important people in my life.
I know an apology (to my mother, my girlfriend, and various other friends) for my lack of consideration means little at this point, so I hope to accomplish something greater. I want to remind others to try to rekindle a few friendships from home. I understand that many relationships will prove unsalvageable. Hell, some may prove unworthy of bringing back. At times, both you and your friends will want some time for yourself, and that’s alright.
However, I want to dismantle the misconception that marching forward necessarily means never turning back. To some friends from home—and particularly to your families—you represent more than a memory. For better or worse, you represent the investments of countless individuals; as such, they deserve more than your occasional acknowledgement during the holiday season.
Build the courage to write the biweekly letter. Post that old picture of your friend with the wacky hair. Maybe schedule a Skype session or two. Just remember; what matters isn’t those who surround you today, but rather the friends who stood with you in years past and will continue to do so in the years to come, so long as you still stand with them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In September, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the formation of a committee of students, faculty, and administrators to study the implementation of Harvard College’s controversial sanctions on single-gender social organizations in a letter to undergraduates. In particular, the group was charged with determining the scope of the sanctions, recommending compliance measures for student organizations, and developing a disciplinary process. Last week, one of the committee co-chairs and College administrators hosted the first town hall to solicit student feedback on the issue.
As we opined last month, we commend the administration for engaging undergraduates in the process of implementing its sanctions. Lamentably, the town hall raised more questions than it answered.
In last month’s editorial, we criticized the vagueness of Dean Khurana’s letter for suggesting that aspects of the policy remained in flux. The town hall did nothing to quell that suspicion. Asked point blank whether final club members could qualify for a Rhodes scholarship, administrators could have responded with a definite “no,” as indeed the policy clearly dictates. Instead, Professor Kay K. Shelemay, one of the committee’s co-chairs, prevaricated: “I hesitate to speak for Dean Khurana, and I did not design the policy.”
This renewed uncertainty over the implementation committee’s true objectives muddles the role of students in the committee on sanctions. If the body intends to indeed focus solely on the implementation, it is encouraging that the administration has chosen to incorporate student feedback. Undergraduates are uniquely familiar with how campus organizations operate, choose their leaders, and interface with the University. As a result, they can best advise College administrators as they seek to develop the specifics of the new rules.
By contrast, if this committee is a backdoor attempt to redesign the original policy, its structure makes less sense. Of course, student input and argument must factor into this process, but ultimately, administrators must arrive at a final decision before tackling the logistics. They have training, education, institutional perspective, understanding of the possible, and long-term commitment to Harvard. It is precisely their job to outline a vision for the College, even if we do not always fully agree with it.
Fundamentally, more clarity is needed. If the policy itself is up for debate, administrators should simply admit so. The issue can then be debated fully and openly: over the past semester, it has become clear that there are both strong proponents and opponents of the sanctions. Following a broader campus conversation—one incorporating Harvard's more than 6,000 undergraduates, and not just 15—the College could then reassess the wisdom of its initial decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I assumed that the questioning would stop with my application essay. This is it, I remember thinking to myself, as I wrapped up frantically spell-checking my supplement for the third time. I’ve told Harvard everything it ever needs to know about me.
How wrong I was.
I think the realization hit sometime during my first section for my government course. I flipped through my notes, desperately searching for something halfway intelligent-sounding to contribute to a discussion on whether the dominance of established economic powers precludes the growth of developing nations. Never mind that this was one of the most enduring and hotly-debated enigmas of 21st-century international relations. I was expected to have an answer, and I was expected to have it then and there.
Or perhaps the realization hit during my first few lunches at the dining hall. After navigating the schizophrenia of the noon Annenberg rush, I would invariably find myself seated in some table full of exceptionally well-groomed fellow freshmen who were excitedly charting out the course of their entire Harvard careers down to the month.
The realization was that Harvard is something of an unending interrogation. Our experience on campus is, in many ways, defined by a single question: "What do you believe?" It is an inescapable question, one that is asked and re-asked in a seemingly endless number of ways. It’s asked to us in class, at the student activities fair, and amidst the post-presidential debate chatter in a common room.
I am thankful that I am constantly asked this question. That was, after all, why I chose to come to Harvard: to try to challenge my view of who I was and what I believed. However, as I sat in that government section or around an Annenberg table, watching my peers eloquently offer jargon-riddled defenses of American economic dominance and detailed breakdowns of their career plans, I learned that simply asking the question wasn’t enough. Like with all things at Harvard, you have to know the answer.
When it comes to our beliefs, it often seems that the worst imaginable opinion is not an unpopular one but rather having none at all. Any indecision or wavering is chalked up to ignorance or intellectual cowardice. To me, this was a source of terror. As Ted Gup once put it in an NPR essay, I had a tendency “to stand in the no-man's land between opposing arguments, yearning to be won over by one side or the other, but finding instead degrees of merit in both.” But at Harvard, it seemed I had no choice: I had to pretend that I knew where I fell on every single issue, big or small.
Of course, this is hardly limited to life at Harvard. Ours is an era of hashtag debates and Snapchat politics, tantrums, and Trump campaigns. It’s an age where our very sense of individuality rests upon our ability to concisely and emphatically express our identity and beliefs, to constantly advertise what separates us from the horrifying faceless mass that is “everyone else.” In an age where having an opinion defines the way we live, we equate wavering with stupidity or spinelessness.
There is certainly nothing wrong with having a firm, well-grounded opinion. It is also necessary, however, to recognize the importance of weighing conflicting opinions, the value in struggling to find a firm answer. To assume that lack of an opinion implies laziness or thoughtlessness is to ignore the fact that many of the most important dilemmas we face today are far more complex than they may initially appear.
It may seem self-defeating to write an opinion piece in defense of not having an opinion, but at a time when political polarization is at a historic peak and cultural rifts seem more apparent than ever, the courage to see the nuanced, messy middle ground is just as needed as the courage to take a firm ideological stance.
While at Harvard, the appearance of self-assuredness in our beliefs can at times feel all important. Ultimately, however, an obsession with finding definite answers on every issue may lead to stagnation as opposed to discovery. Perhaps what we need more than ever is the courage to not have an answer.

In the U.S. Patent and Trademark Database, you can find all sorts of trademarks held by various institutions. Although our knowledge of anything law-related comes from “Law and Order” reruns, we perused the database nonetheless, looking for the most interesting trademarks held by the President and Fellows of Harvard College. Here are our interpretations of our discoveries.
H: Yes, Harvard has trademarked the letter “H” in yet another effort to distinguish Harvard affiliates from the rest of the world. Non-Harvard folks can no longer say things like “hello,” “happy,” or “hemophilia” without being hit with the force of the law. Elitism reigns on.
Harvard Community Garden: Weird move, Harvard. Trademarking a community garden, which, as its name states, belongs to... the community. Let the people cultivate their root vegetables in peace.
Veritas: Harvard has trademarked its famous crest in every iteration. And we truly mean every. You got your bibles in a triangle. Bibles in a line. “Shields or crests with figurative elements contained therein or superimposed thereon.” Pigeons get involved at one point. So your little cousin who sent you that card in the mail with a poorly drawn Harvard logo at the top? He’s in a lot of legal trouble right now. Related: Did you know that the Harvard Extension School crest features an Aladdin-style genie lamp?
Squash It:  This was a registered trademark for a series of classes preportedly promoting non-violence. No word on what the content of the course was, as the trademark was cancelled in 2003, but with a logo that depicts the phrase “squash it” literally being crushed between a fist and a hand, we can only imagine it was a “fight fire with fire” type of situation.
Crimson Gourmet Coffee: This trademark has been dead since 2003, but was it ever alive? Is gourmet coffee simply a pipe dream within the walls of Harvard’s dining halls? Was palatable, affordable coffee a collective hallucination of our younger and more vulnerable years? Let’s ask HUDS. Too soon?
Pocket Mentor: The next time you venture into the stacks of Widener, don’t make a noise. Let the silence wash over you until—a voice! A tiny voice! It’s your Pocket Mentor, come to whisper sweet nothings in your ear as you slog through this essay! Keep them secret, though. Trademarked items are serious business.
Ask What You Can Do: You think this trademark refers to the familiar words of John F. Kennedy, perhaps for use in the Kennedy School of Government? Think again. This is an act preventing anyone not immediately affiliated with Harvard from asking how they can help someone. Give your mom and high school guidance counselor a call, because they might be needing a lawyer.
Hahvahd: This one is really sneaky. We always thought this slightly cringe-worthy impression of a Boston accent was the result of creative evasion of copyright infringement, since the tour company couldn’t use Harvard’s trademarked name. Wrong. Harvard owns this one, too. Apparently they just pretend to be rivals with regular Harvard tours for funsies.
Thank Your Mentor Day: Oh, you silly young grasshopper. You thought you could express gratitude without explicit permission from the President and Fellows of Harvard College? Ha.
Hi: This could refer to a software program. It could also explain the fact that since its registration in 2013 most traditional greetings have been replaced by “Suuuuuup” and “Have you started the pset yet?” Every social interaction is just an attempt to avoid a lawsuit.
And finally, here are some highlights from when we entered the term “Harvard” instead of “President and Fellows of Harvard College” into the database. You can decide for yourself what’s going on here: Grandmaster Funk; Voodoo Karma; No Sweat No Swag; Sir Growls-a-Lot; My Pet Ghost; Blue Llama; Princess Pottymouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 1:22 a.m.
Harvard graduate students moved one step closer to unionizing after reaching an agreement with the University to hold an election on unionization next month, marking the first formal arrangement between the two parties.
The group of graduate students moving to unionize—Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers—also filed a petition to the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday to move forward with the process. 
Eligible students will vote in a secret ballot election on whether or not to authorize the HGSU-UAW as their union Nov. 16 and 17, according to an email sent to Harvard affiliates. According to the agreement, only students on the University payroll as of Oct. 15 are eligible to vote.
“The University and HGSU-UAW have signed an election agreement. Subject to approval by the NLRB, the agreement defines who can vote, where and when voting will take place, and other logistical and technical details related to the election,” reads the email, signed by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76.
In the agreement, signed by the University’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations Director Paul R. Curran and several student union organizers, the University and union effort agreed that a collective bargaining unit would include “graduate and undergraduate Teaching Fellows,” including teaching and course assistants, as well as graduate student research assistants at the University “regardless of funding sources.” However, undergraduate research assistants will not be included in the unit, making the bargaining unit in line with the NLRB’s hallmark decision in August.
At Harvard, the path is now clear to a single election in which all eligible graduate and undergraduate students will be able to cast a ballot. Voting will take place across the University’s campuses—at the Science Center, the Business School, and Tosteson Medical Education Center on the Medical School campus.
Eligible students will vote “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you wish to be represented for purposes of collective bargaining with Harvard University by HARVARD GRADUATE STUDENTS UNION-UAW (HGSU-UAW)?”
“With only four weeks until the anticipated vote, we hope students will move quickly to investigate the issues that matter most to them,”Garber wrote.
During this phase of the unionization process, the NLRB will first certify that the graduate student union effort has enough support to call for an election. As of February, a majority of graduate students employed by the University had signed authorization cards in favor of unionizing—a measure the NLRB will use to determine if the union effort has sufficient support—far more than the 30 percent threshold required by the NLRB for an election.
HGSU-UAW spokesperson Jack M. Nicoludis said the union effort decided to wait until this point rather than immediately file following the August decision—as organizers at Yale did—in order to “make sure that we had the chance to talk to all these other students that were covered by the Columbia decision and new students to Harvard.”
“We wanted to be the most expansive we can be,” Nicoludis said.
After the NLRB decision recognized undergraduate teaching fellows as workers, the union effort began an exploratory effort to inform undergraduates about the movement, and to gauge student interest. Some undergraduates said they were approached in dining halls and around campus about joining the union, and many others received emails asking them to join or sign an authorization card.
“We have undergrad organizers working with us that attend our weekly meetings and are doing outreach to undergraduates simultaneously to the outreach that we’re doing to graduate students. So it’s pretty much the same style,” Nicoludis said.
This agreement means Harvard’s graduate students will not pursue the department-by-department “microunit” strategy that Yale’s union effort opted for, where graduate students planned to hold separate elections in 10 Graduate School departments for a single bargaining unit. Yale’s administration challenged the unconventional approach, and the process in New Haven has thus far been tied up in NLRB hearings.
At Harvard, union organizers posted a celebratory picture of supporters in front of the John Harvard Statue on the group’s Facebook page Tuesday. “Today is FILING DAY!” the post reads.
Ph.D. student and union organizer Niharika N. Singh, one of the signers of the agreement, said she was “very excited” about delivering the petition to the University this morning, a required step in the process of filing a petition to the NLRB.
“We went in and signed the agreement and also delivered the petition, and the atmosphere was not tense,” Singh said.
Harvard administrators have adamantly opposed graduate student unionization since students began their movement in the spring of 2015. University President Drew G. Faust has repeatedly argued that a union of graduate students would change the relationship between students and Harvard from one based in academics to one based in labor.
But at the end of the summer, the NLRB ruled that private universities must recognize a union of student assistants, overturning precedent, thus legally mandating Harvard to do so should its graduate students organize.
Union organizers and the University’s labor representatives met for the first time Sept. 9, with students aiming to walk away with a formal neutrality agreement similar to the one New York University signed with its graduate student union effort in 2013.
Nicoludis said despite the progress toward an election, the HGSU-UAW was “very disappointed” that the University has not signed a neutrality agreement, saying that without such an agreement, “graduate workers aren’t able to decide on their own.”
Nicoludis said the union effort is continuing to garner signatures on its neutrality pledge campaigns; the pledge it circulated to faculty has over 100 signatures.
According to labor law expert and Stanford Law professor William B. Gould, a former chairman of the NLRB, the University could sign a neutrality agreement even now, “but the fact that they have entered into an election agreement means that this is very unlikely.”
Singh added, “If the administration still wants to come forward with neutrality, that would be great, but we’re looking forward to going ahead with the election.”
Although the Graduate Student Council became more involved in the issue when it voted to condemn the University’s amicus brief against unionization in April, GSC president Darcy L. Frear said the Council is a “neutral party.”
“Since the GSC represents all GSAS students we are a neutral party that supports those students who want to be a part of a union, as well as those who do not,” Frear wrote in an email. “I think the election is the best way to discover what the majority of students want.”

Houghton Library has expanded its historical documents collection with the donation of the José Maria Castañé collection, which features historical artifacts from the 20th century.
The collection, which arrived on campus in spring 2015, includes documents from the Russian Revolution, both World Wars, the Spanish Civil War, and the Cold War, was donated by the Jose Maria Castañé Foundation in 2014.
History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, who reviewed the collection, said it can provide students with a better understanding of the 20th century.
“It gives students a visit inside into why the history of the 20th Century was such a contested, passionate, and crucial history in real ideological battles,” said Maier, a former Crimson editorial chair. “It’s a testimonial to ideological divisions into the first two-thirds of the 20th Century.”
Castañé said he began to collect the documents following the death of his son in 1985. He chose to donate his collection to Harvard after vetting various universities and public libraries in the U.S.
“[Harvard] would consider this gift respectable and something useful from a cultural point of view,” he said about his decision.
Castañé first contacted Leslie A. Morris, Houghton’s curator of modern books and manuscripts, in 2014 to inform her that his foundation was considering donating the collection to Harvard. Morris said the process of acquiring the collection was somewhat arduous because Houghton required government approval to import the items from Spain.
The library has constructed an exhibition featuring some of the more famous documents in the collection. Castañé wrote an essay for the exhibition around his process of acquiring the works and the significance of the exhibition.
Morris said she was particularly impressed by a manuscript of a speech given by President Harry S. Truman at the end of World War II.
“It just gives me a little bit of a thrill to see President Truman’s speech… with his emendation on it, adding on a comment he wished Franklin Roosevelt could be there to see this day,” she said. “That tells me a little bit more about what was going through Truman’s mind as he was starting this really important speech.”
The exhibition is accompanied by a three part lecture series highlighting various components of the collection this year, according to Morris.

UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 3:22 p.m.
With 34 U.S. Senate seats up for grabs in the midst of a tense 2016 election season, Harvard boasts more than a few contenders with hats in the ring.
In total, five Harvard alumni—four of them incumbents–have declared their candidacy for the Senate this year. Thirteen current U.S. senators can claim ties to Harvard, bearing degrees from the College, the Law School, or the Kennedy School. Pending the results of this election, that number could rise to 14 after Nov. 8. 
“I don’t think it’s surprising,” professor of government and sociology Theda Skocpol said of Harvard’s representation in the Senate. “We know Harvard, along with a few other institutions, are elite colleges that set people up for success.”
The Harvard graduates running for reelection to the Senate are Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal ’67 from Connecticut, Republican Senator Michael D. Crapo—a Law School graduate from the Class of 1977—from Idaho, Democratic Senator Charles E. Schumer ’71 from New York, and Republican Senator Patrick J. Toomey ’84 from Pennsylvania.
Democratic candidate Russell D. Feingold–who graduated from HLS in 1979–from Wisconsin is also running for reelection to the Senate, though not as an incumbent. Feingold served as Wisconsin’s senator from 1993 to 2011 before suffering a defeat in his 2010 campaign for reelection at the hands of Oshkosh businessman Republican Ron Johnson.
FiveThirtyEight, a website known for its elections predictions, currently gives Blumenthal, Crapo, Schumer, and Feingold high chances of winning their individual Senate races: 98.8 percent, 98.9 percent, 99.9 percent, and 91.1 percent, respectively. According to the site, the Senatorial races in Connecticut, Idaho, and New York are unlikely to play a significant role in deciding whether the Democrats or Republicans gain a majority of the chamber–Wisconsin, however, may.
This year, more than twice as many Republican-held Senate seats are up for election as Democratic seats: 24 as opposed to 10, allowing Democrats to go on the offensive in their quest to take back the majority. Democrats must gain a net five additional seats to win numerical control of the Senate. If Democratic presidential nominee Hillary R. Clinton gains the White House, however, Democrats need nab just four, given that the Vice President’s vote can serve as a tiebreaker.
Wisconsin, where Feingold is running against incumbent Johnson, is one of the states likely to switch hands this election, and could help Democrats seize a Senatorial majority. FiveThirtyEight ranks Wisconsin’s “tipping-point chance,” or the probability that the state’s Senate race will decide whether Democrats or Republicans attain a majority, at 2.9 percent.
Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said he agreed with FiveThirtyEight’s assessment of Wisconsin, deeming it “a pretty pivotal state” for both political parties. He added that Democrats are “banking on” Feingold, as a former senator to reclaim his seat.
“That would be one of the four seats Democrats would have to pick up, assuming they win the presidency,” Miringoff said. “It would be very hard for the Democrats to get to 50 [Senate seats] without picking up a Wisconsin seat and flipping that back to the Democratic column.”
Miringoff disagreed, however, with FiveThirtyEight’s confident projection of a Feingold victory. Referencing polling data from RealClearPolitics, which gives Feingold a slim advantage over Johnson, Miringoff said he thinks Feingold has only a “single digit lead.”
“Although FiveThirtyEight might have it at 91 percent, it’s probably closer than that,” he said. “Something that’s within the margin of error is something that you can’t count on at this point. I think it’s still competitive.”
Other senators with Harvard degrees not currently up for reelection include Tim Kaine, an HLS alum and Clinton’s pick for vice presidential running mate, and Law School graduate Ted Cruz, who ran for the 2016 Republican nomination before losing to Donald J. Trump.

The former Penthouse Cafe located on the top floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles has recently been transformed into a hub of artistic creativity, where experimental musicians and performers can gather and find a venue for expression.
Laila M. Smith ’17-’18 and Benjamin S. Wetherfield ’17, the co-founders of the new venue and experienced musicians themselves, stumbled upon the space last spring and were inspired to repurpose it to address what they saw as a lack of performance spaces geared towards student use.
Since then, Smith and Wetherfield have developed a unique vision for the space, distinguishing it from other performance spaces on campus.
“We want it to be experimental insofar as we want people to be trying things that they’ve never tried before,” Smith said. “As a performer, I have often felt that we were lacking in low-stakes spaces where people could try things out.”
The venue, which opened at the start of the semester, has had three performances and hopes to feature independent artists—in particular, students who may face difficulty securing venues because they are not involved with organized or well-known campus arts groups, according to Smith.
“We want to say that we’re actively affirming of all kinds of people, all kinds of identities, and we want to do our best to welcome those people and feature those people in our space,” Smith said.
After they developed their idea, inspired in part by their previous experiences attending other performances such as the Edinburgh Music Festival, Smith and Wetherfield submitted a detailed proposal to the Office of Student Life for approval and the College’s support.
Jatnna Amador, manager of events for the SOCH, was enthusiastic about backing their project from the start, and helped provide support from the OSL for music equipment.
“I’m really happy it’s happening. I think I’ve had several requests from students who were like ‘we’re missing this space where it’s unstructured, where students can come and show their craft,’ and I’m glad it’s happening finally in the SOCH,” Amador said.
The three performances to date include an opening event featuring undergraduate singers, a poetry performance set to live music, and a show by graduate student composers.
“The first two nights I couldn’t have imagined in my wildest dreams how well attended they’d be. All credit goes to the artists themselves,” many of whom brought along audience members, Wetherfield said.
In the months ahead, Smith and Wetherfield hope to expand the range of disciplines involved in the space. In addition to music, they hope to feature play reading, experimental performance art, student visual art, and more.
“I want to think of it as as much of an interdisciplinary space as it can be,” Smith said.

Being a Republican at Harvard has historically been difficult, but supporting Donald J. Trump may give a whole new meaning to the phrase “the elephant in the room.”
As the populist appeal of the Republican presidential nominee burned its way through the nation this past year, some students in the ivory tower at Harvard have felt the heat of his message, too. Just don’t expect them to walk around wearing “Make America Great Again” hats.
Surrounded mostly by liberal-minded peers and abandoned politically by the Harvard Republican Club, which took the unprecedented step of publicly denouncing its own Party’s standard-bearer as “a threat to the survival of the Republic” in August, a small number of undergraduates still count themselves as Trump supporters.
Overwhelmingly in the minority, some pro-Trump students have shied from speaking openly about their political preference.
“If someone asks who I am voting for, I have no problem telling them Trump, but I’m not about to put a ‘Make America Great Again’ sticker on my Macbook," said Republican Club member Luke K. Kelly ’19.
A straw poll sent out to members of the Harvard Republican Club this summer found a comparably small minority—12 percent of respondents—said they supported Trump, compared to 20 percent who supported Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton and 36 percent who supported Libertarian Party nominee Gary E. Johnson. Roughly 50 club members indicated their preferences in the poll, according to Alexander J. Cullen ’18, the Republican Club’s secretary.
The Republican Club also took the extraordinary step of condemning Trump in a statement, writing that the candidate was “poisoning our country and our children” The denouncement drew widespread attention from the likes of The Washington Post and CNN.
Still, some Trump supporters remain resolute in their support for Trump. Cullen said that he has not felt silenced when it come to expressing his political views, and even wrote an op-ed in The Crimson entitled “In Defense of Donald Trump.”
“It hasn’t been oppressive or anything,” Cullen said. “But it has been a little tough to speak out at times, especially as the only [Republican Club] board member who supports Trump.”
Others, though, have chosen to keep their political preferences to themselves. One Trump supporter declined to comment for this article, citing a discomfort with publicly expressing political opinions. Thayer D. Wade, who is currently taking off what would be his senior fall to work as a field representative for the Trump campaign in New Hampshire, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Trump supporters on Harvard's campus are greatly outnumbered. In The Crimson’s survey of the College’s incoming Class of 2020, just six percent of respondents said they planned on voting for Trump in the November’s election, compared to 80 percent who planned to vote for Clinton. A 2012 Crimson election survey of undergraduate and graduate students found 17 percent of respondents planned on voting for Republican nominee Mitt Romney.
In fact, Republican Club President Declan P. Garvey ’17 said that the club has “no qualms” with its members crossing the aisle this election to vote for Clinton, who they might see as “the lesser of two evils.”
“I’m registered in Illinois—not a swing state—so I feel comfortable voting third-party,” added Garvey. “But if I were registered in a swing state like Florida or Colorado or Ohio, I would very likely vote for Hillary Clinton–which is a testament to just how dangerous I believe Donald Trump to be, given the many misgivings I have with Hillary Clinton and her candidacy.”
Still, Cullen and Kelly defended Trump—even on some of his more controversial policies and remarks.
“Trump believes in the greatness of this country and the boundless potential of the American people,” Cullen said. “And that’s always the general premise I start off with in explaining why I support Trump—his policies flow out of his care for his people.”
At the same time, however, both conceded that Trump is not without his faults. Particularly in light of recently unearthed footage which showed Trump making extremely lewd comments in 2005 about groping and trying to have sex with women, Cullen said the incident, “definitely made me think. I don’t in any way excuse remarks like that, since they contradict how I strive to treat women.”
However, “still standing by Trump through this scrutiny,” he contrasted Trump’s response to the scandal with Clinton’s reaction to her own email controversy.
“Trump confronted the footage, saying he was not proud of it, and that he will be a better man from this day forward,” Cullen said. “With Clinton, I have not seen the same forthright apology regarding the email scandal, which in fact is much more costly than Trump’s video.”
Focusing in on Clinton in particular, both supporters warned the alternative to a Trump presidency could be much worse.
“Is [Trump] a perfect candidate? By no means,” Kelly said. “But he is the best option we’re left with to turn the tide of Obama’s failed policies.”
While Trump and his supporters have complained about how the media has treated the candidate, Kelly said the narrative that paints Trump’s followers as “deplorables” misses a core tenet of his appeal.
“It is easy for the media to supply the narrative that Trump supporters are racist, xenophobic, or ‘deplorable,’ but they are ignoring the very real struggles that many Americans have, which have been caused by Obama and will only continue under Clinton,” Kelly said.
Further diving into the specifics of a laundry list of policy issues, Cullen said he was encouraged to see that Trump intended to strengthen the U.S. military, stem illegal immigration, and bring jobs back to America.
Neither were shy about addressing Trump’s critics either.
“A lot of people have labeled him as anti-Hispanic, or anti-Muslim,” Cullen said.
“People are quick to make fun of the Skittles,” he added, referring to a Twitter post in which Donald Trump, Jr. compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles sprinkled with a few that “would kill you.”
“I don’t know why you would use candy, but there is some truth to the argument,” he said. “If there is a small percentage of fundamentalist Islamists that could get into our country and initiate some sort of attack, then it makes sense to implement a stricter vetting process.”
As the Harvard Republican Club moves away from Trump and focuses on down-ballot races, Cullen said he thought the club was making a strategic mistake.
“I reserve the utmost respect for the other board members of the [Harvard Republican Club],” Cullen said. “But their decision not to endorse Trump was overly far-sighted. Their philosophy is to regroup and try again in 2020—that underestimates the damage a Clinton presidency could do to our country.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Arab American Institute President James J. Zogby discussed the negative portrayal of Arab Americans in popular culture and stressed the need for a better understanding of Arab culture at an Institute of Politics forum Tuesday night.
Zogby noted the discussion, entitled “The Continuing Challenges Faced by Arab Americans" and moderated by religion professor Diana L. Eck, focused on Arab Americans rather than Muslim Americans. Zogby said the majority of Arab Americans were in fact Christian, not Muslim.
“Arab American is an invention of an ethnic community that comes from diverse country, religious, and generational backgrounds,” Zogby said. “It’s also voluntary association—if you want to be part of the community, then you are. If you don’t want to be, then you aren’t.”
Zogby discussed how he failed to find positive media portrayals of Arab Americans while researching for his 2010 non-fiction work, “Arab Voices: What They Are Saying to Us, and Why it Matters.”
“There was a stubborn ignorance of Arab culture and the Arab world in America,” he said, noting that terrorists or oil magnates wearing long robes are typical stereotypes of Arabs.
Zogby said self-identification became a struggle for many Arab Americans because of this negative portrayal of Arabs in American media. Zogby shared an anecdote about his children, who refused to wear clothing associated with Arabs during multi-cultural school events at a younger age.
“The issue is that we don’t see Arab people are real people with joy in their life,” Zogby said. “When we don’t see them as real people, we cannot possibly treat them like people.”
In response, Zogby advocated for better education and understanding of Arab culture led by Arab Americans.
“The only way that Americans would know us is if we go to them,” Zogby said. “The most learning will be accomplished through meeting one another.”
Audience member Farid Nemri said he was inspired by Zogby’s suggestion.
“As an Arab American living in the U.S., it is primarily our responsibility to engage in American culture and society to showcase my culture and provide better understanding through my actions,” he said.

A year and a half after award-winning British architect Richard Rogers donated a house in London, England, to the Graduate School of Design, the GSD announced last week it will use the house to host a new residency program.
“We were very delighted, in a way blessed, to receive a gift in this house from Lord Rogers and his wife,” GSD Dean Mohsen Mostafavi said. “It will become the focus and centerpiece to a number of new programs.”
The house was originally designed for Rogers' parents in the 1960s. After being put up for sale for 3.2 million British pounds—roughly $4 million— in 2013, the Rogers' house was taken off the market and instead donated to Harvard in April 2015.
The new Richard Rogers Fellowship Program will award six fellows a $10,000 prize and a three month residency at the Rogers House to conduct research in London. According to a press release, the goal of the program is to “support research that addresses alternative and sustainable urban futures.”
Rogers and his wife Ruth are the 2016-2017 Senior Loeb Scholars, and are visiting Harvard this week to present several seminars and lectures. Rogers delivered the second annual Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities Annual Lecture Tuesday night to a full audience in the GSD’s Piper Auditorium.
Rogers’ lecture touched on the gamut of his architecture career ranging from the Pompidou Center in Paris to the Lloyd’s building in London, in addition to the house he recently donated to GSD.
“Architects have got to stop thinking their job is to build a beautiful building but rather how do we deal with society,” Rogers said.
Throughout the lecture, he focused on the humanistic elements of sustainability as well as the intersection between politics and design.
“Architecture is political. Architecture is not purely about design,” he said. “It is about shelter and how you create shelter which not only not only gives a result to the user but also to the passerby.”
Toward the end of the event, Rogers addressed charges that architecture is becoming an undervalued field.
“We need to understand the economics of land, the sustainability of land, and also the technology of land,” Rogers said. “Otherwise, we end up as hut decorators, and that’s where we’re slowly being forced.”
GSD student Ellie J. Han said she appreciated Rogers’ interdisciplinary emphasis.
“The lecture was amazing and fun. He not only touched on the engineering side of sustainability but also explained the politics, architecture, the intersection of the two when it comes to sustainability,” said Han.

Sustainability experts spoke about challenges in crafting climate policies at an event Tuesday evening.
Rachel Kyte, the CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, gave the keynote speech. Sustainable Energy for All is an initiative launched by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to improve energy access, increase energy efficiency, and promote renewable energy.
Kyte also discussed her work with the World Bank and on the Paris Agreement, the global climate change accord signed last December that will take effect in early November.
The talk was sponsored by the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the Harvard Kennedy School and was moderated by Kennedy School professor Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64. Part of the program’s lecture series on “Science and Democracy,” Kyte’s talk was the 20th event in the series.
Kyte shared a story about her involvement in the World Bank’s work on sustainable practices and universal sustainable development goals. Kyte served as vice president of the World Bank and as a special envoy for climate change until December 2015.
After Kyte spoke, a panel of speakers discussed their thoughts on her statements, as well as their own work with climate change. Panelists frequently mentioned the promise of the Paris Agreement as well.
Henry Lee ’68, the director of the Environmental and Natural Resources Program at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, spoke about the need for enthusiastic U.N. leadership to work for energy efficiency.
“It was very interesting to notice how so much of this is bottom-up and how we have switched from Kyoto which was a top-down process,” he said in an interview after the event.
He described Kyte as “one of the more enlightened, thoughtful individuals who are working on [implementing the Paris Agreement] today.”
Law School student Erum K. Sattar said she enjoyed Kyte’s answer to her question regarding the possibilities for nuclear energy in developing countries. Sattar had pointed to an iPhone app called ISO to Go that said up to 36 percent of energy in the Cambridge area came from nuclear energy, and asked why nuclear energy couldn’t be pursued as a sustainable energy source in developing countries.
“I think the most interesting part... was the admission that I heard from our keynote speaker that essentially it's probably public perception of nuclear energy that is no longer favorable,” she said.

Harvard’s dining services workers have been marching and banging drums throughout their historic strike over the past two weeks, and one group of students has taken up the workers' cause with equal gusto.
Harvard's Student Labor Action Movement—a group of undergraduates that advocates for workers’ rights—has coordinated student support for the dining services employees as they demand to retain their current healthcare plan and higher wages from the University.
SLAM members have been a noticeable presence throughout the strike, circulating email petitions, organizing a student walkout, and inviting thousands of students to strike-related Facebook events.
However, some students have questioned the group’s methods, arguing SLAM’s efforts have stifled debate across campus and drawn focus away from the workers themselves.
In the past, SLAM has been an active presence in labor organizing efforts, previously participating in the “Fight For 15” campaign to raise the minimum wage and supporting the unionization of hotel workers on Harvard-owned property. The group has also actively supported HUDS employees, working since September to raise awareness for the HUDS workers’ causes.
The group has consistently criticized the offers Harvard has made in its months-long negotiations with the dining workers and UNITE HERE Local 26, the Boston-based union representing HUDS employees, writing in a Harvard-wide petition that the University “consistently fails to look out for its lowest-paid and hardest-working employees.” The group has also taken on the role of the strike’s unofficial student public relations department, frequently sending out mass emails including one that characterized an administrative update email as containing “false comparisons and deceptive statistics.”
SLAM members have voiced similar sentiments throughout the strike, which will enter its 15th day on Wednesday. They have repeatedly emphasized that the University’s offers, as they stands now, do not properly take care of workers.
“We’re a community, and we stick up for each other,” said SLAM member Gabe G. Hodgkin ’18.
Some students, however, see SLAM as intolerant of viewpoints that look negatively upon the strike.
Peter Wright ’19, for example, said he found the student body, including SLAM, to be guilty of stifling alternative opinions. He also characterized the workers’ strike as “completely ridiculous,” adding that HUDS workers enjoy wages relatively high for those in food service.
“I have a lot of issues with SLAM, and that is definitely one on the list,” he said.
Similarly, Declan P. Garvey ’17, president of the Harvard Republicans, was critical of SLAM’s tactics in garnering support for this month’s protests.
“I think the loudest people in the strike are the SLAM members, and I think you can assume that’s the overwhelming consensus on campus,” Garvey said. “I think if you actually lay out some of the facts, you can see that there are people who are not vocal on either side.”
In addition to those criticisms, others have said the group may be putting too much focus onto the needs and role of students in a conflict centered around workers and Local 26.
Brittany L. Wang ’17, Quincy House Committee co-chair, said while the student demonstrators have been generally successful at raising awareness, “this battle is not really about the students.”
“I think students can definitely keep the morale up, but ultimately the fight doesn't have anything to do with students,” Wang said.
Hodgkin said that his discussions throughout the strike have been respectful and understanding of all attitudes. “I would say that we really want this to be a respectful community,” he said.
Throughout the strike, SLAM has organized a handful of events to get students involved. In addition to their previously mentioned efforts, they have organized a series of rallies, a “dine-in” demonstration, and launched a phone and email campaign urging students to personally contact members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, with their concerns.
Hodgkin said he thought SLAM’s efforts were largely successful—the group’s rallies and other demonstrations have garnered hundreds of student supporters across several Harvard schools, and according to Hodgkin, workers and union members have been grateful and enthusiastic about students’ role in the strike.
Grace F. Evans ’19, another SLAM member, emphasized that the group's upmost priority during the strike remains advocating for the workers themselves.
“It’s absolutely essential that the focus of the strike remain on the workers,” Evans said.

UPDATED: October 19, 2016, at 3:09 p.m.
The Ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda to the United States is calling upon the University to provide reparations to Antiguans, some of whom are descendants of slaves owned by a family whose 18th century donation Harvard used to establish its first law professorship.
Last week, Sir Ronald Sanders sent a letter to University President Drew G. Faust urging the Harvard Corporation to follow Georgetown’s example and “demonstrate its remorse and its debt to those unnamed slaves from Antigua and Barbuda.” Georgetown University recently pledged to take measures to atone for its own slave-owning past, including offering admissions preference to the descendants of slaves it sold in the 1830’s.
In his letter, Sanders specifically proposed that the Law School offer annual scholarships to Antiguan students as one form of reparations.
Two centuries ago, Isaac Royall, Jr. provided land in his will for Harvard to endow a professorship of law, physics, or anatomy. In 1815, Harvard chose to create a professorship of law, which would eventually serve as the foundation for Harvard’s fledgling law school. Harvard Law School was not officially established until 1817.
Royall, Jr.’s wealth derived from the Massachusetts farms and a sugar plantation in Antigua he had inherited from his father—properties that relied on and profited from slave labor. The Royalls were a prominent slave-owning family in the small Caribbean country in the early 18th century.
The Royall Professorship of Law still exists at Harvard Law, and until last spring, the school’s official seal displayed the Royall crest. Student activists last fall demanded the Law School discard the crest, and in March, a Law School committee tasked with re-examining the seal’s history released a recommendation that the school change the seal. The Harvard Corporation officially approved that recommendation soon after, and the Law School remains without an official seal.
The debate over the seal constituted part of a broader University-wide conversation about Harvard’s legacy of slavery. Last spring, Faust dedicated a plaque to four slaves who worked on Harvard’s campus in the 18th century. And next spring, Harvard will host a conference on the history of slavery at U.S. colleges and universities.
But Sanders believes Harvard owes an outstanding debt to Antiguans, and—now that Georgetown has provided a model—now is the time collect on it.
“If Georgetown could do that, we thought that Harvard University ought to emulate them and do the same thing,” Sanders said in an interview.
The University has not yet responded to Sanders’s letter, though according to spokesperson David J. Cameron the University is working on a response. Law School spokespeople declined to comment.
But Faust has directly engaged with questions raised by Georgetown’s reparations plan. Earlier this month, Faust discussed the school’s legacy of slavery with Georgetown University President John J. DeGioia and writer for The Atlantic Ta-Nehisi Coates, a well-known proponent of reparations. And in an interview with The Crimson last month, before receiving Sanders’s letter, Faust drew distinctions between Georgetown’s past and Harvard’s.
“I am not aware of any slaves that were owned by Harvard itself, and slavery was much less of a presence and an economic force in New England than it was in Washington, D.C., and the South,” she said. “Mostly slave records were kept as economic records, business records, and the records we have of slaves at Harvard are much scarcer and less complete.”
For Sanders, the fact that Harvard profited in some way from the “blood money” of the Royall’s Antiguan slaves—regardless of whether Harvard directly owned the slaves—is a compelling enough reason for Harvard to extend benefits to Antiguans.
Because of the difficulty of tracing the descendants of the Royall slaves, Sanders proposed that the Law School extend scholarships each year to Antiguans in general, rather than just to direct descendants. Elaborating on this proposal in an interview, Sanders also suggested that Harvard help fund a new university currently being built in Antigua—the first institution of higher education in the country. Currently, the Antiguan government must provide scholarships for students to pursue higher education abroad.
While Sanders formulated the proposals, he said he did so with the backing of the government of Antigua and Barbuda.

Concerned by the dining hall worker strike’s impact on House life, Faculty Deans and House Committees are hosting additional food and community events for students.
College administrators have allocated additional funds to the Houses and the freshman Yards for programming during the strike, which Houses have used for study breaks and other events, according to an email statement from Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. The Office of Student Life has also granted HoCos money to plan additional events, O’Dair wrote.
As of Tuesday, the dining halls in Adams, Cabot, Leverett, Lowell, Mather, and Pforzheimer remained closed. Lowell Faculty Dean Diana L. Eck described in an email the challenges of maintaining community amidst the dining hall closures.
“This has been a very difficult time for House community, since the Dining Hall is really the epicenter of our House life. There is an emptiness and loneliness in the heart of the House,” Eck wrote. “It is very difficult to make up for the energy and caring that our Dining Hall workers bring to the community.”
Eck added that Lowell tutors and HoCo members had volunteered to facilitate House events and brain breaks. She also said tutors were concerned about the impact of decreased student interactions on mental health.
Leverett Faculty Dean Howard Georgi ’68 echoed concerns regarding the difficulty of maintaining community with the dining hall closed during the strike.
“We are doing our best to keep the dining hall alive, but it is particularly difficult because our dining hall is closed. We don’t even have working drink machines,” he said. “We are hoping that the work stoppage will end soon and that our beloved dining hall workers can get back to work.”
Students said they appreciated the efforts to mitigate the effects of the strike in the Houses, though the events could not fully make up for the dining hall closures.
Adams HoCo treasurer Ryan M. Ward ’18 said additional funding from the OSL was helpful to the HoCo’s efforts. He also highlighted the opportunity which the dining hall closures offered to meet people outside of their houses.
“It’s nice, but it’s always a little disjointed because you don’t have that consistent group to eat with,” he said. “And it’s certainly not the same.”
Currier resident Eric S. Chen ’18 said he was skeptical of the ability of House food events to address more underlying issues.
“I think it’s helpful, but it’s not going to solve the troubles of the strike or people not having enough good food to eat,” he said.

With the contentious 2016 presidential election nearing its end, Tom B. Cotton ’99, Republican U.S. Senator from Arkansas and a Law School alumnus, may have begun to look towards the 2020 election.
Cotton, 39, recently traveled to Iowa for four days of campaign stops, concluding his visit by delivering the keynote speech at Scott County’s Republican dinner—a meal that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence also attended. Cotton’s travels prompted the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, and The Economist to publish articles speculating on the senator’s presidential ambitions.
Cotton's staff did not respond to request for comment.
Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol said she also thinks Cotton is eyeing the 2020 race.
“I think he’s to be taken very seriously,” she said. “He’s already in Iowa, he’s laying the basis for capturing an aggressive stance on foreign policy and the following of Donald Trump in this election, but doing so in a way that will be more disciplined than [Trump].”
“He wouldn’t say things to alienate women, for example,” Skocpol added, referring to the Republican presidential nominee’s lewd comments about women in a tape first reported by the Washington Post. She also said Cotton is “more in control of his personal emotions” than Trump, who is known for firing insults at political opponents and detractors over Twitter.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 largely agreed with Skocpol, deeming it “unsurprising” that Cotton would seek the presidency or that other people would consider him a contender for the role.
Mansfield, who has been at Harvard for nearly five decades, said he taught Cotton as an undergraduate in “a couple of courses” and was “quite close” to him, even reading Cotton’s senior thesis. Though Mansfield could not recall the topic of Cotton’s paper, he said he well remembers Cotton’s propensities as a student.
“He’s very tall and he sat in the front row, so you couldn’t miss him,” Mansfield said. Cotton is six foot four. “He leaned forward, he had a very intent expression, watching, and he liked to talk, to raise a question. Not the simple question but the pressing, probing [one].”
“He [also] came to office hours, not everybody does that,” Mansfield added.
If Trump loses to Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton on Nov. 8, enabling Cotton to launch a presidential bid in 2020, the senator’s chances of success are far from clear, according to political experts.
“Cotton has been mentioned on the potential ‘wannabe’ list for 2020, but that assumes that Trump loses and assumes lots of other things, which are right now not really calculable,” Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said. “Because, if Trump doesn’t win, it’s really cloudy to figure out where the GOP is going to go. I mean, where does the party pick up the pieces after this really fractured time for them?”
Kyle D. Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, agreed with Miringoff. Kondik noted that although Cotton has the “right profile” for Republican primaries, given his conservative views and his “hawkish” attitude towards foreign policy, the senator’s likelihood of winning the nomination is dependent on “where the party may want to go in 2020.”
Mansfield said he thought the current “split” in the Republican party might benefit Cotton as “someone new who hasn’t been on the scene before.”
“He’s quite young, maybe too young,” Mansfield said. “On the other hand, an early try at [the presidency] might still be to his advantage.”
While an undergraduate at Harvard, Cotton wrote for The Crimson’s Editorial Board, penning a 1996 article about another tall, ambitious politician from Arkansas: Bill Clinton. In the article, titled “Clinton’s Politicking Is Sincere,” the young Cotton displays an enthusiasm for both Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Cotton wrote that Bill, “as Springsteen would have it,” was “born to run” for office, and characterized Hillary as “more organized, more disciplined, more thoughtful, and more faithful” than her husband.
Cotton explained why he believes Bill is the most “successful campaigner of our time,” citing the former president’s sincerity, “fortuitous sense of timing,” work ethic, willingness to seek counsel, and “political savvy.”
“Arkansas has 75 counties and more than 5,000 voting precincts; Clinton knew the demography and politics of every one of them,” Cotton wrote. “On drives through the state with friends, he liked to tell them the vote counts he got from each precinct, and why he got them. No kidding.”
Today, one suspects, Cotton could do that, too.

“These guys aren’t used to losing.”
So said Harvard football coach Tim Murphy last Saturday, minutes after the final whistle had sounded on Holy Cross’s 27-17 victory over the Crimson.
“These guys” referred to the Harvard team—now 4-1 and no longer invincible. And “aren’t used to losing”? Hardly was that phrase a reflection on the personality of players. It was, instead, a dry fact.
Stretching back to 2011, the Crimson had claimed 16 straight nonconference games. Stretching back to 2013, the program had taken 16 straight road contests. Both streaks screeched to a halt in Worcester, Mass., against a Crusaders team that had lost a star quarterback and three running backs but still managed to beat the No. 15/20 team in FCS football.
Harvard apologetics will point to the plague of injuries that have befallen the Crimson. Watching from the sideline were senior quarterback Joe Viviano (knee), junior running back Semar Smith (lower leg), and sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley (leg). It’s a good bet that the three starters will return for Princeton next weekend, but last Saturday Harvard missed their playmaking abilities.
Whenever a first-string quarterback, workhorse running back, and top wide receiver go down—which, by the way, doesn’t happen often—a team has enough excuses to justify a blowout loss. It’s tempting to view the Holy Cross defeat in this light, as a meaningless scrimmage in which the Crimson conceded defeat.
Fundamentally this view is wrong. Onstage with Murphy at the post-game press conference were defensive back Sean Ahern and halfback Anthony Firkser—two senior leaders who bully opponents on the field but speak in respectful tones afterward. They looked dog-tired after the game on Saturday, which made sense because they’d just taken off their helmets.
But this particular fatigue was both physical and spiritual. It’s tiring to sprint around for 60 minutes; it’s also tiring to exit Holy Cross’s stadium and realize that the dream of a perfect season has died with the last snap.
Think losing to the Crusaders doesn’t mean anything? Try telling that to someone who has 360—no, make that 300—minutes left in his career. Every tick counts.
An aura of confidence surrounds undefeated football teams. Deficits seem fluky, and comebacks seem inevitable.
That’s how it felt to watch the 2015 football team. That group had too much talent, creativity, and willpower to lose. Even in the Dartmouth matchup last October, with the Crimson down 13-0 and facing a desperation fourth-and-12, the team still seemed capable of pulling off the win.
And Harvard did, scoring 14 straight points in what surely ranks as one of the greatest comebacks in school history.
Emotionally I’m still trying to make sense of the Crimson’s loss to Penn last year. Watching the program for a season, I believed in my gut that Harvard would always win. Give the team enough time—an extra quarter, maybe—and the Crimson would always rise to the top.
After Holy Cross, I don’t have this same feeling about Harvard in 2016. Players have talent and hunger. Coaches have an intimate knowledge of personnel. Most importantly, team leaders like Ahern and Firkser have that quality that Murphy refers to as “grit.”
But I have no idea whether the Crimson will win the Ivy League. Last season felt like a foregone conclusion; this season feels like a grind.
The offensive line is banged up, missing a couple of opening-day starters; already the unit faced the challenge of replacing three All-Ivy seniors. Against the Crusaders, Harvard allowed six sacks and three backfield tackles that led to fumbles. Collectively the visitors rushed for 29 yards on 26 carries.
On special teams, the Crimson has struggled on coverage. Holy Cross speedster Jake Wieczorek racked up a 39-yard kickoff return and a 21-yard punt return on Saturday. Overall Harvard ranks sixth in the Ancient Eight in opponents’ kickoff return average and seventh in opponents’ punt return average.
At times, tough defensive play has compensated for other shortcomings. But weaknesses threaten this unit, too.
Ever since Penn wide receiver Justin Watson broke for a spirit-crushing, 79-yard sweep last November, the Crimson has struggled to stop sideline plays. In an earlier win over Georgetown, Harvard conceded two long touchdowns on a quick screen and fly sweep; in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s contest, the Crimson let up a 36-yard rush to the outside, eventually allowing the Crusaders to build a two-score lead.
The middle of the secondary has also proven vulnerable, as Cornell quarterback Dalton Banks and Holy Cross quarterback Geoff Wade have sent long balls over the top. Generally the squadron of defensive backs and safeties has exceeded expectations, playing with verve and intelligence. But the long completions hurt.
Make no mistake—a healthy Harvard team possesses immense talent. Firkser and Shelton-Mosley look like high school kids playing in a peewee league; Viviano can really fling the ball; linebacker play improves each week; and despite the praise of opposing coaches, the defensive line remains shamefully underrated.
And again, the greatest cause for hope is that this team has “grit.” The 2016 Crimson won’t give up without a fight.
So far no game in 2016 carries more implications than the upcoming Princeton matchup. The Tigers are talented, motivated, and a serious dark horse to win the Ivy League. Last week they manhandled a Brown team that had hung tough with Harvard in week two.
If the Crimson cruises to victory on Saturday, then I’ll gladly shut up. But something in me senses that a battle looms. Already I can hear the crunch of footsteps and see the glint of helmets.
Harvard players aren’t used to losing—fair enough. On Saturday we’ll see whether they know how to win.

It’s 1 a.m. and you’re cramming for that midterm at 10 a.m. tomorrow, looking at Powerpoint slides you’ll never remember and memorizing terms you’ll soon forget. Even if you, like most other students, end up leaving that Monday morning midterm defeated, stressed out, and on the verge of tears, take solace in the fact that your college career is not over - you will have many more opportunities to procrastinate and put yourself in the same unfortunate situation again. Flyby has some advice for those who might not have done as well as they hoped on the midterm (and we’re serious):
Hope for the Best
The first step for getting over a potentially poor performance on a midterm is not to catastrophize. When you come out of the midterm, your first instinct will be to frantically check your notes, striving to figure out what you got right and what you got wrong. Don’t do that. It will only serve to create more stress and, moreover, may give you a skewed perception of your performance. You never know how much (or how little) partial credit will be given or how generous your TF or grader will be feeling. Even if you feel like the world is falling apart, wait until you actually get the midterm grade back to start stressing out.
Remember the Harvard Curve
The curve is a Harvard undergrad’s best friend. When everybody does badly, everybody does well. It turns a 62 on the first Ec10 midterm into a B+ and an 84 on the Stat 110 midterm into an A.
Seek Help (Beg the TF for a Better Grade)
If you are really disappointed with your midterm grade go talk to your TF. At minimum, he or she can help you understand what you got wrong and how you can improve on it in the future. Sometimes, a TF will even let you do corrections to make up some of the points you lost. Don’t be worried about asking for help and go in with an open mind because no matter what, it will be a helpful experience.
Focus on the Next One
Although this the hardest part of the process, but it’s also the one step that will ensure you don’t have to repeat this process. When your next midterm or assignment is coming up, remember that you had trouble last time and take steps to do some extra preparation. This may consist of starting to study a few days earlier, going to extra review sessions, or meeting with your TF to go over practice questions or difficult concepts. Although the life of a Harvard student is busy, even a small bit of extra preparation will go a long way to ensuring that you leave your next midterm with sanity intact.
And remember, since midterm season is basically endless, there's always the chance to do better next time. Good luck “studying”!
