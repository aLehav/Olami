After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my first failures at Harvard was my audition for the Harvard Jazz Bands my freshman fall. Like many of my bright-eyed and bushy-tailed freshman compatriots, I had little reason to believe that the successes I had had in high school would be any less easy to come by in Cambridge. I had made either the alternate or primary bass chair in the Colorado Small School All-State Jazz Ensemble twice, played in a jazz band for seven years, and taught piano for six. How bad could my audition be?
The answer was “very bad.” The audition was combo-style, meaning a bassist, drummer, pianist, and guitar player who had just met selected a standard out of the jazz repertoire and played it together. We were barely four measures into the tune, and already the guitar player and I were both hopelessly lost. Clearly, I had a very different conception of what a “standard” was, because I had genuinely no idea what the form or structure of the tune was. Needless to say, I was not accepted into the ensemble.
I quickly realized I didn’t quite have the chops or the music theory knowledge to compete with some truly talented and prodigious musicians here at Harvard. Music has always been a hobby for me and not a lifestyle. Nonetheless, the lessons I learned from jazz have influenced much of my thinking on success, failure, and community even in my other adventures and interests.
For example, in the U.S. Army, 10 minutes early is on time, and on time is late. I learned and lived that mantra far before I ever put on my cadet uniform, though. When middle school band rehearsal started at 8 a.m., that meant we were seated and ready for the downbeat at 8 a.m., not waltzing in with Starbucks and putting our instruments together at 8 a.m. Mercy, mercy, mercy on you if you strolled in at 8:03.
My band teacher was not a drill sergeant or a whistle-blowing coach, but a true mentor and teacher who wanted us to take pride in what we did as musicians, and learn what it meant to be a professional. Punctuality reflects a professional attitude, and showing up early demands no talent. Jazz was something worth doing well, and we would get out of it whatever we put in.
Innovation and improvisation demand preparation and practice. For example, the fluid, creative, and high-tempo attacking game that my rugby team strives to play is only made possible with hundreds of running line reps in practice. Again, it was first in a jazz band that I began to understand that making something look effortless required a lot of effort.
There are specific blues and rhythm chord progressions, main “heads” (the non-improvised sections), and other structural elements that give every song a musical blueprint for improvisation. You must know these frameworks and forms and theories like the back of your hand. To contribute something valuable to the musical conversation (or any conversation), you must put in the work to be prepared.
In that sense, jazz is a language that is learned, like French or Spanish, primarily by individual learning effort. But the ultimate point of language is to communicate with others. There comes a point where you must practice your Spanish skills with another speaker to advance your knowledge, and in the same way, you will not become a better musician without playing with people who are better than you. I can run around a rugby pitch by myself all I want, but I won’t improve or have any fun without other players.
The best jazz musicians, I think, are not necessarily those individuals who can play the most complicated repertoire, or flashiest phrases and solos, but those who “say” something valuable every time they play and bring out the best in other musicians. They’ve done the work and the practice to be able to do that easily. That’s what jazz is about—sharing an experience with other people as you draw from common knowledge, while adding your own colors and flavors.
The most important thing that my band teacher taught me, though, was that no matter what—no matter how lost or off-tempo you are or how many wrong notes you play—you must keep playing. At the very least, I’m glad to say that kept my fingers moving during that unsuccessful audition and attempted to get back on tempo and on form. No matter what, we must keep playing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Among the many events during the 2016 election, the controversy surrounding Pepe the Frog stands as the most bizarre and yet most illustrative of the current sociopolitical landscape. A harmless meme that was widely used across the Internet since 2005 was appropriated by the alt-right, leading the Clinton campaign to designate Pepe the Frog a hate symbol. The resulting mockery of Democratic presidential nominee Secretary Hillary Clinton—and the left more broadly—was swift. This incident highlights a problem with Democrats and the Left: despite having won the culture war, their image is weak.
By an ideology or a political movement’s “image” or aesthetic, I refer to the vague sense of identity given by its rhetoric, actions, symbols, culture, and particularly ideology. Consider the arguments made against President Donald Trump near the end of the election. Many of the arguments made by establishment Democrats and Republicans were that his policies were infeasible and unjust, arguments based in logic and morality. Yet, these arguments were cliched pleas to policies and values, which voters viewed as broken, and which they philosophically and culturally rejected.
Trump and the alt-right, by contrast, had more compelling aesthetics. The Trump movement projected the image of a patriotic strongman, someone who would “Make America Great Again,” and whose vulgarity and no-compromise attitude displayed confidence and competence. The alt-right considered themselves “dangerous” tricksters who rebelled against political correctness. For lack of a better phrase, both of these movements seemed to be having fun, enjoying and taking pride in their movements against the “elites” rather than viewing them as a serious mission.
Although the Obamas once significantly influenced the left’s image through pop culture, there is no longer anything to the movement except some vague ideals and a general antagonism to Trump. This has left an opportunity for others to define the left’s image by referring to more extreme positions. Consider the discussion surrounding cultural appropriation. While there may be valid concerns regarding the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and theft from original artists and cultures, the controversies that enter the public eye are over cafeteria food and Halloween costumes. To the less politically active citizen, the left is characterized as “no-fun” at best and hysterical at worst; the aforementioned right-wing movements seem better by comparison.
This does not leave the center-left off the hook either. Although some would consider liberal, late-night talk shows to define the left’s image, for example, this argument fails on two fronts. First, they have little appeal beyond their left-leaning audience due to polarized media habits. Second, the increasingly fragmented media landscape keeps any one show from defining leftism at large like Jon Stewart did. While the far left may be seen as “hysterical” and without a central image, the center-left’s image is now considered boring at best and cringe-worthy at worst, especially given some of Clinton’s attempts to use pop culture.
The left needs a new image for today’s culture wars, beyond just re-articulating and broadening already-held values. First, the left can’t be known for its more extreme positions. While the ideals motivating those positions may be valid to the left’s base, they are not only unpersuasive to the those who do not hold them, but also tarnish the movement’s image. The left does not have to renounce these views but rather de-prioritize them––lest the movement risk losing political and popular support needed for more pressing issues. But while this will make the left less aesthetically toxic, the left must still coalesce around a compelling image.
Richard Spencer’s visit to the University of Florida serves as insightful case study. While left-leaning media and activists reacted negatively and alarmingly, Spencer coolly reveled in the commotion, laughing that his arrival was being treated like “hurricanes and invading armies and zombie apocalypses.” When students demanded that he be disinvited and tried to drown out his talk, Spencer was able to present himself yet again as the dangerous rebel and the free-speech hero. Yet, a student stunned him and tore down his carefully manufactured image as the stylish rogue by asking how could he believe in white supremacy “given how ugly all of you guys are.”
The issue with the images of Trump and the alt-right is how gaudy they are. Their patriotism manifests in childish disputes with athletes. Their rebellion manifests in saying mean words on the Internet. This doesn’t mitigate the harm from their ideologies or actions, but pointing out the hollowness of their aesthetics makes them less attractive by exposing the sheer effort in forcing their image.
Doing so requires poking fun at the bluster inherent to those ideologies without becoming smug and condescending. However, this can best be done by taking a more laissez-faire—but no less concerned—attitude. Many policies proposed by Trump and the alt-right are condemned as racist, sexist, and xenophobic, but such concerns are dismissed as leftist hysteria. A less dismissible argument is that those policies are overly concerned with the actions and existences of private citizens, an attitude which is reflected in their broader, domineering aesthetics. If they want to cast the left as hysterical, prove them wrong and cast them as overbearing.
In short, the left needs to learn how to be cool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only a week of classes remains before reading period, the College’s semesterly week-long period for students to prepare for final exams. As we’ve previously opined, reading period occupies a special place on the Harvard calendar. It is in many ways a time of contradictions, with festive House formals competing for space on students’ Google Calendars against intense studying. With that in mind, administrators should enact policy changes to ensure that students have the most productive, enjoyable end of semester possible. Conversely, students themselves should take action to maximize what they get out of this time of year.
Most tangibly, administrators should clarify their policies regarding professors’ abilities to assign homework and sections during reading and final period. This time has been specifically set aside to give students an opportunity to focus on their studies, and it is inappropriate for professors to expect students to attend.
We also urge professors to think strategically about when they schedule final projects, papers, and midterms in the build-up to finals season. Science of Living Systems 20: “Psychological Science” traditionally holds its final exam the Monday after Thanksgiving break, making what should be a restful holiday instead a stressful time packed with studying for hundreds of students each fall. Professors should try to find alternatives, such as holding exams immediately before Thanksgiving break or several days after, to enable students to enjoy their vacations. After a long semester—which, unlike most colleges, does not include a fall break—students deserve a few days to unwind and spend time with family.
Students should also tend to their mental health during what can be a stressful and overwhelming time of year. Despite the importance of academic success, mental and physical health should always be students’ first priority. Students should be aware of, and take advantage of, existing mental health resources such as Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services and Room 13, a peer-counseling service.
We also encourage students, particularly freshmen, to avoid falling prey to Harvard’s sometimes toxic academic culture. Harvard students often compete to prove they are more stressed and more studious than their peers. This approach is counterproductive and unhealthy. There is no shame in getting a full night’s sleep or taking a few Netflix breaks - indeed, doing so often yields better results than simply reading through one’s notes repeatedly. When it comes to studying, quality matters more than quantity.
Students should thus consider staying away from the tense, silent study rooms of Widener Library or glorifying all-nighters in Lamont Cafe. (No one gets actual work done there anyway.) Instead, find a comfortable space where you feel productive and relaxed, work with others who are supportive, and create a positive study environment.
Reading period is an excellent time to learn how to balance being a person with being a student. We urge students to carve out time to celebrate the holiday season and be merry with friends. Use this time not only for reading, but also for dancing, eating, and making spirits bright.

The Cambridge District Court will relocate its “homeless court”—the venue where Cambridge judges hold trials for homeless individuals—from the Salvation Army on Mass. Ave to the First Parish Church in Harvard Square in early December.
The homeless court aims to provide a more accessible location for homeless defendants, who often do not have access to transportation, meaning they sometimes cannot make court dates at the Cambridge District Court’s primary location on the Mystic Valley Parkway in Medford, Mass.  Repercussions for missing a court date include arrest.
The Homeless Outreach Program of the Cambridge Police Department coordinated the move with the Cambridge District Court, the Harvard Square Business Association, and First Parish Church, according to Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the business association. Judge Roanne Sragow will preside over the court’s new location, Jillson said.
Jillson said the homeless court is moving to Harvard Square because the court’s previous venue, the Salvation Army, can no longer accommodate the body’s proceedings. She added she thinks the central location of the First Parish Church means the newly relocated court will better serve the homeless population going forward.
First Parish Church Minister Adam L. Dyer said he agreed.
“We’re situated in kind of a perfect position in Cambridge. We’re very, very centrally located, so we’re easy for people to get to,” he said.
Dyer said the First Parish Church became involved in the homeless court after he personally reached out to the Cambridge Police Department to express interest in supporting “any kind of positive or restorative justice model” in Cambridge.
“We’re eager to have good relationships, first of all, with the homeless population that live around the church,” he said.
Jillson said she is also excited for the homeless court’s impending move to Harvard Square.
“They do such great work, and, more importantly, their rate of recidivism is just impressive,” Jillson said. “They’re also making a difference in the community because there’s less petty criminal activity."
Dyer said he believes hosting the homeless court helps fulfill the church’s mission. He added First Parish also hosts the Y2Y youth homeless shelter, a Harvard student-staffed group which opened in 2015 to serve homeless young adults in the Harvard Square area.
According to a report published by the City of Cambridge, over 500 people experienced homelessness in Cambridge on January 27, 2016. Of that population, nearly 70 remained unsheltered.

Seniors in the division of Social Sciences dominated the newest honorees of the College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa with 42 percent of the selected group.
Members of the Class of 2018 who study in the divisions of Science, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Arts and Humanities represented less of the “Senior 48” compared to last year.
Alpha Iota, Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter, selects 24 juniors each spring and 48 seniors each fall to join the national academic honors society. The chapter honors students who have “chosen the most challenging courses available, pursued independent research as part of an honors concentration, achieved excellence in coursework across all academic divisions, and attained outstanding grades in all courses,” according to the College’s Handbook for Students.
Brian W. Cornyn ’18 said he was surprised to learn he had been inducted into PBK.
“It was a quite humbling experience to even be considered, given how often I’m blown away when working with solid students,” Cornyn said.
Cornyn was one of four new seniors in PBK concentrating in Economics. The concentrations with the highest representation were Economics, Government, Mathematics, and Social Studies, with four concentrators each among the inductees.
Overall, the members of the “Senior 48” are pursuing 24 of the 49 undergraduate concentrations.
For Gabriella A. Germanos ’18, academic diversity was one of the centerpieces of her path through the Women, Gender, and Sexuality concentration.
“WGS is pretty difficult so I like to balance taking those intellectually rigorous courses with more lighthearted, fun classes,” Germanos said.
Germanos added, “For a lot of people, it’s challenging to take classes outside of your concentration because you are used to things in your concentration, but I’ve found it to be the opposite.”
Another PBK honoree, Hannah Byrne ’18, agreed that taking courses from different academic areas was important to her path. After first declaring a Mechanical Engineering concentration, Byrne switched to Earth and Planetary Sciences at the end of her sophomore year.
“There’s incredible support from this department, and I’ve met some of the nicest people I’ve met in college,” Byrne said. “It’s the strongest community of people that I’ve come across here, so I think that was mainly what drew me.”
The students will be formally inducted into the society in a ceremony on Nov. 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has filed an application to continue the “installation of steel, concrete repairs and concrete demolition” between the hours of 6 p.m. and midnight for the Smith Campus Center, an indication that the University is taking new steps to meet its fall 2018 opening date for the renovated student center.
Currently, construction takes place during business hours, and Harvard shuts off Holyoke St. between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m.
On October 12, 2016, the University filed for a similar noise variance to allow for “drilling, crane, sledgehammers, access equipment and diesel truck for deliveries” through March 15, 2017. The most recent filing, however, calls for more extensive work during the requested hours.
The Smith Campus Center construction has taken a toll on some local businesses, while the noise has posed a problem for some students who live nearby.
En Boca, a Mediterranean-inspired tapas restaurant on Holyoke  St., was forced to close its doors just eight months after opening due to slow business. The restaurant is suing the University, alleging that the University failed to adequately inform them of the scope of the construction. Harvard contends that it took several steps to receive feedback from and inform local businesses about the construction.
Although most neighboring retail stores will be unaffected by the proposal, the extended construction hours could impact nearby restaurants that see peak business in the evenings, as well as students living nearby.
Earlier this semester, Dean of Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen, along with the Harvard University Construction Mitigation Team and Apley Court’s proctors, purchased noise-cancelling headphones for the 30 freshmen living in Apley Court, which is across the street from the Smith Campus Center. Students in Apley said that the earlier morning construction affected their ability to sleep.
Other dorms abut the construction site, too. Harvard students live in Wigglesworth entryways J and K, as well as swing housing above JP Licks, which are both directly across the street.
Discussion of the noise variance application was postponed until the next License Commission meeting on Wednesday, November 29 at 3 p.m.

University Marshal Jackie O’Neill, Harvard’s chief protocol officer and master of ceremonies, will retire in December after more than 40 years at the University.
A veteran Harvard administrator, O’Neill has previously served as the University’s associate vice president for state and community relations, chief of staff to the president, and senior communications consultant to the Allston Initiative. She took the position of University marshal in 2004 under former University President Lawrence H. Summers.
As the tenth University marshal, O’Neill led the Wadsworth House office responsible for welcoming foreign dignitaries, organizing Harvard-wide events, and providing information on the University’s traditions and ceremonies.
Announcing O’Neill’s retirement, University President Drew G. Faust commended O’Neill’s dedication to strengthening the University’s institutional ties both in Cambridge and around the world.
Faust also announced that Margot N. Gill, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ first administrative dean for international affairs, will assume the role of interim marshal until June 2019.
In her 13 years in the marshal position, O’Neill represented the University president in matters of protocol by welcoming distinguished guests to Harvard. In the past few years, she hosted heads of state and senior officials from countries including Sweden and Tanzania.
The marshal’s office reported that last year it arranged for 129 total visits from 52 countries, hosting 847 dignitaries like government officials, university leaders, and professionals in various fields. As Harvard continues to expand its global reach, the office expects to receive even more visits from individuals and delegations seeking to learn more about Harvard, according to the report.
O’Neill also played a leading role in organizing important University-wide events. She oversaw three presidential inaugurations, planned Harvard’s convocation honoring former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela and former U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and in 2011, organized the University’s 375th anniversary celebration. Each year, O’Neill has also orchestrated the ceremonial Morning Exercises of Commencement, during which officials confer University degrees.
Faust said she is grateful for O’Neill’s “super organizational skills” that helped create “special moments and memories” for members across the University.
“With warmth, wit, and wisdom Jackie has also demonstrated time and again her ability to knit our own Harvard community together in celebration, to mark transitions, and to honor our history and traditions,” Faust said.
Gill, the interim Marshal, currently presides over international initiatives of the Faculty of Arts and Science by working on behalf of the school as a liaison to foreign governments, international corporations, and NGOs. Previously, Gill served as the administrative dean for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for more than 20 years. She also held positions overseeing the College’s international programs.
According to Faust, Gill has “a long history at Harvard” and “a deep knowledge of the University's international and local activities” that make her well-positioned for the role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76  criticized the Republican tax overhaul in an email sent to Harvard affiliates last week, warning the legislation would “broadly reduce benefits that support higher education.”
In the email, Garber discussed how various measures in both the Senate and House version of the bill could affect students and staff at Harvard. Several measures in the House bill, in particular, could affect how the University supports its students.
Passed on Nov. 16, the House bill ends the tax reduction for interest on student loans and consolidates credits for higher education expenses. It also repeals the tax-exempt status of the “qualified tuition reduction”—tuition lowered by a university for its employees and paid graduate students.
Harvard currently practices this type of tuition reduction, giving out roughly $45,000 per year to each graduate student, though that amount drops to roughly $12,000 after the first two years of a Ph.D program.
If the bill becomes a law, these tuition grants could be counted along with graduate students’ stipends as taxable income, a change which would push students into a higher tax bracket.
The Senate will soon vote on the new tax plan. While the Senate Finance Committee has approved the House’s measures, the Senate version of the bill does not currently designate tuition reductions as taxable income.
Garber wrote that, if students’ tuition assistance is counted as taxable income, students would pay a significant portion of their income as taxes.
“The resulting tax burden would be grossly disproportionate to the stipends received by most students,” he wrote.
The Republican plans would also make the University’s endowment taxable, which Garber sharply criticized.
“In both the House and Senate, the tax bills include an unprecedented tax on the net investment income of the University, including the endowment,” Garber wrote. “Under current proposals, we estimate that the cost to Harvard next year would be $43 million.”
Harvard affiliates, ranging from University President Drew G. Faust to Harvard’s student unionization effort, are decrying the bill and urging Congress not to make it law. Garber wrote that Faust spent several days in Washington this month lobbying lawmakers about the legislation.
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, the University’s student unionization effort, organized a phone bank on Nov. 10 to lobby against the proposal. The union plans to hold a rally on Wednesday. Afterwards, HGSU-UAW will hold a phone bank to call members of Congress.
A message on the union’s Facebook page says the tax plan includes a “giant tax hike on graduate students.”
“The bill would double or even triple many students’ taxes, making graduate school an unaffordable proposition except for those already independently wealthy,” it reads.
Garber wrote he and other administrators are still deciding how to respond if the Senate passes the bill.
“In the meantime, we are monitoring this legislation closely and considering how to move forward should this bill become law,” he wrote.
