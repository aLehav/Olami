After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS—As my plane landed into Paris-CDG airport and I entered Europe for the first time, I thought, “This isn’t that different.” The airplane’s wheels rolled on the usual asphalt. Familiar shrubs lined the area. Airport terminals jutted recognizably out of the buildings.
As I rode the Roissy bus to the Palais Garner and looked out my window, my thoughts remained focused on the undeniable similarities between France and other places I knew. The hotels and warehouses outside Roissy reminded me of a similar collection I found surrounding the Salt Lake International Airport. And as the bus passed Paris’s outskirts, the small roads, ubiquitous motorcycles, and industrial apartments above every building’s first floor storefront made me think of Ho Chi Minh City.
Approaching Paris, my thoughts drifting toward my home and ancestry, I felt my fears of travelling abroad alone dissipate. I was just continuing my studies, I told myself. It wouldn’t be any different from traveling across the country for college. This sense of safety and familiarity disappeared as soon as a group of teenagers tried to pickpocket me—an unsettling event that propelled me into reality.
Despite some similarities to home, Paris was very different. Such realizations continued as I signed my class contract vowing to only speak French for the entire trip, as I started having broken conversations with locals, as I took a Saturday night stroll along the Seine and saw the rowdy yet classy picnics lining its bank.
Home remained in my thoughts and offered me relief. But now was the time to learn Paris’s rules, to master its language, and to explore its culture. It was a frightening prospect—but it was time that I took the leap and dove into new waters.

HARTFORD, Conn.—In my first three weeks here at the Hartford Courant, I have grown acutely aware of a few unpleasant things. Among them are living examples of some hard realities in this industry: Journalists in general are not particularly well paid, and with newsrooms suffering from a financial crisis which hasn’t healed nearly as much as global markets have, reporters can’t count on job security like they used to.
I knew of these issues before I started here, but at the Courant I’m interacting with them all on a more personal level. I was surprised to run into reporters, at the Courant and at other outlets operating here, who rather casually told me stories about being laid off at one point or another, of getting the call and packing their belongings into cardboard boxes. These are good reporters with great sources and reputations. Not even they were immune.
I’m an intern, which means some people here think they need to give me advice (they are right, and I will take it). Perhaps the most often piece of guidance comes in the form of a joke. “You’re still in college? Find another career,” some here have told me with a nervous laugh. Often it is hard to really tell how much they are joking.
There are certainly some issues in this business. But still, at the Courant  the barriers to me doing my job with some level of competency are few and far between. People usually call me back. Lawmakers occasionally run from interviews, but they don’t stay away for long. Even my friends here who like to tell me to find something else to do “while you still can” concede the following: This is one fun job, days are rarely boring, and few things beat a byline on top of a story you are proud of.
I’m having the time of the life. But elsewhere, some of my colleagues (a word I use loosely) simply aren’t.
Let’s start in Washington, where the Courant used to maintain a bureau but cut that staff after the recession. I dream one day of writing from D.C. (and bureaus there certainly make sense for some outlets), but it is hard to argue with the Courant’s cost benefit analysis. Ron Fournier, the conservative-leaning columnist for the National Journal, said during a visit to The Crimson this spring that, in his opinion, each successive presidential administration has further limited the access of the reporters who cover it. The White House press pool, he and others say, may not be a great place to be if you want to break news. And let’s not even talk of the White House’s policy for photographers.
The Obama administration’s poor treatment of journalists has gone beyond tightening access. Under the president’s watch a reporter, James Risen of the New York Times, is currently being threatened with jail time for not informing on a source. Last year, it was revealed that the justice department secretly obtained phone records of Associated Press reporters. These tactics have been called Nixonian; I’m not sure you can argue convincingly against that characterization.
Internationally, some journalists are doing even worse. The jailing of reporters in Egypt by a government the United States has embraced as an ally is troubling on many levels. Too often, I think, intrusions of this type are ignored until somebody we know, or can sympathize with, or who speaks the same language as we do, is caught up in it. That happened this month when three Al Jazeera English journalists were sentenced to long terms on bogus charges with no evidence.
Right on cue, I and others became outraged and educated on a problem that has been happening for months. Al Jazeera says that over 200 journalists are in jail worldwide, including 14 in Egypt. First and foremost we must feel for all the professionals who are behind bars simply for doing their jobs. On a more selfish level, these staggering numbers challenge my romantic conception of journalists traveling the world, breaking stories, and having a blast.
As I sit in here in Hartford, reading about jails and wiretaps but blissfully spared from it all, I have found myself thinking of these journalists in the United States and around the world who are taking real risks, or who at least find themselves in really risky situations. These recent events, and the extent to which they contrast with my lucky experiences here, have me considering the darker side of the profession more than ever before.
The money problems challenging journalism can, in theory, be fixed. The real challenges of this profession come from governments who forget the importance of a truly free media. I hope we’re not forgetting that here, and I hope other nations currently moving in the wrong direction aren’t yet a lost cause.
Let’s keep the scores of journalists behind bars in our thoughts and prayers. I wish them the great luck I have had so far.

BARILOCHE, Argentina—Sometimes you have to climb a mountain to really see where you are in the world.
“I think we’re almost to the panoramic point,” I tell my friend, gesturing over my bike to a turn-off further up along the universe’s most arduous hill.
It is, in fact, not the panoramic point. So we press onward and upward, trailed by a string of raggedy dogs. “There’s always gonna be/ Another mountain,” I think to myself as I ride. “Always gonna be an uphill/ Battle.” Miley Cyrus, no matter how much you twerk, you are privy to some certain truths.
I’m not really sure why these dogs are following us, but a dog is the most loyal and trustworthy friend there is, so whatever. Also the white boxer and the one that looks like a sheep are biting each other again.
As an American abroad, I have learned many things on my journey up the mountain of cultural discovery. I have learned not to expect that other cultures will share my customs. For example, this dog does not know that it is rude to run growling front of my bike, nipping at my heels. I consider gently explaining to him that this is not how things in done in our country, but in the end I check my privilege and pedal onward. Sigh.
At the panoramic point, eating cheesy bread, I discover the dogs have abandoned us. Another milestone on the route of becoming a global citizen: Careful whom you trust.
Not to be deterred, we brave adventurers embark once more and soon encounter a formidable obstacle: the universe’s most arduous climb (but for real this time). I am starting to decide that life is a series of uphill struggles, including hills that look deceivingly flat at meter zero, but that suck the life and soul out of you when you actually get going.
“Almost there! You can do it!” says my traveling companion (that would be one Alana I. Ganz ’15, my ever-encouraging and much-more-fit friend whose brown hair is flowing in the wind). Sometimes it’s no pain, no gain. This doesn’t appear to be one of those sometimes, however. I jump off and join a line of Brazilians walking their bikes up the hill.
I realize I was wrong, life is in fact like a series of uphill struggles punctuated with panoramic points. We have reached yet another one, and I am fixing my hair for a Facebook photo shoot while gazing out at the crystal clear lake. Up here, breathing in the fresh mountain air, I feel my perspective shifting.
I swing my gaze to a man nearing my bicycle, and though I have learned in my time abroad that other cultures are great, I’ll be hot-damned if I let some dude run off with my bike. I abandon the vista to stand guard.
The rest of the day is a blur. However, through the sweaty film coating my eyes, I do recall seeing some giant dinosaur statues, and an Argentine who learned English listening to Blink 182 and Green Day—and selfies, lots of selfies.
On the bus back to the city, after hours spent subiendo and bajando (as they say it here—one must always attempt to adopt the behaviors of the host population; when in Argentina, do as the Argentines!) the beautiful lakeside hills of Bariloche, we drag our exhausted bodies onto the bus. But no! The conductor is telling us we don’t have enough bus fare on our cards! We glance around, helpless and naïve in this vast mundo. (You should really know that one.)
Then a voice behind us is offering his bus card. I try to pay him back, but he says something in Portuguese I do not understand and shoves me away.
I realize that the random kindness of strangers is something that you can find anywhere in the world. I realize that actually we are maybe not that different after all. I realize that I probably should have calculated how much money to put on my bus card and also that this man will enjoy a long laugh with his grandkids about these stupid Americans he saved from certain death in front of a luxury hotel.
There’s probably a lesson somewhere in all of this, which I promise to share, once these five Advil and that little something extra kick in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 1, 2014, at 11:57 p.m.
A 23-year-old man was arrested last Friday on charges of aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with an alleged sexual assault on the grounds of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain.
The man, Ashton Davis of Roxbury, pleaded not guilty when arraigned at the West Roxbury District Court Friday, according to the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office.
Boston Police had responded to a call around 11 a.m on Thursday when a female college student unaffiliated with Harvard said she had been sexually assaulted and robbed at knifepoint within the arboretum grounds. The Harvard University Police Department did not respond to the crime scene, per an agreement with the city.
Davis was later apprehended with the assistance of a GPS bracelet that he had been ordered to wear in another pending sexual assault case opened in February, District Attorney’s Office spokesperson Jake Wark wrote in an email. The previous case “also involves a sexual assault on a lone female,” according to Wark.
Davis had been held on $25,000 bail until April, when the judge reduced his bail to personal recognizance at the petitioning of his lawyers, according to Wark. On Friday, Judge Mary Ann Driscoll set bail for the most recent case at $50,000 and revoked the previous bail, guaranteeing that Davis will be held for 60 days.
His next court appearance is set for July 29.
The Arnold Arboretum was established in 1873 as a public-private partnership between the City of Boston and the University, operating as both a botanical research institution and a public park. It is a National Historic Landmark and one of Frederick law Olmstead’s most well-preserved landscapes. The site houses a library and research facility, with a full-time staff of 75.
According to Jon M. Hetman, director of communications for the arboretum, the Boston Police Department is responsible for the facility’s security under an agreement between the University and the city.
“We were horrified to learn that a visitor to the Arnold Arboretum was assaulted on the grounds in Jamaica Plain last Wednesday morning,” Hetman wrote in an email to The Crimson.
