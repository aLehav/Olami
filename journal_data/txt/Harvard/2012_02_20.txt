After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health researchers recently found that one in ten children whose activity choices and interests differ from typical gender norms have a higher risk of being sexually, physically, or psychologically abused, and of suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, as children or later in life.
“The message needs to go to parents that they need to find ways that they can protect and support their children if they’re gender nonconforming because the discrimination and abuse that these kids experience has lasting impacts on their health,” said lead author Andrea L. Roberts, a research associate in the Department of Society, Human Development, and Health at the School of Public Health.
“Schools also need to teach tolerance and work hard to prevent bullying,” she said.
According to Roberts, past research has suggested that people are uncomfortable with gender nonconformity and may discriminate against those who fall outside of gender norms.  Parents may become harsher in an attempt to change their children’s behavior to better conform to gender stereotypes.
Nearly 9,000 young adults answered a questionnaire in which they self-reported their childhood behavior and interests.
The questionnaire asked participants—whose average age was 22—to recall their experiences from before age 11, including favorite toys and games, roles they took while playing, and television or movie characters they admired or imitated.
They also answered questions about physical, sexual, or emotional abuse that they may have experienced throughout the course of their lives, and were screened for PTSD.
Roberts said that children who are considered “unusual”—including children who are disabled—are often targeted by sexual predators. Children who are gender nonconforming may also be at risk, she said.
Despite common assumptions about gender nonconformity in childhood, 85 percent of the children who were gender nonconforming identified as heterosexual as adults.
Men and women who ranked in the top 10th percentile of childhood gender nonconformity reported a higher prevalence of abuse compared with those who ranked below the median of nonconformity. Young adults who were gender nonconforming in childhood faced nearly twice the risk rate of PTSD than those who followed the norms of gender expression.
Victor G. Carrion, an associate professor at the Stanford School of Medicine, wrote in an email, “beyond screening for adverse childhood experiences, the pediatric and mental health community need to engage in policy and legislation that protects these children and educate their parents.”
Carrion acknowledged that regardless of sexual orientation or role identity, children are also vulnerable during periods in which they are exploring their identities if they do not conform to societal expectations.
“The message is tolerance, protection, and support,” Roberts said.
The nationwide study’s results were published on Monday in an online edition of Pediatrics, a research journal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the University continues to announce details of its planned reorganization of its library system, which will include staff reductions, a transcript alleging to show a virtual conversation between University officials and a concerned library worker sparked confusion and distress among library staff last week.
The chat, which was circulated among library employees in print and by email, purportedly depicts University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton, writing together under the moniker “Alan_Garber_and_Helen_Shenton,” responding callously to questions written by “Angry_Librarian.”
Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary L. Kennedy said in an email to library staff that Garber and Shenton did not actually participate in the typed conversation.
In the chat, the account claiming to be Garber and Shenton wrote, “life is full of risk. accept and move on,” in response to a question asking how library staff can decide whether to accept the University’s early retirement offer without hearing full details of the future of their current library jobs.
The screen shots of the conversation that were circulated depicted a practice session carried out by staff members who would be responsible for transcribing Shenton and Garber’s responses in an upcoming virtual conversation, according to a University official. Those staff members were testing the HARVie chat program the day prior to the actual online chat, the official said.
The HARVie chat system is a moderated online forum through which employees can communicate with Harvard officials or other individuals.
A link to view the live chat had already been shared with library workers in advance of the Feb.15 conversation. Some employees had entered the chat room a day early while the test was underway, said a library worker who clicked on the link and witnessed the test conversation live.
In an email sent to library staff Friday, Kennedy apologized for the incident and said it “had been addressed with the individuals involved.”
“Some of those test questions, and the answers entered, were understandably distressing and offensive to members of the Library staff, many of whom are anxious about the changes that are being implemented in their areas,” Kennedy wrote. “This is both unfortunate and not in keeping with Harvard’s culture.”
A majority of library employees interviewed for this story said they doubted the official explanation.
“People are losing their fear of management because they’re outraged,” said Jeffrey Booth, a library employee. “They’re not believing the official story, and that’s creating a lot of anger.”
Desiree A. Goodwin, a library assistant, said she found the University’s explanation inadequate.
“An IT staff member wouldn’t be playing around on an important project like that,” Goodwin said.
Goodwin, along with other library staff, pointed to the British spelling of the words “colour” and “flavour” in the chat as evidence of what she believes was Shenton’s involvement. Shenton formerly worked at the British Library.
The chat also attributed less polished sentences such as, “We are realigning our resources to ensure blah blah blah,” to Garber and Shenton.
Library employees have circulated copies of the chat by email and in paper form. Two library employees said that copies of the transcript had been slipped under the doors of their offices.
The Crimson interviewed nine library employees located at four different libraries for this article. Eight said they had seen the transcript.
Robert Angilly, a library assistant, said he believed that the consternation over the transcript has distracted library workers from more important transition issues.
“If I’m going to take offense at something, I’m going to take offense at what they officially say,” Angilly said. “And there’s a lot to take offense to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Echoing the spirit of solidarity, about 20 members of the Occupy Harvard movement exited Lamont Library together as a group at 10 p.m. on Friday. They had occupied Lamont since Sunday evening to protest planned staff reductions in Harvard libraries.
Protestors said that Friday marked the end of the occupation in Lamont.
Anshul Kumar, a graduate student in sociology, said that the occupation was “effective” and “productive” for a number of reasons.
“Those of us who are already active in the movement were together in the same space again and were able to share ideas fluidly, while also reaching out to members of our community who we hadn’t been in touch with before,” Kumar said.
Protestors said the library workers were “overwhelmingly supportive” of the group’s effort—baking them cookies, participating in the movement's "Think Tank," and wearing occupy pins.
According to Kumar, the motto of the Lamont occupation was, “Take a break. Think.” He said the occupation provided a venue for people to re-conceptualize and problematize the issues at hand.
But during their one-week occupation of Lamont, protestors said they encountered some bumps along the way.
The University on Monday warned the protestors that they could lose their library privileges indefinitely if they continue to sleep in the library overnight. Doctoral student Andrew J. Pope said the University did not pursue the matter further “once it became apparent we are not going to be leaving.”
And when Harvard administrators told the protestors that they were not allowed to have any sleeping paraphernalia, including pillows and sleeping bags, the protestors blanketed themselves in pink Snuggies.
“We thought the pink Snuggies would be a humorous response to the administration,” Pope said.
Andrea L. Delgado ’15, who often comes to Lamont Library to study, said the protestors’ presence in the café had no impact on her.
“I saw the sign outside, but that was about it,” she said, referring to a banner hanging in front of Lamont Café that read “No Layoffs” in the front and “No Cuts” in the back. “I didn’t even know they were here.”
One HUPD officer was on guard inside the café throughout the night.
Around 10 minutes before the library’s closure, protestors put on their coats, gathered the signs, and shouted, “Let’s all leave together.”
Although nothing definitive has been planned yet, protestors say there will be future occupations.
“As we continue to grow and evolve, we will evaluate on new places to occupy as a group,” Pope said. “The occupy movement is an ongoing process.”

From Flyby, the five top things to do on your day off, both related to the holiday, and not.
1. Chocolate—A Taste of Presidential History
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 1715 Clough House at the Old North Church in Boston. Free.
This interactive demonstration will exhibit the ingredients and tools  that people used to make chocolate in the 1700s. You can even taste hot chocolate made  with the same recipe that Presidents Washington and Jefferson savored  during the 18th century. The event is happening at the Old North Church  in Boston, the famous Revolutionary War site where Paul Revere saw the  lamps hung "one if by land, two if by sea." The church will also be hosting a Colonial Printing Demonstration for Presidents' Day where historians will explain how printing helped  spark the Revolutionary War. Two history lessons in one—a pretty sweet  deal.
2. Franklin Park Zoo PreZOOdential Election Week
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Franklin Park Zoo. Tickets are $16.
The Franklin Park Zoo is celebrating Presidents' Day through their  very own election—the PreZOOdential Election (get it?). The Zoo will be  electing a "president" of the zoo animals and they already have a host  of promising candidates including Jockamo, a male giant anteater,  Isidoro, a male Brazilian ocelot, and Stella Luna, a female red panda.  Assert your right as a voter and head out to the Zoo to make sure the  best candidate wins. If you can't make it to the event, make sure you  fill out the absentee ballot by emailing your candidate of choice to AnimalPresident@zoonewengland.com.

First, there was Aristotle. Then, there was Freud. And now, there's...the iPhone? The last may seem an unlikely candidate to revolutionize the field of psychotherapy, but  if Harvard Psychology Professor Richard J. McNally and other researchers have their way, the smart phone could revolutionize the field of psychotherapy.
According to The New York Times, researchers have been developing therapy apps designed to help those who suffer from chronic anxiety and depression. The apps focus on reprogramming the brain to avoid potentially harmful stimuli. For example, some apps train people to skip over angry faces in a crowd, which, research suggests, could alleviate severe social anxiety.
Not only do these apps have the potential to help millions of smart phone owners who might otherwise not seek out treatment, but they also have the potential to help them in only minutes a day—some apps require under an hour of use per week.
So for anyone who has ever wanted psychotherapy on the go, you may be in luck—these apps could be efficient and effective without cutting into your Angry Birds time.
