After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear President Bacow,
As newly-admitted students to the Harvard College Class of 2024, we would first like to express our immense gratitude and excitement in joining the Harvard community. The chance to live and learn at Harvard in the near future has been a light amidst these otherwise uncertain and unprecedented circumstances.
We would also like to thank you for introducing us to Harvard through the Virtual Visitas programming. During your welcome speech, you had indicated that if on-campus learning remains unsafe in the fall, Harvard would begin the upcoming term online, and this sentiment was mirrored by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in the statement released Monday. We would like to respectfully express our desire that the Harvard 2020-2021 fall semester be postponed rather than held online. Though we recognize the immense challenges and difficulty in deciding the fate of our fall semester, we sincerely hope you take our thoughts into account.
As first-year students, we have yet to establish meaningful in-person relationships with classmates, faculty, advisors, and other mentors who will facilitate the transition to Harvard. The fall semester, for many of us, will be our first introduction to college-level courses. Adjusting to college academics and social life is challenging under normal circumstances, and starting the upcoming semester online would make this transition more difficult. Aside from simply introducing us to campus life, we have also been told that the first-year fall semester is one of the most formative periods in our four years at Harvard. We would truly appreciate the opportunity to experience it in its entirety as previous classes have.
We are also especially concerned with how an online semester will impact various disadvantaged members of our class, particularly those who are coming from first-generation or low-income backgrounds, struggling with learning difficulties, lacking sufficient access to technology, residing in different time zones, and/or living in unstable households. We fear that beginning instruction online would exacerbate inequalities existing among members of our class and may have long-lasting effects. In contrast, Harvard’s on-campus resources help level the playing field, allowing all students to fully engage in the learning process.
As students, we have noticed a rise in anxiety and depression that has adversely affected the academic performance and well-being of ourselves and our high school classmates since the introduction of online learning. Requiring incoming students to begin new and rigorous course loads under already emotionally turbulent circumstances may intensify these challenges to our mental health.
Though we would prefer a delayed in-person semester over an online one, we acknowledge the financial implications of a postponement and thus support spending decisions that benefit all members of the Harvard community. In particular, we value concerns regarding the impact a delayed semester could have on Harvard employees’ salaries. We hope that, regardless of what academic schedule is ultimately chosen, the administration takes measures to continue prioritizing the financial security of its faculty and staff. As for students, we would also like to emphasize the importance of certain financial aid resources — including medical insurance — to address needs during time off-campus.
While we all hope for classes to resume on campus as usual in the fall, we recognize that Harvard must comply with public health directives and look out for the safety of its students and employees. Should a contingency plan be needed, we hope you will take the Class of 2024 into account and consider postponing the fall semester instead of conducting it online. In the worst case, if the University finds it unavoidable to conduct another online semester, we hope that there will be consistent discourse between the administration and students to ensure a smooth transition. Regardless of the outcome, we trust that Harvard’s administration will act in our best interests, and we will, of course, support any final decision.
Respectfully,
Concerned Students of the Harvard College Class of 2024

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long day. A thousand thoughts are burning in my head and the stress of the upcoming week starts overwhelming me. I sit down on my bed, pick my favorite notebook, and start writing. The slow speed of writing allows my intrusive thoughts to gradually queue up to be expressed, and I patiently listen to everything my mind has to say. After a few minutes, my body comes to the present moment, and I allow my feelings and thoughts of that day to be gradually channeled through pen onto paper.
Journaling has long been a way for me to reflect, take moments to myself, or simply calm down. Through expressing what is going on in my life at that specific moment, I am not only able to reflect on the current situation and allow my mind to sort through its thoughts but also to visit my past thoughts and aspirations. Coming to Harvard, I have become even more convinced of the importance of reflection through journaling. But due to the business of campus life, I often found myself too caught up or even too tired to bring myself to journal consistently at school. Quarantine has freed me to once again write and reflect on what the past year brought my way and how it has shaped me. Reading back on the entries I have written in college reminded me of the struggles adjusting to the first semester and the joyful moments spent with friends later on. I reconnected with little pieces of myself found in words written months ago.
As college students, we are going through one of the most shaping and definitive periods of our lives, discovering ourselves and exploring our interests. Yet, with the busy schedule and the endless goals we set for ourselves, we too often move from one destination to the next, constantly chasing the next milestone rather than appreciating the journey that led us here. Journaling is one of many ways through which we can reflect and rediscover our initial aspirations. The present downtime and relative quiet provide an opportunity to pause, look back on the moments that brought us here, and get a clearer picture of what’s ahead.
Now is a unique time to be living through, and journaling could be used as a means of documenting fraught and unique present experiences. Two of my instructors shared George Saunders’ “A Letter to My Students as We Face the Pandemic” with perfect timing; the letter so aptly describes the importance of keeping records right now. Saunders writes, “Fifty years from now, people the age you are now won’t believe this ever happened (or will do the sort of eye-roll we all do when someone tells us something about some crazy thing that happened in 1970.) What will convince that future kid is what you are able to write about this, and what you’re able to write about it will depend on how much sharp attention you are paying now, and what records you keep.”
Although it is true that our days in quarantine are rather uneventful — with the main activities being cooking or Zooming — the thoughts and emotions stirred in response to the new normal are not. As Saunders continues, “all of the drama is happening in private.” The things that should be documented and preserved are the inner struggles evoked by this prolonged pause on our usual lives.
By reflecting and documenting, we free our minds and release our thoughts and emotions. With all the uncertainty around the future and the multitude of feelings that come with quarantine, a page in our journal holds a space for us to just be. Being present with our thoughts and feelings through writing and actually allowing them to be expressed rather than suppressed becomes another way to honor and accept our experiences during these times.
So I encourage anyone who is interested in reflecting, documenting, or taking care of their mental and emotional space to grab a journal and write whatever comes to mind. It does not have to be eloquent or even make sense (nothing is making sense right now), but I promise even a few minutes a day to spend with ourselves will be worth it.

Harvard is piloting a new grant program that will provide funding to Allston-Brighton nonprofit organizations working to address urgent needs exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, the University announced April 24.
The Allston-Brighton Emergency Response Grant is a one-time grant of up to $5,000 that will be given to nonprofits that serve Boston neighborhoods. The grant program, administered through the Harvard Ed Portal, has received more than 10 applications since its opening on Friday. The first round of recipients were notified Tuesday.
“This new program will provide much-needed support to groups and organizations that are responding to the needs of the Allston-Brighton community,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in a press release. “We are eager to assist people on the front lines who are caring for their fellow citizens as we all continue to confront the challenges posed by the pandemic.”
The grant application highlighted funding for technology resources, educational programs, food preparation and emergency equipment.
Alex Cornacchini, executive director of Allston Village Main Streets — an organization that assists neighborhood businesses and one of the first recipients of the grant — said the $5,000 the organization has received will support its own relief grant, dubbed the Workers Relief Fund, allocated for workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This grant fund was established a few weeks ago to help out Allston workers that have been furloughed or laid off by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Cornacchini said. “We’ve had around 56 recipients so far, so this $5,000 will go a long way to helping out a lot more people from Allston.”
“A lot of our workers that rely on tips and are working paycheck to paycheck have no financial recourse right now, so this grant just provides a little bit of a security blanket to them while they’re kind of in limbo,” he said.
Andrea Howard, chief executive officer of the Allston-Brighton youth development agency West End House, said the organization has used the grant money to continue offering meal services for underserved families. West End House previously ran an afterschool meals program which has since transitioned into a grocery delivery service in the last two weeks.
“Harvard was early on helping us build our capacity and getting us a freezer,” Howard said, adding that West End House plans to use additional financial support from the grant to purchase and transport food from a food bank.
Howard said the agency has successfully continued its meals program in this new format.
“Last week we provided a week’s worth of meals for 585 people,” she said. “That’s over 8,000 meals we were able to provide through our grocery delivery.”
Grant applications will be accepted on a rolling basis through May 21, with decisions made within a week of submission.

Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 will extend Massachusetts's stay-at-home advisory through May 18, continuing the state's attempt to quell the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The stay-at-home advisory, first announced March 23, was originally slated to expire May 4. Baker announced the advisory two weeks after he declared a state of emergency in Massachusetts as a result of the COVID-19 crisis.
In addition to the advisory, Baker has extended his order closing non-essential businesses through May 18. Gatherings of more than 10 people remain prohibited.
Baker said in a Tuesday press conference that social distancing and quarantine measures have seen success in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
In the same press conference, Baker announced the creation of a reopening advisory board to advise his administration on reopening strategies once the pandemic abates. The 17-person committee will produce a report by May 18 detailing potential plans for a phased reopening of the state economy.
“This reopening advisory board is a step in the right direction,” he said. “When the data shows us we’re getting ahead of this terrible virus, we can take swift, smart, and appropriate action.”
Despite the advisory extension, Baker said he remains optimistic about safely reopening soon.
“I know pushing these dates back a couple of weeks is probably not what many people want to hear,” Baker said. “We all look forward to stepping in front of this podium to tell you that we’re starting to open for business. I know that we’ll get there soon, but we have to be smart about how we do it and recognize and understand that there are risks associated with going back too soon."
The state reported more than 1,800 new cases on Tuesday, as well as 150 additional deaths. Despite these increases, Baker said the number of hospitalizations has plateaued in the last 13 days.
As of Tuesday evening, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health reported 58,302 confirmed cases and 3,153 COVID-19-related deaths in the Commonwealth.
Baker said he is aware that the closing of businesses and the stay-at-home advisory have caused hardship across the state, but he advocated the orders’ necessity.
“People have lost their jobs, their careers, and, in some cases, their businesses that they’ve worked on for many years,” Baker said. “Not acting, however, was not an option.”

Medical centers around the United States will begin testing a cheap and easily produced nasal swab for COVID-19 diagnostics designed by scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute next week.
Wyss researchers created the design using injection molding, a manufacturing process that is likely to make the tests less expensive and faster to make than previously used nasal swabs.
Wyss Institute Director Donald E. Ingber wrote in an email that the new tests could be half the price of standard nasal swabs, and up to an eighth of the price of 3D-printed swabs.
Based on the results of the trials, the new swabs are estimated to be produced at a rate of 200,000 per day by May 15, according to a press release by the Institute.
The researchers involved are working with eight hospitals and testing centers, where the swabs will be tested and compared to other swab designs.
Richard Novak, a Wyss senior engineer and lead investigator on the project, wrote in an email that he hopes the new swabs will make a significant impact on testing rates in the United States.
“Our goal is to alleviate the current need for increased testing to reduce the incidence rate of COVID and enable a better understanding of infections to allow reopening,” Novak wrote. “While faster and less invasive tests are being developed and approved by the FDA, nasopharyngeal swabbing is still the gold standard, and testing centers in many areas are not running close to capacity, partly due to rationing of swabs.”
Among other unique features, the new design features grooves at the tip of each swab. Novak wrote that his team hopes the swabs’ new characteristics may enhance their ability to collect human samples.
“The new design should perform similarly to standard swabs in general as the grooved features serve a similar role of trapping cells, virus, and mucus as the fibers on a traditional swab,” Novak wrote. “However, I speculate that there may be the possibility of more efficient elution of the collected material from our swabs due to the lack of the dense fibers. This is just a hypothesis.”
The team of scientists worked remotely throughout the project, a system that initially presented some challenges, according to Ingber.
“In the beginning, it felt like the first battle of a major war, and there was a lot of desperation in the communications from the clinical side, and many different groups proposing many different approaches,” Ingber wrote. “But the generosity of scientists, engineers, and clinicians at both companies and in academia, in terms of sharing their time, ideas, and resources, was impressive.”
He added that the swab project is one of several Institute-led efforts to combat COVID-19.
“This is actually only the small tip of the iceberg of what is going on at the Wyss Institute,” he wrote. “Other teams at the Institute have been developing PPEs, but our largest activities are focused on developing COVID19 therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines.”

Harvard undergraduate Braeden J. Foldenauer ’21 was one of 62 college students to join the 2020 class of Truman Scholars, a prestigious graduate scholarship awarded to aspiring public servants.
Winners of the scholarship are selected based on their “academic success and leadership accomplishments, as well as their likelihood of becoming public service leaders” and receive up to $30,000 for graduate study in their chosen field, according to a press release announcing the 2020 winners.
Foldenauer said he decided to pursue a career in education this past summer, setting aside plans to go to law school. He said he plans to use the scholarship to get a doctorate in education and work on education reform as a school superintendent, a decision he said winning the scholarship affirmed.
“It's by far the proudest accomplishment of my life,” Foldenauer said. “It's also really motivating because I think that it is an affirmation of the things that I do.”
Foldenauer is involved in a variety of public service activities both on and off campus. He works in the admissions office as a member of the Harvard First Generation Program; serves as the vice president of Primus, the first-gen, low-income student union; and is a student ambassador for the Advanced Leadership Initiative.
Outside Harvard, Foldenauer co-founded a backpack feeding program in Holmes County, Mississippi that oversees “the discrete distribution of weekend meals every week for chronically food-insecure elementary schoolers and their older siblings.”
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Foldenauer said some of the programming for the scholarship has moved to an online platform — he found out he won on a Zoom call. Foldenauer said the Truman Scholars Leadership Week, usually held in May, will not take place as planned, though the Foundation hopes to reschedule it.
Despite the unusual circumstances, he said he has been “awestruck” after meeting fellow Truman awardees, albeit online.
“We've been having a lot of Zoom speed dates,” he said. “I've just been really awestruck by both the accomplishments of my peers, but also their aspirations and hearing about their passions and commitments to service.”
Foldenauer said, following the guidance of a previous Truman winner, he hoped his peers would hold each other accountable in their commitment to public service through the future.
“If at any point that private sector calls your name — those salaries are incentivizing — [the Truman scholar alumnus] said that one of the best parts of the Truman are having people who want to keep you accountable, and who are going to make sure that you keep your head on straight and that you maintain this commitment to serving others,” Foldenauer said.

After 30 years of advocacy by the Harvard Law School Immigration and Refugee Clinic, a federal appeals court recognized gender as a basis for granting asylum on Friday, allowing women facing domestic violence in their home countries to seek refuge in the United States.
Judge William J. Kayatta, Jr. of the First Circuit Court of Appeals authored the decision, which overturns the rejection of an asylum claim by Jacelys Miguelina de Pena-Paniagua, a Dominican Republic woman fleeing years of domestic violence.
The case must now return to the Board of Immigration Appeals for further review, but has set a lasting precedent.
In November 2019, the Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic filed an amicus brief in de Pena’s case which Kayatta used as the basis of his ruling.
“The court says — if you read the opinion — that it's adopted a lot of the analysis straight from our briefs, so that was really very satisfying,” Deborah E. Anker, director and founder of the clinic, said.
Nancy J. Kelly, co-managing director of the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic at Greater Boston Legal Services, said in a Tuesday interview that under United States law, people seeking asylum must prove they are refugees by demonstrating they have been or will be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.
“There has been an effort — a battle, basically — for many, many years to gain recognition that the language ‘particular social group’ should be defined in a way which incorporates cases of women who were harmed because they are women,” Kelly said.
The clinic helped draft the U.S. Gender Asylum guidelines in 1995 that allowed for asylum cases based on domestic violence against married women. The Board of Immigration Appeals incorporated these guidelines into precedent in a 2014 decision, but Attorney General Jeff Sessions vacated that precedent in 2018.
Friday’s ruling overturns Sessions’s decision. But rather than merely reverting back to the 2014 precedent— which only recognized married women in abusive relationships as a valid social group for asylum cases — the court adopted a broader interpretation that recognizes all people persecuted on the basis of gender.
“It essentially rejects the decision of the Attorney General and instead of simply reinstating the analysis that was done before it embraces a really clear, straightforward recognition that gender alone is enough,” Kelly said.
Kelly said she, Anker, and John E. Willshire Carrera — co-managing director of the clinic at Greater Boston Legal Services — first became interested in this issue after noticing a lack of cases from the Board of Immigration Appeals granting asylum to women.
“There were a number of women who were granted as, for example, derivatives on the applications of their husbands, but circumstances where women, as women, had been looked at — their cases had been looked at, evaluated, and they had been granted asylum — were very, very, very few,” Kelly said.
“We realized that women were really invisible in the asylum system,” she added.
Willshire Carrera noted that the court’s ruling advances the rights of women and recognizes rampant gender discrimination.
“As a man, I would say this is a very misogynist world, and so this is one more step in recognizing and seeing women and hearing women and really recognizing that women are harmed the way they are harmed by men,” he said.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council voted to publicize a student experience survey that will guide its future advocacy efforts during a general meeting held over Zoom on Sunday, its first in over a month.
Council secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 sent out the anonymous survey in an email to students Monday. It includes questions about students’ virtual learning experience, health, wellbeing, and engagement with student life.
According to the email, the Council will be using the results of the survey to ensure its advocacy efforts reflect the views of the student body about grading policies and options for the fall semester.
In a message to Harvard affiliates that came just hours later, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote Harvard would be open, either online or in person, for fall 2020, ruling out a postponement of the upcoming semester. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay later wrote in an email to faculty and staff that the FAS would reach a decision on its fall term’s format no later than July.
UC President and Vice President James A. Mathew ’21 and Ifeoma “Ify” E. White-Thorpe ’21 sent another email to undergraduates on Tuesday to again encourage students to complete the survey. In the email, Mathew and White-Thorpe wrote that the survey received 774 responses after the first day.
The Council designed the survey, which is designed to take 20 minutes to complete, in consultation with administrators from the Dean of Students Office, Office of Undergraduate Education, First-Year Experience Office, Harvard University Health Services, and Counseling and Mental Health Services.
Leverett House representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22, who helped create the survey, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the UC Student Experience Survey’s goals have not changed much in light of Garber’s announcement.
“I was not, and to the best of my knowledge neither were fellow representatives, aware of Provost Garber’s email announcement ahead of time, despite communicating with a number of administrators about the survey during its development,” Gan wrote. “Regardless, the survey’s primary intention is to gain a better understanding of how this transition has influenced the academic experience, extracurricular engagement, and health and wellbeing of students.”
She added that she and other Council members still hope to use the survey’s results to make recommendations to administrators about "where they should focus their time and resources" if the fall semester is virtual.
The Council also debuted a new logo and discussed revamping its website at Sunday’s meeting. The UC website has not yet been updated to reflect the activities of the current Council, including the information about current Council representatives and the current Council president and vice president.
Additionally, Mathew and White-Thorpe announced  at the meeting intentions for the Council to become active in Boston Intercollegiate Government. Boston University Student Government President Hafzat Akanni was a special guest at the meeting, where she spoke about her experiences with Boston Intercollegiate Government.
The Council also passed legislation updating its policies regarding funding procedures and guidelines for student organizations. Under the updated policy, registered social organizations are not eligible to obtain grants from the Council. The updated policy also requires club events funded by the Council’s Finance Committee grants to be eligible for the Student Events Fund, which subsidizes ticket costs to students on significant financial aid.
For recognized student organizations, the updated policy states the UC will consider an organization’s procedure for admitting new members to determine if that organization is eligible to receive funding.
The Council also passed legislation that allows it to collect budget information from recognized social organizations. According to the legislation, the Council will use the budget information to help it allocate funding.
Finance Committee chair and Eliot House representative Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 addressed concerns that organizations may underreport their finances.
“We’re going to pick a small selection randomly and audit them each year,” Ganesh said.
At Sunday’s meeting, the Council also passed legislation that would modify the constitution of the Council to allow meetings to be held during summer vacation with the approval of a majority of the Council. Previously, the constitution of the Council stated the Council would not meet during vacations or exam period. Kirkland House representative Carter H. Nakamoto ’21 proposed the legislation.
“The odds are pretty good that we are going to have to drastically restructure what the Council is going to look like — whether or not we’re back on campus for the fall — in order to take into account what has happened and the impacts it’s had on people,” Nakamoto said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has suspended some of its searches for the College Fellows Program “based on curricular needs” in light of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The University grants College Fellowships to postdoctoral scholars who have demonstrated a strong commitment to teaching each year. During their one-year fellowship, College Fellows teach within an area of specialization and pursue their own research, receiving a salary and additional benefits.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that even though FAS is suspending some searches, the College Fellows Program will “continue to operate” for the 2020-2021 academic year. Next year, FAS will have more than 20 College Fellows.
“Given the impacts of COVID-19, the FAS made determinations not to continue with a limited number of current Fellows searches, based on curricular needs,” Dane wrote.
The decision comes after Harvard switched to remote instruction for the spring 2020 semester due to the coronavirus public health crisis. On Monday, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced Harvard will be open — either in person or online — in fall 2020, and FAS Dean Claudine Gay wrote in an email to faculty and staff that FAS will decide what its format for the upcoming semester will be by July.
Still, graduate students said they were worried about suspensions of College Fellows searches in light of the dwindling job market the pandemic has created. Many universities — including Harvard — have instated hiring freezes in response to COVID-19.
Vivian G. Shaw, a College Fellow in the Sociology department, said she first noticed the loss of some positions after looking at the University website.
“I just looked at the website and saw that some of the deadlines for the College Fellows had been pushed back to May, and so it seems like because the appointments hadn’t been made yet, they were able to cancel the searches,” Shaw said.
She said although the suspension of searches does not affect current College Fellows — whose salaries and positions are already secured — it could impact Fellows seeking lecturer positions. Many College Fellows pursue permanent lecturer roles in their departments after their fellowship, according to Shaw.
“I do know that some people who are looking for lecturer positions for certain departments this year, the departments weren't able to make them available,” Shaw said. “There all these crunches at the departmental level in terms of hiring new people but it’s been difficult to say, ‘Hire new people who aren’t already in the system.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of campus's closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Harvard undergraduates have developed a “virtual postcard” project for University affiliates to share messages of reflection, hope, and gratitude.
The project — titled “Dear Harvard” — currently features a digital gallery of postcards which will eventually be printed and physically exhibited through a partnership with Harvard’s Common Spaces program when campus reopens. Students can choose to upload their own images or select a photo from an online gallery to accompany their messages, whose contents range from thank you notes, to poetry, to personal narratives about campus.
Katherine Lou ’21, one of the project’s founders, said she and her friends initially conceived of the project during the week when administrators told undergraduates they would have to leave campus.
“We were kind of frustrated that the phrase ‘Dear Members of the Harvard Community’ had become the preamble for bad news, and that there really isn’t anything connecting across Harvard except these emails that bring this bad news,” Lou said.
After formulating an informal proposal, the students reached out to Common Spaces, which manages campus spaces open to Harvard affiliates, such as the Smith Campus Center.
Julie A. Crites, the director of Common Spaces, wrote in an emailed statement that her team met the students’ proposed collaboration with enthusiasm.
“We loved how ‘big’ their idea was, the hope of the project, and the way they wanted to connect with all of the Harvard community which has great alignment with our work at the University,” Crites wrote. “We saw our role as coaching and helping our student collaborators think through some of the ‘Harvard hurdles’ that might typically come up in addition to the expanded network we could offer to the project as being part of the University’s administration.”
Lara M. Teich ’21, another of the project’s co-founders, said the medium of a postcard collection appealed to the students because of its flexibility.
“We wanted this to be as low a point-of-entry as possible, so that everyone can contribute,” Teich said. “People are sharing photos of their homes, but they are also sharing photos of cookies or their dog or a scene in Cambridge, really anything they want.”
One logistical challenge the students are currently grappling with is outreach beyond the College to Harvard’s various professional schools. Though the organizers’ current goal is only 200 postcards, they say Dear Harvard has been developed with room to grow.
Sophie C. Webster ’21, another co-founder, said the project could also potentially be adapted to serve other universities.
“The infrastructure of the website is infinitely scalable,” Webster said. “It has been built in a very modular way so that it could be deployed easily at other schools should there be interest.”
Overall — as the students continue developing and expanding Dear Harvard while COVID-19 restrictions stretch on — Vicky Xu ’20, the project’s fourth co-founder, said the experience has been “surprisingly fun.”
“I think it is such a privilege to be able to work on something and dedicate your time to making something like this project,” Xu said. “It has in a way allowed me to step outside the confines the pandemic has put me in, since I can see something that I am working on from my home being used by people across the globe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard College students suing Harvard over its sanctions against unrecognized single-gender social groups will be allowed to move forward with their lawsuit using pseudonyms, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
The students’ attorneys filed an April 17 motion claiming that “crucial new facts” about whether the students are in violation of the sanctions policy justified their request for anonymity in the lawsuit. The motion did not detail what those new facts are and Harvard’s lawyers did not protest the motion.
The two students, who are members of all-male social groups at Harvard and are listed as “John Does 1 and 2” in court records, are the only individual plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They are joined by other plaintiffs including the international parent organizations of two sororities and two fraternities, as well as the Harvard chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
The groups and the students first filed suit against Harvard in December 2018, alleging that the University’s sanctions illegally discriminate against them on the basis of gender.
Harvard imposed sanctions in 2016 on members of single-gender Greek organizations and final clubs, barring those students from accepting fellowships, athletics captaincies, and leadership positions in extracurricular groups. The sanctions, which first applied to the Class of 2021, have come under fierce scrutiny and sparked a pair of lawsuits in federal court and state court.
North American Interfraternity Conference spokesperson Todd Shelton wrote in an emailed statement that Tuesday’s ruling will enable the student plaintiffs to freely move forward with their suit.
“Today’s decision means that the courageous students standing up to Harvard by bringing this lawsuit can now participate without fear of retaliation or reprisal by their school,” he wrote.
Harvard College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to provide comment in addition to Harvard lawyers’ previous filings in the case.
Legal experts said in interviews that it is unclear what kind of new information had convinced the judge to grant anonymity to the students.
Merrick T. Rossein, a law professor at the City University of New York, said he thinks additional information played a role in the judge’s decision to grant anonymity.
“The fact that they may be in violation and therefore subject to discipline to me would be insufficient to make this an exceptional case. There are facts that we simply don't know here,” Rossein said.
Attorney Douglas E. Fierberg, who litigates college campus violence cases, said Harvard’s lawyers may not have contested the anonymity motion because there may be other information they want to keep private.
“There was some additional information that came out that at least permitted Harvard not to contest the request. And that information isn't disclosed,” Fierberg said. “Harvard has an obligation to protect student privacy but it also has an interest in protecting the privacy of its own confidential information.”
Fierberg said he thinks the judge’s order to conceal the students’ identities would not advantage one side over the other in the case.
“It’ll be decided on the law, not whether or not somebody is identified,” he said.
Tuesday’s ruling by Nathaniel M. Gorton, the federal judge presiding over the case, supplants his January 2019 decision stating that the student plaintiffs would not be allowed to remain anonymous if the case proceeded beyond a motion to dismiss. Months later, in August of 2019, Gorton denied Harvard’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
In their initial court filings on Dec. 3, 2018, the student plaintiffs wrote that they would only proceed with the case if their identities were protected. They wrote that they feared harm to their reputation and their future professional opportunities if their identities were made public, and that they believed they might face retaliation from Harvard.
Since then, the plaintiffs submitted their April 17 request for anonymity on the basis of new information that they allege demonstrates they have “a compelling need for privacy.”
“Counsel for the John Does have learned facts that they believe raise questions as to whether the John Does are in violation of the Policy and what the ramifications may be,” the motion reads. “Harvard, though currently unaware of whether the John Does are, in fact, in violation of the Policy, is sensitive to these concerns.”
As a part of the motion, the plaintiffs’ attorneys cited a March court order, emphasizing that both Harvard and the plaintiffs acknowledged privacy concerns in the case. That order stipulated that confidential information, such as the names of Harvard affiliates, must be kept private.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than one week after seeing its star quarterback officially find his NFL team, the LSU Tigers added a soon-to-be Harvard graduate to its offensive ranks.
Harvard senior Liam Shanahan will be joining the defending-champion Tigers next season as a graduate transfer. The Marlborough, Mass., native will use his final year of eligibility in Baton Rouge whenever the college football season begins.
The news was first reported by The Athletic.
Shanahan’s versatility is likely to be put to use by a team that just lost four of its five starting offensive linemen. The six-foot, five-inch, 270-pound offensive lineman started at both guard and tackle over his Harvard career. After starting all 10 games his junior year at right tackle, Shanahan started nine of the 10 games his senior year at right guard.
At tackle his junior year, Shanahan earned All-Ivy Second Team honors. The transition to right guard proved easy for the Kirkland House Economics concentrator, as his senior year was filled with further laurels. Shanahan earned All-Ivy League First-Team honors this time through, in addition to earning Academic All-Ivy League and the New England Football Writers Division I All-New England Team nods.
Shanahan will look to aid LSU in defending its national championship on the heels of a dominating 15-0 season in 2019, led by Heisman winner and recent NFL Draft number one overall pick Joe Burrow.

Formal season normally happens this time of year, but we must make do with our own home-thrown formals now that we are all safely social distancing. While we may never be able to recreate the magic that is failing to actually make it to the white tent in front of the Science Center for Freshman Formal, here are some tips on how to make a formal happen at home.
Get Dressed Up
Obviously, one of the best parts of formals is finding a nice ‘fit and getting ready with your friends and roommates. So put away your PJs and get on your best formal attire. While school formals may have a normal dress code, you are no longer bound by that at home. Use this time to experiment with what could be formal attire (bread costume, anyone?) or at least ditch the uncomfortable heels.
Play (Water) Drinking Games
Now it’s time for the pregame. While some of your standard games may be off limits at home, there’s new ways to drink (water) creatively. Go on Facebook and take a drink every time someone comments “thoughts and prayers,” or drink every time you think to yourself how much you wish you were at school right now. Get some friends on Zoom to play with you (it’s less sad that way).
Get on the Dance Floor
This one requires making a dance floor, but decorations can really just include a sign hung on the wall that says “Must be 21+ to drink.” For the authentic experience, turn your garage into the dance floor with all the lights off, blast the music, and have your family members come up and randomly bump into you or spill a mystery liquid on you. Bonus points if you can talk your dad into turning up the thermostat to recreate the sweltering heat of formals.
Eat Nachos
Every good formal ends with one thing — Jefe’s Nachos (or some other fast food, I guess). If you have access to Uber Eats or a similar delivery app, get your favorite junk food. If you are out in the boonies, get your chef on and make your go-to late night snack. Just be careful not to burn yourself if you went too hard at the pregame.
While we might lose some of the essence of formals being at home, there are still some good ways to recreate your night out while in quarantine. Have a happy and safe formal season!
