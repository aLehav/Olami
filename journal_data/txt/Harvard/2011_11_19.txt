After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Yale student driving a U-Haul struck and killed a 30-year-old woman at the Harvard-Yale Game tailgate on Saturday.
The collision—an incident that the driver’s lawyer is calling a probable vehicle malfunction—killed Nancy Barry, a resident of Salem, Mass., and injured two other tailgate attendees, Yale School of Management student Sarah Short and Harvard employee Elizabeth Dernbach.
Short remains hospitalized in serious but stable condition, while Dernbach has been treated for minor injuries and released from the hospital.
Brendan Ross, a junior at Yale, was driving the truck that was transporting beer kegs to a fraternity’s tailgate party.
According to a statement from the New Haven Police Department, Ross passed a field sobriety test. He was taken into custody after the accident but according to his attorney William F. Dow III, he was released on Saturday night and has not been charged with any crime.
Speaking on behalf of Ross and his family, Dow read a statement saying, “We extend our sincere condolences to the family of Nancy Barry for this tragic accident which appears to be the result of a vehicle malfunction.”
The New Haven Police Department’s Accident Reconstruction team is examining the truck to investigate why the driver lost control of the vehicle. The U-Haul was impounded by the police, according to the statement.
The crash occurred at 9:39 a.m. as a small crowd jostled in line to get proof-of-age wristbands and enter the tailgate.
Over the course of the morning—traditionally a time of drinking, barbecuing, and merrymaking leading up to the noon kickoff—a stream of U-Haul trucks transporting tailgate supplies drove just to the right of the crowd in order to enter Lot D, the largest parking facility at the Yale Bowl.
At times, pedestrians waiting in line to enter the tailgate were compelled to scurry out of the trucks’ path.
But as Ross’ U-Haul truck entered the lot, it turned left and accelerated quickly, according to eyewitnesses.
It struck three women on the outskirts of the crowd before hitting another U-Haul truck, which in turn hit a third.
Eyewitnesses said the truck did not slow when it struck the three victims and only stopped upon crashing into the other vehicles a few seconds later.
Ryan A. Hanley ’12 said he was standing nearby and looked over when he heard a vehicle accelerating and people screaming. After the accident, he saw several women lying motionless on the ground.
“I wanted to stay, hoping they were going to get up,” Hanley said. “I was still kind of shocked, and after that, I kind of lost it.”
Despite the fatality, the tailgate festivities continued.
As rumors spread through the partying crowd, many students were entirely unaware of the tragedy or unsure of its seriousness until much later.
Many first heard about the crash when an announcer called for a moment of silence for the accident victims and their families at the start of halftime.
Players on both teams were in the locker rooms during that broadcast and did not learn about the collision until after the end of the game, which Harvard won 45-7.
Harvard coach Tim Murphy learned of the death shortly after the game ended.
“I can’t imagine coming to a football game—a festive occasion—and something like this happens,” Murphy said. “Just so tragic, and our heart goes out to their family.”
Yale coach Tom Williams heard about the incident during halftime but decided against informing his players.
Harvard University President Drew G. Faust and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 left the game to visit the hospital to check on the status of the injured Harvard employee, according to University Spokesperson John D. Longbrake.
In a press release, Yale stated that its athletics program and college dean’s office will conduct “a full review of the policies and regulations relating to tailgating before athletic events” in response to the accident.
Yale’s tailgate policies have long been viewed as more lenient than Harvard’s.
In recent years, U-Haul trucks have been banned, along with kegs and hard liquor, when The Game is played at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been an eventful week in Harvard athletics. Championships were won. Students are leaving for “The Game.” And the NBA is back, at least for one night.
5. Lavietes Sellout
No, it’s not for a Harvard basketball game. Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo will host an exhibition game on Sautrday in what may be the only professional basketball action in Boston this year. Ticket sales will benefit Boston charities. If you don’t already have a ticket, don’t waste your time trying to get one. The event is completely sold out.
4. Shaq’s Book Signing
Shaq will be signing his autobiography, “Shaq Uncut,” at the Harvard Book Store on Saturday. The four-time NBA champion is the largest addition-by size-to the list of NBA players that will invade Cambridge this weekend.
3. Harvard-Yale Hype
The 128th edition of “The Game” is here. Thousands of Harvard students will travel to New Haven to watch the Crimson attempt to make Yale quarterback Patrick Witt regret his decision to skip his Rhodes Scholar interview. Kickoff is Saturday at 12 p.m.
2. Women’s Soccer (12-5-1, 6-0-1 Ivy)
The Crimson lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to No. 12 Boston University last Saturday. The team has a lot to be proud of though, as it won 12 games and the Ivy League championship this season.
1. Football (8-1, 6-0 Ivy)
Harvard beat Penn 37-20 last Saturday, locking up the school’s second Ivy League title of the fall season. The Crimson will look to extend its eight-game winning streak by leashing the Bulldogs at the Yale Bowl this weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most of campus made the trek to New Haven Friday evening, the Harvard men's hockey team dropped Clarkson, 3-2, on the road in Potsdam, N.Y.
The Crimson opened scoring after six minutes of play, as junior forward Erik Kroshus earned his first goal of the season on a power play.  The Golden Knights were quick to respond and 30 seconds later had a goal for themselves when forward Nick Tremblay pulled Clarkson level.
In the second period, the Crimson got its second goal through freshman forward Tommy O'Regan's first collegiate score.  Harvard maintained the lead until halfway through the third period, when a Golden Knights power play opportunity led to a goal by Matt Zarbo.
But as was the case for most of the game, Harvard made a quick response and regained the lead a minute later, when junior defenseman Danny Biega put it past Clarkson's goalie.
The Crimson would ride out the rest of the period for the win and will take on St. Lawrence tomorrow to round out the weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Maybe Patrick Witt should have gone to that Rhodes Scholarship interview after all.
The Bulldog quarterback—who last week received national media attention for his decision to play against Harvard today instead of attending the concurrent interview in Atlanta—was intercepted three times at the Yale Bowl by a swarming Harvard defense, which joined with Harvard’s highest-ever scoring offense to lead the Crimson to a 45-7 victory in the 128th rendition of The Game this afternoon.
With the win, No. 14 Harvard completed one of the most dominant seasons in its history, finishing 9-1 overall and 7-0 in the Ancient Eight.
"We got beat by a better football team today," Yale coach Tom Williams said. "That team is bigger, stronger, and faster. They've got good players at almost every position. ... They're the best team in our league, the best team we've played this year, and it showed."
After winning the Ivy title outright with a 37-20 win over Penn last weekend, the Crimson on paper had nothing to play for today. But the team nonetheless sent a talented senior class out with a resounding victory, a fitting epilogue to its a storybook season.
The win was the ninth straight for Harvard, which lost its opening game at Holy Cross but afterwards cruised through the Ancient Eight and two non-conference opponents during the rest of the year, never facing a major challenge on the road to its 14th Ivy League championship and first perfect Ivy season since 2007.
In his final collegiate game, quarterback Collier Winters went out with a bang, throwing for 355 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for one more. The senior also gained 62 yards on the ground and completed 27-of-42 passes on the afternoon, giving him a 68.6 percent completion percentage for the year that is the highest in Crimson history.
"It's been a long journey for me," Winters said. "This kind of season was something I'd always wanted to happen and I was hoping for. I'm thankful for my health in the last half the season, and the guys around me made things easy and made the season a lot of fun."
Things didn't start easily for the quarterback, who marched the Crimson down the field but fumbled at the Yale five yard line on the opening drive of the game. After the teams traded three-and-outs, Witt led the Bulldogs on a six-play drive that he finished off on 3rd-and-3 with a 24-yard touchdown strike over the middle to Jackson Liguori.
But from there, the Crimson would dominate the rest of the game, scoring 45 unanswered on its way to the win.
Winters responded to the early Bulldog lead by orchestrating an eight-play, 73-yard scoring drive that he capped with a four-yard run.
"It was annoying to cough up the ball after we got the momentum going and got things going on offense," Winters said. "But all year we were so confident in ourselves that no matter what adversity we had … we were going to be ready to keep pushing, and I think our confidence allowed us to move past it and get onto the next drive."
On the subsequent Yale possession, junior cornerback Brian Owusu stripped Liguori after a first-down reception, and sophomore Jaron Wilson recovered the fumble at the Crimson 43.
Winters then led Harvard down the field with ease once gain, throwing a 20-yard touchdown pass to senior wideout Alex Sarkisian three seconds into the second quarter to put the Crimson up, 14-7.
"There was a seam, and I just ran the route I was supposed to run," said Sarkisian, who finished with seven receptions for 97 yards. "Collier made a great play in the pocket and put the ball in the perfect place."
Special teams then began to play a major role in the game.
Witt brought the Bulldogs down to the Harvard 17, but after the drive stalled, sophomore cornerback Chris Splinter blocked a Yale 34-yard field goal try, and the Crimson took over at its own 28. On its ensuing drive, Harvard was stopped short of the end zone when sophomore tight end Cameron Brate dropped a third-down pass at the goal line, so Harvard lined up for a 22-yard field goal attempt.
But Harvard coach Tim Murphy called a fake that was executed perfectly, with junior QB Colton Chapple taking the snap and pitching back to kicker David Mothander, who sprinted along the left sideline and dove into the end zone.
"It's an easy call to make when you have confidence," Murphy said. "Our coaching staff and our players did a great job in gameplanning it and then obviously executing it."
The sophomore placekicker added a 21-yard field goal as time expired on the first half to send the Crimson into the break up 24-7.
The teams held each other scoreless in the third quarter, but late in the period, Wilson intercepted Witt on 4th-and-5 at the Harvard 30, putting a dagger into any hopes Yale had to get back in the game.
After the Wilson return, Harvard went 60 yards in six plays, with freshman Zach Boden darting untouched up the middle and into the endzone for an 11-yard score.
On the next Crimson possession, Winters hit junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk on a short pass, but Jusczcyk slipped a defender and ran 60 yards for another touchdown to put the Crimson up, 38-7. The reception gave Jusczcyk 107 yards on the afternoon and a team-high 37 catches on the season.
Witt was later intercepted for the third time by Crimson captain Alex Gedeon, who ran back the pass 32 yards to the house with 5:12 left in the game. For Gedeon, the touchdown put a crescendo on a senior season in which Murphy said the linebacker was arguably the best captain he has coached during his 18-year career at Harvard.
"That's perfection," Murphy said. "Alex Gedeon is a really special guy, as humble as they come, selfless, a great player. He is, in my humble opinion, the best linebacker in this league."
Witt was benched by Williams for the remainder of the contest, but by then, the Yale section of the 55,137-person crowd had greatly thinned out.
Harvard’s 45-point performance—its most points against the Elis since 1982—closed the book on the  most productive offensive season in the program's 138-year history, giving the Crimson 374  points on the year to break the undefeated 2004 team’s record of 339.
"Today the kids rose to the occassion," Murphy said. "I think the assistant coaches did a great job in game-planning and preparation, and it all came together. It was our day."
After the contest, while surrounded by teammates and Harvard classmates who had stormed the field in celebration, senior Josue Ortiz proposed to girlfriend Kayci Baldwin '14 on national television.
"Since we kept winning, I was [planning] to do that if we won the Ivy League and beat Yale," said the defensive tackle, who also picked up his 10th sack of the year in the contest. "I got down on one knee, and she said yes."
Ortiz was one member of a senior class that completed its careers a perfect 4-0 against the Bulldogs and gave the Crimson its 10th win in its last 11 tries against Yale.
"They were just so coachable, so relentless, so resilient, so selfless, and eventually gave us such great chemistry," Murphy said. "We got on a roll and never got off it."

Coming  to Harvard means leaving your pet at home, at least for most students. Luckily, there are  plenty of lovable pets living on campus eager for you to visit. Flyby  sat down with some proctors and resident tutors to find out more about  their dogs, already celebrities in their entryways. Come say hi if you  ever seem them walking in the Yard!

The Harvard Interfaith Collaborative plans to package 20,000 Thanksgiving meals for hungry families this Sunday in the SOCH from noon to 4. "It made a lot of sense to come back to the issue of hunger at a time when most people are gathering around a feast," said Chelsea S. Link '12, one of the organizers of the event. "We might get tired of dining hall food sometimes, but we know we have it good. Besides, to be totally honest, manual labor can be a relieving break from schoolwork."
 
The group packed 10,002 meals at its last event, on Sept. 11. Now, its members—including College and Divinity School students and Harvard chaplains—hope to double that total.
 
Each meal contains rice, soy protein, vegetables, and a vitamin packet.  "They're completely vegetarian and extremely healthy," Link said.
 
Though each meal costs just 25 cents, that adds up fast when you're trying to pay for 20,000 of them. The Interfaith Collaborative is asking for donations to cover the $5,000 cost, but so far, they've only raised 26 percent of their goal.
