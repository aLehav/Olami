After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a stark difference between performing on a live-streamed Zoom call and in the Agassiz Theater. But undeterred by the circumstances, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players are using the unusual setting to stage a return to semi-normalcy with a production of the one-act comic opera “Cox and Box; or, The Long-Lost Brothers,” which ran April 29 to May 8.
While the embrace of an all-virtual setting allowed the group to perform safely during the remote semester, it also necessitated far-reaching changes. Typically, HRG&SP sticks to shows by both W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan, a Victorian-era British duo who created 14 full-length comic operas together. However, after producing one of their typical operas proved infeasible during the previous semester, the group started looking for an alternative. “We decided on ‘Cox and Box’ mostly because it's short, it's part of the canon, and it's fairly easy to do virtually because the scenes have so few people in them,” Ria Dhull ’23, the group’s president, said.
With music by Sullivan but without the involvement of Gilbert, the show tells the story of two men: James John Cox (William P. Evans ’21), a hatter who works all day, and John James Box (Taylor Kruse ’23), a printer who works all night. Unbeknownst to each other, they share lodgings, having fallen prey to a scheme by their landlord to get double rent for a single room. After an unexpected meeting, the two discover they have more in common than the bed they sleep in, which results in much hilarious argument.
The production, which was stage directed by Samuel F. Dvorak ’23 and music directed by Veronica F. Leahy ’23, marks the first time since the Fall 2019 premiere of “H.M.S. Pinafore” that HRG&SP has tackled a full opera. According to Dhull, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic forced the total cancellation of the company’s show last spring, and last semester they showed a collection of pre-recorded numbers from “Ruddigore.”
One potential downside of the choice could have been the opera’s small cast. HRG&SP normally casts 15 to 20 people, whereas “Cox and Box” has only three characters. Fortunately, the group turned the problem into an opportunity, deciding to give their imaginations free rein and add additional scenes written in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan, featuring more characters invented by Dvorak and Dhull. “This is definitely the most creative we've been,” Evans, also a member of the board of directors, said. “I think that's a testament to what we wanted to do with the show: to make it be more inclusive and have more people.” Thanks to the change, the final cast involved 20 people.
This year was bound to differ a lot from other experiences in the 65-year history of HRG&SP, and the group came to “Cox and Box” fully aware of how much harder working remotely can be. “It's definitely been super challenging,” Leahy said. But she was quick to point out that experience helped the team to overcome the obstacles posed by the pandemic. “We are in the third semester of doing these virtual things,” she said. “Some of us were even doing virtual theater over the summer. I think a lot of us have started to realize what works and what doesn't.”
For Dvorak, the unusual circumstances “open[ed] up some exciting possibilities” despite their limitations. Because the group didn’t need to rely on the confines of a stage, it could experiment with pre-recorded video clips. “It's almost like we have 10 music videos for each of the 10 musical numbers,” Dvorak said. “They are like clips out of a movie musical. So I think that's one part of ‘Cox and Box’ that's also unique in that it uses both live and pre-recorded and tries to mesh them together seamlessly.”
The online format stimulated creativity, but it was still a huge hindrance, especially when it came to music. Rather than having people perform live, the group was forced to individually pre-record singers and musicians. “It's a very particular and tricky situation,” Leahy explained. “Because of Zoom delay, it's impossible for two people to be able to play or sing simultaneously.”
Whatever the challenges the team might have faced, to them, their efforts were worth it. “It certainly has been the highlight of a very, very dark and challenging year, and it's definitely brought a lot of joy in a gloomy time,” Dvorak said. Now, the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players hope to bring the same joy to their audiences.

Leahy Ardon (Ish Shalom) is not afraid to laugh.
“I find things funny where I shouldn’t. I find a lot of life funny,” she said with a self-aware chuckle. “I have a terrible habit of laughing out loud if I find things funny. It could be the smallest, awkward interaction between two people and I just can’t help myself. But I think it’s a healthy thing.”
As a young playwright, her works like “Conflict Zone” and “Galim” certainly show off her sense of humor. But she is by no means a comic, and laughter is just one part of her style, one that acts as an entrance to a deeper world.
After splitting her childhood between Israel and Brookline, Mass., Ardon enrolled at the Berklee College of Music, where she received her Bachelor of Music in Professional Music. Berklee describes the program as “for those interested in learning everything,” but Ardon focused on cello performance and writing drama. Ardon, 28, is currently pursuing a master’s degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, which she plans on using for nonprofit, community-building work.
Ardon also finds time to study playwriting in the English Department. On Sundays, she works on her own drama — maybe a few lines of dialogue, maybe a whole scene, but the time is reserved for creativity. Ardon draws inspiration from the incredible talent she’s seen at Berklee and Harvard. “If I have experienced their art as meaningful and thought-provoking, then I hope I can do the same for other people,” she said.
Artist, educator, and activist all in one, Ardon navigates her different roles with apparent ease. Though some of her plays could have educational elements, she tries to avoid sounding “preachy,” as she said. Her work as a playwright and performer is first and foremost artistic.
Ardon’s play “Conflict Zone: A Dramedy on Mental Health and Other Wars,” which recently won “Best of Fest Award” at the Whitefire Theater Solofest in Los Angeles, is a one-woman piece that handles the process of healing from eating disorders with a dose of comedy. Though this content would be no laughing matter for most, Ardon approaches it differently. “As much as these things can be really heavy, it does have humor in it too,” she said. This mixed style, the marriage of the macabre and lighthearted, is in line with Ardon’s worldview. Humor for Ardon doesn’t preclude serious discussion, even for some of the darkest parts of life. “I think it’s the opposite,” she said.
This style also shapes her new one-act play, “Galim” (a transliteration of the Hebrew for “waves”), which closed the Harvard Playwrights’ Festival on April 24. Set in Israel, the work deals with generational gaps, exploring the differences in how young and old see gender roles, military service, and other parts of life, in Israel. It was an impressive finale to the weeklong celebration of emerging playwrights that featured 10 professionally directed performances.
Especially in a pandemic, where “essential-ness” has become a metric for one’s career, art and artists have come under heavy fire for a perceived lack of worth. But at the suggestion of the arts as an expendable industry, Ardon laughed and said, “I think that’s bullshit,” adding a thumbs down. “Arts are what fill our soul. Does anyone really imagine themselves without art? Without their TV shows that they love? Without the beautiful designs that they see? Without a million and one things that they take for granted?”
Ardon pointed out a double standard applied to those in the arts versus other industries. An aspiring lawyer, software engineer, or chemist is lauded for simply pursuing their field, whereas Ardon described the problematic perception that artists are wasting their time until proven otherwise. “We have a different bar for success,” she said. “With artists, there is often an expectation [of greatness] that is unrealistic. It’s much easier for us to understand how smaller jobs in other industries are necessary.”
Ardon defines success for herself broadly. She has ambition, but does not view any particular position, award, or salary as necessary for her career. “I’ll see myself as successful if I can continue doing what I love and have a growing audience to whom my art means something and gets them thinking,” she said. She confessed being open to achieving that higher standard for artists, one that would lead someone to say, “Well, they’re no Leahy Ardon,” but that isn’t her only benchmark for success. “It’s not as black and white as I used to think, and a lot of people still do,” she said.
As to her future, Ardon’s outlook characteristically balances purpose, realism, and delight. “Life is full of surprises,” she said, smiling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With inspirations ranging from Earl Sweatshirt to Pablo Picasso’s “Blue Period,” Chicago rapper D2x is ready to have the world appreciate his art.
The rapper’s debut album “The Color Blue” is his most intimate work to date, channeling a diverse array of artistic influences and personal memories.
“I feel like I'm fully comfortable now to honestly just tell the true story of how I got into music and where I'm trying to go,” he said on a call with The Crimson.
Before discovering music as a freshman in college, D2x was a high school basketball player with dreams of going pro, turning down a number of scholarship offers to attend Division I Western Illinois University as a hopeful walk-on.
Yet upon beginning school and the laborious tryout process, the rapper came to the realization that basketball was no longer his passion, leading him to pursue his interest in music.
The rapper credits some of his name inspiration to the late DMX.
“I decided to switch paths and that's what initially made me go into music to find another way to really express myself,” he said. “I learned that that was something that I was potentially good at and now we're here.”
While at Western Illinois, the lack of a serious local music studio forced D2x to pursue recording options in Chicago, commuting to the city on weekends with Amtrak 10-day passes sent to him by his mother.
Even during his early college days, the rapper was always intent on producing the highest quality music, often working to perfect just two or three songs over long stretches of time.
“I wasn't like the typical guy that was super social and going to parties all the time to grow my music that way,” he said. “I was thinking about the bigger picture, really about when I graduate knowing I have to come back home. So my goal was to start from the inner-city first to grow my brand.”
After graduating from WIU last summer amidst the pandemic, D2x found a new recording studio and began honing the rhymes that would eventually populate his latest project.
Despite moving on from the goal of a professional basketball career, he noted that the sport continues to inspire his music, such as in the “The Color Blue” album cover, which features a group of cartoon children playing a pick-up game of basketball.
“I've created that connection so people could really really see what made me who I am,” he said. “And that was the purpose of even utilizing basketball in my music is to tell my story, but it also motivates me to remember my past.”
In addition to personal inspirations, the rapper is heavily influenced by musicians like Miles Davis and J Dilla as well as artists like Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat.
According to D2x, the namesake and cover art for his latest project takes a cue from “The Old Guitarist,” a painting by Picasso from the artist’s “Blue Period” from 1901 to 1904. The final track on the album is titled “Picasso Blue / Thoughts from a Basquiat.”
“It's a very moody photo and is one of [Picasso’s] most classic and legendary pieces,” he said. “It gave me an idea of how it really feels to be a musician, especially when you're trying to be different.”
The rapper’s emotional approach to his music meshes well with other Chicago MCs like Saba, Noname, and Chance the Rapper — artists that D2x hopes to work with in the future.
Recent radio play and an early affiliation with the Hiphop outlet Lyrical Lemonade have garnered D2x some attention in the local Chicago scene, but the rapper is hungry for more.
In the next year, he hopes to solidify connections with big music festivals and play the major Chicago venues like Lincoln Hall and Metro, using the “The Color Blue” as a launching pad.
“This is the best position I've been in, in my career,” the rapper said. “I am optimistic that show opportunities will definitely come.”
“I just want ‘The Color Blue’ to continue to grow and I want more people to hear and understand what it means,” he added.
“The Color Blue” is currently available on all streaming platforms.
