After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after I grow old, I’m confident I’ll never forget my daily walks through Harvard’s campus.
But with each day that passed during my freshman year, I must admit I’d grow less and less appreciative of my physical surroundings. Like any other college student, I’d easily let the day’s worries, hopes, and fears consume me, preventing me from slowing down and deliberately breathing in the crisp New England air or stopping to appreciate the painstakingly slow retreat of a seemingly never-ending Boston winter.
So admittedly, it took me a while to realize Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale” is set at Harvard—or, rather, the bleak vestiges of Harvard—after a terrifying purge culminates in a post-American nation where women are dehumanized, stripped of basic civil liberties, and relegated to being pawns of an oppressive, theocratic state known as the Republic of Gilead.
Not once in the body of her novel does Atwood mention Harvard by name. But throughout, she appears to eerily allude to Memorial Hall, a place which “used to be where the undergraduates ate, in the earlier days of the university,” Tercentenary Theatre, a lawn made up of “paths once used by students, past buildings that were once lecture halls and dormitories,” and Widener Library, whose “white steps going up are still the same, the main entrance is unaltered.”
To any reader familiar with Harvard’s campus, Atwood’s descriptions are haunting, conjuring bleak and persistent images of psychological suffocation in a place that once was a pillar of intellectual freedom. But her chilling physical descriptions of Harvard’s remains pale in comparison to the emotional associations her writing meticulously evokes.
Whether it’s nonchalantly alluding to the now-forgotten Civil War—both the great test of American democracy which Memorial Hall commemorates and the very subject of a class to which I devoted a whole semester—or wistfully remembering Harvard’s annual spring commencement festivities, Atwood paints vivid and familiar images that are painfully real, at once evoking among readers a combination of nostalgia, outrage, and mind-numbing dread.
In the dystopian world of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the Kennedy School of Government no longer symbolizes a breeding ground for civic leadership but is relegated to a venue for child marriages formerly bearing the name of “some dead president they shot.” Likewise, Widener’s iconic “Death and Victory” mural is no longer inspiring homage to those who risked their lives in the First World War but is reduced to a lackluster painting with an ambiguous message “in honor of some war or other.” Most harrowingly, Atwood transforms Harvard’s iconic Johnston Gate into the site of menacing gallows where dissidents are brutally hanged with bags over their heads, known as “the Wall.”
To anyone remotely appreciative of the power afforded by education, let alone someone familiar with Harvard’s campus, this is wholly and indubitably terrifying. But perhaps this timeless emotional robbery is exactly what makes “The Handmaid’s Tale” so effective: It’s a ruthless desecration of the familiar.
For the many of us who take Harvard’s academic eminence for granted, Atwood ruthlessly invokes and distorts a familiar idea in a manner that is at once jarring and unforgettable. And in many ways, when used carefully, this reinterpretation of familiar places, names, and concepts has the potential to serve as a wake-up call.
But the skillful employment of the familiar spans beyond just literature; in fact, when used carefully, it bears the potential to entirely alter the trajectory of conversations, to imbue dialogue with a renewed momentum, a fresh potential to convince. When we fortify our words with familiar allusions, we tap into the very heart and soul of the human experience: one framed by indefatigable memories.
In grounding far-fetched ideas in something real and tangible, we’re able to have a more far-reaching impact in our conversations, sparking profound emotion in others that would otherwise remain hidden in the shadows. When we call upon intimate memories and dare to reinterpret them in provocative, fresh ways, we prompt others to open their minds to an array of possibilities they once may have deemed outrageous.
To invoke and distort the familiar, whether in conversation or writing, is to allow for the synthesis of intimate connections among readers, listeners, and challengers that is easily overlooked when constructing seemingly alternate realities. It is to evoke a wellspring of emotion in others that runs the gamut from nostalgia to remorse. And it is to awaken powerful feelings that have been taught to lie dormant with every day that passes.
Had Atwood forgone familiarity, instead opting to construct a distant universe or situate the Republic of Gilead in the remains of a place unknown, “The Handmaid’s Tale” would be devoid of its striking realism. But because the novel dares to juxtapose a beacon of free thought and intellectual exploration with the desolate aftermath of its ruin, it taps into a well of emotion that hinges on deeply personal memories. In doing so, it strikes a chord with readers who would otherwise perceive its plotline to be far-fetched.
By reinterpreting the familiar, Harvard’s self-proclaimed quest for truth becomes a perpetual battle to silence its very exposure. Meanwhile, the vibrant freedoms accompanying the pursuit of knowledge and fulfillment are reduced to the sheer promulgation of tyranny and lies.
Through the chilling brushstrokes of a novelist’s pen, veritas becomes mendacium. Déjà vu becomes jamais vu. The familiar once again becomes unfamiliar.
Reconceptualizing the familiar is to speak to people in a language they can understand before teaching them new a dialect. It is to meet people where they are before pushing them to take on new a challenge. Above all, it is to open their minds to possibilities never before considered, realities never before conceived.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEWARK, N.J.—By the time this piece will be published, I’ll be almost 7,000 miles away from this street, this city, its people.
This is weeks late, as I’ve scoured the city and my photos looking for a glamour shot to post, something that could sum up the time I’ve been here. For a while, none of the pictures I had were quite picturesque or didn’t tell the story I wanted them to tell of Newark.
Most people only pass through the city briefly, get a glance of ‘dirty jerz’ through the airport or the train and make their opinions accordingly. Maybe they even know of Newark because of Sen. Cory Booker or its unfortunate reputation as the unfriendliest city in the world. Many believe it to be a mispronounced New York City in more ways than one.
But I’ve known this city all my life. I grew up eating arroz con gandules every Sunday in Forest Hill and buying my discount clothes on Broad Street and celebrating the Portuguese festival every year in the Ironbound. I knew this city past the views in a car window, past its reputation. How was I supposed to show to the people who are simply passing by?
So I settled on this photo; I stopped right in the middle of McCarter Highway, phone perched precariously out the window, seatbelt straining ever so slightly against my arm as I took the shot. I then continued on my way to the airport to catch my flight, peeling away against the blare of traffic.

Jake Kaufmann ’93 stepped into his role as the College’s director of financial aid Monday vowing to Harvard’s socioeconomic diversity and  “open doors for students."
Kaufmann took over from Sally C. Donahue, who retired after serving 18 years in the role.
Kaufmann said Donahue’s leadership created an “incredible foundation” for the office. He said he is particularly excited for the “opportunity to continue that incredible work we’ve done so far.”
“There’s always more to do, there are always more doors to open, more barriers to remove for students and families,” he  said.
After graduating from the College, Kaufmann worked as a consultant with Bain & Company and the Bridgespan Group. He also worked as a dean, teacher, and theater director at the Roxbury Latin School, an independent boys’ day school.
Eventually, he returned to Cambridge and earned a master’s degree from the Graduate School of Education in 2005. Since then, he has served in the Office of Admissions of Financial Aid as both an associate director of financial aid and as a senior admissions officer.
Kaufmann says his agenda for the first few months will be to “take a step back” as he jumps into his new role.
“I think right now the most important thing I can go for the next little while is to listen and learn,” Kaufmann said.
In his previous work with the financial aid office, Kaufmann oversaw the financial aid application process for prospective students and directed the process for distributing need-based aid. He also chaired a regional subcommittee for the admissions office.
Kaufmann believes “there’s a perception problem and a reality problem” that impacts the “nuanced” state of financial aid in higher education.
“There’s a lot of financial aid out there and students are making it work, but there are some real challenges,” Kaufmann said. “I think continuing to have that national conversation around affordability, around access, is incredibly important.”
