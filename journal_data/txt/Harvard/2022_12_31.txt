After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every few months, I remember that “A Game of Thrones” exists. No, not “Game of Thrones,” although I once was a fan of the acclaimed TV show (I repress an involuntary shudder as I think of the last season). I’m talking about “A Game of Thrones,” the first novel in George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series that the show is based off of.
I first discovered these gigantic novels as a nerdy 15-year-old fresh out of her Sarah J. Maas phase (don’t ask). I fell in love with the series immediately, devouring 5,000 pages of fantasy, love, politics, dragons, war, betrayal, and everything else that makes “A Song of Ice and Fire” truly legendary. I relished the grand scale of the story, set on the continent of Westeros — based on real places and events in medieval Europe — the webs of political intrigue, clash of great kingdoms, and mysterious magical forces at work beneath the surface. While “A Song of Ice and Fire” is an epic fantasy series, GRRM explores deeper themes regarding human nature with great nuance. The idea of balance plays a central role in the story: light and dark, life and death, ice and fire.
After binging the entire five-volume canon in a few months, I became obsessed. I memorized the names, sigils, words, and castle seats of dozens of Westerosi houses. I read outlandish fan theories and analytical essays that dissected different plotlines and character relationships. I drew a family tree for the Targaryen royal house after reading George R. R. Martin’s giant tomes of lore that he wrote afterwards — and yes, I read hundreds of pages of made-up fantasy history.
I cringe now as I look back on my obsessive behavior, and yet I’m weirdly proud of my total geek moment as well — I was a true fan. For my birthday, my mom bought me a special box set containing the five novels from Books-A-Million, each bound in colorful faux leather. After much bickering, I finally agreed to leave my precious set at home when I went to college, though I regret that decision to this day.
While “A Song of Ice and Fire” is truly one of my favorite pieces of art to exist, it is also the cause of my deepest anguish. For just as the brilliant, prolific George R. R. Martin is famous for writing what I consider the best epic fantasy series of our time, he is infamous for being the absolute worst procrastinator ever to exist in the history of mankind — such is the duality of man. “A Dance with Dragons” was published in 2011 (when I was seven years old), and since then, GRRM has been slowly writing the next massive tome, entitled “The Winds of Winter.” Every year, he inches closer to finishing the novel, assuring fans that “Winds” will come someday, and every year, a small part of me dies inside.
Eager for more “Game of Thrones” content while I waited, I began watching the HBO show, which ironically started and finished airing entirely within the hiatus between books. I thoroughly enjoyed the first few seasons that FOLLOWED THE BOOKS and then didn’t like the show as much when it started deviating from GRRM’s story. So of course, the last season was seriously offensive, although I don’t blame the writers for flailing without the novels to guide them. Watching the show brought my love of “Game of Thrones” more into the mainstream, although I am still one of those insufferable “the books were better” people.
Now, exhausted of all “A Song of Ice and Fire” content, having read the books over multiple times, watched the HBO show, read the companion novels, short stories, Targaryen history volumes, and other procrastination projects GRRM has started to avoid finishing his book, I am at a loss.
“Winter is coming” has taken on a whole new meaning for me. Although it’s been some years since I first picked those cursed books up, whenever I am reminded of their existence, I immediately drop everything I’m doing and feverishly search the internet for answers. I navigate to GRRM’s blog, combing through every meticulous detail, eyes roving down the page for even a crumb of information about “The Winds of Winter.” It is a tragic cycle I am doomed to repeat every month or so.
However, I am proud to say that what began as a journey of denial (reading the few sample chapters from “Winds” released online and pretending it’s the real thing), anger (complaining to my friends who literally could not care less), bargaining (watching “House of the Dragon” and telling myself it’s better than “Winds” could ever be — amazing show btw 10/10 recommend), and sadness (listening to “Rains of Castamere” on repeat as I struggle to hold back tears), has turned into cautious acceptance. Whether the sixth novel comes or not, I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to immerse myself in such an absolutely amazing book series, and I am forever thankful for GRRM for creating this (unfinished) masterpiece and still managing to churn out exceptional new content despite being a master procrastinator, which I can personally relate to as I submit this article several hours late.
Winter is coming, someday.
—Incoming Culture Exec Arielle C. Frommer will probably still be waiting for “The Winds of Winter” when you read this. Please feel free to reach out to her at arielle.frommer@thecrimson.com, especially if you have updates about “Winds.” Please.
P.S. If you want to feel better about yourself for procrastinating, just remember that “Winds” isn’t even supposed to be the last book in the “A Song of Ice and Fire” series. “A Dream of Spring” is. Let that sink in.

There are a few simple truths in life: Roosters will always crow at dawn, Floridians will never learn how to use their turn signals on 6-lane highways, and, if riding in my car, anticipate a few brief intermissions in the tracklist. In the nearly five years since a middle-aged woman passed me my freshly printed drivers license under the nauseating LED lights of the Florida DMV office, my aux cord has been broken. Yes, I’ve purchased new ones — and yes, each time they’ve devolved into unpredictable beat scratches and reverb that concern even the most talented of DJ’s.
At this point, I admit that I’m the problem — but, as a caveat, the volatility of my track list has made me reflect on which songs deserve to take center stage, if only for a few uninterrupted minutes. While my commute now features the shrieks and groans of the Boston MBTA in place of my car’s exhausted suspension system, these are ten songs that cure my seasonal depression and give me my melanin back in the dead of winter. Best of all, you can sing them even when the aux cuts out.
1. “December” (IDK): In the acclaimed television series “The Magic School Bus,” wacky science teacher Ms. Frizzle takes her traumatized students on a field trip into the human digestive system where they play around in the large intestine. If she had taken a detour into my psyche instead, they would have heard this song playing on loop. A mix of reggae and hip-hop, “December” is everything I could ever want — and more.
2. “Dragonball Durag” (Thundercat): Like velvet, soul train, and Jamaican-Black Castor Oil, “Dragonball Durag” is a time-machine to the 1970s that I can’t help entering again and again.
3. “I’m Still in Love With You” (Sean Paul ft. Sasha): From Sundays at my grandma’s house to car rides in the back of my mom’s SUV, this song is generational. It’s my grandma’s yucca, my mom’s shoulder-grooves, and my sister’s speaker blaring 30 decibels too loud.
4. “I Didn’t Mean to Fall in Love” (Snoh Aalegra): Swedish-Iranian singer Snoh Aalegra is the future of soul. Off of her 2019 album “Ugh, Those Feels Again,” “I Didn’t Mean to Fall in Love” is a never-skip, always-belt track that will surely make its way onto my 2023 Spotify Wrapped.
5. “Self Control” (Frank Ocean): A staple in my music library since 2016, “Self Control” isn’t for the faint of heart. Layering nostalgic vocals over melodic strings, it’s wistful and a little bit heartbroken — but aren’t we all?
6. “Titi Me Preguntó” (Bad Bunny): The party anthem of the summer, “Titi Me Preguntó” is for the people. If you aren’t listening to reggaetón, what are you doing?
7. “U Should” (CHIKA): This song came up on shuffle as I navigated down California 1, or PCH as the locals call it, on the middle leg of a multi-day road trip with one of my best friends. With wasabi puffs and Diet Coke littering the middle console and an Australian Siri shouting last minute directions in our ears, we watched the most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen. “U Should” feels like that sunset — oil-painted hues of pink and yellow, ocean-views, and memories in the making.
8. “YiPiYaY” (Aminé): Anyone who knows me is aware of my infatuation with Aminé. A balance of hype and introspective, he has consistently been my top-played artist for the past few years. I could’ve placed any of his songs in this slot and it would have just made sense.
9. “Love Yourz” (J. Cole): A classic, “Love Yourz” is a welcome reminder to live life with gratitude. Accompanied by J. Cole’s smooth flow and easy lyricism, I’ve never once skipped this song — and I probably never will.
10. “Small Worlds” (Mac Miller): I remember the first time I listened to Mac — I was sad, in a high school sort of way, and his vulnerability took me by surprise. This was in 2018, a few weeks before his death. A combination of funky basslines and self-reflective flow, “Small Worlds” is about being human — and all of the mess that comes with it. Four years later, his voice still brings me back to myself.

As a Chemistry concentrator, I’ve spent many a night determining ways to synthesize analogs of morphine and finding values of 𝛾 such that a pacemaker can be automated to prevent abnormal heart rhythms. The common thread between my countless hours of problem solving, aside from me questioning the life choices that led to relearning the Robinson Annulation mechanism for the eighth time this semester, is the music that has kept me sane through it all. Below are some of my favorite tracks to play on those scary pset-ing nights, ranging from classical music to rock along with a mix of new and old pop.
“Tonight, Tonight” by The Smashing Pumpkins 
The song delivers a much needed message of hope, not only instrumentally but also in its lyrics. With an encompassing drum roll and The Smashing Pumpkins’s vocalist Billy Corgan urging the listener to “believe, believe that life can change,” the song brings light to darkness. Detailing a struggle with self-doubt and a firm belief in the potential for change, “Tonight, Tonight” brings a sense of courage to listeners and reminds me that I won’t be stuck in a Lamont nook forever.
“Watch Me Shine” by Joanna Pacitti
An iconic track from the “Legally Blonde” Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, this song plays over a montage of Elle Woods working hard to pass her law school classes after an embarrassing Halloween party where peers doubted her ability to succeed. Pacitti’s backup vocals and the hip-hop style drum beat are staples of 2000s music that create a nostalgic but motivating atmosphere. Lyrically, the song is clear in its theme of ambition, vigor, and overcoming challenges. “Watch Me Shine” is a go-to song for romanticizing finishing a mile-long to-do list.
Étude Op. 10 No.12 “Revolutionary” by Frédéric Chopin
A beast of a piece to play, this étude is beautiful in its thundering, fast-paced start. The series of loud left-hand runs alongside the bright chords creates drama and excitement with only a brief dynamic respite in the last 30 seconds. While the techniques used to solve fluid dynamics problems are drastically different to those necessary to play this sophisticated work, I’m reminded of the beauty in complexity, within and beyond music, when listening to Chopin’s romantic piano solo.
“Head On Fire” by Griff and Sigrid 
A prominent beat full of energy makes this a great song for a mini-dance break after sitting hunched over my iPad in the same spot for four hours. Griff and Sigrid’s vocals interchange seamlessly throughout the track and their unified harmony works well with the added texture in the final bridge to conclude the song at a highpoint. I, too, “think I’m losing my mind” and feel like my head is on fire so the additional relatability of the lyrics is a welcome comfort.
“Probabilities” by Maude Latour 
This song off Latour’s newest EP “001” is reassuring with its affirmation of a brighter future and moving past the inevitable feeling of wanting to give up. Celebrating the little moments along with all of the randomness and chance that came together to make them happen, “Probabilities” is a healthy reminder to get out of your own head sometimes and just dance.
—Incoming Comp Director and Music Executive Anna Moiseieva will be enjoying her music pset-free until January. For further discussion on these songs or additional recommendations, she can be reached at anna.moiseieva@thecrimson.com.

Anyone who knows me is aware that if I’m not in the comforts of my mouse-infested DeWolfe dorm or encompassed by the deafening silence of my thoughts in Lamont, I can be found cycling through Taylor Swift’s entire discography. To pay homage to Taylor being my #1 artist on Spotify Wrapped for the thousandth year in a row, I present a series of each month of my year: Taylor Swift edition.
1. January: “Fearless”
After at least five years of refusing to go skiing because of my fear of getting injured, I finally felt the power of the mantra “new year, new me”… simply put, I was “fearless!” Diving ski-first on the slopes at Deer Valley, I glided down as fast as I could, feeling the breeze of the cold air whoosh past my face.
2. February: “Enchanted”
Most people associate February with Valentine’s Day. Donned in pink, I spent this day in part with my girlfriends, but mostly with my boyfriend. Whether single or taken, everyone is sure to have felt the “enchanted” feeling of meeting someone who makes your heart skip a beat.
3. March: “Wildest Dreams”
March marks one of the most momentous times of freshman year: River Run and Housing Day. The days leading up to those events were full of extreme anticipation as my blockmates and I prayed to the housing gods not to be quadded. On the night of River Run, I inadvertently set off a fire alarm at Mather House. Despite this, never in my “wildest dreams” would I have imagined getting Mather the next day.
4. April: “Forever & Always”
This month was brimming with coping mechanisms as I realized that my first year of college was coming to a close and that I would soon be back home for the summer. I also had to come to terms with the fact that I would be a Matherite “forever & always,” while my linkmates could live in the luxury of the newly-renovated Dunster House.
5. May: “Bejeweled”
In freshman fall, I — an eager-eyed student — only dreamed of partaking in the irony of formal season during reading period. Finally, I had my chance! I was certainly “bejeweled” as I bounced from dance to dance.
6. June: “the last great american dynasty”
While home, I was no longer surrounded by the laughter of my roommates and had no obligation to complete any course work. As a result, I finally gave in to the hot, cultural phenomenon: Wordle. This unfortunately marks my fall from grace… or “the last great american dynasty.”
7. July: “Cruel Summer”
Summer is my favorite season, but July was a “cruel” moment of “summer.” While driving on the 405 freeway in my brother’s car, I ended up rear-ending another car — not one of my proudest moments. Now, my brother is stuck with his dented Tesla since it takes eternity for new parts to be delivered.
8. August: “august”
After spending my summer rekindling the spark with many of my high school friends and reminiscing about our childhoods, I realized I would soon be off on another adventure: sophomore year! “august” certainly “slipped away” before my eyes.
9. September: “Mean”
While I was excited to be back on campus, sophomore slump was a genuine feeling. Perhaps it was the fact that I was without obligations for three months prior or my heavy courseload that was typical of most sophomores, but I definitely felt “mean” vibes coming from school.
10. October: “I Knew You Were Trouble”
October brought in high tensions with my fifth roommate: Mr. Mouse. Experiencing my first mouse sighting, I screamed in terror — worse than any horror movie I had ever seen. My room became adorned with mouse traps as decorations and, soon enough, I stood above a mouse caught in a trap mouthing “I knew you were trouble.”
11. November: “Bad Blood:
The shot heard round the world, or should I say, Taylor Swift’s tweet about The Eras Tour. Absolutely nobody was going to get in my way as I frantically waited for hours in the virtual Ticketmaster line FOUR TIMES to sign up for her fan presale. Luckily, on Nov. 15, any “bad blood” I had with other Swifties who were trying to steal my seat in the SoFi stadium in LA dissipated as I was rewarded with my golden ticket!
12. December: “Snow on the Beach”
As soon as I left Science Center Hall D, marking the end of my journey in the infamous Stat 110 course, I packed my bags and departed to sunny California. However, the day after I left, Cambridge experienced its first snow of the semester, so now, I am only left dreaming of seeing such a miracle: “snow on the beach.”
—Incoming Campus Exec Allison S. Park will obviously be found musing about Taylor Swift all throughout her winter break and can be reached at allison.park@thecrimson.com.

The day I pass up the opportunity to hand out unwarranted opinions about my niche (and only slightly weird) taste in music in listicle format is the day The Crimson Arts Board gets a full budget — I mean, welcome to WatchMojo! My name is Alisa, and welcome to our top 10 party songs you will never hear at any party Dj’ed by me. So sit back, take notes, and you’ll never have to worry about your aux being mistaken for a MIT frat bro’s.
10. “Everytime We Touch” — Cascada
Do I know all of the words to this song? Unfortunately, yes. Do I need to be caught lacking singing them out loud? Absolutely not. The bubbly pop is over the top, and I am not here for it unless Pink Whitney is being served.
9. “WAP” — Cardi B ft. Meghan Thee Stallion
As a certified Meghan Thee Stallion anti-fan, I can confidently say that this is the song that ruined all acronyms for me. The TikTok dance is one thing, but do you really need to hear my back cracking as I attempt my first split in 10 years? Didn’t think so.
8. “Party in the U.S.A” — Miley Cyrus
If you hear the acoustic guitar strings pluck in an E Major seventh fret, you better run. Because if there’s one thing Miley does well, it’s wrecking ball-ing every party this song plays at.
7. “Shake It Off” — Taylor Swift
Any song by Taylor Swift to be honest. I get it, I get it, she has a long list of ex-lovers she needs to get through before her career is over. Not my problem. Not my party’s problem.
6. “Timber” — Pitbull ft. Ke$ha
Okay, besides the overdone personification, what is so fascinating about someone KO-ing in the middle of the dance floor? 2012 is over, guys, so no more plank references please.
5. “I Gotta Feeling” — Black Eyed Peas
I gotta feeling that tonight is the night we say goodbye to music that sounds like it came straight out of my uncle’s 4x4.
4. “Fergalicious” — Fergie
Speaking of Fergie, didn’t we all collectively agree to never listen to her singing ever again after the NBA national anthem debacle? C’mon, Chris Rock laughing at her has gotta be a slap in the face. Too soon?
3. “Levitating” — Dua Lipa
This song had its moment. She won her Grammy. Please let it be on its “Way Out” now. Dua Lipa’s dating Jack Harlow, for god’s sake!
2. “Pepas” — Farruko
PSA TO ALL CLUB OWNERS IN THE GREATER BOSTON AREA AND BEYOND: It’s been 19 months. Please stop waving your bar towels and singing about popping pills.
1. “Despacito” — Luis Fonsi ft. Justin Bieber
*Cue Abby Lee Miller* And on top of the pyramid, going three for three, once again: Justin Bieber. Whoever thought that putting the Canadian guy who sang “I get my peaches out in Georgia” on a track with Luis Fonsi to sing in Spanish is probably the craziest (and the richest) dude there ever was. Play it at your local grocery store, at your next quinceanera, even play it at your wedding as the bride walks down the aisle for all I care — just please, please stop playing it at parties.

For the last year, we’ve published every piece under our jurisdiction in the Books section of The Harvard Crimson. But whenever we searched for the “books” tag in our website’s administration system, a mysterious category would pop up: “books and liquor.” After doing some digging, we discovered that Books&Liquor was a short-lived Fifteen Minutes series that set out to “capture students, professors, tourists, and pedestrians whose diverse sartorial expressions color the campus with flair and style” in 2011. The content tag has remained an alluring presence at Arts meetings ever since.
With our term as co-Books Executives coming to an end, it’s only fitting for us to revive this strange, spectacular section. Here are some of our favorite book-liquor pairings.
Nina’s Picks:
1. ‘The Fellowship of the Ring’ and Hot Toddy 
The warmth and sweetness of a hot toddy is perfect for revisiting this childhood classic, the first book in J. R. R. Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” series. Lemon, honey, and hot water evoke the coziness of the Shire before Frodo and his compatriots embark upon their quest, while the hint of whiskey is an acute reminder of adulthood and the challenges it brings. Much like the feeling of nostalgia, this drink is somewhat bittersweet. It pairs well with any book that brings fond memories to mind, especially in the cold weeks of winter break.
2. ‘Normal People’ and Pinot Noir 
Reading Sally Rooney’s second novel is a somber experience for anyone who’s gone through heartbreak, from watching a crush go to the dance with someone else to navigating the end of a long-term relationship. College students who struggled to find a sense of belonging on campus are guaranteed to resonate with Connell, who spends most of his freshman year as a secluded English major, often choosing Austen over social interaction. Lean into the melancholy of “Normal People” with a hefty pour of pinot noir. Sink into a comfortable chair and unwind with the smooth product of “the heartbreak grape.” Pinot noir grapes earned their nickname as a variety that is incredibly difficult to grow; the wine’s association with heartbreak makes it the ideal accompaniment for Connell and Marianne’s emotional journey.
3. ‘And Then There Were None’ and Espresso Martini 
Drinking an espresso martini is a lot like reading a mystery novel: The alcohol (the act of reading) brings relaxation, while the espresso (the suspense) provides energy and stimulation. “And Then There Were None” is one of Agatha Christie’s greatest novels, following ten strangers with wicked pasts who have been summoned to a private island. Upon arrival, they are told that they will die one by one according to an ominous nursery rhyme. The narrative lacks a detective, meaning readers must stay alert to piece together who is responsible for their deaths. Perk up with an espresso martini for this novel or any one of Christie’s brilliant creations. The book is almost impossible to put down; you’ll want that caffeine boost to get to the end.
Daniel’s Picks:
1. ‘This Side of Paradise’ and Chardonnay
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s very first novel, “This Side of Paradise” is not nearly as well known as “The Great Gatsby” or “The Beautiful and the Damned;” that does not mean, however, that it is any less worth reading. “This Side of Paradise” pairs well with a glass of Chardonnay, perfect for the refined dinner party. When the conversation turns to books, impress your hosts by praising Fitzgerald’s stylistic experiments in his first novel, or show your literary prowess by critiquing its lack of cohesive narrative structure. You might even keep your musings to yourself, and ponder Amory Blaine’s search for his own authentic self in perhaps the shallowest of settings.
2. ‘Blood Meridian, Or, the Evening Redness in the West’ and Tennessee Whiskey 
No book pairs better with a glass of Tennessee whiskey than Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece. Enjoying this drink, you’ll fit right in with the protagonist of this novel, who never skips out on stopping at a saloon as he makes his way from his home in Tennessee to the California coastline. You’ll find sitting over a glass of whiskey the perfect setting to reflect on the role that violence played in shaping the American West as we know it today. “Blood Meridian” will have you thinking long after you’ve read the final page — or, just long enough for the aftertaste of your last sip to go away, so you can pour yourself another glass.
3. ‘On the Road’ and A Nice Cold Beer
Sal Paradise and his friends in “On the Road” are always partying — what better drink to pair with this book than a cold one? Drink your beer and live vicariously through Sal and his wild best friend Dean Moriarty as they speed across the United States, basking in every moment of the all-night parties that they find along the way; the taste of college will mesh perfectly with their on-again-off-again girlfriends and constantly rotating cast of friends. As you finish the book — having finished your beer and feeling a bit warmer inside, even a bit buzzed — remember to cherish the days that could one day form the basis of your own story, inspired, of course, by Jack Kerouac’s seminal novel.

This autumn and the one before, instead
of staying in on Monday evenings, I
would watch the tree across the street turn red
as Crimson Arts production nights flew by.
I don’t know on how many of those nights
we had to walk back home through icy rain,
but now I know for sure there’s nothing quite
like taking daytime showers in champagne.
The last red leaves outside have blown away,
and this will be my last Arts vanity,
so thanks for hearing what I had to say
about the songs that meant the most to me.
I really hope that you could feel my heart
in every piece I wrote for Crimson Arts.

Death, taxes, and traffic in the bike lane between the Quad and the River. Residents of Cabot, Currier, and Pfoho are all too familiar with the fleet of scooters and bicycles making the daily trek to greener pastures, and as a recent bike owner myself, I can understand why. Not only do micromobility vehicles cut down on travel time, but they also provide us with an outlet for artistic expression like no other.
Yes, that’s right! I live in the Quad! Woe is me. Now that that’s out of the way, I’d like to reflect on my cycling journey and the lessons it’s taught me about style — a journey that began when I became acquainted with athletes who swear by the scooter.
I have them to thank for introducing me to Dartmouth pong and increasing the font size of periods to make my essays longer, but also the convenience of wheels. I resolved to buy a bike at the start of the semester and have since learned that the ten-minute cruise toward the River is rife with opportunity to enjoy art. What follows is a list of insights and recommendations for maximizing the artistic experience of riding a bike.
1. Share Something Beautiful With the World
When I first perused the racks at Cambridge Bicycle, I was lost among dozens of tricked-out rides. I didn’t think what the bike looked like mattered as much as its function, until all of a sudden, she appeared before me. Azure blue, topnotch suspension, 24 speeds — a mechanical Matisse with color and fluidity that serenaded the eyes. It was love at first sight. I had a blast with The Queen, as I dubbed her, who dazzled passersby with her luster and regality. Maybe a little too much, though. The Queen lasted about two weeks before someone decided she was too good for me, and now all I have to remember her is a sawed-through bike lock. Tough year for queens.
2. Okay So Don’t Share Anything Too Beautiful
The way your bike looks matters, but maybe settle for a work from Henri Matisse’s friend, Othon Friesz — famous in his own way but a little more subtle. I picked up a gray, rusty little hybrid (name pending; need to keep assessing the vibe) off Facebook marketplace for a fifth of the price of The Queen, and it has lasted five times as long. To decorate this bike without making it a target for theft, I wrapped some glittery Christmas tinsel around the handlebars. The brakes don’t really work, but when I cause an accident at the next intersection I fail to stop at, I can do so peacefully knowing I’ll have spread holiday cheer to all those who saw me.
3. Embark on a Musical Adventure
What better way to pass the time on a bike than bumping some tunes? My long, solitary excursions have given me the opportunity to appreciate music in new ways this semester. I let “Un Verano Sin Ti” and “Renaissance” energize me on tough rides. Sometimes I revisited oldies like “Gr*duation” by K*nye W*st to relive the glory days. One time I even listened to the “Interstellar” soundtrack so I could more easily pretend I was on a spaceship. While bikes make the streets a more colorful place for everyone, they also let you encounter more avenues of enjoying art on your own.
4. Embrace the Beauty of Nature
The outdoors possesses an artistic merit itself. My bike enables me to explore the beautiful nature areas surrounding us, like Mount Auburn Cemetery, Belmont Cemetery, Highland Meadow Cemetery, Mt. Pleasant Cemetery, Ridgelawn Cemetery, and so on. Boston’s green spaces are just so charming and alive!
5. Lean Into Cyclist Fashion
I don’t own any proper cycling attire myself, but there’s really nothing sexier than those bodysuits real cyclists wear. I don’t have much else to say on that, they’re just that cool.
I still have much to learn about the art of cycling, but there’s a list to kick things off. Not only do bikes bring art into the worlds of those you pass on the street, but cycling awakens the rider to the true artistic value of today’s music, alternative modes of fashion, and even nature itself. I haven’t biked around Cambridge in the winter or spring at all, but my wanderlust has been irrevocably catalyzed. What can go wrong biking in the snow and ice?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am an avid watcher of music award show performances. No, not music award shows, specifically music award show performances. From the Grammys to the VMAs to the BET Awards, music award show performances never fail to disappoint, and more often than not, they become important moments in popular culture. Here is my list of performances from music award shows of the last decade that stand out as iconic cultural moments:
1. Taylor Swift’s “Mean” at the 2012 Grammys
In 2012, Taylor Swift wasn’t a mega-popstar-icon yet, but she was on the cusp of a meteoric rise to stardom. Her performance of “Mean” at the 54th Grammys, before she took home multiple awards, was a triumph for the underdog country-pop singer. Swift even changed the lyric “But someday I’ll be living in a big old city” to “But someday I’ll be singing this at the Grammys / and all you’ll be is mean.” The performance received an enthusiastic standing ovation, shocking a young Swift and marking an inflection point in her legendary career.
2. Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” at the 2015 BET Awards
Kendrick Lamar’s energetic, powerful performance at the 2015 BET Awards featured the rapper’s hit song amidst fantastic pyrotechnics and two graffitied police cars. Fans praised the performance’s discussion of police brutality, but conservative anchors on Fox News used Lamar’s performance as a talking point, with Geraldo Rivera commenting “Hip Hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years.” Lamar then turned around and sampled Rivera’s inflammatory remark on his album “DAMN.”, performing the song “DNA” at the 2017 VMAs.
3. The Chainsmokers “Closer” with Halsey at the 2016 VMAs
It was bad. So, so bad. The pop-EDM duo, for some ill-advised reason, decided to perform without lip-syncing. Andrew Taggart, who performed onstage with Halsey, sounded like someone singing in the shower, out of tune but unreasonably confident. The internet had a field day with this performance, questioning how the year’s biggest pop hit flopped so badly in performance. Celebrities ARE just like us, aren’t they?
4. The Jonas Brothers’ “Jealous,” “Cake By The Ocean,” “Sucker” Medley at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards
The return of the Jonas Brothers brought back a generation of Disney Channel fans, and their first release as a reunited pop trio, “Sucker,” stayed on top of the charts for months. This performance marked the start of a new age for the Jonas Brothers, uniting hits from their solo careers with their returning single. The performance also reminded us the Jonas Brothers weren’t kids anymore, with their wives all cheering in the front row, and Nick Jonas even stopping to kiss his wife, Priyanka Chopra, mid-performance.
5. Jack Harlow and (More Importantly) Brandy’s “First Class” at the 2022 BET Awards
After dissing Brandy and calling her “Ray J’s sister,” rising star Jack Harlow made a lot of rap fans angry. However, the two seemed to make amends when Harlow brought Brandy onstage for his BET Awards performance of the viral hit “First Class.” While their newfound friendship is certainly notable, what’s more attention-grabbing is the noticeable shift in crowd energy when Brandy entered the room. The opening lines of “First Class” failed to stir the crowd, but Brandy’s verse brought audience members to their feet in seconds — it’s an incredibly magnetic and quite funny moment to watch.
6. Doja Cat’s “Say So” at the 2020 EMAs
Doja Cat’s hit “Say So” seemed to be everywhere in 2020. However, her 2020 EMAs performance revamped the genre, producing a metal/rock version of the song. After climbing out of a TV screen a la “The Ring,” Doja Cat performs the reimagined “Say So” with an absolutely enthralling energy and new aesthetic. The performance showcased the artist’s brilliant range and captivating stage presence. Mid-quarantine, the breath of fresh air and untamed creativity was exactly what audiences needed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I love living in the Quad; I wouldn’t want it any other way. However, I regret to admit that sometimes I secretly envy Adams and Quincy residents who live just a few doors down from 14 Plympton St. When I’m in Pfoho and have to get to The Crimson, or at The Crimson and have to get to Pfoho, the distance between those two buildings can seem like much more than 0.7 miles.
In general, I am a huge fan of the Harvard shuttle service — I would be nowhere without the Quad Express, Quad-Yard Express, Quad-SEC Direct, Overnight, Crimson Cruiser, and the 1636’er. Not to mention the wonderful people that drive them. Missing the shuttle, however, is a different kind of heartbreak. Here is a carefully curated playlist of songs to listen to when the Quad-Yard Express pulls away when you are just a few yards away from the door. As an extra bonus and an homage to my Crimson Arts community, all of these songs are featured in one of the many “Shrek” movies:
“Hallelujah” — Rufus Wainwright
“Baby, I’ve been here before.” The first line of Leonard Cohen’s classic heart wrenching ballad resonates as I try to count how many times I’ve missed the shuttle this week. There is nothing more humbling than missing the Quad shuttle. I realize, in somewhat of an epiphany, that no one is looking out for me but me. I didn’t properly account for how much time it would take to get to the shuttle stop, and that is entirely on me. The acoustic melancholy of “Hallelujah” sets the perfect tone as I contemplate how to get home.
“I Need Some Sleep” — Eels
There are many Eels songs featured in the “Shrek” films, and this is a particularly sad one that plays as Shrek wonders if he can fit into Fiona’s world in “Shrek 2.” The title of this song speaks for itself — when it’s midnight and I’m stranded on Mass Ave, 0.7 miles away from my bed, I can’t think about anything but how tired I am.
“Holding Out for a Hero” — Fairy Godmother version
As I watch the shuttle drive into the distance and out of sight, I can’t help but wish that someone — anyone, really, but preferably another bus driver — would materialize to take me back to the Quad. The shuttle drivers are nothing short of heroes. Honorable mention to the synth-pop Frou Frou version of “Holding out for a Hero” featured in the “Shrek 2” credits.
“Changes” — Butterfly Boucher ft. David Bowie
As a Quad resident, you absolutely must be adaptable. Everything will not always go as planned. David Bowie’s classic song “Changes,” featured prominently in “Shrek 2” when Shrek turns into a human — speaks to this: ”Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes / Turn and face the strange.” As I open up the PassioGo app in hopes of another shuttle coming my way, this song reminds me to embrace the unknown. There is beauty in the chaos.
“I’m On My Way” — Richard Price
The emotional rollercoaster of missing the shuttle aligns with the classic stages of grief: denial, as I keep running even as it pulls away from me. Sadness as I wonder why this has happened to me. And eventually acceptance, as I realize I must buck up and get myself home, even if I must walk 20 minutes in the rain. The upbeat whimsy of “I’m On My Way” reminds me that living in the Quad is about the journey, not the destination. I’ll get there, one way or another. There’s always a way back to the Quad.
—Outgoing Arts Chair Jaden S. Thompson unironically owns the soundtrack of the first “Shrek” film on vinyl, and periodically listens to it. She can be found in Pfoho during her last semester at Harvard, where she will continue to defend the Quad.

Dearest readers,
Neither of us were prepared for how fast 2022 would come and go. We know it sounds trite, but it has been the joy of our college careers to lead The Crimson Arts this year. It is fitting that in our last act as Chairs, we present the tenth annual Year-in-Review — the films, TV shows, music, and cultural moments that defined these past twelve months. As all of this art was released, there was one constant in our lives: the steady production of Crimson Arts content, and the warm and effervescent community that goes along with it.
We are immensely proud of the work that The Crimson Arts has produced this year. We published over 600 — 600! — articles in 2022. It was our first full year back on campus since the pandemic, and it was a historic year for The Crimson Arts. This was our first year covering the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Rolling Loud Music Festival, Dreamville Music Festival, as well as the Boston Underground Film Festival. We had the joy of editing some incredible concert reviews when up-and-coming artists like Lizzy McAlpine and The Driver Era stopped in Boston. We interviewed some fascinating artists like author Elif Batuman ’99, actor and singer Ben Platt, and Hollywood producer Marty Bowen ’91. We published insightful and hilarious additions to our Unpopular Opinion and What the Hell Happened series, several nuanced thinkpieces, and many beautifully crafted columns. We were continuously impressed by our writers’ wit, incisive commentary, and thoughtful approach to arts journalism.
We obviously could not have published over 600 articles on our own. We owe so much to so many. To Raquel and Jasper, thank you for always having answers to our questions and for fielding late night texts and phone calls. You put countless hours into this organization and you did it with grace. To our multimedia exec Allison and our design exec Nayeli, thank you for helping to bring our written content to life with dynamic visuals and beautiful print pages.
To our dedicated and loyal Arts execs who showed up again and again, who approached the editing process eagerly and with keen eyes — thank you, thank you, thank you. We will miss seeing you all every week. We will always think of the long hours spent at Monday production nights and smile fondly; we consider you not only our coworkers, but our friends. Production nights could have gone a whole lot faster if we sat quietly while we edited, but we could never help joking around with each other. And we wouldn’t have it any other way.
To those that came before us, thank you. Joy and Kalos, we’re sorry for still texting you with questions 12 months after you finished your tenure as Chairs. You paved the way for us and taught us everything we know. And to the compers and staff writers, the future generations of execs: Those 600+ articles would not exist without you. Nothing makes us happier than talking to a new writer who is passionate about contributing to Crimson Arts and being a part of our community. There is no doubt in our minds that we’re leaving this organization in good hands.
We bonded as a community this year in our first full year in-person since the pandemic started. We were together at the Crimson Arts Oscars watch party when Will Smith slapped Chris Rock in February. We sent links to Wordle spin-off games to each other on Slack (Taylordle being a personal favorite). We hosted rooftop socials where compers and execs alike posed alongside a projection of a Robert Pattinson fan edit on YouTube. We posed for each others’ BeReals at pitch meetings and production nights. We could go on, but to put it simply, it was beyond special to spend this year alongside you all. You made 14 Plympton St. home for us.
We would be lying if we said we didn’t tear up a little as we left Harvard after our last production night as Chairs this December. We both knew we’d be coming back to campus, but we knew we wouldn't be coming back to The Crimson, at least not in the way we did this year. (Though we will definitely visit!) We’ll have free time on Monday nights, and that will be a strange, bittersweet sort of freedom. We won’t have to run to the Quad shuttle at midnight after production night only for it to pull away as we arrive because neither of us pays close enough attention to the time. This is a long winded way of saying…we’ll miss you, Crimson Arts. We’re so thankful for you. And we’re so excited to see the work that Anya, Alisa, and the new masthead will do to make our content better and our community even stronger. We’ll be cheering you on ’til we graduate, and after that, too.
Okay, officially signing off now to go have a “Shrek” marathon and cry sentimental tears.
Artslove forever,
Jaden S. Thompson and Sofia Andrade
Arts Chairs of the 149th Guard of The Harvard Crimson

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Okay, it’s time to come clean: I think “Riverdale” is actually a brilliant show.
I won’t give my full manifesto on the absurdist genius of “Riverdale” here, but I will say this: their writers’ room has to be the most fun writers’ room in Hollywood. (There’s no way they’re not messing with everyone.... right?) From the demonic board games to secret half-siblings and illicit drugs with names like “jingle jangle” and “fizzle rocks,” “Riverdale” has a plethora of bonkers plotlines that I can’t help but be fascinated by. Although I haven’t actually watched a full episode since maybe 2018, I do watch the YouTube compilations of its greatest moments almost religiously, so I’ve learned a lot.
Here’s where that very useful knowledge has gotten me: Originally, I wanted to rank my favorite insane moments from the show, but that’s been done too many times already. So, instead, I thought I would help you figure out which bizarre plot you are based on your Zodiac sign (you’re welcome!)
Yes, these are all real things that happened on “Riverdale.” And yes, it has been on the air for six seasons now. Enjoy!
Aries: Archie Fights a Bear 
If any of these signs can take on a bear, it’s a ram. At one point during Season Three, leading man Archie Andrews (KJ Apa) has an unfortunate encounter with a grizzly bear in the Canadian wilderness. Why was Archie in the Canadian wilderness? I don’t really know, but I think it had something to do with escaping the law and his girlfriend’s evil father, Hiram Lodge (Mark Consuelos). Bold, ambitious, and a bit audacious, Aries are known to take risks, often diving headfirst into situations without thinking them through. Perhaps Archie should have come up with a more solid plan that didn’t involve staying in an isolated cabin in the woods (or at least brought bear spray), but that’s okay. Above all, Aries are courageous and fiery — that is, fearless enough to fight a bear and brag about it later (and they will brag about it later). And much like Archie, an Aries always bounces back: Archie was miraculously totally fine by the next episode (though he never missed an opportunity to show off his scars in his many, many shirtless scenes.)
Taurus: Veronica Opens a Speakeasy as a 17-Year-Old
Hard-headed and reliable, Tauruses love stability, comfort, and the finer things in life. They work hard and play hard — a fitting motto for La Bonne Nuit, the opulent speakeasy-slash-casino that Veronica (Camila Mendes) opened as a high schooler. Tauruses are ambitious, resilient, and endlessly stubborn when it comes to making their dreams come true: It’s this sort of willpower that allows Veronica to manage multiple business ventures, acquire several properties, and create a rum brand to rival her father’s all before taking the SAT. Furthermore, Taurses have a great affinity for the pleasures and indulgences of the material world. Their love of good food, drinks, and luxury goods would make any Taurus an incredible underaged proprietor of this lavish establishment.
Gemini: Betty’s Alleged Secret Half-Brother Commits Identity Fraud 
A quick disclaimer: I don’t want to contribute to old-fashioned Gemini slander (I promise, I’m actually a big fan of my fellow air signs!) — but this is such a ludicrous storyline that I couldn’t not include it. In Season Two, this random guy named Chic (Hart Denton) shows up at the Coopers’ house, claiming to be Alice’s (Mädchen Amick) firstborn child. As it turns out, Alice’s real biological son was not Chic, but Chic’s former lover Charles, who Chic was impersonating for some reason. Later on, Chic also takes on the mantle of the Gargoyle King, one of Season Three’s main antagonists (don’t ask). Needless to say, Chic is incredibly flexible, adaptable, and convincing, much like a Gemini. Geminis can strike up a conversation with anyone and fit in anywhere; as incredibly versatile and magnetic individuals, I don’t doubt that they could charm their way into a random family (or become a cult leader) like Chic.
Cancer: Cheryl Sends her Crush a Pig Heart
In Season Two, Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch) does a series of very creepy things to…. impress her classmate Josie (Ashleigh Murray). I don’t really get it, but she was truly playing the long game here: Cheryl sends Josie a series of threatening things including ransom notes and a pig heart, accuses another classmate of stalking Josie, then swoops in to provide Josie with emotional support while she’s scared for her safety. Genius! I’m not saying that Cancers would do such a thing, but Cancers will go to great lengths for their loved ones. These water signs are incredibly loyal and feel very deeply; however, they can also be prone to manipulative tendencies at times (hopefully nothing involving animal hearts). But they’re also incredibly heartfelt, like the portraits that Cheryl drew of herself and Josie. That’s kind of sweet, I guess?
Leo: All of the Musical Episodes
I’m not saying that all Leos are theater kids, but they’re probably not an underrepresented demographic in the thespian community. Luckily, “Riverdale” has plenty of musical episodes to choose from: Over the years, the show has done “Carrie,” “Heathers,” “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” and “Next to Normal.” The show’s attempts to connect the season’s ongoing storylines to the plots of these shows range from logical (the students stage a production of “Carrie” at school) to surreally bizarre (Betty’s mom creates an imaginary musical fantasy world to cope with reality). But “Riverdale” doesn’t need a reason for its theatrics, and neither do Leos. Spirited and vivacious, Leos are natural entertainers who live for the applause. With their affinity for glamor and flair for the dramatic, Leos embody “Riverdale” at its campiest.
Virgo: Jughead Has to Write Comic Books for All of Eternity to Keep Two Parallel Universes from Converging
This one requires a little bit of context that I don’t necessarily feel qualified to provide, but here goes: In Season Six, the characters are transported via an explosion or something to a darker, weirder version of their town called Rivervale, with a V, where ghosts, demons, and witches run amok. I quite literally don’t understand the rest of the season’s plot, but at one point, Jughead (Cole Sprouse) discovers that the only way to stop the two parallel universes from colliding is to become “a living battery and story generator that powers Rivervale by writing stories to fuel the universe so that it doesn't have to keep leeching off of Riverdale.” That’s a direct quote from the “Riverdale” Wiki. I don’t really know what that means, but I do know that it would take an inhuman amount of organization and discipline to stay focused while writing stories for all of eternity. Practical and systematic, there’s no one better for the job than a driven Virgo full of ideas. Virgos are logical, incredibly attentive to detail, and love to feel useful, but can be controlling when others’ performances aren’t on par with their own high standards (if only because they know they could do the job better). Who could be more qualified to oversee the future of the multiverse?
Libra: The Writing of the Show Itself
It’s no secret that Libras can be a little indecisive — and so can “Riverdale,” as it constantly waffles between genres and sometimes suddenly drops important plot points to make room for new storylines. Libras often have trouble making decisions, and can be prone to fantasy; they also have a natural inclination to see every side of a situation and are idealists at their core, though they can have trouble committing to one thing or another. For these reasons, I think there must be a strong Libra presence in the “Riverdale” writing room. Everything that could possibly happen on the show has happened, yet the writers always manage to do something new and unexpected. Why make choices when you can have it all?
Scorpio: Dark Betty
Scorpios are undoubtedly the mysterious cool kids of the zodiac. Charismatic yet private, Scorpios are an enigma to many — much like Betty’s (Lili Reinhart) alter ego, Dark Betty. It’s still unclear where this storyline came from or whether Dark Betty still exists, but these inconsistencies simply add to the mystery. Unable to express the darker parts of herself in her day-to-day life, Betty sometimes dresses in vastly different clothing, dons a black wig, and gives herself permission to behave badly (in one Dark Betty scene, she almost boils a classmate alive in a hot tub, in the name of feminism, of course). Later in the series, it’s revealed that the word “tangerine” is what triggers Betty’s darkness, so… do with that what you will? Scorpios are often drawn to darkness and intensity, using emotional energy as fuel. Similarly, Dark Betty is the manifestation of all of Betty’s darker emotions and impulses that lurk beneath the surface. Sorry Dark Betty, but Scorpios do it better — no costume wig needed.
Sagittarius: ‘The Epic Highs and Lows of High School Football’ 
In Season Three, Archie is in juvenile detention for some reason (again, I think it had to do with Veronica’s dad?). While trying to convince his fellow inmates to join his gang or play sports or something, he tells them that if they weren’t in juvie, they’d be in high school having a good time. One inmate disagrees: “Not me. I dropped out in the fourth grade to run drugs to support my Nana.” Archie’s response? “Then that means you haven’t known the triumphs and defeats, the epic highs and lows of high school football.” This line is undoubtedly one of the best in the entire series, and happens to reflect several Sagittarius traits. Charismatic, personable, and natural-born leaders, Sagittarians inspire those around them to live their best lives. Furthermore, they know how to rally a crowd (Archie successfully organizes a football game after this), love their freedom (he attempts to escape from juvie in the same episode), and are just really funny (so is this dialogue).
Capricorn: Betty Joins the FBI as a 17-Year-Old
Capricorns are the overachievers of the zodiac, and nothing says overachiever like the following storyline: In Season Four, Betty starts training with the FBI while still in high school, which is actually one of the more normal things to happen on this show. Her investigative prowess in exposing The Farm (an organ-harvesting cult that posed as an innocuous after-school club) scores her an invitation to the FBI Junior Trainee program (which is coincidentally run by Betty’s real half-brother, Charles). Betty truly excels in this program, quickly becoming the best in her class — similarly, Capricorns are widely known for their talent and competence (it’s later revealed that the real reason Betty is so good at identifying serial killers is that she has something called the “serial killer genes,” but that’s besides the point). Nevertheless, only a Capricorn’s admirable work ethic and clear sense of direction could land an internship like this.
Aquarius: ‘I’m Weird, I’m a Weirdo’
Jughead delivers this infamous speech in Season One, after his friends throw him a surprise party against his wishes. He confronts Betty, then insists that they are simply too incompatible and their relationship is doomed: Whereas Betty is the “perfect girl next door,” Jughead is weird. He’s a weirdo. He laments, “I’m weird. I’m a weirdo. I don’t fit in. And I don’t want to fit in. Have you ever seen me without this stupid hat [it’s a beanie] on? That’s weird.” As an Aquarius, I hate to admit that this is kind of an Aquarius thing to say. As the “eccentric professors” of the zodiac, Aquarians march to the beat of their own drum. Progressive and idealistic, they will always champion the underdog, though they sometimes come off as aloof or detached. Even if Aquarians don’t fit in and don’t want to fit in, they can sometimes cling a little too hard to the idea that they’re not like other girls. (It’s actually not even weird to wear a beanie).
Pisces: Everyone Has Superpowers Now
As the final sign of the zodiac, it’s said that Pisces have absorbed all the lessons learned by the other signs — as a result, they’re by far the most intuitive and empathetic. Pisces are sensitive, compassionate, and often considered to have some innate psychic abilities. Who else has psychic abilities? Many of the “Riverdale” characters, following an explosion in Season Six. Betty, for example, gains the ability to read others’ auras, while Jughead can read a person’s thoughts and memories. As it turns out, Cheryl is a pyrokinetic witch with the power of the Phoenix who later absorbs everyone else’s superpowers in order to save Riverdale from a comet, Scarlet Witch style (I can’t make this up). Pisces are also considered to be the artists of the zodiac, and there’s no denying that the Phoenix scene is pure art.

Have you already mastered charcuterie board making? Do you want to wow your friends and family this holiday season? Look no further. Here are eight must-haves that will bring your boards to the next level.
Ditch the Prosciutto, Embrace Serrano
There’s nothing wrong with some good ol’ prosciutto: Sometimes it just hits. But with its subtle, sweet flavor and a relatively moist texture, it won’t stand out on a board. So look for Jamón Serrano — prosciutto’s Spanish cousin. At the same price point, it offers a much more robust flavor, a harder texture, and a lively, bright red color to boot.
There’s More to It Than Pork: Bresaola
Pork’s incredibly versatile. But there’s much more variety to the world of cured meats than that. So beef up your board with bresaola, a traditional, thinly-sliced air-dried beef from Italy’s Valtellina region. Slightly sweet, and jam-packed with flavor, it can be tender and bright red or toothsome and almost purple depending on the length of aging. If you include this on your board, it is sure to be a visually-stunning crowd pleaser.
Sun-dried Tomatoes
Add some color and variety to your board with some healthy veg! Packed with flavor, sun-dried tomatoes will please even the staunchest hater of the stuff. Aromatic, chewy, simultaneously salty and slightly sweet, they will be gone in no time. One word of advice: If you don’t buy the ones in a jar, be sure to check the salt content — some might be almost unpalatably salty even after rehydrating and washing.
Rock with Roquefort
Blue cheese is sure going to stand out on a board, so don’t waste a chance to wow your guests. Gorgonzola is all right, but Roquefort — more moist, with a much more distinct, stronger, and yet less overpowering flavor — is where it’s at.
Venture Outside Cow’s Milk
Goat and sheep milk offer entirely different flavor profiles that carry onto the cheeses. The few daring souls who venture outside of cow’s milk still tend to stick to soft, creamy, white cheeses — think chèvre. Sure: These are intense in flavor, with a fresh, sharp profile, but the world of non-cow milk doesn’t end there. Give a hard or a semi-hard cheese a chance: Goat gouda offers much more complexity, with sweet and nutty notes. Spanish Manchego has a distinct, creamy, slightly piquant flavor with the trademark sheep milk aftertaste.
Feeling Bougie? Splurge for Jamón Ibérico de Bellota

Made from the meat of pure-bred Black Iberian pigs fed exclusively with acorns, Jamón Ibérico de Bellota is heaven on a plate. It’s intensely flavorful: rich, savory, and delightfully complex. Its extensive marbling literally melts on your tongue delivering all of the nuttiness courtesy of the pigs’ acorn diet. Don’t think twice: Splurge for Jamón Ibérico, let it get to room temperature, and enjoy.
Marinated Artichoke Hearts
On their own, artichokes can be a bit underwhelming. Cooked or fried, its mild flavor doesn’t stand out. But marinated? That’s a whole different story. Different brands are going to deliver different products, but they have one thing in common: Each brand brings out the acidity and the complex flavors of the ’choke. And there’s much more going for them than flavor, there’s also the texture: firm, ever so slightly chewy, and heterogeneous thanks to the remaining parts of leaves.
’Nough Said: ’Nduja
’Nduja, a Calabrian specialty, is like a mashup of Mexican and Spanish chorizo. A spreadable salami with a fiery red color and a flavor to match — courtesy of roasted chili peppers — it’s sure to liven up any bread or cracker.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although unsurprising to most, I’d call myself a “Hunger Games” expert. However, not in the way you may imagine. Most fans of the franchise preoccupy themselves with trivial Gale versus Peeta debates or fan edits from “Catching Fire.” I, however, hope to display my extensive knowledge on the most pivotal franchise known to modern society through a list. While it is a daunting task, I took it upon myself to craft together 10 of the biggest mistakes rookies would make in the Hunger Games.
10. Being Too Excited 
Stepping off the platform too early means certain death. Being blown up before the Games even start is sadder than being chosen to fight to the death amongst 23 other kids. At least give yourself a chance.
9. The Early Bird Does Not Catch the Worm 
This is for those who rush to the cornucopia immediately for a chance of a sliver of its treasures, including several crackers and empty bottles. How could someone see 23 other people storming towards the area holding the weapons — all with a high motive to kill you mercilessly — and say “Wait for me! I want in!” Not running as fast as you can in the other direction makes you the problem in this scenario.  
8. Staying Put 
If there isn’t a bigger sign to keep moving than tsunamis, murder monkeys, poisonous fog, and hallucination birds all in rotation on a timed clock system then maybe you should have convinced someone to volunteer in your place.
7. C.Y.T. (Check Your Tree) 
If you decide to seek refuge amongst the many trees in the arena, at least make sure there are not ravenous creatures lurking in the shadows. How Katniss slept all night unaware of a ginormous hive of vicious genetically-altered wasps right next to her head, I will never understand.
6. Don’t Sleep Stupidly, Sleep Smartly 
Even though Katniss slept next to lethal insects, those under the tree ended up dying once the hive landed on them. Again, there was no reason to sleep under that tree, the hive was very visible. Sleep wherever you so please, except in a location with a visible threat to your life.
5. Learn Anything 
You get several days to learn any sort of skill with any weapon with specialized trainers all to your disposal. Yet, nearly half of the tributes died missing an arrow shot or not being aware of how nets work. Learn something. Learn anything.
4. Not Being Peeta Mellark 
If Peeta Mellark taught us anything, it is the power of flight over fight. Know how to paint yourself like a rock and you will survive. (Having a highly trained archer tending to your wounds for half of the games also helps too).
3. Procrastination 
The smartest tribute in the 74th Games died by eating poisonous berries. While it’s seemingly hard to distinguish poisonous berries against normal ones, training involves learning different food sources and plant types. If you didn’t study for the fight of your life, that’s on you.
2. Thinking You Are the Girl on Fire 
A nice warm fire sounds amazing in the freezing cold of night, right? What does bright flames coupled with visible smoke not have in common with hiding from trained predators in the dark woods? Survival.
1. Not Staying Alive 
Haymitch tells Katniss to “Stay Alive” and she does. I would follow Haymich’s advice on this one.
—Incoming Comp Director and Film Executive Monique I. Vobecky can be found anxiously awaiting the release of the tickets for the fifth Hunger Games movie and debating that the last movies in the series, “Mockingjay” Parts 1 and 2, are not that bad. You can reach Monique at monique.vobecky@thecrimson.com or on twitter at @moniquevobecky to refute this opinion; however, only serious, evidence-based inquiries will be considered.

You can picture it. Or you can’t, if you’ve never been to the Boston Common AMC. But rest assured, Dear Reader, when I tell you that this megaplex movie theater is the closest thing you will find to heaven on the streets of Boston.
Quietly nestled on the side of quaint Tremont Street, the Boston Common AMC looms large in the canon of iconic Boston landmarks. Forget the Citgo Sign and the Old State House, those eyesores should have been torn down years ago: Everyone knows that the city’s real crown jewel is the Boston Common AMC. And don’t just take my word for it, because history has always been on its side. After seeing an early cut of “Avengers: Endgame” in the IMAX theater, George Washington turned to Abraham Lincoln and said, “Oh my God, that was the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. In fact, we ought to gain independence from Britain to truly honor this place.” You heard that right! The Boston Common AMC was single-handedly responsible for sparking the American Revolution.
Now, centuries later, the building is bigger and better than ever. For easy transportation to the theater, visitors can either take the Red Line to Park Street Station (which is its own feast for the eyes) or park in the nearby Ritz-Carlton garage for the shockingly low price of $100. Either way, prepare yourself to enter the building and be greeted by an open-concept lobby that looks like the inside of a beautiful Art Deco mansion. The customer service at this location is second to none, and the bored teenager scanning tickets in between TikToks will always look up from their phone long enough to lovingly say, “Theater Twelve.”
Now it’s time for the fun part: the escalator. Everyone knows that watching movies on street level is so pedestrian (and downright unsanitary!), so the Boston Common AMC plays almost all its movies on the second floor. Plus, if the escalator is broken for the day, you get a workout and a movie for one low price!
Once you arrive at the summit, you will find not just a concession stand but also MacGuffins Bar. No, you didn’t read that wrong: There is a full service bar inside this movie theater. Some prominent publications have deemed MacGuffins “Boston’s Greatest Bar You’ve Never Heard Of” simply because the atmosphere is always electric. Just the other week, I saw Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez getting a nightcap at MacGuffins. As for the concession stand, I hear the line moves reliably fast but I can’t personally comment due to my status as an AMC A-List Member. Along with many other benefits, I have access to a special concession line marked by a golden rope, so I always fly through the queue and revel in the envy of my non-A-List peers.
Once equipped with provisions, moviegoers can add butter to their popcorn and pour their soda before heading to the main event; don’t worry about how sticky the screen on the soda machine is, I promise it came like that. Luckily, there’s no such thing as a bad theater in the Boston Common AMC. In fact, each one has its own special amenity. Some of the theaters have seats with missing armrests which makes laying down a breeze, one has an entire row of seats that is coming unscrewed from the floor (extra reclining!), and another one is often hot enough to double as a sauna. So sit back, relax, and try not to worry about that creepy guy in the Patriots hoodie pulling an entire burrito out of his jacket pocket (that’s just me).
After your movie is over, try not to cry until you're outside the building. The AMC Boston Common has been on this earth for millenia, and it will always be there for you in your time of need. So wave goodbye to the friendly security guard, block your ears when you open the squeaky door to avoid hearing loss, and breathe the cold Boston air as a new person.
Okay, I have to go. “Avatar 2” is about to start and the usher is threatening to kick me out for typing so loudly. God, I love this place!
—Incoming Film Executive Brady M. Connolly is a card-holding AMC A-List Member who is getting tired of the Nicole Kidman advertisement that plays before every movie. Like, I’m already here! I know AMC makes movies better! Didn’t you read my vanity, Nicole?

Sitting here in Boston Logan Airport at 5:00 a.m., having been awake for more hours than I care to calculate, anxiously suppressing thoughts on the finals I have recently submitted, I am reminded that I am technically an adult now, who is legally allowed to be alone in an airport to travel home. And while I think about how ridiculous and inept and not-at-all like an adult I feel, I remember the cartoons that raised me.
Childrens’ cartoons, despite their name, hold an extremely important role in media for viewers of all ages. Most likely because of its target demographic, these cartoons are typically undervalued but they shouldn’t be. Though not all works that compose this demographic are like the brilliant and challenging cartoons I want to draw attention to, the same can be said of every genre of every medium in existence. And through a few examples, I think it’s clear how special children’s media can be.
To begin with, children’s shows demonstrably do not stay away from dark subject matter — “Avatar: The Last Airbender” and Italian cartoon “Winx Club” both begin with the genocide of the protagonist’s home people (if I had a nickel…). “Avatar: The Last Airbender”’s cultural capital is now widely undisputed, and I would not hesitate to call it one of the best animations of all time. Its wonderful cast of characters (the only things stopping me from writing a think piece on each and every character are my psets) are all treated with grace and nuance, and its depiction of the harm of colonialism and the trauma of war is so impactful.
Not only that, but desperately trying to figure out the weird airing schedule Nickelodeon was using to try to watch “Legend of Korra,” “Avatar”’s sequel, is a core memory. Korra is a unique protagonist, and her journey from an arrogant, stubborn, short-sighted teenager to a mature, selfless, and compassionate leader is nothing short of breathtaking — and Book 3 remains to this day one of the most tightly plotted, tension-filled seasons of television I have ever seen.
In a slightly different vein, “Steven Universe” is a wonderfully sweet and funny cartoon about family and togetherness, but it’s also incredibly clever — few shows, films or books that I have consumed since come close to the breadth and depth of foreshadowing going on in those lighthearted ten minute episodes that are seemingly filler.
Similarly, “She-Ra: Princesses of Power” begins as a whimsical romp filled with colorful characters who have sparkly powers, but quickly becomes a treatise on responsibility, heroism, colonial exploitation, and healing from abuse. It’s gorgeous and heartfelt, and I only find more things to appreciate about it every time I watch it.
These shows, and many more I don’t have time to delve into, are inextricably tied to memories of childhood, but they hold a power beyond nostalgia. The only things that are truly off-limits in a children’s medium are bad language, sex, and gore, which really means that what is taken away is spectacle — these properties have the opportunity to tell complex, genuine, thought-provoking stories by starting at the very simplest level. They frequently center the joy and hope we want to instill within the next generation, even in the context of dark stories, and the very best even do so without talking down to the audience.
I don’t see how we can ask for much more from our art. And I desperately hope my episodes of “Spongebob” finish downloading before they call my flight.

— Outgoing Columns Exec and incoming TV Exec Millie Mae Healy has too many opinions about children's cartoons (and just art in general) and always welcomes hot takes, dissenting views, or just being told that she’s right at milliemae.healy@thecrimson.com.

As I loaded up my Apple Music Replay on Dec. 2, 2020 I was prepared to face a round of annual harassment as a proud defender of Apple Music amid a sea of Spotify Wrapped posts. But, as I scrolled through my top songs and artists I quickly realized there was a much larger embarrassment looming in my near future. To my shock, the “Julie and The Phantoms” soundtrack had climbed its way to number one on my most played albums list.
For the unenlightened, “Julie and the Phantoms” is a hit Netflix children's series released in Sept. 2020. The show follows 15-year-old Julie Molina (Madison Reyes) as she rediscovers her love of music following the death of her mom a year prior to the show's start. On her journey she’s accompanied by Luke (Charlie Gillespie), Alex (Owen Patrick Joyner), and Reggie (Jeremy Shada), a trio of ghost musicians who formerly made up the band Sunset Curve before their own tragic deaths. The big catch of the show is that no one but Julie can see the three ghosts except for when they play music with her. This leads them to form a “hologram band” that serves as the show's core as they take on the challenges of high school love triangles and evil ghostly enemies.
After accepting my fate as a certified #fantom (no, I’m not making that up), I spread the wondrous word of JATP to anyone and everyone who would listen. I recruited my sister, my mom, friends, acquaintances, anyone who would give a mere 4.5 hours of their time to watch what is unequivocally the best show in children’s television. Do I know any actual children who have watched it? No, of course not. But an army of young women on TikTok won the show an MTV Movie + TV Award, which has to count for something.
Why do I love a children’s TV show on Netflix enough to have played the soundtrack 90 times between September and December of 2020? It’s hard to say exactly. Perhaps it's because the fictional pop-punk boy band — Sunset Curve — is a clear knock off of 2015 era 5 Seconds of Summer. Or maybe, it’s because I grew up watching “High School Musical” on repeat, which hardwired my brain to enjoy anything put out by Kenny Ortega. Most likely, it’s the fact that the music of “Julie and the Phantoms” is just unironically good.
From Sunset Curve’s opening performance of the grungy “Now or Never,” to the final notes of “Stand Tall” in the season one finale, the music of “Julie and the Phantoms” both propels the story forward and shows off the immense talent of the cast. Just 15 years old while making the show, Reyes is a true star in the making and a vocal powerhouse, as heard on Julie’s solo power ballad “Wake Up.” She splits vocals with the guitar-playing ghost and main love interest, Luke, on songs like “Edge of Great” — the uncontested stand out from the show. Luke also has his solo moment to shine on the heart-wrenching “Unsaid Emily,” in a scene that I’ll admit I’ve cried while watching on more than one occasion.
JATP had everything going for it: high viewership, a rabid fanbase, and a team of actors and crew members who were genuinely invested in the project. There was even talk about a Julie and the Phantoms tour featuring the main cast. Yet, after a year of waiting for the show's renewal, Netflix announced its cancellation in December of 2021. With the announcement, what was once a shining light in the darkness of the COVID-19 pandemic became a mere memory tinged with the haunting reality of unanswered questions and wonders of what could have been. Nevertheless, “Julie and the Phantoms” is a truly wonderful show and I will continue to coerce all of my friends into watching it as I humbly beg the Netflix gods for its revival. Afterall, if Luke, Reggie, and Alex can come back from the dead, so can the “Julie and the Phantoms.”

— Incoming Co-Music Exec Jen A. Hughes is seeking a formal apology for the cancellation of “Julie and the Phantoms.” If you or anyone you know works for Netflix, all apologies can be sent to jen.hughes@thecrimson.com and must include clarity on what the hell the Season One cliffhanger was supposed to mean. Those now living in fear for the future of The Crimson’s music section can rest assured knowing that the Arts Chairs are actively searching for my replacement after reading this confession.

In just a few short weeks, I’ll be leaving my beloved Crimson Arts friends and 14 Plympton Street behind in exchange for a semester studying abroad in Spain. As excited as I am to be in Madrid for five whole months, I am also incredibly sad to be far away from the place and people I called home every Monday night for close to four years now. I am not sure what I will do with myself with this newfound free time and access to international high-speed trains. Luckily, there is a fellow ex-pat currently having her moment in the cultural spotlight from whom I can learn: Emily from “Emily in Paris,” which just had its Season Three premiere on Dec. 21.
Of course, Emily and I thankfully have our differences. While Emily is in Paris indefinitely after quitting her corporate America job (#girlboss), I will only be in Madrid for a few months. I speak the language in Spain, whereas Emily has somehow lived in France for an extended period of time without learning anything outside of her elementary French class. I’d also hope we approach our interpersonal relationships differently, especially given Emily’s flair for drama throughout all three seasons of “Emily in Paris.”
Perhaps the most important thing that sets Emily and I apart, though, is the fact that I, on my student worker budget, do not have tens of thousands of dollars to spend on (questionable. over-the-top) designer clothing. But that doesn’t mean I can’t dream! So, here are some of the outfits from the third season of “Emily in Paris” and the study abroad scenario in which I’d wear them.
This Pink Feather Moment
Emily wears this dramatic, custom-made Marylin Fitoussi feather coat while on her way to say goodbye to her on-and-off boyfriend Alfie at his going away party. She pairs it with an equally colorful Magda Butrym dress and some trendy platform heels in a cool mint color. While Emily wears this to see someone off to the airport, I would go one step further and change into this outfit the second I step off my plane at Aeropuerto Madrid-Barajas. Going abroad is all about making an entrance, which is exactly what I’d be doing as I struggle to lug all of my belongings to the train station without getting myself tangled in all the feathers.
This Green Miu Miu Coat
Emily wears this psychedelic, neon green Miu Miu trench from the Summer 2015 collection while out on the town, pairing it with a chic updo and neon green handbag. I, too, would wear it while out and about in the city for safety reasons: the coat’s vibrant color will ensure I’m visible to nearby motorists. Further, I’ll arrive in Madrid in the dead of winter, and this coat will definitely keep me warm as I walk from my apartment to the bus stop.
This Dolce & Gabbana Zebra-Print Jacket 
Sure, this top might be among Emily’s more exclusive pieces — it comes right off the Dolce & Gabbana Spring 2022 ready-to-wear runway — but that does not make it a more desirable piece, per se. It seems extremely inconvenient for bustling city life (hello, those arm fins!) and is also just… a lot. Nevertheless, I am adaptable and resourceful. I would wear this piece to a music festival or general admission concert for the very simple and practical reason that its sheer wingspan would protect my personal space in a sea of fellow attendees.
This Light Blue Polka-Dot Dress
Emily dons this summery cut-out dress while weekending in Provence with British beau Alfie. Ever the designer aficionado, she pairs it with a scarf from the late, great Vivienne Westwood tied around her woven bag. Provence is a bit further away from my Spanish homebase (though that doesn’t mean I won’t make it there!), so I’d wear this look on my daily walks along el Parque del Retiro. I can picture it: a coffee in hand, an afternoon siesta in my future, and the most beautiful day for strolling around and not sabotaging my close friend’s long-term relationship à la Emily.
This Orange and Teal Combo
This look is one of Emily’s more affordable moments. She wears this orange Iris Apfel x H&M tunic dress and metallic teal Maison Skorpios boots while enjoying her short-lived period of “funemployment” midway through the season. Though an attempt to avoid fast fashion means I wouldn’t go out of my way to buy that H&M dress, I, like Emily, will likely be funemployed while abroad. On the one hand, I look forward to experiencing life without a 5-to-9 after the 9-to-5 that is university. This outfit will ensure I’m colorful and ready to seize the day. On the other hand, I might take another page from Emily’s book and work a stint in a restaurant or coffee shop somewhere. Ahí veremos.
—Outgoing Arts Chair Sofia Andrade will miss the Crimson Arts board dearly while abroad. She also welcomes any and all recommendations for the ideal Spanish lifestyle, including where to find the best secondhand clothing, at sofia.andrade@thecrimson.com. If you would like to donate your own designer items to the cause, you can DM her on Twitter at @bySofiaAndrade.

Since its release on Nov. 30, ChatGPT has had many talking about the future of artificial intelligence and whether it has the potential to make entire job markets — in software development, copywriting, customer service, and more — go extinct. ChatGPT is a language model created by OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company, that answers questions and executes written tasks from users in a conversational way. ChatGPT can write essays, computer programs, research proposals, legal contracts, cover letters, and more, but can it write Arts reviews at the same level of our beloved Arts writers at The Crimson? I asked ChatGPT to write reviews of some of the most popular art (Film, Music, TV, Books, and Theatre) The Crimson Arts has reviewed in the past. Here’s what it responded:
User: “Write a short review of Pixar’s ‘Soul.’”
ChatGPT: “‘Soul’ is a beautifully crafted and emotionally powerful film from Pixar that explores the meaning of life. The animation is stunning, and the film touches on deep themes about finding and pursuing passions, relationships, and self-discovery. The voice acting is superb, and the score is excellent. Overall, it's a must-see for fans of Pixar and anyone looking for a heartwarming and meaningful cinematic experience.”
Read our original review of “Soul” here.
User: “Write a short review of the album ‘Positions’ by Ariana Grande.”
ChatGPT: “Ariana Grande's album ‘Positions’ is a diverse showcase of her vocal range and artistic growth, featuring a range of genres from pop and R&B to hip hop and Latin music. The lyrics are introspective and personal, tackling themes of love, heartbreak, and self-discovery with honesty and vulnerability. The production is top-notch, with a mix of live instruments and electronic beats giving each track a unique sound and vibe. It's a must-listen for fans of pop and R&B music.”
Read our original review of “Positions” here.
User: “Write a short review of the TV Series ‘Tiger King.’”
ChatGPT: “‘Tiger King’ is a wild and bizarre true crime documentary series that follows the life of eccentric big cat enthusiast Joe Exotic and his tumultuous relationship with animal rights activist Carole Baskin. The series is filled with outrageous and unbelievable moments, including polygamous marriages, drug use, and even allegations of murder. It's a must-watch for fans of true crime documentaries and anyone looking for a wild and unpredictable viewing experience, just be prepared for some truly shocking and unsettling moments.”
Read our original review of “Tiger King” here.
User: “Write a short review of ‘A Promised Land’ by Barack Obama.”
ChatGPT: “‘A Promised Land’ is the highly anticipated memoir from former President Barack Obama and is a deeply personal and candid reflection on his life and political career, covering everything from his childhood and early career to his time in the White House. Obama writes with honesty and vulnerability, conveying the immense weight and responsibility that comes with being the leader of the free world, and offers insight into one of the most significant presidencies in recent history. It's a must-read for anyone interested in politics, history, or simply wanting to get to know Barack Obama on a deeper level.”
Read our original review of “A Promised Land” here.
User: “Write a short review of the musical ‘Hamilton.’”
ChatGPT: “‘Hamilton’ is a groundbreaking musical that tells the story of Alexander Hamilton through a mix of hip hop, R&B, and traditional showtunes. The score is infectious and catchy, and the cast is top-notch, with brilliant performances by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Daveed Diggs, and Renée Elise Goldsberry. The staging and set design are also impressive, with clever and creative use of projections and multimedia elements. It's a must-see for fans of musical theater and anyone looking for a fresh and innovative take on historical events.”
Read our five year retrospective of “Hamilton” here.
At first glance, the responses from ChatGPT are stunning. The model has an amazing breadth of knowledge about different art forms, and it can convincingly describe them in prose. However, if one were to compare these responses to those of our Crimson Arts writers (linked above), the limitations of using ChatGPT to review art would become glaringly obvious.
If I didn’t know any better, I would think that every piece of art ever is a “must-see, must-listen, must-watch, or must-read.” In fact, ChatGPT’s reviews entirely lack any sort of negative criticism. While I don’t doubt the excellence of the selected works of art, I’m always a bit skeptical of glowing reviews with zero critiques. ChatGPT’s reviews are also surface level, dare I say soulless, in comparison to our Arts writers’. That is, Arts Staff Writers have personal experiences that allow them to contextualize art and analyze it more critically than an artificial intelligence language model, which is simply fed information from external sources — not to mention the fact that ChatGPT is only trained on data through 2021.
At this point, I believe ChatGPT could be a fantastic tool for wireframing a rough draft of articles for The Crimson Arts, but it is far from producing a compelling and polished review by our standards. And our Arts Writers? I think they’ll be just fine for the foreseeable future.
—Outgoing Editor-at-Large and former Culture Executive Chibuike K. Uwakwe ’23 wishes ChatGPT was available to help edit Arts pieces before the end of his tenure at The Crimson

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A possibly unknown fact about me is that I’m bad at staying on task. This is mostly due to one phenomenon: that the Internet is a vast, endlessly searchable sea, and I am but a simple sponge carried along its currents. But as much as I would like to live by following my online whims, preferably while eating peach slices out of a dish and learning that I’ve inherited a ludicrous sum of money from a previously unknown relative, I’m regrettably subject to the efficiency-driven hellscape that defines modern society and the #grindset that plagues the Harvard student body.
So in January, I took the plunge and installed a site-blocking extension to make all those distracting little sites inaccessible to me. However, cutting myself off from one distraction almost always just leads to me finding another one. After a year, I’ve amassed quite the list of time-wasting sinkholes, from the general to the embarrassingly niche, that I will never allow my browser to navigate to again. Here are the top five websites I’ve had to block this year to save my productivity.
1. YouTube
We’ll begin with the obvious. 93% of Gen Z adults use YouTube, and for six days of the week, I am now part of that other 7%. And believe it or not, when I’m not watching four-hour video essays on financially and ethically dubious theme parks, I actually get more done.
2. Letterboxd
Film review site Letterboxd is not just for film bros and one-sentence comedians — it’s also for me, when I need to spend two hours agonizing over whether “Bodies Bodies Bodies” deserves three or three-and-a-half stars. I would justify this as helping me practice the skill of media criticism and defense of my opinions, except for the fact that this would be a big lie. After Letterboxd became the first suggestion when I typed the letter L into the search bar, onto the blocklist it went.
3. WeHeartIt
A shameless ripoff of Pinterest and a hub for rampant art theft, WeHeartIt is a home for everyone who wants an aesthetic Instagram feed without actually having to take pictures themselves. Don’t be fooled by its relative obscurity — this website is like crack. The hypnotic charm of sorting images into niche collections — one for photos with Victorian gothic vibes, another for anything that reminded me of “Euphoria” — can be irresistible, luring you into a calming sense of relaxation. It’s like tending a garden. Except the garden is your WeHeartIt collection, and the flowers are little square boxes on a screen.
4. Receiptify & Spotify Pie
Perhaps the most baffling entry on my blocklist, Receiptify — the evil-genius creation of Carnegie Mellon student Michelle Liu — generates a “receipt” of a Spotify user’s most-played songs each month. Why subject yourself to the horrifying panopticon of Spotify Wrapped when you could instead obsessively track your own listening data in real time? My Receiptify use got to the point where I was checking my silly little music receipt daily, following what changes each day of listening brought and cheering on my favorite songs like sports teams when they moved up a rank.
Also deserving of a shoutout (and a hard block during working hours) is Darren Huang’s Spotify Pie, from which I learned that I was listening to music genres I never knew existed. I’d like to thank Darren for giving me the vocabulary to now call myself an anti-folk etherpop indie poptimism girlie.
5. LinkedIn
Unilaterally the worst of all social media platforms, LinkedIn is nonetheless the website I turned to after eliminating each of my better options one by one. Despite the site being actively hostile to human life, I found myself mindlessly scrolling through post after post of internship announcements and accepting requests from anyone who seemed remotely nice. Is this a cancellable offense? Perhaps. But I own it with pride and joy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Widener was the first Harvard library that I ever set foot in. After spending an hour in the reading room, I quickly realized that all possible noise was sanitized. Every backpack wasn’t unzipped, but rather slowly peeled open — zipper tooth by zipper tooth — so as to not disturb the stagnant air. Every sticker-covered hydro flask was carefully, robotically placed on the hundred-year-old tables to prevent any sound waves from escaping. Every breath was taken with altered diaphragm movements to prevent a cough or, god forbid, an echoing sneeze. Okay, I’m being dramatic. But places like Widener have an impenetrable silence that can almost be distracting at times.
Luckily, there’s the Smith Campus Center. I love Smith. There’s the 10th floor with a stunning view, every shape and color of chair imaginable, and this background soundtrack of Lo-fi music to keep you awake as you finish out that last problem set.
Throughout my freshman year, the music was Lo-fi. Flash forward to the fall of this year, and everything has changed. I can picture it: I’m not in desperate need of Widener's iron silence to finish any papers or study for a final, so I take the elevator to Smith's 10th floor and begin to study. At first, I’m too distracted by the view of the Charles River to anticipate anything but the usual, expected Lo-fi playlist. But then, as I’m starting that first “piggybacking off of…” comment on a class blog post, I’m hit by this emotional d[e][é]ja vu. I’m 7. I’m eating goldfish and drinking a Capri Sun as I stare at the TV, watching a red-haired mermaid swim through the ocean with a yellow fish, singing “what’s a fire, and why does it burnnnnnn.” But I’m not 7. I’m not watching “The Little Mermaid.” I’m trying to figure out how to use an APA citation for my Expos draft that’s due tonight.
That was the fateful day that I discovered that the music of Smith Campus Center changed from harmless, background Lo-fi to acoustic reincarnations of every Disney soundtrack known to humankind. There has been some new bravery and audacity in whoever chooses the music that hundreds of students will listen to from 9:00 A.M. opening to 10:00 P.M. closing.
And honestly, when it’s a Friday and you haven’t started that Stat 110 problem set due in a few hours, reliving Aladdin’s “A Whole New World” played on a Yamaha might just be the very thing that you need. So in that sense, this vanity isn’t really a critique, but more of a question: Why, Smith?
As much as a study space is made of comfortable chairs and convenient outlet stations, music is such an important part of creating a space. And if Smith Campus Center saw this review, they might just say, “Let It Go,” you “Poor Unfortunate Souls.” Or they might say, “You’ve got a friend in me” and I’ll give you “The Bare Necessities” by letting Harvard students have some say in the music that is played throughout study spaces.
Anyway, next time that you enter Smith Campus Center, this is your friendly reminder (warning?) that you may be entering “Into the [Musically] Unknown.”
