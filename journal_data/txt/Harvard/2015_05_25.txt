After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
POINT: Alan R. Xie, 3 Stars
Based on a true story, “Marguerite & Julien” depicts the romance between a brother (Jérémie Elkaïm) and sister (Anaïs Demoustier). The children of the Lord of Tourlaville, Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet have a close and loving relationship while growing up that eventually blossoms into something more in adulthood. The forbidden nature of their incest is the crux of conflict in the film, as their family seeks to conceal it by marrying Marguerite to another man (Géraldine Chaplin).
The film is unnecessarily melodramatic and overdone, with much of its almost two-hour runtime filled with suggestive scenes between the two siblings prior to the consummation of their relationship. Although Demoustier exudes in her performance an unyielding and passionate devotion to the illicit romance, Elkaïm’s acting is more stiff and unconvincing. The two leads certainly do not make the film worthy of its excessive drama—in fact, another similar film in competition this year at Cannes, Maïwenn’s “Mon roi,” is a far superior French romance.
Admittedly, the film’s cinematography and aesthetics are impressive. Donzelli employs a unique technique where she establishes a seemingly still shot with all of the characters motionless that suddenly bursts into motion as the camera slowly rotates into place. She approaches costumes and other visuals with a flair that sometimes is reminiscent of Wes Anderson, but the deliberate inclusion of anachronistic objects such as helicopters and automobiles is ultimately too disorienting. Perhaps this story functions better as a fairy tale—within the film’s frame narrative, it’s actually presented as such to a group of young girls—but at face value, it is a far from compelling love story.
COUNTERPOINT: Tianxing V. Lan, 5 Stars
“Marguerite & Julien” does only one thing: It tells a simple but beautiful love story. Director Valérie Donzelli does not bother to discuss incest as an ethical problem, and the title characters seem to be fine with the fact that they are siblings. However, the film accomplishes its goal to an extreme, both in regard to the burning passion on screen and the strikingly stylized visuals. The result is a riveting tale full of destructive love and moving sense of destiny.
Most noticeable in the film is the director’s stylistic take on this 400-year old story. Some important scenes start with a still shot where the camera floats around the characters, some are accompanied by pop songs with English lyrics, and oftentimes people use cameras, flashlights, or even helicopters with no explanation. These anachronisms give the film a wonderful reminiscence of deconstructionist visual arts, implicative of the modern viewpoint in the narrative as if the characters know they are only recreating the history, but not living in it. Thus even when the film cuts back to perfectly normal 17h century scenes, the audience is still alerted that what the actors wear are costumes, and the castles are sets.
This is very similar to Baz Luhrmann’s “Romeo + Juliet,” another attempt to tell a classic story in a modern narrative. The unique style not only makes the film more visually fascinating, but also reminds the audiences that what they see is a story staged by a director and a cast, and as such the plausibility of the plot is not the priority, because its function is to create the emotions between the characters. Donzelli does not spend much time on exposition, but focuses heavily on the love between the two, and the rage of the society, which serves to accentuate their love by contrast. For instance, the director does not explain why the police force of a whole country seems to be involved in the search for the siblings, and the helicopters they use evidently do not belong to their age. But when the audience already accepts that “making sense” is not a concern of the movie, it might appreciate the sharp contrast between the power of the society and the helplessness of Marguerite and Julien as a visual representation of the “us against the world” sentiment.
The visual style is just one of the many ways the director lets the passion of the couple burn out. The actors’ theatrical lines magnify the expression of emotions, and the grand baroque music put side by side with modern love songs (another thing that does not “make sense” but does suit the emotions) beautifully speak out their love, their desire, their fears and their resolution. At last, the sense of foreboding throughout the film resonates with the destructive nature of romantic love. From the beginning, the audience knows the characters would be parted and punished, but then the process leading towards it is still heartbreaking. At the final scene when the inevitable fate finally befalls onto the banished couple, they feel like the ancestors of La nouvelle Héloïse, Werther, Hermann and Dorothea.
Admittedly, “Marguerite & Julien” is extravagant and very dramatic, but these are not necessarily bad things. In this film, these are exactly what is beautiful about this modernist, theatrical and captivating film.

People with a short attention span should think twice before watching “Nie Yinniang” (“The Assassin”), because it features extremely slow pacing and a large number of empty shots. If the viewer is prepared for slowness, however, he or she may discover the many beautiful surprises from the new work of Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien, regardless of whether they end up loving the film or not.
Hou Hsiao-Hsien is best known for his period films and stories of city life. A master of slow long shots and depictions of subtle emotions, he surprised his fans seven years ago when he started a wuxia project, as the wuxia genre mainly deals with the fights of ancient Chinese Kung Fu masters. As it turns out, though, the movie goes beyond previous films in Hou’s arthouse style. Most of the film is devoted to an understated study of the protagonist’s psychological struggle.
Nie Yinniang (Shu Qi), a character in a ninth century folk tale, is the cousin of Tian Jian (Chang Chen), ruler of the Weibo province. However, she has been kidnapped and trained to be a lethal assassin, helping the central government clear out the disobedient provincial governors. When she is ordered to assassinate her cousin Tian, she has to choose whether she should listen to her emotions or abandon them as her work demands.
The director tries to have as little dialogue as possible (the leading actress, Shu, has perhaps fewer than ten lines), instead expressing the mood with cinematography and pacing. Many shots carry the hesitation and contemplation of the characters while still long shots suggest Nie Yinniang’s gaze at the world around her. In a beautiful shot in the later part of the movie, she brews an herbal medicine for her injured father (Dahong Ni), who is also a general in the Weibo province, and her father looks at her from behind. Yinniang’s action is an expression of her emotion, and this sequence demonstrates how she becomes aware of this emotion. The still long shot exposes her hesitative examination of whether she should give it up, and her father, knowing already she plans to assassinate the governor, looks at his daughter in a new way. All these things transpire without a word.
However, in some other shots where there does not seem to be any emotion or psychological struggles taking place, the director nevertheless spends extensive time shooting people passing by, horses eating grass, or characters speaking extremely slowly. The indiscriminate deliberateness is often confusing, and in exposition scenes that only serve to provide background information, the pacing becomes annoying—even the title of the film rolls for nearly a minute. If the director had kept the long shots that are full of emotional tension and then chosen a normal pace for the rest of the film, it might have been a lot more interesting.
While this pacing throughout the film might be at points ill-considered, the bottom line is that the cinematography is breathtaking. Many shots resemble traditional Chinese shan shui painting and evoke an atmosphere similar to the poems of the Tang Dynasty, during whose reign the story is set. From lakes and mountains surrounded by fog to interior scenes shot looking through a shelf of candles, all the objects in the movie have a serene and elegant beauty. The action scenes are delicate but sporadic, often starting and ending suddenly.
“Nie Yinniang” is an elegant wuxia movie, so beautifully shot that the cinematography alone could make it a masterpiece. However, at times it also can be confusingly slow and hard to relate to, which is the biggest problem—and probably the only problem—with the film.

One of the more explicit films at the Cannes Film Festival this year outside of Gaspar Noé’s “Love,” “The Other Side” opens with a full-frontal shot of a naked man, passed out on the side of the road. It is a relatively normal scene for the documentary, which focuses on the citizens of a rural Louisiana town and features rampant nudity, sex, and drug use.Italian-born director and co-writer Roberto Minervini—who recently completed a trilogy of films about the state of Texas—zeroes in on a marginalized community to present an unadulterated and poetically tragic portrait of small-town America.
It’s a community filled with people like Mark (Mark Kelley) and Lisa (Lisa Allen), who spend much of their time drinking, smoking weed, or using methamphetamine. When Mark is not doing meth, he is cooking small amounts of it in a dark, cramped trailer—a more depressingly realistic portrayal compared to “Breaking Bad”—and dealing it to everyone from his sister to a pregnant woman. Along these lines, the film has a lot of potential walk-out triggering moments: Mark helping Lisa shoot up using veins on her breasts, Christmas dinners dominated by criticism of President Obama and liberal use of the N-word, and even the aforementioned pregnant woman doing meth before doing her shift at a strip club.
Minervini portrays this squalor from a cool, detached perspective—even when Mark criticizes Obama’s economic policies or a toothless veteran rambles on about Hillary Clinton, Minervini seems to refrain from passing judgment. If anything, he aims to highlight the unseen tragedy behind the town’s unabashed hedonism, in moments such as one when Mark and Lisa contemplate voluntarily going to jail for three months to kick their drug dependency. Although their characters are distinctly unlikeable, their raw and convincing vulnerability evokes empathy. Between the film’s quintessentially American wet T-shirt contests or discussions of Second Amendment rights, there exists a desolate group of people with no real place in society. Even when the film focuses on a tight-knit militaristic group of Libertarians, Minervini shows the bitter irony of their existence—until the collapse of society into total anarchy, they will be forever irrelevant and relegated to the fringe. Yet once one moves past the shock value of the film’s brutally honest portrayals of debauchery, it is still a rare glimpse at a part of society most will never see.

“Love” is not a film that can be calmly discussed. It is full of crazily stylistic shots, blinding psychedelic lights and sets, non-chronological narratives, electronic music mixed with post-rock and Erik Satie, and, above all, almost one hour of hardcore sex scenes. It has the equal potential to be a masterpiece or to be a hideous, narcissistic attempt to draw attention; as it turns out, it is a mixture of both.
It would be a huge mistake if the viewer were lured by the title into believing that it is a warm uplifting comedy suitable for a family movie night with grandma. The movie starts with a long shot of a handjob in slow motion, and the intensely graphic does not stop there. Director Gasper Noe explores almost all possibilities for intercourse, from couples to threesomes to orgies. To distinguish the film from pornography, all these scenes are shot in a strikingly artistic and madly stylized way. In one sex scene, the scarlet bed is lit by a red neon-like light, the naked bodies are as solemn as Greek sculptures, and the rest of the room, covered in shadow, looks like a Renaissance oil painting. There are numerous shots that are impressively daring and attractively taboo, among which is a closeup of a penis ejacuating towards the camera, in addition to a scene of penetration shot from the inside of a vagina—all the more striking since the film is shot in 3D. Compared to “Love,” even Lars Van Trier’s “Nymphomaniac” looks like a romantic comedy.
The visual experimentation of “Love” is not limited to its sex scenes. For much of the movie, the camera follows the protagonist from behind and smoothly accompanies him through hallways and into different rooms, creating a mesmerizing sense of movement. When the narrative cuts back and forth between the past and the present, the composition often remain the same, with the protagonist at the same position in the frame. Many still shots suddenly cut to black and immediately cut back, and the result is very similar to Barnett Newman’s paintings, in which a vast area of one color is interrupted by a strip of another color.
The story of “Love,” although told in non-chronological fragments, is rather simple and creates the film’s biggest problem. Murphy (Karl Glusman) is an American in Paris, and he falls crazily in love with Electra (Aomi Muyock). They experiment with sex and drugs, but Murphy’s fidelity eventually makes Electra leave him. The film follows Murphy’s thoughts when the relationship is over and traces back through time as he remembers everything that occurred between him and Electra while blaming himself for his stupid actions. In the first hour, the story unfolds quite nicely, but in the subsequent hour and a half, it just keeps repeating itself in an awfully boring and self-assured way, as the two keep breaking up, getting mad at each other, getting back together, having crazy sex, and breaking up again. The didactic and self-serving lines about the sentiments of sex and meaning of life just make it worse, and, when the two protagonists spend the last thirty minutes screaming at each other almost non-stop, all the beautiful visuals cannot save the film from being dull.
“Love” is an intensely well-crafted work of visual art put together with a boring, repetitive story. While director Gasper Noe creates brilliant shots, he lacks the fundamental craft of storytelling, which undermines an otherwise wonderful movie.

A slow-paced, realist drama about one man’s personal struggles, Michel Franco’s “Chronic” is at first glance reminiscent of a fellow film in competition at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, “La loi du marché” (“The Measure of a Man”). But whereas that film’s portrayal of a man in financial crisis readily translates into a broader, allegorical critique of Europe’s economic woes, “Chronic” is an intimate, focused film content to merely explore in depth one man’s process of grief.
The film is propelled by a nuanced and delicate performance from lead actor Tim Roth (“Reservoir Dogs”), who fills every shot with a silent but powerful sense of profound melancholy. His character, David, is a nurse who cares for terminally ill patients, and much of the film passes in contemplative silence—Franco is content to fill the screen with long, almost torturous shots of David cleaning and bathing his patients. It is captivating to watch Roth in this role, as his character demonstrates unwavering patience and tenderness throughout the film—displayed, for example, one scene in which he cleans excrement off of a patient’s buttocks.
The actors who play Roth’s three patients in the film—who also correspond to each of the story’s three acts—deserve accolades as well. From Sarah (Rachel Pickup) to John (Michael Cristofer) to Martha (Robin Bartlett), each conveys a tragic sense of fragility and vulnerability, especially through the intense physicality of their acting. The script, also penned by Franco, is well-structured—the passing of each of David’s patients represents a figurative passing for David through his grief over a past personal tragedy. Franco gradually reveals the details of this event, which is only hinted at through David’s obsessive and almost pathological dependency on the patients he cares for. He stays extra overnight shifts and brings them presents on birthdays—but it’s clear that David’s need to connect with his patients is a projection of his own emotions. When Sarah passes, he tells a couple at a bar that his wife has just died of AIDS; when the bed-ridden John mentions his former career as an architect, David poses as one at a bookstore and purchases his patient reading material on the subject.

The film’s lack of score further accentuates the sensitive, dialogue-less moments shared between David and his patients. Although he is more awkward and reserved in his interactions with other people—including his ex-wife and daughter—he seems only able to find emotional catharsis through his patients. Multiple scenes show David running in place on a treadmill, a metaphorical representation of how grief has rendered his life emotionally stagnant. Franco suggests a departure from this static existence in the film’s shocking and violent final scene, which leaves the viewer room for contemplation—but this sudden spike in intensity is jarring after almost 90 deliberate minutes of understated emotion. But even through this chaos, “Chronic” is a moving portrait of grief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hendrik Hertzberg ’65 has always been known for writing with style.
“He always had very beautiful handwriting, like calligraphy,” said friend Donald E. Graham ’66, former Crimson president, as he described Hertzberg’s distinctive copperplate script.
Hertzberg would always add a signature quirk: whenever he signed his initials—HH—he would never fail to jot a period at the end. Described as an “unusually thoughtful 19-year-old” by Graham, Hertzberg often said that people would know he was being kidnapped if the period was missing from his name.
Former roommate Andrew T. Weil ’63 described a prank that he and Hertzberg initiated during their time at Harvard, in which they utilized Hertzberg’s skill in lettering by giving Lowell House an impromptu renovation.

“We lived on the floor above a guest room and a visiting teacher’s room, and we got the idea of changing the name of the ‘guest room’ to the ‘guess room?’ with a question mark, and the ‘visiting teacher’s room’ to the ‘visiting preacher’s room,’” Weil said.
Playfully eccentric and charmingly stylish, Hertzberg’s personalized touch was not only reflected in his penmanship but also in his friendships, his writing, and his career successes as he progressed through his time at Harvard and in life.
Hertzberg, who now serves as a senior editor at the New Yorker, said that his time at Harvard—primarily his experiences at The Crimson and the relationships he formed with his classmates—was instrumental in setting the foundation for his career.
A JOURNALIST FROM THE START
Although Hertzberg said he received a “reasonably good” formal education in his first year or two of college, his Harvard experience was largely defined by his involvement with The Crimson, where he spent virtually all of his time working as managing editor.
“The Crimson really taught you how to write, and that was largely a function of the comment books,” Hertzberg said, referring to books in which Crimson editors would write comments about published pieces. “You were getting a constant running critique of your work from your colleagues, and that was the best pedagogical tool that I encountered in my years at Harvard.”
It was not uncommon for Hertzberg to work late into the night, a habit he carried with him throughout his life. “Many people are nocturnal as undergraduates, but few people will sustain that over time,” Graham said. “He plainly thought that those were his best hours, for whatever reason.”
Friends of Hertzberg’s remember that he rarely went to class, perhaps due to a combination of his late night hours and newspaper duties. “He would hang around and just procrastinate and procrastinate and then at the last minute he would just write a brilliant paper and pull it all off,” said former roommate Michael L. Silves ’65.
Hertzberg’s atypical sleep schedule and overarching dedication to The Crimson eventually landed him on academic probation for a semester. Although he was technically prohibited from participating in extracurricular activities, Hertzberg recalled that he kept writing under the pseudonym Sidney Hart.
In addition to his interest in reporting, many remember Hertzberg for his liberal political leanings.
“[Hertzberg] was outspoken about his views and political ideology. It was a unique way of looking at the world,” said fellow Crimson colleague Frederick H. Gardner ’63. He recalls Hertzberg being a great admirer of Socialist Party presidential candidate Norman M. Thomas and the Swedish system of government.
When not consumed by his duties as managing editor of the Crimson, Hertzberg was also the President of the Harvard Radcliffe Liberal Union, the operator of a jazz program on WHRB, and a member of the Signet Society. He met the majority of his friends through his extracurricular commitments, and he was highly regarded by those who knew him.
“Rick was wonderfully, impossibly gentle. He was a tough reporter and a beautiful writer, but as a friend he was so kind to others, so thoughtful,” Graham said.
Naturally skilled in social interactions, Hertzberg “always knew what was going on and who was going on,” according to Silves. “He just knew people, politically and socially. He had this raw charm about him—when he focused, and was interested in people, people would open up and tell him things, which made him a great reporter.”
A ‘SERENDIPITOUS’ CAREER
The connections that he made as an undergraduate at Harvard would propel Hertzberg forward later on in his life, especially in his writing career.
“I knew that I wanted to become a journalist from pretty much my junior year on, didn’t worry about it, and didn’t want to think too much about it,” Hertzberg said.
Instead of chasing after opportunities, for Hertzberg, opportunities fell into place. He describes his career as having evolved “more or less serendipitously” over time.
At the time, it was common for newspapers and magazines to have campus correspondent programs through which they would attract gifted student writers at Harvard. Hertzberg became a campus correspondent for Newsweek as an undergraduate and then eventually moved to San Francisco to work at the publication full-time after graduation.
Later on, Hertzberg landed a job as a staff writer at the New Yorker. “The editor at the New Yorker had a son in my class, and he used to read The Crimson to figure out what his son’s cohort was up to,” recalls Hertzberg, whose name had been a familiar staple in Harvard’s breakfast daily.
A few years later, when he was offered a chance to write a speech for then-governor of New York Hugh Carey, Hertzberg said that he saw an opportunity to combine his love of writing and politics and accepted without hesitation. For a time, he wrote speeches for Carey during the 1976 election, an experience that would prime him for bigger opportunities down the road.
When Jimmy Carter won the presidential election, his chief speechwriter was James M. Fallows ’70, who a few years earlier had been president of The Crimson. According to Hertzberg, “[Fallows] was looking for people to staff his speech writing, and the next thing I knew I was working at the White House.”
Hertzberg attributes this progression, like many others in his career, to the connections he made at Harvard, and friends say these connections were facilitated by his brilliance, passion, and integrity, qualities that he displayed as an undergraduate and carried with him throughout his life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To many, Terrence F. Malick ’65 is an enigma. The three-time-Oscar-nominated director, screenwriter, and producer—known for films Badlands, The Thin Red Line, and Tree of Life released in 1973, 1998, and 2011, respectively—maintains a notoriously protected private life, routinely declining requests for interviews and eschewing the Hollywood bubble.
However, Malick’s interests during his time at the College did not foreshadow what would become an accomplished cinematic career. Concentrating in philosophy, Malick did not participate in any extracurriculars other than a one-time run as Malvolio in an Adams House production of Twelfth Night, according to close friend Jacob R. Brackman ’65.
In the end, though, Malick’s relatively late start to film and appearingly unrelated knack for philosophy at the College contributed to his cinematic style and success.
HOOKED ON HEIDEGGER
Francis W. Metcalf ’65, Malick’s freshman year roommate, recalled an instance when Malick asked for Metcalf’s thoughts on a paper Malick had recently received back.
“The title was ‘Ontology and Heidegger’ or something like that, and there was a straight A. Maybe an A+,” Metcalf said. “The comment was from the grader: ‘Could I please have this paper back after you look over my comments because I’ve never seen such a good treatment of this difficult topic.’ Right then and there, the bells went off in my head.”
Malick’s academic interest in philosophy only grew stronger as the years went on, and under Philosophy professor Stanley L. Cavell, Malick graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa with a Rhodes Scholarship.
“He was unbelievably intelligent,” fellow Rhodes Scholar Curtis A. Hessler ’66 said. “He was renowned as probably the most brilliant student of philosophy at that time.”
Following graduation, Malick headed to Oxford University’s Magdalen College with the aim of writing a dissertation on German philosopher Martin Heidegger, which was a “no go from the start,” according to fellow Rhodes Scholar Jonathan D. Culler ’66.
“These were the days [when] Oxford was analytical philosophy,” Culler said. “The last thing anyone at the philosophy department there was supervise a dissertation on Heidegger. So he kept on hitting a blank wall.”
Culler remembered Malick at Oxford as “sardonic, funny, but distant,” as well as “somebody who knew his own mind and not easily influenced by instinct.” Malick eventually left Oxford after he “gave up in disgust” over disputes on his dissertation topic, according to Culler.
THE WANDERING YEARS
Following his departure from Oxford, Malick briefly lectured on philosophy at MIT, leaving to then pursue a short-term stint as a traveling freelance journalist, writing for Life, Newsweek, and the New Yorker.
“I think the years after college he was in sixes and sevens about what he wanted to do,” Hessler said. “He didn’t want to be an academic. He found it kind of stifling. He toyed with journalism because it was kind of adventurous... He was trying to bust out of stereotypes.”
When Brackman was hired to consult on the admissions board of the new Center for Advanced Film Studies in Beverly Hills in the summer of 1969, he urged Malick to apply. Malick agreed and earned a MFA from the institution for directing the short film Lanton Mills.
“When Terry's application came in, I told George [Stevens, Director of the American Film Institute] that whatever Terry wound up doing, of all the people I'd met in my years at Harvard, he was most likely to succeed,” Brackman wrote in an email. “Thirty years later, elderly George served as one of Terry's producers on The Thin Red Line.”
Following his graduation from the AFI Conservatory, Malick continued to pursue film, deciding to direct and write his own works following a disagreement with Paramount Pictures over Deadhead Miles. His first work, Badlands, starred Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek and gained acclaim at the New York Film Festival. His filmography since then has manifested itself in short, prolific bursts: following 1978’s Days of Heaven, he took a 20-year hiatus, working on a number of screenplays before returning with The Thin Red Line in 1998 and a small stream of short films leading up to the 2011 release of Tree of Life, his first contemporary film.
Notably, his films maintain an “immediately recognizable” aesthetic that reflects his interest in philosophy, his relative lack of lengthy formal training, and his experiences birdwatching with enthusiast Victor Emanuel, according to Brackman.
“His ignorance about normal filmmaking compared to most people who get to be directors…something that would have been his weakness…produced an extremely original style,” Brackman said. “Most people who are making films are riding for the brand: pleasing the studio, pleasing the producer, submitting to some kind of committee that is making suggestions to them. Nobody makes any suggestions to Terry. Terry is, by Hollywood standards, a total maverick.”
Throughout his unusual career path, Malick has remained driven, according to Brackman.
“Whatever he was doing—this was true of the piece he was working on for the New Yorker for maybe a year about Che Guevara and Regis Debray—he was extremely ambitious,” Brackman said. “If he was going to be making a film, he wanted to hit the ball out of the park. He was very conscious of that… He wanted to do something that was very big.”
Malick’s work has not gone unnoticed. The Thin Red Line won a Golden Bear award at the 1999 Berlin International Film Festival, and Tree of Life earned him a Palme D’Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. He has won numerous awards for best director, including for Days of Heaven at Cannes and for The Thin Red Line and Tree of Life at the Chicago Film Critics Association.
Despite the acclaim, Malick has remained largely elusive, except for a few select occasions. Hessler remembered an instance in which Malick brought Hessler’s wife to the Academy Awards.
“The only time I know of where he went to the Academy Awards…I was doing governmental things and my wife was alone here and he knew that and called her up and said he said, ‘Hey, we’re going to go to the Oscars!’” Hessler said.
Hessler also described Malick beyond the thoughtful deliberateness he brings to his cinematic work.
“He has the best sense of humor of anybody I’ve ever heard…He’s endlessly absurd and makes connections constantly,” Hessler said. “I’d love to see him make a comedy. None of us would survive it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harry Kraft passed away, he left an “ethical will” to his son Robert K. Kraft, a 1965 graduate of Harvard Business School.
According to Robert Kraft’s eldest son Jonathan A. Kraft, the will was meant to serve as a guide for how to live one’s life. It was centered around one of his father’s favorite quotes, something Robert has often repeated to his four children.
“When you go to bed at night, you ask yourself, ‘Is everyone who has come in contact with me today richer for having had that experience?’” recalled Jonathan Kraft, who received his MBA from the Business School in 1990. “When you meet and interact with people, be empathetic, [and] find out what’s going on in their lives. You can always be of help to other people, and in doing so and living your life in that way, you will create a good name for yourself. It’s much more valuable than any amount of money.”
Robert Kraft currently serves as the Chairman and CEO of the Kraft Group, a holding company with diverse assets in sports, real estate, and packaging—a role that enabled him to become a household name as the owner of the New England Patriots. With a more than $4 billion estimated fortune, he ranks among “Forbes 400 Richest Americans.”
Still, Kraft’s love for his family and passion for philanthropy have allowed him to live up to his father’s ethical will through prioritizing the needs of others, be it his sons or students at the Business School.
AN UNSURPRISING SUCCESS
Before he would become the businessman he is today, Robert Kraft grew up in Brookline, Mass., where his father worked in textiles and was an involved leader at Congregation Kehillath Israel, the family’s synagogue.
After graduating from Brookline High School in 1959, Robert Kraft went to Columbia University and graduated in 1963 as senior class president. Instead of immediately joining the workforce, he came to Cambridge to enroll at the Business School.
Those who observed Kraft in the classroom still remember him as thoughtful and academically adept.
“A memory I have of him was with professor [Theodore] Levitt, who was known for his scare tactics,” said Fred K. Foulkes, who was a member of the class of 1965’s Section C alongside Kraft. “One day, [Levitt] called on Bob and he did such a great job. I got to know him pretty well. He was very smart.”
Another classmate, Jean-Pierre J. Lehmann, noted that while Kraft was a very active participant in section, he “was not very present for socializing.”
“People who are married and are from Boston, they have their own life,” Lehmann said.
After marrying his late wife Myra in June 1963, Kraft had to reconcile his studies at the Business School with raising two sons—Jonathan, born during Kraft’s first year and Daniel, born during the second. The couple would go on to have two more children, Joshua and David.
Jonathan Kraft explained that his father sometimes regretted that he was not able to network as much as his classmates did due to his familial responsibilities.
But even with the challenges his schedule posed, his intelligence and skill in the classroom allowed him to excel. For this reason, schoolmates like Richard P. Kiphart have not been taken aback by his triumphs in the business world.
“He was very respectful of the teachers and the subjects,” Kiphart said. “I greatly respect him for what he has done. It is not a surprise that he was a great success.”
FAMILY FIRST 
As Kraft embarked on his career after graduating from the Business School, his son Joshua Kraft maintains that his father emphasized family above all else.
Jonathan Kraft marvels at how his father was able to strike a balance between work and children, given the lack of financial resources he had at the time and the strenuous demands of starting a business.
“I don’t ever remember my father, [when I was] a young boy, missing a birthday, missing a game, or not being home for dinner at 6 o’clock at night,” Jonathan Kraft said.
He described him as “a father and husband first, businessman second.”
Nevertheless, Kraft quickly advanced in his career. His first job after receiving his MBA was at the Rand-Whitney Group, a packaging company in Worcester owned by his father-in-law. After just three years, he acquired the majority share through a leveraged buyout in 1968.
Four years later, he started International Forest Products, a paper company. In 1994, he purchased the New England Patriots. Kraft eventually consolidated all of his business holdings to create the Kraft Group in 1998.
PAYING IT FORWARD
While much of Kraft’s public fame has been centered on his ownership of the Patriots, who have won four Super Bowl titles since 1994, he is known at Harvard for his donations of time and money.
Jonathan Kraft said that his father credits much of his financial success to having obtained a fellowship when he entered the Business School in 1963. Given his modest means, his son said, the fellowship enabled Robert Kraft to attend the Business School where he encountered ideas and peoples he likely would not have been exposed to otherwise. 
Kraft has used his wealth to “pay it forward” in gratitude for the financial assistance he received when he was a student, Nohria explained.
According to Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Kraft has endowed several fellowships, aimed at supporting students with an interest in healthcare. Additionally, Kraft serves as an Honorary Chair of the Business School’s capital campaign and assisted in kicking off the Dean’s Sports Challenge at the Innovation Lab in November.
Ultimately, as Robert Kraft termed it in a 2008 interview with the Harvard Business School Harbus, he lives by “the four F’s: family, faith, philanthropy . . . and football.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2014, Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.—the multi-million dollar student-run company founded in 1957—came under scrutiny when student-run food delivery service InstaNomz shut down after a little more than a month of operating. According to InstaNomz’s founders Akshar Bonu ’17 and Fanelesibonge S. Mashwama ’17, the Office of Student Life informed them they either had to assume an outside vendor status and lose internal dorm delivery privileges or work under HSA.
The occurrence led some students to criticize what they describe as HSA’s monopoly status granted by the University. The contemporary episode heralded back to HSA’s earlier days, when students in Feb. 1965 accused the organization of abusing its monopoly status by charging exorbitant prices for its charter flight service. Following a University investigation of HSA’s flight services, the University concluded that it was “entirely satisfied with the HSA operation.”
However, criticisms of HSA’s transparency and business practices from members of the student body abounded in the period between the University asking HSA to prepare “a complete report” on its charter flight services and its decision that reaffirmed HSA’s monopoly.
BEGINNING YEARS
In Harvard Student Agencies’ early years, its premier charter flight business organized up to 15 flights for Harvard students from Boston to various cities in Europe, including London, Paris, and Athens, according to Bradlee T. Howe ’63, a former HSA general manager who managed its charter flight agency in his senior year.
“I was working at just the sixth year of HSA’s existence, so it was still in some ways a fledgling organization, but we managed to run it, at least in ’63, while serving the Harvard community in very good order without any significant complaints about mixing up flights or not having seats for people or so forth,” Howe said.
Howe added that the 15 flights scheduled to Europe for the summer of 1963 were mostly through British Overseas Airways Corporation, with one Swiss Air flight, which HSA arranged through then-Harvard Square travel agency, University Travel. Exclusive to Harvard students, faculty, and alumni, the flights costed about $230 to $250 round trip.
Of note, HSA claimed a University-mandated monopoly on charter flights.
“There was a prescription about operating businesses from student dorm rooms, and the University was very conscious of not contravening that law and thereby making University property taxable as for unrelated business income,” Howe said. “The University...tended to funnel most business opportunities through the HSA.”
Howe also recalled that the business continued through the holidays and was generally well received by the Harvard student body. In fact, Columbia University modeled its own flight agency off of Harvard’s, according to an archived February 1965 issue of the Columbia Spectator.
MONOPOLY UNDER ATTACK
In February 1965, College students claimed that HSA’s flight prices were too expensive, costing more than those of the year prior and those of other universities like Columbia, allegedly resulting in exorbitant profits for the agency.
According to Crimson coverage at the time, BOAC unexpectedly terminated most of its charter operations, leaving HSA to make last minute negotiations with other airlines at inflated prices.
In response, Dean of Students Robert B. Watson, Dean of the College John U. Monro ’34, and administrative vice-president L. Gard Wiggins asked HSA to submit a report of its flight operations for review, with Wiggins ultimately deciding whether HSA should keep its at the time seven-year monopoly on charter flights or whether it should re-establish the competitive system.
In the interval period before the report was prepared and submitted, Stephen A. Sohn ’66 and Stephen Walters claimed they could organize charter flights to London and Paris, respectively at $240 and $260, for less than what HSA was charging, The Crimson reported.
However, once the administrators reviewed the report and deemed the prices “indeed reasonable and proper” at the end of February 1965, the University reiterated its decision to enforce HSA’s monopoly. To monitor the agency, a committee was formed to review their accounts once yearly.
The details of the report, and the agency’s figures, were not released to the public. Watson at the time declined to discuss details of the report “because if you release figures there are questions, and if you release more figures to answer the questions there are more questions, and soon all the figures are out.”
“They’re meaningless unless you have someone to explain them,” Watson said at the time.
With its monopoly reaffirmed, HSA subsequently rejected Sohn’s proposed cheaper flight out of fear that it would drain passengers from its previously chartered planes, and because HSA preferred to conduct business only with a single travel agency, University Travel, according to the Crimson archives. Sohn claimed at the time his offer was “reasonable and rational.”
“If charter flights are for the benefit of the students, this benefits the students completely,” Sohn said at the time.
Even with administrators taking action to address student allegations, College students did not voice complete satisfaction. “The International Air Transport Association requires that prospective passengers be given estimates of expected costs and that detailed financial statements be issued after every flight. Whether or not the HSA believes itself exempt from these regulations...it has an obligation to the community to furnish the information,” read the Crimson.
VESTIGIAL WINGS
Although the business eventually crumbled with the decline of commercial airline flight prices, the charter flights operation has left a mark on the agency and on Harvard in the form of the HSA’s travel guide series, ‘Let’s Go.’
“The charter flight was a mainstay of the HSA, and in 1961 it spawned the ‘Let’s Go’ guides, which essentially became the mainstay of the HSA, and it was all part of the growth of the agency,” Howe said.
Patrick F. Scott ’16, current HSA president, also emphasized the role the charter flights had in forming the travel guide series.
“Eventually, some students realized that the people on these flights were getting to Europe and they didn't know what to do once they got there, so they started handing out pamphlets on the flights to Europe,” Scott said. “The ‘Let's Go’ series has survived to this day and still publishes a Let's Go: Europe book, written by Harvard students, annually.”

Marshall L. Ganz ’64, then a junior at Harvard, walked into a meeting in Atlanta where he had planned to speak with members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
It was 1964, and amid the ongoing fight for de facto voting rights in the South, the SNCC was developing a relationship with Harvard students involved in civil rights movements on campus as they planned their next move. Ganz was expecting to find a somber scene as the SNCC prepared for the turbulent summer ahead. Instead, the group was engaged in a “preach-off”—competing to see who could deliver the best impression of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
For Ganz, the environment, what he described as the “intersection of pain and hope,” was intoxicating. “There was a joyfulness in this struggle,” he said. “A secondary dimension to it that along with the challenge made it very, very appealing.”
Ganz saw among the members of the SNCC a need for change alongside an excitement for the task ahead, both of which he had not found at Harvard. Ganz returned to Harvard for the rest of the school year, but he would be back in the Deep South before long.
Ganz was one of many Harvard students who found ways to engage in activism while at school in Cambridge, in a community that many described as increasingly supportive of the civil rights movement. But ultimately, the urgency and importance of the work being done in the South drew many from Harvard to continue their activism there.
“My real education about race and politics and power came from Mississippi, not Harvard,” Ganz said.

MISSISSIPPI BOUND
As the SNCC and other groups organized on the ground in the South, civil rights involvement at Harvard was beginning to stir, mostly among a concentrated group of student activists.
“The civil rights movement was just coming into a lot of publicity around the nation, and Harvard students who had social consciousnesses were excited by it and looked to ways that we could get involved,” said Ellen Lake ’66.
Garland E. Allen, who in 1965 was a teaching fellow and senior tutor in Quincy House, described the attitude at Harvard as “quite favorable” to the civil rights movement. Still, for some students, Harvard could not provide the opportunities for activism and change that they hoped to effect in the South.
When the SNCC began mobilizing for the Mississippi Freedom Summer, a movement hoping to bring the Civil Rights Act of that June into de facto acceptance, Ganz’s path was clear: “For me it was like, ‘I need to be part of this. I need to go do that,’” he said.
In the summer of 1964, Ganz, who is now a senior lecturer at the Kennedy School, headed South for what he thought would be temporary involvement. Ganz and around 30 other Harvard students hoped that they as less frequent targets of police violence compared to black Southerners might be able to help the SNCC affect some change.
The night before he was scheduled to join the movement in Mississippi, Ganz got word that three fellow activists in the area had been kidnapped and murdered at the hands of the Klu Klux Klan. After the news of these deaths, the organizer of the group Ganz had joined gathered the students together for a meeting. “I’d like to to be able to tell you [that] you can just go home, you don’t need to do this,” he told the gathered crowd, according to Ganz. “But I can’t. You really do need to do this.”
“That was a moment of silence that felt like a year,” Ganz said. “That’s kind of when you really have to come to terms with, ‘why were you here.’”
Over the course of that summer, Ganz would eventually be arrested some five or six times—but “that was sort of standard fare,” he added.
Lake, who also attended the Mississippi Freedom Summer, was part of what she describes as an “active core” of Harvard students, many of whom had spent the previous year advocating for Harvard to divest from the Mississippi Power and Light Company, whose stakeholders held positions in the unofficially segregated local government.
Following the 1964 Freedom Summer, students at Harvard continued to picket University President Nathan M. Pusey’s office in favor of divestment from Southern companies, but there were not as many opportunities for students and faculty to be directly involved in movements in the South.
SELMA AND THE SOUTHERN COURIER
On Sunday, March 7, 1965, protesters planning to March from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, were stopped at the Edmund Pettus bridge by state troopers and local police. When the activists refused to turn back, police shot teargas and beat members of the crowd. Coverage of the violence of Bloody Sunday aired for more than two hours around the world, prompting a wave of activists from across the country, including a group of students and faculty from Harvard, to flock to Selma for a second march.

Among those moved by the Sunday coverage was Alvin C. Plantinga ’54, then a visiting Philosophy professor at Harvard. “We saw on television shots of the blacks being savaged and really reprehensible behavior on the part of the Southern police down there in Selma,” Plantinga said.
By Tuesday, Plantinga and a few other faculty and Divinity School students were on their way South. Soon after, a delegation of 30 members of the Harvard community, including Allen, flew down to Selma to participate in the last leg of the march.
As Allen, embarking on his first foray into activism, began what he described as the the hot, dusty march, he recalled seeing police officers and dogs lining the route, a sight which he described as “intimidating.”
But further down the line, the road was flanked not just by police officers but also by supporters, black and white. “That was one of the lessons I learned—how important it is for all sorts of people to work together on these things,” Allen said. “The political lessons that came out for me was that all these kind of issues including the war...have to be joint efforts and can’t be something done by one community alone.”

By the time he reached Montgomery, Allen said he was no longer afraid. “You could sense the power of the crowd as opposed to a few individuals and that was certainly overcame any real sense of fear.”
As Plantinga and the Divinity students began their march, Plantinga said that they were met with a road lined by white Selma residents wielding sawed-off baseball bats.
“I was to some degree kind of frightened, and I was also thinking we were doing the right thing,” Plantinga said. He recalled one Divinity student—“obviously not the kind of person who had gotten in fights or played football”—who had been terrified by the sight of the bat-wielding crowds. “But he just kept on going anyway, and I admired him for that,” Plantinga said.
As the marches wound down in Alabama, another wave of activism was beginning to mobilize back in Cambridge.
Over the past several months, Lake, a junior at the time, and some friends had been raising money and building a team comprised mainly of Crimson editors to do what no established newspaper dared at the time: cover the civil rights movement from within the Deep South itself.With fellow Crimson editor Peter Cummings ’66 and the $30,000 the group had managed to raise over the last academic year, Lake set up the Atlanta headquarters of what would become the Southern Courier, a weekly newspaper staffed by Harvard students and local African American students. For Lake, the work was filling a critical void.“There was no such thing as local papers of the civil rights movement, except if there was a bomb or something there might be coverage, but it was never in the least bit sympathetic. It was always viewed as they, the civil rights people, were the bad guys,” Lake said. “If you were black in Alabama or Mississippi, you were just not in the paper unless you’d committed a crime. And so we were the voice of the black community.”
For Lake and Michael S. Lottman ’61 , who took over the Courier after Lake returned to Harvard for her senior year, the paper also had another function. “Often just having a Courier reporter show up somewhere might be enough for things to change,” Lake said. “Just like good journalism has an impact in changing things, the Southern Courier being an independent and spunky little paper would change what happened.”

‘THE WAY THAT THINGS TURN OUT’
In the months after the Selma marches, Lottman continued to steer the Courier through coverage of everything from at least monthly police shootings to speeches by King, in addition to the local Black Panther movement and the Supreme Court ruling on miscegenation laws.
“It affects the way that things turn out,” he said.
After the Courier, Lottman tried to return to a conventional journalism career, but found it a difficult transition. “It was a hell of a lot more fun doing the Courier, and a lot more important, I thought at the time,” he said. Lottman became a civil rights lawyer after studying in Alabama.
After finishing his program at Harvard, Allen moved to St. Louis, where he found avenues to continue the activist work he began in Selma through his involvement in voter registration drives and anti-Vietnam War protests and sit-ins.
“I think it was a legacy of having been involved in the Selma thing that I realized I had to put my money where my mouth was, so to speak,” Allen said. “I felt that the lessons I had learned from Selma about taking part were something I was carrying with me.”
It would be almost 30 years before Ganz would make his way back to Harvard to finish his undergraduate degree after the Selma march. Swept up in the momentum of the civil rights movement, Ganz next headed west to join Cesar Chavez, the founder and leader of the United Farm Workers. Ganz said in a letter to the University that he was not sure when he’d be able to return, writing, “How can I come back and study history when I’m busy making history?” He laughed. “Which was a pretty arrogant thing to say, but it was also kind of true.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students’ fears of being drafted for the Vietnam War, compounded with low dropout and withdrawal rates, caused Harvard undergraduate enrollment levels to rise dramatically in the 1960s. At Radcliffe alone, the student body swelled by roughly 100 students between 1959 and 1967, which administrators at the time said was due to decreasing rates of attrition rather than larger entering classes.
As a result of the higher enrollments, the ten existing Houses became increasingly full in the years leading up to 1970, and while the College did have plans to build more students beds, first in Mather and then in Currier, the years before these openings proved a difficult time for the College and its growing number of students.
The overcrowding had a multifaceted impact upon the student experience: most found themselves in cramped rooming situations, some had to move into overflow housing at Claverly Hall, which is now part of Adams House, and others resorted to leaving the House system entirely for off-campus residences.
In the fall of 1964, about 140 Harvard students made the switch to off-campus housing, with many of them making the choice “out of the College’s convenience” to spare much-needed space in the House system. Meanwhile, at Radcliffe, 32 students did the same.
Despite the close-quartered living conditions, alumni from the era remember their time at Harvard in a positive manner, with many citing their House experiences as a focal point of their college experience. Most students elected to remain in the Houses despite the challenges posed by overcrowding. These undergraduates felt that living among their peers, as well as the robust social environment within the Houses, helped to foster class cohesion and community.
WAR AND PEACE
The problem of house overcrowding was not a new one in the 1960's at the College. Houses first experienced additional population surges in the years shortly following World War II, as many military veterans arrived on campus after the war ended in 1945. In the middle of 1944, fewer than 700 students were enrolled in the College. By 1947, this number had increased more than sevenfold to more than 5300 students.
At the time, newly-passed G.I. bills incentivized the move back to campus, with millions of government dollars poured into living expenses and tuition for veterans, who made up more than half of the class of 1949. To compensate for the growth, the University packed more students into the existing housing stock and built several new temporary residences. The increased enrollment became permanent, as numbers never returned to their pre-war level of around 3500 students.
Nearly two decades later, with the Vietnam War in full swing, male students attending Harvard during the late 1960's adjusted their lifestyles and education plans to avoid the Selective Service, or wartime draft lottery, that was overwhelmingly unpopular among the generation.
The draft placed preference on younger, non-married males who were not enrolled in an institution of higher learning; thus, many students put off leaves of absences that had once been common during one’s tenure at the College, according to current Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
In order to evade military service, students forfeited intended leaves and remained at the College, in turn causing the student body to swell and Houses to adjust to the sudden growth. While patriotic duty had led to overcrowding, the lack of active support for a controversial war had the same effect.
FULL HOUSE
The expanded Harvard and Radcliffe student bodies meant that University administrators had to reconcile constrictions of limited space with over enrollment.
According to Dingman, an alumnus of Eliot House, three-person suites were often converted into four-person ones. “Things were tight,” he said. “Eliot House was filled up.”
During Dingman’s sophomore year at Harvard, he and his roommates lived in overflow housing at Claverly Hall to free up space. As of October 1964, around 120 Harvard undergraduates lived in Claverly.
At the time, the College was very “creative with the use of space,” Dingman said.
Still, students and administrators acknowledged that the enrollment situation posed challenges to the residential House system.
"With the 260 students living off or in Claverly and those in suites that should be deconverted, we could almost fill another house right now," then-Dean of the College Robert B. Watson said in an interview in 1964.
The difficulties stretched up Garden Street to Radcliffe Quadrangle, as well.
Catharine P. Roth ’67, who lived in North House, remembers Radcliffe College’s creativity in housing as well. “Some of the larger rooms they divided into small singles,” Roth said. “The singles that they had were pretty small.” According to Roth, bunk beds were also frequently used to save space.
Still, some students, discontented with cramped and uncomfortable on-campus housing arrangements, abandoned the Houses entirely.
George L. Cushing ’65, a former resident of Winthrop House, remembers classmates moving off campus as a result of the conditions. “I had roommates who left and got a place up in Somerville,” he said. Another classmate of Cushing’s who had previously served in the military chose to move off campus after returning to the College. According to Cushing, his classmate preferred having a living space of his own after deployment.
HOUSE AS A HOME
Despite the shortage of space, ultimately most students elected to remain in their respective Houses due to the unique atmosphere of the residential community, the company of their peers, and the convenient central location.
“I stayed in [my House] the whole time,” Roth said. “I was happy to have someone take care of meals and all.”
Many alumni still mention House dining halls as a factor contributing to the richness of their on-campus life.
Cushing said that moving off campus “wasn’t part of what I was interested in. I liked being close on campus, and being in the dining room.” According to Roth and Cushing, dining halls served as a social hub for students, and that the food and environment were generally enjoyed by all.
“I can’t emphasize enough the value of the dining experience,” Cushing said.
Paul H. Guzzi ’65 cited his overall experiences in Eliot House as a significant contribution to his college memories. “The housing experience for me was one of the most positive aspects of my experience at Harvard,” he said.
Additionally, according to Dingman, alternative housing such as Claverly and off-campus residences had an effect of negative displacement from both academic and social spaces. Dingman said that residents of Eliot House proper reaped the benefit of just a short walk from their rooms to the dining hall, unlike the more cumbersome one he and his roommates faced.
“We were taking our meals down in Eliot, so it meant going south down the the River, and north to classes,” Dingman said.
Charles P. Whitlock, a Dudley House tutor in the 1960's, also recognized the difficulties of living off campus at the time.
"The commuting [student] is at somewhat of a disadvantage," Whitlock said in an interview with The Crimson in 1965. "Living at home often makes it impossible for him to meet members of the faculty."
Finally, off-campus residents found it more difficult to participate in extracurricular activities than their peers in the Houses—only small fractions of these students were able to hold leadership positions in student groups, the Crimson reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a senior at the College organizing demonstrations against the Vietnam War, David M. Kotz ’65 faced both physical and ideological opposition from his fellow students.
According to Kotz, who presided over the Harvard chapter of Students for a Democratic Society—a national student activist organization—he and his protesting colleagues confronted insults and dodged water balloons hurled from the windows of freshman dorms.
Yet when Kotz returned four years later in 1969 as an alumnus to support ongoing anti-war protests, he recalled students shouting words of encouragement instead.
During his time at the College, Kotz rallied and marched when the U.S. had demonstrated increasing engagement in the region. In 1964, Congress enacted the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, giving then-President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority over U.S. involvement in the war between North and South Vietnam. Johnson also approved the sustained bombing campaign of North Vietnam, known as Operation Rolling Thunder, in Feb. 1965.
The change in student reception that Kotz recalled marked a large uptick in anti-Vietnam War beliefs on campus—one that parallelled changing sentiments across the country. In April of 1969, this culminated in the student takeover of Harvard’s University Hall, which resulted in 13 students being asked to withdraw from the University and more than 100 others facing administrative consequences.
Prior to this changing wave of support, however, protesters in the ’64-65 academic year laid the foundation for the anti-Vietnam War student movement that came into fruition during the latter half of the decade.
A NATURAL PROGRESSION

In its initial stages, the anti-Vietnam War movement attracted those at the College who had previously engaged in other political causes and who drew upon their earlier experience in their anti-war activities, according to its on-campus leaders.
During her freshman year, C. Quentin Davis ’65 joined Tocsin—a student organization founded in 1960 that called for nuclear disarmament in the midst of the Cold War.
Although Tocsin disassembled about four years later, the group was considered to be “far and away the most vigorous and dynamic student political group in Cambridge,” according to an article in the 1965 Harvard yearbook by former Crimson managing editor Hendrik Hertzberg ’65.
The radical politics of the group served as a springboard for the anti-Vietnam War movement that manifested in Davis' senior year and paved the way for a Harvard chapter of SDS.
Kotz and Peter Orris ’67, both former presidents of the Harvard chapter of SDS, said they participated in the Mississippi Freedom Summer in 1964, where they forged connections with other activists.
For her part, Davis said she was influenced by her parents’ involvement in the Civil Rights movement growing up as well as her previous work with Tocsin. This interest in student activism eventually led to her briefly considering dropping out of college to protest the Vietnam war.
Though Davis decided to stay until graduation, she said that she and many of her activist peers would reflect back on past movements, including the Civil Rights movement, as inspiration for their tactics.
“The Civil Rights movement was a great influence [on the Vietnam War protests],” Davis said. “[Civil Rights activists] taught us with their blood and their weeks, months, years in jail...We learned a lot from them.”
GAINING SUPPORT: AN UPHILL BATTLE
Two student organizations, SDS and the May Second Movement (M2M), spearheaded the the anti-Vietnam War movement on campus. According to Orris, however, support was fairly minimal at the time.

“Students who were involved in these activities were really far out on the left and really a small minority,” Orris said.
Cort B. Casady ’68, a sympathizer with the anti-war movement, echoed Orris’s sentiment.
“When we started at Harvard in 1964, the movement was small,” Casady said. “America hadn’t really awakened to the realities of the war.”
However, Kotz remembered the first appearance of the anti-war movement at Harvard as a series of Crimson articles published by Kathie Amatniek Sarachild ’64 in 1962, which sparked “a lot of debate on campus.”
Though members of the Harvard community regarded Sarachild as “a crazy communist,” according to Kotz, the information she produced was widely known and accepted within a few years.
The Harvard chapter of SDS also played a role in one of the earliest national student anti-war demonstrations. Five SDS chapters at colleges nationwide organized a March on Washington on April 17, 1965, with more than 200 Harvard students participating.
According to Kotz and Orris, their initial expectation of 10,000 participants was far exceeded by the actual turnout.
“It was an extremely empowering experience...people, white and black, mostly young people, demanding basic change in society,” Kotz said. “Participating in the Mississippi Freedom Summer had changed the course of my life to being an activist for social change. That demonstration cemented it.”
The years 1964 and 1965 brought several anti-war protests, picketing actions, and teach-ins on Harvard’s campus and in the greater Cambridge community. M2M handed out weekly news pamphlets, which brought further attention to the student activists. Although there were also active pro-war protestors, their participation became more and more infrequent as the anti-war movement progressed, according to Casady, as it became increasingly difficult to defend the war.
“We weren’t saying ‘we’re right, you’re wrong,’” Davis said. “We just have humanity’s interest at heart and this war is wrong.”
LOOKING FORWARD
The protests and marches in 1964 and 1965 were merely the beginning of a movement that would continue into the late ’60s and early ’70s.
“It was a very emotionally charged time, I would say, because it was clear that the war was raging on,” Casady said. “It went on for a number of years after we graduated.”
Now-Harvard alumni who were students at the time pointed to a few events that contributed to the potential rise of student support during their time at the College. For Wayne L. Cole ’68, Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination a month before he was slated to speak at the graduation ceremony for the Class of 1968 politicized the student body to rise up in solidarity.
Orris said the rise in media and news coverage of the Vietnam War largely played into the increase in student support. He added that seeing the battle on television in particular provided a sense of urgency because “for the first time, [the war] was real.”
“When people found out that the truth [of what was happening in] Vietnam was more or less the opposite of what the government was saying, it radicalized young people,” Kotz said. “There was really kind of a revolutionary mood. People had gradually come to the position that American society was unjust.”
As the years progressed and the war in Vietnam escalated, the student anti-war movement also started to take off from its initial 1965 vantage point.
“It was an exciting time be at Harvard,” Cole said. “It was a time of social awakening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After six years at Lavietes, Christian Webster ’13 is moving on.
The University of Central Florida announced Monday that it had hired the former assistant coach of the Harvard men’s basketball team to the same position. Webster will join UCF coach Donnie Jones, who is looking to build up a program that finished near the bottom of the American Athletic Conference in 2015 with a 12-18 overall record.
“It was a great opportunity for me to not just get away from Harvard but keep growing,” Webster said. “They were looking for someone young, that could recruit, and that could bring energy to the program. I felt like I fit that mold pretty well.”
During Webster’s six years at Harvard, the Crimson qualified for the NCAA tournament four times and twice won opening round games. In his final season in uniform, Webster was the sole senior on a squad that lost Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 and Kyle Casey ’13-’14 early in the season but won 20 games and reached the third round of the NCAA Tournament.
Webster will hope to bring that same attitude to a Knights program that has not made the NCAA tournament since 2005. Under Jones, the Knights have finished 88-70 over five seasons—never finishing higher than third in conference play and making the NIT just once.
“One of the things that I talked about with Coach Jones is bringing the energy,” Webster said. “That’s something that [Harvard] coach [Tommy] Amaker has always talked about, even when I was a player.”
The choice to leave Harvard was not an easy one for Amaker’s protege. Leaving his mentor, a man that he called his “dad away from home for six years,” was difficult, Webster said.
Ultimately, Amaker encouraged his former player to take the opportunity presented to him and, like many before him, take steps outside the Harvard bubble.
