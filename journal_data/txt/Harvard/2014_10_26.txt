After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust laid out her “case for college” in a speech Friday morning in Dallas, encouraging students gathered at a local high school not necessarily to attend Harvard, but to consider continuing their educations beyond the high school level.
Though she began by laying out the tangible indicators—wealth, employment, and civic engagement—that are often used to encourage college attendance, Faust spent the bulk of her talk arguing that college is critical for reasons that can’t necessarily be measured.
First, she positioned college as a door-opener, saying that it provides students with new and often unforeseen opportunities.
“College is a passport to different places, different times, and different ways of thinking,” she said, focusing on courses and opportunities offered by Harvard but also by Texas schools like Baylor and Texas A&M. “It is a chance to understand ourselves differently, seeing how our lives are both like and unlike those of people who inhabited other eras, other lands.”
Faust’s second point centered on the people that make up colleges and universities.
“Even if you go to a school that is local and continue to live at home, your classes will be full of people you’ve never encountered, with views and experiences new to you,” she said, according to her prepared remarks. “One of the most important ways in which students learn, at colleges and universities everywhere, is by interacting with people who are different from themselves.”
Faust added that by engaging with the work of historic figures in many disciplines students might figuratively “meet” people like Albert Einstein and Toni Morrison.
The Harvard president then argued that college allows students to dream big and, as importantly, to “think slow” in a fast-moving world.
“In business, huge profits can be made by firms that know more, act first, or connect faster. But there is a different kind of profit, a more lasting one, available to those willing to slow down and bear down on a difficult problem,” she said. “College can help you learn how to think, more than what to think.”
In closing, Faust echoed previous speeches in talking about the late Harry Parker, the longtime Harvard men’s crew coach who died last year.
“One of Harvard’s most beloved coaches, a man named Harry Parker, was described by one of his athletes as ‘making people prove themselves to themselves,’” she said. “For some, a coach holds up that mirror. For others, it may be a mentor, a co-worker, a parent, or a friend. But I want to leave you with this thought: For many people, that mirror is college, a mirror like no other—showing us what is possible, challenging us to raise our sights, asking us: ‘Do you want to be that?’”
The speech, delivered at Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, was Faust’s final public event during a weeklong trip that took her first to Mexico City, where she hosted a private alumni gathering for about 500 attendees. Later Friday night, Faust appeared a similar gathering in Dallas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team (13-4, 6-2 Ivy) rolled to its fifth consecutive win and put on a clinic on Friday night, dispatching visitor Dartmouth (13-6, 4-4) in three straight sets.
The Big Green had taken the other meeting between these two earlier on in the season and in its home gym, the Crimson very much felt like this was an opportunity for revenge.
“This game was super important to us because they beat us the first time around,” senior co-captain Caroline Walters said. “We didn’t think they should have, so we came out with a vengeance tonight.”
Sophomore libero Whitney Hansen echoed those sentiments, and cited increased self-confidence from last weekend’s performances as key factors in the victory.
“Last weekend, we came back down by two [sets] against Penn, and that gave us a lot of confidence to go on and sweep Princeton,” Hansen said. “We were really ready to beat Dartmouth [tonight] from the confidence of last weekend. We came out ready to play because we really wanted to prove [that] we were the better team.”
The home team came out swinging from the get go and did not let up all night as Dartmouth simply wilted under the power of the Harvard offense. Any time the Crimson was able to control the ball and pass it to one of their numerous attacking options, there was a feeling in the crowd that the point was going to be over soon. There was an easy confidence about the home team, and after an edgy first few points, an 8-0 run midway through the first set behind the serving of Walters set the tone for the night.
“Once we started playing, we realized everyone was on and playing well together and playing together,” Walters said. “We loosened up and kept that confidence going throughout the game.”
The floodgates opened and the rest of the match was an onslaught. Middle blocker Caroline Holte had a career night. The junior has averaged 2.05 kills per set this season but laid down 11 on only 15 attempts to go with five blocks. Sophomore outside hitter Grace Weghorst also came into her own with an 11-kill barnstormer, mixing in four aces from her potent serve to boot. Stalwarts Walters and sophomore setter Corinne Bain also feasted with seven kills apiece.
Great offense can only come from great defense, which Walters credited for the offensive output.
“[The offense] actually started with our defense,” Walters said. “We had amazing digging and so stopped all of their attacks, and we definitely just spread out the hits, and there were a lot of open spots on the block. Everyone was just really on.”
After Harvard steamrolled to a 25-13 first set win, the second set was a more even affair. While the offense still hummed to the tune of a .500 killing percentage, the defensive prowess slacked a bit for the Crimson. The Big Green was stifled in the opening set, but some valiant hitting by Dartmouth sophomore Emily Astarita kept things close with the visitors in striking distance after a mini-run down 16-17.
Serving was another area of prowess for the Crimson. Hansen added that Big Green often struggled to defend because they were out of position after a big Harvard serve.
“We had them out of system a lot because we were serving aggressively,” Hansen said. “They couldn’t really match our offense.”
The third set was over really before it began. The Dartmouth squad appeared simply deflated by the end of the night. Harvard never let up on its way to a comfortable 25-18 set win to wrap up the match.
It’s fairly rare to see three set victories in what is on a weekly basis a hard-fought and competitive Ivy League. However, volleyball at its core is a game of runs and when a team gets going, it can become unstoppable.
That was Harvard on Friday night.
“I think we had one of our best matches of the season,” Hansen said. “We had our [stuff] together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When sophomore midfielder Cat Caro scored to give the Princeton field hockey team a 1-0 lead over Harvard, the game was far from over. Forty five minutes of play remained and offered the Crimson more than enough time to press the Tigers’ defense and threaten to equalize.
But after Caro’s goal, it was Princeton that did more of the threatening. By recording nine second half shots compared to just two from Harvard, the Tigers (5-9, 4-1 Ivy) proved that the best defense is a solid offense and held on for a 1-0 victory over the Crimson (8-6, 2-3) in Princeton, N.J.
“We needed to come out with a more aggressive attitude,” senior midfielder Caitlin Rea said. “I feel that if we were capable of changing our attitude, we would have [had] more opportunities.”
The Crimson’s loss dropped the team below .500 in the Ivy League standings for the second time this season. With two games left in conference play, Harvard is tied for fifth in the Ancient Eight.
“This loss was tough to take,” Rea said. “However, we are mentally strong as a team this year. We are excited to continue to perform and play in the Ivy League.”
The game began with a flurry of attacks from the Tigers. In the first two minutes, Princeton earned a penalty corner and smacked two shots, including one that rebounded off the post.
“They came out really strong and were super aggressive, especially in the first half,” senior forward Noel Painter said. “Next time we need to step up sooner.”
Harvard’s defense soon responded, and the game settled into a defensive stalemate punctuated with substitutions instead of shots. After the Princeton’s burst of offense within the first 10 minutes, the teams combined for only four shots before the Tigers scored in the 31st minute.
Junior back Elizabeth Jacobson almost broke the stalemate in the 26th minute. Her shot on goal forced Princeton’s goalkeeper to make her first save of the game.
“I think the whole team held Princeton,” Jacobson said. “We stayed tight on our marks and had good communication in the back field.”
With four minutes left in the half, Caro finally broke the deadlock, scoring her fourth goal of the year. She collected the ball at the top of the circle and fired a backhanded shot that found the back of the net.
Just as in the first half, Princeton came out firing early in the second frame. In the 42nd minute, the Tigers peppered Crimson goalkeeper Issy Davies with several shots on net. But Davies repelled the attack to keep Harvard within one goal.
As the second half opened, the Crimson adopted a more offensive mindset. Still, Princeton managed this pressure with a bunched defensive unit. The Crimson mustered only two shots in the second half and none in the last 10 minutes of play.
“We competed more in the second half and maintained [our] attack,” Rea said. “Once we were more aggressive, we stepped in front of them and created more opportunities in our outletting...[but] the Tigers played solid defense in our offensive 25, making it hard for us to enter the circle.”
Princeton’s Sydney Kirby tormented the Harvard defense throughout the game. Although the senior midfielder did not score, she took six shots with three on target. As a team, Princeton recorded six attempts on goal.
The defeat continues an up-and-down pattern that has defined the Crimson’s season thus far. After starting the campaign with five consecutive wins, Harvard dropped four of the next five contests, including an Ancient Eight loss to Penn.
“We will need to stay focused and work on our game,” Jacobson said. “Having a strong practice on Monday is key.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Conner Hempel missed four of the football season’s first five games with a back injury. But the Harvard senior quarterback made up for a significant amount of his squandered statistics in the sixth game against Princeton.
In his first start since the opener against Holy Cross, Hempel made his presence felt all over the field. The senior completed 25-of-31 passes for three touchdowns, and he rushed for an additional two. There was not a single individual more responsible for the Crimson’s 49-7 win over the Tigers in New Jersey than Hempel.
A large part of the quarterback’s success stemmed from his ability to improvise. Throughout the game, Hempel evaded tacklers and extended plays, using his legs to free himself and find open receivers.
Such intangibles characterized Harvard’s first touchdown of the day. On the Crimson’s (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) third drive, Hempel spun away from two blitzing Princeton (3-3, 2-1) defenders, dashed his way toward the left sideline, and fired a bullet to sophomore wide receiver Joseph Foster, who weaved his way through the defense for a 39-yard score.
Hempel propelled his team into the end zone three more times before the end of the first half, highlighted by a perfectly thrown 49-yard fade route to senior wide receiver Seitu Smith.
Many quarterbacks would have been more than satisfied with a full game of Hempel’s numbers just from the first half—after two quarters, the senior had racked up 264 yards in the air on 20-of-22 passing, had accounted for four touchdowns, and had led Harvard with 34 yards rushing.
“[Hempel’s] improvisational ability is something that’s really tough to defend,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We get to extend plays; we get additional yardage with our quarterback running the football. The combination is something that you just can’t coach.”
DEFENSIVE DOMINATION
While Hempel and the offense accounted for the points, the Crimson defense had the Tigers’ attack on lockdown for the entire game.
Midway through the fourth quarter, Princeton’s drive chart was dismal, to say the least: on 14 possessions, the home team had punted 12 times, fumbled once, and turned the ball over on downs. The Tigers finished with just 244 yards and their lowest point total of the season.
“It’s always great when everybody’s out here flying around, not taking no for an answer,” Harvard captain Norman Hayes said.
The Crimson registered only one sack on the day, but consistent pressure combined with effective coverage in the secondary ensured that Princeton could never get its rapid-fire offense going. While the Tigers employed trickery and spread the field horizontally, they rarely attacked the Harvard defense downfield.
Princeton avoided a shutout on its last possession, finally getting on the scoreboard with a touchdown against second-string Harvard defenders.
“They’re a good defense,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “We had only the one turnover, but we’re not getting turnovers on defense. That’s a big part of why we are where we are right now. Their front really squeezed the holes. They did a great job with that.”
THIRD TIME’S THE CHARM
The drama was aplenty the last two times Harvard and Princeton faced off on the gridiron. From 29 unanswered Tigers points in the 2012 fourth quarter to a triple-overtime contest last year, Princeton found thrilling and creative ways to defeat its rival.
Things could not have been more different on Saturday, as Harvard dominated from start to finish. Even with the teams’ past history in mind, the outcome of the game was effectively decided by halftime.
“It got away from Princeton, and we’ve all been there,” Murphy said. “We’ve been on the other end of it.”
While the Crimson amassed a school record 698 yards of offense, Princeton only managed 244 after averaging nearly 470 yards in the teams’ last two meetings. Tigers quarterback Quinn Epperly threw for six touchdowns last year, but he posted just 66 passing yards on Saturday.
Harvard’s previous largest margin of victory over Princeton was 34 points—a differential that was shattered in 2014.
“I told the guys in the locker room, it’s probably the best week of practice we’ve had since I’ve been here for Harvard,” Surace said. “Some things you can’t explain.”

Shoutout to all of the sophomores currently undergoing an existential crisis due to the rapidly approaching concentration declaration deadline. What better way is there to procrastinate making the decision that may determine your entire financial career than by reading tips on how to make said decision? Here’s a list of (sometimes conflicting) tips for choosing your concentration.
1. You do you
The best thing you can do when you’re declaring your concentration is to pick whichever concentration fits your personality best. That means ignoring your aunt Rita’s pleas that you go into government “like the Kennedys” and your father’s acute disapproval of your concentration in Women and Gender Studies.
2. Seek out help
You might think that you should consult your designated academic advisor, but Flyby is here to tell you you’re wrong. If you’re really looking for advice from someone who knows you well, the best person to consult is the good friend who’s always willing to bring you Felipe’s or Tasty Burger when it’s 1 a.m. and it’s been a rough night.
3. Financial possibilities matter
Pick the concentration that pays the best: Linguistics. It’s that simple.
4. Time
Make sure you don’t wait until the Nov. 12 deadline to declare your concentration. Turning in your plan of study early can give you a peace of mind (until you decide to change your concentration yet again).
5. Why declare concentrations again?
Even though sophomores have to declare their concentrations by Nov. 12, you’re not married to it. You can change it next year (possibly even later). Can anybody say commitment issues?
Oh, and pro-tip: In the real world, a concentration is called a major, in case you forgot.
