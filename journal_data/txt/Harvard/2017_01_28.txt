After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 28, 2017 at 9:56 p.m.
Hours after President Donald Trump closed off America’s borders to Syrian refugees and suspended immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries, over 150 Harvard affiliates assembled in the Square Friday evening in an “emergency protest” of Trump’s policies.
Gathered at the corner of JFK St. and Massachusetts Ave., students and faculty brandished homemade posters and chanted slogans in protest of an executive order Trump signed Friday halting the entry of all refugees into the United States for 120 days. The order suspends immigration from seven Middle Eastern countries for 90 days, and bars Syrians—including refugees—from entering the United States indefinitely.
The protest also came two days after Trump ordered a wall be built on the border between the United States and Mexico.
“We’ve all been pretty crippled by the horrible news that’s been coming out, but more so by the uncertainty of what’s to come,” Hazami Barmada, an organizer and student at the Kennedy School, said to protesters. “But this [protest] is not anything political.”
“This is not about us being anti-anything,” Barmada added. “This is about us being for something—for justice, for peace, for humanity.”
The Global Justice Working Group, a student activist group at the Kennedy School, led the “impromptu” rally, according to Rana Abdelhamid, another organizer and Kennedy School student. Protesters chanted “The people, united, will never be divided” in both English and Spanish between speeches from organizers and activists. In addition to students from the Kennedy School, students from the College, Law School, and School of Public Health also joined the rally.
The protest follows similar ones at the College and nationwide in support of immigrants, women, and other minorities whom Trump has at times targeted with statements and policy proposals.
“Welcome to the resistance!” Timothy P. McCarthy, a History and Literature lecturer who also teaches at the Kennedy School, said to kick off the protest.
“This is the time for resistance. It is a time for opposition. But it is also a time for us to all come together across different races and across from all the different places where we work—to come together to take the country back from the forces that are trying to steal it from us and deny us our fundamental human rights,” McCarthy said.
Some attendees said they were there to demonstrate unity and stand behind those who will likely be affected by Trump’s executive orders.
Jesus Reyes Ruiz, a student at the Kennedy School and a member of the school’s Mexican Caucus, said that he attended the rally to represent “the Mexican community here” but also stand in solidarity with “our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters.”
“The most important thing that we’re here to show support for is standing against the executive actions that have been issued by the President,” he said. “We believe them to be profoundly un-American.”
Paul A. Ochoa, a student at the Kennedy School and native of Tijuana, Mexico, said he wanted to support his hometown and rally against the proposed border wall.
“If you don’t know Tijuana, it’s the border city of San Diego and Mexico,” Ochoa said. “We consider both cities...one big community and the idea that there be another wall—because there’s already a large fence there—doesn’t make sense.”
Ari Berman ’19 said she attended the rally out of concern for the impact Trump’s immigration restrictions will have on refugees. Most refugees, she said, “are escaping prosecution and radicalization and just trying to rebuild their lives, which have been torn to the ground.”
Closing out the rally, organizers called on attendees to stand with Muslims, women, and minorities who might be anxious about their future under the Trump administration.
“The power of the people is stronger than the people in power,” Abdelhamid said. “We did this in four hours. Imagine what we can do, and imagine what we’re going to continue to do, to fight against bigotry and to fight against discrimination in the next four years.”
Harvard students have also started organizing to attend similar protests of Trump’s policies in the Boston area on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

ITHACA, NY—They say history doesn’t repeat itself.
But with just under a minute left on the clock Friday night against Cornell, Harvard tried to do just that. After going down by as many as 12 against the Big Red, the Crimson was within a point. Freshman guard Bryce Aiken drove inside and nearly falling kicked the ball out to freshman guard Justin Bassey. Bassey drained the corner three and gave Harvard the two point lead with 51 seconds left on the clock.
On its ensuing possession Cornell sophomore Matt Morgan drove inside and threw up what would have been the game tying layup only to be met by freshman forward Chris Lewis. With the shot clock running down the ball was in Aiken's hands again. Aiken drove inside and stepped back to the elbow. With eight seconds on the clock he pulled up and drained the two—and much like it had a year earlier, Harvard came away with the late win in another nailbiter in Ithaca off the hands of a freshman point guard. Last time, it was a 76-74 win off a jumper from then-freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy. This time, Aiken’s jumper sent Harvard home with a 77-71 victory.
“Bryce was sensational,” Amaker said. “He’s capable of literally putting us on his back in stretches. We’re so proud of him, that last shot. He knew he had it. That’s the confidence he plays with.”
What ended as a heartstopper began a lot differently. Two high scoring offenses showed up Friday in Ithaca and the first half was a lot of just that. Through the first frame the Big Red shot a striking 66 percent from the field.
Despite Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker’s squad being known for its depth, Cornell gave the Crimson a run for its money throughout the first period. All eight Big Red players who saw the floor in the first frame scored and as a whole the team only missed eight shots through the first 20 minutes of play. With Cornell getting open threes and easy backdoor cuts early, Amaker switched into a zone defense.
“I thought the zone was the difference,” Amaker said. “That enabled us to settle down, get some defensive boards, they missed some long-distance shots and we were able to kind of run out of the zone, transition out of it and that helped with our confidence.”
For its part the Crimson also came out shooting. Led by sophomore Corey Johnson who scored over a third of the Harvard’s 33 first-half points, Harvard shot nearly 50 percent from the field in the first frame.
But Harvard’s strong offensive performance could only keep them in striking distance. A late defensive breakdown gave Big Red senior Darryl Smith an easy dunk and Cornell ended the half up by seven, the largest deficit the Crimson has seen in conference this season.
Early in the second half, however, the Big Red only built on its lead. An early Harvard turnover gave the Big Red an early three and on its ensuing possession Cornell scored again to extend its lead to 12. From here the Crimson went on a 15-4 run to pull within one with just over ten minutes left on the clock.
From there, however, it was a story of two freshman. After scoring five points through the first period, Aiken exploded for 16 in the second half on 6-of-11 from the field. Bassey, who only had two at the half, put up 14 and did not miss a shot in the second period. The two combined for 30 of the Crimson’s 44 second half points and in a crowd of Big Red faithful, did quite a bit of silencing.
“It was a rough environment,” Aiken said. “They had a good showing from the audience and it really helped their momentum throughout the game but we just stuck together through thick and thin and we came out on top, able to pull out the ‘W’.”
The win keeps Harvard undefeated in conference and gave the Crimson it’s 10th win in 11 games.
“I just thought our team really gave incredible effort late and believing they could pull it out,” Amaker said. “It just says a lot about our team, especially for a lot of our young guys.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Justin Bassey buried a corner three to put the Harvard men’s basketball team up two with 51 seconds to play and classmate Bryce Aiken drilled a dagger from the elbow to lift the Crimson (11-5, 3-0 Ivy League) to a dramatic 77-71 victory over Cornell (5-13, 1-2) on Friday evening in Ithaca. It was the second year in a row that Harvard overcame a large second half deficit to beat the Big Red in the final seconds. With Aiken running the show, the Crimson stymied Cornell down the stretch, holding the hosts to two points in the contest’s final 5:09. The freshman duo combined to score or assist on nine of Harvard’s final 11 points.
ICE WATER
For the Crimson’s two most dramatic wins this season, it has been Aiken who has taken over in the final moments. Against Houston, the Randolph, N.J. native willed Harvard to victory with 13 second half points on a night when the Crimson shot 35.7 percent from the field. On Friday in Ithaca, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker wanted the ball in the freshman’s hands when his team needed a bucket.
“Obviously they’re comfortable putting the ball in my hands and I do whatever I can to get the W,” Aiken said. “Fortunately enough, the game came down to the last couple of plays and I was just blessed to be able to make shots and make the right decisions.”
Aiken silenced the home crowd several times throughout the game, burying three second-half triples immediately following Big Red baskets on the other end. One-upping his performance against the Cougars, the 6’0” point guard, had 16 points after intermission on 6-of-11 shooting. It was largely because of Aiken that the Crimson was in the game during the last few minutes, not letting the Cornell lead get to more than five in the game’s final 16-plus minutes as Harvard struggled to get stops on the defensive end for most of the second half. With the defense swarming and his team down one with under a minute to play, Aiken made his best play of the night, deferring to Bassey to give Harvard a lead it would not relinquish.
“Big time play by him,” Bassey said. “He’s a savvy point guard, he hit the shot at the end of the game, that’s why we have him and why we trust him with the ball.”

BIG TIME BASSEY
Not to be outdone by his classmate, Bassey had a flair for the dramatic as well on Friday night. While he did not have the flashy and-ones or step-back threes that Aiken did, the Denver native did the little things right during the game’s first 39 minutes before delivering one big blow that the Big Red will not soon forget. Bassey was what he has been all season—versatile and reliable—making five of his six field goal attempts and all four of his free throws while holding sophomore guard Matt Morgan, Cornell’s most dynamic offensive player, to 10 points on 3-of-8 shooting. Bassey also had four rebounds, two assists, and just one turnover in 34 minutes. Bassey has logged at least 30 minutes in four of the team’s last five games. As the Big Red can tell you, when Bassey needs to shoot, he will.
“They still trust me to take and make that shot so I think that that trust is the biggest thing for my mindset and my confidence,” Bassey said.
But Amaker can count on the freshman to give him production in many areas, whether it is guarding the team’s best perimeter player (as he has since Ivy League play began), corralling rebounds (nine against Bryant), or protecting the ball (only 10 turnovers all season). Bassey was at his best on Friday, hitting the biggest shot of his collegiate career in his biggest game thus far.
“I just really wanted to get the floor spread and get it open so that I could attack and when I did, his man helped and I kicked it to him...he hit the big three,” Aiken said.

UPDATED: January 28, 2017 at 8:30 a.m.
ITHACA, N.Y. — When Harvard and Cornell go toe to toe at Lynah Rink, there’s always a few things you can anticipate.
Like flying fish and anti-Harvard chants for instance. Both are to be expected. Maybe not chants equating members of the Crimson to “UMass rejects” like one shouted Friday night, but you get the idea.
Yet there's also developments in the rivalry you just wouldn't predict—like a Harvard team with 10 shots through two periods exploding for four final-frame tallies, hushing a previously-rocking barn of 4,267 rambunctious Big Red fans in the process.
“This atmosphere is one of the best in college hockey,” sophomore Ryan Donato said. “The crowd is always into it, and any time you get a chance to silence them, it’s a lot more fun.”
Jake Horton, Clay Anderson, Donato, and Lewis Zerter-Gossage all took turns taming the crowd over the final 20 minutes of action Friday night, catapulting the No. 9 Crimson (13-5-2, 9-4-2 ECAC) to a 4-1 victory at Lynah Rink—its second win over No. 14 Cornell (12-5-2, 7-3-2) this season.

“I don’t remember the last time we played a third period like that coming in down a goal,” co-captain Alexander Kerfoot said. “It showed a lot out of our team today. Up and down the lineup, all four lines contributing.”
Those four lines looked rather out of the ordinary on Friday, as Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 determined it was time for a change with the Crimson having won just one of its last five games. The coaching staff spared no line or defensive pairing, even subjecting its top two lines—which had not been touched all season—to upheaval.
“We just felt we weren’t really hitting on all cylinders,” Ted Donato said. “We just weren’t generating enough 5-on-5. The one fallback you have as a coach is to shake things up and move some people around.”

At first, the shake-up felt fruitless, as the new-look lineup failed to generate much for scoring opportunities, leaving Harvard down a score with 20 minutes left to play. But prior to the third, the Crimson supposedly took a look in the mirror.
“The only thing we can really control [is] how hard we work,” Kerfoot said. “It’s not acceptable to be losing games because you’re not working hard enough, so we just wanted to harp on that and preach that. That’s what we were saying between the second and third. And we came out firing.”
Just 2:20 into the final period, Horton set the tone for the closing stanza, jamming his own rebound past senior goaltender Mitch Gillam on the doorstep to even the score at one.
The goal was just the third of the season for Horton, but even so, he finished a distant second for the honor of unlikeliest goal-scorer Friday. Anderson, a senior defenseman, received that distinction, notching his first conversion of the season at 8:29 when his soft blast from the point skipped in off the skate of Cornell associate captain Patrick McCarron, who initially had his back to the puck near his goalie's left post.

Anderson led the high-five procession down the Harvard bench, but the referees initially ruled no goal on the ice.  A review would reverse the call, but Donato remained visibly unhappy nonetheless. Prior to the stoppage, all the momentum had belonged to the visitors, and suddenly the Big Red had effectively been granted what he considered “an extended timeout.”
Suddenly trailing, 2-1, in its biggest home game of the season, Cornell took advantage of its chance to regroup. Already having scored the hosts' first goal during the middle frame, junior Alex Rauter took matters
into his own hands again, coming around the left wing and beating the glove of
junior goaltender Merrick Madsen.

But it wasn’t meant to be. “GOAL” flashed on the scoreboard behind the Crimson net, and the hands of every fan in the surrounding area shot up, but the lefty’s slapper from behind the dot clanged off the inside of the far post and remained out.
Beyond the Rauter chance, the final stanza belonged almost entirely to the visitors, who outshot the Big Red, 14-6, in the frame. Harvard's one-goal lead lasted eight minutes before Ryan Donato and senior Luke Esposito—playing together on the second line for the first time this season—dealt Cornell the biggest blow of the night with 3:22 remaining.

In transition, Esposito saucered what Ryan Donato called “an unbelievable pass” through two defensemen in the slot over to the sophomore, who went forehand-backhand atop the paint to double the Crimson lead. Zerter-Gossage added an empty-netter with nine seconds remaining to finish the job.
“I liked the perseverance of the group,” Ted Donato said. “I like the fact they were able to beat a very good team that’s been as hot as anybody in the country over the last two months in a tough place to play. I thought it was a real character win for our team.”
With the exception of Zerter-Gossage’s empty-netter, Harvard scored all of its goals 5-on-5, giving Ted Donato exactly what he claimed to be looking for from his offense. But it did take a while for the Crimson to get going.
In fact, while the opening two periods featured an electric atmosphere with no shortage of intensity, the shot count remained low for both teams, and the only puck to cross the line was merely the result of a defensive breakdown. Madsen tried to leave the puck behind the net for junior defenseman Wiley Sherman, but Rauter swept in, stole possession, and completed a wrap-around to open the scoring 4:22 into the second.
Yet Harvard’s third-period explosion gave the Crimson everything it had been seeking: a bump in the PairWise rankings, an increased cushion in the ECAC’s ‘first-round bye zone,’ and not to be outdone, a second consecutive win at Lynah Rink.
“It was pretty special to win here both this year and last year,” Kerfoot said. “You remember these moments for a long time. You hate the crowd when you’re playing and when they get up on you, but in the long run, this is great for college hockey, it’s great for Cornell, and we love to play here.”
GAME NOTES
—Among Harvard's many forward changes, Kerfoot moved to left wing on the first line, Donato moved to center on the second line, and senior Tyler Moy moved to center on the third line. Sean Malone and Nathan Krusko joined Kerfoot on the Crimson's top unit.
"When you play with the same guys for a while, you can fall into a little bit of a lapse," Kerfoot said. "I think this kind of freshened everyone up.... I don’t know if these [lines] are going to be long term, but I mean if we keep playing, well, it doesn’t really matter."
—On the defensive end, Harvard tried out a veteran pairing of junior Wiley Sherman and senior Clay Anderson along with two freshman-sophomore pairs (Adam Fox and Viktor Dombrovskiy, John Marino and Jacob Olson).
—Special teams were hardly a factor on Friday, as Harvard's top-ranked power-play finished 0-for-1 against Cornell's second-ranked kill. Similarly, the Big Red power play finished 0-for-2.
—Harvard outshot the Big Red, 24-20, for the game.
—Harvard has jumped from 13th to ninth in the PairWise rankings.

New term, same food. If we’re honest, our lives revolve around HUDS: What’s on today’s menu? What are the latest dining hall hacks? And the question on everyone’s mind: if your friends were HUDS foods, what exactly would they be?
The soft serve friend:
This person is your go-to, reliable dessert after a long day of psetting. They can be counted on when the meal is bad. Take an evening off and ask them to hang out. They won’t bail on you, and you’re sure to have a good time.
The sweet potato fries friend:
This person is that best friend who you don’t get to see that often, probably because they are in high demand. But when you see on Harvard Today that they are on the lunch menu, your morning instantly becomes bearable. It's kind of alright that you don't see them frequently, because you know that when they resurface they'll be just as amazing as your remember them being.
The Cracklin’ Oat Bran friend:
This person looks like a healthy multi-grain breakfast item, but they are actually a cookie with little to no nutritional value. Don’t believe them when they say they’ve finished next week’s essay and got ten hours of sleep last night because they most likely stayed up all night doing today’s work and covered up their sleep deprivation with coffee.
The salad bar friend:
This person is everything to everyone. You pick what you like from them and leave what you don’t like, and they are happy to personalize for you. Definitely make an effort to dig deeper to learn more about their true character. No one can be everyone's friend.
The chocolate syrup friend:
This person is underrated and incognito (do you even know where to find the chocolate syrup in your dining hall?) but they can really add an extra dimension to any food item. Don’t let them hide in the "back fridge" of your friend group—bring them along to add some excitement to a boring trip to The Coop.
So which friend are you? Pro-tip to enliven any awkward Annenberg conversation: ask for a HUDS food to describe their personality, or assign them one yourself. Just don't describe them as the "catch of the day," because that will definitely lead to social disaster.
