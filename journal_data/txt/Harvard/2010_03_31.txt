After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The separation between science and human values,” argued Sam Harris last month at the 2010 TED Conference, “is an illusion.” Although a myriad of philosophers believe that moral statements cannot be proven through facts alone, Harris asserted that through science we can indeed deem some actions as more objectively moral than others. Last week, in a discussion with her husband Steven Pinker at the Harvard Hillel, novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein also attempted to bridge the “is-ought gap.” It is reason alone, Goldstein claimed, that necessarily binds us to refrain from hurting others if we expect them to refrain from hurting us.
In a column last month on his New York Times blog, Stanley Fish takes the exact opposite approach. In his review of Steven Smith’s “The Disenchantment of Secular Discourse,” Fish expounds the ineffectiveness of “secular reasons” in justifying political or moral decisions. “While secular discourse,” asserts Fish, can “amass scores of data,” it is unable to tell us what to do with that data. In other words, Fish claims, it is utterly impossible to make value judgments without religious principles.
Both sides in this debate, however, are equally erroneous. There is indeed a logical chasm between what “is” and what “ought” to be that cannot be breached by reason or science, but this does not mean that one must be religious to believe in moral truths.
Values can be reduced to facts, Harris asserts, because all worldly value systems are predicated on fostering the development of “human flourishing.” Just as we know, objectively, what constitutes human health as opposed to sickness, and just as we all strive for health and avoid illness, we can know, factually, what contributes to human flourishing and what does not. It therefore behooves us to make only those decisions that would “maximiz[e] human flourishing.”
Goldstein’s attempt to derive morality from reality is different. If she were sunbathing on a beach, Goldstein would excoriate a heavy-set male for stepping right on top of her. Now, if she truly believes that others ought to refrain from harming her, then she has one of two options. Either she should remain unharmed because she alone occupies a special place in the universe or because it is inherently wrong to harm someone else. Since the former is clearly absurd, if she genuinely expects others to abstain from causing her suffering, she is logically bound to do unto others as she would have others do unto her.
These attempts at bridging the “is-ought” gap, however, fail miserably. Harris’s approach is nothing more than a dressed-up version of utilitarianism, save for substituting “human flourishing” for “happiness.” It is impossible to prove scientifically that we are morally obligated to maximize human well-being, and even asserting that we are leaves Harris defenseless against hypotheticals such as if it were calculated that the world would objectively contain more human flourishing if it lacked Jews, gypsies, and homosexuals. Similarly, Goldstein’s approach falters because it assumes that people have a moral obligation to be logically consistent. That is, logic might impel me to abstain from hurting other people if I reasonably expect them not to hurt me, but there is no way of proving that I ought always act rationally.
Perhaps more importantly, however, the failure of reason and science to impart us with moral principles does not make belief in a divine lawgiver a more rational alternative. While Fish decries the inability of “secular reasons” to provide us with moral truth, he fails to explain why religious reasons are any better. His logic leads one directly back to the Euthyphro dilemma—is it good because God commanded it, or did God command it because it is good? That is, according to Fish’s logic, either morality is arbitrary, or there is a normative morality outside of God, independent of His existence.
Rather, it seems that Fish overextends the definition of “religious reasons” to include reasons that many would consider secular—namely, reasons that are based on an unprovable “metaphysical commitment.” But while all religious principles are metaphysical, not all metaphysical principles are religious. That is, we all make rationally unjustified leaps of faith in our beliefs, be they the belief that causation exists or that there is a world outside of our minds. The point is that not all of these leaps of faith are equal. It may not be such a stretch to say that other people exist, but it’s harder to believe that half of them are Martians. The question is where moral truths lie on this spectrum of believability, and it’s far from evident that God’s existence is either greater than or equal to the possibility that moral truths do, in fact, exist.
Atheists like Harris and Goldstein, therefore, should not pretend as though they do not inherently take a leap of faith from “is” to “ought,” because theists like Fish have no right to claim that they are religious for doing so. Indeed, although the separation between science and human values may not be an illusion, asserting that those who believe in these human values are necessarily theistic propagates one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the U.S., South Asians have risen to become leaders in their communities, industries, and government, forging a unique and proud identity in the American landscape. This can sometimes create the illusion that there are no problems in our immigrant community. In reality, South Asians in America face a variety of challenges that we must confront, and one of the most important is the widespread prevalence of domestic abuse in our households. A product of a variety of cultural and societal factors, it is a problem that is shameful and dangerous to ignore.
The problem of domestic abuse in the South Asian community has been studied on a few occasions with striking results. When the Asian Task Force against Domestic Violence (ATASK) conducted a study in Massachusetts in 2000, it found that “44 percent of South Asians know a woman who has been physically abused or injured by her partner,” and “31 percent know a woman whose partner insults or humiliates her regularly.” Professors Anita Raj of Boston University and Jay Silverman of the Harvard School of Public Health published a study in 2002 that found similarly disturbing results: When a sample of South Asian women in Boston were surveyed, 40 percent of them had experienced physical or sexual abuse in their current relationship, but only 11 percent went to seek outside help for their problems. Studies on this issue have not yet been performed on a larger scale, but the results from Massachusetts, a state with a thriving South Asian community, are indicative of a larger and worrisome reality across the nation’s South Asian households.
The reasons for this problem are rarely discussed among South Asians because it forces us to confront some of the more difficult truths about our culture. When ATASK conducted its study, it also convened focus groups that discussed the possible reasons for domestic violence in the community. The phenomena that they cited are all too common for many South Asian households. They include the idea that a woman is “given” to the husband’s family when she is married, becoming the property of her husband, which creates a culture in which it is taboo for a woman to go outside the family for help. Women are often apprehensive about discussing problems or reaching out for help because of the stigma that the culture associates with divorce and separation. A great deal of importance is put on the idea of loyalty to one’s husband and family and toughing out difficult family lives, but these “values” are all too often used as rationalizations for maintaining unhealthy domestic situations.
Highlighting these elements of the culture is not a criticism of the entirety of South Asian immigrant culture; all cultures have a darker side. And studies specifically demonstrate that the problem is not related to cultural practices such as arranged marriage but the idea of the woman as property. The main takeaway from these stigmas and cultural issues is that South Asians must fight the problem by taking a culturally specific approach to change ideas about gender roles in our households, neighborhoods, and communities.
Many nonprofit organizations have recently arisen to do exactly that. Apna Ghar (in Hindi, “our home”), is a nonprofit in the Midwest that has a hotline and a shelter specifically geared towards South Asian immigrant women, with social workers who understand the stigmas and cultural issues that bring about such situations. Apna Ghar is able to relate to the experiences of women in the South Asian immigrant community, and works with women (and often their children) on a case-by-case basis to rebuild their lives after incidents of domestic violence. The organization has also brought widespread attention to this problem, gaining praise from local corporations, governments, and then-Senator Barack Obama. Many other South Asian nonprofits, including ATASK and Saheli in Boston, are effectively addressing the issue using similar missions and methods.
Young members and friends of the South Asian community can take a unique leadership role in confronting this challenge. We can volunteer to help victims of domestic violence and support the organizations in need. Most importantly, we can raise awareness about domestic violence in our community. By discussing the issue with our families, neighborhoods, and religious organizations, we can make it clear that our generation does not believe that domestic violence is ever acceptable, and that seeking help for this issue is necessary. We must make the idea that women must be treated as equals an essential tenet of our community and that the liberty to lead life without intimidation is a basic right, not a luxury. This week, the Harvard South Asian Men’s Collective is helping to support the Apna Ghar shelter and raise awareness about domestic violence in the South Asian community. We encourage the Harvard community to join us in confronting this issue and break the silence about this disturbing problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just four teams left in the 2010 NCAA men’s basketball tournament, leading into this weekend’s festivities many seniors are preparing for their last shot at glory—but they are not alone. One of the newest and most depressing trends in college basketball has been the “one and done,” which no longer means a team losing their first game of a tournament, but rather a star player leaving college after his freshman season. Although this pattern is recent, the list of players that have already successfully made this jump include high-profile professionals such as Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, and Greg Oden.
The catalyst for the number of players jumping ship after freshman year was a 2006 change in NBA eligibility rules that prevents players from entering the draft until a full year after they graduate high school. Although the outcome of this decision was nebulous to coaches and players alike at the time of its announcement, enough time has passed now to gauge the rule’s repercussions. For the prodigious high school players that used to go directly to the NBA, like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, the route to the pros now involves an obligatory one-year stop in college. Superficially it would seem that some time in school is better than none at all. However, the “academic” trip these players take for one year devalues the traditional four-year American university education even more than them skipping college entirely would.
Presumably the NCAA, the governing body of U.S. intercollegiate athletics, prides itself on the emphasis of student in the student-athlete, with advertising campaigns, graduation rate statistics, and online guides. However, in practicality they go directly against those practices. Widely seen Final Four tournament television coverage is frequently given to stars who will be packing their bags after just one season. This spotlight makes it blaringly clear how little value is put on being a student, when in these cases only one quarter of the college commitment is finished. These “students” send the message to high-schoolers that treating college as a one-year stepping stone to a pro sports team is okay. This trend reduces high-profile student-athletes to athletes alone; the college jersey might as well reading “pre-professional.”
Of course these cases are still far more the exception than the rule; seniors this year like Jon Scheyer of Duke and Willie Veasley of Butler represent the many four-year students playing at an extremely high level while earning their degrees. The danger here is not necessarily the number of players opting out of college after one season but rather the cultural normalcy that comes along with it.
The question of how to stymie this movement is complicated. Although colleges are in part to blame for accepting athletic prodigies with the knowledge that they will leave after one year—taking them for athletic success and not academic potential—they are not the root of this issue. As backward as it may sound, the NBA should re-allow players to enter the league directly from high school. Rather than letting the small number of high-profile players publicly act as college students for a year and thus set an example to young fans that college is a one-year stop, let them go directly to the professional careers that lie ahead of them already. The student-athlete has a rich history in the country and is still actualized for thousands. It’s crucial that that remain the case for college’s stars as well as the regulars. Let’s hope the freshmen this weekend who don’t lift the trophy get three more chances at winning it all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Blockbusters like Good Will Hunting and Legally Blonde and books like “Privilege,” by Ross G. Douthat ’02, cater to broad public curiosity about what it is actually like to be a Harvard student. Whether factual or just fictitiously fun, it seems that any explanation as to what really happens behind the University’s nearly 400 year-old walls can grab at least some attention. But when the spotlight shines on Harvard’s tepid historical exclusivity and even its more meritocratic modern-day place in America, it often fans the flames of scorn that burn under our ivory tower.
There is, however, hope for change. The administration’s recent decision to begin offering free podcasts and lecture videos through Apple Inc.’s iTunes Store is an admirable step toward opening up Harvard’s unusually tight gates and giving the public a window through which to peer. Though iTunes is not entirely inclusive—meaning Harvard should also make an increased effort to reach out to the local community—Harvard’s use of iTunes will immediately help the University fulfill its duty to disperse knowledge and information not only among its students but also among the public as a whole.
Over the past decade, the spread of broadband Internet has revolutionized academic information delivery and made it far more accessible for those outside the ivory tower. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered the movement with its OpenCourseWare initiative, which has since spread to many other universities. Popular lecture videos and course documents from some of the best academic institutions can now be consumed free of charge by the world’s most eager learners at only the click of a mouse.
Various Harvard professors and schools have until now individually made lectures available across the Internet. Of particular note is the Harvard Extension School, which has already been a part of iTunes U, the iTunes Store’s one-stop academic shop for university multimedia, for over a year; it offers a handful of computer science courses free of charge. Several Harvard graduate schools also publish public course material online. The official Harvard YouTube channel offers a few courses from the College, including David Malan’s popular Computer Science 50.
And yet Harvard University as a whole has been somewhat slower than its peer institutions at offering open courses in any organized way. MIT started offering open courses in 2002 and now has over 1900 courses on offer. Yale jumped onboard with its own website in 2007 and now offers 25 full courses. Both schools also participate in iTunes U.
The Harvard University section of iTunes U, on the other hand, went live last week with only one course—Justice, Michael Sandel’s extremely popular class on everyday morality—that had already been offered free of charge on the course’s public website. While the Harvard section also prominently features podcasts from different Harvard Schools and videos dedicated to exploring life on campus, it clearly lags behind other universities’ sections.
Although Harvard’s initial entry to iTunes may be somewhat less than groundbreaking, the administration’s commitment to an organized, centralized framework wherein more courses can be quickly added gives us hope that there is monumental potential for Harvard to easily and greatly augment its public offerings.
Yet the burden to realize that potential and share Harvard with the world lies with professors as much as it does with the administration. For some professors used to selling their intellectual property as expensive textbooks or through established distance learning programs like The Teaching Company, where full sets of course videos can sell for up to $800, the thought of giving away lectures for free may not be a pleasant one. The University ought to encourage such professors to abandon this limited and profit-seeking form of thinking.
The proliferation of free content from schools like Harvard may also alarm the many students who pay to attend, often at great financial inconvenience. After all, just this month, Harvard announced that the cost of tuition, room, and board will break the $50,000 barrier next year. Yet, though ironic in the face of increasing tuition, free academic content is not offered at the expense of students and in no way cheapens the value of a certified Harvard education. Students here and at other universities have direct and interactive access to libraries, educators, and each other, all of which are an irreplaceable part of a complete education. As such, students’ concerns should not hold the University back from providing lectures to those who do not pay tuition.
Moreover, personal access to lecture on iTunes can benefit students, too. As the popular event Harvard Thinks Big showed, students are often interested in courses that do not fit into their schedules. While many classes already make lecture videos available to students via Harvard iSites, being able to easily download and sync the videos using the familiar iTunes interface will add a layer of convenience that works to meet the on-campus demand for lecture videos.
So, Harvard students, whether you’re down the street or across the world, the next time someone asks you about life in Cambridge, you might do well to simply direct your iPods to itunes.harvard.edu.

The halt in construction on the Allston Science Complex late last year left plans for two of Harvard’s science schools to expand into the new campus in limbo, as school officials struggle to adjust to the now indefinite space constraints of the current campus.
Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health both expected several departments to move into the new complex by the original 2011 completion date, but are now taking steps to accommodate growing programs by moving labs and leasing new property with little guidance from the University’s central administration.
“Our response is to rejigger all of our space to accommodate what was going to go into the first building [in Allston],” Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier said in an interview last week. “Our departments are our departments, and we’re responsible for them.”
According to Flier, who also sits on the task force examining the University’s strategy going forward in Allston, there is little guidance the central administration can provide until a concrete long-term plan has been devised at the schools.
But University officials said yesterday they remain cognizant of the graduate schools’ expansion plans.
“The future space needs of our professional schools, as well as of the FAS, are part and parcel of our increasingly integrated capital planning process, which encompasses Cambridge, Allston, and Longwood,” wrote Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp in an e-mailed statement.
Flier said that the Medical School owns property where departments could move. But relocating departments to those buildings would require foregoing rent revenue from tenants who currently lease the space at a time the school is expected to make further cuts to its $560 million budget.
The groups affected at the Medical School include bioengineering researchers, stem cell scientists, and the department of systems biology—which currently has sufficient space but needs to relocate to allow for expected growth over the next decade.
According to Timothy Mitchison, deputy chair of systems biology, the department cannot accommodate any additional faculty members in its current building.
“We had an aggressive hiring plan,” Mitchison said, referring to the period before last year’s recession. “Most people have accepted that the growth of the department would slow a little bit. That takes pressure off the space.”
The School of Public Health faces a similar challenge—its current facilities are inadequate for its growing faculty and student body.
“We’re trying to decide what’s a responsible investment,” said David J. Hunter, the school’s dean for academic affairs, in an interview earlier this year.
But current efforts to make better use of the University’s property holdings have led some to question the original need for the Allston science building, especially as Harvard has already constructed two large laboratory buildings over the past decade—The New Research Building in Longwood and the Northwest Science Building in Cambridge.
“Looking back on Allston... the mentality seemed to be ‘if you build it, they will come,’ and maybe we’ve in some sense moved back to a more rational plan,” Mitchison said.

Former Dean of the Harvard School of Public Health Barry R. Bloom noticed in 2001 that he had “virtually no money in the richest university in the world to do all kinds of new interesting things [he had] wanted to do.”
Bloom and his administration then took steps to revise stipulations on future grants and donations to allow the creation of reserve funds that have grown large enough over the past few years for the school to avoid severe cutbacks in the wake of the economic recession.
The School of Public Health encouraged donors and grant applicants to factor in the indirect costs of research—including not insubstantial expenses such as heating and electricity—which cut back on expenditures paid for by the school itself.
According to the School of Public Health’s Chief Financial and Administrative Officer Laura T. Ketchum, payout from the University endowment accounts for only 13 percent of the school’s revenue—a smaller fraction than at any other school. Instead, the school relies primarily on federal research funding for its budget.
The creation of the reserve funds allows the School of Public Health to develop new initiatives in fields such as international or environmental health and provides a buffer against uncertainty in grant funding.
“If we needed to hire someone, if someone lost a grant, [and] there was research that we thought was promising, [but] the NIH hadn’t anticipated, we could keep this place going in exactly the same directions we thought were important on our own money,” Bloom said in an interview earlier this month.
When Julio Frenk ascended to the deanship in January 2009, he found the reserves virtually untouched since the previous years had seen a period of economic prosperity.
According to Ketchum, the funds that the school saved will now be used to fund critical priorities such as student support, faculty recruitment, new teaching and research initiatives, and infrastructure needs.
“We’re fortunate to have these reserves to be able to do this,” Ketchum wrote in an e-mail. “But, we recognize that continued prudent management means that we maintain an appropriate level of reserve balances to weather any future financial challenges.”
Though Bloom had not accounted for a major economic recession when he created the reserve funds—worrying instead that federal research funding might decline—he said he hoped that the money set aside would help the School of Public Health pull through current economic troubles.
“I was right for the wrong reason,” Bloom said. “I had no idea that the economic situation of the country [and] the University would crash, but those reserves did preserve the options for the new dean and I feel very confident that that was a good head start.”

When Colleen M. Berryessa ’11 approached the headquarters of the Harvard University Police Department, she was struck by its resemblance to the other office buildings on Mass. Ave.
Apart from the holding cell in the basement and the prevalence of security cameras, Berryessa said, “you couldn’t really tell right away that it’s a police department.”
Berryessa and six other members of the newly founded Crime Club took a two-hour tour of the HUPD headquarters on Monday, a trip designed to provide insight into the workings of Harvard’s police force.
The HUPD headquarters at 1033 Mass. Ave. also includes an in-house gym, and according to Berryessa, HUPD officers said that the facilities helped to make Harvard’s police department among the fittest of all nearby college police departments.
At the end of the tour, members of HUPD presented statistics and explanations of how their policies have changed over time in a question and answer session.
Berryessa said that she was surprised to learn that 13 officers—or roughly 10 percent of HUPD, according to Katherine M. Obst ’12, another member of the club who went on the tour—were female, since she had not seen a female HUPD officer on campus before.
The visit also made HUPD less intimidating in her mind, Berryessa said, adding that Harvard students should try to get to know their campus police force.
“It’s not like if you see a HUPD officer and you are like, ‘Oh my god, what’s wrong,’” Berryessa said, “It’s like, ‘Hey! Jim!’”
The Crime Club was founded in January but has not been granted official recognition by the College at this time. According to Berryessa, the organization aims to provide an outlet for students interested in criminal justice, law enforcement, and criminology to discuss relevant issues.
Katherine A. O’Leary ’11, a member of the Crime Club, said that she joined the group as she is interested in the application of science in law enforcement. Though she missed the visit to the HUPD headquarters, she said she viewed such events as useful opportunities to further explore her interest in law enforcement.
So far, the Crime Club has attracted 55 members on Facebook and about 40 e-mail list subscribers, Berryessa said.

Financial aid officials from nearby universities hailed President Barack Obama’s signing of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 yesterday as landmark legislation that could bring changes to financial aid programs at institutions of higher education across the country.
The reform of the federal financial aid program sends a “very powerful public policy message,” said Harvard College Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue.
“I certainly think that we as a nation should be investing even more dollars in our federal financial aid program,” Donahue said. “Access to education is critically important to our nation.”
The legislation includes the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which will provide an expanded government direct-lending program and eliminate the role of private financial institutions as intermediaries in providing student loans, saving an estimated $68 billion over 11 years.
MIT Director of Student Financial Services Elizabeth M. Hicks said SAFRA—which she referred to as a “landmark legislation for the Obama administration” and a “real victory for education”—would bring about an “overdue” reform of the federal financial aid system.
The act also allocates an additional $36 billion to expand the Federal Pell Grant Program—a need-based federal financial aid program that provides assistance for students from low-income families—over the next 10 years.
According to Donahue, even though Harvard’s financial aid program is able to meet the full need for all students without loans, the increase in Pell Grants—which amount to approximately 3 percent of Harvard’s grants—will be beneficial.
The legislation also contains provisions to change income-based repayment plans.
For loans taken out after July 1, 2004, the legislation will reduce the share of income a graduate must devote to loan payments from 15 to 10 percent, and the loan forgiveness period from 25 to 20 years.
These changes will impact Harvard undergrads who go on to attend graduate schools and influence their decisions in choosing career paths, Donahue said.
But Tufts Director of Financial Aid and Co-Manager of Student Financial Services Patricia Reilly predicted that the overhaul will have “very little benefit for students,” according to an article in the Tufts Daily.
“The loans are the same; the terms and conditions are the same. It’s an administrative project for the school,” Reilly said in the article.

Graduate School of Design professor Michael Van Valkenburgh—who specializes in landscape architecture—will be honored this coming May with the American Academy of Arts and Letters’s 2010 Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture.
Van Valkenburgh is the only living GSD Landscape Architecture professor to have received this award, which is rarely awarded to a landscape architect.
Van Valkenburgh’s work has included landscape designs for Pennsylvania Avenue, the American Museum of Natural History, and Cornell and Princeton Universities. He has also spearheaded efforts to restore Harvard Yard over the past twenty years.
Most recently, Van Valkenburgh designed the newly opened Brooklyn Bridge Park at Pier 1 in New York City, which Ethan Carr, an associate professor of landscape history at the University of Virginia, said will likely be one of the “most successful of this new generation of municipal park projects.”
Hugh Hardy, a member of the committee that awards the Brunner Prize, said the committee selected Van Valkenburgh for his contribution to public life.
“He has really done some wonderful things in urban environments,” Hardy said.
New York City Department of Parks and Recreation Commissioner Adrian Benepe said that Van Valkenburgh is “passionate about his work and passionate about the importance of well-designed public space for a liveable city.”
Van Valkenburgh has been a member of the faculty at the School of Design since 1982, serving as program director from 1987 to 1989 and chairman of the landscape architecture department from 1991 to 1996. He is also the lead principal for Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Inc., which has offices in Cambridge and New York.
Van Valkenburgh described his creative process as “some place midstream between the mode of inquiry and research that a scientist uses and the poetic and deeply intuitive instincts of a painter or sculptor.”
Gary R. Hilderbrand, an adjunct professor at the GSD who has worked with Van Valkenburgh for the past twenty years, said that Van Valkenburgh has “design leadership of a rare kind.”
“Whether it’s wind, sound, or reflection, or wildness, I think that Michael’s work focuses mainly on qualities of landscape and by exaggerating or by emphasizing, he brings them forward so that people see them in a way they had never seen them before,” Hilderbrand said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 31, 2010
An earlier verison of the Mar. 31 news article "Graduate School of Design Prof. Awarded Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture" incorrectly stated that Graduate School of Design professor Michael Van Valkenburgh is the only living GSD professor to have received the American Academy of Arts and Letters’s 2010 Arnold W. Brunner Memorial Prize in Architecture. In fact, Van Valkenburgh is the only living GSD Landscape Architecture professor to have received this award.

Three winners of this year’s Lukas Prize Project Awards were recognized yesterday for their outstanding work in nonfiction writing, the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard and Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism announced yesterday.
David L. Finkel will receive the J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize—named for two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner J. Anthony Lukas ’55—for “The Good Soliders,” a book on a battalion of infantry soldiers in the Iraq war, at a ceremony at the Nieman Foundation on May 4,
The Mark Lynton History Prize will be bestowed upon James N. Davidson for his book “The Greeks and Greek Love: A Bold New Exploration of the Ancient World,” which explores homoeroticism in ancient Greece.
Finkel and Davidson will each receive a $10,000 prize.
Journalist Jonathan Schuppe was named the winner of the J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award, which provides a $30,000 award to help the recipient complete a nonfiction project.
Schuppe is working on a nonfiction narrative entitled “Ghetto Ball: A Coach, His Team, and the Struggle of an American City,” which focuses on a Little League baseball team in inner-city Newark coached by a paraplegic former drug dealer.
Schuppe said yesterday that dividing his time between a paying job and the in-person reporting that his book requires has been difficult.
“This award literally buys me several months of intensive reporting and writing,” he said. “Without it, I’m not sure what I would be doing.”
Lukas, the awards’ namesake, served as associate managing editor of The Crimson, and returned to Harvard as a Nieman Fellow in 1969 after winning his first Pulitzer Prize for “The Two Worlds of Linda Fitzpatrick,” an article in The New York Times about the life and death of an affluent teenager involved in the 1960s hippie and drug culture.
In 1986, he earned a second Pulitzer for his book about the racial turmoil surrounding school busing in Boston, entitled “Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families.”
After Lukas’s suicide in 1997, his widow Linda Healy and friends created the Lukas Prize Project Awards in his memory.
Finkel said that he was especially gratified to learn that had received the accolade since “[Lukas’] work was really important in the kind of reporter I’ve become.”
While working as a reporter in distant locales such as Yemen and Iraq, Finkel said he always carried a few books with him, one of which was “Common Ground.”
The prizes are funded by the family of writer Mark Lynton, who also passed away in 1997.

Students interested in how the dining halls prepare butternut squash and country fried steak can now sign up for behind-the-scenes tours of the Mather-Dunster kitchen.
Each tour is limited to 15 people and provides undergraduates a look at the Mather-Dunster kitchen, which connects the two Houses.
During the tour, students were given candid answers to questions about the tunnel network connecting House kitchens, resource allocation, and the planning that goes into each meal.
Participants observed the conveyor belts that deliver the used plates to the kitchen, the area where the food is actually prepared, and the machines used to process and filter the water that Harvard University Dining Services uses.
Mather and Dunster dining halls were the last House dining halls to be renovated as part of a residential dining hall renovation initiative that ended in 2005.
“I thought it was interesting how much of a sense of history there is here, especially with regards to the renovations,” said Ram Sachs, a sophomore at Stanford who was visiting Harvard on his spring break.
The tours are open to students outside of Mather and are part of the HUDS’ Food Literacy Project, a collaborative effort between the Harvard School of Public Health, University Health Services, and HUDS.
The project’s mission, according to HUDS’ website, is to “[cultivate] an understanding of food from the ground up” by educating students about food preparation, agriculture, nutrition, and the HUDS community.
Tour participants expressed gratitude and excitement about what they had learned.
“I loved how much they listen to us,” Kristen Logan ’12, a Mather resident said. “It shows that they really care about us.”
Additional tours will be conducted on April 1 and April 23 at 3 p.m.

A record-low 6.9 percent of applicants have been accepted to the Harvard College Class of 2014.
The coveted fat envelopes will be mailed today to 2,110 students, the Office of Admissions announced earlier yesterday. Applicants will also receive their decisions via e-mail after 5 p.m. today.
Applications increased by about 5 percent this year, topping 30,000 for the first time. While the acceptance rate dropped by 0.1 percent, 64 more students received a ‘yes’ from Harvard in the initial round of decisions this year.
More than 60 percent of the accepted students are eligible to receive need-based financial aid from Harvard, with the average award totaling $40,000. Although some students’ financial aid applications are still incomplete or subject to change, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that “there will almost certainly be a record percentage on financial aid.”
Next year’s financial aid budget will reach a new high of $158 million.
This year’s accepted class contains slightly more students who self-identify as Asian-American and African-American—18.2 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively—while the portion of students that identifies as Latino dropped marginally, from 10.6 percent last year to 10.3 percent this year.
The percentage of Native Americans in the admitted class saw the sharpest increase, jumping from 1.1 percent last year to 2.7 percent this year.
Fitzsimmons attributed the surge in Native American acceptances to two new efforts of the Harvard University Native American Program—a recruiting tour aimed at Native American students organized in conjunction with several other universities, and phone calls made by HUNAP to promising Native American high school students.
Admitted students hail from 79 countries, and international students comprise 9 percent of the class.
Drawn from an applicant pool that was 50.9 percent male, the admitted class is 52.4 percent male. A majority of last year’s admittees were male as well, but that entering class ultimately contained more women than men, since more women chose to accept the offer of admission.
Fitzsimmons said the growing reputation of Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences caused more students to apply to Harvard this year, and 12.2 percent of the admitted students listed engineering as their intended concentration—up 2 percent from last year.
Roughly one-fourth of admitted students claimed an interest in the humanities—a 2.7 percent increase—while those planning to study the social sciences dropped from 24.6 percent last year to 21.3 percent this year.
Admitted students will receive invitations to visit campus from April 24 to 26. The admissions office predicts that 1,100 prospective students will participate in the April Visiting Program and another 200 will visit campus during the rest of the month.
Students may also be contacted via telephone by faculty, admissions and financial aid staff, and members of the Undergraduate Admissions Council, Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, and Harvard Financial Aid Office over the next month as they evaluate their offers of admission.
An undisclosed number of students will be sent letters today telling them that they have been wait-listed. Fitzsimmons said that “we hope very much to take a substantial number” of students off the waitlist in May and June.
Fitzsimmons urged these students to provide the admissions office with additional information for the upcoming round of waitlist deliberations.
“If something good has happened to them since they applied, we would love to hear about it...from them and maybe from their counselors and teachers,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Ivy League, winter has officially ended, as the three teams left dancing in their NCAA Tournaments—Yale and Cornell men’s hockey and the Big Red men’s basketball —all bowed out last weekend. So now, we at The Back Page can turn our attention to the spring season, with renewed rivalries, national powerhouses, and rainouts. Lots and lots of rainouts.
Let’s take a quick look around the Ivies.
MEN’S LACROSSE
Two weeks into Ivy play, the men’s lacrosse standings look just as predicted. Powerhouses Cornell and Princeton sit atop the standings with identical 2-0 records, Brown is third at 1-0, and Harvard is in the middle of the pack at 1-1.
The Crimson takes a break from the Ancient Eight this weekend, hosting Duke in Friday’s night game, but a pair of unbeatens—the Tigers and Bears (oh my!)—will clash at Gillette Stadium as part of the New England Lacrosse Classic on Saturday. The Big Red and Dartmouth will also tangle in Foxborough, while the Bulldogs and Penn, both winless in Ivy play, meet in New Haven.
WOMEN’S LACROSSE
With four games left in conference play, a narrow 11-10 loss to Brown on Saturday has put Harvard women’s lacrosse in a four-way tie for fourth place. The Crimson is headed to rival Yale—another 1-2 Ivy team—on Saturday, and the victor gains some important ground towards making the Ivy Tournament at season’s end.
The Quakers continue to be a powerhouse, sitting sixth nationally and atop the Ancient Eight standings with a 3-0 conference record. But the Big Green, which shocked then-No. 6 Syracuse with a 17-10 win last week, has now cracked the top 10 as well, landing at No. 9 in the polls.
BASEBALL
The five-week Ivy marathon opens on Saturday, with each team playing in a pair of non-division doubleheaders. Heading into the conference season, only one squad has a winning record—the Bulldogs, sitting at 11-6-1 after going 2-1 in their weekend series with the New York Institute of Technology. Yale opens Ancient Eight play at Columbia and Penn this weekend.
Meanwhile, Harvard—currently 6-11, a vast improvement over the last two dismal preseasons—heads to Cornell and Princeton for its weekend set. The Big Red, last year’s Gehrig Division champion, dropped three of four at Army last weekend, while the Tigers lost three of four at Santa Clara.
SOFTBALL
Ancient Eight softball also heats up this weekend with the beginning of conference play, and like their male counterparts, the Crimson women come into the weekend fresh off a pair of Sunday wins. Harvard will hit the road to take on Princeton on Friday and defending Ivy champion Cornell—12-7 on the season so far—on Saturday.
Crimson co-captain Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, was named the conference Player of the Week today.
But there’s one other team in Ivy softball that boasts a winning non-conference record, and that’s the Bears, a squad that finished in the basement of the North Division a year ago. Will Brown have the juice to make noise in Ivy play? The team faces the Quakers and the Lions this weekend.

At stake this Friday night in the Harvard-Duke lacrosse game will bragging rights, national standings and...the Lowe’s Senior Class Award?
About a month ago, I wrote that senior midfielder Jason Duboe had been nominated for the award. Duboe just got one step closer to winning it yesterday when he was named one of ten finalists. The senior was a preseason All-American honorable mention and has also been named to two Tewaaraton Watch lists and the preseason All-Ivy team. Duboe was also a first team All-New England selection the past two seasons.
Also on the list is arguably the Crimson’s biggest threat this coming weekend, Blue Devils attacker Max Quinzani, a third team USILA All-American last year. Quinzani leads Duke with 43 points this season, two ahead of classmate Ned Crotty as of Tuesday afternoon. At Duxbury High School, Quinzani scored 577 goals, breaking the previous national record of 533, held by former Syracuse player Casey Powell.

Sometimes, things come better in pairs.
That was certainly the case yesterday afternoon, as Harvard (9-8) was dominant in doubles play, sweeping all three matches against Binghamton (16-1). Yet the Crimson’s dominance in doubles didn’t translate into singles play, as Harvard fell to the Bearcats, 4-3.
“[It was] our first match home after playing well on the road in the Blue-Grey classic,” Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “It was disappointing not to make a better adjustment.”
To start things off, the combo of junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and freshman Joshua Tchan easily won, 8-2, at the No. 3 doubles position. Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien and freshman Christo Schultz followed suit, winning 8-4 at the top doubles spot to clinch the doubles point.
“Doubles, I thought we had a lot of energy,” Tchan said. “We went out there without any hesitation. We got the doubles point pretty easily.”
Harvard has only dropped the doubles point in a dual match fives times on the season.
“We have very good doubles players,” Fish said. “They like playing doubles. It’s too bad we can’t get a couple more points for it.”
In the final doubles match, despite being down early, sophomore Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen rallied to tie the set up at 7-7.  The combo went on to win the tiebreak, completing the sweep for Harvard.
To kick off singles play, Tchan cruised to an easy 6-1, 6-1 victory over Alexandre Haggai at the fifth singles slot.
“[Alexandre] was an amazing athlete,” Tchan said. “I’ve had a lot of practice with Alexei lately, so I’ve been working on my attacking game, and I tried implementing that in my match today. It just went in my favor.”
“Josh played lights out,” Fish said.
Omodele-Lucien was the next to finish, falling to Moshe Levy 6-2, 6-4 at the No. 2 singles spot.
“Aba was just a little out of sync,” Fish said. “He had been playing well in the spring trip, then took some time off to get something a little healed.”
“It just wasn’t his day today,” Tchan added.
In a contest between two top players in the Northeast, Chijoff-Evans fell to Sven Vloedgraven, 6-3, 6-3.
“Those were two great players,” Fish said. “[Vloedgraven] was just tougher and refused to miss around the edges of the court. They were both just battling side to side. [Vloedgraven] was just more tenacious not to give up that edge at all.”
Shultz went on to win at the No. 6 singles slot, defeating Binghamton’s Ruben Devos 6-2, 6-4. Shultz used a big serve and fast forehand to overpower Devos from the outset of the match.
“Christo played great out there,” Fish said.
Freshman Andy Nguyen fell to Gilbert Wong 6-3, 6-4 at the No. 3 singles spot.
With the Crimson and the Bearcats tied at 3-3, all eyes turned to the decisive No. 4 singles match. Felton won the first set for Harvard at 6-4. But Arnav Jain bounced back, winning the second set 6-3, and Felton could not recover his momentum, falling in a gritty final set, 6-4.
“Ali played great for half of the match,” Fish said. “And then got a little bit confused with his game style and didn’t continue doing what had gotten him the first set. So he began to erode a little bit.”
Binghamton came into the match boasting a 6-1 record against Ivy League opponents, with Columbia being its only loss.
“We knew in the back of our heads going in that it was going to be a really tough team to play against,” Tchan said.
“Right up through the line-up we know we were in a dog fight,” Fish said. “They took it to us. Good young coach—he’s recruited a great bunch of kids, and he beat us.”
The match served as a final tune-up for the squad, which commences Ivy League play against Columbia on Friday.
“In some ways we had to use [the Binghamton match] to get the rust off,” Fish said. “[Hopefully] we polish a little more rust off, and play a little bit better on Friday.”

If you haven’t been paying attention to the Harvard’s men’s volleyball team, now would be a good time to do so.
The Crimson earned its second win in a row for the first time in the season, beating Emmanuel (26-10, 10-1 GNAC) last night at the Malkin Athletic Center. Harvard (4-12, 3-1 EIVA Hay Division) started strong in the first set and never looked back as the squad earned a 3-0 victory.
Co-captain Erik Kuld led the team with 20 kills and two service aces. Kuld was dominant on the night as he unleashed spikes from both sides of the court. The match also saw sophomore Matt Jones continue his hot streak with 14 kills for the match.
“I think we did very well tonight,” coach Brian Baise said. “We served well, we passed well, and our defense improved and that makes us just a tough team to beat.”
The start of the first set would set the tone for the match, with Harvard taking an early lead, 4-3, on a block from senior Soren Rosier. The Crimson held this lead until the score reached 12-11, but two consecutive blocks by the Saints’ Keoni Rabaino gave Emmanuel the lead for the first time since the beginning of the set.
Despite this setback, Harvard went on 12-2 run to take a commanding lead that the Saints could not overcome. Emmanuel was forced to take a timeout to regroup, but the Crimson remained dominant coming out of the break.
Rosier stepped up for Harvard when it counted and gave the squad set point. Unlike past matches, when the Crimson let early leads slip away, the team closed it out on a service error from the Saints to give the home squad the game, 30-23.
“Their team was making a lot of errors which was helping us out,” Kuld said. “But we’ve also become a bit better at closing out sets that we should win.”
Winning the first set pumped up Harvard’s energy going into the second.
The Crimson took the first three points of the second set with two massive kills from Jones. Up 11-7, Kuld stepped up to the service line and smacked the ball for an ace to extend the team’s lead to five.
Harvard maintained this five-point lead up until 24-19 after a block from Jones followed by a kill and an ace from Kuld. Emmanuel coach Chris Wright called a timeout, but just like the first set, the Crimson held strong.
With the home team within two points of taking the set, Jones spiked a ball just inside the back line to give Harvard set point, and a tip by Kuld won the set, 30-27, to earn the Crimson a commanding a two-set lead.
“Over the last four or five matches, we’ve been coming together more and playing with more confidence,” Baise said. “I think the team has matured a little bit and gotten more comfortable with each other.”
The momentum swung back and forth at the beginning of the third set, but Kuld made sure Harvard stayed in front with one of his biggest kills of the night.
On the very next point, the Crimson had luck on its side, as Rosier’s serve clipped the top of the net and landed low in the opponent’s court for an ace to give Harvard a three-point lead and some breathing room.
Again, Kuld and Jones stepped up, sparking a 14-6 run with a tip and a block for the senior and a kill from the sophomore. On match point, the Saints’ Thomas McCaffrey spiked the ball on what looked to be a sure winner, but freshman Rob Lothman was there for the block to take the final set, 30-23, giving the Crimson its second win a row.
Despite struggles at the beginning of the season, Harvard is improving with three wins in the past four matches. The Crimson looks to extend this winning streak at Newbury on Saturday.
“It feels wonderful to get the second win,” Baise said. “We waited a long time. Tonight was an indicator of the improvements we’ve made. I think it’s clear we are making some progress.”

Quick question: how often do you see women roaming the NFL sidelines? How about behind the bench at an NHL or NBA game? The answer is never. People wonder when a woman will be elected president. But if men can’t trust a woman when a game is on the line, why would they trust one with the economy?
Now if only rowing were a more mainstream sport, perceptions might begin to change because Linda Muri has proven sports knowledge is not restricted to those with Y-chromosomes.
“To me, in rowing, there’s not a lot of difference [between coaching women and men],” she said. “It’s the same rules, the same distance. It’s really the same kind of technique. I think women are just as capable of coaching men.”
Muri, the head coach of the Harvard freshman lightweights, took her top freshman boat to its first ever Intercollegiate Rowing Championships victory in 2004. That same year, her boat took first place at Eastern Sprints, the first time a Crimson freshman lightweight eight had done so since 1985. Last year, the freshman eight took second to help the lightweight squad win the team title at Eastern Sprints.
The 1986 MIT graduate has been quite successful coaching on the international stage as well. She has coached the U.S. Women’s Junior National Team four and pair to the finals of the World Championship every year she coached them.
“She’s a fantastic coach,” freshman Alex Newell said. “I have a huge amount of respect for her both as a coach as an athlete. She obviously shows a lot of care and effort not only for the 1F but also for the 2F and the 3F. She does a really great job every year.”
And Muri completely belies the assumption that women coaches won’t be tough enough on athletes.
“She definitely pushes us really hard,” Newell said. “We get a lot of people in the beginning of the year, and a lot of them leave. But we’re competing to win, and everyone understands that.”
“I do expect a lot from my team,” Muri added. “I think if I expect high standards then they’re more likely to achieve it.”
And few know more about winning than Muri, who won three world championships in the pair in nine years on the national team.
Not bad for someone who didn’t start rowing in earnest until her sophomore year at MIT after starting her college career as a field hockey player.
“I started because I lived in a small house. My house tutor and a couple of the other people invited me to join them for the intramural race,” Muri explained. “The intramural race was a mixed race and they needed two non rowers. I was one of the non rowers because I was playing field hockey at the time.”
The race prompted Muri to explore the sport, but, at first, she was uninspired.
“I went to one of the practices, and I didn’t like it so I kept playing field hockey,” she recalled. “It took another year when I decided I would give it one more shot.”
It turned out to be a good decision. In addition to Muri’s world championships, she has also won 18 U.S. national championships, six Head of the Charles Regattas, and two CRASH-B Sprints hammers. In 1994, she was a semifinalist for the James E. Sullivan Award, which recognizes the top amateur athlete in the country.
The star athlete began coaching at the Middlesex School before moving to the collegiate level with a job at Simmons College. This season will mark her ninth coaching Harvard men, something that often prompts questions from reporters and others.
“You never hear a male who’s coaching women get asked the questions I get asked about coaching men,” she said. “It’s a double standard out there.”
And yet part of the reason Muri is asked so many questions is because she seems to be such an outlier. While men who coach women’s teams are fairly common, one hardly ever hears about the roles being reversed.
Yet there is hope that Muri’s success may change perceptions. Perhaps in the future, one will see more men’s sports teams following the lead of the Crimson lightweights and hiring women as coaches.
“I think all sports are suffering because we’re missing 50 percent of the population [in the coaching pool],” she said. “I’d like to see that change. And I think all sports would improve to see more women coaching.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As first reported by the Boston Globe early Tuesday morning, men's  basketball coach Al Skinner has been let go from his position at Boston College. Skinner,  who had been at BC since 1997 and was the school's winningest men's  basketball coach, had his contract bought out last Wednesday, two days  prior to his interview at St. John's—which hired ex-UCLA coach Steve  Lavin Tuesday. Though he led his team to seven NCAA tournament  appearances in 13 years, Skinner had struggled recently, as the Eagles finished under .500 twice in the past  three seasons. According to some critics, the expectations of the ACC post were rather unrealistic.
The Ivy League figures to be a factor in filling the vacancy.
Current  Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has been rumored to be a candidate, and Jeff Goodman of  FoxSports.com recently tweeted that Cornell coach Steve Donahue will  interview for the BC position Wednesday.  Northeastern's head coach Bill Coen, who was on Skinner's staff at  BC for seven seasons, and Richmond's Chris Mooney have also been said to  be candidates for the job.
In other coaching  news, the Daily Pennsylvanian is reporting that Jerome Allen will be named Penn's  men's basketball coach. Allen has served as interim head coach since the  firing of Glen Miller Dec. 14.
Holy Cross fired men's basketball head coach Sean Kearney  Tuesday after one season.

Residents in the old River Houses now have something else to worry about besides rodents and roaches. Yesterday, numerous rooms in Kirkland, Eliot, Winthrop, and Dunster began to leak from the roof as the torrential rain hits Cambridge nonstop for two days.
In an e-mail sent to his House last night, Scott Haywood, building manager of Kirkland House, gave an explanation for why some of the rooms were leaking (other than "because it's raining").
"These leaks are not due to the roof structure but are the result of missing mortar or cracked bricks in the 94 years old chimney stacks. The blowing wind pushes water through any gaps and cracks and collects behind the face course of bricks in the chimneys," Haywood wrote.
According to Haywood, no repair work can be done until the rain stops, but, in the meantime, we may have found a novel solution!
John J. Pomeri of Dunster House told us all you need to do is give your building manager's office a call to report a leak. Building maintenance will happily supply you with a bucket until the rain goes away.
Just one more day until sunshine. Please.

Argyle clad, overly competitive, and of course snobby—this is what a typical Harvard student looks like—at least according to Brown.
The Brown University South Asian Students Association (SASA) recently produced a series of videos promoting their 2010 event, Nashaa. All three of the videos, modeled after Apple's "Mac vs. PC" commericials, feature a Brown student and a "Harvard student" having conversations about school and extra-curriculars. Here are some highlights.
In the first video, "Family Reunion," Brown and Harvard talk about a "family reunion" amongst all of the Ivy League schools. In typical Harvard manner, Harvard complains about Yale and is overly competitive. The Brown student is, of course, the relaxed, hipster stereotype, sporting a beanie and a flannel shirt. One of FlyBy's favorite lines: "Listen Harvard, you gotta calm down. We're all brothers here. And then there's Cornell..."
In video number two, "Bigger is Better," Brown and Harvard compare plans for the evening. Harvard's plans are to do work for his four classes, including "Dead White Guy Philosophy 101, Insider Trading 302," and "this graduate level seminar entitled 'Country Club Etiquette.'" (Must have missed that last one in the course guide.) The video concludes with this gem:
Brown: That's why we're not tight, Harvard. 
Harvard: Why? Because my acceptance rate is so much smaller than yours. 
Brown: Yeah, you're right. [looks down at you-know-what] Mine is bigger. 
Ouch.
The third and final video, "Gift Exchange," shows Harvard and Brown exchanging gifts. In true Harvard fashion, Harvard gives Brown a framed picture of himself, and Brown retaliates by giving Harvard a t-shirt reading, "Harvard. Because not everyone can get into Brown." Cute. Also, we've never heard that one before....
You might cringe slightly at the unoriginality of these video, but hey at least it's not as bad as this video.

On Tuesday evening at about 6 p.m., Yale University junior Cameron Dabaghi, an East Asian studies major from Austin, Texas, took his life by jumping from the top of the observation deck of the Empire State Building in New York City.
The Yale Daily News reported that Dubaghi's body was found by rescue workers on 34th street at about 6:15 p.m., according to the New York City Police Department.
Dubhagi's sister, Andrene Dabaghi, is also a Yale University student.
According to the YDN, the university said that it will be extending support to Dabaghi's friends and family members and making counselors available to all Yale students.
Paul J. Barreira, director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling for University Health Services at Harvard, said that UHS will be making a stronger effort to coordinate with residential life staff and student mental health groups to make sure that every student is "more alert and mindful" in the aftermath of this suicide and the recent Cornell suicides.

In the spirit of awards season, Harvard will be rolling out its very own carpet as it hosts an award ceremony—but this time, the carpet is in a peculiar shade of green.
The first annual Green Carpet Awards, to be held in Sanders on Apr. 23, aims to recognize both students and faculty who have done exceptional work in green projects and initiatives.
According to freshman Resource Efficiency Program representative Isabella A. Wechsler '13, “The awards were designed by the Office for Sustainability here at Harvard. They want to recognize people on campus who have made some kind of contribution this year in the area of sustainability, whether it be a type of infrastructure or student outreach.”
For the eco-friendly students and staff that have made the biggest impact, there is a wide array of awards available. Five different awards are given to teams and individuals may receive one of 50 total Individual Achievement Awards.
For the technology-savvy, there is also a Green Video contest. The winner, according to advertisements, will receive an impressive $700 in prize money—plenty of cash to spend on a shopping spree, in the Square, or even on late-night coffee (but only with recyclable cups) in Lamont Café.
Ultimately, the awards aim to shine a spotlight on the Harvardians most dedicated to sustainability and reduction of carbon emissions—an important cause considering the growing concern over global warming. These people, according to Freshman REP member Anne M. Baldwin '13, “would otherwise not be recognized.”
To highlight the importance of the event, the Office for Sustainability is pulling out the big guns. “They’re trying to get Drew Faust to be there,” explained Baldwin.
Now, if our very own President can find free time to trek down the green carpet and honor the sustainability cause, then you can surely do the same. At 3 p.m. on Apr. 23, check out the awards and stick around afterwards for a reception in the Queen’s Head Pub. “It’s a pretty big deal,” concluded Baldwin.
