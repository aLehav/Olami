After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As of today, I’ve spent my last weekend in the woods as an Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps cadet, taking another large step closer to commissioning as a U.S. Army second lieutenant next month. I am certainly excited and honored to be charged with the privilege of leading American soldiers, but I would be lying if I didn’t also acknowledge a few hesitations and worries about entering the profession of arms.
Along with many of my commissioning peers, I am wrestling with the fear that I will be an inadequate or insufficient leader who cannot earn the respect of her soldiers. No one is going to care much about the “small liberal arts school outside of Boston” printed on my diploma, nor about my senior thesis topic, nor about the final club fiasco. They will see through any pretending or pretense in an instant, and the road to earning the respect of my subordinates and superiors will become far longer and harder.
A brand-new lieutenant will not only outrank all the enlisted soldiers in their unit, but will be expected to train those same soldiers who have decades more of collective experience in the force. They will be expected to mentor and counsel younger and older soldiers on not just military competencies, but personal and family issues as well. I have received some excellent training over the past few years, but I will still not be fully prepared for the first time a private younger than me with a spouse and child comes to me with a marital problem. (Which will happen.)
In addition to these personal, micro, and routine requirements of platoon leadership, a lieutenant must understand how smaller platoon and company missions nest within higher echelon battalion and brigade missions. Our seemingly small-unit leadership never happens in a vacuum, but is encased in large-scale operations that ultimately serves some grand strategy.
I don’t have many qualifications to wax poetic about foreign policy, and I don’t think I could tell you what that grand strategy or broad vision of American power is (or has been in the last few decades). But I’m not alone; many military members and civilian commentators (who are much more intelligent than me) have expressed concerns about the costs of America’s strategic fog. Everyone is wont to make everything about Donald Trump nowadays, but some observers argue that much of our current void has been the product of three decades of vaguely defined campaigns in the Middle East and an intensely high operational tempo that restricts our long-run vision and posturing.
The U.S. military produces no shortage of strategic documents and statements outlining our future desired capabilities or describing those of our enemy, but as self-sufficient and initiative-seizing as it professes to be, the U.S. military is not simply an autonomous force that exerts its own will or vision. The creed of every U.S. Army soldier includes a promise to serve the American people, and the military is ultimately at the service of civilian leadership.
We will have to make hard decisions and set clear conditions for American influence in a challenging post-counterinsurgency environment, and our civilian leaders must be a critical part of that effort. I see adversaries willing to play the long game with greater coherence and cunning, but fewer qualms, than we are. I see a rising China willing to wait us out to achieve hegemony in the Indo-Pacific region while also aiming to be the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. I see the signals of an active state of cyber war with Russia, an actor who I also believe has out-maneuvered us in the Middle East.
If the lowest echelons of my platoon are expected to know and understand their “butter bar” lieutenant’s desired end-states and conditions, I expect even more from the “brass stars” of military and civilian leadership to articulate the same for grand strategy.
Time is not necessarily on our side. General Mark Milley, likely the future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has warned that “the faint clouds of a coming storm are visible on the horizon.”
I do not want to be dour or doomsday-cometh here. None of these strategic fears will diminish my enthusiasm for training and developing my future soldiers. I intend to execute every lawful order given to me, and to become a tactical master of the art of artillery before waxing too non-poetic about strategy. What this new “butter bar” will ask of the “brass stars” is a vision to guide the force and the country through its current strategic fog, and in return will do whatever it takes to lead her soldiers to that place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the recent efforts by the new Harvard central administration to “take the Pulse” of the Harvard community regarding diversity and inclusion, there remains an angle that has not been fully addressed. This is one regarding the living space and the living environment of College students. I wish I could say differently, but in my time at Harvard, the College’s House system made me wish I had chosen another school.
I graduated from the College in 2016 and now work for the University. In my time here, issues of belonging and inclusion have always been a part of the discourse around exclusive spaces on campus. Final clubs and exclusive organizations are seen as inaccessible and problematic. Yet, regardless of morality or tales of wrongdoing, there is still a pull for students to spend time on the couches in their darkly-lit halls. It is supply for a demand that the outgoing administration did not manage to put its finger on.
The House renovations began in my freshman year. The old Houses had large common rooms in suites. The new, renovated Houses? Single bedrooms on a hallway and common rooms with unfathomable glass doors. Suites were having common rooms removed from their plans. Most confusingly, adults were everywhere.
It is all but required of Harvard students to live on campus in the Houses. Finding an affordable apartment in Cambridge is near impossible for a 19-year-old, and finding a group of friends to leave a House with is even harder. Accepting Harvard means accepting the status quo as far as House life goes. This is why it is crucial for this status quo to be one that meets student needs.
Right now, the current status quo promotes a sense of being halfway — of being not quite free to be “in college” while also being a quasi-adult living in an apartment complex. Students’ freedom is limited by the lack of resident assistants who are their ages, as are common at other colleges. Instead, the Houses are home to graduate student tutors and other adult administrators who live in the same building or even in the room next door.
By day, many of these adults are administrators. By night, they are neighbors with the power to enforce hazy rules however they want. In my time at the College, I knew of adults in Houses enforcing behavior due to personal preferences, such as discouraging drinking culture and demanding music be turned down because they had sleeping babies. I always felt like I was living in someone else’s home.
Our House believed in hosting activities such as financially sponsoring pastry decorating contests, in screening Finding Nemo, and in doing Disney Karaoke with tutors’ kids in the main common rooms on weekends.
I might sound like a jerk for saying this, but no thanks.
These activities are all lovely, but let us be clear — this is a college. College students have a right to a college existence, and to opt-into any cozy support system when they need it. These sorts of social events can’t compete with final clubs, which provide the age-appropriate events that college students want.
It is possible the College seeks to support students via such coddling. But live-in administrators are not a substitute for well-functioning mental health resources. Most importantly, the freedom to live in one’s environment as a true college student goes a long way in terms of independence and mental health. The College would be better able to support students by improving access to mental health services and making House support systems opt-in, rather than opt-out environments.
The benefits of House life that Harvard extols during the admissions process operate as a major selling point. Students are told they will have a support system built in, a sense of family. And though this may be true, prospective students have the right to know that these glowing statements conflate the great things about residential living with the idea that residential living must come hand in hand with living with adults.
Students who are essentially forced to be on-campus have the right to live in a college environment, with tacit permission to have fun in their rooms and the right to be rowdy within acceptable boundaries found on other campuses. Students should serve as resident assistants. Tutors should serve as on-campus mentors, not as live-in adults who students interact with every day.
Let students have some murky spaces where they live, but ones that are filled with support systems made of peer networks that they create at home.
Reinventing House life to allow Harvard students to live in an intelligent collegiate living environment is a massive step towards a sense of belonging. It is a step toward gender equality and addressing sexual assault, creating an alternative to potentially problematic, off-campus parties. It is a step toward a sense of belonging for all identities, allowing students to be empowered to build community among themselves. It is a step in creating a “supply” so that the demand of students is met, away from external risk.
While the administration is renovating Houses, I implore them to also renovate the structure that promotes these power dynamics and make House life fun again. Not little kid fun, college student fun. This has a great chance to make students feel safe, included, and free in the Houses. As a result, students can be truly proud of a House community that reflects real student desires.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow, you can accomplish this easily. Spending large sums of money renovating brightly lit public spaces like the Smith Campus Center is only one part of the solution. Get your fingers on the wrist again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
A group of academics and students have charged in articles and on Twitter that Dorm Crew — a Harvard College program in which undergraduates clean other students’ bathrooms for pay — is demeaning to the students who participate in it.
Many undergraduate participants, though, say it is a well paying job like any other.
Sara Y. Goldrick-Rab, a professor of higher education at Temple University, sparked a heated exchange on Twitter last Friday with a message questioning the Harvard program.
“Low-income students at HARVARD working 20 hours a week in their first year of college cleaning goddamn dorms?? And we keep giving this wealthy place our public dollars why exactly?” Goldrick-Rab wrote, including a link to a Hechinger Report article on student debt at the nation’s top colleges.
The tweet quickly polarized academics, students, and others who responded on Twitter. Some wrote they agreed with Goldrick-Rab, criticizing with the longstanding College program and arguing it forces low-income students to work for their peers. Others — including many current Dorm Crew captains — disagreed both on Twitter and in interviews with The Crimson, arguing Goldrick-Rab mischaracterized the program.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment on Goldrick-Rab’s tweets.
Dorm Crew, founded in 1951, runs in three phases: Fall Clean-Up, a pre-orientation program for entering freshmen; term-time cleaning in several upperclassmen houses; and Spring Clean-Up following final exams and Commencement each year.
Similar programs have also come under scrutiny after Assistant Professor of Education Anthony A. Jack at Harvard Graduate School of Education published a book on his research on socioeconomic initiatives at elite universities. In the book, he mentions some universities have programs that pay students to do janitorial work. Those students often come from low-income backgrounds.
In an interview with The Crimson, Goldrick-Rab said she is surprised by how strenuously many Dorm Crew participants defended the program.
“It's one thing to do a job right and to feel like it's normal,” she said. “It's a whole other thing to get up there and, like, really fiercely defend it.”
She argued the College should not use public funds — by way of the Federal Work Study program — to pay students’ Dorm Crew wages.
“A $39 billion endowment — you don't have to be using work study funds to pay for them,” she said.
Some students said they enjoy participating in Dorm Crew because the work is more active than many other on-campus jobs.
“I think it's a great opportunity to be able to do, like, physical work,” Dorm Crew captain Alyssa D. Bravin ’20 said in an interview Wednesday. “Because I feel like at school I'm stuck at my desk all the time and doing work on the computer.”
Bravin and other students also pointed to the fact that — with pay starting at $16.25 per hour with the potential for raises — Dorm Crew pays far better than many other on-campus jobs.
“It's a really great way to, like, earn money on campus and offers a flexible schedule,” Grabin said.
Other students tweeted in reply to Goldrick-Rab, arguing she and the Hechinger Report article misrepresented the program.
“I am middle class, on financial aid, and work for Dorm Crew entirely because I want to,” Amanda D. Maille ’21 tweeted in response to Goldrick-Rab.
“I didn't get why she was attacking our organization so much especially because she just knows so little about it,” Maille said in an interview. “No one even cared to ask, ‘Oh, you're in your organization, what do you have to say about it?’ They just completely disregarded us.”
Daniel I. Mendoza ’21, who began working for Dorm Crew in 2017, said he was excited for Fall Clean Up because it was the first job he was able to take after receiving a green card. He said he thinks critics of Dorm Crew do not understand it.
“I saw a lot of it was sort of pointed at this job being a service job, that students should not be doing service jobs for other students. But that's just sort of the definition of a job,” he said. “It takes away from the from the initial point of addressing it as a systematic thing and tries and really only focuses on us.”
Other College students, however, painted very different pictures of Dorm Crew, saying that low-income students often feel pressured into taking jobs that they feel often entail demeaning or degrading work.
“There are some times when I feel like my work isn't respected, or I don't get 'thank you,' or people demand me to quit certain parts of their room that I'm not assigned to clean,” said Tram Nguyen ’22 in an interview Tuesday. “That just makes me feel kind of not respected.”
Some Dorm Crew participants, however, said they think the job is like any other, and the day-to-day work simply involves a few hours of cleaning and getting a rare peek into the lives of their classmates.
“I know that a lot of people put their toothbrush like on the bare counter and I think they should like put it in a cup or something to keep it from touching the counter,” Bravin said of her on-job observations.
“Some people like hoard toilet paper. Some people like never have toilet paper,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to pass resolutions on climate change and prison divestment, establish a summer storage option, and fund Black Graduation at its general meeting Saturday.
The UC voted to endorse Heat Week, a series of events co-sponsored by Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice and Divest Harvard that aims to “draw attention to the severity of the climate crisis and raise the call for Harvard to divest its endowment from the fossil fuel industry,” according to HUEJ’s website.
UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 sponsored the bill, which requires the UC to endorse and publicize Heat Week, as well as support a public forum on the issue of divesting Harvard’s nearly $40 billion endowment from companies related to the fossil fuel industry.
The duo noted 71.5 percent of voters said they support fossil fuel divestment on a referendum included as a part of the November UC presidential election.
Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said he did not support Heat Week, saying that while he “cares deeply” about climate change, he does not believe divestment of the University’s endowment is the proper action. He referred to a Crimson editorial encouraging students to vote against divestment referenda.
Huesa responded that the legislation does not support divestment, but rather Heat Week, which is an opportunity to “talk about climate change.”
The last time Divest Harvard held Heat Week in 2015, activists blockaded Massachuestts Hall and University Hall and occupied the Harvard Alumni Headquarters. For this year's iteration of of Heat Week, student protesters called on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to attend a public forum on fossil fuel divestment. Bacow declined the students' request Wednesday.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the Council’s endorsement of Heat Week.
The council also passed a bill to support a petition by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign. Oak Yard Representative Drake E. Johnson ’22 sponsored the legislation.
The bill requires the UC to publicize the HPDC petition that calls on the University to divest its nearly $40 billion endowment from the prison industry, and will recognize the Council as an endorser of the petition.
In the same referendum that included the issue of fossil fuel divestment, 77.2 percent of voters indicated they support prison divestment.
Dunster House Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said he supports the legislation because the UC should represent its voters, and the majority of voters said they wanted to support the campaign.
Barclay said he does not think the bill is the best way to move forward, since supporting the resolution may associate the council with HDPC’s actions.
“I don’t think that we, as the UC, should be taking such overt stances on such political issues,” he added.
Swain referred to previous statements on divestment in response to the legislation.
“The University’s position, as it has stated previously, is that it should not use the endowment to achieve political ends, or particular policy ends,” Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
The Council voted to endorse the petition, 17-8-1.
The resolution passed, 17-8.
The UC also allocated $13,000 to launch a summer storage initiative for students. The council will rent a warehouse in Boston and provide movers to transport student items from campus to the warehouse and back.
Currently, five upperclassmen houses — Dunster, Leverett, Mather, Quincy, and Winthrop — do not offer free or subsidized summer storage for their students, and the UC’s program will allow students from those houses to use the space.
The UC will select 500 students on a “first-come-first-serve” basis, according to the legislation proposal, with preference to students who are eligible for the Student Events Fund and live far from campus. Each student will be able to store 4 boxes for a total of $15.
UC Treasurer Jack M. Swanson ’22 and six representatives sponsored the legislation.
The initiative was inspired by the results of a UC survey sent to students from upperclassmen houses without summer storage. Roughly half of more than 500 respondents — most of whom were first-generation, low-income, or international college students —gave anecdotal evidence that storage was a cause for concern, according to Quincy House Representative Rushi A. Patel ’21.
The group attempted to negotiate funding from the administration, as well as initiate a program that allows some students to access summer storage in another House that offers it, but both proposals failed, according to Patel. As a result, the group proposed to use UC money to rent a storage space.
The UC passed the bill by unanimous consent.
The UC also funded several student initiatives at its meeting Saturday. In particular, the UC allocated $4,250 for Black Graduation, a ceremony that the Black Graduation Committee holds to “support its black students that are graduating,” according to Agbafe’s act.
The funds would be used towards renting Memorial Church for the venue and supporting the speaker — actress and singer Tatyana M. Ali ’02 — according to Agbafe.
The resolution to fund Black Graduation passed the Council, 23-1-1.

A lawsuit brought by former Harvard Associate Professor Kimberly S. Theidon alleging the University unfairly denied her tenure could be headed to trial after a federal judge said at an appeal hearing Wednesday that the case may be better left to a jury.
Theidon first filed suit in Massachusetts District Court against Harvard in 2015, arguing the University declined to grant her tenure in the Anthropology department after she publicly spoke out about sexual harassment and gender discrimination. United States District Judge Leo T. Sorokin dismissed the case in February 2018, ruling in summary judgement that Theidon did not prove the University discriminated against her or retaliated against her for her comments on sexual harassment.
But this week — nearly five years after she left Harvard — Theidon returned to a federal courtroom to argue her case against the University. U.S. Circuit Judge Juan R. Torruella, one of the three First Circuit court judges on the panel, said during the hearing Wednesday that Theidon’s case should perhaps be heard by a jury, rather than letting the summary judgment stand. In particular, the judge said questions about a tenure committee’s credibility may merit a jury trial.
“The question of credibility is usually left to a jury,” Torruella said. “She had the unanimous support of her colleagues for tenure. That’s not speculation, is it?”
In response, Harvard’s lawyer Martin F. Murphy acknowledged that Theidon indeed had such support.
But Murphy argued that the evidence of gender discrimination amounted to mere “speculation” and “guesswork,” rather than “circumstantial evidence.”
“I think the court, perhaps other scholars — this is the nature of this business — could disagree about whether Professor Theidon should be tenured or not,” he said. “But I would suggest to the court that the real question is whether the plaintiff has offered specific facts which connect the denial of tenure either to gender discrimination or to retaliation for protected conduct.”
In 2013, Theidon called Harvard a “sexually hostile environment” in the comments section of a Crimson article and urged sexual assault victims to speak out. Two months later, she learned her application for tenure had been rejected and that she would need to leave Harvard within a year.
Speaking before the panel of judges on Wednesday, Theidon’s attorney Lauren A. Khouri reiterated her client’s claims that, in denying her tenure, Harvard violated Theidon’s rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and a corresponding Massachusetts law.
Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, such as sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, while Title IX specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs or activities that receive federal funding.
Khouri said in court on Wednesday that in 2008, when her client was promoted to associate professor, the then-acting chair of the Anthropology department told Theidon that she would need to “behave like a dutiful daughter” and that her tenure application would be “held to a higher standard” than her male co-workers’ applications.
“With disputed facts and questions of credibility, Dr. Theidon’s claims were prematurely dismissed,” Khouri said.
In a brief submitted to the court, Harvard’s lawyers argued that since Theidon’s comments did not qualify as an official complaint to her department superiors about sexual assault — as is necessary under Title IX for her to successfully claim unjust treatment — the University could not have broken the law in its tenure decision, Law360 reported Wednesday.
University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that Theidon’s allegations “continue to be flatly wrong.”
“There is no merit whatsoever to her allegations of discrimination or retaliation,” Cowenhoven wrote. “Any advocacy on Dr. Theidon's part on behalf of victims of sexual harassment and sexual assault at Harvard was not known, let alone considered, as part of the University's decision on her tenure case. Moreover, such advocacy would never adversely affect a tenure decision at Harvard.”
Theidon wrote in an email that she is “pleased” with the appeal’s progress.
“Various Harvard administrators, including former [University] President Drew [G.] Faust and Provost [Alan M.] Garber [’76], have encouraged people to come forward and surface incidents of sexual harassment and gender bias,” Theidon wrote. “That encouragement will be unproductive unless people know they will not be retaliated against for speaking out.”

More than 900 attendees flocked to the fifth annual Brazil Conference hosted at Harvard and MIT this weekend featuring Vice President of Brazil Hamilton M. Mourão and former Brazilian president Fernando H. Cardoso, among other high-profile speakers.
With the theme “Juntos Somos Mais” (Portuguese for "Together We Are More"), this year’s conference saw an approximately 50 percent increase in the number of attendees from last year. The weekend-long event also welcomed billionaire businessman Jorge Paulo Lemann and former Ecuadorian president Jamil Mahuad.
The conference’s mission was to bring Brazilian conversations about business, politics, and technology to Harvard and MIT, according to conference co-president Pedro Farias ’20.
“Distance allows us to create a platform of dialogue and conversation that would not be possible in Brazil,” Farias said. “We think that the community of Brazilians in Boston is very strong … and that allows us to have this form of debate.”
Cardoso, Mahuad, and Gonzalo Koncke, chief of staff of the secretary general of the Organization of American States, spoke on a panel entitled “Diplomacy” on Saturday.
Later that evening, Lemann along with the College’s Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 spoke to a packed lecture hall of audience and press members in a session titled “Developing the Leaders of Tomorrow.” When asked how they define “great people,” Lemann — whose firm 3G Capital owns Kraft Foods and Burger King — spoke about how he chooses people to work alongside him in his businesses.
“The basic principles are basically people who can do very well on their own, people who have proven they can get something done, people who can work for others, and people that are totally ethical,” Lemann said.
Fitzsimmons spoke about how he chooses to admit students who he believes will be successful at Harvard and cited diligence as a key factor.
“A lot of people, I think, may underrate the value of hard work,” Fitzsimmons said. “They might think that flash and charisma or superficiality might win the day, and about 99 percent of the time, it’s going to be hard work.”
Farias said that one of the highlights of the conference was orchestrating a surprise in which he brought out 3G Capital executives Carlos A. Sicupira and Marcel H. Telles to meet with Lemann. The trio have been business partners for decades but “are never seen together in public,” according to Farias.
Leading a team of more than 100 conference organizers comprising students from Harvard, MIT, and other universities, Farias called this year’s conference one of “breaking records.” In addition to the 900 who attended in person, Farias say more than 30,000 people watched online.
“We also had the most number of speakers, the most number of students participate in the event — the largest team ever — so it’s really continuing to grow at a rapid pace,” he said.
Elene Silva, a freshman at Emory University who attended the conference, said the weekend allowed her to connect with Brazil from thousands of miles away.
“You like to have a part of home in the U.S., so everybody here speaks Portuguese basically,” Silva said. “So to me, it’s more than just a way to debate, to connect with companies and employers. It’s something really good to reconnect with my country and be able to really understand what’s happening down there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students packed into Tercentenary Theatre Sunday to watch Kiiara and Bazzi perform at Yardfest, the College’s annual spring outdoor concert planned by the College Events Board.
Kiiara took the stage in the late afternoon sunshine, performing a set including her songs “Messy” and “Heavy” while twirling across the stage in a neon windbreaker. While Kiiara performed, students tossed an inflatable beach ball throughout the audience, and repeatedly launched it onto the stage, shouting for Kiiara to toss it back.
A few minutes after Kiiara left the stage, the opening notes of her hit song “Gold” — which peaked at number 13 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 2016 — boomed out of the speakers. She ran back onto the stage to rousing cheers to perform the song for the exuberant crowd.
After a short break, “Mine” singer Bazzi took the stage just as the sun started to set. By the time he walked off, the dark evening was illuminated by giant glow sticks handed out to audience members and flashing lights onstage.
“Are you getting lit on this side tonight?” Bazzi screamed to students on both sides of the stage.
“When I do some stupid shit in like 50 years, hoping one of you guys will bail me out of jail,” he joked, drawing laughs from the crowd.
Bazzi performed a number of his most popular songs, including “Beautiful” and chart-topping “Mine” from his 2018 album “COSMIC.” Students screamed the words to both the songs, jumping up and down and pressing toward the stage.
Several students said they enjoyed the performances and that the event was much better than they had expected.
“Bazzi turned Yardfest around,” Lawson Z. Wong ’21 said. “He completely exceeded my expectations.”
“I thought they did a really good job of getting the entire student body into their act,” Jimmy Lin ’22 said. “I think a lot of the students were really hesitant about how it was going to be, given the changes that Harvard instituted this year to Yardfest, but I think the artists did a really good job of being able to unite the student body and being able to get the energy through the entire crowd.”
Those changes included instituting a no-guest policy, preventing students from re-entering Tercentenary Theatre if they left, and holding the event on a Sunday afternoon. College administrators have previously said the changes stem from recommendations issued by a committee tasked with evaluating Harvard policies after a black Harvard undergraduate was forcibly arrested the night of last year's Yardfest. The incident drew allegations of police brutality and led some students to call on Harvard to improve its policies for the event.
The concert opened with two student acts, Extra Extra and Maybe There’s Life. The two groups won the “Battle for Yardfest” competition in Sanders Theatre late last month.
“They were really great, they had a great energy,” Robert E. S. McKenzie ’22 said of Extra Extra. “Better than the actual Yardfest performers.”
“I thought the first act was really good, it was great to hear them play some really classic punk rock at the end,” Cedric H. T. Li ’21 said. “It’s a genre that’s sort of forgotten recently, and it’s great to see an act reviving those classic sounds.”
Though Li said he is not a fan of hip hop, he said he thinks many attendees enjoyed Maybe There’s Life.
“I think it’s great that there’s been a diversity of music available here on campus this Yardfest,” Li said. “I think the CEB did a really good job catering to all different choices.”
Throughout the event, students enjoyed dinner served in the Yard and ate desserts from food trucks including Zinneken's, and played life-size versions of games like jenga, checkers, and chess.
Crimson EMS, Securitas, and Harvard University Police Department were visible throughout the event, tending to students.
“It’s been awesome seeing a lot of people come together, let loose from their classes, and be able to enjoy their time together,” Lin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Democrats at Harvard are divided over their early picks for the party’s 2020 primary, which is on track to feature the largest set of Democratic presidential candidates in history.
Harvard Democrats President Hank Sparks ’21 said that members are beginning to form subgroups in support of particular candidates. Sparks said the organization itself is “almost certainly” not going to endorse a primary candidate, consistent with the group’s past precedent.
“We value the contest of ideas that’s happening,” Sparks said.
Matthew J. Keating ’20, Molly M. Martinez ’22, and Selena X. Zhang ’22 traveled to New Hampshire on Saturday to attend an event for New Jersey Senator and presidential hopeful Cory A. Booker. Zhang, who co-directs Harvard College for Booker alongside Martinez, said she is looking forward to garnering enthusiasm for Booker.
“We’re planning on doing an official launch for Harvard College for Cory soon, and we’re hoping it will involve a lot of things like this — going up to New Hampshire, getting face-to-face time with the Senator and really making that connection,” Zhang said.
Martinez said her support for Booker is informed by her experience growing up in a predominately Hispanic, low-income area.
“I’ve seen the inequalities that we face from the local governments, state governments, and federal government on basically the treatment of citizens,” Martinez said. “What really struck me is the way that Cory advocates for all people — whether you have a ton of money, whether you have a little bit of money, no matter your background.”
Michael B. Baick ’22, chair of the Harvard for Pete subgroup, said he did not initially plan to support a candidate in the Democratic primary. Then, the campaign of Pete Buttigieg ’04, mayor of South Bend, Ind., caught his attention.
“What I saw in Pete Buttigieg, though, was a great candidate — someone who brings the oft-described but rarely possessed trait of leadership to the field, someone who I think has an ability to speak beyond polemics,” Baick said.
Baick, who had the opportunity to speak with Buttigieg during the mayor’s Institute of Politics visit on Wednesday, said he thinks the rush of Democrats entering the primary is likely due to the upheaval created by the 2016 presidential election.
“I think that a lot of it is because of the decimation which was 2016, the complete upsetting of the political order,” Baick said. “There’s a complete vacuum in terms of what the new message is going to be, what new policies are going to be, what anything is going to be.”
Noah T. Redlich ’21, another member of the Harvard Democrats, said he also thinks that without a clear front runner, 2020 is shaping up to be a different story.
“The [2016] nomination felt more like a coronation than a true competitive process, and I think Democrats wanted to change that this time around,” Redlich said.
Redlich is supporting Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary.
“I was a strong supporter of his in 2016. I felt that he had a really strong message,” Redlich said. “He’s consistently been among the least hawkish, most pro-peace Democrats in the Senate.”
JFK Jr. Forum committee member and former CIVICs chair Damian L. Richardson ’20 said he knew he wanted to support California Senator Kamala D. Harris since former United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ confirmation hearings.
“I think she represents a really good foil to the president. She sort of embodies truth, justice, and I think she’s going to be the best person to take the fight to Donald Trump,” Richardson said. “I’m also just really excited to see a woman president, and a woman of color especially.”
Richardson will be interning with Harris’s New Hampshire campaign team this summer. He urged Harvard students to take advantage of the school’s resources and its proximity to the first primary state as the 2020 election approaches.
“There is no time like now to get civically involved, and if you feel strongly about someone, take the hour trip up to New Hampshire during the school year and canvass,” Richardson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 11, 2019 at 2:54 p.m.
The Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee hosted Israeli Apartheid Week this past week, aiming to raise awareness for Palestinians who “suffer brutal occupation and oppression,” through a series of events including performances and speeches according to the week’s Facebook page.
Some students and Harvard affiliates, however, have said they disapprove of the programming, sparking heated conversations about whether the week’s events – as planned — have a place on campus. The events attracted negative responses on Twitter from United States Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former University President Lawrence Summers.
“Israeli Apartheid Week is an international movement among college campuses worldwide that raises awareness regarding the plight of the Palestinians and the struggles they face with illegal Israeli occupation,” PSC co-president Christian B. Tabash ’21, said in an interview.
During a contentious Undergraduate Council meeting on March 31, students debated the UC’s decision to allocate funds for PSC to host the week’s events. The Council ultimately voted to allocate PSC $2,050.
Harvard Hillel released a statement on April 1 criticizing the decision, describing IAW’s portrayal of Israel-Palestine relations as “simplistic.”
Hillel president Rebecca Thau ’20 said in an interview that she was disappointed by IAW’s choice to take an “anti-Israel stance” rather than a “pro-Palestine” or “pro-conversation” one.
“It is in my mind concerning that the Undergraduate Council, which is supposed to represent all of the students on this campus, would be the ones underwriting a week that splits apart Harvard undergraduates instead of creating the kind of conversation and debate and learning that we all deserve,” she said.
Responding to Thau’s comments in an interview, Tabash said that PSC’s mission is not “anti-anything” but “pro-equal rights.”
“The events of IAW and work of the PSC are for human rights and against human rights abuses and atrocities. It's that simple,” Tabash said. “It shouldn't be controversial to be against an apartheid and two-tiered legal system with relation to the Palestinians and the Israelis.”
“Our objective is to make that known and to highlight injustices towards a people that has been historically underrepresented, demonized and dehumanized,” he added.
The controversy surrounding the UC’s decision and resulting media attention led to College administrators to email the PSC about concerns they developed over student safety during the week’s events, specifically at the Black-Palestinian Solidarity event Tuesday.
Associate Director of Student Organizations and Resources JonRobert Bagley sent an email to PSC, a copy of which The Crimson obtained, Monday evening notifying the group that he would sit in the event as an observer. He added that the Harvard University Police Department would be required to be at the event and PSC would be charged for the security costs.
“If there is a disruption that I feel violates someone’s free speech, I will warn the individual and hope the conversation continues,” he wrote. “If the disruption continues I will ask the person to leave. With this, we will be required to have an HUPD presence on sight. This will be billed to the organization.”
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Free Speech Guidelines state that Harvard will determine “whether protection of free speech at an open meeting requires security measures,” but that “the University will fund these measures.”
Radhika Sainath, a lawyer for Palestine Legal — a a nonprofit that "protects the civil and constitutional rights of people in the U.S. who speak out for Palestinian freedom," according to its website — emailed Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair requesting an explanation of why Harvard was not paying the security fee on Tuesday. She also asked whether the event would be allowed if PSC declined to pay the fee.
“Students and professors and and community members should be able to gather and to hear and to listen to these debates, to these talks, and to these other perspectives without fear of censorship or having to pay extra money,” Sainath said in an interview on Friday after the event.
Sainath added in the interview that Harvard administrators said they would not charge PSC for any security costs.
Bagley apologized to the event organizers for attempting to charge the fee during at Tuesday’s event, according to a statement from Palestine Legal. Bagley did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The event featured former CNN contributor and Temple University Professor Marc Lamont Hill, African American Studies Professor Cornel R. West, and Dima Khalidi, founder and director of Palestine Legal.
The goal of the event — which more than 200 people attended — was to discuss the importance of “mutual solidarity between the Black Liberation Movement and the Palestinian struggle against Israeli injustice,” according to the Facebook event page.
In collaboration with several other campus organizations, PSC also unveiled a Wall of Resistance in the Science Center Plaza on Wednesday evening. The rest of the week’s events included a rally commemorating the Great March of Return protests in the Gaza strip border with Israel, a performance by Palestinian poet and activist Remi Kanazi, a screening of “1948: Creation and Catastrophe,” and a talk titled “Demystifying BDS” by Rabab Abdulhadi, a professor at San Francisco State University.
BDS — short for Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions — is an international movement that “works to end international support for Israel's oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law,” according to its website.
PSC also sponsored a student panel titled “Voices of Palestine” on March 31. Panelists — including Palestinian students at Harvard, an MIT student who lives in Gaza, and Oren R. Or ’22, an Israeli Jew — shared their experiences living in Palestine and Israel.
“Growing up within Israeli society, it’s very hard to see that there is an occupation,” Rimon said in an interview after the panel. “It takes many efforts and time to understand that what you have been told most of your life is not necessarily true. So I spoke about the things that have led me to see that there is an occupation, and that I should resist it.”
Correction: April 11, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to PSC co-president Christian Tabash as PSC's president.
Correction: April 11, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Palestine Legal co-sponosred the Black-Palestinian Solidarity event. In fact, the group did not sponsor the event.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard College student and a Winthrop House tutor filed conflicting police reports referencing each other with the Harvard University Police Department after an incident in the House’s dining hall Wednesday evening.
Danu A. K. Mudannayake ’20 — an Eliot House resident — and Winthrop senior tutor Carl L. Miller gave differing accounts of a confrontation between the two of them in the dining hall Wednesday. Mudannayake, who is also a Crimson design editor, said she approached Miller after he allegedly took photos and videos of her while she ate dinner with a friend. Miller and his wife Valencia Miller both wrote in emails that Mudannayake allegedly harassed and provoked him as their family ate.
Miller wrote in an email that he filed a report with HUPD after an “obvious provocation” from Mudannayake, per House protocol.
“The police report was filed as a result of Danu Muddanyake's obvious provocation, harassment and due to her threat against my three month old child,” Miller wrote. “I will allow the formal police investigation to unfold and I am confident that the truth will be revealed and Ms. Muddanyake's intent and true motives and involvement will come to light.”
Mudannayake said she was eating in the dining hall Wednesday evening with a friend because her house’s dining hall was closed for a student-faculty dinner. As she ate, she saw Miller appear to point his phone in her direction across the room. She said Miller did not acknowledge her when she approached him and tried to get his attention to ask him why he seemed to take photos or videos of her.
Valencia Miller wrote in an emailed statement that she and her husband were taking photos of their child that night while they were eating with students. She wrote that Mudannayake “accosted” her husband.
Carl Miller did not respond to Mudannayake. Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. then entered the dining hall and spoke with Carl Miller, according to Mudannayake. She said Sullivan asked her for the details of her encounter with Carl Miller and told her to follow up with him via email.
Sullivan did not respond to a request for comment.
Following the incident, Mudannayake said she filed a report with HUPD later Wednesday evening. Both Mudannayake and Miller said they were later informed the other had filed a report about the event.
The pair of reports come during a semester in which Winthrop House has been a center of controversy. On Jan. 23, Sullivan announced he would represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as he stands accused of rape.
In the months since, Mudannayake and other students have protested in Harvard Yard, signed open letters, and distributed flyers, arguing that Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein is incompatible with his role as a faculty dean.
Valencia Miller wrote in an emailed statement that she felt unsafe in Winthrop House because of Mudannayake’s actions.
“I experienced the latest episode in an escalating pattern of harassment against my home and my husband that pierced my heart because it involved my child,” she wrote.
Valencia Miller added that she has worked since January to foster a positive environment for Winthrop students amid campus discussions of Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein.
“For the last few months, a small group of students have continued to escalate a controversy around our Faculty Dean’s representation of Harvey Weinstein,” Miller wrote. “I have worked to encourage students to discuss different points of view with civility, grace and understanding.”
Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers wrote in an emailed statement that she directs House staff to contact “appropriate authorities” when safety concerns arise.
“Last week's incident was incredibly upsetting and should never have happened. Everyone in the Houses deserves to feel safe and be treated with respect,” Chavers wrote. “I have always directed all tutors to call HUPD when there's a safety concern as is the policy amongst all resident deans and tutors across all Houses.”
Amber A. James ’11 — a Winthrop House tutor and Harvard Law School student — wrote in a statement that the “escalation of harassment is unacceptable, inappropriate and intolerable.” She distributed the statement to other house tutor staff Sunday, but did not indicate which tutors signed onto the statement.
“As tutors, we wholeheartedly condemn this attack,” James wrote. “As concerned members of the Winthrop community, we call on the administration to respond to these repeated attacks on our House.”
In February, Mudannayake and other students distributed flyers depicting an illustration of Sullivan. That same day in a separate incident, an unknown vandal spray painted slogans calling for Sullivan to step down from his post as faculty dean on the exterior of Winthrop. Hours later, Sullivan and co-Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson emailed residents condemning the graffiti.
A week later, Sullivan and Robinson emailed Winthrop residents stating some students raised concerns about the flyers, which the students called “racially offensive.” Mudannayake has previously said she believed their response was an attempt to “diverge the spotlight off of the survivors in Winthrop House.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment via email on Thursday, citing department policy that bars him from identifying parties, witnesses, victims, or suspects. An HUPD officer went to the Winthrop House dining hall Wednesday evening to respond to “suspicious activity,” according to the HUPD police log.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an incredible midseason surge brought the men’s lacrosse team to above .500 for the first time this season, the Crimson had its three-game win streak snapped against its first ranked opponent since taking on No. 12/14 North Carolina in the season opener.
The Crimson resumed regular season play after a 10-day break since their last game, in which the team picked up their third win in eight days against Albany (4-6, 3-1 America East Conference). Harvard used this extended break to practice and prepare for one of the biggest games of the season. Dawning its white uniforms, the Crimson walked onto Harvard Stadium, not Jordan Field, for a matchup against Ivy foe Cornell (7-3, 2-2 Ivy League).
It did not take long for things to heat up, as the Big Red was able to take the early lead by netting a goal less than a minute into the game. However, the Crimson was determined to hang in the game and to not get shaken up so easily by a rough start. With 8:32 left in the first quarter, standout freshman attacker Austin Madronic evened the game at one apiece with a crafty backhanded scoop shot from just outside the crease.
Over the remainder of the first quarter, the teams battled back and forth, with neither able to gain the upper hand over the other. Cornell would score, but before it could extend the lead, Harvard would battle back and retaliate with a goal of its own. Junior attacker and tri-captain Kyle Anderson was able to put in two of his three goals on the day in the first quarter, and as the opening period finally drew to a close, the Crimson found itself in a tightly contested game, down only 4-3.
However, this one-goal deficit would prove to be the closest Harvard would come for the rest of the game. Cornell came out strong in the second quarter and outscored Harvard 4-1. The Big Red played masterful defense, as the only goal it let up came with 4:55 left in the quarter to sophomore attacker Myles Hamm. After a competitive start, the Crimson found itself doubled 8-4 heading into halftime.
Despite talking things over during the break, Harvard was unable to build any momentum and the third quarter followed the script of the second. Cornell scored a goal 35 seconds into the new frame, and although junior midfielder Nigel Andrews answered back, the effort was not enough to mount the comeback needed. Anderson completed his hat trick in the third, and junior midfielder Jeremy Magno added a goal of his own, but the Cornell offense proved to be too overwhelming and when the third concluded, the Crimson found itself down 13-7.
In the fourth, the Big Red continued to build its lead. At one point, Cornell went up 19-8, marking the largest deficit of the day for the Crimson. However, before the game concluded, the Crimson was able to net a few more goals, including one from Hamm that secured his hat trick.
Harvard ended up losing the game 19-11, but despite the tough match, the team is making sure to remain optimistic heading into the final three games of the season. “That game was a tough one to stomach, but Cornell played well and we will look to improve all over the field,” said Anderson.
The Crimson take the field next on Saturday, April 13 against Penn in Harvard stadium. With the team back even at 5-5, the season can still go any way. Picking up some more conference wins would be significant, but at the same time, a few more loses would be devastating. At such a crucial point in the season, the Crimson is turning to its veterans to lead the team.
“We have an incredibly positive team and that really starts with our small group of seniors. The six of them are the closest friends on our team and they’re great at keeping our team’s attitude consistently positive,” said Anderson. “With only a few regular season games left, every game becomes like a playoff game. We can’t wait to play Penn in Harvard Stadium next Saturday.”
After Penn (6-3, 4-0), the team will travel to Princeton University to take on the Tigers (4-6, 0-3). Finally, on April 27, the team will close out the regular season with a critical game against No. 5 Yale (7-2, 3-1). The rivalry match will be played at Harvard Stadium and the Crimson is very much looking for an opportunity to redeem itself and prove that it is still a force to be reckoned with.
“The next three games will be no different from the last three for us,” said Madronic when asked about the team’s mentality heading into the end of the season. “We will play motivated and give our all to try to extend our season and win an Ivy League Championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another spring. Another strenuous training regiment that began in the fall and persisted through the winter. Another thawing of the River Charles. And yet another series of campaigns for the four Harvard varsity rowing teams. Two weeks into spring competition, all crews have already made a strong impression.
The No. 3 men’s heavyweight crew ventured to Cornell, which hugs the southern tip of Cayuga Lake in Ithaca, N.Y., the scene of this weekend’s battle. The Crimson dominated both the No. 12 Big Red as well as No. 15 George Washington, taking all four races, including a dominating finish in the first varsity eight. Harvard finished more than nine seconds in front of second-place Cornell, crossing the finish in 5:38.2.
“It was a good race from the start,” senior Liam Corrigan said. “We got a second or so off the start in the first 20 strokes of the race, and then throughout the rest of the race, we kept on gradually taking on a little bit more distance; that was a good result.”
Corrigan said that the training that leads up to the races in the spring is tough but fulfilling.
“It’s a lot of time on the erg; it can be quite painful at times, but when you actually get going on the water and race other boats and beat other boats, that is just super gratifying,” Corrigan said. “All the work you’ve been doing for months and months pays off. It’s great to do that with eight other guys in the boat and as part of the team.”
The No. 4 Radcliffe lightweight crew hosted No. 3 Princeton on the Charles. The Tigers emerged with a victory, finishing the 1V in 6:50.9 to the Black and White’s 7:01.0 and taking the Class of 1999 Cup in the process. Radcliffe dominated the Tigers in the 3V with a nine-second victory in 7:25.3. Last week, the team took the Class of 2004 Cup from No. 4 Georgetown, edging out the opponent by just over three seconds in the first varsity eight with a time of 6:17.5.
“I think we came out with a really strong start; we were able to build on the foundation and overall fitness we gained over the winter,” said senior Tessa Buchan about the victory over Georgetown. “I thought it was a really good start to our season.”
Radcliffe looks forward to facing Princeton for the Knecht Cup next weekend.
“I think overall, through all the boats, we’re gaining fitness and we’re showing overall we’re a faster team compared to last year and made a lot of gains in the winter,” Buchan said. “We’re seeing that in the spring, and I’m excited to keep on racing. The first two weekends have shown there’s a lot of improvement to come.”
The No. 14 Radcliffe heavyweight crew finished runner up for the Class of 1875 Plaque and Class of 1975 Cup at the Ivy Round Robins at Princeton this weekend. The Black and White finished second in the varsity eight for the Class of 1984 Plaque to Princeton; the Tigers clocked in at 6:25.3 to Radcliffe’s 6:29.0. Princeton also took the Class of 1975 Cup with a time of 6:13.1 to the Black and White’s 6:25.5. Last week, at the Ivy League/Big Ten Double Duals at Michigan, Radcliffe shined on day two of the event, winning the varsity eight in 6:40.8 over second place Indiana in 6:42.5 and taking the second varsity eight with a time of 7:01.4, three seconds faster than second place Michigan State.
The No. 5 Men’s Lightweight Crew took the Wales-Kirrane Cup over both No. 3 Columbia and No. 8 Georgetown this weekend at the Lions’ Overpeck Park. Harvard’s 1V finished in 5:42.85 to Columbia’s 5:44.48 and Georgetown’s 5:52.95. The Crimson also took both the 3V, the 4V, and the 5V4+. The team also won two of four races at the Matthews-Leonard Cup, in which they competed against No. 5 Penn and No. 2 Cornell on the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania. Harvard finished first in both the 3V and the 4V. Cornell did win the 1V in 5:38.2 to secure the cup.
Overall, both Corrigan and Buchan noted how exciting it is to finally get into the swing of racing. All four crews look to race in a smattering of regular season matches before the large regattas of the postseason.
“I think we have a strong senior class and good leaders in the senior class, and I also think the freshmen bring a lot to this program,” Corrigan said. “They’re super energetic; they’re super fast on the water. It’s a good group of guys and we enjoy even riding the bus up to Ithaca and everything. Definitely a lot of the fun comes from rowing, but a lot of it comes from being with a great group of guys as well.”
Buchan echoed many of these sentiments and particularly emphasized the quality of trust that her team has.
“I think RVL is a team that has incredible trust amongst each other, whether you’re in the same boat or not,” Buchan said. “While you’re on the erg, it’s an isolated situation; you’re trusting yourself. But when we’re all together, you know that we’ve all completed the same workout, you’re pulling for not only yourself and the girls who’ve been in the seat before you but who will be in that seat next year and the years following.”

When senior infielder Edwin Owolo walked to the plate to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning, the outcome of the first half of a doubleheader against Yale on Saturday afternoon seemed a foregone conclusion. Harvard baseball had notched just a single first-inning run, and trailed 8-1 entering the final frame of play. 
Owolo, who replaced Quinn Hoffman as a pinch hitter, worked a walk, spurring one of the most incredible innings in Crimson history. 
Junior pitcher Kieran Shaw: We felt confident going into the game. We knew that Hunter was on the mound and he’s our guy, but things just spun out of control in a couple of innings.
Head coach Bill Decker: Our guys grinded a little bit today. Bigge didn’t have his great stuff but he gutted it out for 120 pitches and Jack kept it there. Then we played a little bit cleaner.
Starter Hunter Bigge labored through seven innings, exiting with Harvard trailing by a 7-1 scoreline. When sparingly-used sophomore reliever Jack Mahala entered the contest, the Crimson’s odds seemed long. But the Far Hills, N.J., native kept Harvard close enough, yielding a lone run across his two innings of relief. Mahala’s outing set the stage for a comeback that stunned everyone, with the exception of the men in the dugout. 
Shaw: We were running back to the dugout in the bottom of the ninth saying “if there’s a time, why not now?” We just wanted to go get it. We watched a couple of guys get a couple of hits, and there was no telling what could happen. 
Junior infielder Chad Minato: We were just trying to get guys on base, and we just kept going and going and going. And then we were like “Oh my gosh - we are actually right back in this game.”
After drawing his walk to lead off the inning, Owolo scored when Bigge drew a base-on-balls with the bases loaded. Minato followed that up with a single that scored two, closing the deficit to 8-4.
Owolo: We just went up there aggressive in the ninth inning and we got guys on. We started making things happen, and there’s no telling what we can do when we get hot.
Senior first baseman Patrick McColl: We start with a pinch hitter, and we tried just to get a little rally going. We got four straight on, and after we scored three runs, we were thinking “hey, there’s something going here.”
Mrwoka’s at bat, though, was one of the most crucial of the entire game. With two outs, he was pinch-hitting for Owolo, who had been inserted into the lineup earlier in the very same inning. The sophomore patiently worked a walk, waiting out Yale’s Bobby Cecere and juicing the bases.
Coach Decker: It’s just one of those things where you get a guy on and you just try to keep the line moving. I thought our guys had really good at bats. Eddie led it off and then Pat and Sudsie, and we had a big at-bat by Mrwoka in my opinion. He was being patient and brought in a couple of side guys.
Senior Devan Peterson added another run to the Crimson tally with a pinch-hit single, and Minato himself eventually scored off of a single from senior Ben Skinner that brought the score to 8-6. 
Mrwoka: We had a lot of good, patient at-bats. We worked counts and got on base, and then we gave it to the big guy who took care of us.
Mrwoka’s base-on-balls brought up Pat McColl, the senior whose torrid start to the season has been one for the ages. McColl, the leading hitter in the entire conference, stepped to the plate in the situation players can only dream about — bases loaded, two outs, bottom of the ninth inning. 
Coach Decker: And then, it was just set up. You have Pat, your three-hole hitter, and he’s been doing such a great job for us not just this year but for four years.
And, fittingly, McColl replied to the storybook situation with a fairy-tale ending, crushing a no-doubt grand slam to right-center to send the Crimson to a walk-off 10-8 victory.
Mahala: That was one of the craziest baseball moments I’ve ever experienced. That was just unbelievable, a never give up attitude. We never had a doubt when McColl came up to bat. I was like “this is going to be a home run.” And he delivered - it was unbelievable.
Freshman pitcher James Kirkpatrick: It was crazy. Everyone contributed, and Pat’s been our most reliable hitter all year. So when he got up, we were all pretty hyped. He was just so clutch. It was the most exciting baseball game I’ve ever been a part of.
Owolo: Nobody could really have scripted that. It was insane. That was definitely the greatest thing that I’ve experienced in a Harvard crimson uniform. 
Just over three hours later, Harvard put the finishing touches on a 3-0 win in the second game of the double-header, but all anyone could talk about was McColl’s magical moment. 
Junior outfielder Jake Suddleson: It’s hard to put into words. I mean, that only happens in backyard baseball. You can’t make that up. It was something that I think all of us will cherish for a really long time. There’s nobody else that we’d want in that spot other than Pat, and he came through. It was awesome.
Coach Decker: It was just one of those things where our guys believe in one another and have that positive chemistry on the team. They invest in one another. It was one of those things where we got the big hit where it counts.
McColl: That was crazy. It was the most fun baseball day, probably ever.

Cuffing season may be over, but it’s not too late to find your spring fling. Perhaps your latest eye candy has come out of the woodwork of the house or maybe you’re tired of pining over a longtime house crush. It’s time to make your move at Brain Break (i.e. what should be your nightly, house-wide mixer).
Here are some tried and true pick up lines to lay on the house hunny next time you’re beside them getting your cereal or leftover cheese cubes at Brain Break.
1) “If you’re looking for a snac(k), look no further.”
2) “Ugh, I hate it when they run out of bananas. But I sure find you very a-peeling.”
3) You: “Can you pass me a fork?”
*they hand you a fork*
You: “Thanks, but I’m really looking for a big/little spoon tonight.”
4) Alternatively, “Oh no, they’re out of forks. But that’s okay, I’m actually looking for a big/little spoon tonight.”
5) “You looking for some (Kashi) heart to heart this evening?”
6) “This brain break really sucks tonight. I can think of a different way to give your brain a break.”
7) “This brain break isn’t the only thing that looks like a mess but is actually pretty nice and cute.”
8) “I’m gonna make some toast.”
**Hold up bread by their face.**
“You’re so hot, you’re burning it.”
9) “Is your name bagel? Because you really are bae goals.”
10) “I’m sweeter than that HUDS cookie, and you better believe it”
These pick-up lines are the guaranteed perfect conversation starter for any dhall crush. Perhaps your crush will be flattered and wholeheartedly impressed by your wit and charm from these pick-up lines, thus landing yourself a housebae. On the other hand, maybe you will live the rest of your Harvard life trying to avoid awkward encounters with the person you tried these on. Regardless, even if these pickup lines fail, at least you’ll have gotten some kind of snack out of this ordeal.
