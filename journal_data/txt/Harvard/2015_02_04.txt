After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To jump or not to jump, that is the question.
At this point in my life I feel like a suitable metaphor is that of a tower—a skyscraper breaking through a canopy of clouds. On the lower levels sit arithmetic, basic algebra, reading comprehension, chapter books, middle-school crushes, graduations, calculus, papers, parties, graduations, first-jobs, transitions, office Christmas parties, suits, dark shoes, weddings, mortgages and somewhere up above there are boardrooms, penthouse suites, changing-worlds, and billion dollar deals being done.
The tower is typically represented by the word “institution.” The institutions we have grown up in, the institutions we are currently in. They house us, feed us, and keep the dirt off our feet. Within them we can rise.
This is a lesson I still don't fully appreciate—that the world has existed for much longer than any one of us has been alive and that most worthwhile terrain has been either built upon or claimed. This means firstly, that as we navigate the world we will inevitably encounter institutions with rich histories, thick walls, and vaults of knowledge. In many cases this is a good thing—it means that we can stand on the shoulders of giants, learn from those who have come before us, get our wheels manufactured in China for a fraction of the cost. I would in most cases, much rather find myself in the comfort of an air-conditioned building than out in the middle of a desert with sandy feet and coarse lungs flailing as I try to set up shelter. To get to Harvard we had to jump through a few hoops, do a few waggle dances, iron out a few essays, but nothing too strenuous—a non-lethal amount of bureaucracy in return for a generally magnanimous supreme leader. For the most part we have been treated well.
However, the tower is a Socratic argument. Each upward step is the most compelling of all the available options, but few make it to the destination without feeling jaded and destitute. The next stage is always knowable, predictable, safe; but at each stage one rubs shoulders with people who wished they had jumped sooner and not come up so high. Long ago, they could look over a windows edge and see a canopy to fall into and be caught. Now the distance is too much, the risk of a parachute not opening or a wire getting caught is too high. The floors are strewn, in dwindling numbers, with a mechanical ensemble, those who have never known what it is like to jump. At the very top, you are told, exist only the most distinguished of people—the rest either stagnate or fall, the atmosphere up there does not support mere mortals. The point is that all those who dream must jump at some point.
And for those who decide that they must jump, the only question that remains is one of timing.
Those who jump too soon, or too low in the institution, are children leaping off garden walls—ecstatic in their own bliss but with ideas that have not been tested against the best. Institutions like Harvard collect great minds together and help push us to places that our inward, free-thinking, adolescent selves cannot hope to go alone. Those who jump too soon never receive the training needed to thrive in any field. They have few mentors, little support, no yardsticks and sparse opportunities for growth. Jump too soon and mistimed rebellion will leave you resentful and scraping. You will be the man on the street corner, shouting how he “coulda been som'body!!” but ultimately has nothing to show for all his non-conformity.
For those who hold on too long, an even worse fate awaits. Those who hold on too long find their skin melding into the very institutions they are part of. Those who fail to jump while they still have a safety net beneath them end up like the protagonist in Coetzee's “Youth”—making small sacrifices here and small concessions there until not even the core of their person remains. Death by a thousand cuts. Congratulations.
Trusting institutional knowledge and pre-prescribed pathways is surely an act of humility. At any stage of life there is an infinite amount that is unknown, and trusting the knowledge of the past is therefore an intelligent thing to do. We berate our peers for taking “cushy” jobs in finance and consulting, citing that salaries, prestige and comfort are poor substitutes for the kind of fulfillment that they could—in theory—get by being less risk-averse and more trusting of their own resilience. These people, we feel, have so much habitualized jumping through hoops that the step from college-life to work-life feels like just another big round hula to step through. I suspect that many of them are just as confused as we are. They are unsure of whether now is the right time to jump. But we must all jump eventually, to learn how to fall, just in case we are one of the select few who can fly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Dartmouth College announced that it will ban hard alcohol from its campus in an effort to stop dangerous partying and combat the school’s problems with sexual assault. Fraternities are a particular target of this and other policy changes. As Dartmouth President Philip Hanlon explained, “Greek organizations . . . will be held to much higher standards and a far greater level of accountability than they have been before.” Dartmouth’s efforts to crack down on its notorious fraternity scene show a strong commitment towards reform;  banning hard alcohol, however, will not be an effective policy. Instead, Dartmouth should focus on educational policies, like its new, laudable four-year sexual assault prevention program, to create a continued campus dialogue on alcohol and related issues.
The connection between intoxication and sexual violence is well-established, as is the relationship between sexual violence and social organizations that depend upon skewed gender dynamics. As The Dartmouth has reported, nearly 57% of current undergraduates believe there is a positive correlation between Greek life and cases of sexual assault. And just over a year ago, the Department of Education investigated a civil rights complaint that claimed Dartmouth was not properly responding to instances of sexual violence. In light of this context, then, the educational program proposed by President Hanlon is commendable as a direct and serious response to an ongoing problem..
Yet as Casey Dennis, Dartmouth’s student body president, has said, the ban on hard alcohol will be difficult to implement successfully because “hard alcohol is usually kept in private places.” The administration may instead inadvertently drive such drinking underground, making the culture of consumption even more dangerous. Students may choose to drink in their dorms or other non-public locations, where their actions will be harder to monitor. As the editorial staff of The Dartmouth explained themselves: “If students want to get dangerously drunk, they will find a way to do so. Rhetoric about eliminating the epidemic of binge drinking is neither realistic nor helpful.”
Moreover, at least nine schools have similar bans, but many have found that there has been little meaningful change as far as alcohol-related hospitalizations. At Bates College, for example, where a ban has been in place since 2001, 44 students were still hospitalized for alcohol poisoning in 2010.
Instead of its proposed ban, Dartmouth and other universities hoping to combat issues of sexual violence and its relation to alcohol should look towards a policy of education. The  four-year program of sexual assault prevention education introduced alongside the hard alcohol ban, is an example of one such solution. Aiming to be a comprehensive and mandatory education program for all students, this program represents the best of Dartmouth’s policy changes.
As universities across the country work towards creating policies to eliminate sexual assault on college campuses, they must remember that blanket prohibitions of the kind announced by Dartmouth are rarely effective. More concerted efforts at education remains the most promising way to address alcohol abuse on college campuses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 4, 2015, at 1:02 p.m.
The Faculty Council dismissed two undergraduates from the College on Dec. 10 for sexual misconduct, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said at Tuesday's monthly meeting of the Faculty.
One of those students had been the subject of three harassment complaints, while the second student was the subject of one, according to Smith. Both have been notified of their dismissals, he said.
The cases were the last reviewed under the school’s former sexual harassment policy and procedures, Smith said. FAS's interim policy was replaced Monday when new FAS procedures were released, expanding Harvard's central sexual harassment investigation office's jurisdiction to include cases of alleged sexual harassment by faculty and staff.
The Faculty Council—the highest elected body of FAS—must approve recommendations by the College's Administrative Board to dismiss or expel a student, a decision reached only in the most serious cases of misconduct. Only another Faculty Council vote can readmit a student who has been dismissed from the College—a rare occurrence.
Following Smith's remarks, the Faculty voted unanimously for a new Ph.D. program in “Population Health Sciences," the only docketed item of the meeting, which ended after approximately 20 minutes.
The new program will combine five doctorate of science programs within the Harvard School of Public Health's departments of Environmental Health, Epidemiology, Global Health and Population, Nutrition, and Social and Behavioral Sciences into a single, Ph.D.-awarding program.
The topic of the Unviersity's new health benefits policy for non-union employees, a recurrent point of contention at Faculty meetings throughout the fall semester, also surfaced at Tuesday's meeting.
University President Drew G. Faust said her office is currently compiling data on health care expenditures at Harvard. This statement came three months after FAS professors unanimously called upon Faust at their November meeting to repeal changes to health benefits plans. Faust said she will distribute the information later this week to faculty members who had raised concerns and that the data will also be published on the Harvard Information for Employees website.
As part of a series of measures Faust announced in November in response to the Faculty's vote, administrators will hold information sessions in Longwood and in Cambridge in which members of the University Benefits Committee—the group that recommended the changes to the health benefits plan—will solicit feedback from the community on the changes.
During the question period of the meeting, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 asked Faust about a statement she gave to The Crimson in early December addressing grand jury decisions not to indict two white police officers who had killed unarmed black men on separate occasions.
Mansfield said the University should “be wary of reacting to events” and specifically pointed to controversies in Ferguson, Mo., and New York this summer, as well as the subsequent shooting of two police officers in New York.
In response, Faust said that issues of race and justice were central to her life as a scholar of the Civil War and a participant in the Selma marches of 1965, adding that all lives matter.
“You would see I was not making a judgment on the outcome of any particular adjudication of an issue,” she said. “I was rather talking about the great pain that is felt across the country because of the sense of injustice that prevails across our land.”
Her response was met with loud applause.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: February 4, 2015
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a vote of the Faculty is required to readmit a student after dismissal. In fact, a vote of the Faculty Council, but not the full Faculty, is required. Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article also incorrectly stated that the Faculty Council is the highest government body of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In fact, it is the highest elected body.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge renters and homeowners, as well as numerous neighborhood development groups, gathered Saturday at a forum hosted by the Cambridge Residents Alliance to discuss community concerns related to affordable housing and gentrification.
Longtime Cambridge resident Barbara Taggart, who has lived in the city since 1977, shared her observations of the many middle- and low-income residents who have been priced out of the area.
“It was a working class neighborhood back then, and it was diverse,” she said. “That, we’ve lost over the years.”
Taggart, 72, who used to own a local plumbing business, said she has seen approximately a quarter of her clients displaced out of Cambridge and into the suburbs.
According to Jan Devereux, a resident activist who said she plans to run for Cambridge City Council, the forum was a way for residents to better understand housing development and growth policies and to push for government action.
“We were asking how can residents effectively lobby and how city council and other stakeholders can be more proactive to put policies in place to incentivize building housing that is considered to be affordable to low-income people,” Devereux said.
In addition to calling for affordable housing in the future, attendees of the forum also discussed how the city government can better respond to residents’ current housing concerns and how to hold officials more accountable.
Along with  longtime Cambridge renters and homeowners, two newly-elected city council members, Dennis J. Carlone and Nadeem A. Mazen, attended the event.
Mazen said, “A lot of people are looking at the bigger picture by considering both state and federal spending and how we can make decisions about housing and equity.”
According to Jonathan King, the co-chair of the Cambridge Residents Alliance, the event’s organizers believe that governing bodies—including the city manager, the city council, and the planning board—acting in the interests of large developers rather than those of Cambridge residents have led to the high cost of housing.
In addition to members of the Cambridge Residents Alliance, members of the Fresh Pond Residents Alliance, Area 4 Coalition, and the Neighborhood Association of East Cambridge attended the forum.
King said that the Cambridge Residents Alliance expects to host another forum in the spring to discuss other residential issues such as flooding, air pollution, and traffic.

Responding to news that Dartmouth will soon implement a ban on hard alcohol on campus, Harvard administrators and national experts on alcohol safety said that while they were unsurprised by the new policy at Dartmouth, they expect the changes to have little effect on Harvard College’s recently revised approach to policing alcohol.
In 2012, the same year that Dartmouth grappled with a hazing scandal, Harvard College adopted a new set of alcohol policies. The policies standardized how the Houses serve and police alcohol, reintroducing hard liquor to House formals in the form of mixed drinks and adopting regulations of private student parties on campus.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who sits on the Office of Alcohol and Other Drugs Services executive committee, said he understands the reasoning behind the changes at Dartmouth, citing safety issues related to pre-gaming and hard alcohol. But he does not know of an immediate push to change current policy at Harvard, he said.
“More and more schools are clamping down on the use and abuse of alcohol,” Dingman said. “We’re aware of [the other schools], but you have to decide what’s best for your own institution, and many schools just have a different ethos.”
Eliot House Co-Master Gail A. O’Keefe, who sat on the committee that wrote Harvard’s current alcohol policies, similarly said she understands Dartmouth’s decision, but said she feels that Harvard does not need any additional policy changes as of yet.
“The [current] policy seems very easy,” O’Keefe said. “We have not had any students push back.”
Although Harvard and Dartmouth have both geography and the Ivy League in common, there are important factors that distinguish them, outside higher education experts said. Individual institutions, they added, must focus on researching their own cultures and specific factors that would affect alcohol safety.
Noting one such factor, Matt Gregory, outgoing president of the Association for Student Conduct Administration, said Harvard’s urban campus in Cambridge would make a ban on hard alcohol much less effective than it might be at Dartmouth’s location in the smaller town of Hanover. He said there are fewer opportunities for Dartmouth students to “go out into the community and engage in what could be called risky behavior” off campus.
Gregory also said that the two schools' relations with Greek life mark an important difference. Dartmouth houses fraternities on campus, while Harvard does not recognize many off-campus social organizations.
Other experts cautioned against schools’ flatly incorporating the approaches of other institutions without first examining their own specific policies and culture.
“There may be an error in adopting the specific points and transferring those points to other campuses, because what you really want to do is do campus-specific strategic planning,” said Dan Reilly, a prevention and research coordinator at the University of Missouri’s Partners in Prevention, a consortium of Missouri colleges focused on preventing students’ high-risk and underage drinking.
Still, both Reilly and Gregory pointed to Dartmouth as an example of how schools can utilize community outreach before enacting significant policy changes.
While Harvard College leaders, meanwhile, say they are attuned to the changes underway at Dartmouth, some administrators reiterated that they feel confident in Harvard’s approach to alcohol. “Our approach is a multifaceted one involving peer education, counseling, policy and programming," Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in an email.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who chaired the committee that crafted the current College alcohol policies, wrote in an email that the College has continued to work on a “multifaceted approach to addressing issues around alcohol.”

Panelists discussing the “Black Lives Matter” campaign underscored the importance of implementing policy changes among police forces and acknowledged the struggle to increase public consciousness of systemic racism at the semester’s first meeting of the Harvard College Democrats Tuesday.
Panelist Nashwa Y. Gewaily, a legal fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, spoke at length about recommendations the American Civil Liberties Union sent to the Boston Police Department last October in the wake of the controversial grand jury rulings in Ferguson, Mo., and Staten Island, N.Y.
Gewaily—who has worked on a range of advocacy issues at both the policy-making and grassroots level—said that one proposal, body cameras, would reduce the number of violent interactions between police officers and civilians. She added that effective policy-making could address privacy concerns.
Temitope A. Agabalogun ’15, the other panelist at the event and a member of the Harvard Black Students Association, agreed that body cameras would be an important first step.
“I hope this opens up a wider discussion on policing and what we expect from officers, what we expect from an interaction between an officer and a civilian,” he said.
The other recommendations discussed included a statewide system of data collection on police stops and “civilian receipts,” which would provide information to all individuals stopped by an officer about their rights and how to file a complaint about police mistreatment. These recommendations, Gewaily said, address three core issues facing police departments: “accountability, transparency, and constitutionality.”
Remembering the announcement of the grand jury’s non-indictment in Ferguson, Agabalogun recalled his surprise at what he called the “apathy” of other students when he first heard the verdict while he was with a friend in Quincy dining hall.
“Everyone else was just reading through what they had to do, talking, joking,” he said. “We seemed to be the only people that were caring about it in the dhall.”
After the meeting, Harvard Democrats President Jacob R. Carrel ’16 said that he hoped the event would bring greater attention to the issues of injustice that he called crucial matters for students to consider.
“There are always examples of injustice wherever we look, and though we can’t always fix those injustices, we can try to make everyone know about them,” he said.

Second-year Harvard Law School student and government Ph.D. candidate Jonathan S. Gould ’10 has been elected the 129th president of the Harvard Law Review, a student-run legal journal independent from the Law School. Gould succeeds third-year law student Rachel G. Miller-Ziegler.
Gould hails from Newton, Mass. and studied Social Studies at Harvard as an undergraduate. The Law School posted an announcement of the election on Tuesday night.
Both Gould and Miller-Ziegler expressed optimism for the future of the law journal in statements on the Law School website.
“The Law Review is exceptionally fortunate to have Jon as its president,” Miller-Ziegler said in the statement. “Jon’s formidable intellect, infectious love for the law, and incomparable work ethic earned the deep respect of his peers, and his kindness and generosity have made him an admired member of the Law Review community. Jon will make an outstanding president, and I look forward to watching him lead the Review in the year ahead.”
For his part, Gould said he looked forward to a year at the helm of the organization and expressed gratitude for his predecessor’s leadership.
“Rachel has been a phenomenal leader,” Gould said. “Her brilliant legal mind, natural leadership qualities, and tireless dedication to the Law Review have inspired all of us. The Law Review is a better journal and stronger community for her leadership. Together with all of our editors, I look forward to continuing the Law Review’s tradition of excellence in legal scholarship in the coming year.”
Past editors of Harvard Law Review include U.S. President Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the organization, and a number of sitting Supreme Court Justices, including Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. ’76.
A student-run organization, some have criticized the role young law school students play in shaping the discourse of legal scholarship. In recent years, the Law Review has focused on its online presence, doubling the number of online editors.
Both Miller-Ziegler and Gould were not available for comment by press time.

Nearly four months after launching a petition to include an affirmative consent clause in Harvard's sexual harassment policy, student activists say they will shift their focus to more actively push to ensure that the policy is clear and properly implemented, rather than only argue for its strict inclusion of affirmative consent.
When Harvard unveiled its new University-wide sexual harassment policy last year, members of Our Harvard Can Do Better, an undergraduate activist group, criticized its lack of an explicit affirmative consent clause, which would require that parties actively communicate their willingness to participate in sexual activity.
Last September, University Title IX officer Mia Karvonides defended Harvard's policy, arguing that the University’s current approach is “nuanced” and achieves the same ends as an affirmative consent standard. Still, three student advocacy groups—Our Harvard Can Do Better and two graduate student organizations—co-sponsored an online petition, launched in October, calling for the adoption of affirmative consent.
Rory Gerberg, a student at the Kennedy School of Government who co-organizes one of the graduate student coalitions that designed the petition, said it received about 500 signatures in total from “pretty minimal efforts.”
But Gerberg said that since the petition launched, the organizers’ priorities have “shifted,” referencing a letter criticizing Harvard's policy that 28 Harvard Law School professors published in The Boston Globe shortly after the petition launched. Since that time, Gerberg said the group has met with various administrators and professors, still using the “norms” affirmative consent embodies as a guiding force.
“We’re not pushing for [the petition] as actively as we were in the fall because what we’re doing now is engaging more in educational outreach events and pushing for more training,” said MaryRose Mazzola, another organizer and a Kennedy School student.
Organizers for Our Harvard Can Do Better, meanwhile, say the group will focus on ensuring that the current policy is clear and will indeed accomplish the same ends as affirmative consent, even if it does not include an explicit clause.
“If they’re going to insist on using this language that they’ve chosen and insist on saying that it is serving the same function as affirmative consent, I think it’s very important for me to make sure we’re holding them to that standard,” said Emily M. Fox-Penner ’17, an organizer for Our Harvard Can Do Better.

HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 3
After ending the fall semester with a 1-3 record, No. 6 ranked Harvard men’s squash team (6-2, 5-0 Ivy) came back this semester with five straight wins against competitors ranked in the top-11 in the nation. At the Murr Center this Sunday, the Crimson took on a top-three Ivy team and won in a 6-3 upset.
“I suspect [Columbia] was thinking they would come away with a victory,” Harvard coach Michael Way said. “And you can’t blame them for thinking that when they have a strong team.”
No. 3 Columbia came out strong with two 3-0 sweeps by the Lions’ senior Ramit Tandon and freshman Osama Khalifa in the top two ladder spots.  However, Harvard was able to hold onto all but one of the next seven matches.
“Columbia was really our biggest challenge of 2015,” captain Tyler Olson said. “I would say it’s our biggest win of the year. We knew that there were going to be some matches at the top of the ladder that would be tough to win, and that we needed to win one or two of those.”
Those two Crimson wins came at the number three and four seeds. Freshman Bradley Smith improved his record to 3-0 at the number three spot with a hard-fought five-game win. Sophomore Bryan Koh won another close match, 3-1, playing at the fourth spot.
“Bradley Smith had an outstanding match. It’s tough for freshmen to get their heads around the mental challenges of the game,” Way said. “Usually they will toughen up a lot more by junior year, but it’s not often you see freshmen doing that.”
Freshman Seif Eleinen, after recovering recently from a back injury, gained his second win at the ninth position in three games. Classmate David Ryan won his match, 3-1, despite having to sit out because of illness in Saturday’s contest.
“We graduated five seniors last year out of our top nine,” Olson said. “Luckily we’ve had these freshmen come in and be very strong performers. They all played really well, and have stepped up to fill the gap that would have been there otherwise.”
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 2
In Saturday’s contest, Harvard took down No. 7 Cornell with only two losses. Both freshman Madhav Dhingra and junior Matt Roberts fell to Cornell players, 3-0.
“With respect to the Cornell team, we are a little stronger than they are with the exception of their number one player, who is phenomenal,” Way said. “Apart from that, I thought the team was very workman-like in its approach to the games and it turned out very well.”
Olson lost his first game of the match, and fought hard to win the next three as the seventh ladder spot. He remains undefeated in this season. In the six other contests, the Crimson’s players swept their Big Red opponents in three games.
On Friday afternoon, the Crimson will be competing against the No. 5 Yale (8-3, 3-1 Ivy) in a game that significantly affects Harvard’s chances at winning Ivy League champion title.
After having defeated University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, and Dartmouth in recent competitions, this past weekend’s two victories place Harvard at the top of the Ivy rankings. If the Crimson defeats the Bulldogs, it will only have to defeat Brown to clinch the championship for the third consecutive year. The Bears are ranked far below their Ivy competitors, making Harvard’s contest against Yale the matchup that would most likely determine who wins the conference.
“With respect to Brown, they are not one of the strongest teams in the league,” Way said. “On paper, we are much stronger than them. It would be likely that we would win the Ivy title if we can get through Yale, but they are a very strong team and Friday night will be an awesome match.”
At the Ivy Scrimmages this past season, the Crimson suffered a tough 6-3 loss to the Bulldogs. Yale went on to defeat Columbia, 5-4, in the same weekend, to place first in the tournament. However, in the Bulldogs’ official contest against the Lions, Columbia came out on top by one match.  After Harvard’s upset against the Lions this weekend, this next match could favor the Crimson more than Yale had anticipated.
“Right now, we’re ranked below Yale,” Olson said. “But we’re confident that we’re stronger than them. Obviously anything can happen on match day, but we’re hoping that we can beat them on our home court.”

BOSTON—For the No. 6/6 Harvard men’s hockey team, the goal was clear: bend, don’t break. It bent for 63 shots from No. 3/2 Boston University, but the 64th was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
The Crimson held off the Terriers for 82 minutes, but a turnover in the defensive zone by Harvard led to junior forward Danny O’Regan getting open in the crease and delivering the final blow.
“Our guys battled,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It was a game with a lot of momentum changes. Obviously we’re frustrated…but I was proud of the way our guys played.”
MICHALEK SETS BEANPOT RECORD
Even though BU (17-4-4, 11-2-2 Hockey East) prevailed at the end of the 82-minute contest, junior goaltender Steve Michalek stole the show on Tuesday night. The third-year player registered 63 saves on the night, easily breaking the previous record of 52 saves which was set in 1970 by Boston College goalie Jim Barton.
“I thought I did my job,” Michalek said. “I thought everyone did a great job up and down defensively.  We had numerous block shots on Grade-A opportunities that I thought was the difference in the game.”
The Minnesota Wild prospect also broke the Harvard (12-6-2, 8-4-2 ECAC) school record for saves, which was previously held by Grant Blair ’86 in a performance against BC in 1984.
CRIMSON BEANPOT REVIVAL
Despite the end result of the game, Harvard faired much better this season than in recent first round appearances at the Beanpot. The Crimson had lost its previous five first round games by a combined score of 17-2. Last year was the team’s nadir in the Beanpot this century, as Harvard racked up 16 penalties en route a 6-0 defeat at the hands of Northeastern.
This year was different, as the Crimson went toe-to-toe with a top three team in the nation and taking a two-goal lead midway through the second period. Even though the team did not advance, this year’s performance was a notable improvement over past years.
“I think this is the first time that we’ve had [sophomore Alexander] Kerfoot and [Sean] Malone,” Donato said. “We still have a few guys out that we’re looking to get back soon…This last month of the season is critical. We’re not looking too far ahead.”
However, a favorable trend for the Crimson reversed last night. Harvard had won five straight games against BU coming into the Beanpot, including an overtime win earlier this year. The Crimson didn’t make it easy for BU, but the Terriers finally snapped their losing streak with a dramatic double-OT win.
LAST BEANPOT FOR BROTHERS
This year marked the third year that brothers junior forward Danny of BU and Harvard senior forward Tommy O’Regan faced off against each other in the Beanpot and the sixth time that the Crimson and the Terriers have faced off while both the Needham, Mass. natives have been on the teams. Danny made it a memorable one.
“I guess I saved the best for last,” the younger O’Regan said. “It was a great game and I’m really excited to get to a Beanpot final….It happened to be against my brother which I won’t try to bring up too much at home.”
The Terrier notched the final goal for BU to help his team advance to the championship game for the first time in his tenure. The former Roxbury Latin star leads the Terriers with 17 goals on the season.
After having played only four games this season, the elder O’Regan started on Harvard’s second line in his last opening round game of the Beanpot. With the score tied 3-3, Tommy found open ice around the left face-off circle and fired past goaltender Matt O’Connor, but the puck ricocheted off the crossbar and into the netting, which kept the game knotted at three goals apiece. He also was trailing sophomore Tyler Moy on a breakaway and positioned for a rebound, but Moy was unable to launch a shot on net.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 37th showing of the Beanpot, the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s hockey team hosted No. 6/6 Boston University on Tuesday night at Bright-Landry Hockey Center to battle for bragging rights in the first round of the crosstown classic.
After failing to score against Princeton the last time the team took the ice, the Crimson (16-4-2, 12-3-1 ECAC) came out with a strong offensive front against the Terriers (17-7-2, 12-4-0 Hockey East), never trailing in the game en route to a 9-2 win. The win tied the highest number of goals scored by Harvard in the past seven seasons. Over the course of the game the team saw tallies come from the sticks of eight different players, a season high.
The Crimson set the pace of the faceoff early; scoring its first goal with only 34 seconds elapsed on the game clock. The score came from the stick of sophomore forward Sydney Daniels who was assisted by senior forwards Lyndsey Fry and Kalley Armstrong.
Fry then recorded a score of her own at the 13:40 mark of the opening period. Breaking away from the pack off a steal by Daniels, Fry dribbled the puck and was able to get her shot past the BU goaltender.
“Obviously it was really a fun night for our team and I was impressed by how we started and finished,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We had talked about staying in the moment and playing every shift like it’s your last and I think our kids really bought into that right off the bat tonight.”
Harvard did not let up on its scoring effort in the second period, recording six goals in the next 20 minutes of play.
No more than a minute after junior forward Mary Parker scored the Crimson’s third goal, Harvard struck again, this time from senior forward Hillary Crowe, who muscled the puck past the goal line off assists from junior Miye D’Oench and senior Sami Reber. Crowe ended the night with two goals and an assist.
“I thought every line did a good job of shooting through the screen,” Crowe said. “Personally I have a tendency to wait for the pass and today on my first goal I saw an opening to shoot through the screen and found the back of the net. I know that’s been a goal of mine personally and I’ve practiced it a lot.”
BU attempted to tighten the gap at with a goal midway through the second frame, but Harvard answered the challenge almost immediately when freshman Dani Krzyszczyk recorded her first goal of the season off an assist by classmate Haley Mullins. Junior forward Jessica Harvey added her first goal of the season to the effort as well just two minutes later, making the score 7-1.
Terrier sophomore goalie Victoria Hanson was responsible for all seven of the Crimson’s goals in the first two periods before freshman Erin O’Neil took over between the posts to finish out the final 20 minutes of ice time.
The switch didn’t seem to help the defensive effort for long, as the puck crossed the goal line once more when Mullins shoveled a pass to Harvey who was waiting in front of the goal to convert the pass into a point.
Harvard also replaced starting goalie junior Emerance Maschmeyer with sophomore Brianna Laing to finish out the third period. BU freshman forward Victoria Bach was able to sneak a goal by Laing in the closing minutes of the game, putting the cap on all scoring for the night. Combined, the two goalies were able to make 12 saves.
With the win, the Crimson advance to the championship game of the Beanpot for the first time since the 2010-2011 season.
“To be going into the Beanpot final is an honor,” Daniels said. “We are just going to play our hearts out and we’re very excited to have the chance to win it all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Midway through the second period of the 63rd annual Beanpot, the No. 6/6 Harvard men’s ice hockey team (12-6-2, 8-4-2 ECAC) had hit its stride. Goals from sophomore forwards Alex Kerfoot and Sean Malone in their long awaited returns had the Crimson up 3-1 and on the verge of its first championship appearance since 2008.
But two unanswered Boston University goals later, the score was level again. And after an ensuing 42-minute stalemate, the No. 3/2 Terriers (17-4-4, 11-2-2 Hockey East) found the breakthrough they needed 2:18 into double overtime to come away with a 4-3 victory.
BU forward Evan Rodrigues helped put an end to the instant classic, picking off junior forward Kyle Criscuolo and charging up the left wing. From his backhand, Rodrigues centered a pass for junior forward Danny O’Regan in the slot, and the Needham, Mass., native pushed the puck past junior goaltender Steve Michalek to send the Terrier bench into a frenzy.
“Definitely a special feeling,” O’Regan said. “I was 0-for-my-first-5 [against brother Tommy O'Regan], but this was probably the biggest one.”
O’Regan’s shot was one of very few to escape the grasp of Michalek, who finished the game with a career high—and Beanpot record—63 saves.
The junior made his biggest stop of the game, and perhaps the season, four minutes into the first overtime period. Rookie phenom Jack Eichel delivered a pass across the crease to Rodrigues, but Michalek sprawled to his left to deny him on the doorstep.
Michalek stopped 18 shots in the first overtime period alone. BU had several additional chances as well, ringing two posts less than a minute apart and having a shot blocked by junior defenseman Brayden Jaw on Michalek’s right post.
Despite the Terriers’ advantage in the shot count, sophomore forward Tyler Moy had a golden opportunity to end the game in the first added frame. Much like the overtime breakaway junior forward Jimmy Vesey had at BU in November, Moy entered the Terrier zone with no one to beat but goaltender Matt O’Connor. But upon entering the slot, the sophomore lost control of the puck, ending the threat.
“We needed to be opportunistic and finish a couple of the outnumbered rushes,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “It looked to me like we ran out of gas a little bit.”
One period after Malone put the team on his back with an unassisted goal to make it 3-1, the Crimson nearly avoided overtime altogether by putting the puck on his back.
After O’Connor failed to corral a shot from rookie Jake Horton, Malone crashed the net, going flying into the BU netminder. Looking to clean up the mess, freshman Seb Lloyd lifted a shot that landed on the back of Malone, which appeared to be positioned over the goal line. But after a review, the referees signaled no goal, maintaining that there was inconclusive evidence to overturn the call, rather than goaltender interference.
“The magic of technology has shown that it did go in,” Donato said. “So I’m sure that’s a little bit frustrating for everybody.”
The three pucks that did cross the line for the Crimson came over the first two periods. One minute after senior forward Cason Hohmann opened the scoring for the Terriers, Harvard’s first line responded. Extending his point streak to 20 games, junior forward Jimmy Vesey assisted classmate Kyle Criscuolo’s score on the doorstep with 1:55 remaining in the first period.
In their return to the ice, Kerfoot and Malone tacked on two more to open up a 3-1 second period lead. In the first minute of the frame, Criscuolo took a failed BU clear and threw it in front for Kerfoot, who pushed it past O’Connor for his first goal since November 11. Malone’s score followed eight minutes later.
But the Terriers were unfazed. Rookie forward Nikolas Olsson cut the lead in half with 4:26 to go in the period, and junior forward Ahti Oksanen provided a top shelf equalizer in the final minute.
The two goals came over a 20-minute stretch where BU outshot the Crimson, 20-0. But Michalek kept Harvard in the game with a number of timely saves throughout the contest before ultimately surrendering the game-winner to O’Regan.
With the win, the Terriers snapped a five-game losing streak to the Crimson. They will take on Northeastern in the championship game Monday, while Harvard awaits No. 11/12 Boston College in the consolation game.

Happy hump day! And, if you’re anything like me, happy actual last chance to hand in your study card day!

The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, usually doesn't produce actually funny content. Or any content in general.
But wait– wasn’t Conan in The Lampoon? Aren’t their comp posters witty? Doesn’t their website say that they publish lightning-quick, joke-heavy “kind-of-stories” that are so hilarious as to be a medical risk for some? All true. However, take the time to read something from their most recent issue “By any means necessary,” and you’ll find the real Lampoon.
This post isn’t about putting down the Lampoon, it’s about patting them on the back. Why? Because they just published a decent attempt at humor! That’s right, I’m talking about their annual spoof on The Crimson.
If you didn’t get the print issue, then you can see all of their fake articles on thecrimsom.com. And if you’re short of time then here’s a Tl;dr for you– you won’t think it’s funny unless you spend most of your time in a castle.
The Banner Ad: Congratulations to the Lampoon for selling an ad on their fake website. Readers will notice that it is for alcohol and should assume that the Lampoon was paid in kind.
The Article Comments: In an allusion to the eclectic mix of people who comment on Crimson articles, the Lampoon does a nice job of posting faking comments. They’re exactly the same for every article, so funny!
Photos: I’m really impressed with the multimedia work it took to photoshop a BCG logo onto a gingerbread house or an Olympic stadium into Harvard Yard.
The Most Read List: Solid idea to link them all to pop-ups. I was really disappointed not to be able to read the Gato Rojo story though #upset #tears #teamcats
Lampoon Comp Ad: Terrible.

In the long list of venerated visitors that come almost daily to this campus, one is noticeably missing: Raven Symone. Fortunately, there’s a movement in the works to bring this issue to light: the “Bring Raven Symone to Harvard University” Facebook page, which currently boasts over 3,000 likes. The actress, most known for her role in the hit Disney television show “That’s So Raven” or her performances in the films Cheetah Girls and Cheetah Girls 2 (and a voice as Monique in the animated series Kim Possible), has never come to Harvard on an official visit. Her last album, provocatively titled Raven-Symone, was released in 2008, though she’s best known for singles like “That’s What Little Girls are Made Of” (which charted number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 1993) or “Cheetah Sisters.” She has long since been an American icon, yet has never been invited officially as a guest to our school. 
As the “About” section on the Facebook page explains, “This page was created for the sole purpose of bringing Raven Symone to Harvard University . . . we just want Raven to come to Harvard now, so she can instill an ounce of Cheetah-liciousness within us and apologize for Corey in the House.” The page also features photoshopped images of Raven at different places on Harvard’s campus, including standing in front of Widener Library and posing in the Yard. With the announcements about Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year and the subsequent visit of Amy Poehler to our campus last week, the page lamented, “Once again, the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 chose not to name Raven-Symone as its Woman of the Year . . . we promise to remain diligent in our fight to bring Raven-Symone to this campus.”
So what do you think? Do you support the movement to bring Raven back?
