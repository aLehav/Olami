After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team fell seconds short of a long-overdue sweep yet provided a strong statement in the season’s first weekend double.
In upstate New York, the Crimson shut out RPI, 4-0, on Friday before tying defending national champion Union, 2-2, on Saturday. A last-minute goal from freshman Dutchman forward Spencer Foo prevented Harvard (1-0-2, 1-0-2 ECAC) from securing its first pair of road wins on consecutive nights since January 2007.
“I think the takeaway overall is that it’s a pretty solid weekend,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think we improved as a team over the weekend.”
Junior forwards Jimmy Vesey and Brian Hart combined for five of the Crimson’s goals while junior netminder Steve Michalek made 56 stops over 125 minutes of play.
HARVARD 2, UNION 2
Foo scored with 45 seconds left in regulation to complete a two-goal comeback for No. 8 Union (5-4-1, 0-3-1) and force overtime in Schenectady, N.Y. Both teams had strong chances to clinch the game in the extra frame but settled for one point apiece in the conference standings.
Michalek finished with 42 saves, one short of his career high.  His 42nd save was a web gem that denied Union sophomore forward Mike Vecchione on a point-blank opportunity with 11 seconds left in overtime.
“Steve had an unbelievable weekend,” Vesey said. “For us to be a good team, we’re going to have to rely on him a lot, and it’s good to see him playing well already.”
Harvard outshot the hosts, 14-3, in the first period and commanded the opening minutes of play. Vesey put back a rebound off a deflected shot from sophomore line mate Alex Kerfoot to put the Crimson up one just over three minutes into the game. Hart added to the lead at 10:44 in the period with a deflection of an outside shot from junior defenseman Desmond Bergin.
Union, which entered the night on a four-game losing streak, regained national champion-form after the first break. Dutchman senior Max Novak halved the Crimson lead just over a minute into the second period with a doorstep marker.
“I think they probably got chewed out a little bit by their coach in between periods and just came out with a lot more speed and tenacity,” Vesey said.
Union proceeded to outshoot Harvard, 34-14, over the final two frames of regulation.
In overtime, Kerfoot nearly capitalized on a shorthanded breakaway. A boarding penalty by sophomore Luke Esposito forced Harvard to skate a man down for the final 1:56 of the game.
“[This game] is a learning moment for us,” Donato said. “Taking three out of four points against two pretty good teams is something to build upon.”
HARVARD 4, RPI 0
Vesey scored twice on the power play, and an aggressive Harvard forecheck limited the Engineers (4-6-0, 3-1-0) to only 14 shots on goal Friday night in Troy, N.Y.
“We did a lot of good things offensively,” Donato said. “[The team] really controlled the play on both ends of the rink.”
Michalek recorded his third career shutout while Hart and sophomore Luke Esposito added a goal apiece on the second line.
Vesey struck first with just over a minute and a half left in the first period. In a back-and-forth exchange, the junior forward one-timed a quick feed in the slot from sophomore line mate Alex Kerfoot to beat RPI goaltender Jason Kasdorf stick-side.
Despite leading the team in goals last year, Vesey had been held scoreless in his last eight games.
“I think [scoring early] was kind of a relief and allowed me to play more relaxed out there,” Vesey said.
Harvard carried the energy of the breakthrough into a dominant final two frames.
Hart faked out Kasdorf from behind the net to put the Crimson up a pair with a sneaky wrap-around at 10:09 in the second period. Four minutes later, Vesey stuffed in his second goal past a scrum in the crease to put Harvard up three.
The Crimson quickly deflated any hopes for a change of pace for the Engineers in the third. Hart found Esposito for a fourth strike just over a minute into the last period.
“We played very much to our identity,” Vesey said. “We played with a lot of speed and let our skills take over. We totally swarmed RPI, and I thought all four goals were really nice plays.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia quarterback Trevor McDonagh may have nightmares tonight of Harvard linebackers.
Coming into Saturday’s matchup with the Lions (0-8, 0-5 Ivy), Harvard (8-0, 5-0) had yet to score a defensive touchdown on the season. With nine minutes left in the third quarter, the Crimson had three pick-sixes—all off McDonagh—and might have had a fourth defensive touchdown had sophomore linebacker Eric Ryan not fallen just shy of the end zone after picking up a fumble.
“I’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve never been in a game like that, 28 points directly off turnovers without any transition in between,” Columbia coach Pete Mangurian said. “Obviously it changes the whole complexion of the game…. We just didn’t execute and they ran it back in for scores and that changes everything.”
Even without starting quarterback Conner Hempel, the Crimson, powered by a dominant defense, handily defeated the Lions at home, 45-0, to remain atop the Ivy League. Harvard, which handed the Lions their first shutout of the year, has now held Columbia scoreless for the last three years.
While the offense struggled to mesh early on, the defense took charge. Crimson senior defensive end Zack Hodges, who leads the program in career sacks, went down on the first play of the game and sat out most of the first quarter. But Harvard’s defense didn’t need Hodges.
On Columbia’s second drive, McDonagh targeted receiver Ryan Flannery. But junior linebacker Eric Medes collided with Flannery, popping the ball up, and senior linebacker Connor Sheehan was right there to catch it and take it 48 yards back for Harvard’s first touchdown of the day.
McDonagh’s bad luck with Harvard’s linebackers didn’t end there—two possessions later, junior linebacker Matt Koran picked off the signal caller and ran it back 34 yards for McDonagh’s second pick-six of the day, putting Harvard up by 14.
Then, on the Lions’ opening drive of the second half, McDonagh’s pass again ended up in Sheehan’s hands, and the senior ended up in the end zone for the second time that afternoon. Sheehan’s 49-yard return gave Harvard a 42-point lead.
Following the interception, Mangurian pulled McDonagh in favor of freshman quarterback Anders Hill. The Lions came closest to scoring on Hill’s first drive of the game—Hill moved the squad down inside the Harvard 10-yard line, but junior defensive back Asante Gibson broke up a pass on the goal line to keep the shutout streak alive.
With a fumble recovery by Ryan in the second quarter, another by senior defensive back Ryan Jones, and a pick on Hill by rookie defensive back Tim Haehl, the defensive unit recorded six takeaways on the day, its highest total of the season. Jones also blocked a punt, but the Crimson couldn’t convert the opportunity into points when kicker Andrew Flesher’s 24-yard field goal attempt hooked wide left.
“We’re playing great team defense,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We rarely make mistakes, which is the most important thing. We play extremely hard. It’s a very, very close unit, a very close team. Because of that it’s really been a special team defensively. Clearly we’ve got a lot of football left to play, but clearly our identity, if you have to choose one identity as a team, is we’re a great defensive team right now.”
Columbia won the time of possession battle by nearly 15 minutes but had almost 200 yards fewer of total offense and punted the ball eight times on the day.
Hempel hurt his shoulder last weekend against Dartmouth and was not dressed Saturday, leaving junior Scott Hosch to start under center. Hosch and company were unable to get into a rhythm through the majority of the opening two quarters and could not put together a scoring drive until one minute remained in the half, when it took the Crimson just two plays to find the end zone.
Junior running back Paul Stanton broke free for a 37-yard dash, and Hosch threw a bullet to senior wideout Seitu Smith to extend the lead to 28.
Harvard’s offense came out strong after halftime, scoring on its first two possessions. Sophomore quarterback Joseph Viviano III got his first significant minutes of the season when Murphy elected to replace Hosch with Viviano after Harvard increased its lead to 35. Viviano drove the team all the way down to the Columbia four-yard line and demonstrated his mobility with a 53-yard scramble, but the quarterback coughed up the ball inside the Lions’ five to lose possession.
With senior running back Andrew Casten out with injury as well, freshman running back Semar Smith shouldered carries alongside Stanton. Smith recorded 112 rushing yards as well as his first collegiate touchdown.
Early in the second half, Columbia attempted a lateral pass deep in its own territory, but the errant toss fell to the ground, and Ryan was there to scoop it up and take it to the Lions’ one-yard line. One play later, Stanton punched it in to give the home team a three-score lead.
