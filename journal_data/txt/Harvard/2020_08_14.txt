After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences developed a portable, injectable blood clotting agent which has demonstrated high efficacy in preliminary trials with mice models.
The novel hemostat — dubbed HAPPI, or Hemostatic Agents via Polymer Peptide Interfusion — reduced bleeding time by 99 percent and overall blood loss by 97 percent in mice models, according to a paper published in Science Advances last month. It can be stored at room temperature for several months prior to being reconstituted with saline and then intravenously injected in patients.
Bioengineering professor Samir S. Mitragotri, the senior author of the paper, said in an interview that a critical motivation for developing the new hemostat is the gap that occurs between the time of injury and the time of treatment for trauma patients at hospitals.
“Many trauma deaths arising from blood loss occur in the first hour of the trauma — the so-called golden hour,” Mitragotri said. “We sought to develop an easily storable agent that the emergency care providers can carry with them and inject in patients on site to reduce blood loss and save lives.”
SEAS researchers developed HAPPI in collaboration with scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Case Western Reserve University. First author of the study and postdoctoral fellow Yongsheng Gao described the hemostat as having the consistency of “cotton candy” when kept freeze-dried for storage.
“Intravenous injectable, easy synthesis and storage, and the availability for first responders are the defining characteristics,” Gao said.
He added that biomimicry was key to the new hemostatic agent’s design.
“Platelets are the key players in the natural hemostasis process,” Gao said. “They are constantly circulating in our blood and once they find a vascular injury, they will activate, attach to the injury site and form a platelet plug to stop the bleeding.
Mitragotri characterized HAPPI as “enhancing the efficacy of the natural process of hemostasis by working with activated platelets.”
“Our hemostatic agent binds to activated platelets as well as the damage sites on the blood vessels,” Mitragotri said. “This leads to the recruitment of platelets to the site of the damage. By recruiting more activated platelets to the site of trauma, the clotting process can be accelerated, thus leading to reduced blood loss.”
HAPPI “showed signs of working almost instantaneously” to stem blood loss upon being injected in mice, according to Mitragotri.
Still, Gao noted that the hemostat has to be tested for both “potential toxicity and therapeutic effect” in larger animal models prior to becoming widely-available for use by first responders.
While researchers have yet to explore translating the hemostat to human patients through commercialization, Mitragotri said he views the latest published findings as “exciting.”
“Stopping internal bleeding is a challenging task,” Mitragotri said. “It needs an agent that is strong enough to induce clots at the bleeding site, but not too strong to induce clots at unwanted sites. So the outcomes of the first studies confirming efficacy in mice was a significant milestone in the project.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched a nationwide search Thursday for its next chief of police, led by a special committee of members spanning the University’s schools.
Current Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis “Bud” D. Riley announced in June that he would retire by the end of the academic year after holding the post for almost 25 years. Prior to joining Harvard, Riley was lieutenant colonel in the Massachusetts State Police.
The person who the search committee taps to succeed Riley will be tasked with leading a university police department that has weathered criticisms for its treatment of minority officers and its policing behind the backdrop of a national movement against police brutality. Those criticisms have prompted some affiliates to call for its abolition.
The 16 members who comprise the search committee will hold listening sessions in the ensuing weeks and months, according to University spokesperson Nate Herpich. Herpich wrote in an email that those sessions will focus on the perspectives of all members of the University, including students, faculty, staff, and current HUPD officers.
Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, who sits on the search committee, said in the emailed press statement he feels a “responsibility” to create an environment at Harvard where his athletes feel safe.
“As an educator first, I feel an obligation and a responsibility to create a safe, supportive, and inclusive environment where our players can learn and lead,” he said. “I want that same culture of inclusion for all of Harvard, and I want to ensure that the concerns and voices of all in our community, in particular our Black and minority students, are represented in important community decisions.”
Vice President for Campus Services Meredith L. Weenick, who co-chaired the University task force on Inclusion and Belonging initiated by former University President Drew G. Faust, said in the statement that she believes the next police chief needs to support a diverse array of affiliates.
“We have an opportunity to take a fresh approach to choosing HUPD’s next chief and to listen to the Harvard community along the way,” Weenick said. “The next chief will be charged with more than preventing crime; more importantly, this individual must support our students in their quest to push the boundaries of inquiry and in their efforts to effect lasting change to our world’s existing systems and structures.”
“This person will need to understand the diversity of points of view on our campuses and the unique cultures present in our 12 Schools, while championing the virtues of free speech,” she added.
Harvard Kennedy School professor Herman B. “Dutch” Leonard, who is also a part of the nationwide search, said in the statement he wants to see the next chief of police “strongly committed to community policing.”
“This means having a deep and positive relationship between all members of the community and the police department that is helping to provide safety and security for them,” Leonard said. “And having a relationship like that requires the police force — and, especially, the chief — to understand both the ordinary and the unique features of our community.”
Leonard also said Harvard should interrogate HUPD’s role within the broader institution of policing.
“In today’s climate of rethinking the balance of responsibilities between police and other agencies — mental health services providers, for example — Harvard may need to do some of its own reexamination of roles and responsibilities, so our next chief also needs to be able to help us reimagine, recalibrate, and redesign what a police force on a modern university campus should be,” he said.
Other members of the selection committee include History of Science professor and former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Undergraduate Council President James A. Mathew ’21, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston, Harvard Law School professor Andrew M. Crespo, and Law School Dean for Administration Matt Gruber.
During his tenure, Riley said he moved HUPD toward a “community policing” model.
Still, the chief the committee selects will have to confront conflicts within the department and between HUPD and the broader University that surfaced during the tail of Riley’s tenure.
An investigation published by The Crimson in January found repeated instances of racism and sexism within HUPD’s walls spanning nearly three decades. In lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews, more than 20 current and former HUPD employees accused Riley of creating a toxic workplace environment and showing favoritism to officers while retaliating against others who spoke out against the culture.
In February, a HUPD officer’s arrest of a black man at the Smith Campus Center drew scrutiny and accusations of excessive force by witnesses. A subsequent inquiry by The Crimson found that the same officer, Anthony T. Carvello, used force while arresting two other black men at the Center within a span of six months, both of whom accused Carvello of using unnecessary force.
In June, as protestors took to the streets of Boston to rally against the murder of George Floyd, the presence of HUPD officers assisting Boston Police at those gatherings provoked backlash on social media and renewed calls to abolish the department. Riley announced his retirement five days later.
Those incidents and criticisms led the University to set in motion an independent review of its police, which is currently underway.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will divide its sexual misconduct policies in two in response to the U.S. Department of Education’s new Title IX regulations — one interim policy to hew to the new federal guidelines, the other to address behavior they no longer span.
Given the limited timeframe within which Harvard had to develop a new policy — in addition to constraints presented by the coronavirus pandemic — the new policies represent “interim” measures Harvard intends to evaluate and modify over the next 12 months. Still, they represent the most significant change to campus sexual misconduct rules in years.
In an emailed statement announcing the shift Friday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote that the school is "committed to fostering a safe environment” where affiliates can achieve “their best work.”
“Despite changes we have been compelled to make by the DOE, the University will go beyond the minimum requirements stipulated by the new regulations and continue to address the same level of conduct that was addressed under our prior policy,” he wrote.
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos passed her new, controversial Title IX rule in early May. At the time, the Department of Education informed universities that they had until August 14 to update their policies to comply with federal law.
Harvard’s response includes both an “Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy” and an “Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy.”
The first is designed to comply with DeVos's changes. Under the new interim policy, Harvard will implement a grievance process — including a live hearing and witness cross-examination — through which formal Title IX complaints will be investigated.
In previous years, Harvard has used a single-investigator model to investigate Title IX complaints. Now, the Office for Dispute Resolution’s initial investigation will proceed to a “hearing panel,” which will issue a report in each case after consulting with the disciplinary board of the relevant school. The hearing panel will be “composed of trained experts within the Harvard community and trained experts outside of the Harvard community.” Of each panel’s three members, two will come from a list of faculty and administrators, and the other from a list of external attorneys.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, Harvard Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said her office based the structure of the hearing on community feedback it has received since DeVos announced the proposed guidelines.
“What we heard from people is that it would be beneficial to have some internal individuals who are familiar with the culture and structures at Harvard, along with some external to Harvard,” she said. “Based on this input, Harvard will adopt a hybrid panel of two individuals from a list of trained administrators and faculty, and one person from a list of external attorneys.”
The panel will issue findings to the respondent’s school, which will determine sanctions accordingly if the group found violations of Harvard’s policy.
In addition to the grievance procedure requirement, DeVos’s new policy also restricts what kinds of sexual misconduct university Title IX departments may investigate. For instance, the new regulations classify complaints about sexual misconduct that took place in an off-campus setting without significant university control, such as a study abroad program, as “Title IX invalid” and prohibits university Title IX departments from investigating them.
Moreover, the regulations also define sexual harassment as conduct that is both “severe” and “pervasive,” rather than severe or pervasive.
In response to Harvard affiliates’ concerns that the federal policy neglects to fully protect students from all forms and in all circumstances of sexual harassment or assault, the University introduced a second Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy to “address misconduct that falls outside the jurisdiction of the Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy.”
Under the Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy, if a formal complaint does not qualify for investigation under Title IX proceedings, the Office of Dispute Resolution will conduct an internal investigation. It will issue its findings directly to the relevant school, which can determine sanctions accordingly. This second process will enable the University to investigate off-campus sexual misconduct through its own channels, Merhill told the Gazette.
“Harvard remains committed to going beyond the minimum requirements stipulated by the new Title IX regulations and to addressing the same types of conduct we addressed prior to the DOE’s changes,” Merhill said.
Despite the major changes, federal authorities also gave universities some leeway.
Harvard said, for example, that it will continue to use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in all its investigations of sexual misconduct, despite the Department of Education offering schools the option to adopt a “clear and convincing” standard which would raise the burden of proof.
Moreover, though the new federal Title IX regulations do not designate a wide range of university personnel as mandated reporters, the University’s interim policy will maintain Harvard’s pre-existing “responsible employee model,” which requires all staff and faculty members to report any instances of sexual misconduct of which they become aware.

Shopping week — five days of excitement for new classes, vigor from a restful summer break, and nervousness from the overwhelming course catalog. This is the first time that shopping week will be held online before the start of the semester, so here are a few tips from Flyby to make the most out of it. Extra points if you proudly wear your pajamas and eat breakfast in front of the entire class!
Set up your shopping week schedule on Harvard’s Coursicle website.
During a typical semester, shopping for more than six or seven classes may have been challenging and stressful to get from place to place (not to mention entering several lotteries, finalizing your four choices, starting your psets, etc). However, now you can dip in and out of different Zoom links without ever getting up from your chair (or your bed). Oh, the joy of not sitting on the floor at the back of an overcrowded lecture hall!
Coursicle is incredibly convenient to use. All you have to do is enter the classes you’re interested in and your schedule is automatically created. Take advantage of the opportunity to be able to move from one class to another without having a hundred students, six TFs, and a vaguely disgruntled professor looking back at you as you walk into lecture 20 minutes late. Add 10, 12, 14 classes to your list! Coursicle is your oyster.
Check which requirements you need to fulfill on my.harvard.
If you’re an incoming freshman, you don’t need to worry too much about fulfilling GenEds with the many semesters ahead of you, but if you’re an upperclassman, you may be interested in crossing one or two off of your list. Although requirements may be getting stricter each year, there’s no denying that many GenEd classes offered are still fascinating and world-class. Looking for an Ethics and Civics class? Consider shopping “GENED 1150: Medicine and Conflict: The History and Ethics of Healing in Political Turmoil.” Need to fulfill your foreign language requirement? Brush up on the one you learned in high school or start a completely new one. American Sign Language has been gaining popularity, so give it a shot!
Email your concentration advisor asking what classes they recommend.
Not only have professors been working hard to make classes more adaptable, but a few concentration departments have also created brand new courses that are meant to be taught virtually. For instance, before your arachnophobia stops you from taking the new OEB 112: Arthropod Biology: “Arachnids and Myriapods, Their Biology and Evolution,” think of it this way — this is actually the best semester to take a class like this because you won’t ever have to see one of their gangly creatures in person. At the very least, reach out to your advisor and hear the advice they have to offer. Chances are, they’re nowhere near as scary as a spider.
Talk to your friends about the classes they’re shopping.
Don’t enroll in a class just because your roommates want you to (we’ve learned the hard way), but listen to what interesting classes they’ve taken note of from Harvard’s enormous course catalog. Maybe you’re a STEM concentrator and haven’t considered a humanities course yet, but now that your friend mentioned adding English 90RJ: “Race and Jurisprudence” to their schedule, you’re willing to check it out too. While you’re putting together a list of courses to shop, ask around for recommendations on what classes people have enjoyed in the past as well.
Take a deep breath! 
This year’s shopping week is completely new for every student and every teaching team. It can be overwhelming, but remember that we’re all in the same boat and plus, you have a few weeks before finalizing your schedule. Lend a helping hand to a professor figuring out breakout rooms and participate when you can to make a class conducive to discussion. We're all still figuring it out!
Though an online shopping week may not be what you had hoped for, there are many advantages of exploring new classes from the comfort of your room. Shop ’til you drop has taken on a whole new meaning.
