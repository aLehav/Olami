After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The morning after housing day of my freshman year, I awoke to a sharp pain slicing down my abdomen.  Moments later, when I looked into the porcelain bowl in my Hollis bathroom, I found the water stained crimson.  School spirit aside, this seemed to be a problem.
A month later, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease called Ulcerative Colitis; six months later, I withdrew from Harvard.
My world-class team of doctors put me on countless different drugs–from steroids, to chemotherapies, to cutting edge ‘biologics.’
I spent months on narcotics like Vicodin to manage pain.  Doctors inserted a 20-gauge needle into my spinal column three times in as many days, twice to inject my own blood and stymie my leaking spinal fluid.  A tube ran down my esophagus, pumping my stomach to prevent the nausea that plagued me.  Nothing worked; my body continued to destroy itself.  Once a healthy 155 pounds, I disintegrated to 112 pounds.
Then, one morning, a surgical team solemnly informed me that my entire large intestine would need to be removed.
In some ways, I was lucky.  Advances in medicine would mean that, after three surgeries, I would lead a mostly normal life.  Admittedly, those were tough months, but between my loving parents, my extraordinary girlfriend, and a handful of close friends, I was never alone.
But why should my story be any different from the countless others who have suffered worse sorrows and surely endured more gracefully?  People’s pains and trials roar with such volume it can make the most caring among us deaf to empathy.
Personal pain becomes a social injustice in the presence of unconscionable ethics.  I discovered there was likely a connection between my disease and a drug I had taken in high school.
Allegedly, I should say.  I’ll never get my day in court to prove it.
When I contacted an attorney, he claimed that a definite connection exists between the drug and the disease, and that the company knew about this connection for years without ever issuing a warning.  Juries have agreed.
He believed I had a claim…unless I had taken a generic form of the drug.  I checked my pharmaceutical records and found only the generic brand listed.  I had no case.  I was stunned.  Why should it matter what brand I had taken?  The drugs were exactly the same.
Last June, the Supreme Court ruled in Pliva v. Mensing, that generic drug manufacturers were not accountable for warning labels on their products.  They believed it unfairly set generic manufacturers in a catch-22 of federal and state laws.  It was a 5-4 decision.
In the minority, Justice Sonia M. Sotomayor asked, “Do you think Congress really intended to create a market in which consumers can only sue brand-named products?  Because if that’s the case, why would anybody ever take a generic medicine?”
The point is more startling than it seems.  Seventy percent of drugs taken in the United States are generics because most insurance plans will cover only generics, if they are available.  Americans don’t have any choice in the matter.  That’s what happened to me.
Justice Thomas, in the majority, denies the court’s culpability, writing, “We acknowledge the unfortunate hand that federal drug regulation has dealt [consumers]…But it is not this Court’s task to decide whether the statutory scheme established by Congress is unusual or even bizarre.”
In the midst of this finger pointing, Thomas fails to acknowledge that the court has bastardized the Supremacy Clause to allow for a legal blind spot.  These justices have created an ‘international waters’, placing the welfare of millions of Americans in unarmed life rafts.
Doubtlessly, this experience has changed me.  Medicine saved my life, but it can’t reverse the damage that was done.  Some soldiers never come back from war, and some that do come back changed.  I don’t claim the bravery that soldiers exhibit on the battlefield, but I will claim a single similarity: The scars on our bodies cover the deeper wounds inside.  Even amidst the strength I am determined to find in this experience, there is something else.  It’s a lingering, of sorts.  A sense of never going back.
Would a seven-figure settlement fix everything?  No.  This is not about money, but responsibility.
So, what to do?  A federal law that established a minimum standard of responsibility for generic drug companies would solve much of the problem.  It may not be feasible to demand generics have the same safety trials as their brand name counterparts, but mandating that safety concerns be reported to the FDA could be a reasonable compromise.  There is no reason why Congress should let a story like mine be told again.
It is an inverted justice that protects businesses over citizens.  I have come to believe that empathy is a faculty of humanity that must be learned through suffering.  That is the only reason I can comprehend for the indifference to wrongs exhibited here.  Whatever normative calculus it was that governed these choices–surely, someone just forgot to carry the one.  Surely, they just didn’t understand.
Surely.  I have to believe that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, the Undergraduate Council and Responsible Investment at Harvard co-hosted a town hall to discuss Harvard’s endowment. The event included a panel with representatives from the Harvard Management Corporation, professors, and Robert Zevin, a vocal critic of Harvard’s investment practices. Yet it was the noted absence of Joshua Humphreys, a senior fellow at the Tellus Institute, which caused considerable controversy. According to Humphreys, he was uninvited from the panel on the day of the event by UC president Danny P. Bicknell ’13, on the grounds that the HMC threatened to not participate unless there were changes to the panel. The University claims that the HMC had been given an inaccurate list of participants prior to the event, and wanted to either reschedule or participate with only the members they had been notified of beforehand.
In the wake of the controversy, Responsible Investment at Harvard released a statement condemning “HMC’s decision to stifle free speech” by allegedly strong-arming the UC into uninviting Humphreys. Similarly, Humphreys labeled the fiasco a “violation…of free speech.” It is unclear to what extent the HMC pressured the UC into removing Humphreys specifically, but one thing is certain: Bicknell and the rest of the Undergraduate Council acted unprofessionally and incompetently in their handling of town hall.
As sponsor, co-host, and gatekeeper of the event, the UC bears full responsibility for any alleged censorship that may or may not have taken place. The Council’s decision to uninvite Humphreys was just one of several options before them, many of which would have avoided accusations of censorship against Harvard University. Unfortunately, such a debacle as this not only taints the conversation surrounding responsible investment at Harvard, but also needlessly worsens the University’s reputation as a fair-weather protector of free speech.
What’s more, the UC’s apparent abdication of responsibility in their communications with Humphreys—choosing to lay blame on HMC rather than accepting it themselves—led Responsible Investment at Harvard to issue an inaccurate statement, discrediting a group for no reason.
While some may be inclined to see HMC’s request to reschedule or change the panel as an attempt on the part of the University to forgo criticism, the evidence suggests otherwise. It is extremely unlikely that the University would have threatened to withdraw at the last minute had they had adequate warning about the makeup of the panel. The fact of the matter is that the UC provided HMC with an inaccurate list of panelists prior to the event. It is only fair that all participants in a forum know ahead of time who else is taking part, so that they can prepare for a fruitful discussion. Given that last minute changes were made to the panel, the HMC had every right to express concern. The UC failed to be diligent in keeping its invitees abreast of the panel’s changing makeup, and, as a result, wound up greatly disrespecting Humphreys.
It is imperative that the groups organizing a panel of a contentious nature should take full responsibility for decisions regarding invitation and, yes, uninvitation rather than allowing their own errors to damage the reputations of the organizations that agreed to speak on their panel in the first place. In the case of the endowment town hall, the UC placed undue blame on HMC, thereby inviting a host of inaccurate accusations regarding the University’s desire to stifle free speech. The sooner the UC takes full responsibility, the better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1982, Hafez Assad, the father of Syria’s current president, encircled a few rebelling neighborhoods of Hama, a city in central Syria, and then promptly leveled them. Tens of thousands died along with their revolution. The world responded to this premeditated massacre as it responds today to events in Sudan—there was no response. Thirty years later, Hafez Assad’s son repeats his father’s massacres with different methods. The international profile of the events may have increased, but the results in 2012 are similar to those in 1982. In fact, this last year in Syria demonstrates that although the international world’s bark is louder, its bite is still weak.
Let’s review last week’s events. After groveling in Moscow and Beijing, Kofi Annan pitched his peace plan in Tehran on Wednesday, citing “special relations” between Tehran and Damascus. Any illusions of the trip’s success were shattered by the Iranian Foreign Minister’s insistence that change in Syria occur under the helm of Bashar Assad. Which is, more or less, the exact opposite of the desires of the revolutionaries.
Two days ago, on Apr. 11, the Syrian military and the Free Syrian Army promised to stop fighting per Annan’s peace plan. As of that evening, the ceasefire was “only partially observed,” according to the Syrian National Council, while Syrian state media already reported one “terrorist” attack. Like last week’s ceasefire, this one, too, will be more of an opportunity to reload than an actual stop to the fighting. After all, a ceasefire only works when both sides want to cease firing.
Unfortunately, Annan’s peace plan is not the only one based in good intentions instead of good results. The past year illustrates that the international community has a full arsenal of what can only be described as “passive actions.”
Speaking to the Washington Post two weeks ago, a senior Obama Administration official explained America’s strategy in Syria: “What we’re doing is increasing diplomatic pressure, working on humanitarian access, and pushing the transition forward.” If that language sounds familiar, it is because officials have been reciting that diplomatic mumbo-jumbo for almost a year now. In terms of influencing events in foreign relations, tone is as relevant as the words used themselves. And the tone of American officials hardly incites fear in the Syrian regime.
However, don’t worry about American inaction because the European Union recently extended its sanctions to Asma Assad, the President’s wife. Presumably, there were concerns that her fondue sets and boutique candles were being transformed into torture devices. By the way, after more than a year, and thirteen official rounds of sanctions against the Syrian regime, the European Union has successfully enacted sanctions on exactly four members of the Assad family and eight government ministers. Double digits! Wunderbar!
Economic sanctions are perhaps the most commonly used passive action. First, as I have written before, politicians and pundits dangerously discuss economic sanctions as if all they are all equal. Furthermore, economic sanctions are meant to be a tool of soft power, but soft power is only effective when there is an implied threat of hard power. Without quality control and hard power backing them up, economic sanctions are more liable to destroy people than governments.
Nor is it simply governments that can be accused of systemic passivity, but also international organizations. Paradoxically, the United Nations’ concern for daily abuses of human rights, alongside Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the whole humanitarian behemoth, can in certain instances prevent the long-term realization of human rights. The precise, day-by-day reports on dead and wounded make lowering those numbers the central priority of the international community instead of the realization of revolution itself. It may not be a comforting idea, but revolutions sometimes require violence. And perhaps we have become too inflexible in our opposition to violence.
While the West counts dead bodies, other forces ensure their continued existence. High-ranking defectors from the Syrian military say Iran “has dispatched hundreds of advisers, security officials and intelligence operatives to Syria, along with weapons, money, and electronic surveillance equipment.” The revolution was sectarian from its inception. Any suggestions to the contrary are woefully misguided. The West’s passive role was supposed to have limited the possibility of sectarian violence. But only more active steps can prevent its escalation.
One Syrian activist, Radwen Ziadeh, summed up last week’s events with the title of his editorial in The New Republic, “Why Did Anyone Believe Bashar Al-Assad’s Promises of Ceasefire to Begin With?” Ziadeh never provides an answer to his own question. He can’t. As spokesperson for the Syria National Council, he won’t say what we all know: Current international gullibility is mainly a consequence of international exasperation with a council that is hardly Syrian, barely national, and rarely a council. There are many practical concerns with taking an active step: the Syrian National Council’s discord, the Free Syrian Army’s disorganization, sectarian violence, and so on.
In Syria, there are no good options. However, the worst option is more passivity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are times when we must be suspect of calls for civility. Particularly at an institution like Harvard, where we are sometimes told that even war criminals must be given a place at the table, we must learn to see through the pleas for humanity when they are used quite shamelessly to cover up inhumanity, and to discern with clarity when the word civility becomes a ploy to distract us from the incivility we are not meant to notice.
In a recent Crimson article, organizers of the upcoming Harvard Israel Conference pleaded with the campus community to engage in “civil discourse,” offering their conference—a celebration of Israel’s economic achievements—as an example of the kind of discourse that would bring “new meaning” to campus dialogue. They mentioned that their posters had been defaced—an incident which I, of course, condemn—with the words “apartheid” and “white phosphorus.” However, they neglected to mention the third sticker that had been placed atop their posters: the portrait of political prisoner Hana Shalabi. Putting aside other allegations, it is worthwhile for us to remember who Hana Shalabi is and why the authors refused to print her name.
Hana Shalabi is a 29-year-old woman from Jenin, a town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In 2009, Israeli soldiers raided her house and threw her in jail, holding her in “administrative detention” for 25 months without charge on the claim that she may be a supporter of the terrorist organization Islamic Jihad. After more than two years in prison with no charges ever levied, Israel released her as part of a prisoner swap. Four months later, the IDF raided her house in the dead of night and arrested her yet again.
When no charges were levied against her for the second time, she launched a 43-day hunger strike, and it was only two weeks ago that Israel struck a deal to essentially deport her instead of letting her die, meaning that Shalabi will likely never see her family again.
Why did the conference organizers not mention Shalabi? Israel and its proponents have a great deal of power, a fact which allows them to speak at length about the country’s flourishing economy while ignoring military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and the experiences of human beings like Shalabi. It is quite astounding that some conference organizers—including a proud former soldier of the army occupying the West Bank—feel a moral right to lecture the Harvard community about civility when they are essentially putting together a propaganda show celebrating the innovation of one of the world’s most egregious violators of human rights (if United Nations Security Council resolutions are anything to go by).
The Israel Conference, however, fits the mold of Israel’s recent public relations schemes. After the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in 2008-2009 that left nearly 1,400 Palestinians dead, Israel realized it could no longer defend its actions in front of the world and subsequently focused on promoting a sanitized, liberal version of “Brand Israel” instead.
A major tactic it has since pursued is “greenwashing,” which refers to a strategy by which an image of environmental consciousness is promoted by the Israeli government in order to make the country more likable to liberals and progressives who would otherwise condemn the country’s systematic human rights abuses.
This strategy is not only repulsive because it co-opts environmentalism in order to maintain support for a brutal military occupation, but also because Israel specifically undermines environmentally friendly measures when pursued by Palestinians. Israel diverts 80 percent of the occupied West Bank’s water aquifers to cities in Israel proper, starving Palestinian farms in order to nourish the trees they boast about. Israel also limits the ability of Palestinians to access their own water, systematically stalling or denying permits for water projects.
Meanwhile, where Jewish settlements in the West Bank are readily linked to Israeli water and electricity grids, Palestinian towns are not and are often refused permits to develop their own infrastructure. Israel has also been accused of systematically targeting and demolishing water and electricity infrastructure, including a series of German-funded solar panels currently slated for demolition for lacking the same permits that Israel systematically refuses to give out. The result? Palestinians often have to turn to the Israeli national water company for service, compelling them to pay the same government that occupies them in order to access the water underneath their own feet.
The Israel Conference, of course, will not mention how Israel undermines the right of Palestinians to development and innovation. It will not mention Hana Shalabi or the Palestinian villagers compelled to pay taxes to fund the occupation (and innovation!) of the state that has dispossessed them. Contrary to the conference organizers’ claims, the Harvard Israel Conference will not provide a “new paradigm,” nor does it present “new ways to engage.” Indeed, it offers us merely more of the same—civility in the service of a brutal, unending occupation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In March 2011, the Harvard and Princeton men’s basketball teams squared off in a one-game playoff to decide the Ivy League’s representative in the NCAA tournament. The Tigers prevailed in a thrilling finish, swishing a basket at the buzzer to defeat the Crimson, 63-62.
That excitement could soon be an annual possibility, as the Ivy League is exploring the prospect of organizing an annual postseason tournament for the conference’s automatic NCAA tournament bid. The Ivy League is currently the only automatic-bid conference without a tournament, instead sending its regular season champion to the 68-team tournament.
According to Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris, Ivy coaches are preparing a proposal for a four-team, two-round tournament that would include the top four finishers in the regular season standings.
Harris said the coaches’ pitch also includes the removal of one game from the schedule in order to avoid any additional missed class time for players. The Ivy League consciously avoids this problem by playing regular season basketball games almost exclusively on Friday and Saturday nights.
In order to be approved, the proposal must wind its way through the Ivy League bureaucracy in a series of steps. First, the coaches must send the proposal to the conference’s eight athletic directors for a vote. If the athletic directors reach a consensus to approve the motion, it then proceeds to a policy committee, consisting of university vice presidents from each school. Following an endorsement by the policy committee, the eight university presidents render a final decision, according to Yale men’s basketball coach James Jones.
The proposal is patterned after the Ivy League lacrosse tournament, instituted in 2010, which also features four teams. University and conference administrators took two years to implement the lacrosse tournament after its initial proposal.
The Ivy basketball coaches have explored the possibility of staging a conference tournament in the past, but Jones said that the idea has never gotten beyond the athletic directors’ vote.
“I think that some ADs are worried about the added expense [of a tournament],” Jones said. “But we’ve seen what happened with the one-game playoff in 2002 [between Yale and Penn] and last year [between Harvard and Princeton] that there’s some positive things to come out of it financially.”
The 2011 playoff between Harvard and Princeton attracted enough fans to sell out Yale’s 3,100-seat Payne Whitney Gymnasium, and many more watched the Tigers’ victory on ESPN3’s national broadcast. But Harris stressed that finances would not be the primary concern in coming to a decision.
“We haven’t really speculated as to whether it would be profitable or not,” Harris said. “We certainly hope it could be, but that’s not how we make our determinations.”
By staging a conference tournament, smaller leagues can earn what might be their only national television exposure of the year. In 2012, ESPN aired 137 games in 11 days as part of its “Championship Week” coverage, including 23 Division I conference title games.
But skeptics argue that awarding the league’s automatic bid to the winner of a conference tournament reduces the league’s chances of sending its best team to the NCAA tournament, as the potential for an upset increases in a single-elimination format. In March, Sun Belt regular-season champion Middle Tennessee State fell to Arkansas State in the Sun Belt tournament quarterfinals, paving the way for Western Kentucky to receive the league’s NCAA tournament bid, despite finishing with a losing record. Middle Tennessee State, which finished 27-7 and seven games above Western Kentucky in the regular season standings, was left out of the NCAA tournament.
“There’s a compelling argument that the Ivy League does it right as of now,” Harvard Assistant Director of Athletics Kurt Svoboda said. “You get the best team over the course of a season, as opposed to one team getting hot over the course of a weekend.”
The Crimson, the two-time defending Ivy League champion and the consensus favorite in 2012-13, could lose the most from the potential for upsets in a conference tournament. But Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker still supports the initiative as positive for the conference as a whole.
“I have been in favor of ways for us to increase our brand of Ivy League basketball for the future,” Amaker said. “I’m not trying to look at it from where we are today, I’m trying to look at it from where we are as a league. And if that’s what we decide on as a league I will be in favor of it, I’ve been like that from day one.”
As Ivy basketball becomes more competitive nationwide, exemplified by the Crimson’s spending nine weeks ranked in the ESPN/USA Today Top 25, the prospect of two Ivy teams receiving bids to the NCAA tournament is becoming more realistic. By NCAA regulations, the Ivy League regular season champion would also secure an automatic bid to the NIT if it lost in the conference tournament.
“I think [that a tournament] would benefit our league in a variety of ways—the excitement and the energy we see that goes on in other conferences around the country,” Amaker said.  “I think more than anything else if you polled or asked our players, not just our current players but former Ivy-League basketball players, I can’t imagine that many of them wouldn’t be in favor of the opportunity to play in their postseason conference tournament.”
Despite the support of Ivy players and coaches, there is still a long road ahead before changes could be officially enacted. The proposal would still need to overcome a variety of hurdles, including the approval of Ivy administrators.
“When you look into something like this, lots of factors come up,” Amaker said. “Where would you do it? Would there be one site? Do you do it at the higher seed’s site? Do you do it at a neutral site? There are many things to figure out if this becomes something that gains any kind of momentum.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 15
An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the proposed plan for an Ivy League men’s basketball tournament includes removing one conference game in the regular season. In fact, the proposed plan includes removing one regular season game from the overall schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Next week, students will have the opportunity to participate in two focus groups that will inform the work of the Task Force on Student Voice, a newly created committee which aims to enhance communication between students, faculty, and staff at Harvard.
In an email sent to the student body Wednesday, Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson invited students to share their “thoughts about the philosophy and values that should guide student involvement” by participating in one of the focus groups.
The creation of the Task Force is the second phase of a two-part plan to increase student engagement on campus, and the focus groups represent an effort to include the voices of the entire student body.
In January, a Leadership Intensive Program allowed Undergraduate Council representatives to speak directly with administrators. Both initiatives have been spearheaded by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in conjunction with the Office of Student Life and the UC.
On Monday and Tuesday of next week, the Task Force will offer two focus groups as an opportunity for the student body to contribute to the discussion. The Office of Student Life has also created an online comment box for those who cannot attend.
While there are no guarantees that the administration will adopt any of the recommendations generated by the focus groups or the Task Force, Hammonds said in an emailed statement that the College values student opinion on the issue.
“We are hopeful that there will be recommendations we can act on,” she wrote.
The Task Force on Student Voice, created earlier this semester, is comprised of eight students—five UC representatives, a House Committee chair, and two student organization leaders.
There has also been some faculty involvement in the Task Force. Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter currently serves as the co-chair, and several deans and professors are a part of the Task Force as well.
Three months into their term, UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 and Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13 have made it a priority to introduce initiatives that aim to bridge the student-administration gap, a key point of their campaign platform last semester.
“Currently, we are looking to improve student feedback channels,” Bicknell said.
In addition to the Task Force on Student Voice, the UC also created the “Lunch with a Dean” program and worked with administrators at the Office of Student Life to establish regular office hours.
Hammonds said that while these initiatives represent a step in the right direction, she understands that this is an issue that will require sustained effort.
“One issue that needs to be tackled is ensuring that when students participate in decision-making committees, the information they learn there is shared with the broader community of students, and that they are, in turn, accurately reflecting student views to administrators and faculty,” she said.

Ten finalist teams have been selected from more than 170 applicants to the President’s Challenge for social entrepreneurship, the University announced Thursday. Each finalist team will receive $5,000 as well as research space in Harvard’s I-Lab through August 2012.
“It is gratifying to see how fully these finalists have embraced the spirit of collaboration, of innovation, and of curiosity that is the hallmark of the i-lab,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “I am impressed with both their engagement with new ideas and their novel ways of enabling those ideas to reach the wider world.”
The Challenge, announced this February, seeks to encourage student social entrepreneurship by rewarding student groups with resources to develop innovative solutions to five pre-selected global problems: clean air, global health, education, clean water, and personal health.
The chosen projects range from creating a ceramic water filter plant in Uganda to launching a car-sharing business in India similar to Zipcar.
“The proposals are ambitious and have the potential to make a real difference in the world. It’s gratifying to see how the students develop their ideas at the i-lab,” said University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 in a statement.
Zachary D. Wissner-Gross, team leader for “Team School Yourself” and a fifth-year Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School, plans to publish textbooks online with interactive tools. He described being selected as a finalist as a “temporary moment to celebrate” after working on the project for the past few months.
Though Wissner-Gross said he was grateful to receive monetary support, he noted that he was also aware of the more symbolic significance.
“I think that there’s no reason that entrepreneurship and invention can’t be a major part of not only the college experience or even the high school or middle school experience,” he said.
David N. Back, a third-year law school student who leads the car-sharing team, said that the benefit of winning the President’s Challenge extend beyond the monetary prize.
“The monetary prize, though it [is] nice, is definitely not sufficient,” he said. “There’s a lot of benefits that come beyond that. Harvard has intellectual resources. It has connections far beyond [the Challenge] that make the project much more likely to succeed.”

General Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called the current state of global security one defined by a paradox—with both increasing levels of geopolitical stability and a diffusion of access to powerful weapons—in an address at the Institute of Politics Thursday night.
“I believe I am chairman at a time that seems less dangerous, but is actually more dangerous,” Dempsey said. “Although geopolitical trends are ushering in greater levels of peace and stability worldwide, destructive technologies are available to a wider and more disparate group of adversaries.”
Dempsey’s words were timely—at around 6:45 p.m., two members of Dempsey’s staff left the JFK Forum. According to an IOP volunteer who wished to remain anonymous, the staff members were responding to the news that North Korea had just launched a long-range rocket in defiance of repeated international protests. The rocket broke apart shortly after blastoff. According to the BBC, North Korean officials have stated that the rocket launch was intended to place a weather observation satellite in orbit, but the United States and allied nations suspect that the launch was a cover for a long-range missile test, which would be a necessary technology for a developing nuclear weapons program.
In his presentation, Dempsey addressed many of the concerns over global security that are exemplified by events such as the recent North Korean rocket launch.
“More people have the ability to harm us or to deny us the ability to act than at any time in my life,” Dempsey said.
But he insisted that he did not want to instill a sense of “doom and gloom” in his audience.
“There is one idea I should purge from your mind tonight—and that is that we are a nation in decline,” Dempsey said.
“Look, we’ve still got a lot of tricks up or sleeves,” he continued. “But the message is that the margin of error is growing smaller and smaller.”
During the talk, Dempsey outlined his plan for the future of the United States military.
“The force we are building really is a force that can win any conflict, repel any threat, and protect our interests,” he said. “With the pace of the development of the threats I described, I believe this force needs to be in place by 2020.”
Despite the grave nature of his discussion, Dempsey remained optimistic. Alluding to his time as an English professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he quoted the opening lines of Charles Dickens’ “A Tale of Two Cities”: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.”
Echoing Dickens’ sentiment, General Dempsey continued, “So this is the security paradox that we face today: As counterintuitive combination of peace and the potential for violence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard community members who have made significant contributions to sustainability efforts on campus and beyond were honored at the third annual Green Carpet Awards in Sanders Theater Thursday afternoon.
University President Drew G. Faust said that she was glad that “sustainability is a goal that continues to unify us as one Harvard,” in a welcome video.
In addition to students, faculty, and staff who were honored as “Optimizers,” “Innovators,” “Educators,” and “Influencers,” the event honored Lester R. Brown, a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School.
Brown, who is the founder of the Worldwatch Institute and the founder and director of the Earth Policy Institute, received the Office for Sustainability’s first ever Distinguished Service Award.
“Carbon emissions in the United States are dropping,” he said. “They started to decline because of the economic downturn, but they have continued [to drop] for other reasons. And this, I think, is one of the most exciting developments anywhere.”
Brown attributed the continued drop in emissions partially to a demographic shift among gasoline consumers.
“People aren’t addicted to cars the way they used to be,” he said, adding that in his generation young people were eager to buy cars because they served as an important social space. Brown said that he believes that young people today buy fewer cars in part because they increasingly socialize online.
The award ceremony was emceed by Peter D. Davis ’12, who has also served as the master of ceremonies at the popular annual Harvard Thinks Big event.
“There are many people out there in this country who believe that those who believe in the environment and sustainability are a special interest group,” said Davis. “But I hope that this event can show that this is the exact opposite of a special interest.”
The ceremony also honored mechanical engineering professor Frederick H. Abernathy, who said that he thinks sustainability should be seen as both economic and environmental. Abernathy noted that he originally became involved in sustainability when the faculty considered tearing down William James Hall due to its energy costs.
At the event, Abernathy sported a bow tie with two shades of green.
“One is for the green carpet, and one is the green for money,” he said.
Robert Gogan, associate manager of recycling and waste, was dubbed Harvard Recycling Czar at the event.
Gogan stressed that Harvard’s recycling is a communal effort, noting that among other initiatives, the University has a project that refurbishes and sells old computers.
“Everyone recycles, everyone drinks water,” he said.

Robust immigration laws have fostered the exploitation of undocumented laborers, Social Studies Lecturer Rebecca B. Galemba argued at a movie screening hosted by Harvard College Act on a Dream on Thursday evening.
The movie screening featured the documentary “Papers,” which chronicles the stories of undocumented young adults who have felt the legal and social effects of immigration laws.
“We really wanted to bring a face to the issue and this is a movie that does that really well,” said HCAD Co-Chair Maria I. Romero ’15. “Hopefully by seeing a family who’s really affected by the issue, we hope to reach a side that isn’t just cold-hard facts.”
Following the screening, Galemba facilitated a discussion about the film and the current immigration issues facing the United States.
“I think it’s really important to see the people involved in this and see the human side of what immigration policy has caused,” Galemba said.
Galemba also teaches a freshman seminar called “Beyond The Great Immigration Debate.”
HCAD was formed to help advocate for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which was first introduced in Congress in 2001. The bill, if passed, would provide a path to permanent residency to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors and graduated from high school.
University President Drew G. Faust has publicly lobbied in support of the bill.
“Our goal in this event has been to bring greater awareness about the DREAM Act to campus because the DREAM Act and immigration in general is something that we feel is under-discussed,” Romero said.
As both an immigrant and member of HCAD, Sylvia A. Percovich ’15 said the event held particular resonance. She said she could relate to the many of the problems facing the characters in the film.
“It’s something that I’ve [seen my] family go through and something I’ve experienced to a certain extent,” Percovich said.
On Wednesday, the group also a hosted a freshman study break in Annenberg. Participants played an immigration-related trivia game while enjoying ice cream.
“It was more about talking about the misconceptions people have about immigrants, like whether they pay taxes or pay social security,” Co-Chair Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco ’15 said.

A group of undergraduate women have organized a campaign for the creation of a course on women in politics.
Last week, students circulated a petition and survey over email listservs to gauge the student body’s interest for such a class. Though the Harvard Kennedy School offered a course on women and leadership this fall, the College did not offer a comparable one this academic year.
Of the nearly 200 students who responded, 70 percent said they would take the course if the College chose to offer it for either General Education or concentration credit, according to Nadia L. Farjood ’13, an inactive Crimson editor who is spearheading the campaign.
Farjood said that though the survey was somewhat informal, she found its results encouraging.
“This is important for diversity and especially in this modern era where more women are finding roads into positions of power,” Farjood said.
Farjood said she initially realized this dearth in the course catalog when searching for classes that would bolster her knowledge of the role of women in government, the topic on which she plans to write her thesis.
“I think that it’s ridiculous that at a University, especially where government is the second largest concentration, there is no class for women in political power,” Farjood said.
After her course catalog search ended in frustration, Farjood approached members of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership at the Institute of Politics and asked them to help organize her push for the creation of the course.
Women’s Initiative in Leadership Chair Victoria E. Wenger ’14, who has joined Farjood’s effort, said the proposed course is highly relevant and politically important.
“Addressing critical questions about why [gender] discrepancies remain needs to be done, particularly in academic setting like this,” Wenger said.
Farjood said the group will submit a report comprised of the survey and petition results, an outline for the proposed curriculum, and an analysis of peer institutions’ course offerings to the College administration for review.
The students have yet to select a faculty member that could teach the proposed course. According to Brandy A. L. Machado ’14, a member of Women’s Initiative in Leadership, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences does not currently employ a professor who specializes in women in politics.
Despite this deterrent, organizers said that the course they have proposed is vitally important and needs to be adopted by the College.
“Women are still very far behind in terms of leadership, and educating people in that is one of first steps to fixing the problem,” Machado said.

Bo Guagua, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, has captured the attention of international media following the political downfall of his father, a former Communist Party leader, and the arrest of his mother for the alleged murder of her son’s mentor.
Bo Guagua’s father, Bo Xilai, was removed from his position as Party secretary of China’s Chongqing municipality in March and then ousted from the Politburo—China’s most influential political body—the following month. The reasons for his rapid downfall are not entirely clear, but include allegations of corruption and overextension of power.
At the root of much of the publicity surrounding the younger Bo is his connections with the late Neil Heywood, a British businessman who lived in China until his death last fall. Bo’s mother Gu Kailai, wife of Bo Xilai, was arrested for Heywood’s murder earlier this month.
Heywood is thought to have served as a mentor to the younger Bo by helping him gain admission to Harrow—a prestigious English secondary school—and Oxford University. Chinese authorities said that the family’s relationship with Heywood soured following “a conflict over economic interests,” according to a report in The Daily Mail.
While he was a student in England, Bo Guagua’s behavior came under scrutiny as reporters examined rumors of his father’s corruption. Many questioned how the family could afford to underwrite the private education and glamorous social life of their son, who was well known for throwing lavish parties and driving a red Ferrari in Beijing.
As the controversy heated up in recent weeks, Bo Guagua has removed himself from the public eye. His last clear public communication followed his father’s removal from his position as party leader last month.
“My personal desire is to focus on my studies and be left out of the political intrigues,” he wrote in an email to The Times of London.
He was believed to be residing in his Cambridge apartment as recently as Tuesday, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Some reports have speculated that he will seek asylum in the United States after he receives his degree from the Kennedy School next month.
Bo Guagua could not be reached for comment.
Kennedy School Professor of Practice Emeritus Marvin Kalb said that the recent stir in the media over the family indicates growing political tensions in China.
“Clearly Bo [Xilai] was someone who challenged the assumptions of the party and the timetable of the party,” Kalb said. “The people in power looked upon him as someone who was who challenging their authority.”
He added, “What you’re looking at is a [potential] change of direction of the Communist Party.... I believe the traditionalists at this point will end up winning the day. The man who represented a fundamental threat to their power and their style has been purged.”

Since 2010, the computer science concentration has experienced the highest growth in undergraduate enrollment out of all departments at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—from 95 to 169 students. Many professors and students in the department have attributed this change to the increasing popularity of the introductory course Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I.”
The enrollment jump in CS50—from 494 in the fall of 2010 to 607 this academic year—has been reflected in a parallel increase in the number of students taking higher-level departmental courses. Enrollment in Computer Science 51: “Introduction to Computer Science II” grew from 167 to 217 students in the last year, according to John G. Morrisett, the course’s professor. Similarly, the size of Computer Science 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization” shot from 70 students in 2009 to 109 last fall, according to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office.
Both professors and students have praised CS50 course head David J. Malan and his staff for drawing new students to the discipline through their interactive and engaging pedagogical style and ability to highlight the relevance and accessibility of a subject matter often portrayed as abstruse and overly-complex.
“Malan has made the course fun, developed a great sense of community, and manages to teach a lot—keeping the material challenging but very, very accessible,” said Morrisett.
According to Malan, CS50 will implement “bigger-than-usual” changes for the fall of 2012. “It will definitely be a good year to take CS50,” he said.
Many students cite CS50 as a motivating factor in their decision to declare Computer Science concentrations.
“I took CS50 the fall of my freshman year and thought it was awesome. After I took it, I realized I wanted to take more CS classes and concentrate in CS,” said Travis A. Downs ’14. “I’ve now taken CS51, CS121, and CS105 as well.”
Despite its success, CS50 itself does not entirely explain the appeal of the Computer Science concentration.
“I had wanted to concentrate in computer science since coming to the college,” Wen-Yuan Yao ’13 said, “I think, regardless of how CS50 went, I probably would have taken more CS classes.”
Others have said that the intensity of the coursework in the computer science department may actually deter students after they take introductory courses.
“If anything, CS50 and the stress was more likely to make me want to stop—just because my project actually went terribly and I didn’t enjoy the last part,” said James P. Hamilton ’14. who is now a linguistics concentrator.
Though CS50 may serve as an entry point into computer science, students and professors emphasize the significant differences between the introductory classes and more advanced coursework, including greater mathematical sophistication and an increased focus on computational thinking.
“CS50 has established a sort of ‘brand’ with phrases like ‘This is CS50,’ so we like to jokingly say ‘This is not CS50’,” Morrisett said.
However, courses such as CS50 have convinced students of the value of computer science courses in other fields of study.
Madelaine D. Boyd ’12, who was a CS61 teaching fellow in the fall, said that she noticed that many of the students in her section were combining computer science with very different degrees.
“Computer science is a highly interdisciplinary major, so it makes sense,” she said. “Any area of study nowadays can benefit from efficient computation on large data sets.”
Morrisett noted the “vast majority” of his students were not planning to become computer science concentrators but were rather drawn from across campus—“everything from art history to biology to economics to mathematics to physics.”
Other initiatives by the department have also been instrumental in the growth of enrollment. The CS faculty has implemented an interactive “project-based” focus in many of its courses and developed new ones covering topics in visualization, privacy, and human-computer interaction. Moreover, the establishment of the computer science secondary field—which requires only four computer science courses—has played an integral role in growth, according to Morrisett.
“I’d say a pretty significant fraction of the students in CS51 will go on to do a minor,” he said.
The growing demand for employees with programming experience has also been cited as an important cause of growth.
“I also think that the rise of Facebook and, more generally, an awareness that you can change the world through just a little bit of knowledge about computation is attracting students,” said Morrisett.
Even Hollywood may have played a role.
“I don’t underestimate the impact of ‘The Social Network’ in planting an idea in somebody’s head, even though that film doesn’t accurately depict life of a CS concentrator,” said CS professor Harry R. Lewis ’68.

UPDATED: FEBRUARY 15, 2012, at  8:03 p.m.
Massachusetts Congressional candidate Joseph P. Kennedy III raised $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2012, his campaign announced Friday. The total is more than six times the amount raised by his chief Republican opponent Sean Bielat and puts Kennedy firmly atop the Fourth Congressional District cash race.
"For any candidate to raise that money in a Congressional campaign...is really extraordinary," Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman said. "You have incumbent Congressman that can't come close to matching those numbers."
The 31-year-old Kennedy announced in January that he would seek the Fourth District seat being vacated by retiring Congressman Barney Frank ‘61-’62. Kennedy immediately became the Democratic frontrunner in the race, and polls have shown him to have as much as a two-to-one lead over Republican frontrunner Bielat.
Bielat’s campaign announced last week that he had raised approximately $175,000 in the first three months of 2012. Both Kennedy and Bielat hold Harvard degrees.
Kennedy’s campaign has focused its efforts on grass-roots fundraising in recent weeks. In anticipation of on the first quarter fundraising deadline, the camp launched “Raise the Roots” fundraising initiative and honored grassroots donors in an effort to drum up widespread, on-the-ground support.
In an email to supporters Friday, the campaign said the first-quarter funds came from roughly 1,500 donors, nearly half of whom gave $100 or less.
“Not only will this money go a long way in ensuring we have the resources we need in the fall, but it is a fantastic show of the kind of on-the-ground support this campaign is built on,” Kennedy campaign manager Nick Clemons wrote in the email.
However, Bielat’s campaign has been critical of Kennedy’s campaigns emphasis on their grassroots base.
“They’re already desperate to play the number game,” said Bielat’s campaign communications director Sarah Rumpf. “We don’t have to carve out the segments of our numbers to show that we’re a grassroots campaign.”
Kennedy’s Republican opponents have also been critical of the support he has drawn because of his family’s name and connections. Kennedy held fundraising events in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles last month. Though the campaign has not released any indication of the amount of money raised outside the district or the Commonwealth, political experts have speculated that much of Kennedy’s financial backing is likely farther afield than the Fourth District.
Bielat, who ran unsuccessfully against Frank two years ago, is thought to have a wide donor network outside of the district as well. But his totals thus far are considerably more modest than Kennedy’s— Bielat’s campaign donations averaged $90 each and have come from roughly 1,900 individuals.
“It will be a challenge to compete dollar-for-dollar with the big money checks that oil the Kennedy/Democratic machine,” Bielat said in statement last week. “But this strong start gives us the resources we need to get our message out to the voters of the Fourth District.”
The race’s other serious Republican contender, Elizabeth Childs, announced last week that she had raised just under $100,000 in total. Childs is the former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health and a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School.
The official first quarter filing date for campaign transactions is not until April 15. Full itemized records will not be made public until shortly thereafter.

To say sophomore basketball player Laurent Rivard has had a busy year is an understatement. Knocking down 20 points for Harvard in its NCAA tournament game against Vanderbilt, coming in seventh in Crimson history with 127 career three-pointers, and being the third leading-scorer on the Crimson this season are just some of this Canadian sharpshooter’s season highlights. After helping his team get to the Big Dance this spring, the computer science concentrator solidified his spot in Harvard sports history.
But this resident of Cabot House is linked to Crimson athletics in more ways than one. Laurent’s girlfriend Christie DiSilvestro is a sophomore water polo player, and his roommate, and high school teammate, Matt Brown is a fellow guard on the basketball team. Continuing the series, for Love or The Game, we asked Laurent some quick questions, and then quizzed Christie and Matt on what they thought were the correct answers. So who actually knows the sharpshooter better, the baller or the shot-caller?
Laurent Rivard, sophomore guard
Favorite athlete: Lance Armstrong
Pre-game jam: Lil' Wayne
Secret talent: Completing the Rubik’s cube in sub-2 minute time

Pre-game jam: Fabulous (0)
Secret talent: Bike riding (0)
Favorite TV show: Dexter (0)
Favorite late-night food: Candy (5)
Superpower of choice: Teleport (0)
Total: 5/60 - This is a tough blow for Brown. But will his knowledge of Rivard’s sweet tooth be even close to enough to beat out DiSilvestro?
Christie DiSilvestro, sophomore water polo player and Laurent’s girlfriend 
Favorite athlete: Lance Armstrong (10)
Pre-game jam: Taylor Swift (0)
Secret talent: Rubik’s cube (10)
TV Show: Dexter (0)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard women’s lacrosse team, this weekend’s matchup with Princeton is of the utmost importance.
“This is probably the biggest game of our season,” junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “It’s definitely going to be huge.”
The fate of the Crimson (6-6, 2-2 Ivy), which hosts the Tigers (6-5, 3-1) at Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, rests very heavily on the result of this game. The Crimson is currently in fifth place in the Ivy League, while Princeton sits at the number three spot. The league’s top four finishers at the end of the regular season receive a bid to the Ivy League tournament, where the winner will receive an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
A Crimson win over the Tigers would put the two teams in a tie for fourth place.
“We know that this is a crucial game for us to win so that we are still in the running to go to the Ivy tournament,” senior attacker Jess Halpern said. “We want to be able to get into the tournament on our own fate—we don’t want to have to wait on the [chance] of other teams losing.”
For Harvard, which entered the 2012 season ranked No. 19 in the country, a chance to play in the Ivy League tournament—and potentially the NCAAs—is something the team has looked forward to all year.
“We dropped some games in the beginning of the season to some top-ranked teams, and that wasn’t ideal,” said VanderMeulen, whose squad’s non-conference losses likely eliminated its shot at an at-large bid. “But [winning] the Ivy League is an automatic bid. So that’s just kind of the goal right now–grab that bid and go to the NCAAs.”
If the Crimson were to get to the NCAA tournament, it would be its first appearance since 1994.
“To be able to get into the NCAAs would be amazing,” Halpern said. “No one on this team has ever had that opportunity, and we know Harvard lacrosse has been there in the past. In the ’80s and ’90s they made it to the NCAAs all the time, so it’s definitely a point that we want to bring the team back to.”
To get this chance Harvard will have to overcome a strong Princeton team which suffered its lone Ivy loss to fourth-place Cornell by one goal two weeks ago.
One player Harvard will have to pay attention to throughout the game is Tiger freshman Erin McMunn, last week’s Ivy League Player of the week. Against Temple on April 4, McMunn set a Princeton record for assists in a game with six in addition to scoring a goal. McMunn followed that up three days later with a goal and two assists in Princeton’s win over Yale.
The Crimson has shared two common opponents with the Tigers this season—Yale and the University of Virginia. While the Crimson’s game against Yale was a close match that resulted in a 7-5 Harvard victory, the Tigers soundly handled the Bulldogs, defeating them, 12-4. Princeton also bested the Cavaliers, 9-7, while the Crimson fell to Virginia, 12-6.
Despite the Tigers’ success, Harvard hasn’t been thinking too much about Princeton–practice this week has been all about its own game strategy.
“We’re going into practice these next few days really focused on fixing the small stuff,” said VanderMeulen, who scored two goals in the Crimson’s 10-4 win over Holy Cross on Wednesday night. “We’re kind of more focusing on ourselves and kind of preparing ourselves for this game.”
As if the postseason implications didn’t make Saturday’s matchup intense enough already, it is also a rematch of last year’s Ivy League Tournament championship game. In the 2011 tournament, the Crimson lost to the Tigers, 12-10, after leading by a goal with just over 10 minutes to play.
“Losing in the final game of the tournament is no fun,” VanderMeulen said. “We don’t want that same feeling, and we’ve been working hard to get that game back, and I think Saturday will be a great opportunity to get us a little bit of redemption.”
Halpern echoed her teammate’s sentiments.
“[Losing last year] is just another thing to give us ammunition for this game,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She performs stunning feats of physical prowess in front of hundreds of fans. Under the gaze of the cheering crowd, she exhibits her body’s capabilities week after week. When she falters, her mistakes, her pain, her sweat, her tears are all on display under the lights of the arena or the gymnasium.
She spends her days perfecting her art, her craft, her skill, her game. She focuses on every muscle, works each inch of her body until it hurts and until it doesn’t hurt anymore. Her body has a job to do.
She plays the same game the men play. She has worked hard for her spot on the field or the ice or the court, and she knows it is hers.
She is the female athlete, and she has a secret. Her weight.
TIPPING THE SCALES
The rosters on GoCrimson.com for Harvard’s varsity sports teams list the weights of men’s baseball, basketball, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, and volleyball players. For the equivalent women’s teams, the rosters have no column for players’ weights.
This policy of publishing men’s weights but not women’s is by no means unique to Harvard. All Ivy League schools do the same, as do most colleges and some high schools.
The only women’s sports league at any level known for publicly disclosing players’ weights is the WNBA. Even there, the weight spot on the roster remains blank for a few players on almost all the teams in the league.
The athletic department’s decision to leave women’s poundage off the roster reflects a much weightier constellation of concerns about body image, eating disorders, privacy, and equal treatment of female athletes. Most women on sports teams say that whether or not they are comfortable with their own body size, they are happier with it off the internet. But for a few, the omission of a statistic that men’s rosters include represents a failure in the decades-long push for equality for female athletics.
WOMEN AT RISK
“When you’re talking to girls, one of the things you’ve always been told not to do is ask them about their weight,” says Keith Wright. As a senior basketball player, Wright says he’s used to seeing his weight listed publicly—even as a secondary school player when he worried that he needed to lose weight in order to keep up with his smaller teammates—but he would never expect the same of his female counterparts.
Assistant Director of Athletics Kurt K. Svoboda agrees, “It probably speaks to a larger issue of social conformity or norms and what is discussed and what isn’t.”
Whether they play a sport or not, college women confront images of super-thin magazine models and movie stars that set a standard for female beauty nationwide. Compounded with the intense competitive drive and the capacity to push one’s physical limits that female athletes hone, elite sports players are much more susceptible to unhealthy attitudes toward their body size than the general population. Top female college athletes are more than twice as likely to develop dangerous eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia compared to the general college-age female population, according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. As many as a third of women who play Division I sports in college show symptoms that put them at risk for anorexia, ESPN reported.
With these stark statistics illustrating that many women who don Crimson jerseys might be in danger of harmful self-starvation or purging­­—behaviors that can cause problems ranging from stress fractures to intestinal damage to fatal heart irregularities—Harvard’s athletics staff keeps a watchful eye on female players’ body images.
“It’s the culture for women that we live in. It’s the media; it’s the modelling—the culture in our world is so different and damaging for women than for men,” says Kathy Delaney-Smith. In her 30 years coaching Harvard’s women’s basketball team, she adds, “I’ve had a lot of my share of eating disorders.”
She talks to her players about what she terms “performance weight,” the ideal weight that would help each woman do best on the court. But those conversations are minimal.
Senior women’s basketball player Brogan Berry says that on the rare occasions when she and her teammates have been weighed by the athletic department, the trainers do not even show them their weights.
“Female body image is always still a huge problem among athletes. I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing that we tend to keep it to ourselves,” Berry says. “I don’t know many female athletes who would be willing to put their weight on a public roster.”
LYING FOR THE LIST
The weight of almost every male athlete is listed on the Harvard athletic department’s website. If a player does not want to be listed, according to Svoboda, he can indicate his preference to be omitted from the roster altogether. He cannot be on the roster without listing his weight.
When Svoboda writes press releases for the Department of Athletics, he says, he commonly mentions male players’ weights alongside background information like their hometowns.
Just because these statistics are easily available and widely distributed, though, does not mean they are true.
“There are many people who list their weights in the program as 10 pounds above what their actual weights are,” says junior men’s lacrosse player Brad Cappellini. “As a guy and a competitor, you fear the bigger, stronger person more.”
He estimates that up to 75 percent of male players weigh less than the rosters say they do. “I know guys on my team do it. I mean, I’ve done it,” he says.
Svoboda acknowledges that the public height and weight chart might make some players squirm. “Whether you’re talking about males or females, there are people who are conscious of their body types,” he says.
But in men, this anxiety more often springs from concern that their bodies are not perfectly suited to athletic performance than that they don’t look good enough.
“A guy feels secure, has a stronger sense of self, when he sees next to his name a weight that...makes him successful at his sport,” Cappellini says.
For Cappellini, the fact that women’s weights are not listed indicates that women do not derive pride in their weights for the same reason men do. “Society,” he says about women, “doesn’t make them change their body weight to affect their sport. It makes them want to adapt to a social standard.”
Sophomore women’s rugby player Brandy Machado says, “There seems to be pressure to be very small, and I think that’s less about performance and more just about social pressures for women.”
James Frazier, the director of strength and conditioning for the Department of Athletics, says he has met far more women who come in to training sessions talking about a goal weight that they aim to achieve—nearly always under their current weight, not over it. But he knows that plenty of men fib to increase their weights for the public listing.
SIZING UP THE COMPETITION
Whether the weights on the rosters are strictly accurate or not, coaches and players of men’s teams turn to them frequently as a useful reference.
Before a game, many say that they  often look at the opposing team’s roster to plan Harvard’s defensive configuration.
It is for that reason, women’s soccer coach Ray Leone says, that he keeps not only weight but also height off of his team’s public roster.
“It’s purely just a competitive thing, because they can know who to mark just by the height of them,” Leone says.
But despite the fact that many players say they consult other teams’ rosters as part of their pre-game strategizing, Svoboda is skeptical of the usefulness of that practice, saying that teams have other ways to preview their opponents.
“I’ve heard that, and I kind of chuckle,” he says. “With most sports, you get such a prolonged warm-up period, and there are so few secrets in today’s day and age with video and film, certainly at the Division I level. Is having that information truly helpful? In the 45 minutes of warm-up time, can you pretty much size up, ‘Oh, that center on the basketball team is a mammoth individual?”
WEIGHING THE PROS AND CONS
The strategic benefits of public weight listings may not be a major issue, but the symbolic importance of choosing to provide men’s weights but not women’s is significant to some commentators.
“It’s like the elephant in the room,” says Laura Pappano, the director of the Women’s Sports Leadership Project at Wellesley College. “It’s a loud omission. I think women should be proud of being fit, beautiful, strong athletes.”
Cappellini agrees. “I think that living an athletic lifestyle and making sacrifices to be an athlete—and all that goes along with that—demonstrates that you do have an inherent care for your body,” he says. “There should be naturally a sense of pride that comes along with all that.”
That pride, he thinks, could be reflected by listing women’s weights so that fans, opponents, and recruiters can see.
“You don’t need to have the prettiest body. You need to have the body that’s most efficient, strongest, fastest. Sometimes when we talk about the girls, we’ve lost sight of that,” he says. “Girls work equally as hard as guys as athletes, so why shouldn’t we list their weights? They should be proud of that.”
Many female athletes disagree, saying that it is unnecessary to equally violate privacy in the name of fairness.
“I get the whole, ‘We don’t want to make such distinctions between female and male sports and try to equalize them all,’” senior women’s volleyball player Christine Wu says. But she would not want to see weights online. “People might get uncomfortable.”
Freshman women’s basketball player Kaitlyn Dinkins agrees. “Obviously we work just as hard as the men do,” she says. “We are very conscious about being in shape and being muscular and toned, but I don’t think personally that female athletes would want it. It’s about not being too—I guess ‘manly’ is the term.”
Pappano, who wrote a book on gender disparities in athletics called “Playing with the Boys: Why Separate Is Not Equal in Sports,” agrees that fear of seeming masculine partly lurks behind women’s discomfort with seeing their weights posted in public.
“There’s a long history of efforts to feminize women’s athletics,” Pappano says. “They’re judged by a set of standards that men are not judged by.... They need to be physically attractive in a female way, and yet they need to also be athletic and strong. Culturally, socially, I think it only perpetuates the problem when we hesitate to list weights on rosters.”
Some are glad and others are resentful to see athletic departments make one fact private in the sphere of athletic performance, which is otherwise inherently public.
“Their bodies are on display,” Cappellini says. “If they’re not afraid to get in front of a crowd of 10,000 people at Harvard Stadium, why would they be worried about putting down their weight?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team’s record-breaking 2011-12 season was brought to an official end this week with the squad’s annual banquet at the Harvard Club of Boston. The event marked a wrap-up of the past year—its best moments exemplified in a ten-plus minute highlight video—as well as the official start of next season.
That meant it was time for me, too, to share my final thoughts on 2011-12, and look ahead to 2012-13 as well.
First, there’s this season, as the scores of missed opportunities during Harvard’s first NCAA Tournament appearance in 66 years still raise questions of what could have been.
For example, what if Laurent Rivard, who was on fire all game, had played more than six minutes in the first half?
What if Tommy Amaker hadn’t decided to go small after Kyle Casey picked up his second foul? (At that point, with the score tied at 20, Amaker’s frontcourt consisted of Keith Wright and four guards against a Vandy lineup that contained the 6’11 Festus Ezeli and the 6’7 Jeffrey Taylor. Those two proceeded to collect back-to-back offensive rebounds on the next Comodores possession, Vandy exploded on a 13-3 run before the break, and from there it was a totally different game).
What if the refs hadn’t blown the call on the Oliver McNally “turnover” that he actually threw off a Vanderbilt player with a minute to go?
What if Harvard didn’t make dozens of silly mistakes, like Corbin Miller dribbling the ball off his leg—leading to an easy Jenkins dunk—towards the end of the first half and Casey missing a slam at the beginning of the second?
What if the Crimson had beaten Penn at home in the first place—would it have gotten a higher seed and avoided a “second” round matchup with an uber-talented Commodores squad that was basically the worst possible matchup for it?
Would things have turned out differently? Who knows. But Harvard showed a lot of fight and did itself proud against a Vanderbilt team that will always be the only squad to beat Kentucky on a non-buzzer beater this year.
And so now, it’s time to move on and turn our attention to next season, for Crimson Madness 2012 is only 153 days away.
At the banquet, Amaker mentioned that his overarching goal was to form a men’s basketball dynasty in Cambridge. And his commitment to Harvard has never seemed greater than it has this month, when he turned down the chance to interview for the South Carolina and LSU jobs.
Before getting into that whole dynasty thing, let’s take it one step at a time, and focus on next year: Can Harvard do what the great Penn and Princeton teams routinely did in the 1970s-90s, or what Cornell did from 2008-10, and pull off a three-peat?
Unlike my fellow beat-writer Martin Kessler, I say yes, with the caveat that winning the 2012-13 title will be a far greater challenge than it was this season (and even then, it was hard). The Crimson is losing a lot, starting with its co-captains, Wright and McNally, as well as freshman Corbin Miller, who will take two years off for his LDS mission.
Harvard will miss Wright’s rebounding, production in the paint, and ability to block shots; it will miss McNally’s leadership, heart, and free-throw shooting (the latter of which bailed out the Crimson down the stretch numerous times this past year); and it will miss Miller’s three-point prowess that could change the dynamic of a game at any second.
The team now has gaping holes at the five and the two. At center, Harvard has a ton of guys who could potentially get minutes—sophomore Ugo Okam, freshmen Steve Moundou-Missi, Kenyatta Smith, and Jonah Travis, and incoming freshmen Agunwa Okolie, Mike Hall, and Evan Cummins. Amaker won’t be able to run the offense through anyone in that group, as he did with Wright, but he should nonetheless be able to find one capable starting center.
Ideally, that player would be either Smith, the highly-touted prospect who couldn’t get off the bench this year, or Okam, the seven-footer who has shown flashes of being a defensive game-changer but presently has little offensive polish. But if Okam can learn a post-move or two, his size gives him the possibility of being a dominant Ivy starting center, while Smith is talented enough to be the same. If either steps up and claims the starting job, that would allow Moundou-Missi and Travis to remain high-energy guys off the bench, roles in which they are better suited. Lastly, don’t rule out Okolie, who could step right in and be a significant contributor as a rookie next season.
At shooting guard, I’m sure the coach would love to give junior Christian Webster back his starting job if Webster can revert to his sophomore-year form. But Amaker has also spoken very highly of freshman Wesley Saunders, who won this year’s “most improved player” award at the banquet and who played more and more minutes as the season went on. Saunders is probably already a more talented player offensively than McNally, and if he can improve his shot he has the potential to be a major factor next season. Either way, without Miller, the team is going to badly lack guard depth, with sophomore Matt Brown and incoming freshman Siyani Chambers likely being asked to play big minutes off the bench.
As I’ve written multiple times, my biggest problem with the 2011-12 team was its lack of a go-to scorer, and that’s where I think the losses of Wright and McNally may in a way actually help the team. The offense was a bit too balanced at times this season, especially down the stretch when everyone was hesitant to take the big shot. The losses of two starters should allow Casey to blossom much the way Ian Hummer did this past season for Princeton, when Hummer was asked to play a bigger role in the previously super-balanced Tiger offense following the departures of Kareem Maddox and Dan Mavraides. Casey, who will serve as a 2012-13 co-captain along with Brandyn Curry, has the ability to be the best player in the league, and will likely need to make the leap in his senior season from an 11-and-5 guy to something more like 18-and-9 guy in order to offset the loss of Wright.
Laurent Rivard’s numbers should improve as well, and if he can shoot anywhere near as well as he did against the Commodores on a regular basis, he could be in for a Ryan Wittman-esque junior season. But if Rivard doesn’t become more consistent, the team is badly going to lack a second shooter next season when he goes cold, as the Canadian often did this year. Without Miller, unless Webster returns to form, Harvard could struggle as a team from long range—never a good thing in the Ancient Eight.
Curry, while providing always-necessary veteran leadership at the point, may be asked to play a larger scoring role than he has in the past as well. If Curry can join his fellow returnees in increasing his offensive production to offset the team’s losses, it would greatly ease the burden on whoever replaces Wright and McNally, allowing the two new starters to merely need to provide more of a defensive presence.
Thus, if Casey and Rivard emerge as legitimate number one and two options, respectively, then I still see Harvard as having a great shot at a third conference title—especially if Saunders can find his shot and a starting center emerges who can play good defense and hold his own offensively.
Sure, the Crimson has question marks, but so does everyone else. Around the league, Penn, Yale, and Princeton all lose key pieces (Zack Rosen, Greg Mangano, and Doug Davis, respectively). The Quakers and, to a lesser extent, the Bulldogs, were essentially one-man teams who will need to rebuild without their stars.
But the conference as a whole could be deeper than ever next year. I expect big improvements out of Brown, which will have a new coach and regains star Tucker Halpern (who missed this season with mono) and talented freshman Rafael Maia (deemed ineligible this season by the NCAA). The Bears will possess arguably the most talented starting five in the league next season when those two join Sean McGonagill, Stephen Albrecht, and Andrew McCarthy, all of whom have the potential to be All-Ivy honorees. But as good as Halpern is, are he and what will be essentially a talented freshman center enough to improve a 2-12 team into a conference contender? Probably not.
Columbia should, on paper, also greatly benefit from the return of its star, redshirt senior Noruwa Agho, who lead the league in scoring two years ago. But as I’ve written in the past, the Lions were a team that had a lot of Ewing Theory in them this season, and if they weren’t good with Agho in the past, it’s tough to say they’ll be a contender with him next year, even taking into account vast improvements of Brian Barbour and Mark Cisco.
Cornell should be another improved team, and it will feature a talented pair of athletic forwards in Errick Peck and reigning Rookie of the Year Shonn Miller. But the return of Peck—who missed much of the season with a knee injury—is more than canceled out by the losses of Chris Wroblewski and Andrew Ferry. Barring major improvements from Miller and this year’s breakout guard, Johnathan Gray, it’s unlikely the Big Red will have enough to compete for a title next season.
That leaves Princeton (no, Dartmouth, you don’t get a paragraph), which has Hummer and a lot of question marks. T.J. Bray, Mack Darrow, Brendan Connolly, and Denton Koon all played 32 games and averaged five to seven points this year, so conceivably any of them could break out and become a good second option alongside Hummer. But right now, the Tigers to me look like a team that could be a lot like this year’s Bulldogs squad, with one great low-post presence but a lot of mediocre secondary options.
On the whole, it’s unlikely there will be any dominant team in the league next season. But the Crimson’s trio of Casey, Rivard, and Curry is as good as anyone else’s top three—maybe outside Columbia, who, unlike Harvard, has little other talent—and though we’ll have to wait until the fall to see what next season will bring, a three-peat is a definite possibility, despite what you may read in Kesslemania.
Oh, and as for that dynasty thing? We’ll let Zena Edosomwan and the other Top-100 recruits he plans to bring with him to Cambridge decide that.

YardFest. A hopefully clear sky looks down on a mingling of sweat, mud, and sound. Harvard Yard contains a stage surrounded by everyone from freshmen to seniors. Above, first-years perch precariously on the windowsills of Matthews and Weld, cheering as the performers finish each song. Kind of. Anyway, in just two days students will crowd into the Yard to hear The Nostalgics, Das Racist, 3LAU, and The Cataracts on stage. But until then, here are 10 pump-up songs to get you ready.
10. 2Nite—The Cataracs featuring DEV. This song from our headliner is lesser known, but it has a great beat and varying parts to keep you interested.
9. The Nostalgics—Just to be clear, these guys are awesome. The video's only at number nine because it doesn't have a ton of their music—it's more of an interview. But expect great things from them.
8. Rainbow in the Dark—Das Racist. Great song for dancing. Also, the beginning of the video is pretty cool.
7. Driving Me Crazy—Sam Adams. 2011 Throwback. Last year, we danced our hearts out to this song. Get out in the Yard and relive some memories.
6. Top of the World (featuring DEV)—The Cataracs. This song has a great beat and will be epic for dancing.
5. All You (featuring Waka Flocka & Kaskade)—The Cataracs. The video makes it sounds a little quiet, but just imagine it being blasted through speakers all through our Yard.
4. Power—Das Racist. This is more of a chill song, but part of it has a great beat. Fun fact—listen for the word "cataracts" at 2:32. Weird coincidence. Just try not to listen to anything else being said.
3. All Night Long—3LAU. Yeah, one could listen to this all night long.
2. Synthesizer—The Cataracs. Imagine the bass going wild when they play it in Harvard Yard. Get excited.
1. Bass Down Low—DEV featuring the Cataracs. Listen to it. Love it. Get ready to dance to it.

April 10, 1900: Students Asked To Give Up Rooms and Furniture for Cuban Teachers
A meeting of the undersigned members of Harvard University was held last night in the parlor of Phillips Brooks Memorial to consider the housing of the Cuban teachers who will be in Cambridge for six weeks during the summer. All expenses for instruction and board will be paid by Harvard University, and a subscription to that end will be taken up among the graduates. The women, about 900 in number, will be lodged in the private boarding houses of Cambridge and it will be necessary to find rooms, furniture and bedding for the men in the College dormitories. There will be between five and six hundred of them.
April 11, 1927: Public Schools' Graduates Excel
Two hundred and ninety high school men are scholarship holders at Harvard this year while only 84 men prepared in private schools received these financial aids.
Boston and its vicinity ranks very high; for about 95 undergraduate holders of these awards were prepared in schools in this district. The Boston Latin School heads the list with 34 winners while Cambridge Latin has 22. There are 39 other men from Boston high schools. This large number is offset by the large percentage of undergraduates who prepared in this district, but in spite of that it shows the high standard maintained by these schools.
April 12, 1950: 12,300 Eggs, 3 Tons Ham Kept 'Cliffe Salted in '46
The next time your Radcliffe date murmurs in your ear that a dinner at Locke-Ober's would be nice, ignore her. A recent survey discloses that the average freshman gains from 10 to 15 pounds during her first term, largely on her fare in the Annex dorms.
This isn't so remarkable when one considers that last year 'Cliffe-dwellers polished off five tons of roast lamb, four tons of roast beef, three tons of ham, and almost two tons of butter. As if this weren't enough, they topped it off with 12,300 eggs and close to 300 gallons of ice cream.
April 8, 1968: White and Brown
After the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. last Thursday evening, ghetto-cities across the country braced themselves for large scale riots. Every possible preventive measure was taken to minimize the violence: King's non-violent legacy was invoked; Johnson cancelled his trip to Hawaii and called for unity; a four p.m. curfew was declared in Washington; police, National Guardsmen, and Federal troops poured into the ghettos.
But after a painful summer of experience, a number of government officials had learned that armed repression often did little more than spread the fires of the riot-revolt. In a rare movement of governmental inventiveness Mayor Kevin White produced and directed one of the most daring scenarios in an effort to keep Roxbury off the riot casuality list.
White faced an inflammable situation when he heard that James Brown, king of soul music, was scheduled to perform in Boston Saturday night. To allow the event to occur without intervention would have been to set the stage for a major incident. All the ingredients were there: a large group of young blacks gathered together, King's murderer still on the loose, and the super-charged excitement of Brown's performance to provide the spark. To close the show down, on the other hand, was equally dangerous. There might easily have been a riot if Brown were not permitted to perform because of an order from White's office. Instead, White used the event to his own advantage, making it a city-sponsored production, and televising it a total of three times to keep Boston's Black population at home glued to the tube instead of out throwing bricks in the streets.
April 9, 1969: Students Occupy University Hall, Eject Deans, Staff from Offices
Shortly after noon today, more than 100 demonstrators occupied University Hall. As of 6 p.m., the demonstrators numbering 200—down from 350 at 4 p.m.—were still holding the building.
The demonstrators ejected all Administration officials and staff members from the hall, early in the afternoon, some by force.
Before leaving peacefully at 12:50, Dean Glimp several times told the demonstrators that their continued presence in the hall would subject them to disciplinary action. "You are obstructing the movement of individuals in this building. This alone merits disciplinary action. Furthermore, I am now instructing you to get out of here," Glimp said.

It's that time of year again! National Alcohol Screening Day (NASD) has come, and with it, DAPA and the Office of Alcohol & Other Drug Services are giving away free water bottles with handy information about alcohol consumption printed on the colorful exteriors. You can get your water bottle from now until 5 p.m. on the fourth floor of the MAC.
