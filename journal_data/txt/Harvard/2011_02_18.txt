After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An international relations theory professor once compared President Woodrow Wilson’s approach to democracy with that of President George W. Bush. Post-World War I, Wilson advocated for the self-governance of the peoples that were liberated from Ottoman rule. His approach could be compared to planting a tree:  You introduce the seed of democracy, nurture it, and then watch it flourish. On the other hand, Bush’s post-9/11 approach to democracy was to remove any existing autocratic governing system that harbored hostility toward the U.S.—using force if needed—and replace it with a democracy. This is analogous to digging a hole and then planting a full-grown tree in it. Recent events in Tunis and Egypt, however, show how much better Wilson’s approach to instating democracy was Bush’s approach. Although the damage in Iraq and Afghanistan has been done, there still needs to be a change in policy concerning other autocratic regimes in the area.
American foreign policy had little to do with the Jasmine revolution in Egypt. In fact, the American government was caught off guard and had barely any time to assess the situation. Joe Biden first expressed that he wouldn’t call Mubarak a dictator, but an ally;he later called Mubarak’s resignation a pivotal moment in history. The ambivalence of the American position might just have been the best thing that happened to the revolution. The movement was relatively peaceful—except for violent stunts instigated by Mubarak’s henchmen—and showcased the power of the people to initiate change.
As with Tunisia, the events in Egypt are inciting other grassroots movements toward democracy in the Arab world, and the American government should welcome that. Demonstrations are taking place in Jordan, Bahrain, and Yemen, just to name a few. The State Department should pressure its autocratic allies into instituting fundamental changes to their oppressive regimes. If true democracy were to flourish in the Middle East, U.S.-friendly dictators cannot count on their Western allies to keep them in power, but need to become responsible toward their people.
The main excuse that kept Mubarak—and countless others—in power for three decades was that he was the lesser of two evils. Americans feared the rise of an Islamist fundamentalist regime in Egypt that would undermine the Camp David Accords. Although the U.S. did lose a major ally in the region, there are no indications that any democratically elected government would be hostile toward the U.S. Even the widely feared “Muslim Brotherhood” has worked to alleviate such fears by announcing that it will not field a candidate for presidency. The Brotherhood, a non-violent conservative Islamist movement, aims to create an Islamist state, but whether it has enough popular support has yet to be determined. If all goes well, Egypt should have a democratically elected government within six months.
Such apprehensions should not stop the U.S. from pushing toward reforms in other Arab nations that are witnessing peaceful protests calling for reforms. Arabs are calling for legitimate rights that include freedom of speech, better standards of life, and a fair judicial system. If the U.S. genuinely wants to spread democracy in the world, it should start by pressuring their allies into making concessions to their oppressed peoples as a first step to long-term change.
Condoleezza Rice once explained to Arabs that “the birth pangs of a new Middle East” was Israel’s anti-Hezbollah war on Lebanon. However, the 2006 war failed to change the status quo between the two countries, and her “new Middle East” was stillborn. New birth pangs now seem to have hit that region, but they don’t include missiles, bombs, and tanks. They are the dead and injured of Tahrir Square, Pearl Square, and all pro-democracy protests, and they will bring in the birth of a new Middle East.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask a freshman to point out a good Lit B course, and he or she will probably look as if you asked them to identify a gramophone. The Core Program will reach extinction after the class of 2012 graduates, and with it will go any recollection of the 11 categories over which many juniors and seniors still agonize. Ninety percent of seniors and 50 percent of juniors are still on the Core program. Three hundred of these students petitioned for departmental courses to count for Core credit this year, and, as the number of courses primarily intended for the Core dwindles, the College should exercise lenience in evaluating petitions for departmental courses to count for the Core.
As the student body switches from the Core’s mentality of intending “to introduce students to the major approaches to knowledge,” to the Gen Ed one of connecting course material to “life outside the ivied walls,” the learning process has grown more confusing for students on the Core. For example, while only three courses still include “Literature and Arts A” in their title, 19 General Education courses—categorized as Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding, Culture and Belief, or Foreign Culture—also count for this Core. From our experience, it is now possible to fulfill this requirement and graduate from Harvard without having closely read a text or without having written a substantive essay of literary analysis, as one would be required to do in the one remaining pure Literature and Arts A “The Book of Job and the Joban Tradition.” Now, however, students can engage in more creative projects that, while valuable, neglect the sorts of skills Harvard’s curriculum used to inculcate.
There are students who are dedicated to the Core philosophy and are satisfied and happy adding to their “ways of knowing.” For these undergraduates, being stuck in the middle of a methodological shift is frustrating. Since the Faculty approved the Core in 1978 until it approved Gen Ed in 2007, the College purported that understanding the methods of different disciplines was the best way to educate students in a general manner.
Although there are certainly students still in the Core who simply want to finish their general requirements, and do not care through which pedagogical lens they do this, the fact that some juniors and seniors are still convinced of the Core’s merits should not be surprising. The College should plan accordingly.
Also, human resources for Core students have also significantly diminished. In June 2009, the director of the Core Program retired, and, in May 2010, the assistant director of the program left.
Although the shift from Core to Gen Ed took years for the faculty to deliberate—an initial brainstorming booklet entitled “Essays on General Education in Harvard College” was published in 2004—for the class of 2011 and 2012, it happened suddenly. In order to make up for this confusing bureaucratic change, the College should be lenient in evaluating Core petitions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend I had the wonderful opportunity to watch The Battle of Chile, celebrated Chilean filmmaker Patricio Guzmán’s epic three-part documentary, screened at the Harvard Film Archive. Four and a half hours long, black and white, shot in the streets cinema verité-style over the years 1975-79, it covers the 1972 socialist government of Salvador Allende and its overthrow by military coup d’etat. Bobbing and weaving through the crowds, the camera is drawn to extreme close-ups of the workers and politicians interviewed by Guzmán and his five-person crew.
The film was impressive, but particularly striking to me was the way it covered leftist infighting—despite broad support for Allende—during the months leading up to the coup. Yesterday afternoon, I spoke with Guzmán through a translator, curious about his insights as to what relevance the events of 1972-3 might have for today’s events in Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, and other countries. One of the challenges in the region is that those agitating have not yet agreed on a coherent positive narrative: Unlike with the 1952 socialist revolution in Egypt, nationalist movements have not tended to coalesce around a charismatic personage like Nasser. Broad sentiment has yet to be channeled into a productive storyline—while the general consensus is in favor of democracy, the region remains in flux.
Guzmán, too, had been following the events closely. On the surface, of course, the situations are very different: “Allende wanted to bring about change. He brought the people great happiness, and had the support of 43 percent of the population. The right was just very strong, and very smart. In contrast, the Arab world is against dictatorship. There has been no democratic government, from Syria to Morocco. It is a revolution of rage.” What the two situations have in common however, Guzmán said, is “popular power.” As for what to do next, “there is no straight answer. No one knows how to make a revolution.”
The Battle of Chile is not subtle about its political commitments. Guzmán supplements the events with a voiceover throughout—a point that irritated Pauline Kael in her generally glowing 1978 New York Times review of a dubbed first two parts. “The film seems to give us only the public actions—and none of the inner workings,” she wrote. “Those are supplied by an English narrator (a woman) who keeps interpreting for us. There may be considerable truth here, but this kind of thing can drive one a little crazy.” In the HFA version, the narration is done by Guzmán himself, in Spanish.
It is difficult to know quite what Kael wanted: How exactly does one show “inner workings” on film? Any choice of attention, too, is an interpretation. In fact, the narration seems to be one of the film’s more brilliant aspects. A documentary film usually consists of impassioned events, with facts or data provided by a dispassionate narrator; Guzmán instead focuses on occurrences as everyday as parliamentary discussions, overlaying them with fervent analysis. The events he covers are dramatic, but his focus—particularly in the third part—is on the process of building. Guzmán didn’t remember Kael’s criticism, but had this to say: “The Battle of Chile is not meant to be objective. My sympathies for the socialism of Allende were always clear. It is impossible to explain everything through images, so I give the analysis. But it is meant to orient the spectator; it is the spectator who sees his past and can decide what he thinks.”
In any case, to remain objective would have been artificial. During the process of filming, Guzmán’s Argentine cameraman is fatally shot. A policeman is filmed pointing his gun at a passerby; the gun points toward the camera; the camera falls, and, suddenly, all we see is sky. End part one.
The personal blow encouraged Guzmán to work even harder at drawing out what he calls the “invisible facts.” He gave an example of what he means: “During Popular Unity, workers barricaded the street. There was radio, TV, film cameras. These were the ‘visible facts.’ But nobody filmed why it was happening. There must have been reasons to protest. To get there, there must have been debates, whether good or bad. There must have been political questions. It’s interesting when you have a plural left—at that time, there were seven parties on the left!—and they come together to agree. It means the agreement was authentic: It had real weight.”
The only way for Egypt and other countries in the Middle East to move forward is for them to construct a coherent account of their own past and future. A charismatic leader is one way to bring various causes together—ultimately, a leader is necessary to unite people and make reform possible. Guzmán thinks that the presence of Allende was “absolutely crucial” to bring together various political factions. “There were discrepancies on the left, and there were would not have been unity without Allende,” he said.
But another means of providing a coherent narrative of the past is through artistic projects, ones that unite polemic and poetry in creative ways to discover the “invisible facts.” As Guzmán writes on his website: “For decades, a part of documentary film was incarcerated in the prison of realism… today it isn’t enough to accumulate facts and data. Those that move within that space will never be able to show us the non-visible reality that Cervantes or Kafka saw. One must go farther: teach what we do not know, show what we cannot see. Our Latin American culture (Indigenous, Black, European, Jewish, Arab) no longer fits in with a demand for one reality only. To take advantage of this richness leads to the amplification of the word ‘documentary.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July, I sat in Zamalek, Cairo, uploading photos of the pyramids to my Facebook account. I thought of that moment often last week as Egyptians used Facebook to help organize their stunning revolution to cast down President Hosni Mubarak. The protesters found a variety of uses for social media even as Mubarak’s camp opted for the timeless tactic of repressive brutality and blunt force. Each breaking story, anecdote, and photo of the chaos in Cairo, protesters and journalists helped sustain the momentum of change; many of us had to wonder whether the tweet was now mightier than the sword. In the fallout of Mubarak’s ouster, however, one sees signs of great change in the age of Twitter. Yet we must also remember the age-old blood price that comes with even social media-savvy revolutions.
With Internet at times restricted by the government, it was certainly a struggle for the Egyptian people and the reporters covering the story to disseminate information on each development in the city. Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 and others were on the scene, providing coverage while Mubarak’s police and paid supporters attempted to block their work and smash equipment. America’s first face of disaster and crisis reporting, Anderson Cooper, was attacked and punched, in just one example of attacks on journalists on the scene—and not just by the government. A violent element of the protesters, of course, subjected CBS News correspondent Lara Logan to a horrific beating and sexual assault the night of Mubarak’s ouster. While a disgusting crime that reminds us not all the protesters were peaceful or respectful of human rights, this act was not indicative of the actions of the Cairo people through the protests.
That vast majority faced days of attacks and harassment as the government cut Internet access and tried to keep the world in the dark. Yet social media made it impossible to control the message. New services and ways to use old ones continued to thwart the government’s efforts. When Mubarak blocked Twitter, Google and Twitter quickly developed Speak2Tweet, which allowed Egyptians to call in tweets as voicemails. Journalists also resorted to back-door methods known more in the United   States as a celebrity tactic—remote tweets relayed to friends and family to be posted on their behalf.
Social media also certainly helped protesters to coordinate and provide each other with emotional support surprising even to one of the world’s foremost experts on modern Middle Eastern politics. Last September, I discussed the controversy of a photoshopped image of Mubarak with E. Roger Owen, A.J. Meyer Professor of Middle East History and former Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. With the recent revolution, Owen now agrees that social media has clearly been a major factor, with Facebook leading the way.
“It was very important for the Egyptian young people for a while, being able to coordinate and keep up spirits through [Facebook],” Owen told me.
Tunisia’s trendsetting use of technology has led some to call its result a “Twitter revolution.” Jillian York of Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society has encapsulated that argument well in a recent blog entry. York, however, argues that the feting of social media platforms as catalysts of Tunisian revolution must not diminish our recognition of the human successes and sacrifices of that movement.
Owen also recently stressed to me the human component of those two successful civilian revolts. Social media served as a valuable tool, but it was not the deciding catalyst in Egypt. And soon enough, protesters faced bricks and various homemade missiles in a struggle that could be bloody, brutal, and grounded in practices that predate social media by centuries.
Whether from Mubarak thugs or the reprehensible fringe of the anti-government crowds in Cairo, scenes of violence widely occurred. Inspired by Egypt (as Egypt was inspired by Tunisia), Iran, Bahrain, and Yemen have seen protests and also serious violence.
Social media can only help those protesters so much. Its value in organizing people is clear, and it makes it impossible for governments to keep the world in the dark of their reprisals. Yet as reports now indicate at least nineteen dead in Libya’s latest “Day of Anger” yesterday, it is clear that tweets cannot save one from the bullets. As we continue to debate the role of social media in these events, we should stop to ask—how difficult is it to use such technology and peaceful methods in the face of widespread violence? Those of us who use Facebook just for photos and chatting with friends might not have answered that call. Perhaps our fascination with the role social media has played in these revolutions is based in our inability to ever truly know.

A Middle East composed of democratically elected governments will dramatically alter the behavior of the Israeli government and change the terms of an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, said Middle East experts Daniel Levy and Amjad Atallah in a J Street U Harvard-sponsored talk yesterday in Sever Hall.
“This is an opportunity to move to a legitimate peace, but it means not doing things in the same way,” said Atallah, a former adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team.
Atallah and Levy, a former Israeli negotiator, are co-directors of the Middle East Task Force for the New America Foundation, a public policy think tank.
The discussion’s focus on the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, hosted by the Harvard chapter of the liberal Jewish advocacy group J Street, was altered to address the effect of the ongoing upheaval across the Arab world on the peace process.
Over the past weeks, uprisings have swept through numerous Middle Eastern countries, changing the political landscape.
Protests in Egypt, a prominent ally of the Israeli and U.S. government, led Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to resign last Friday, sparking concerns about the future of its relations with Israel.
But Levy countered concerns that a new government in Egypt would result in severed ties to Israel.
“I think the last thing an Egypt in transition wants, that the military wants, is to test themselves against Israel,” he said.
Further dismissing concerns that the uprisings would result in anti-Israel sentiment, Atallah said that even if protesters across the region are not pro-Israeli, they are not necessarily anti-Israeli.
“What’s there is a public that recognizes that they can make peace with Israel in some future sense,” Atallah said.
But a future peace necessitates change in the position of the Israeli government, he said.
“It is also absolutely, totally clear that the idea that Israel gets to continue occupation, or that Israel gets to humiliate Palestinians, or that Israel gets to continue having discriminatory treatment against non-Jews­­­­—that [the Arab protesters] are not going to tolerate,” Atallah said.
“And I think that creates a much more difficult situation for an Israeli government that is predicated on ... everybody out there is bad and we are good,” he added.
The current climate in the Middle East will result in a “collapse of the peace process as we know it,” Levy said. “And I welcome that.”

Harvard University Health Services may have to make adjustments to its insurance offerings based on a decision last week by the Department of Health and Human Services that college health insurance plans must adhere to regulations contained in the Affordable Care Act.
Harvard’s Director of Federal Relations Suzanne Day said that universities are unique because the student health insurance offered plans offered do not fit neatly into the most common categories of employee plans and individual plans, and that, therefore, university plans were overlooked during health care reform.
Previously, college health insurance plans were exempt from the provisions of the health-care overhaul bill because consumers of college plans are generally adults between the ages of 17 and 30 years, who, by and large, do not require coverage for many ailments associated with advanced age.
According to critics of the new rule, the requirements of the recently passed health care reform bill are not necessarily appropriate for generally healthy young adults.
HUHS is currently in the process of reviewing the proposal, according to HUHS Director Dr. David S. Rosenthal ’59.
Rosenthal said that HUHS “routinely evaluate[s] our student health plan offerings to determine how to best meet our students’ needs.”
“HUHS is now beginning to evaluate these proposed regulations to determine their goals for student plans,” Rosenthal wrote in an e-mail.
In a letter to the White House in August, the American College Health Association—along with the American Council on Education and other organizations—wrote that certain insurance market reforms and the individual mandate, “could make it impossible for colleges and universities to continue to offer student health plans.”
The Department of Health and Human Services’ provisions include prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to students under 19 because of a pre-exising condition, and from dropping coverage when a student health plan enrollee becomes ill.
“This rule would ensure that these plans remain a viable, affordable option for students while guaranteeing that they are regulated consistently and offer transparent benefits to students,” said Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in a press release.
Harvard is in a unique position because Massachusetts already requires colleges and universities to offer student health insurance as part of its stipulation that all residents have coverage, and therefore already has in place regulations for university health insurance programs, according to Suzanne Day.
“We are looking for consistent standards across the board rather than two sets of potentially differing requirements,” Day said.

Ten renowned Harvard professors ranging in disciplines from neuroscience to American literature spoke to a rapt audience in a packed Sanders Theater last night at the second annual Harvard Thinks Big forum.
The event, which was hosted by Zachary H. Richner ’11 and Peter D. Davis ’12, gave ten professors ten minutes to discuss an idea about which they are passionate. The night saw exploration of topics ranging from the relationship between time and music to the possibility of the existence of a fifth dimension.
Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig kicked off the evening with a discussion of how to preserve the American democracy. Lessig said that American politicians are too concerned with lobbyists’ interests and do not pay enough attention to their constituents’ needs.
“We have to convince a reluctant nation to wage a war to save democracy,” he told the audience, quoting President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a member of the Class of 1904 and a former Crimson president.
Richard Beaudoin, a composer and music lecturer, discussed how people experience music as a function of time, demonstrating his points with poignant excerpts on the piano. Beaudoin pioneered a new type of music called “musical photorealism,” in which he deconstructs and slows down recordings of iconic musical performances and then interweaves them with other musical pieces.
Professor Tarek Masoud touched on current civil unrest in Egypt, engaging with the question of the possibility of democracy in the Arab world. Masoud, who noted that he had been in Egypt just four days before the riots erupted, firmly supported the idea that the Arab world is ready for democratic governance.
History Professor and Pulitzer Prize Winner Caroline Elkins told the story of researching her controversial graduate dissertation, which focused on ethnic tensions in Kenya in the 1950s. After publishing her dissertation, she faced the dilemma of whether or not to testify on behalf of the Kenyan people.
Ultimately, she decided to do so against the urgings of many of her colleagues.
In addition to the professors presentations, this year’s Harvard Thinks Big had a new element.
Just before the intermission, the event’s organizers screened a five minute video in which Harvard undergraduate students’ ideas were highlighted. These ideas ranged from students who wanted to create websites that would allow for neighbors to easily build a sense of community to organizing time for Harvard students to de-stress during the week by creating a space in which they can play with legos and blocks.
Professors and students alike said that they enjoyed the event.
“I think it was a big success,” said Professor Lisa Randall.
Davis, who also organized Harvard Thinks Big last year, said he was pleased with the event.
“We all felt good about it,” said Davis. “We had ten great professors.”
Davis said he was delighted with what he referred to as the increased legitimacy of this years Harvard thinks big, and that he hopes to make the event a new Harvard tradition.
He also said he wants students take away an important message from the event, that they too can think big.
“I hope that they don’t think they are surrounded by great ideas,” Davis said. “I hope that the think that they, themselves, have great ideas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cassandra N. Bowe ’11 dropped four classes and added two classes right in time for Tuesday’s add/drop deadline.
“I thought it was no big deal that I could do whatever I wanted with my classes this semester,” she says. “My resident dean thought it was perhaps a little more drastic than I did.”
Yet Bowe says she got the signature of her resident dean, which she needed to change her course schedule. Although Bowe has been attending lectures for her new classes since the week after shopping period, she will not be formally enrolled in them until her paperwork is processed, four weeks after the start of the semester.
Because Presidents’ Day falls on Monday, this semester’s add/drop deadline is next Tuesday, a day later than the usual deadline—the fifth Monday of the semester.
While students enjoy the late add/drop deadline—which gives them the freedom to change their course load several weeks into the semester—some say there are problems with the system.
Some students who have added a course near the add/drop deadline say it can be challenging to do well after missing the first four weeks of class, and others say it can be hard to even find professors willing to admit them so late in the semester.
A FORGIVING DEADLINE
The College extends the add deadline later into the term than most colleges, but its drop deadline falls in the middle of the pack, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
As of the no-fee add/drop deadline on Feb. 7—which falls on the third Monday of the semester—students had added or dropped “close to 2,100 courses,” according to Registrar Michael P. Burke.
He adds that this figure represents fewer than 2,100 students, since many students dropped one class in order to add another.
Burke says he expects even more students to add or drop a course by Tuesday’s final deadline.
Although the College allows students to take advantage of the late deadline, administrators question the advisability of adding courses so late into the semester.
Harris says he thinks that students almost always decrease their odds of success by adding a course after missing weeks of classes.
“I’d say, in almost any case, that this is not wise,” he says.
Lecturer on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Andrew Berry, who is an academic advisor, says he has signed about 15 add/drop forms in the past few weeks.
About half of these students have simply dropped from five courses to four—effectively “extending shopping period beyond one week to three or four weeks”—he says.
But for advisees who are adding a new course near the add/drop deadline, Berry says he recommends that they play to their academic strengths.
“If they’re adding a course that they already have a strong background in, the first few weeks are probably not too vital,” he says.
Students who have been sitting in on class lectures before completing the official paperwork—essentially auditing the course—usually have less trouble catching up to speed, he adds.
ADDING AT THE DEADLINE
Bowe says that in a previous semester, she added a Literature C course near the deadline to fulfill a Core requirement.
She says that although her teaching fellow tried to help her make up the work, Bowe says she never truly caught up with the workload.
“In a class I didn’t know much about, I thought I got off on the wrong foot,” she says. “I felt like I was really at a disadvantage the rest of the semester.”
A freshman—who asked to remain anonymous in order to avoid jeopardizing her chance of getting into courses—says she must now find two new classes by Tuesday’s deadline, after dropping an intensive language course that was moving too fast for her.
The freshman says she is worried about succeeding in the courses she chooses, after missing the first four weeks of lecture.
“It’s intimidating starting a class and not knowing what to expect and if you’ll catch up on time,” she says. “I feel like I’m in so much trouble.”
Shelby M. MacLeod ’12 says she is so concerned about making up missed work that she has never added or dropped a course at Harvard.
Even though she is taking a Visual and Environmental Studies course that she says she is dissatisfied with, she does not plan to drop it because she thinks it would be too difficult to make up four weeks of missed work.
“I feel like it would be more effort to catch up in another class than to just stick with this one,” she says.
FINDING THE COURSE
Although the Committee on Undergraduate Education has discussed making changes to the add/drop deadline, no alterations have been put in motion.
“The feeling has been that [the add/drop deadlines] have to be the same,” says Harris.
There could be repercussions to separating the two deadlines, he says.
“I think it would certainly mean more students enrolling in five [courses] and dropping, and that has consequences for enrollment management and rooms and sections,” he says. “I certainly wouldn’t want to encourage that.”
But Harris says that the late deadline to add a course can be difficult for students who do not realize that professors must approve any add forms after study card day.
“I do think our add deadline is too late,” says Harris, who sets his own deadline for allowing students to add his courses.
“I’ll let anybody in in the second week,” he says. “I’ve made one or two exceptions, but I won’t let anybody in in the fourth week, and the third week I negotiate.”
On the other hand, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and of Physics Adam E. Cohen ’01—who is teaching Physical Sciences 1: “Chemical Bonding, Energy, and Reactivity: An Introduction to the Physical Sciences” this semester—says he thinks the extended add/drop deadline gives students the flexibility to adjust their class schedule if needed.
“It’s good for the system to have built in special arrangements for students whose circumstances are unusual,” he says.
However, the freshman who is searching for two new courses says she wishes she had been better informed about the process earlier in the semester.
“I’ve e-mailed a lot of professors and they said that they already had to cap enrollment, or that they’d rather not let someone in this late, or ‘thank you for your interest, but no,’” she says. “I would probably have tried switching courses earlier if I knew I’d be in such a jam and looking for a long time for courses and not having any.”
She says she thinks the administration should be more up front about the difficulties of adding a course this close to the add/drop deadline.
“If it’s just a myth that add/drop period is actually four weeks and it’s actually three—or two—let people know,” she says. “It affects decisions.”

A student campaign to end Harvard’s investments in HEI Hotels & Resorts—a hotel company that includes Hilton and Marriott properties that has been accused of violating workers’ rights—has gained momentum recently after Brown University President Ruth Simmons announced earlier this week that Brown will end future investment in the company.
Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement launched a campaign against HEI in 2008 but largely abandoned the mission because the University was unresponsive.
United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS)—a national advocacy group that has assisted students in organizing protests at their schools—has alleged that HEI has repeatedly violated workers’ rights, including unfairly increasing workload. USAS has worked on a campaign to end investment in HEI for nearly three years.
SLAM is currently in the process of drafting a recommendation to the University’s Advisory Committee on Shareholder Responsibility that Harvard not reinvest in HEI. But the University has remained silent on its plans with respect to the investment.
“While we do not generally discuss individual investments or investment strategies, Harvard has a strong institutional presumption against divesting stock for reasons unrelated to investment purposes,” said University spokesperson John D. Longbrake in a statement.
Though Harvard’s exact investment in HEI is unknown, SLAM estimates that it is over $70 million. HEI accrued over $1 billion in endowment equity placements from 2004-2008, including money from Yale, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, and Notre Dame, according to USAS.
“This is an irresponsible corporation and it does not reflect the values of a university,” said Vicko Alvarez a campus coordinator for USAS. Alvarez said that students should not back down even if the University “gives all of the excuses that [divestment] cannot be done, that it is impossible.”
At Notre Dame students participated in a hunger strike, and Yale students staged a sit-in in the investments office, according to USAS. Brown students marched in University Hall with vacuums and mops to “clean up Brown’s investments,” and acted out a mock wedding between Brown’s Investment Office and “HEI’s Corporate Greed.”
On Sunday Simmons sent an e-mail to Brown students pledging to end future investment in HEI, USAS said.
Alvarez said she believes that Harvard students are in a position to build off of the campaigns at other universities.
SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14 said that this campaign is  “an especially obvious manifestation of a larger campaign for transparency.”
Whitham said he believes the University needs to be held accountable for the social costs of its investments. “These investments effect people. They are not just numbers,” he said. “If Brown can do it, why can’t Harvard?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The debate over whether the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program should return to Harvard continued last night with a student debate sponsored by the Harvard Political Union. Arguments over whether the program ought to be recognized by the University continued to center around the Pentagon’s policy toward transgender and intersex-identified individuals.
The conversation—which included about 25 students—focused on Congress’ recent repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which prohibited gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual individuals from openly serving in the military, and whether that ought to bring an end to Harvard’s 40-year standoff with ROTC.
“President Drew Faust acknowledged that Harvard would be receptive to welcoming ROTC back to campus, but current barriers to Harvard’s official recognition of ROTC include a lack of student interest and a potential violation of Harvard’s non-discrimination policy,” said Sidhant Misra ’14, adding that transgender and intersex-identified individuals are currently excluded from enlisting in the military.
Representing the Harvard Republican Club, Derek J. Bekebrede ’13 sparked debate by stating that ROTC should be recognized on campus to honor students serving their country. Contention surfaced as students deliberated whether acknowledgement of a military program constitutes appreciation for public service.
“Harvard should promote public service, but supporting the military as a particular form of service is problematic. Not everything the military does constitutes public service,” said Christian C. Anderson ’13.
The debate then shifted to whether the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” has ended discrimination in the military.
Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14, a Crimson editorial editor, said that although the lifting of the ban now allows gay and lesbian individuals to openly serve in the military, inequity remains.
“As a student organization, ROTC would violate anti-discrimination policy. Transgender and intersex people are labeled with gender identity disorder and not allowed to serve at all,” Korn said. “Discrimination against a small minority is still discrimination.”
Another issue brought to the fore focused on whether ROTC should return to its historical roots or continue to provide students with the opportunity to participate in the program and enroll in courses at MIT, as the program currently functions.
“Should ROTC be reincarnated as it was in history?” Anderson said. “Harvard would not take a neutral stance but an affirmative stance and overstep its bounds if it were to accept ROTC.”
For now, debate persists about whether ROTC should return to Harvard, and the program remains unrecognized by the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across from Cambridge Commons stands an old, almost forgotten, companion of Harvard. As old as Harvard itself, the First Church in Cambridge is celebrating its 375th anniversary this month.
Harvard and First Church’s partnership dates back to 1636, when both were founded. According to Stephen P. Shoemaker, an expert on the history of the College, the University gave up an offer to build on 300 acres of land in Salem, Mass. to be closer to the pastor of First Church, Thomas Shepherd. University founders wanted Shepherd to oversee the school and “maintain its theological purity.”
But during its early years, the University experienced much instability. In the 1639-40 academic year, Harvard was forced to close its doors because students refused to enroll due to the discovery of inedible food and administrator abuse the year before.
“And all of this happened with the minister of the First Church right next door,” Shoemaker says.
Throughout its long history as Harvard’s neighbor, First Church’s relationship with the University has gradually grown more distant. But, for its parishioners, First Church has remained an institution both steeped in history and committed to a progressive theological agenda.
AN INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP
As part of an anniversary lecture series, Shoemaker led a discussion in January at the First Church, where he described the church’s longtime connection to Harvard as intimate, “almost incestuous.”
Many of Harvard’s early presidents served as ministers of First Church. The University’s first, second, and fourth presidents—Henry Dunster, Charles Chauncy, and Urian Oakes—all served as ministers during their respective presidencies.
All members of the Harvard community—tutors, professors, and students—were required to attend services at First Church on Sundays and daily prayers until 1814, when the University began shifting from Trinitarian beliefs to Unitarian.
In response, some members stopped attending First Church and founded the First Parish Church in Cambridge with the help of funds from Harvard.
“After the split the relationship was fundamentally changed forever,” Shoemaker says.
ADAPTING TO HISTORY
As its relationship with the University changed, First Church also experienced several moves, switching locations six times over the past 200 years. Before settling into its current location on Garden Street, First Church was located on the corner of Mt. Auburn and Dunster Streets—the current location of the J. Press store—and has also resided where Lehman Hall now stands.
First Church has also been witness to many major historical events. In 1757, George Washington made a stop in Cambridge and worshipped in the church during the Revolutionary War.
During the Vietnam War, the church, as a sign of protest, covered a cross sitting on top of the altar with a black veil. That decision caused significant controversy among its members, some of whom left.
“We have grown to be open and flexible and have endeavored to be relevant to what’s going on at any given moment,” says Dan Smith, the current minister.
According to Smith, the church has been on the forefront of changing times, being open to gay couples since the early 1990s. Ten years later, the church inducted its first openly gay female minister, Mary Luti.
A COMMUNITY WITHIN
Though the church’s relationship with the University has been strained at some points, First Church has formed other life-long companions throughout the years.
Perry Neubauer and his wife, Susan have attended the church since the early 1960s.
“It’s my family, we don’t live geographically close to our family. They are not just a community, but family. My most meaningful experiences happened with this community,” says Susan, who is short in stature and always bears a slight smile.
“The spirit of the place is contagious,” adds Perry, who wears a green beret highlighting the whiteness of his hair.
Both life-long churchgoers, the Neubauers first decided to join First Church because of its convenient location and the quality of its choir.
As an architecture student at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, Perry helped remodel the interior of the church during renovations in the 1970s. He says he redesigned the sanctuary, bringing in a newer organ and communion table, and created a more open environment for congregational worship.
Over the years, the Neubauers have held leadership roles in almost every aspect of the church—chairing the grounds committee, serving as deacons, and participating in fellowship and the choir, where Susan is a soprano.
“It’s a full time job being a member of this church,” Perry says with a laugh.
“In churches, synagogues, or mosques you get to do the most important things of your life there,” Susan says. “You baptize your kids, memorialize people, and strengthen ties with the community.”
“Having this amazingly rich and long tradition has created a foundation for a community that can add a sense of stability,” Smith says. He explained that the church continues to uphold its traditions by reciting the original covenant every Sunday morning.
The church has also provided solace for its parishioners during times of upheaval.
Perry, holding back tears, recalled the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the comfort the church community provided.
“The night before we had prepared the hymn ‘How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place.’ When Jack Kennedy died we were so heart broken,” Perry says.
Minister Smith says that commitment to the community will remain a cornerstone of the Church’s mission, by being mindful of historical events and adaptations to modern times.
“My legacy is to keep the church relevant to our pluralistic context and to a time where a counter-cultural voice of social justice is needed in society,” Smith says.

In a modest corner office tucked away behind the galleries of the Harvard Museum of Natural History, executive director Elisabeth A. Werby ’72 is getting ready to pack her boxes and leave Harvard next Wednesday.
Werby, who has worked at the museum for five and a half years, has accepted a position as chief of staff in the Office of the President at Northeastern University, where she will begin next month.
David Ellis, who has previously served as the president of the Boston Museum of Science and as interim director for the Boston Children’s Museum, will serve as the interim director of the HMNH as the museum searches for Werby’s permanent successor.
Werby announced her departure in an e-mail to the museum community yesterday.
“I have accomplished much of what I set out to accomplish,” she said. “Now it is time for new challenges.”
She wrote in a separate e-mail to The Crimson that during her tenure, “the museum has enhanced its visibility both on and beyond the campus, partnering with faculty and students in a wide range of programmatic activities and increasing annual attendance by nearly 30 percent to 180,000 visitors a year.”
She wrote that she is most proud of the museum’s achievements in engaging more undergraduates, “as general visitors, as participants in our programs, and in their classes.”
“The museum has increasing relevance as a resource for teaching,” she wrote.
Northeastern extended its offer to Werby in early January, and Werby said she has worked with the staff at the museum over the past month to develop a transition plan.
“We did not want to make a broad announcement until there was a plan for an orderly transition,” Werby said, adding that plans are already in place for future exhibitions and programs.
“I would not have left unless I believed [the museum] was in a terrific place,” Werby said.
She said that she has been working with Ellis for the past two weeks to introduce him to the staff and museum plans.
The advisory board of the museum selected Ellis as the interim director of the HMNH, Werby said, adding that it was a decision “that I’m really happy about.”
“The museum has a wonderful staff who do their jobs extraordinarily well,” she said.

About 7,600 Harvard ID cards stopped working around 4:30 a.m. yesterday morning, according to an e-mail from Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
As a result of the glitch, which Neal said was caused by “a server configuration change earlier that evening,” thousands of Harvard affiliates were unable to access residential dorms and other such Harvard buildings that require swipe access.
According to Cheryl L. Ruane, production manager of Harvard University ID services, Crimson Cash was still accessible while the system was down.
Staff responded to the problem as soon as they were aware of it and began restoring the corrupted data, Neal wrote.
“No data was lost and the integrity of the system was not compromised,” Neal said.
Neal said that it took several hours to restore the system and that the system was not fully operational until yesterday afternoon. Several impacted students reported that their cards worked again by noon.
Generally, students reported that the swipe system failure had minimal impact on their daily routine.
Mario E. Leon, building manager of Pforzheimer House, unlocked several of the House’s exterior doors so that students could enter without an ID.
“I just wanted to make sure all students could get in,” Leon said.
Leon, who received an e-mail from the administration yesterday morning pertaining to the problem with the server, said most of the affected IDs belonged to Harvard staff and people with special IDs, rather than undergraduates.
He also said that the glitch only affected the FAS.
Neal said that the IT staff, which investigated the problem, was not aware of similar system failures in the past.
John Koullias ’11 said that he realized his ID no longer worked yesterday morning after being denied entry to multiple doors of Adams House.
Assuming that only his card was faulty, Koullias tried to go to the HUID office, located in the Holyoke Center.
“I was going to go upstairs to the ID services,” he said. “but when I went to swipe my card it also turned red, so I couldn’t get upstairs.”
Eventually, Koullias spoke with a security guard and learned that it was a system-wide problem.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences revised the Latin honors system for graduating seniors by Faculty vote at a meeting Tuesday.
The proposal, first introduced by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris in the Feb. 1 Faculty meeting, lowers the threshold for summa cum laude candidates.
Instead of a subjective rate that oscillates between four and five percent, the revision stipulates that a flat five percent of the student body can become summa cum laude candidates, beginning with the Class of 2012.
Furthermore, the revision removes a requirement that students must receive an A-level grade in at least two classes in each of the humanities, social sciences, and sciences divisions to receive the highest Latin honor.
Harris said that this revision reflected an effort to clarify the “opaque” language regarding the honors criteria in the student handbooks.
For instance, according to the online student handbook, FAS has “recommended” between four and five percent of the May degree candidates with the highest academic achievements be considered for summa cum laude.
By fixing the percentage at five percent, FAS avoids potential subjective judgment when evaluating a student’s candidacy for summa cum laude.
The proposal stirred a larger debate on the value of the honors system and the emphasis on grades among faculty members when it was first presented at the Faculty meeting.
“In my experience high grades at Harvard don’t predict future success very well, (except success at being a professor, where academic achievement does continue, I think),” Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson after the meeting on February 1.
“I have been teaching at Harvard for 37 years now, and the two students I’ve taught who have had the biggest impact on the world didn’t even earn their degrees, much less with honors,” Lewis added in the e-mail.
The disconnect between grades and real-world achievements is one reason why Lewis said he hoped that the emphasis on the honors system should be “ratcheted down.”

Millions of Americans could temporarily be left without insurance coverage under the recent health care reform legislation, according to a study co-authored by Benjamin D. Sommers, an assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Singed into law by President Obama last March, the health care reform legislation seeks to provide affordable coverage for all Americans.
But according to Sommers, under the new law, monthly fluctuations in income will cause low-income families to move back and forth between Medicaid and subsidized insurance coverage obtained through federally-mandated state exchanges. Some people may have to wait several weeks after their Medicaid coverage ends for their exchange insurance to take effect or vice versa, Sommers said.
According to the report, more than 35 percent of all adults with family incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level will experience a shift in eligibility from Medicaid to an insurance exchange. Within 50 years, 28 million people will have undergone the same shift.
“Some of the people who would benefit the most from health care reform are people who stand to gain an enormous amount but are going to have challenges remaining continuously insured and with continuity of care,” said co-author Sara Rosenbaum, a law professor at George Washington University.
The researchers began investigating the topic for their study last summer by obtaining income and insurance status data from Survey of Income and Program Participation, a national survey administered every four months by the Census Bureau.
From this, Sommers said they determined who would initially qualify for Medicaid or state exchanges under health care reform and then tracked every time low-income families crossed the threshold between Medicaid and exchange eligibility each month.
Sommers said the “bouncing around” of incomes on a monthly basis was more common than he initially thought.
“It does look like this is really going to be an issue states are going to have to address if they want to minimize disruptions,” Sommers said.
Though coverage disruption is not a new issue—and the act does provide some safeguards for families experiencing a change in income—the report offers several suggestions to facilitate the transition between insurance policies. Policy options include reducing the likelihood of frequent eligibility changes, providing support services for the shift, and aligning coverage and benefits.
The new health care law is the largest expansion of health coverage for lower-income people since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, according to the report.
“This will still be a major improvement for their health care access compared to now, since millions of these adults currently have no insurance at all,” Sommers said. “But our study points out that state and federal policy makers will need to take steps to reduce the frequency of coverage changes for these families and to protect the continuity of their health care.”

A team of researchers at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Princeton University, and Brandeis University recently demonstrated the ability of clay to assemble itself into semi-permeable membranes, the first time that such membranes—which are an important building block in cells—have been formed out of an inorganic material.
According to lead author Anand B. Subramaniam, a graduate student at SEAS, researchers have been wondering for years how the first cells were able to separate their internal compartments. Initially, he said, researchers believed that life may have originated from a “primordial soup” of organic molecules.
However, Subramaniam continued, this theory does not provide an adequate explanation because reactions can only occur at a reasonable pace if the molecules are in high concentrations. One way to create these pockets of highly concentrated organic material necessary for life is to create semi-permeable containers that will preferentially allow organic material to enter the compartment—in other words, to create “protocells.”
Subramaniam and his fellow researchers found that such cell-like “clay-armored bubbles” form naturally when particles of a particular clay accumulate on the surface of air bubbles under water.
When these bubbles are exposed to organic liquids, the air bubbles dissipate. The result is a strong, spherical shell of clay physically separating molecules on the inside from those on the outside. The researchers also demonstrated that microscopic holes in the clay shell form a semi-permeable membrane allowing certain chemicals to enter the cells while preventing others from leaving.
Subramaniam tested the semipermeability a number of different ways. In one test, he used a fatty acid that assembles into vesicles (bubble-like structures) when in a highly basic environment.
“We put this fatty acid in the solution and saw that fatty acid liposomes [vesicles] were formed inside the cell. We figured that the [fats] could go through the membrane, but then when they formed liposomes, they were too big to exit again,” Subramaniam explained.
Subramaniam said he is particularly excited about this work because the clay material used, montmorillonite, is known to have catalytic properties—aiding in the biologically important tasks of cell membrane formation and RNA production. He and his fellow researchers hope to explore this property of the clay in conjunction with its ability to form cell-like structures. The researchers also hope to find examples of such clay structures in today’s natural environment.
“The big question is whether you can find these sorts of structures in the natural world,” says Subramaniam.

Two new studies by Harvard stem cell labs have shown that human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are the equivalent of human embryonic stem cells for the purpose of reconstructing certain key types of cells, including neurons.
IPS cells are derived by reprogramming adult cells, and are distinct from embryonic stem cells, which are derived from a fertilized human embryo.
Kevin Eggan, associate professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, and his team derived a set of 16 new iPSC lines and tested these cell lines for “pluripotency.” This term refers to the ability of a particular stem cell to differentiate into any cell type in the body.
According to the study, published in “Nature Biotechnology” earlier this month, all 16 of the iPSC lines eventually passed a test for pluripotency and developed into functional motor neurons similar in efficiency to those produced by embryonic cells.
A cutting-edge test for pluripotency developed by the lab of Assistant Professor of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Alexander Meissner corroborated Eggan’s results, showing that iPSC lines are comparable in functionality to embryonic stem cell lines.
Using this new assay, Meissner’s group tested and compared the pluripotencies of 12 of the new iPSC lines generated by Eggan’s lab against 20 embryonic stem cell lines.
The researchers established a baseline with which biologists can compare new cell lines, allowing them to analyze differences in variation and to predict the differentiation efficiency of each line. The study was published early this month in the journal “Cell.”
Meissner said that the study showed considerable internal variation within both the iPSC and human embryonic stem cell lines, but found no systematic difference between the two types of cells.
“The assay lets us now conclude that there is no fundamental problem with iPS cells, and we can differentiate which cell lines [within both types] are good and which are bad,” Meissner said.
He added that the new assay method, which is patent-pending, allows for a faster, more efficient way to test new cell lines.
The current accepted test for pluripotency in new human cell lines is known as a “teratoma assay,” which is relatively slow, inaccurate, and cost-intensive, according to Meissner.
A teratoma assay can take up to two months and can only test one cell line at a time. Under the new assay method, which takes about two weeks, researchers can test many cell lines at once, Meissner said.

While some students spend their summers researching alone in dimly lit and poorly ventilated labs, Grace K. Charles ’11 spent the summer before her senior year conducting research in the company of elephants and hyenas underneath the bright Kenyan sun.
“It was like one huge funny adventure,” said Charles, adding that she would sometimes exit her home to see wild animals in front of door.
Charles, an organismic and evolutionary biology concentrator, is now working on her senior thesis using the data she collected over last summer.
“Just getting to do your own research is really an experience unto itself,” Charles said. “It’s something you can’t really get if you’re just taking classes.”
Charles can trace her interest in science back to the school yard, where she remembers writing in her fifth grade yearbook, “I’m going to be a scientist someday,” she says. “It’s been a lifelong dream.”
In high school, Charles worked in an engineering lab. The summer after her freshman year, she studied abroad at Oxford, where, she said, her interest in animal behavior sparked. Pursuing her newfound passion, Charles spent her sophomore summer in Puerto Rico, studying the way species adapt to their environments.
But her path to the plains of Kenya was unexpected.
During her second year in college, Charles began research work with Jonathan B. Losos ’84, a professor of organismic and evolutionary biology. The following year, researching the evolutionary purpose of Anole lizards’ tail crests in the same lab, ecologist and Harvard Junior Fellow Robert M. Pringle arrived from Kenya to give a presentation to Charles’ lab group.
She says she found Pringle’s research studying the effects of climate change on ecosystems “really cool.”
She then made the decision to spend the summer before senior year with Pringle in Kenya, doing her own thesis research on how herbivores, as well as different climatic factors, affect the ecosystem.
It was in Africa where Charles says she realized that she was more interested in the ecosystem than the animals within it. The summer in Kenya was also Charles’ first time controlling her own experiment.
“I actually got to run and make all the decisions,” Charles said. “So it was a great learning experience. I didn’t come in being an expert or anything but I definitely know a lot more now.”
Charles is still working on her thesis, currently analyzing satellite images of the regions in which she conducted research. Before applying to graduate school, Charles said she plans to return to Africa to manage her project.
“She’s the sort of undergraduate student everyone wants to have,” Losos said. “She’s hardworking, enthusiastic, very creative, intelligent, and—just as importantly—she gets the job done.”

A recent study by Harvard-affiliated researchers revealed that kudzu—an herb found to reduce alcohol consumption—does not work by increasing the intoxicating effects of alcohol so that individuals get drunk faster.
While the mechanism by which the plant extract lowers alcohol intake is still unclear, eliminating this particular explanation was crucial before the researchers could give drug companies the green light to produce new kudzu pills, which is expected to be marketed in the coming months.
“Essentially we know a little bit more about how kudzu doesn’t work at the moment,” said study co-author David M. Penetar, assistant professor of psychology in Harvard Medical School’s Psychiatry Department and a research psychologist at McLean Hospital. McLean Hospital is an affiliate of Harvard Medical School.
The kudzu vine, imported from Japan in 1876, has been written about in Chinese medical literature for centuries for its general health benefits. But recently, it has been tested for its ability to reduce alcohol cravings.
In 2005, researchers including Penetar and Director of McLean Hospital’s Neuroimaging Center Scott E. Lukas performed a study in which volunteers were given either kudzu or placebo pills for a week and then encouraged to consume as much beer as they desired in a relaxed setting—a laboratory complete with a sofa, television, and beer-stocked fridge. Compared to weeks in which the participants took no pill or a placebo, individuals with kudzu in their system consumed almost half as much alcohol—and showed no side effects or awareness of the drug.
But before Penetar and Lukas­—a Professor of Psychiatry at HMS—could endorse kudzu, they needed to be sure that it did not simply make individuals experience the same level of intoxication with half as much alcohol. If that were the case, taking the drug would help people get drunk faster rather than helping them drink less.
In this recent study, the researchers gave twelve participants different schedules of placebo or kudzu pills, and then observed the effects of drinking a set amount of vodka. They tested steadiness of gait, body sway, how well participants could stand upright, and how drunk they said they felt, among other factors. The researchers found that these types of responses were not intensified if participants had taken kudzu, suggesting that the drug does not work by increasing the intensity or duration of alcohol’s effects.
“You want to make sure that your medication is not as bad or worse than the drug you’re trying to treat,” Lukas said.
“I think that’s what’s kind of unique about this strategy of looking for alternative and complementary medicine,” he added. “The fundamental premise is that these are not very strong medicines with powerful side effects.”
The researchers next plan to use Magnetic Resonance Imaging to examine the effects of kudzu on how quickly alcohol gets into the brain.
They are also interested in the possibility of developing a dosage of kudzu  that individuals could take once, before a night of drinking, rather than a set of pills which must be taken regularly.
Howard J. Shaffer, associate professor of psychiatry at HMS and Director of the Cambridge Health Alliance’s Division on Addictions, said that kudzu could be one among many effective treatments.
“I think it’s very important to look at a whole portfolio of resources—drugs and behavior, therapeutic approaches, cognitive treatments,” he said. “What we’re finding is that a cocktail of treatment approaches works better than any single treatment strategy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite impressive growth in the number of engineering concentrators—and a noted rise in Harvard’s national reputation for engineering—many of Harvard’s young engineers do not seem to be satisfied.
According to senior surveys completed by the class of 2010 last May, engineering sciences ranks the lowest in terms of student satisfaction. Thirtyeight seniors concentrating in engineering sciences gave the concentration an average rating of 3.45, well below the College mean of 4.18 and 4.21 for natural sciences concentrations.
“It’s certainly not good to be at the bottom of the list, but we’re at least relieved that students aren’t giving us 1s and 2s,” says Robert D. Howe, associate dean for academic programs at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Howe, along with many current ES concentrators, says he thinks dissatisfaction stems from inadequate advising.
“We have had some growing pains. As enrollment has gone up, we haven’t kept up with advising as we should,” he says.
And while many concentrators say they are largely happy with their experience, some say they are not necessarily surprised by last spring’s results.
SUBPAR ADVISING
Robert D. Longcor ’12, an ES concentrator, says he still does not have an official concentration adviser. The junior says he was always interested in engineering, but after considerable dissatisfaction with the Bachelor of Science engineering degree, he switched to the less demanding Bachelor of Arts track and added a secondary in Economics.
“The whole [advising] system is understaffed, not run really well,” he says.
Several sophomore ES concentrators say they have yet to be assigned individual concentration advisers, despite having submitted their official plan of study forms in November.
Without a “well-defined” support system from the administrative staff, many concentrators instead turn to upperclassmen as mentors, according to ES concentrator Julie Xie ’12.
Longcor attributes some of the department’s weaknesses to the youth of SEAS, which was established in 2007.
“Students are comparing this to other concentrations that have been here for hundreds of years,” he says.
SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie Dahleh says that bolstering the advising system is a crucial step to improving the concentration.
“What we have recognized is that we need to have more folks involved,” she says, adding that the department is looking to model its program on the life sciences and invest in assistant directors for undergraduate studies.
As lecturers and mentors, the assistant directors will have “contact with pre-concentrators early,” and may relieve over-burdened advisers, Dahleh says.  Although the advising system lacks the kind of structure sought by some ES concentrators, others, like Caroline T. Quazzo ’12, say the small size of the concentration facilitates contact between professors and students.
“I actually think the advising [is] quite good,” she says.
HIGH DEMANDS
Among concentrations at the College, ES is also uniquely demanding. Bachelor of Science candidates must complete 20 half-courses, the highest number of requirements at the College.
Concentrators pursuing a Bachelor of Arts, meanwhile, are required to enroll in 14 to 16 half-courses.
The set of courses—which encompasses classes in mathematics and applied science—ensures that concentrators achieve a deep understanding in their field. But juggling the full course load in addition to laboratory commitments, Gen Ed requirements, and extracurriculars can at times be daunting.
“I think students aren’t very happy with [ES] because it’s a huge workload and a lot of problem sets,” says Carl Daher ’13, an ES concentrator.
Quazzo says that of her 16 required courses, 10 were introductory engineering requirements.
“It’s definitely grown on me—[it was] daunting at the beginning,” she says.
Scheduling so many classes also poses logistical problems, according to Howe. Many courses are held in the afternoon and may interfere with extracurriculars and athletic commitments.
“Optimizing these schedules is difficult,” he says, but the department is trying to move classes around. Given the complex nature of the concentration, efforts are also in place to make requirements easier to understand.
Not all concentrators say they are bothered by the demands. ES Concentrator Sarah E. Campbell ’12 says she has had semesters with over 23 hours of class each week, but she appreciates the rigor. “The benefit of having a lot of class time is that you completely immerse yourself in the material,” she says.  And concentrators are not shy to share the heavy-lifting; challenging problem sets have a way of bringing students together, according to Xie.
In fact, many say the concentration as a whole is very tight-knit.
“It’s so small that I actually know every professor,” says William C. Burke ’13, a mechanical engineering concentrator.
POSITIVE CHANGES
For William H. Marks ’12, vice president of the Harvard College Engineering Society (HCES), improvements to the ES experience are already underway.
“One thing that SEAS has done well is that it [has] begun to listen more to student wishes,” says Marks, adding that the administration has been increasingly receptive to student suggestions.
Dahleh affirms these efforts.
“We’ve partnered pretty heavily with the Harvard College Engineering Society just to get more feedback about student experience,” she says, adding that the department is also working with the Office of Career Services to help students find internships and jobs.
The implementation of lab components and the opening of a new microfluidics teaching facility are two additional developments aimed at fostering a “hands-on, industry sponsored” approach to student learning, says Dahleh.
Burke is working with Barry A. Griffin ’71, a visiting lecturer on design curriculum development, to build a turbine to power underwater sensory equipment. “It’s fantastic, because I’m already able to help the world,” Burke says.
Griffin has been actively developing hands-on projects at the undergraduate level, and in courses like ES 20: “How to Create Things and Have Them Matter” student have the opportunity to tackle real-world design challenges. Furthermore, student initiative also fuels innovative projects in engineering.
Xie works with HCES to find and advertise design projects for students. “Having an environment outside of class where you can express your creativity, design something crazy, is a very different experience than what the classes offer. That has added a different dimension to the concentration,” she says.
“I think it’s a generational thing,” adds Marks. “The seniors who ranked [ES] so low started out doing engineering at a very different time and I think that as the juniors, sophomores, and freshmen progress through the ranks, you will see the numbers rise very rapidly.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: FEB. 21, 2011.
The Feb. 18 article "Engineering School Sees Low Satisfaction Ratings" incorrectly identified the concentration's satisfaction numbers. In 2010, the concentration scored an average rating of 3.45. In 2002, its score was 3.11.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A comeback starts as a seed. It’s invisible. No one in the stands can see it. Most of them never germinate. Out-of-town scoreboards are littered with these unrealized comebacks: 10-point deficits that become 10-point losses.
But once in a while, unbeknownst to everyone watching, something like magic happens. It can start with a play, with a look, with a word. It can start with a coach telling his kids, “This is going to be part of our story.” He looks them in the eye and says, “We’ll look back and say this is one of the moments that helped us win the Ivy League.”
The seed is planted. The 24-point deficit begins to shrink. Three straight layups. A pair of free throws. It peeks through the soil, and, for the first time, there’s a sign of life. A cautious hope ripples through the stands.
A dunk. A three-pointer. Another layup. No longer a bud, the comeback is taking shape. It’s inching upward, willing itself out of the earth, when suddenly it takes off. Two three-pointers, a layup, two more threes. It’s a four-point game. The comeback is almost complete. It’s grown out of nothing in front of our very eyes. But worse than it never being would be to lose it now.
A dunk—two-point game. A three-pointer—the lead! Yet the comeback isn’t finished. It continues to grow. A two-point lead becomes five-points, seven-, 10-, 11-. It’s roots dig deep and grip the earth like a fist. This comeback sticks. Harvard 85, Brown 78. The fourth-largest second-half comeback in NCAA history.
In the aftermath, we can finally see what the comeback was made out of. It started with faith: a coach believing in his kids in their lowest moment. It took character: the Crimson responding to its worst half of the season with its best. It needed talent: 18 second-half points from sophomore guard Christian Webster, 19 total points from sophomore forward Kyle Casey, 10 points and five assists from sophomore Brandyn Curry (carrying the point guard duties by himself), and a dominant 22-point, 14-rebound performance by junior co-captain Keith Wright.
And of course, like all comebacks, it had a little bit of magic, of which Lavietes had plenty on an unforgettable Saturday night.
HARVARD (18-4, 7-1 Ivy) at CORNELL (6-16, 2-6 Ivy)
Harvard is back in Ithaca tonight where it has lost three straight, including an embarrassing 86-50 defeat last season and a 96-75 trouncing the year before. The tables have turned this time around as the Crimson is the title contender. Harvard is the clear favorite, following its 21-point victory over the Big Red three weeks ago.
Aside from the game, Cornell has something else at stake this weekend. This will be my third visit to upstate New York, and on the previous two trips I haven’t been able to find a good meal, settling for warm pizza with congealed cheese and questionable subs each time. A big part of every road trip is sampling the local cuisine, and unless Ithaca steps up its culinary repertoire, I’m declaring its food the worst in the league.
Pick: Harvard 78, Cornell 73
PENN (9-12, 3-4 Ivy) at BROWN (9-13, 2-6 Ivy)
Last Friday, as Penn was trailing by 15 points to the Big Red in the first half, I told Crimson Sports Chair Dennis Zheng that the Quakers would come back, force overtime, and lose for the third game in a row. Guess what happened? Penn forced overtime, and Cornell won 82-71.
The only book I ever read growing up was “An Almost Perfect Game” by Stephen Manes. It’s about a kid who controls a baseball game by filling out his scorecard ahead of time. I obviously have similar powers. So when I say Penn’s winning this game by two, my word is as good as Nostradamus’.
Pick: Penn 71, Brown 69
DARTMOUTH (5-17, 1-7 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (13-9, 4-4 Ivy)
The losses are starting to pile up for Dartmouth; it’s dropped five in a row and 10 of its last 11. During its current losing streak, the margin of defeat has not dipped below nine points. The Big Green hasn’t come close to figuring it out lately, and there’s no reason to think its luck changes tonight.
Pick: Columbia 73, Dartmouth 63
PRINCETON (19-4, 7-0 Ivy) at YALE (12-10, 5-3 Ivy)
Yale took the Crimson down to the wire last Friday, so the Bulldogs can clearly compete with the best, which Princeton is as of now. But the Tigers, despite their undefeated conference record, are not immune to an upset. Four of Princeton’s seven victories have been by four points or less, and you can only win like that for so long before it catches up to you.
The Bulldogs are the second toughest matchup left on the Tigers’ schedule, so a win would be a huge boon to Princeton’s title chances. Perhaps it’s the optimist in me, but I think Yale defends its home court, avenges the four-point loss in January, and hands Princeton its first league defeat.
Pick: Yale 74, Princeton 73
DARTMOUTH at CORNELL
Round two of the most irrelevant matchup in the league. Dartmouth got the best of the Big Red last time, but Cornell has a little momentum on its side now, having won two of its last three and almost beating Princeton last Saturday.
The Big Red is the much better team, and it’s actually beginning to shape up into a winner. I see the home team with an easy victory.
Pick: Cornell 70, Dartmouth 59
PENN at YALE
Penn is freefalling right now. The Quakers have lost four straight, three of them in overtime. It’s actually painful to watch because I like this Penn team a lot. Zack Rosen, Jack Eggleston, and Tyler Bernardini can match up with the top three players on any team (though their skill sets overlap a little—they don’t complement one another as well as some of their Big Three counterparts). Miles Cartwright is one of the most promising freshmen in the Ivies. Jerome Allen is the best-dressed coach in the league. There’s a lot to like, and yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts.
I have to see a reason to believe in a Quaker turnaround before I pick them. Yale is the clear No. 3 in the Ivies right now, and it should defend the Amphitheater.
Pick: Yale 67, Penn 63
PRINCETON at BROWN
I felt a little bad for Brown on Saturday. It was like a night at the MAC where one minute you’re crushing it on the side court against that team with four players—including a small girl and a flat-footed Jeremy-Lin-wannabe, who fires three-pointers against the backboard and yells, “Kobe”—and the next minute you’re getting smoked on the center court with all those seniors who were cut from varsity. You, like the Bears, are probably not as bad as the second game would indicate, but you’re nowhere near as good as the first game either.
If the Bears are truly in that middle ground, then I don’t see them beating Princeton. The Tigers cruise.
Pick: Princeton 72, Brown 64
HARVARD at COLUMBIA
I’m a huge fan of Columbia’s gym. Levien is underground and boxy, so the atmosphere is very contained and intimate. The fans are actually clever and funny; they’re probably my favorite student section in the league. On top of all that, it all takes place in the city, alums come out to watch the game, and there’s a dope pizza place nearby—it makes for a fun night. It will be even better if the Crimson escape with a win, which I think it will.
Pick: Harvard 77, Columbia 71
RECORD LAST WEEK: 7-1 (To date: 19-6)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a loss in the Beanpot finals to Boston College, the Harvard women’s hockey team looks to finish off the regular season on a high note before the upcoming playoffs.
The Crimson faces No. 2 Cornell (25-1-1, 19-0-1 ECAC) and Colgate (11-17-3, 8-10-2 ECAC) this weekend at Bright Hockey Center.
Harvard (14-9-4, 13-4-3 ECAC) currently holds the No. 2 seed in the conference and needs to tie or win one of their remaining games in order to hold onto its spot and secure home ice until the ECAC championship game.
“We are looking to take this one game at a time, first with Colgate today—we are going in and looking to play our best,” sophomore forward Jillian Dempsey said. “Our goal is for two wins this weekend and to finish our regular season on a high note ... When we play our best and we move the puck well and play well as a team, it is difficult to beat us.”
Highlighting the importance of clinching home ice for the playoffs is the team’s impressive home record of 7-2-1.
“Home ice would be amazing just because it takes away from the difficulties of traveling somewhere else,” Dempsey said. “We also have our home crowd and home ice. We go through our whole routine: it gives us a lot of confidence and [brings] more excitement by playing in our house.”
Before the Beanpot finals, the Crimson’s past three games had gone into overtime. In the stretch, the team has won in a shootout over Northeastern in the first round of the Boston collegiate tournament, tied Clarkson, and earned a 3-2 victory on a last-second goal from Dempsey in overtime.
Harvard’s upcoming games against Colgate and Cornell feature two opponents with greatly varying degrees of success—the Raiders are the ECAC’s best, and the Big Red is ninth in the conference.
Colgate is trying to hold onto one of the final playoffs seeds for the upcoming ECAC playoffs.
In their previous meeting, the Crimson defeated the Raiders, 3-1, and will look to continue its previous success against the team.
Colgate is led by sophomore forward Britney Phillips and junior goalie Kimberly Sass. Phillips, the Raiders’ leading scorer has 15 goals and 18 assists in 31 games this year. Sass comes into the game with a school-record five shutouts, all of which have been at home.
But the regular season finale against Cornell will be Harvard’s real test.
The Big Red comes into the game fresh off a 7-1 victory to clinch the best record among Ivy League teams. Cornell is undefeated in its last 22 games and has not lost on the road yet this season.
The team has relied on the dynamic scoring duo of junior Rebecca Johnston and freshman Brianne Jenner, both of whom have 21 goals and 20 assists.
In their previous meeting on Nov. 5th, the Big Red took down the Crimson, 3-0, in Ithica.
“I think that this is a completely different game; that was the first [away] game of our year, [but] we have learned a bit [since then],” tri-captain Kate Buesser said. “I think it is more important for us to stick to our game plan that we developed over the season by using our speed and our system to outplay them.”
Cornell is clearly the stronger of Harvard’s weekend opponents, but the Crimson must be careful not to overlook Colgate, who is still trying to scratch its way into the playoffs.
“It is the same mentality for Colgate as it is for Cornell,” Buesser said. “[We] just have to respect what [Cornell] has [in that] it is a higher intensity game,” Buesser said.
This weekend’s games will not only decide home ice for the playoffs, but also gives the team the chance to ride some momentum into the playoffs.
“There is a race for the second seed which would give us home playoff advantage until the final, which is a huge factor for us playing into this weekend,” Buesser said. “There is definitely a kind of [hope] of finishing the regular season with the same intensity you have coming into the playoffs.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is no rest for the weary.
A mere six days after losing the Ancient Eight crown to Yale, the Harvard women’s squash team (9-1, 5-1 Ivy) will take the court again later today to compete in the College Squash Association Team Championship Tournament at Princeton.
Just last week, the Crimson seemed well on its way to recapturing the Howe Cup as it dismantled No. 3 Trinity with a resounding 7-2 victory, taking all six matches in the second and third cycles.
But Harvard’s fortune took a serious blow after dropping a heartbreaker against the then-No. 2 Bulldogs last Saturday, 5-4. This weekend the Crimson looks to bounce back and recapture the number one spot.
While there is no questioning the talent, depth and coaching of Harvard, it remains to be seen if the Crimson can move on and refocus after losing its top ranking, its 21-game winning streak, and the Ivy League crown.
But according to three-time All-American and captain Alisha Mashruwala, that should not be a problem.
“The mental mindset is very positive right now,” Mashruwala said. “I think playing a close, competitive match was a learning experience for all of us, and I think we are definitely going to come back stronger this weekend.”
Harvard, slotted in the second spot, will face Ivy foe Cornell—captained by Harvard standout Laura Gemmell’s sister, Jenn—in the first round of the Howe Cup Championship this afternoon. Earlier this season in Ithaca, the Crimson quickly dispatched the Big Red (5-5, 2-4) in decisive fashion with a 9-0 rout. Five of the nine players, including Harvard’s No. 5 Natasha Kingshott and No. 7 Cece Cortes, won their matches in straight sets.
In all likelihood, the Crimson will move on to the second round tomorrow to face either the sixth seed, Stanford (7-5), or, more likely, the dark horse, No. 3 Trinity (13-2, 1-0 NESCAC).
With last week’s loss against Harvard in mind, the Bantams made a statement by punishing Princeton last Sunday, 8-1, to head into the CSA championships. Led by junior captain Pamela Hathway, the second-ranked player in the nation, Trinity will likely attempt to play bracket buster and knock off Harvard.
If the Crimson makes it past the second round, the squad could face a rematch against Yale in the championship.
“The last game was a tough loss for us ... but, I think the loss is really motivating our team,“ said Laura Gemmell, the nation’s number one player.
After prevailing against Harvard during the preseason and eking out another win last Saturday, the Bulldogs (14-0, 5-0) have rolled into the CSA championships with everything going for them. Sporting a flawless record and 10 top-100 players, Yale possesses the firepower to take home the Howe Cup and spoil Harvard’s quest for back-to-back championships.
Logan Greer, Sarah Toomey, and Millie Tomlinson, numbers three, four, and 10 in the nation, respectively, will look to lead the Bulldogs through tournament play.
With weaker opposition in the top half of the bracket, Yale’s road to the championship will take it past No. 8 Dartmouth and either No. 4 Princeton or No. 5 Penn.
Gemmel, Harvard’s ace who has never lost a match in her collegiate career, will look to lead Harvard to the championship—a place the Crimson was projected to reach from the first preseason poll.
Only this time, the Crimson would play the underdog to Yale’s alpha dog.
Gemmell, along with Mashruwala will look to continue her solid play, but other standout players—including national number seven, Junior Nirasha Guruge, and ninth ranked Senior June Tiong—will need to step up to avoid being swept again by Yale’s power players.
The Crimson knows that repeating last year’s championship-winning performance will be no easy feat. But, at the same time, after a regular season marked by both triumph and upset losses, Harvard knows what it will take to silence the naysayers in New Haven and around the Ivy League.
“A lot of the players have been watching the video of their matches this week and seeing what went wrong and what they can change tactically,” Gemmell said. “A clear game plan will make the difference if we do meet [the Bulldogs] in the final.”
During this tournament, the Crimson will look to prove if the third time really is the charm and possibly cement the status of what could be a budding dynasty.
“The most important thing is being able to support your teammates, really pushing them and believing in each other,” Mashruwala said, “Everyone is excited to go out there and show everyone what they have.”

It's dinner time, and you're looking for a healthy meal. You decide to hit up the salad bar and prepare a bowl of edamame. You sit down to eat and notice one of the beans is brown, not green. Upon closer inspection, you realize that what you first thought was a bean is, in fact, a snail.
 
 One Adams House dining hall employee, who wishes to remain anonymous in order to preserve relations with HUHDS, said she's never heard of anything like this before.
 Adams House resident Luke L. Sperduto '11, however, said that this is not an isolated incident.
 "This reminds me of the time when I found several bugs in the sunflower seeds toward the beginning of the year," Sperduto said.
 Despite finding the occasional insect in Adams House dining hall food, Sperduto continues to eat there.
"I definitely look at my food more, though," he said.
Nonetheless, Tanya V. Avilova '13 said there's no cause for alarm. 
"It's concerning to a certain extent," she said, "but I have trust in the dining hall staff."
After hearing of the incident, Martin T. Breslin, HUHDS director for culinary operations, contacted Zoe A.Y. Weinberg '13, the Crimson editor who found the snail in her edamame Tuesday night, and apologized. According to Breslin, HUHDS purchases frozen edamame from an outside food service provider and is presently investigating whether the snail was introduced into HUHDS' edamame by the provider or in a HUHDS kitchen.

Although Boston is only a short T-ride away from the Square, most Harvard students rarely visit our neighbors across the River. While the Square offers an abundance of activities, there is still a whole world—or at least an easily accessible city—out there to explore.
As a result of Harvard's recent expansion of the Outings & Innings program to students, undergraduate and graduate students now have the opportunity to purchase discounted tickets to attractions in the greater Boston area without even leaving the Square.
The office, located at 9 Holyoke St., is open Tuesdays through Fridays and offers tickets and discounts on everything from museum passes to snowboard lessons and movie tickets. Those desiring a little more adventure should check back in early April to get discounted tickets to Six Flags New England.
Visit the Outings & Innings website to check out the rest of the discounts they offer, though be aware that the office is cash only.

Need help with that annotated bibliography for Expos? There's an app for that.
QuickCite, a 99-cent application for iPhone and Android, automates the task of making a bibliography. Users take a picture of a book's barcode using a virtualized barcode scanner. QuickCite then translates the barcode into a properly formatted citation and sends the citation to the user's e-mail.
The application, which has already been featured in PC and Fast Company magazines, was created by a group of seven undergraduates from the University of Waterloo.
The team, known as 7Cubed, challenged themselves to create seven applications over the course of a week. The original version of QuickCite, which took the group only 12 hours to develop, was the first of their projects.
Gareth MacLeod, one of the application's developers, said that he expects that QuickCite will be especially popular among college-level students and other people for which academic writing and bibliographies are a must.
"QuickCite is an amazing app, and it's going to save a lot of people a lot of time in the future," MacLeod said.
