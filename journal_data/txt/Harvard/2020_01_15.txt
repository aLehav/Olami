After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Conversation is flirtation,” which is fitting given that Miranda Popkey’s debut novel “Topics of Conversation” is all about desire, and, of course, flirtation. The novel is also a flirtation with its literary predecessors: It’s been compared to Lydia Davis and Sally Rooney, and the author herself references works from Jenny Zhang’s collection “Sour Heart” to Martin Scorsese’s film “Goodfellas” as inspiration in her “Works (Not) Cited” at the back of the book. “Topics of Conversation” has some big shoes to fill, and while this novel isn’t necessarily going to be the groundbreaking text of the decade, it’s certainly worth the read.
“Composed almost exclusively of conversations between women,” this tiny novel — barely bigger than a hand and clocking in at 205 pages — may seem a bit gimmicky (at least, that was my worry). Yet Popkey avoids falling into the traps that confound many an experimental author. While the book is spread out across two decades and jumps from conversation to conversation, the dialogue is accompanied with the narrator’s thoughts and feelings, her backstory, and her deepest desires. Filling in these details allows Popkey to fill in the gaps between conversations. In a way, it reads like most contemporary literary fiction rather than a transcription of conversations.
What makes this novel distinctive is not the structure but the prose. Anyone who has ever been tasked with transcribing human speech will know that we do not speak with perfect grammar. In fact, human speech doubles back, pauses, and leaves phrases or entire sentences unfinished in ways that are often infuriating for someone trying to put together a coherent written document. Popkey writes the way humans really speak. At first, it’s maddening — why can’t she just write clearly? — but soon it becomes clear that this is not random incoherence but rather an apt reflection of the way we actually talk to one another. While it may bend the rules of grammar, the meaning is clear: “she lifted her hand and waved it, at the side of the stage, waiting for the line so that she can — for the cue.” Popkey’s characters are no more inarticulate than the rest of us.
And no review of this book would be complete without talking about the topics of these conversations: desire. At the heart of it all is desire: what women desire, what men desire, and how we all express or hide it. The novel is full of clear explanations for particular behaviors : “When [women] thought about sex we thought mostly about ways to defend against what we didn’t want instead of ways to pursue what we did. So that now the way I thought to attract a man was to make myself vulnerable to attack.” the truthfulness lays the characters bare in a way that is almost painful. But perhaps these truths are painful because we’d rather not think about them, so deeply ingrained as they are in our society.
Some of the characters, however, are hard to relate to. While their thoughts are understandable — who hasn’t felt desire or an inexplicable sense of self-hatred? — their actions are not. Take, for example, a character whose self-destructive tendencies go so far as to create a fake email account to pretend she is cheating on her fiance, leaving her own account open for him to find. The actions characters take in “Topics of Conversation” are often over-exaggerations of what actual people might do with very real feelings.
Perhaps the biggest word of caution about “Topics of Conversations” is all the comparisons that plague it: When contrasted with other well-known authors, it’s hard for it to stand alone. Popkey will likely not rise to the level of fame of Rooney or Davis, but that’s a high bar. This is a novel that should be read, for its masterful use of speech-like prose and for the meaningful conversations it will inspire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two aspects of Anna Wiener’s memoir, “Uncanny Valley” immediately make themselves apparent: its understated observations and attention to detail. She notes, as if in passing, the smallest of minutiae of the food she sees at a party; she comes to define life in Silicon Valley as everyone optimizing their bodies for longer lives, which could then be spent productively. These observations do double duty: They demonstrate her incredible ability to write nonfiction, and they further highlight why she felt so out of place in Silicon Valley in the first place.
Wiener begins the memoir in New York City, working in a publishing job that does not pay well but which enables her to say that she’s doing a job with some meaning attached to it. She first works for an ebook startup that is essentially constructing a digital library without the feeling of being in one. She then decides to leave for a job at a data analytics startup in San Francisco, despite having qualms about the implications of working there.
Wiener is continuously struck by the self-assuredness of the men she works with and for, and by the contrast between their innate feeling that everything they contribute to society is valuable, and her own feelings of having something to offer without being able to do so. It soon becomes clear to her, and to the reader, that those in Silicon Valley do not value those things.
Once in San Francisco, Wiener struggles to understand the motivations of those around her. Yes, there’s the money, but there’s also an insatiable desire to make everything efficient: apps, meals, experiences, and even people themselves. It is, as she says, “a world freed of decision-making, the unnecessary friction of human behavior, where everything — whittled down to the fastest, simplest, sleekest version of itself — could be optimized, prioritized, monetized, and controlled.”
Partway through the memoir, you might start to wonder why Wiener doesn’t pack her bags and leave. But it isn’t quite that simple. There’s the money at stake (a recurring theme), in addition to perhaps a larger reason. It almost feels as though Wiener is hypnotized by the tech bros around her, with their limitless desire to optimize even that which should not be optimized. There is a pervading sense of coldness to the world she paints for us; it almost feels like the book takes on the qualities of marble or icy steel. There is no humanity to her workplace, and only the barest modicum of it in her personal life. Wiener’s desire to know herself and other people deeply is, ironically, the thing that keeps her in San Francisco: With the keen eye of a writer and humanist, she inspects not only what drives these people, but how they can live with themselves in the soulless world they have constructed.
“Uncanny Valley” also brings up the now-infamous heartbreaking moments of what it’s like to be a woman Silicon Valley. There’s the story of how Wiener’s mother advised her to never put a complaint about sexism in writing, or the short and snappy one-sentence descriptions of women who see job offers rescinded when they negotiate for more pay — who are raped and forced out by the company after they report the incident to human resources, who are let go after getting pregnant.
The memoir’s most ludicrous moment is when Wiener recounts the story of a startup founder who thinks books should be shorter — you know, to make things more efficient. Such a statement would be funny if it weren’t tragic. Leo Tolstoy is turning in his grave.
What, then, do sexist incidents, a passionate yet soulless desire to improve everything under the sun, and the implied proposal that books like “Anna Karenina” are too long to be “efficient” have to do with each other?
Wiener tells us: People are disposable unless they show their loyalty to the abstract concept of optimization. When all of the above are rationalized and viewed as normal, and when an entire “community,” if it indeed can be called that, collectively ignores the harms that data mining and social disconnect have on the self, the result is Silicon Valley.
Indeed, she presents us an alternative over and over again — and it is an alternative that cannot be dismissed. She says, “My desires were generic. I wanted to find my place in the world, and be independent, useful, and good.” She says, “I wanted work to be intellectually engaging, and I wanted to do it alongside smart, curious people. I wanted long-term projects. I wanted it to matter.” And when it comes to her own health data, she says “I wanted to better understand my own desires, what I wanted; to find a purpose. But nonmedical monitoring of heart rate variability, sleep latency, glucose levels, ketones — none of this was self-knowledge. It was just metadata.”
The memoir’s beauty lies in Wiener’s ability to convey her desires in little packets, cleanly interspersed throughout the memoir. Wiener does not hit the reader over the head with her thesis, which is that something has gone awry in Silicon Valley. She even goes so far as to say that “the part of my brain that took some pleasure in coding also thrived on obsessive-compulsive behavior and perfectionism. It wasn’t the part of my brain that I wanted to nurture.”
Wiener wonders what it would be like to live in a world that values intellectual discourse and emotional complexity, a world in which people’s holistic depths are desired, encouraged, and developed. The entire book is an elegant argument for the urgent need to do so.
But there’s more to it than that: She asks what is really so bad about not wanting to “hack” everything, to not optimize, to not quantify everything. What’s wrong, she asks, with wanting something simple? That something simple is, of course, being seen as a fully-actualized human being, and seeing others in the same way too. It’s a refusal to reduce a person to numbers, goals, and metrics.
To do so, however, would require eliminating the Valley’s money- and efficiency-based “value” system, a system upon which this world thrives. Wiener’s deeply-felt, expertly-expressed discomfort with this world exposes the way in which it stifles and dismisses truly fulfilling human connection — even as it repackages that destruction as meaningful. The deception is perhaps the biggest con of our generation.

Director and actor Elizabeth Banks will be the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2020 Woman of the Year, the organization announced Tuesday.
Banks is known for her roles in “The Hunger Games” franchise, “Love and Mercy,” “The Lego Movie,” and the “Pitch Perfect” film series. She also boasts three Emmy nominations for her recurring television roles in “30 Rock” and “Modern Family.” Banks made her directorial film debut with “Pitch Perfect 2” in 2015 and produced, wrote, directed, and appeared in “Charlie’s Angels” last year.
The Hasty Pudding’s producers wrote in a press release that the organization hopes to honor Banks’s groundbreaking work in Hollywood as a female director, producer and writer.
“Elizabeth is a role model to all of the young women in the theatricals, especially in a year with a female writer, female producers, and a majority female cast — we all cannot wait to celebrate and meet her!” co-producer Natalie F. Needle ’21 wrote.
The Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year festivities will begin on Jan. 31 at 3 p.m. with a parade led by Banks through Harvard Square. At 4 p.m., members of the organization will award Banks the ceremonial Pudding Pot in Farkas Hall following a celebratory roast.
Afterward, the Hasty Pudding will preview “Mean Ghouls,” the group’s second-ever show featuring a cast with both men and women in its over 200-year-long history.
Since 1951, the Hasty Pudding — the oldest theatrical organization in the U.S. — has presented its Woman of the Year award annually to performers whose careers members deem “lasting and impressive.”
Banks will join the ranks of acclaimed entertainers including Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, Kerry Washington, and most recently Bryce Dallas Howard, the 69th Woman of the Year.
The second season of Banks’s series “Shrill” — starring Saturday Night Live cast member and comedian Aidy Bryant — will premiere on Hulu this month.
The Pudding has yet to announce its 2020 Man of the Year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 faculty members signed a Dec. 11 letter to Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay that prompted Gay to initiate a review of the FAS tenure promotion system.
The 107 signatories — which included faculty from both FAS and the Divinity School — called for a “comprehensive review” of the FAS tenure procedures with the principles of diversity, inclusion, and belonging in mind. In her Dec. 17 reply, Gay agreed, writing that she plans to convene a faculty advisory committee to assist with the effort during the 2020-2021 academic year.
“Nearly fifteen years after the creation of Harvard’s tenure track system in 2005 — and in the wake of several devastating and unexpected tenure denials in the past two years — we, the undersigned faculty, call for a comprehensive review of the tenure procedures in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, with an eye toward better aligning them with the University’s stated commitments to diversity, inclusion, and belonging,” the faculty members’ letter reads.
The faculty wrote that though the University has improved significantly since it instituted a tenure promotion system, the tenure track is “harrowing” for those on it.
“[J]unior faculty can do everything right … and still be denied tenure,” the letter reads, citing the recent tenure denials of Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña — whose scholarship engages with race and ethnicity — and Germanic Languages and Literature associate professor Racha Kirakosian. García Peña’s tenure denial in particular sparked protests at the end of the fall semester, including one that disrupted a faculty meeting.
The faculty wrote that the University does not provide justification for its tenure decisions to candidates and demanded greater transparency about the rationale behind tenure decisions to both candidates and their home departments. They added that learning why a colleague was denied tenure can help senior faculty better mentor tenure-track faculty in the future.
“The final stage, often yet not always featuring an ad-hoc committee whose composition is secret and chosen at the Provost’s discretion, is a black box. From that black box emerges a yes or a no. And nothing else,” the letter reads.
English department chair Nicholas J. Watson — who signed the letter — wrote in an email that he signed because he was “shocked as well as surprised” by some recent tenure decisions at the University.
“Whatever you think of our tenure system, it should not produce surprises for those involved in the process, who have access to all the materials,” Watson wrote.
Watson wrote that when professors are unable to anticipate the outcome of their tenure decision, they are more likely to leave Harvard for other universities.
“Surprises lead to a failure of trust in the process, and that is inherently damaging,” Watson wrote. “At a moment when FAS is rightly emphasizing diversity, inclusion, and belonging, it is especially damaging.”
East Asian Languages and Civilizations chair David L. Howell said that his colleagues’ surprise regarding recent tenure decisions may underscore the need to improve “lines of communication” throughout the tenure process.
Howell — who taught at Princeton University for 17 years, including five where he served as a department chair — said that at Princeton, if the committee on appointments spotted any issues with the tenure case, the department chair would be invited to speak to the committee and the President.
“The final decision is still the President’s, but at least in that case, in the one case where I was called in to the committee, if the answer had been no, at least I would have had a pretty good idea why it was no,” Howell said. “Whereas I think if the same case had been at Harvard, and it'd been a no, I might not have had any idea.”
Howell said he understands the need to maintain confidentiality to allow outside experts to be frank in their assessments of a case, but added that he believes feedback is important nonetheless.
“If it’s a no, you know, it’s really gnawing, what was it that sank the case,” he said.
In addition to examining the procedures for final-decision making, Howell said he hopes the review will evaluate the requirement that 12 to 15 outside experts send letters in support of an applicant for tenure. He said the review should examine whether a “one size fits all” approach is appropriate for small or emerging fields, which may not include a sizable pool of people who can speak with authority on a tenure case.
Classics Department Chair Kathleen M. Coleman said she signed the letter because tenure procedures have remained largely stagnant in recent years.
“It’s a very good idea for institutions to periodically revisit their procedures and see whether it's time, you know, for any alteration, or whether the procedures are working well,” Coleman said. “It’s now many years since we instituted the formal tenure track procedure.”
Coleman and Howell both said the review should also examine another unusual aspect of Harvard’s tenure procedures: Associate professorships — which the University typically grants in the fourth year — do not come with tenure, meaning a professor cannot earn tenure until their seventh year.
“Tenure comes only with full professor — that's crucial thing, that's where Harvard is different from most other places,” Coleman said.
By the time the faculty members sent their letter to Gay, hundreds of students and ethnic studies scholars within and outside Harvard had signed onto other letters condemning the University’s decision to deny tenure to García Peña.
The University’s decision prompted a surge in activism lobbying for the development of an ethnic studies program, including a sit-in at University Hall and the December faculty meeting protest. Harvard affiliates have pushed for an ethnic studies program for nearly five decades.
In the wake of the protests, Gay declared an “institutional commitment” to ethnic studies and has said she is “hopeful” faculty spearhead developing a formal program in the field.
