Best Picture: “Her”
"Her" was the best movie of 2013, and high-waisted pants aside, it was also the most relevant. The adorably quirky tale of a lost soul and his operating system imagines a fully realized future for our digitized world, finding a slightly more cuddly side of Joaquin Phoenix in the process. But unlike so many near-future flicks, "Her" isn't a sermon. It's a story of life, love, and connection that bursts out of the sci-fi genre and rips at your heart. In a year full of important films, "Her" deserves the gold because it's just as timeless as it is timely. —Tree A. Palmedo
 
 
Best Actor in a Leading Role: Leonardo DiCaprio (“The Wolf of Wall Street”)
On paper, Jordan Belfort is a boring person. Though his debaucherous antics are certainly juicy, they’re also somewhat predictable; nearly everything he does can be explained by his hedonism. It is very easy to lose interest in a character that always does the wrong thing, and yet “Wolf” is electrifying. The reason? Leonardo DiCaprio, who takes every ounce of star power and channels it into a performance that simply reeks of charisma. His great coup is not so much making a monster likeable as it is making a deeply shallow man compelling. That simple task—finding the interest in the monotonous or mundane—is the definition of good acting. This year, it also stands as the best acting. —Petey E. Menz
 
Best Actress in a Leading Role: Cate Blanchett ("Blue Jasmine")
 
The high-society protagonist of "Blue Jasmine" is her own worst enemy, and the character’s internal struggles are captured perfectly by Cate Blanchett in the year’s best female performance. The riches-to-rags tale finds Jasmine trying to work a receptionist’s desk while deeply self-conscious, to lie her way to marrying a State Department official, to veneer her unraveling psyche in New York cool—it requires every bit of intensity and nuance Blanchett brings. It’s a stressful performance, and it’s made more impressive by the Australian actress’s seamless accent and affectations. It outdoes the category’s other contenders—Meryl Streep’s work in "August: Osage County" most notably, and Woody Allen’s best film in years would not succeed without it. —Austin Siegemund-Broka
 
Best Animated Feature: “Frozen”
The day “Frozen” does not win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film is the day eternal winter sweeps across Cambridge as protest for the Academy’s error. The Disney film is the most deserving nominee. It combines memorable music, plot and characters that defy typical Disney expectations, and complex animation into something surprisingly heart-warming. The “Let It Go” sequence illustrates this: Idina Menzel’s powerful voice, the way the animators manipulate snow and ice to create art and feats of architecture—every aspect captures attention. While the other nominees are commendable, particularly Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Wind Rises,” the power of “Frozen” is too great to pass over for the award. —Ha D.H. Le
 
Best Directing: Steve McQueen (“12 Years a Slave”)
"12 Years A Slave," as a narrative, is honestly rather straightforward, even borderline predictable. Enter unflinching auteur Steve McQueen, who singlehandedly transforms Solomon Northup's story into a haunting work of visual poetry. No other film of 2013, not even the visual stunner "Gravity," depended so heavily on who sat in the director's seat. Under McQueen's eye, the brutality of slavery gets the same treatment as the moss-dappled Southern landscape. Horror and beauty exist side-by-side in gorgeous, brutal technicolor. —Tree A. Palmedo
 
Best Original Score: William Butler & Owen Pallet (“Her”)
When the nominee list includes the celebrated John Williams, you know the competition is stiff. Regardless of the talent involved, William Butler and Owen Pallett deserve Best Original Score for “Her.” The two are newcomers as film composers, but this does not make them any less deserving. Combining orchestra and techno, their music reflects the film’s technological twist on a classic theme and masterfully bridges the gap between background music and story. The songs accomplish a feat unlike any other: they transform from accompaniment to character, adding tension to the story while embodying the protagonist’s raw emotions. It is a difficult job, and any score that achieves that should win. —Ha D.H. Le
 
Best Original Song: “The Moon Song” – Karen O (“Her”)
It’s perhaps the least dramatic of the nominated songs, but it’s also the most intimately personal. Karen O crafted a quiet and dreamy lullaby that’s as much about denial as it is about love, which is why it’s simultaneously heartbreaking and hopeful. Soft, self-conscious, and fragile, it nestles into Spike Jonze’s “Her” like a warm cheek into a cool pillow, and come the end of the movie, helps us realize that even the sweetest of songs can change from a willing embrace to the inability to let go. —Natalie T. Chang
 
Best Production Design: Adam Stockhausen & Alice Baker (“12 Years a Slave”)
The race should be between “The Great Gatsby” and “12 Years a Slave.” Though no period film I’ve seen holds a candle to the self-consciously garish, decadent, and sleazy world of “Gatsby”, stills from “12 Years a Slave” reveal what must have been a mythic effort to make costume and set constantly complement each other’s muted colors. I have a feeling that voters’ positive associations with the movie’s message will prevail. If the Academy turned off the sound and forgot that Catherine Martin has already won an Oscar in production design for “Moulin Rouge!” I would call it a sure thing. —Hayden S. Betts
 
Best Original Screenplay: Spike Jonze (“Her”)
“Sometimes I think I have felt everything I’m ever gonna feel,” Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) whispers about halfway through Spike Jonze’s “Her.” “And from here on out, I’m not gonna feel anything new. Just lesser versions of what I’ve already felt.” It’s the type of halting confession that only comes late at night, when it’s dark enough to make a first attempt at trust with someone new. It doesn’t matter that Theodore’s talking to an operating system—Theodore and OS Samantha stumble into a relationship that’s premised by necessity on words, and Jonze’s wistful but realistic screenplay makes us believe that’s possible without getting bogged down in self-importance or preachiness. —Natalie T. Chang

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It’s not rocket science, but it is if you’re the first person to do it,” professor Thomas F. Kelly said about the medieval advent of musical notation during “Capturing Music: Writing and Singing Music in the Middle Ages.” The lecture-performance event, which took place Sunday, was a collaboration between Kelly and the Blue Heron Renaissance Choir. Kelly, a music professor who teaches the popular Gen Ed course “First Nights,” took his First Church audience through the processes that took Europe from “ut-re-mi” to polyphony, a musical texture Kelly describes as Western music’s greatest contribution to the world.
Kelly began his lecture with the pre-notation years of liturgical music, during which songbooks acted solely as compilations of lyrics. He then related the Italian monk Guido of Arezzo’s invention of staff notation, which, according to Kelly, led sight-reading to “spread like fire.” With the advent of Gregorian chant, notation grew more sophisticated, moving closer to the system we know today. In examining this evolution, experts have been able to trace back modern symbols to the seemingly inscrutable medieval lines and lozenges that were the subject of Kelly’s discussion. “You have to think of these tiny units building up to enormous structures, in the way of Gothic architecture,” Kelly said. However, as he noted, some of the earliest notation present in medieval songbooks is so complex that it has yet to be decoded.
Throughout the event, members of Blue Heron, a Cambridge vocal ensemble well known for its historically informed performances of early music, illustrated Kelly’s points by singing several incarnations of the Easter hymn “Alleluya Pascha nostrum,” with each version changing dramatically in response to the corresponding musical style of the time. Beginning with a simple, monophonic rendition of the piece, Blue Heron then performed versions composed by the 12th-century polyphonist Léonin and the ars antiqua master Pérotin that were noticeably more complex, incorporating increasing numbers of vocal lines.
In addition to the polyphony provided by Blue Heron, the audience was treated to images of the medieval songbooks which were the original hosts for songs performed during the event. These songbooks are incredibly precise, often featuring entire pages taken up by a single word of chant. “This is going to be a long mass,” Kelly joked, looking at one such page. The songbooks, which Kelly translated from Latin for the audience, also frequently employed specific instructions about the number of performers demanded for each piece; one called for “at least three, but not two” singers to each line. “Good for those smart people who brought this music to parchment,” Kelly said. “It still lives.”
Kelly’s upcoming book, “Capturing Music: The Story of Notation,” expands on the topics covered in his lecture and will be released with a corresponding album of performances by Blue Heron. Such releases are somewhat uncommon in the world of classical music—medieval music sees relatively few performances compared to other genres due to its demanding nature, according to Kelly. “Why don’t we hear this more often? Probably because it’s very difficult to sing. They had the very best singers in the world at the cathedral in Paris, much like we have here this afternoon.”

No matter Pete Seeger’s radical associations—the folk-singer was a long-time member of the Communist Party USA and a backer of Henry Wallace’s 1948 presidential run—his life and music exemplify the sturdiest Judeo-Christian universalism. Starting out his career in the '30s, he sang workers’ anthems that demanded a revolution in material conditions. While Seeger’s commitment to left-wing causes never faltered, its expression morphed as his voice assumed a paternal timbre and his repertoire took an existential turn.
 
If “Solidarity Forever” had imagined the final victory of those who “built the cities where they trade,” “Oh, Had I A Golden Thread” offered a spiritual, and surprisingly mundane, vision of utopia. Penned in 1958, the song replaced the social-realist welder with the brave woman in labor, the pugilistic union member with the innocent toddler.
 
Behind the domestic theme lies a deep skepticism of modernity. Seeger’s privileging of life-cycle events over political ones bespoke a challenge to Marxist, and also Enlightenment, notions of history: in this case, a linear progression and the overcoming of the past. In his work, we measure time by milestones in the life of the family and the individual.
 
Most of us will raise children. Each of us will pass away. An awareness of death and recurrence lurks in Seeger’s oeuvre, and this comes through most powerfully in “Turn, Turn, Turn.” Its lyrics cribbed from the Book of Ecclesiastes, the song reminds us that to everything there is a season: “A time to gain, a time to lose, a time to rend, a time to sew, a time for love, a time for hate.” That could be seen as an invitation to nihilism, but Ecclesiastes’s message is fundamentally life-affirming: “A man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?”
 
Seeger’s home-in on the hearth also functioned as an attack on the state, particularly the totalitarian state. Much of this was thanks to the folk genre itself. From its distinctive song-writing process to its emphasis on audience participation, American folk embraces an egalitarian approach to hierarchy and a pre-commercial mode of cultural transmission. It refuses to allow the individual or family to be lost to the anonymity of the masses.
 
Seeger followed those imperatives to a tee. At one 1963 concert, he brought to the stage at Carnegie Hall the despair of a coal-miner’s wife, the joy of a newborn, the pity of Marilyn Monroe’s demise, and the elation of an emancipated slave. Little was outside his ken. “This Old Car” recounts the story of a vehicle’s break-down on New York’s West Side Highway. “Go Tell Aunt Rhodie” describes the death of a prized goose. Unsurprisingly, many pieces also address the state’s disruptive effect on family life. In “Mrs. McGrath,” the mother of a maimed Irish soldier condemns the monarchs of Europe: “By the heavens I’ll make ’em rue the time they struck the leg from a child of mine.” In “Where Have All The Flowers Gone?,” husbands, torn from their wives, are killed in battle. Prior to an ethos, Seeger had a pathos. That sympathetic quality allowed him to relate events, large and small, relevant and obscure, near and far, to his listeners.
 
Pathos could come at the expense of depth; reaction could go to excess. On one recording of “Careless Love,” Seeger mused, “Think of all those scientists and inventors who thought their invention was going to save the world, cure all the ills, and somehow, it just didn’t turn out right.” In a 1995 interview with the New York Times, he intimated, “I'm more conservative than Goldwater. He just wanted to turn the clock back to when there was no income tax. I want to turn the clock back to when people lived in small villages and took care of each other.” 
 
If his solution was wrong, the sense of crisis he felt after the Holocaust and during the bleakest years of the Cold War was palpable. In the “Origins of Totalitarianism,” Hannah Arendt had theorized, “We can no longer afford ... to discard the bad and simply think it of as a dead-load. ... The subterranean stream of Western history has finally come to the surface and usurped the dignity of our tradition.” Seeger lamented this dissonance in “Bach at Treblinka,” recalling how the Baroque composer’s work had greeted Hitler’s victims on their arrival at the camps. 
 
Arendt had called “for a new law on earth,” which would remain limited, even as it “comprehend[ed] the whole of humanity.” Seeger’s laws were timeless. Like the lyrics to “Turn, Turn, Turn,” they were borrowed from yesteryear. He was a cataloger of man’s experience, and from that arose his fight for universal dignity. 
 
Seeger crooned for Okies. Seeger agitated for unions. Seeger stood up to McCarthyism. Seeger campaigned and raised money for civil rights. Seeger cleaned up the Hudson River. He recycled and rewrote songs from one movement to the next, as much for convenience as in recognition of intersectionality. 
 
Compelled to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1955, he was told to identify himself in a photo taken at a Communist rally. “It is like Jesus Christ when asked by Pontius Pilate, ‘Are you king of the Jews?’” he replied.
 
Last month Pete Seeger died at the age of 94. He was a prophet in his own land.

With the onset of election season for Massachusetts’s gubernatorial race comes the candidates’ search for support from interest groups and other organizations. Many organizations send questionnaires to candidates to gauge their positions; politicians likewise use these questionnaires to make promises about actions they will take if elected.
While Democrat Juliette Kayyem and Republican Charlie Baker have promised in the name of transparency to reveal all questionnaires they complete, other gubernatorial candidates have determined that they would prefer a level of secrecy, revealing none or only some of their questionnaires. We support those politicians who have chosen the path of transparency, and urge those who have not yet promised to reveal all of their answers to do so. 
It is the candidates’ duty to express their positions clearly to voters prior to the election. Voters should be made fully aware of all of the stances that candidates have promised to uphold. This would enable citizens to best make informed and educated choices for governor, as well as to know what type of leadership and policy changes they can expect to be implemented.
Even if the questionnaires discuss topics already detailed in the candidates’ platforms, voters should have the opportunity to learn about candidates’ prioritization of these issues. At a minimum, no special groups should have greater access than the general public. While it is understandable that candidates may believe that full openness will alienate voters with different priorities, it is nevertheless critical that all voters have access to this knowledge, so that they can vote in accordance with their own preferences.
Moreover, given that very influential interest groups are involved, it is particularly imperative that voters have the most complete picture possible. Otherwise, the relationships between candidates and interest groups may remain shady and unclear, and the influence that interest groups hold on the candidates may become too strong.
It is true that it is difficult for candidates to fully articulate their positions on some of the questionnaires, especially if asked to rank how they feel about issues on a numerical scale. But if that is the issue, then candidates and interest groups could simply work to expand the questionnaires to a more detailed level. After all, if the average resident would struggle interpreting the numbers on a nuanced level, it stands to reason that interest groups would face the same problem. 
Regarding the final concern that positions elaborated through questionnaires would be taken out of context, the same can be said for any speech or candidate publication. Freely publishing the questionnaires in their entirety would allow voters to see a fuller picture of a candidate’s views, as well as his or her sidebar commitments to outside spending groups. That would lead to more transparent campaigns, which would serve the people of Massachusetts well.

Seeing as this column is focused on Twitter and its social media counterparts, I figured it would be fitting to incorporate at least one #tbt-style article, or “throwback Thursday” if you’re reading the print version (even though today is a Friday).
 
Invisible Children may not have accomplished the goal it set out to achieve, and its founder may have tarnished the reputation of both himself and his company in the process, but Kony 2012 unearthed the most potent marketing technique of the early 21st century.
 
For those of you either born within the past two years or somehow sheltered from this phenomenon, Kony 2012 was a YouTube video uploaded on March 5, 2012, aimed at heightening awareness of Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony’s severe human-rights abuses. Setting off chatter, the video challenged viewers to “make Joseph Kony famous” by sharing the film on their various social media platforms and putting up posters in their hometowns.
 
I could very easily discuss the merits of this campaign, the flaws of the message, and so on. Where did Invisible Children’s funding really go? Why are they blaming American politicians rather than Ugandan ones for this atrocity? What percentage of the video is actually based on factual evidence (not as much as you’d think)? But I prefer to not beat a dead horse. There are wonderfully written articles in the Washington Post and The Guardian already examining these topics in detail.
 
To me, the more compelling narrative behind this widely-publicized campaign is just how well it worked. Within four days, the video had garnered over 50 million views. After just a week, that number had risen to 75 million. So what did Invisible Children do differently from other humanitarian campaigns in order to win so much attention? World Vision posted a video with a similar message almost exactly two years prior to “Kony 2012”’s release, but that stagnated at a mere 2,464 views.
 
To some, the answer might be obvious. The video editing was unreal. The music connected with its intended audience. The interviews with Ugandans were perfectly placed, striking a balance with viewers between familiarity and novelty. Kony 2012 felt like something you’d watch in a movie theater with friends rather than alone in your room on your phone (like I did). This method—using entertainment value to deliver news is common to our times.
 
Above all else, however, Kony 2012 appealed to viewers’ sense of emotion rather than their sense of logic. Here, my high school English teacher would like me to include references to pathos and logos. By including footage of the founder’s five-year-old son, or his relationship with one Ugandan boy, viewers began to connect with the video in a way they otherwise would not have.
 
For me, Kony 2012’s chief allure was its ability to instantly empower anyone who viewed the documentary. We all have those really cool, hip friends who share cool, hip articles and get 15 to 20 likes, but not too many because that would be mainstream. Kony 2012 provided each and every one of us the opportunity to be that person. If you shared this video, everyone who scrolled through your Facebook or Twitter feeds would know that you were someone who was invested in the welfare of our planet, someone who paid attention to movements more relevant than bringing mozzarella sticks back to the cafeteria.
 
And while in that instance it was effective in drawing people in and raising awareness, social media has proven to be limited in making actual, real-life change. After sharing Invisible Children’s video, many felt a sense of accomplishment, that their contribution to the effort had been made. That was easy. How many people actually showed up for the April 20 “Cover the Night” event (excluding my little brother)? An absurdly smaller number than those who shared the video.
 
In this country, the social media age has given rise to a generation of complacency, where taking a link from one website and putting it on another is a sufficient social contribution. It’s easy to retweet, revine, or use that third-party app Regram for Instagram. Actually going out and doing something is not only much more arduous, but we aren’t rewarded with the favorites and likes that we so desire.
 
Perhaps I’m being naive, and the goal of Invisible Children was just to raise awareness and create a buzz. But I don’t think so. Kony is still out there. Bullies still terrorize students, women still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, drunk drivers still exist and kill people every single day. All these ideals we love to get behind online are certainly worthwhile, but at least until now, we have demonstrated that acting on them isn’t.

I love the government students here. Now I’m not talking about the ones concentrating in government, because why worry about stochastic Markov chains when you can have take-home exams instead. I mean the students who live at the Institute of Politics or serve in the Undergraduate Council, the ones who are already planning their congressional campaigns around the “Scandal” schedule so as to not miss an episode. These are the folks who regularly throw around terms like political capital, mostly to make themselves feel better because they will never have the kind of actual capital that the finance kids get for their signing bonuses.
 
Last week, our elected UC leaders took action into their own hands and decided to request an additional $250,000 in funding with which to polish the rest of the John Harvard statue, or something like that. UC President Gus Mayopoulos ’15, usually garbed in a vaguely Napoleonic uniform he picked up for 99 cents at a thrift shop, has led the charge. A meeting between Gus, co-conspirator Sietse Goffard ’15, and University President Drew G. Faust was scheduled for last Thursday.
 
Now we all know times are still tight, the endowment sits at a paltry $33 billion, and everyone has had to cut back to the essentials. Luckily, the day before the meeting, Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin ’89 announced a $150 million donation to Harvard, most of which is earmarked for financial aid. Even for the future hedge fund managers among us, $150 million is enough for at least three or four private islands. The UC’s request is only one sixth of one percent of this generous sum!
 
And so off went the dynamic duo on Thursday morning, with a spring in their step and their hats in their hands. Before meeting with President Faust, Gus and Sietse drummed up a crowd in the Yard, passing out toilet paper and used condoms to raise student support. The meeting proved less productive than the rally, and according to Mayopoulos, President Faust told the pair that “she didn’t necessarily think that it was realistic that the UC should expect this money to fall out of the sky.” President Faust, I am told, was scientifically correct, but could have sounded more insensitive only if she had Skyped into the meeting from her private villa somewhere in the Caribbean, swimming in a pool of $100 dollar bills.
 
So the UC has all but given up hope on ever seeing a slice of the Griffin pot pie, which by extension means that I, too, will not enjoy the fruits of Ken Griffin’s labor. Hot breakfast would have been nice, or two-ply toilet paper, or 30 million rounds of beer at Russell House. If Mr. Griffin really wanted to make a difference, he could have donated directly to the CVS in the Square, asking the store to spend his cash on thicker plastic bags. It’s the little things.
 
But the recent donation was overshadowed by an even bigger sum, which exceeds even the number of juniors who just landed jobs at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The groundbreaking news was the sale of the messaging app WhatsApp to Facebook for the equivalent of $19 billion. Suddenly $150 million ceases to seem like manna from heaven, and becomes little more than the dollar bill stuck to the lint in your jeans pocket after it came out of the dryer.
 
Instead of picking up WhatsApp, Facebook could have bought North Korea’s entire military and still have had enough leftover cash to pick up the Hubble Space Telescope. You think social media infringes on your privacy now? Just wait until Big Hubble is pointed directly at your open dorm window. Or Facebook could have given the UC its requested $250,000, and then bought the Panama Canal, twice. Maybe if Gus had worn jeans and a hoodie instead of an outfit made for Napoleon Dynamite, he could have gotten his $250,000. After all, I voted for Gus, not for Pedro. Well technically, I voted for Sam, but who’s keeping track?
 
Maybe Harvard is looking to buy some start-ups with its newfound discretionary cash. It could even buy a few started in dorms on campus! Or the university could use some of its money to seed a new hedge fund, managed by its recent graduates. One thing is very clear, though: The Undergraduate Council will see none of this money.
 
Because, hey, business is business.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I had a penny for every time I heard the following things from Harvard students, I would be a very rich queen: “We have a black President now, why is everyone still complaining about racism?” or “Why do all the gays hang out together, and why do they feel the need to act so gay around everyone?” or “All the people on financial aid need to stop complaining about being poor. They get to come here for free which makes it so easy, but my family has to pay full tuition so I should be the one complaining.”
It’s easy for people with specific privileges to believe that we are in, or should be in, a society that is post-queer, post-racial, and post-oppressive. They see all these offices and organizations at Harvard like the BGLTQ Office of Student Life, the Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the Queer Students & Allies, and Fuerza Latina. They see colleges encouraging applicants of diverse cultural, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds. They see special internships and jobs for people of color, queer people, and women. They see all these things and think everything is solved. And since everything must be solved they think: Why am I being excluded? Why don’t I get special privileges?
These “special privileges” exist for a reason: They are created to support students affected by the stigmas accompanying their identities. The “us and them” mentality, mentioned by the author of a recent Crimson op-ed, entitled “How Gay Pride Backfires,” is not created by these “special privileges” and offices and organizations—it is created by the histories of hatred and systematic oppression that accompany minority identities. The offices and organizations are created to support students who are made to feel like others because of the social stigma surrounding their identities. People who complain about not being included in these spaces should remember that they have the privilege of having a “safe space” everywhere in society—no one will ever question their right to be in most spaces because of their identity by virtue of being white, straight, wealthy, able-bodied, or a cisgender male.
Moreover, these offices and organizations are welcoming of privileged identities, even if it means taking up space that could be reserved for marginalized identities: The white race is included in the Harvard Foundation’s insignia; the “BGLTS” tutors at all the different Harvard houses do, in fact, include the word straight in their acronym instead of many other relevant marginalized identities such as two-spirit, gender-non-conforming, or queer. The student organization in which I am most involved, Queer Students & Allies, has the word “allies” in its own name and mission. The Women’s Center and Office of BGLTQ Student Life have prepared incredible student-led trainings on gender and sexuality (in which heterosexuality and cisgender men are discussed) that any organization or student can seek out at any time. Maybe if any of the people who are complaining about these entities actually needed the resources that these offices and organizations offered, they would have sought them out and realized that their identities are indeed included.
I encourage the more privileged among us (including myself) to really think before complaining about gay pride or anything else that seeks to support a marginalized group and about why those organizations exist. Think about the little kid growing up in a small, Evangelical school in the South coming to Harvard who never got to express his gender without shame. Think about how even though very few final clubs, sports teams, or other socially prestigious institutions that we laud as Harvard students are welcoming to him acting super queeny, that the QSA or the Office of BGLTQ Student Life or a lunch table full of other gays might be at least a small space where he can feel comfortable with his identity, one that is socially determined to be gross, sinful, and embarrassing.
And think about all the other experiences of marginalization that are caused by various stigmatized gender, racial, religious, disabled, and socioeconomic identities and statuses. While a post-oppressive society might be nice to imagine, groups that are affected by the reality of our discriminatory society need institutional support.
This isn’t an attempt to segregate. It’s an attempt to survive.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the time came for Harvard to launch its plan to build a sleek, new Allston campus across the Charles River, the University sought to develop the neighborhood surrounding its construction projects. 
Last October, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan for Allston. A month later, the Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory group to the BRA made up of Allston residents responsible for reviewing and shaping elements of Harvard’s vision for the neighborhood, approved a benefits package totaling $43 million in payments to the City of Boston for housing and workforce development and educational programs for the surrounding community.
The proposal stemmed from an initiative announced more than a decade ago by then-Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino to encourage Boston universities to create community benefits packages when launching large development projects, according to John A. Bruno, a member of the task force. Indeed, in recent years, area universities have begun providing community benefits that would have been unthinkable only a decade ago. 
But with construction beginning in Allston this spring, the verdict on Harvard’s multimillion dollar investment in the neighborhood across the Charles is still out.
Critical residents and task force members have juxtaposed Harvard’s benefits package with those offered by peer institutions and come to the conclusion that the University could do far more to appease the community. Others, however, see the benefits package as an important step toward fostering a productive relationship between institutions of higher learning and the communities that host them.
“Spoonfuls of Sugar”
Some Allston residents argue that Harvard, which boasts the largest university endowment in the world, has the resources to bring about lasting improvements to the Allston area but has thus far failed to meet expectations.
“The stuff they could be doing for the community could be on a massive scale,” said Allston resident Thomas Lally.
Some task force members, including Harry E. Mattison and Christina Marin, were disappointed after negotiations last November yielded a benefits package that they felt was less ambitious than they had anticipated.
Mattison and Marin wrote an op-ed published in The Crimson last November calling for Harvard to invest more to further Allston education and housing projects.
When the task force voted to approve the proposed benefits package later that day, Mattison voted against it and Marin abstained.
Mattison, who has called the Harvard-Allston relationship “transactional,” said that he has concerns that Harvard’s development does not directly benefit the community.
 
The “campus expansion is just an encroachment into our neighborhood,” he said, later adding “[Harvard offers] a spoonful of sugar of community benefits to wash away the bitter taste of a project [we] didn’t like. In my ideal world, [Harvard] would do projects that...inherently had a mutual benefit.”
 
Mattison and Marin have backed up their concerns by comparing the Allston benefits package to plans offered by other Ivy League universities.
Yale, they noted in their Crimson op-ed last fall, has spearheaded a homeowner program that has given $25 million over the last two decades to incentivize employees to become homebuyers in New Haven. They also pointed to The University of Pennsylvania, which has offered a yearly commitment of $700,000 to a single Philadelphia public school.
Harvard has also made a commitment to give $3 million to support Allston housing over ten years, yet Mattison called that figure “miserly in comparison” to Yale’s housing initiative. Furthermore, according to Mattison, Harvard has invested “less than a tenth of what Penn does” in Allston public schools.
Neither the Yale homeowner program nor the Penn education partnership was prompted by construction projects, like Harvard’s, raising questions as to how effective such comparisons can be when the contributions of a school to its community are presented in such different contexts and situations.
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin declined to comment for this article.
Raising the Bar? 
Though Harvard’s package has drawn comparisons to those of peers across the Ivy League, the proliferation of community development projects throughout the Boston area provides a better point of comparison, experts say.
 
Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, underscored that each school has a different approach to fostering a productive relationship with the surrounding community.
For example, MIT has offered a plan called the “Kendall Square Initiative,” which will build over a million square feet of housing, retail, lab, and commercial space in Kendall Square over the next seven to ten years, according to Sarah Gallop, the co-director of government and community relations at MIT. The initiative will also provide $14 million to a fund controlled by the Cambridge City Council to allocate funds for various community benefits.
Autler noted that, for instance, the densely populated urban neighborhoods around Northeastern will receive much wanted educational outreach and substantial investment in local businesses. On the other hand, the wealthier neighborhood of Beacon Hill, which houses Suffolk University, has asked for Suffolk to withdraw from the surrounding residential areas, as the community does not have a need for university programming and outreach.
Critics have compared the Harvard package to other university benefits proposals in order to highlight the limitations of the Allston plan. Autler and Gallop, however, advised against being swayed by those comparisons.
“Benefits packages don’t end up being a formulaic exercise but are specific to every institution and every neighborhood,” Autler said. "Every university interacts with a different community with its own needs and concerns."
Despite concerns raised by Allstonians and task force members, BRA representatives commended Harvard for creating what Autler calls a “very robust” benefits package.
“The University is throwing its resources behind groundbreaking and unique programs,” Autler said.
Autler sees the Harvard-Allston Education Portal as a clear example of a new commitment to engage with Allston. The Portal, created in 2008, offers mentoring and enrichment opportunities for neighborhood children and educational programs for adults. According to Autler, the Portal also acts as Allston’s single entry point to Harvard programming and benefits, such as speaker series and campus events.
Autler calls the Portal “an example for emulation elsewhere.”
In fact, the BRA recently brought the idea for an education portal to Northeastern, which will soon institute a “scaled back” version of the Harvard Portal as it begins new development plans, according to Autler.
 
Kairos Shen, the chief planner at the Boston Redevelopment Authority, said at a task force meeting last November that Harvard is “raising the bar” for community benefits.
Bruno went further, saying that Harvard, the most recent school to develop and implement a community benefits package, has become a leader for local universities.
“By default [Harvard has] taken on more of a leadership role,” Bruno said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


A panel featuring Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy and others debated the pros and cons of affirmative action Thursday evening at the Law School’s Ames Court Room.
Arguing that affirmative action does more harm than good, University of San Diego Law professor Gail Heriot and University of California, Los Angeles Law professor Richard H. Sander asserted that affirmative action reduces the percentage of minorities who succeed at selective academic institutions.
On the opposing side, Columbia Law School professor Theodore M. Shaw and Kennedy argued in favor of affirmative action as a means of advancing university goals while benefitting the educational experiences of all students.
“The very large preferences that are now routinely employed by colleges and universities produce fewer, not more, black scientists, black engineers, and black medical doctors,” said Heriot, who is also a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “We are talking epic policy failure.”
Citing Sander’s research as evidence, Heriot’s team argued that less-equipped minority students admitted to select universities were drastically more likely to drop out of STEM fields. According to Sander, admitting less qualified students to selective universities under the pretense that they have an equal chance to succeed ignores empirical studies suggesting that this assumption is false.
Shaw countered that minority students should have the ability to choose whether to accept a place at a selective university. He said that students cannot begin to succeed without first receiving the opportunity to attend college.
Kennedy agreed, stressing the educational benefits of diversity.
“The benefits...are not merely theoretical, but real,” he said.
Before the debate began, a survey of the audience showed that 22 percent said they believed that affirmative action does more harm than good, while 48 percent said they did not agree and 30 percent said they were undecided. Upon the conclusion of the debate, 36 percent said they supported the statement and 55 percent said they were against, with only 9 percent reporting that they were still undecided.
Audience members had mixed reactions to the way the debate was handled.
“I thought the debate was really interesting and civil...people had a lot at stake with what they were arguing,” first year Law student Samuel F. Callahan said.
Others, who found the voting aspect of the debate troublesome, said they supported the overall cause.
“The voting aspect through the debate may have been an interesting way of gaining public relations interest,” Special Program instructor James L. Frankel said. “But [the voting aspect was] ill-founded...it’s an unscientific way of measuring how successful the debate was.”
The event, co-sponsored by the Harvard Federalist Society and the American Constitution Society, was produced by Intelligence Squared, an organization dedicated to promoting public discourse.
“We were thrilled to have been invited to the Harvard Law School…and to present here,” said S. Dana Wolfe, executive producer of Intelligence Squared U.S. Debates.
The event was broadcast live on the Law School website and will air on National Public Radio.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


A panel of seven professional athletes, including two active NFL quarterbacks, agreed that technology will play an increasingly larger role in sports at a discussion at the Harvard Innovation Lab in Allston on Thursday.
According to the panelists, professional and ammateur athletes will benefit from upcoming technological inventions that focus on improved data related to health and physical performance. More specifically, they said, comprehensive numerical analysis on everything from heart rate to muscle exertion will allow coaches and players to optimize athletic ability and minimize injury.  
Isaiah J. Kacyvenski ’00, a retired NFL linebacker who now serves as chairman of the sports advisory board at the sports technology firm MC10, joined fellow board members, including Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew A. Luck, Colts backup quarterback Matt M. Hasselbeck, and U.S. Olympic women’s ice hockey four-time medalist Angela M. Ruggiero ’02-’04.
Retired U.S. women’s soccer star Kristine M.L. Heavey, professional lacrosse standout Paul Rabil, and former Major League Soccer Most Valuable Player Taylor Twellman, all also MC10 board members, also spoke at the event. Harvard Business School professor Anita Elberse moderated the discussion.
MC10 is a Cambridge-based venture-capital-backed company that, according to Kacyvenski, “revolves around flexible, high-performance electronics.”
“In the end, our goal is to leave you with a seamless sensing experience—to put a wearable device on, forget about it, [and] gather data in the background,” Kacyvenski said. “We can then give you a way to think about your health in a different way, think about your performance in a different way, [and] take a proactive approach to your health.”
The panelists agreed that as technology becomes a more integral part of professional athletics,  MC10’s innovations will give athletes an extra boost.
“At some point in time, your natural abilities aren’t going to be enough,” Ruggiero said. “I think at that point in time...you actually decide as an athlete that you want to get even better.”
“I think whenever that point in time is, the application of real-time data—whatever metrics it may be—will help you increase as an athlete,” she added.
According to i-Lab Director Jodi Goldstein, the panel was brought to Harvard because MC10’s mission strongly aligns with that of the i-Lab.
“In a similar way to how we at the i-Lab have a very cross-discipline approach to innovation...[MC10] is doing the exact same thing,” Goldstein said. “They have top athletes across all the different sports coming together in a board capacity to try to identify new products and innovations.”
The panel was well-received by many audience members, which included a large contingent of varsity athletes.
“I think the answers [the panelists] gave were very eloquent and on the point,” said Rohan S. Ramnath ’16, a member of the Harvard men’s golf team. “It was definitely a good experience to hear what elite athletes have to say because as an athlete myself, I hopefully can someday be like them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It shows up in the dining halls in a multitude of ways: with cilantro and lime, honey ginger glaze, or as a crispy sandwich. But the status of swai, a staple for Harvard University Dining Services, is not so clean cut outside of Cambridge, where competing claims on the fish's sustainability and distribution have raised debate about the endangered fish.
For most students, little is known about the fish, despite its prevalence on the HUDS menu since the fall of 2012.  Swai, which is indigenous to Southeast Asia, is also known by its scientific name, Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, and for its prevalence as a hobby aquarium fish, in which context it is referred to as the iridescent shark.
It is also a popular white-flesh fillet in the United States, selling at grocery stores for a mere four dollars per pound. In Harvard dining halls, according to an emailed statement from HUDS director for marketing and communications Crista Martin, the fish is served two to three times during HUDS’s four-week cycle.
While Swai’s presence in Cambridge has grown, its population in the wild has declined rapidly during the past two decades.
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, Swai is an endangered species. The IUCN reports that due to “overexploitation, habitat degradation, and changes in water quality and flow” the species has been nearly extirpated from rivers in both Thailand and Cambodia.
Martin wrote that Harvard has worked to alleviate environmental concerns by purchasing farm-raised swai.
“The swai we serve is a farmed product, imported, and our vendor, North Coast Seafood, works closely with this and other aquaculture business to ensure that its coming from a reputable source that complies with all USFDA regulations,” Martin wrote.
Barton Seaver, a well-known chef and author of the book “For Cod and Country,” has worked closely with HUDS to develop its menu and originally suggested adding the embattled fish to dining halls as an alternative to red meat.
“I recommended it because it is a lean, clean, delicious protein,” Seaver said. “It enables chefs to be creative.”
When asked about its endangered status, Seaver noted that swai is a product that can be produced and sourced in a sustainable manner.  According to Seaver, 100 percent of the swai sold in the U.S. is farm-raised.  He also praised North Coast Seafood—Harvard’s distributor for swai.
“[North Coast] takes great pride and care in the wholesomeness…and sustainability of its product,” Seaver said.
Still, some have warned against eating swai, claiming that certain antibiotics that are banned in the U.S. are used on these fish in Vietnam. Prevention.com called Swai one of the “Unhealthy Fish to Avoid Eating” and The Food & Water Watch listed it as one of their “Dirty Dozen” seafoods.
Sebastian Cianci, a spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration, refuted these concerns, adding in an email that if there were a concern with antibiotics, the FDA would keep the product from entering the American market and place Swai vendors on “import alert.”
“The laws and regulations FDA enforces and the programs it oversees are designed to ensure that the food reaching U.S. consumers is safe to eat,” Cianci wrote. “This includes the food being served in the Harvard cafeteria.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 28, 2014, at 2:00 p.m.
A movement to limit the size of course sections to 12 students that began among a small group of graduate students last fall has grown into a formal campaign backed by members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and endorsed by the University’s Philosophy Department.
At the center of the movement, which has coalesced under the name the Harvard Teaching Campaign in recent weeks, is a petition calling “on the University to fulfill its promises of excellence” by setting the cap.
But much of the support the campaign has found within FAS thus far has been in the form of faculty advocacy. From written endorsements on the campaign’s website to email blasts to class lists, professors have broadened the discussion of section size, including College students as well.
According to Philosophy professor Richard Moran, the Philosophy Department endorsed the campaign for three primary pedagogical reasons and will soon post a statement about the endorsement on its website.
Moran said that the statement has “gained very quick and easy support.”
Specifically, the statement cites inhibited student participation and a poorer teaching experience for teaching fellows that hinders their training as instructors as justification to reduce the size of sections. It also points to increased financial insecurity for graduate students that results from fewer total teaching jobs caused by larger section sizes.
“Increasing the number of teaching sections will cost a tiny percentage of the FAS 1.2 billion dollar budget. This is exactly where Harvard, as an educational institution, should be investing,” the statement reads. The statement concludes by urging other Harvard departments to back the campaign and the petition.
“I think this is an issue where undergraduates, faculty and graduate students are all on the same side,” Moran said.
History professor Daniel L. Smail said he agrees. In an email Wednesday, he urged students enrolled in his class, Culture and Belief 51: “Making the Middle Ages,” to sign the petition, writing that the University investment required would be modest given the educational benefit students would receive.
Smail said that he asked the General Education Office to let him limit the size of sections in the course. CB51’s sections have about 13 students each, he said, adding that he does not think “faculty should generally have to lobby for [small sections].”
Smail also said that it is his impression that section sizes are currently limited to 18 students, but prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the Office of Undergraduate Education was often able to accommodate smaller section sizes.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that the target section size for most lecture courses is 18 students, though the size “varies depending on the type of course.” For example, for courses with labs, studio courses or “quantitative Methods courses,” the target size is 15 students. For language courses, it varies from 10 to 18 students. 
Members of the Teaching Campaign also asked for signatures at  a town hall meeting last week, co-sponsored by the group and the Graduate Student Council, that attracted about 40 people. That discussion, which ranged from section sizes to teaching fellow payment to the hiring process for teaching fellows, will be followed by two other similar meetings  in March.
At the first town hall meeting, graduate students raised concerns over the size of sections, highlighting the  lower-quality discussions, increased work for teaching fellows, and even safety risks in laboratory settings that they said result when sections are too big.
According to an email from one of the petition’s organizers, graduate student John. M. Nicoludis, the document will continue to circulate for the “foreseen future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, Harvard men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker shares with the team’s seniors his own experiences as a senior playing in his final home contest for Duke. As Amaker noted, quite a bit has changed in college basketball over the years, but the tradition of Senior Night is one thing that is readily relatable to all players: the emotion of the pregame recognition, followed by the need to immediately shift focus to what happens on the court.
But for senior Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry, who returned to school this year after taking a year off in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating case, this Friday’s Senior Night against Cornell might mean a little bit more.
“It kind of hasn’t hit me yet, I kind of don’t want it to, thinking about the last time I’m going to suit up at Lavietes [Pavilion],” Curry said.
“It’s definitely going to be a special moment. I’ve got some more family coming up, and I’m just going to enjoy it.”
Amaker discussed how the journeys of Casey and Curry to get back to school were made more difficult by the fact that their names were the only ones released in association with the scandal. While other students that had to take time off at least avoided the ignominy of having their involvement made public, Casey and Curry have had to deal with the backlash from the outside world, as well as the jeers of opposing fans.
“I’m incredibly proud of those guys for what they had to endure and how they handled it and how, in a lot of ways, they became the face of [the scandal] for everybody…. I thought those guys were magnificent with it,” Amaker said.
Though the two seniors’ roles have changed substantially since re-entering the program—largely in order to accommodate the rise of sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers and junior guard Wesley Saunders—their team’s success has them right where they hoped they would be when they came back. The Crimson sits atop the Ivy League and, after a road sweep of Penn and Princeton,  is in control of its own destiny.
“This is what they wanted to return to do, to be in a position like this,” Amaker said. “It’s a long way before anything ever ends in terms of our regular season, but we’re in position.”
Curry and Casey will be honored in a ceremony before the game along with co-captain Laurent Rivard, Dee Giger, and Tom Hamel.In what was perhaps a savvy scheduling move, the Crimson will be able to deal with those distracting emotions against a struggling opponent in the last-place Big Red, which has won only one Division I game all year.
Saturday night’s test will be far stiffer, as Columbia comes to Cambridge fresh off of its first Ivy League weekend sweep since 2009. The Lions, which dealt Yale its second conference loss of the year, will be looking to avenge a double-overtime defeat suffered to the Crimson on Valentine’s Day.
On defense, Harvard’s main challenge will be containing junior forward Alex Rosenberg, the Ivy’s fourth-leading scorer (15.8 points per game) and top three-point shooter (44.2 percent). In the teams’ last meeting, Rosenberg scored a career-high 34 points on 10-of-17 shooting. Rosenberg’s lowest point total in conference play was 12 in a Feb. 1 loss at Brown. He has averaged 21.7 points per game in the six contests since.
The Crimson has an outside shot of clinching its fourth consecutive Ivy League regular season championship and third straight NCAA tournament berth this weekend, as Yale pays visits to Princeton on Friday and Penn on Saturday. If the Bulldogs lose both contests and Harvard sweeps, the Crimson will have a three-game lead in the standings with two games to play.
More likely is that this weekend’s play will set the stage for a pivotal game next Friday night in New Haven, when Harvard travels to Payne Whitney Gymnasium for a showdown against its archrival, with massive title implications on the line.
Chances are that the Crimson will not be looking that far ahead. At Monday’s media conference, Curry was surprised to learn that Yale had even been in action the day before and that his team was a game clear in the standings. For now, Curry and his Harvard teammates are only looking to avoid a letdown against Cornell on what promises to be an emotional night.
“It’s easy to fall into the trap of ‘Oh, we’re at home, it’s going to be easy—it’s senior week, so it should be easy,” Curry said. “But I know this team, and I know that we certainly won’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks are left in Ivy League play, which means a couple of things. At Harvard, we are stuck in the romantic abyss between Valentine’s Day and the Owl lawn party, with midterms rising as spring break waits—like a bright Cancun beach—on the horizon. For Princeton and Penn, ’tis the season for championship runs. In a single 40-year run,  one or the other won the league 37 times, making the Yale-Harvard football rivalry (with just three similar finishes) a footnote by comparison. Every year, the two face off in the final game of the Ivy League season, with a championship often on the line.
But, for all the hype, Penn and Princeton’s championship hopes have become a lot like River Run. Both were once great, but sterling Harvard youth have put an end to these shenanigans. With its sweep of the pair last weekend, the Crimson moved to 4-0 on the year against its two main rivals.
Not only did the Crimson sweep both teams for the first time in Harvard history, but it moved just one win away from making the final game of the season irrelevant once again. Princeton has already been eliminated from playoff contention; Penn and its 1-10 road record are just a loss away.
For Harvard, the key challengers down the stretch will be Yale, Columbia, and Brown. To put that in context, the three schools have combined for one top-two Ivy League finish in the last five years. Columbia in particular hasn’t done so yet this century, a putrid run that included a 2-25 2002-2003 team that lost its final 18 games. But at least there’s football.
The two-week mark means something else: Senior Night. Seniors at Harvard, Dartmouth, and Penn will be playing their final games in front of their home crowds on Saturday (Princeton hosts Penn in two weeks, so its seniors have time).
I’d like to take a moment to salute the seniors: Harvard’s Brandyn Curry, Laurent Rivard, Kyle Casey, Dee Giger, and Tom Hamel; Dartmouth’s Tyler Melville; and Penn’s Miles Jackson-Cartwright, Fran Dougherty, Dao Jok, Cameron Gunter, and Steve Rennard. College basketball in the Ivy League is not the sensationalized ESPN product the mainstream sport has become. Mandatory cliché: the league is one of the only NCAA outposts where student-athlete remains an appropriate term.
Judging by the track record of Ivy League basketball players—Jeremy Lin ’10 and Bill Bradley excluded—most of these athletes will never play at the next level. The only pre-professional part of their lives is in the classroom—or Vertias Financial Group. That statement is anything but representative of the major programs the Ivy champ plays in the NCAA Tournament. Six of the seven Kentucky players that took the court against Princeton in 2011 have had an NBA shot; the Vanderbilt team that Harvard faced the next year had three starters drafted in the top-35.
But this is the time of the season when those issues are—rightfully or not—pushed under the rug. Saturday marks the first day of March and utopia for college basketball fans. Just like last year, Harvard goes into the season’s penultimate weekend with a one-game lead and an HYP rival breathing down its neck. Time to play ball.
On to the games.
YALE V. PRINCETON
The last meeting between these teams, a 66-65 Yale overtime victory, was arguably the best game of the Ivy League season. The Tigers took a double-digit lead into halftime but Yale battled back to force extra minutes behind sophomore Justin Sears. The Elis eked out the win on a Sears putback with 4.4 seconds left to run Yale’s winning streak over Princeton to three. Now Sears and the Bulldogs, who are a game back of Harvard with four to play, control their Ivy League destiny. A loss at Jadwin, where Yale has won just once in the last four years, would put the Bulldogs’ title hopes in serious danger.
A year ago, Princeton came into New Haven in a similar position: win out and go to the Dance. A 71-66 loss cost the Tigers the league lead—a misstep the next night in Providence cost it a playoff. Princeton coach Mitch Henderson hasn’t forgotten what happened, and he will make sure his team hasn’t either.  
Pick: Princeton
BROWN V. PENN
Sophomore Bears forward Cedric Kuakumensah had 30 points, 14 rebounds, and seven blocks last week against Cornell to break his own program record for blocked shots in a single season. Against Penn, junior Bears center Rafael Maia and Kuakumensah—who ranked one-two in the conference in rebounds per game last year—will look to dominate a Penn front line with little depth behind sophomore Darien Nelson-Henry.
A quick shout-out to Nelson-Henry’s beard, which—like his post game—has become sneaky good. Chris Kaman remains the standard for basketball player facial hair but the All-Ivy Facial Growth Team—Nelson-Henry, Harvard senior Dee Giger, Dartmouth senior Tyler Meville, Penn junior Henry Brooks, and Cornell junior Deion Giddens—deserves recognition. Stay warm, men, stay warm.
Pick: Brown
COLUMBIA V. DARTMOUTH
Since sweeping Penn and Princeton, the Big Green has lost six straight by at least nine points. This team needs Lithuanian forward Gabas Maldunas (out for the year) in a bad way. Columbia comes into the elven wilderness of Hanover on a roll, with the Lions’ only loss in their past four contests to Harvard in double overtime.
Notable sophomore Lions guard Maodo Lo has found his stride recently, averaging 18.2 points a game over the last two weeks. Lo gets brownie points for his Spectator-given nickname: “The Chairman.” Simply awesome.  
Pick: Columbia
CORNELL V. HARVARD
2010: Cornell 29-5, Harvard 21-7
2014: Harvard 22-4, Cornell 2-22
Do you remember the first game of the season, when this Cornell team was up eight at halftime on Syracuse? Me neither.
Pick: Harvard
BROWN V. PRINCETON
In what has been a lost season for the Tiger faithful, senior point guard T.J. Bray has been a lone bright spot. Bray leads the league in both points and assists but works efficiently, putting up remarkable 55-42-80 shooting splits.
Interesting aside about Bray: as a senior in high school, he turned down a full scholarship from Florida Gulf Coast. While watching teammate Hans Brase miss a wide-open dunk late in the second half of last week’s 59-47 loss to Harvard, I wondered if he briefly regretted turning down Dunk City for Clunk City.
Pick: Princeton
YALE V. PENN
To those uninitiated in Ivy League basketball, I’d like to set straight a couple common misconceptions. First, Harvard isn’t the only school to recruit better in recent years; both teams here have one three-star recruit (and Penn has 14 two-stars) on the roster. Second, Armani Cotton is not the name of a Snooki-sponsored female clothing line—he’s a starting Bulldog forward. Finally, if the YDN does cover this game, you can read about it not on Saturday, but on Monday. I’ll take it a step further and pre-emptively ignore this game before it happens. 
Pick: Yale
CORNELL V. DARTMOUTH
Cornell-Dartmouth is a lot like Freshman Formal: You don’t want to go and if you do, you won’t remember it the next morning. 
Pick: Dartmouth
COLUMBIA V. HARVARD
The Lions’ trip to Harvard conjures up a familiar memory: the 2011 visit Penn—and stud Jewish point guard Zack Rosen ’12—made to Cambridge. Fresh off scoring the Quakers’ final 16 points a night earlier against Dartmouth, Rosen came alive late with Penn’s final nine in the Quakers’ 55-54 win in Lavietes to cut Harvard’s league lead to one heading into the season’s final weekend.
Junior Columbia forward Alex Rosenberg will come in and try to duplicate Rosen’s play to tear out the hearts of Crimson fans—and specifically, that of one Alexander L. Koenig—again. Per game, the former Maccabiah Games star averages 16 points, four rebounds, and—as a member of the tribe myself, I speculate with experience—three“Oy vey, he shoulda been a lawyer” cries from his mother.
Rosenberg will be heading into hostile territory—Harvard has won 47 of its last 51 contests at Lavietes—and, likely, a harder matchup. After co-captain Laurent Rivard was torched by Rosenberg for 34 points last time out, expect junior wing Wesley Saunders to get the call.
With Saunders on Rosenberg, Harvard will force the Lions’ secondary unit to excel. Sophomore Lions guard Grant Mullins may be the league’s most under-the-radar scorer, but he will have to shine in prime time to keep Columbia’s title hopes alive.
On the offensive end, Harvard will need more out of Saunders, who has seven single-digit scoring efforts this season after just one all of last year. The pesky Lions have played Harvard tough recently—two of the past five matchups have gone into overtime—but the Crimson has enough defensively to grind out a close win.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After suffering an undisclosed health concern that required a medical procedure earlier this month, Harvard football coach Tim Murphy is recovering at home and is in good condition.
“Murphy, The Thomas Stephenson Family Head Coach for Harvard Football, is recovering well from a medical issue he suffered earlier this month,” according to a statement by the Harvard Athletic Department.
“He is expected to make a complete and full return to all coaching activities beginning this spring.”
After remaining at the hospital for a few days following an operation, Murphy has been recovering at his home in Wayland, Mass., over the past several weeks. The 57-year-old coach originally notified members of the football team of his medical situation three weeks prior to the surgery.
“We were told that [Murphy] was having a certain medical procedure done and he’s been home recovering, and that it went well,” captain Norman Hayes said. “We weren’t told anything specific.”
In his 20th season at the helm of Crimson football, Murphy guided the team to a 9-1 record and its 15th Ivy League title—the Wayland native’s seventh in his tenure at Harvard. He is a five-time recipient of the New England Coach of the Year award and is third in Ivy history in career coaching victories with 137.
Under Murphy, no four-year Harvard player has ever graduated without winning an Ancient Eight title. The coach’s absence has been felt.
“Of course it affects [offseason routines] not having the lead man, his presence in drills, but it hasn’t affected it in a negative way,” Hayes said. “Coach Murphy [is] always talking about dealing with adversity, and I think it’s a true testament to his leadership that we’ve been able to handle this as a team.”
In Murphy’s absence, offensive coordinator Joel Lamb and defensive coordinator Scott Larkee have assumed head coaching duties. Over the past few weeks, they have managed offseason practices and drills in preparation for Murphy’s return to spring practices.
“[Lamb has] been a good coach,” Hayes said. “He’s been there supporting us in every one of the drills. Both coach Lamb and coach Larkee…have been communicating with the team what to work towards, and [making] sure we still have the end goal of the season in mind.”

It looks like all the fanfare surrounding Housing Day might turn into a battle of the Beyoncés—because not just one, but at least two, Houses are throwing around the idea of making a Yoncé-themed Housing Day video this year.
 
Is it too good to be true? Absolutely not—as every Harvard student, American, and citizen of the world knows, when it comes to Beyoncé, all things are possible.
 
Both Lowell and Winthrop have drawn on inspiration from Queen Bey to sell eager freshmen on their House, bringing us “Drunk in Lowell” and “Love on Throp.”
 
Is this too much Beyoncé for one Housing Day? See above. The more Beyoncé, the better.
 
But this does beg the question: Which Beyoncé is better? “Love on Throp” (derived from “Love on Top”) shows off sassy, upbeat Beyoncé. She’s fun, energetic, and happy-sexy. “Drunk in Lowell” (see “Drunk in Love”) is the Queen’s newest hit. It’s soulful, powerful, and every kind of sexy possible. And the Lowell video looks promising—props to the seemingly-confused Lowell House masters sippin’ that tea in the video trailer.
 
The good news (or bad news, depending on your perspective), freshmen, is that you don’t have to choose which one you like better. The Housing Gods will decide which Beyoncé you belong with in just a few short weeks.
 
But, while we’re on the subject, all this talk about Beyoncé makes us wonder: When is Beyoncé coming to Harvard?
