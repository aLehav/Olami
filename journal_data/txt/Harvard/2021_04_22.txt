After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years since her last album, Demi Lovato made a triumphant return to the music scene with “Dancing With The Devil… The Art of Starting Over.” The album comes in the wake of her 2018 heroin overdose and is accompanied by a documentary series unpacking the events that led up to her hospitalization. The album’s greatest strengths lie in Lovato’s undeniably exceptional vocal ability and in her hooks. However, awkward phrasing and overly specific lyrics in the verses and pre-choruses on some songs detract from their listenability, resulting in an inconsistent record.
The album is split into two pieces that cover the last two and a half years of Lovato’s life. The “Dancing With The Devil” section of the album comprises three songs, and chronicles her overdose. The album opens with “Anyone,” the song she sang at the 62nd Grammy’s in her first time returning to the stage post-overdose. Accompanied by just a piano, Lovato’s voice soars, a driving force all on its own, and her pain bursts forth with her high sustained belt, crying out for “anyone” to listen to her. The following track, “Dancing With The Devil,” recounts her relapse and “ICU (Madison’s Lullabye)” places her in a hospital bed speaking to her younger sister, Madison De La Garza. The latter’s lyrics focus on references to sight, even in the title (“ICU” takes on two meanings, both Intensive Care Unit and “I See You”). In her documentary series, Lovato explains that she was unable to see when she first woke up in the hospital and therefore couldn’t recognize her sister. “Anyone” is the strongest of these three songs, and, along with “ICU,” it is the most emotionally vulnerable. “ICU” ends with De La Garza saying “I love you Demi” and Lovato replying “I love you too,” and while it is a sweet moment for the sisters, it detracts from the song’s listenability.
Lovato begins the second half of her album, which narrates her recovery, with “Intro,” a spoken interlude. While the purpose of this interlude is clear — to introduce her new self — it falls flat as the result of overly dramatic pauses and canned lines, coming across as a bad slam poem. It contrasts starkly with Lovato’s use of speech in “The Kind Of Lover I Am,” which feels candid, lighthearted, and fun.
The first track of the second half of the album, “The Art Of Starting Over,” elicits feelings of cruising during the summer in a vintage convertible with all the windows down, effectively creating a sonic separation between the two halves of the album. However, the first verse has a weak opening, with overuse of a time motif that doesn’t hold relevance to the rest of the song: “I'm like a watch, I'm unwinding like a clock / It's okay if I don't know what the time is.”
Vocally, Lovato is strong across the board in both her lower and upper registers, as well as in breathy and belt moments. As a songwriter, however, she is inconsistent. Some tracks, like “Dancing With The Devil” and “My Girlfriends Are My Boyfriend (feat. Saweetie),” have excellent hooks but awkward verses while others, like “Butterfly” and “15 Minutes,” have good verses and pre-choruses but lazy hooks.
The opening line of “My Girlfriends Are My Boyfriend”: “I found the love of my life / Wait I mean the loves of my life” exemplifies the lyrical issues Lovato runs into throughout the album. At times, Lovato tries to over-explain her experiences, which results in awkward and unnecessary exposition if the listener has watched the accompanying documentary. Lovato’s lyrical details sometimes become so specific that they bring the listener out of the song as the lyrics become far less applicable universally.
Another inconsistency in the album lies in its features. Two of the strongest songs on the album feature Ariana Grande (“Met Him Last Night”) and Noah Cyrus (“Easy”). Grande, like Lovato, is known for her vocal prowess. To hear these two vocal powerhouses with different strengths team up and compliment each other was a highlight of the album, with Grande’s breathier, warmer tone playing against Lovato’s bright high belt. “Easy” has a beautiful chorus with repeating note patterns that create a rise and fall effect. Cyrus brings out the softer side of Lovato’s voice on this record, and she serves as a balance on the chorus because her mix is headier than Lovato’s. Meanwhile, “My Girlfriends Are My Boyfriend” sounds like a song that should feature Doja Cat rather than Saweetie, whose verse is not particularly memorable, except for the somewhat humorous line “And they got my back like a chiropract(or)”
Although Lovato has been known throughout her career for uptempo bangers such as “La La Land,” “Confident,” and “Sorry Not Sorry,” her ballads and midtempo tracks are what shine on this album. Songs like “Anyone,” “The Way You Don’t Look At Me,” and “Easy (with Noah Cyrus)” walk the line between deeply personal and universally relatable.
Due to its inconsistencies, “Dancing With The Devil… The Art of Starting Over” is not an album that can just be listened to straight through. ”The Art of Starting Over” gets weaker as it continues, and none of the songs after “Easy“ are as strong as the first half of the segment. However, if the listener wants to feel nostalgic, “Good Place” does feel reminiscent of “Lightweight” with its melody and key.
Perhaps the most important lesson this album teaches us is the importance of the art to an artist, and how music can be healing not just for the listener, but for the musician themself. With its hyperspecific lyrics and its personal storytelling, in “Dancing With The Devil… The Art of Starting Over,” Lovato isn’t making music for us — she’s making it for herself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another spring brings another newly admitted class of Harvard students — and with it, a new record-breakingly low acceptance rate. On April 7, high school seniors from across the globe logged into the Harvard admissions portal; just under 2,000 of the 57,000 applicants received a letter starting with “Congratulations!”.
We remember that moment well — for most of us, it was marked by the euphoria of a seemingly impossible dream coming true. Unfortunately, this year’s 3.43 percent acceptance rate only edifies the myth that getting accepted into Harvard is indeed impossible.
We hope this dauntingly low number does not deter future applicants — admissions rates reveal nothing about an individual’s chances of admission, especially during such bizarre times. As for the tens of thousands of undoubtedly brilliant students who were met with unfavorable results: Please remember that this doesn’t reflect anything about you or your potential. It’s a harsh mathematical reality, the inevitable product of a steady increase in applicants amidst stagnant enrollment numbers during a pandemic-induced crisis.
But if that 3.43 percent is jarring, we must also acknowledge that it came with many encouraging trends. A full 18 percent of admitted students for the Class of 2025 identify as Black, in comparison to only 14.8 percent last year; the percentage of students who identify as Latinx also rose to 13.3, up from 12.7. Our community is increasingly economically diverse too: For the first time in Harvard’s (long) history, more than 20 percent of the admitted class is Pell Grant eligible.
That leads us to believe that the high number of applicants, while creating a low acceptance rate, is representative of a growing awareness that Harvard can be accessible (and, crucially, affordable) to applicants from a variety of backgrounds. We’re proud to note this improvement, a positive development in a system that oftentimes exacerbates inequity.
Granted, an improvement doesn’t mean the battle is won. Harvard must continue to increase the accessibility of its application process, including by making its generous financial aid program more visible to those who might benefit. Our currently exclusive façade can prove significantly discouraging; cohesive outreach efforts could let more students know that Harvard might not be impossible afterall.
Still, congratulations are in order for the crafters of the historic class. We commend Harvard’s Admissions Office for their efforts to accept a wide range of students. Their decision to make the SAT optional might have proved crucial in making Harvard’s application accessible to more prospective students, and we’re glad that the policy will extend until at least next year. We hope that, going forward, Harvard remains transparent about how going test-optional might impact admissions, as well as what percentage of test optional students were admitted.
We are also pleased that Harvard chose to admit a full class, despite the nearly 350 students who deferred from the last admission cycle. The decision is a laudable investment in the Class of 2025, one that shows Harvard’s commitment to its educational mission.
But despite our emphasis on the numbers, these accepted students are far from just statistics — they are our future classmates, neighbors, and friends who will come to define post-Zoom Harvard. They are the students who we will welcome into our communities next Housing Day and who will, a year later, welcome an entirely new class themselves. We are excited to discover their passions and talents, quirks and idiosyncrasies, and to see them explore and bring to life our little Cambridge corner.
To the newly admitted Class of 2025, welcome to Harvard — we are so happy to have you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Back in 2019, I worked part-time at the local hospital. One of my tasks each evening was to push these large steel tanks containing patients’ dinners to different areas of the hospital, and one of the locations I had to deliver the meals to was the Intensive Mental Health Inpatient Unit. Many of the patients would enter from outside for dinner, and, while it may have not been the case for all of them, they seemed free to enter and leave the unit as they pleased.
Yet, there was a glass wall dividing the adjacent nurses’ office from the recreation room where patients would eat and a door that required a security card to pass through. Seeing this gave me the impression that some patients in this facility were dangerous, which stories from other orderlies corroborated. Though, trusting the security measures, I never felt unsafe, the fact that these measures were even in place often made me feel uncomfortable.
No one’s mental health is perfect, but when I visited this unit, I unintentionally drew a line in my mind that separated the mental health issues of people receiving clinical treatment from the rest of the population. I felt as though there was a clear distinction between me and them. The issues they faced were much more severe than my issues with stress and feelings of inadequacy, and not only did I feel these issues were incomparable, but that they existed on completely different scales.
Previously, feeling bad is something I’ve always felt guilty for, and in retrospect that has led to my past attempts at invalidating my issues. I was distinguishing between normal and abnormal mental health issues. I divided people who were facing common troubles and common symptoms, who were therefore “okay,” didn’t need support, and lacked a “valid” reason to feel bad; from people who were facing troubles and symptoms that the general population didn’t, who were “not okay” and needed medical attention.
Drawing these boundaries was harmful to people on both sides of the glass, including myself.
Back in 2019, I wanted to believe that, despite admitting the imperfectness of my mental health of myself and that of my friends, the issues we faced were not serious by virtue of their commonness. I wanted to believe that being behind that glass wall was what separated people who are fine from people with actual issues, and separated people with mental health problems from people suffering from mental illness.
It goes without saying that the difficulties those patients were experiencing were greater in magnitude than those that most people who admit to experiencing mental health issues might face. But I’ve come to think that one of the issues at the core of the stigma surrounding mental illness is when people believe in a division between the severity of a person’s mental health problems. This belief splits people up into “normal” and “abnormal,” and “sick” and “healthy” — a dichotomy that adversely affects everyone it categorizes.
This dichotomy perpetuates the idea that it is normal and common to have flawless mental health, or at least mental health sufficient enough to be of no concern and require no attention or support. It invalidates legitimate mental health issues by drawing a line between sick and healthy people, with no opportunity to be somewhere in between, which is where I think many if not most people would find themselves. It makes people feel as though, unless they have serious conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar or depressive disorders, their mental health must be adequate, and to seek help or even acknowledge the state of your mental wellbeing could be better would be overdramatic. It also forces you to discount that your mental health is imperfect in order to preserve the coveted “normality” that crossing that glass wall into “actual” mental illness would cause you to lose.
Believing this division exists contributes to the marginalization of people suffering from severe mental illnesses, suggesting that the difference between them and people without severe mental illnesses is black and white, rather than on a spectrum where the majority of people would fall in the gray. Seeing two fixed and opposing categorizations — with those struggling with mental illness on one end and the “healthy” general population on the other — can only isolate people with severe mental illnesses and generate a prejudicial attitude from people who consider themselves as their polar-opposite — and cause these people to look inwards with fear, discomfort, and ignorance from the other side of the glass.
Because we have such a wide variety of support systems available from Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services, I’m confident they don’t believe in this black-and-white contrast between people who are and aren’t mentally healthy. CAMHS recognizes issues such as Zoom fatigue and anxiety as valid problems that make your mental wellness less than perfect. You have the opportunity to occupy the gray area, rather than feeling you must be opposite to those who receive medical attention for their mental health.
But, on an individual basis, the belief in a glass wall that separates the sick and healthy persists.
Perhaps, as a world, and at institutions such as this university, if the majority of people stopped considering themselves to be completely different than the minority of people with recognized mental disorders, there would be a reduction in exclusionary behavior and an increase in the empathy that reducing this stigma so desperately requires. At the same time, dismantling this binary might convince the “okay” majority to not feel as though their mental health problems are insignificant, encouraging them to seek support.

Across the country, many people question whether or not their vote matters, and for good reason. With big corporations funneling hundreds of millions of dollars into elections, it sometimes feels like what transpires in our country is simply out of our control. However, the ability to vote is the one way we can give our input into what we want for our country’s future, and too few people are taking advantage of it.
The rising popularity of social media has seen the likes of Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook become hubs of political discussion, and the younger generations have made the most of this. Many social movements have been sparked online, and many have been educated about the world because of them. However, whenever those who desire change fight for an issue in this country, it seems like too often we don’t see it to the end. We protest, we march, and we educate, but that doesn’t seem to translate into actual legislation. The effort is there, but we cannot rely on politicians and large organizations to make change.
Protesting can’t be the end of the fight; it should be the very beginning. This energy has to continue all the way to the voting booth because the best way to make tangible reform is to change those who represent us and the laws that govern us.
The 2020 presidential election saw a record turnout, with 66.7 percent of the voter-eligible population participating, but local elections still don’t receive nearly as much attention. Nationwide, only 27 percent of eligible voters vote in the typical municipal election in 2018, even though these local governments control $2 trillion across the country. Additionally, these local elections aren’t truly representative of the actual population, with most voters who end up being white, richer, and older voters. If we truly want to see massive change across the country, we need to focus on maximizing our use of the rights we have.
That maximization requires actually voting. Many people care about the association with the aesthetic of caring about Black Lives Matter, voter suppression, and mass incarceration but aren’t invested in the actual issues themselves. To many, these issues are a way to gain social capital and look “woke” to those around them. A post on social media can be extremely powerful, but it means very little if people don’t express their beliefs through their vote. Especially in our generation, too many people are putting “#blm” in their Twitter bio while ignoring their local election day.
A good example of only caring about aesthetics is the movement to reform law enforcement. We can and must push loudly for police reform, but we must also remember that local governments control a lot of how the police operate. Your local police chief is likely decided by your mayor or another local governing body, and this plays a big role in how local police operate as a unit. If we focus on increasing voter turnout to elect a mayor and city council members that represent our views as a whole, the legislation that governs us will naturally begin to follow suit. Politicians listen to those who vote for them, and until we increase the representative population, many of these issues will remain.
Now, I don’t mean to attack those who don’t vote. Political parties have purposefully made it more difficult for certain groups of people to vote to benefit themselves, which has manifested itself in many different ways. Voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and felony disenfranchisement are genuine issues that hinder many from exercising their right to vote. Additionally, many local elections occur in odd-numbered, off-cycle years when much less focus is placed on elections in general. Thus, a lot of us feel like what we do doesn’t matter and don’t see the point in it, and this is understandable.
However, our hopelessness doesn’t have to continue. Research has shown many policies can be implemented to improve voter turnout. Automatic Voter Registration and preregistration have greatly increased voter turnout throughout the country in places they have been enacted. AVR broadly means that eligible citizens are automatically registered to vote when they get a driver's license or interact with other government agencies. Pre-registration involves having either 16 or 17-year-olds “pre-register” to vote, and when they reach voting age, they are automatically added to the voting rolls. Furthermore, moving the date of local elections to coincide with state or federal elections can also significantly raise turnout and save taxpayer money.
We need to cultivate a culture that shows people their vote matters at every level, and these policies would definitely help achieve that goal. No matter if it’s for the president or a city council member, every vote matters. Once we can collectively accept this reality, the country will truly improve.

As Cambridge’s innovation sector experiences rapid growth, a stark income gap has deepened for the city’s most vulnerable residents, according to a new report released earlier this month by the Cambridge Community Foundation.
The April 7 report compares Cambridge to 24 other “innovation cities,” such as San Francisco and Seattle, whose economies are primarily driven by the high-tech, biotech, engineering, and life sciences industries. While Cambridge leads the cities studied in a bevy of economic categories — including income growth, educational attainment, and innovation economy employment — the city also suffers from some of the starkest inequities, particularly among Black households. These inequities were exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“As this comparison makes clear, Cambridge today has taken its place among the nation’s innovation cities,” the report reads. “Beyond the statistics lies a loss of community cohesiveness, stability, and continuity as long-term populations are displaced by rising costs.”
Despite having the fourth-highest median household income among cities studied in the report — roughly $95,400 — Cambridge has the seventh-largest gap in household income. Comparing the highest and lowest quintiles, the wealthiest households earn an average of 25 times as much as the least wealthy households.
This disparity, according to the report, is most severe among Black households — 40 percent of Cambridge’s Black population is in the lowest income quintile, and 80 percent of Black households are renters rather than homeowners. The report notes that Black households are the most burdened by Cambridge’s rising housing costs, with nearly a third of Black homeowners and more than 55 percent of Black renters spending more than a third of their incomes on housing.
The researchers found that 22 percent of Cambridge residents are engaged in the innovation sector, and 81 percent of adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher — the most of any city in the study. However, just over one in three Black residents hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.
Cambridge Community Foundation President Geeta K. Pradhan, who directed the project, said in an interview that the foundation had been working on the report for three years, primarily focusing on gentrification, when the pandemic hit.
“The people who are hurting the most in a boom are also the people who are going to hurt the most when things are not going so well,” Pradhan said. “The report lifts up those inequities and raises concerns about what is happening in Cambridge.”
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui said in a conversation among local experts held the day of the report’s release — the first of several held by the foundation — that the city must ensure its economic growth benefits all residents.
“We must ensure that this growth and innovation does not further deepen the inequities that exist in Cambridge,” Siddiqui said. “We take this responsibility very seriously and have already begun the work across sectors to address the injustices the Equity and Innovation Report brings to light.”
Pradhan said the foundation plans to create a “civic agenda” for Cambridge to work toward greater equity following the report’s release, and will develop “robust partnerships” with local leaders and institutions.
“We are not beholden to anyone, we are independent,” Pradhan said. “We can bring together people from different sectors: from the innovation economy, from the community, from institutions, from government. We can bring people together to have this conversation about what should we be doing about these things.”
Concluding with a “call to action,” the report urges stakeholders in all of the city’s sectors to work together toward a more equitable Cambridge.
“As a community foundation, we see a Cambridge that is generous, concerned, and resourceful,” the report concludes. “We are relying on those altruistic impulses to guide us through the coming years to a more equitable future for all Cantabrigians.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow urged U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to “ease the return to campus” for international students by permanently increasing visa flexibility in a letter sent Monday.
Under a Trump administration rule, international students requiring F-1 sponsorship were unable to enter the U.S. if their courses were fully remote, leaving Harvard’s first-year international students scattered around the globe.
As consulates reopen and students prepare to return to in-person learning this fall, a backlog of scholars awaiting visas now foreshadows administrative delays.
In the letter, Bacow asked Tracy L. Renaud, acting director of USCIS, to “renew and extend the current flexibilities” to the Student Exchange Visitor Program in order to allow international students to obtain visas to attend schools that plan to continue limiting in-person learning.
“I hope you will consider, on a permanent basis, providing new flexibility for colleges and universities to offer international students opportunities to engage education programs that are low residency or hybrid, which would allow us to extend the reach of our programs to more students,” Bacow wrote.
He also called for the agency, which is housed within the Department of Homeland Security, to restore its “deference policy,” which previously allowed USCIS evaluators to defer to previous eligibility determinations while reviewing visa petitions.
The letter also urges USCIS to revise work authorization requirements to ensure the mandatory minimum wage reflects the salaries offered by colleges and universities, and to allow students to apply for work authorization earlier. Students currently must apply and gain authorization within 90 days of their start date — which Bacow claimed processing delays have made difficult to achieve.
Bacow’s letter was in response to a request for public comment issued by the Biden administration on how to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of federal immigration processes.
USCIS did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
Bacow, who publicly clashed with the Trump administration over immigration issues, wrote that executive actions by Trump “barred entry to many, with others beset by processing delays, backlogs, and administrative hurdles designed to frustrate access to opportunities in this country.”
“As a result, a shadow of uncertainty has been cast over immigrants and nonimmigrants alike—and it has taken a toll in higher education,” he added.
Bacow cited a recent report released by the Department of State and Institute of International Education that found last year marked the first “year-over-year decline” in the total enrollment of international students nationwide since 2005.
“Our present immigration system does not do nearly enough to encourage the legitimate flow of people and ideas or recognize the contributions that immigrants make to the US,” he wrote.
“The COVID pandemic has taught us that many of our most difficult challenges are global—and their solutions lie in international relationships and research collaborations that are established over time and enabled by flexible and accessible immigration policies,” Bacow added.

Researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences created a new method to transform the fundamental topology of cellular material, according to their paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature last week.
Senior authors Material Sciences professor Joanna Aizenberg and Applied Mechanics professor Katia Bertoldi, along with nine SEAS students and researchers, discovered a way to transform triangular cellular microstructures into hexagonal shapes, as well as circles to squares.
On microscopic scales, many materials are composed of lattice-like patterns that repeat across the material. For example, a block of ice contains naturally-repeating hexagonal arrangements — or geometric cells — of water molecules which make up the solid. SEAS researchers have developed a technique to modify the shape of similar structure patterns in some materials.
To alter the shape, the researchers exposed the triangular lattice to a solvent to soften the polymer, making it temporarily malleable so that its cellular shape could be changed.
As the liquid evaporated, its capillary forces allowed the microstructures to change shape. Capillary forces are the tendency of a liquid to slide through narrow spaces, much like how ink flows easily out of the nib of a fountain pen.
The team explored different applications of the method, including adding small patterns and designs into the microcellular structure by tweaking its geometry, as well as by transforming other lattices, including circular ones into squares. Researchers even used their method to imprint a microscopic Harvard shield into their transformed material.
The researchers also demonstrated the reversibility of the topological transformations by combining two liquids: one that swells the material and breaks the hexagons back into triangles, and another that delays capillary forces to allow the material to re-stiffen.
Bertoldi emphasized that, while she had previously worked on elongating the shapes of cellular microstructures, she had never actually worked to change their topology before.
“Here we were able to accomplish something that is extremely difficult to accomplish,” Bertoldi said. “Now, to be able to go from a triangle to a hexagon — that’s the remarkable part.”
Ph.D. student Shucong Li, a lead co-author on the study, said she appreciates the simplicity of the project’s components — that anyone can do it with “no training required.”
“I like how simple the method is — how simple your operation is required to be, but how complex the outcome is,” she said. “You have a structure and you use a pipette to add a droplet of liquid. That’s all the things you need to do.”
Fellow lead co-author Bolei Deng — a fifth-year Ph.D. student who works in Bertoldi’s lab — suggested the idea for the project after coming across a video clip, according to Bertoldi.
Like Li, Deng emphasized the relatively common nature of liquid used to induce such a fundamental change in cellular structure.
“There’s nothing special about the liquid,” Deng said. “We’re not using a magical liquid — just some common liquid.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Justin Y. Tseng ’22 approaches his senior year, he is embarking on a job search that looks quite different from that of a typical rising senior. In late March, he announced his run for Medford City Council with the goal of serving the town he calls home.
As a young candidate with a progressive vision, he said he hopes to address issues such as school funding and housing affordability, as well as serve as the first elected City Council member of color in decades.
Tseng, a first-generation Taiwanese American, moved to Medford from Iowa when he was two years old and, since then, has grown up there and attended Medford Public Schools.
“I’ve always felt connected to my community,” Tseng said. “[When you’re] a child of immigrants, when you find that community that really embraces you, you really want to give back to it.”
Tseng said he found ways to give back through volunteering at his elementary school’s after-school program, assisting his middle school orchestra teacher in giving cello lessons, and representing students on his elected school committee.
Since attending Harvard, Tseng said he has continued to stay involved with Medford — a Boston suburb home to just under 60,000 residents — by facilitating conversations about rethinking Medford’s school budget between the teachers’ union and members of the School Committee.
Through his work and activism as a student, he met current Medford City Councilor Isaac B. “Zac” Bears, who recently endorsed Tseng.
“I’m all in for Justin,” Bears said. “He’s a kind person, attentive, paying attention to the issues, reaching out to folks who may not feel represented by city government currently, so that’s one reason that I really support him.”
Tseng said he is advertising himself as a progressive candidate who would bring racial diversity and experience working with Medford Public Schools to the City Council.
According to Bears, both of these factors are particularly important right now, given that Medford currently faces challenges with school funding and lacks racial diversity on its city council.
Tseng said he is optimistic that Medford voters will want candidates who promote progress.
“Medford is at the crossroads of change,” Tseng said. “When you look at the discussions that my city is having from how we deal with consequences of the pandemic to the national movement for Black lives, I think that people in Medford are ready to stand up and meet the moment.”
It is no secret that Tseng is significantly younger than most of the current City Council members.
According to Bears, who is the youngest current member of the Council, this is actually a strength for Tseng, given that the average age of the Council members is significantly higher than that of their constituents.
James A. Fitz-Henley ’22, Tseng’s roommate, said he believes Tseng’s age does not diminish his desire and qualifications to serve the city.
“Yes, Justin is young, but I also think he’s a very wise and thoughtful person. I think he’s willing to listen and excited to listen to lots of different perspectives,” Fitz-Henley said.
“I have a hard time believing that there’s anybody who is more passionate about Medford than Justin is, and I’m fully confident that he is competent and capable of doing some really great things for the city,” he added.
At Harvard, Tseng is a member of the Institute of Politics, where he served as chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project and co-chaired the Education Policy group. He also plays cello for the Bach Society Orchestra.
Despite his active political involvement both in Medford and at Harvard, Tseng said he has no clear aspiration to be a career politician or necessarily run for public office at all outside of the City Council.
“I think the question I will always be asking myself is what the best way to serve is. And so, right now for me, I believe that’s being a city councilor in the city that I grew up in, the city that I love,” Tseng said.
“I’ve been very passionate about Medford for a very long time,” he added. “But there’s a lot of people [who] do pursue politics as a career for a very, very long time and, you know, if that’s the best way for me to serve my community and for me to serve this world, then I’ll do that, but if there are other opportunities and other ways that I can give back, then I’ll also consider all of those.”
The preliminary election for Medford City Council will take place on Sept. 14, followed by the regular election on Nov. 2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
First Amendment legal scholars convened to discuss the complexities of supporting freedom of speech and fostering an atmosphere of inclusion and belonging in academia during a Tuesday webinar.
Co-hosted by the Office for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging and the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, the panel featured University of California, Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky and American Civil Liberties Union attorney Emerson Sykes. Harvard Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston and Edmond J. Safra Center fellow Sigal R. Ben-Porath moderated the discussion.
Charleston began the dialogue by asking about the boundaries of free speech rights in conversations related to controversial political issues.
“One of the things that we’re grappling with on college campuses generally is, how do we strike a balance between promoting free speech and protecting students, protecting minority viewpoints, in the context of the sort of broader moments that we find ourselves in when things can be very controversial?” Charleston said.
Chemerinsky argued for the importance of protecting the freedom of speech, even speech that is viewed unfavorably.
“I’ve often said that the only way that my speech or your speech can be protected tomorrow is to safeguard the speech we don’t like today,” Chemerinsky said.
“We naturally will allow the speech that we like to go forward. We need the First Amendment for the speech that we detest, because there’s going to be a point where there is going to be those who detest our speech, want to silence us too,” he added.
Sykes described instances of professors using offensive language in the classroom and how universities should consider handling these situations.
“I often say between doing nothing and firing someone are all of the good ideas for how you can respond. And so I try to encourage both students and faculty to think creatively about how we repair harm and repair communities,” Sykes said.
He added that creating a relationship of trust between student activists and universities will allow institutions to deal with instances of problematic speech.
“If you’re in a place where you feel safe and welcome, and you have a strong community, you’re less likely to be really thrown off by one incident,” Sykes explained.
Chemerinsky said he believes “all ideas and views” — aside from speech that evokes violence — can be presented on college campuses and added that administrators should work to foster an “inclusive” environment.
“At the campus level, I think that all ideas and views can be expressed, even offensive ideas and views. But that doesn’t mean that the campus is powerless to make an inclusive community,” he said. “And I think we have to focus on what are the things as campus administrators we should be doing in light of speech that, at times, is offensive, can be racist, sexist, homophobic?”
Chemerinsky said those in campus leadership should use instances of offensive speech as an opportunity to establish and reaffirm the institution’s principles, help organize counter-demonstrations, and take “affirmative steps” to promote inclusion.
“We have to denounce hate speech when it occurs, we have to provide forums for counter-speech, we have to find ways of empowering our students of color, students from marginalized communities,” Chemerinsky explained.
“I think our challenge is to make sure that when the hate speech goes out, it doesn’t drown out all of the other things,” he added. “We want to make sure all those other things are really what becomes most salient on campus.”
In an interview following the panel, Charleston said she believes “vigorous debate” with opposing ideals begets truth.
“We do fundamentally believe that by allowing for vigorous debate, that we arrive at really the ultimate goal, which is truth,” Charleston said. “That’s where we can oftentimes challenge ideas that we might even find repugnant personally, because certainly speech that is restricted today may turn into speech, that is, in fact, ours that is then restricted tomorrow.”
Ben-Porath said in an interview after the event that interpretations of freedom of speech are continually shifting.
“I think that American society’s perspectives on freedom of speech are evolving. Right now, they are undergoing a generational change and I think it’s going to end up to be significantly to the better,” Ben-Porath said.

On June 9, 2020, fourth-year School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Ph.D. candidate Yuntian Deng came across a tweet from former president Donald Trump showing a Fox News report indicating that “Wuhan showed signs of virus last August,” attributed to a Harvard study.
Sensing that this tweet could have a “really big social impact,” Deng immediately looked online for the original paper to better understand the evidence posed to support the reported findings.
What Deng found was a yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study that had been made available on Harvard DASH, an open-access repository for scholarly work by Harvard affiliates.
The research article, titled “Analysis of hospital traffic and search engine data in Wuhan China indicates early disease activity in the Fall of 2019,” supported a hypothesis that the novel coronavirus emerged in Wuhan earlier than the documented start of the pandemic in December 2019.
Conducted by researchers at Harvard Medical School, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Boston University, the study examined satellite images of six hospital parking lots in Wuhan as well as search word data from the Baidu index, a Chinese data sharing platform analyzing online user activity. The paper cited an “upward trend” in hospital traffic and search volume for diarrhea — a Covid-related symptom — beginning in the fall 2019.
Upon closer examination of the research article, Deng and fellow SEAS graduate student Shijian “Martin” Jin found what they believed to be multiple flaws in the presentation and methods of the study.
Deng and Jin presented these concerns in an open letter dated June 15, 2020 — signed by over 60 Harvard graduate students and alumni — to the HMS administration and the study’s corresponding author, John Brownstein, an HMS professor and chief innovation officer of Boston Children’s Hospital.
Specifically, the students cited inconsistent usages of language throughout the paper and the possible use of data dredging — a technique in which statistical tests can be run multiple times to eventually reach a desired conclusion.
After receiving no response from HMS for nearly a month, Deng and Jin met with Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean for Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas and sent a follow-up email on July 14. HMS Chief of Staff Jennifer M. Ryan responded to their letter later that day, promising an institutional review of the research article, according to emails reviewed by The Crimson.
After six months of silence, Deng wrote an email on Jan. 25, 2021 asking for investigation updates. He sent another follow-up email on March 18, 2021, nearly nine months after HMS’s last correspondence.
After looping in the Harvard and SEAS diversity offices in a separate email thread on the same March day reiterating the posed concerns, Deng received a response on April 1 from Boston Children’s Hospital vice president of research administration August “Gus” Cervini and HMS Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity Gretchen Brodnicki, which conveyed that a review by Boston Children’s Hospital found “no concerns” with the research article under its institutional policies, according to the emails reviewed by The Crimson.
In response to what he characterized as an “unsatisfying” investigation result, Deng replied asking for more details about the review process regarding decision-making protocols, specific evidence that supported the review’s result, and the diversity of the investigation committee — to which he received no reply.
Spokespeople for HMS and BCH confirmed in a statement an investigation of the article occurred, but did not provide specific details regarding the review.
Since becoming available to the general public, the article has garnered widespread media attention.
In June, The Crimson reported on the study’s preliminary findings suggesting the early emergence of Covid-19 in Wuhan late August.
ABC News prematurely published a report on the study a few hours prior to the article’s actual release due to a server issue with Harvard DASH on June 8, according to an emailed statement from Brownstein.
The paper was also picked up by Chinese media, after which the article became a widely circulated topic of conversation among Chinese social media users.
“Everyone was talking about it,” said Hao Chen, a Chinese national and post-doctoral researcher at the Institute for Numerical and Applied Mathematics at the University of Göttingen in Germany. “It was very controversial in China.”
Chen, along with four researchers from Harvard, University of Virginia, Zhejiang University, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, began compiling a comment paper to identify and explicate their concerns over the study. Chen said the purpose behind publishing this paper was to “leave a record in the academic literature.”
The comment paper was also published on Harvard DASH on July 8, 2020 — exactly a month after the original study became available on the same repository.
Their comments added to the voices of many other experts’ on the limitations of the study, including what Deng and Jin outlined in their open letter.
Deng and Jin’s open letter, as well as Chen and his team’s comment paper, specifically pointed to shortcomings in the study’s use of Baidu search engine data.
The original study found that, similar to how elevation of searches for the keyword “cough” coincides with the yearly influenza season, the search trend for the keyword “diarrhea” — which the study defined as “a more COVID-19 specific symptom,” — was elevated since August 2019.
Both native Mandarin speakers themselves, Deng and Jin noted the authors used a Mandarin phrase that translates to “symptoms of diarrhea,” rather than the much more common translation of the word “diarrhea.”
“The search term they used was not really Chinese language. That sounds very strange to Chinese ear,” Chen said.
After reproducing the search engine test using the more common Mandarin translation of “diarrhea,” Deng and Jin said their results did not match those of the authors.
“All search terms were vetted by a native Mandarin speaker on our study team,” Brownstein wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson. “The search term we chose for “diarrhea” (腹泻的症状) was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of COVID-19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus by the Baidu search engine’s 需求图谱 (Demand Map) tool.”
Donald A. “Don” Goldmann ’65, a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and HMS, questioned the focus of the study on search trends of “diarrhea” due to its lack of uniqueness to Covid-19.
“Diarrhea is not unique at all. It’s a very common symptom,” Goldmann said. “For all I knew there was a national outbreak of some viral diarrhea at that time — who knows?”
In fact, Chen and his team also attempted to reproduce the original search engine test, but found that the elevated trend in search queries appeared “nationwide,” not only in Wuhan. Chen added that the elevated search trend “doesn’t appear in other search terms” that are more typical symptoms of Covid-19, including shortness of breath, coughing, or fever.
Goldmann also said the original study could have included mention of the other Covid-19 symptoms and search trends they analyzed, even if the analysis didn’t show significant trends.
Responding to this, Brownstein argued that the Baidu index lacked data on the proper keywords for other coronavirus symptoms.
“Many other words for COVID-19 unique symptoms such as loss of taste or smell were not recorded by the Baidu index prior to May 2020,” he wrote.
Deng and Jin, as well as Chen’s team, also suggested the potential that the study misinterpreted the statistical data taken from the Baidu search queries. According to Chen, Brownstein’s team used a statistical method to smooth the data — reducing statistical noise in order to better visualize the trends.
“They are definitely manipulating the data, but manipulating is not falsifying the data,” Chen said. “So the data is true, but the way they analyze the data is problematic.”
Brownstein argued that his team used the smoothing method to “highlight local trends in the data,” and still included each discrete data point on the figures to be “as transparent as possible.”
The study’s usage of satellite data of six Wuhan hospital parking lots also prompted concerns.
Deng and Jin questioned the selection criteria for the six Wuhan hospitals — one of which was a women and children’s hospital — in analyzing the emergence of the virus.
Chen argued this hospital was “not a logical choice” in selecting for patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, given that this hospital does not have a “fever clinic.”
Several experts said in interviews they found the use of hospital images as evidence unconvincing.
“I thought it was an interesting idea to use the satellite imagery to try and come up with inferences about disease from hospital car parks,” said Paul Digard, a professor of virology at the University of Edinburgh. “But when I read it, I thought it was underpowered for the implications.”
“The parking lot data is interesting,” added Goldmann, the BCH pediatrician. “But then you have to ask yourself, are all those people really flocking to the hospital because they have symptoms of Covid?”
Brownstein acknowledged in his emailed statement that having additional control cities would have increased the robustness of the study. He noted, however, that a significant amount of cloudy weather during November 2019 to February 2020 in Wuhan created limitations in high quality satellite images that could be analyzed.
“We presented results for all the hospitals that we had enough data points on, and sensitivity analyses show the overall trends are robust,” he wrote. “Of note, the exclusion of any single hospital -- including Wuhan Women and Children’s -- did not change the results of our findings.”
In addition to its methods, critics pointed to concerns regarding the potential social implications of the study, arguing it may spur hatred against China and Chinese people, and that this possibility was exacerbated by wide media circulation of the study’s conclusions under the Harvard brand.
“The inconclusive or unscientific statement in the title and abstract has been cited as a fact and used to vilify China, provoking hatred against Chinese, especially Chinese students in the US,” Deng and Jin wrote in their open letter last June. “This not only hurts the feeling of Chinese students at Harvard, but also denigrates Harvard’s reputation as an institution that is known for her research integrity.”
“As members of the Harvard community, we were very concerned to see such a misleading paper affiliated with Harvard. We respect scientific investigations and understand that some hard truths might be disturbing, but to the best of our judgment, this article is misleading to the public,” they added.
Deng and Jin noted that while the paper’s title indicated that the findings supported the hypothesis of early disease activity in Wuhan, the conclusion states that the retrospective analysis “cannot verify” the data’s connection to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
When asked about the potential social implications of the study, Brownstein wrote that he and his research team are “very concerned” about the stigmatization and bias that comes from research that associates a country with a virus.
“Our team has been actively working on early identification of disease outbreaks for two decades. We’ve published similar methods around early insights on H1N1 in Mexico, Zika in South America and foodborne outbreaks in the US,” he wrote. “Our longstanding work to identify the origins of disease emergence is core to our team’s efforts to inform and improve global health surveillance.
“Our work is guided purely by science and nothing else,” he added.
The preliminary data was presented in a seminar at the Harvard Department of Biomedical Informatics, according to Brownstein. But after some of the co-authors were subject to “significant personal attacks on social media,” Brownstein said he and his team decided to “hold back” any further presentations or publications until after the peer-review process.
Brownstein added that the paper has now been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication, accounting for changes based on numerous suggestive comments they received.
Citing HMS and Boston Children’s Hospital’s “lack of transparency” with the review process, Deng and Jin demanded a full disclosure of the investigation protocols involved in the article’s review in their April 1 response to the administrators.
“I am happy to accept that we are wrong in our arguments,” Deng said. “But I think at least they need to refute our concerns in our original email point by point.”
Deng added that he believed HMS failed to address student concerns surrounding ethical considerations and potential social impacts of the paper, particularly during a spike in anti-Asian violence.
“Please please please take this and the two thousand Chinese students/scholars at Harvard seriously,” Deng and Jin wrote in the April 1 email. “Please prove your care for Asian community with action, not words.”

The ever-approaching finals season may have you watching lectures at double speed, contemplating life in the shower, or truly just wishing for some ~authentic~ Harvard experiences. For those of us who are still stuck off campus, fret not. As you push towards the end of what is *hopefully* your last remote semester, here are some tips to make campus seem a little less distant.
Making yourself HUDS dishes
Although home-cooked meals can never grow old, there is something special about the collaborative dining food experience that you may miss. An easy way to solve this would be recreating your favorite HUDS dishes at home. Start by obtaining a tray or brown paper bag and creating a line with your family members around the house. This can trigger the familiar sensation of walking through the dining hall or the FlyBy (no, the other one) line. After enjoying your top HUDS meal (caesar salad always slaps), find a random rack in your house to simulate the dish return area. Your parents may not like this, but it’s worth it.
Wearing Harvard merch 24/7
What better way to recreate the Harvard experience than constantly reminding yourself and the people around you of it? Start by finding and investing in your top Harvard merch. At home the options are endless: Harvard shirts, sweaters, sweats, socks, pajamas, and even underwear. Somehow, the COOP doesn’t sell face masks, so make sure you get that buy that oh-so-subtle Harvard facemask from some third-party vendor so that everyone knows you go to “a small liberal arts college in Boston.”
The Perks
Remember those Harvard perks when searching for snacks? Try pretending your $65 of Boardplus still exists at your local supermarket. The cashier may be confused, but it’s on Harvard’s dime, right? Another favorite classic memory you can recreate at home is “Brain Break.” Don’t forget to buy your favorite off-brand cereals like “Cinnamon Toasters,” “Marshmallow Mateys,” “Fruit Rounds,” and “Cocoa Peanut Butter Spheres.” These delicious breakfast snacks combined with any assortment of random leftovers in your fridge at 12 a.m. will immediately transport you back into your house dining hall.
Hahvahd’s Traditions
You may have the food and the fits down, but one thing that really makes Harvard are the unique and confusing traditions we have. Start simple by referring to your parents and siblings as your “blockmates.” If you’re feeling ambitious, don’t forget to streak through your neighborhood *with a mask* before finals. This special Harvard tradition may not always be socially acceptable, but it is definitely doable, as long as you’re willing to shed your dignity along with your clothes. Just be careful if you pee on your neighbor’s lawn — but then again, if the dog can do it, so can you (note: Flyby does not endorse public urination).
Follow these steps, and who knows! Maybe you’ll be featured on Dean Khurana’s Instagram ;) All in all, we miss Harvard and Harvard life, but hopefully these little tips can make you smile or at least contemplate the decisions you make on campus.

When you arrive at Harvard, you might be unaware of the distinct phrases students say that have a different meaning than their literal definitions. It is a learned language that one has to assimilate to; however, once you get the hang of it, you never forget it. Webster—I mean—Flyby has your definitions ready!
Harvard student: Omg! We have to grab lunch/coffee/dinner/boba [insert another meal or edible treat] one day!
Translation: I know we’re acquaintances but I’d really like this interaction to end. We will never follow up on this proposition.
---
Harvard student: Omg I was studying so late last night. I only got five hours of sleep.
Other student: Omg, I only got two!
Translation: I want to seem busier than you.
---
Harvard student: My family’s not rich, but I’d say we’re comfortable.
Translation: I’m freaking loaded!
---
Harvard Student: I’m from 30 minutes outside of New York City!
Translation: I’m from Connecticut!
---
Harvard Student: To jump off of [student in class]’s point…..
Translation: I didn’t do the readings, but I need participation points.
As the semester comes to a close, I am excited to have a break from Harvard language over the summer. However, these unspoken meanings of communication are one of many factors that bring the student body together, and I’m sure I’ll end up missing these slightly annoying Harvard-isms in a few weeks! <3
