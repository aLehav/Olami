After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From Coca-Cola to the literary genre of Southern Gothic, the South has laid some of the most important bricks in America’s cultural foundation. But possibly the most important—at the least, the most widespread—product of the lower states is their music. Even in a modern musical world of mixing forms and aesthetics, the sounds of Dixie are unmistakable, and on their self-titled debut album, the Lone Bellow bring all these sounds together into an irrefutably “Southern” release.
While the group officially formed in Brooklyn, the band’s core trio all grew up in small Southern towns. They’ve been lumped in with the current wave of acoustic suspender-snappers like Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers, but the Lone Bellow’s awareness of the genre’s breadth sets them apart from the rest. These three songsters are equally comfortable with country twang as with roaring gospel, and the album showcases their versatility while retaining a sense of intimacy. While it meanders in places—the band’s sound is not yet focused—the album is a promising debut, an array of songs that fit together as heartfelt chronicles of the trials and thrills of romance.
 
Even within one song, primary songwriter and vocalist Zach Williams is able to encapsulate a wide spectrum of emotion. The anthemic “You Never Need Nobody,” a waltzing power ballad, stays soulful as it alternates between pleading, praising, and scorning a loved one. It is a successful exercise in genre-blending, with gentle acoustic strumming and glistening steel guitar highlights that give way to a faux-gospel shout at the top of the rousing chorus. Williams and his fellow vocalists, Brian Elmquist and Kanene Pipkin, have much to show for their two years of close collaboration; even while belting full-bore, they are perfectly synced on every inflection.
 
When the subject matter is brighter, Williams’ lyrical style remains substantive, walking the thin line between storytelling and poetry. On "Green Eyes and a Heart of Gold," the exuberant opener, Williams pairs the sparely realistic “All our money’s gone and the house is cold / And it's alright,” with the abstract “We're losing blood with every beat / Our song is not a dying dream,” simultaneously telling the story and capturing the feelings of two people whose mutual love is all they need to build their lives.
 
From the beginning, though, the album is not without its lapses into mundanity. For most of “Green Eyes and a Heart of Gold,” the marching snare drum keeps things bouncing alongside sustained power chords and sprinkles of mandolin. But everything collapses when the guitar solo kicks in; the drums fall into a vapid rock beat, and the ebullience that has been building is lost to overpowering guitar fuzz. The moment is brief, but jarring—even some of the album’s more successful songs tend to take drab left turns. 
 
These unwelcome detours emerge on a larger scale, too. On “Bleeding Out,” the trio's explosive vocals—usually a strong suit—are just one of many elements cranked up to excess. The track abandons the group’s rural blend of acoustic guitar, mandolin, and violin for the sounds of soft rock radio, with layers of electric guitar that in this context become extraneous noise. The highlights of the album are lyrically and musically intimate—the wavering acoustic texture that predominates matches the sensitivity of the album’s themes—and by comparison, “Bleeding Out” rings hollow. The lyrics, too, are lofty and hard to grasp—with lines like the cryptic “Breathing in, breathing out, it’s all in my mouth / Gives me hope that I’ll be something worth bleeding out,” the trio seems uncomfortable dealing in abstractions, especially in contrast to the album’s more successful songs of personal dramas.
 
The only truly effective departure from comfortable territory is the album's closer, a lazy swinger called “Button” that features a sultry Pipkin and a horn section unafraid to jazz things up. The rest of the album could have benefited from more daring asides like “Button,” but the Lone Bellow do enough already to push likely fans to the edges of their comfort zones. Indeed, those seeking the next Fleet Foxes—or conversely, the heirs to Hank Williams—might be disappointed. The album is a smorgasbord of Southern comfort from an omnivorous band, and only fans with broad palettes will eat it up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a big win over No. 4 Trinity the night before, the No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team (11-1, 5-1 Ivy) picked up another win against a top-tier opponent. The Crimson took down No. 9 Brown (11-6, 1-5 Ivy) in a Thursday night contest at Brodsky Memorial Squash Pavilion.
“We were really excited [about the win],” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “After coming off [the win against] Trinity, we were kind of on a high. We have just been keeping that momentum going.”
The match was originally set for Friday but was moved up a day early due to inclement weather. The schedule meant that Harvard played matches on back-to-back nights, but fatigue seemed to be a non-factor in the Crimson’s 9-0 routing of the Bears.
“Physically, we are a little run down, and mentally, you [have] to keep the fire going,” Kingshott said. “The season is really long. It’s back loaded with our Ivy matches now but we’ve been playing since September and have had matches since November. We want to stay focused.”
It was back to business as usual for sophomore Amanda Sobhy, who won her match 3-0. The sophomore entered Thursday’s contest coming of a match in which she dropped the first game of her collegiate career to Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy.
“Trying to stay undefeated and 3-0, I definitely put a little more pressure on myself in the match against Trinity,” Sobhy said. “But after I lost the first game, I realized you can’t always have a perfect streak. Going into Brown, there was no need to be nervous or put any extra pressure on myself.”
Sobhy had little trouble taking down Dori Rahbar of the Bears. Playing in the No. 1 spot, the reigning national champion had the most dominating performance of the night, dishing out 11-1, 11-2, 11-5 wins to move to 5-0 on the year.
“She’s just a top class competitor,” Kingshott said. “She handles both her wins and losses in the game with grace. I think she’s in a great place, mentally and physically.”
Senior Laura Gemmell picked up another convincing win in the No. 2 position. Gemmell took down Brown’s Mina Shakarashy, 3-0, with 11-5, 11-4, 11-5 victories. With the win, the senior is now 9-0 on the season.
Kingshott picked up her tenth win of the season by posting another 3-0 victory in the No. 5 slot with 11-3, 11-8, 11-5 wins over Isabel Pitaro. Classmate Eliza Calihan, playing in the No. 9 position, recorded the only game loss for Harvard on the night. But Calihan still rolled to a 3-1 victory after going 11-5, 2-11, 11-9, 11-6.
Playing in the No. 3 spot, sophomore Haley Mendez handled her opponent with 11-4, 11-8, and 11-6 wins to pick up another point for the Crimson. Classmate Julianne Chu, who was out due to injury for much of the season’s earlier matches, remained undefeated on the year with a 11-5, 11-7, 11-3 victory in the No. 6 slot. Sophomore Megan Murray also picked up a win for the Crimson, topping her opponent 11-9, 11-7, 11-7 in the No. 7 slot.
First years Saumya Karki and Isabelle Dowling rounded out the matches in the top nine. Karki had an easy time at No. 4, boasting 11-3, 11-7, 11-4 wins, while classmate Dowling had a similarly took care of business in the No. 8 slot, posting a convincing 11-7, 11-7, 11-5 victory.
“We played really solidly,” Sobhy said. “Everyone pretty much came out there to play. We wasted little time and did our best.”
Coming off back-to-back wins at the end of the week, Harvard will have little time to rest. The team will hit the courts on Sunday afternoon for its regular season finale against Yale. The contest will be a rematch of last year’s CSA Team Final, in which the Crimson rolled to an 8-1 victory to take the national title.
“It’s Harvard-Yale,” Kingshott said. “It’s always an exciting, fun match to play. They’re great opponents. It’s competitive. It’s really great to have the home court advantage.”
The Crimson’s strong play of late against top-ranked opponents bodes well for Harvard as it looks down the line towards the CSA Team Championships, to be held next weekend in New Haven.
“We all realize how important the end of the season is,” Kingshott said. “Staying mentally up for these matches is relatively easy. We’re excited to finally be here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 30 minutes of dominant play at Newman Arena, it seemed that the Harvard men’s basketball team could finally take a breath.
But once again, last minute inconsistency almost handed the Crimson its first Ivy League loss as its lead began to slip away down the stretch. Although Harvard (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) pulled out a 67-65 win over Cornell (10-12, 2-3), the game came down to a deep missed shot at the buzzer that would have put the Big Red on top.
With Harvard up by 20 midway though the second half, two straight turnovers and a Jonah Travis foul handed the Big Red the momentum, and Cornell held Harvard to only one score in the next four minutes.
The Crimson fought back and built its lead back up to 15 but found itself shut out as time wound down. With 4:21 on the clock, co-captain and guard Christian Webster scored Harvard’s final points of the night, and from then on it was all Big Red.
“We stopped working to get the ball,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Whether that’s fatigue or whatever it is, we didn’t work to get open… They turned up the pressure and since then we were a little tentative.”
As Harvard struggled to find the bottom of the net, Cornell—which shot 49 percent from the field on the night—made clutch baskets down the stretch. The Big Red scored on its next five possessions and pulled within two before time ran out.
The Crimson was its own worst enemy down the stretch, committing seven turnovers in the last ten minutes and continuing its trend of playing into close games against Ivy League opponents. Of the five conference games Harvard has played this season, two have gone into overtime—most recently against Brown, when the Crimson blew a 22-point lead at Lavietes Pavilion last weekend.
“It’s been something that’s happened to us, being a very young team,” Amaker said. “We came out [strong] at the beginning of the second half, and I thought we were growing up right there, but we reverted back.”
THREE FOR ALL
After posting a season-high 16 points against the Bears last weekend, Webster topped his record by one, sinking five threes and adding two points from the paint.
Webster continued to show consistency from behind the arc when it mattered most, hitting back-to-back treys in the closing minutes of the second frame. The senior’s last minute heroics, which fueled Harvard’s comeback against Dartmouth in the team’s home opener, once again proved to be a deciding factor in the Crimson’s victory.
Shooting 46 percent from behind the arc, Webster notched a new season high with the five treys and continued to solidify his reputation as one of Harvard’s strongest shooters.
As Webster has heated up from behind the arc, the Crimson has relied less on its traditionally strong three point shooters—freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and junior co-captain and guard Laurent Rivard.
Rivard—who leads the team with 2.8 made threes per game—went 1-for-3 from deep on Friday, while Chambers accounted for two of the team’s 10 threes. When asked if the shifting roles on the team were by design, Amaker explained that scouting is a large factor.
“You can imagine how people are going to try to guard against Siyani and Laurent, so it’s going to be other guys who are going to be open for us,” Amaker said.
PECKING ORDER
Coming into the second half, Cornell looked like a different team. In the opening period, the Big Red had just two scorers break five points—senior guard Johnathan Gray and freshman guard Nolan Cressler off the bench.
With two points and 13 minutes of play at halftime, forward Errick Peck looked like a non-issue for Harvard.
Less than three minutes into the second half, the senior hit a jump shot and never slowed down, notching 15 points before the final buzzer. Peck’s 17 points were a game high for Cornell and came mostly in the paint with only one three-pointer. The forward went 2 for 2 from the line.
Peck carried the Big Red in the final minute of the game, grabbing an offensive board and hitting the jump shot that pulled Cornell within two. After Chambers missed the front end of a one-and-one on the other end, Peck rebounded the ball and gave the Big Red possession with 11 seconds to play.
But the senior’s efforts would be in vain, as—with Cornell’s potential comeback riding on his shoulders—he missed the final shot of the game.
“They did a great job,” Amaker said. “You have to give them a whole lot of credit for how their kids played and how much fight they brought to the last few minutes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its past success and talent on the roster, it’s not all that surprising when Harvard’s men’s squash steps up and performs outstandingly.
Still, the No.3 Crimson continues to impress, as it rolled over No. 17 Brown in a 9-0 win in which all the Harvard players blanked their foes 3-0. The lopsided victory is Harvard’s fourth time sweeping its opponent in all nine matches this season.
The Crimson (14-1, 5-1 Ivy), which met the Bears (7-9, 0-6 Ivy) on Thursday night at the Kate Brodsky Memorial Squash Pavilion in Providence, was playing in one of its last conference matchups of the year, with only rivals Yale left on the  regular season schedule.
“We won in total 27 games and didn’t drop any,” junior Ali Farag said, “which is just a huge win for the team. I know that looking at our two teams we were the stronger team on paper, but no one cashed it in and everyone played really hard and competed to get the win.”
The match was moved up to Thursday from Friday due to the snowstorm anticipated to rock the Northeast.
Three players from the Crimson squad reached 10 wins on the season. Junior Brandon McLaughlin was the fastest to the benchmark, and teammate Sam Goldberg and Tommy Mullaney soon followed suit.
Goldberg has shined as one of a handful of freshmen to see extended playing time in the varsity lineup. Playing at the eighth position, he beat out Charles Lebovitz, 11-3, 11-5, 11-8, to become the first freshman to reach ten wins.
“It feels good [getting ten wins],” Goldberg said. “It’s great to help out the team. I don’t care much about my personal record, what’s more important is that we’re all striving for the same goal and that I can contribute to the team.”
McLaughlin, playing second singles, got there first after winning one of the more lopsided matches of the day against Oliver Booth, 11-3, 11-1, 11-3. Mullaney was the third player to hit 10, with a straight-game win in the six slot, 11-3, 11-4, 11-3, over Michael Snower.
Farag and co-captain Jason Michas are both undefeated at 9-0 on the season. Farag, who has played at number one for most of the year and is the defending national champion, defeated Blake Reinson, 11-9, 11-8, 13-11, in one of the closer matches of the day to keep his unbeaten streak alive.  Michas won a hard-fought second game and cruised through a third to win against the Bears’ Michael Snower, 11-3, 13-11, 11-3.
“It wasn’t our hardest match of the season,” Farag said, “but they still played very well and we had some hard matchups. But in the end we prepared well for them and we were ready for what they had in store.”
Junior Nigel Koh, playing at the third position, cruised through the first two games before winning a hard-fought decider to beat out Brown’s Eamon O’Connor, 11-3, 11-4, 12-10. At the fifth spot co-captain Zeke Scherl defeated Christopher Holter 11-2, 11-6, 11-8.
The team is looking forward towards its matchup next weekend against Yale, the last Ivy League match-play of the season. With national play still on the horizon, Harvard has the chance to grab a share of the Ivy title with a win against the Bulldogs.
“Our co-captains [Scherl and Michas] came out in the huddle and told us to use this match as a tune-up and confidence-booster for Yale next weekend,” Goldberg said. “And we’re ready, you know. We’re ready for our next big challenge, which is going to be going up against our rivals this Sunday.”
Farag echoed his teammate’s words.
“The only match we lost this season in Ivy League play was against the Tigers,” Farag said. “But now we have the chance to come back and take a share of the Ivy League title. So we’re going into next weekend with this in mind; that we’re coming out to play for a piece of the Ivy League title.”
The rest of the Harvard squad held up their end of the bargain, with players all pulling through for straight-set wins.
Walker Evans, the other freshman in the lineup on the day, played at the ninth spot and won out against his opponent, Alexander Hsu, 11-7, 11-4, 11-7. Alexander Ma, playing at seven, defeated his opponent in a shootout despite fierce competition from Brown’s Tod Holberton. Every game came fairly close, but Ma was able to hold off Holberton to win 11-9, 11-7, 11-8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team had been there before.
Just as it did in the waning minutes of its Ivy League contest against Dartmouth, the Crimson found itself down by double digits to an underdog opponent—this time Columbia—as the clock wound down in the second half. And just like in each of its four most recent league contests, Harvard was once again in need of late-game heroics.
But this time, down 20 with 2:58 to go, a storybook comeback wasn’t in the cards.
“We were certainly out of sync,” Amaker said. “We’ll take a look at the film and see where we went wrong. There were a lot of breakdowns in communication, and they took advantage of those.”
Led by sophomore Wesley Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, who each scored four points in the final 3:09, Harvard tallied seven straight points to cut Columbia’s lead to 75-62 with just under two minutes to play.
But it was too little, too late, as the Crimson (13-7, 5-1 Ivy) eventually suffered its first league defeat of the 2012-13 campaign, 78-63, at the hands of the Lions (10-10, 2-4) Sunday afternoon at Levien Gymnasium.
“You’re never comfortable on the road,” Chambers had said before the game. “[It’s] a hostile environment, crowd going against you…. Your whole team needs to be together and play as a unit.”
With 2:58 left to play in the contest, Columbia’s Alex Rosenberg knocked down two free throws to secure a sizable, 75-55 advantage for his team at the end of a seven-point scoring streak.
From there, Saunders made a jumper off the glass at 2:35 and Chambers scored four points from the line to narrow the lead to 14.
With 1:40 left to play in the contest, co-captain Christian Webster stole the ball, was fouled on the steal, and made one of his two free throws to cut the deficit to 13.
But that was as close as the Crimson would get, as Harvard gave up three more free throws and scored just one more point—a shot from the stripe by freshman Agunwa Okolie—down the stretch.
After a back-and-fourth first half that resulted in a four-point Lions’ advantage, the Crimson scored five straight points after falling behind by 10 at the start of the second frame. But Harvard would not get back within five for the remainder of the game.
Columbia stretched its lead to 12 at 7:42 in the second after Rosenberg converted on a wide-open look from three, forcing Harvard to call a timeout and put on the full-court press.
But it was to little avail. Columbia point guard Brian Barbour—who was held scoreless in the first half despite averaging 13 points per game on the season—came alive midway through the second frame, adding some much needed cushion to his team’s lead. Barbour—who closed out the contest with eight points and as many assists—finished a layup and a triple and dished out two assists in the subsequent two minutes, leaving his team with a solid 18-point lead at the five-minute mark.
On the way to a career-high 27 points on 9-of-12 shooting, Lions’ guard Steve Frankoski put the icing on the 9-1 Columbia run with a mid-range jumper that put his team up, 68-50.
“I thought Frankoski was an amazing offensive weapon that they had today,” Amaker said. “They shot the ball well, got him out of the blocks early, and kept us on our heels throughout the game. We had no answer for him, and I thought they played off of him really well.”
In the first half, the Crimson led by as many as five points as late as 6:18 left in the opening frame, when two Saunders free throws pushed the Crimson to a 27-26 advantage.
But the Lions outscored Harvard, 11-5, in the ensuing four minutes to take a seven-point lead, 38-31—the biggest advantage held by any team in the first half—with just over two minutes left to play in the first half. Saunders—who finished with a team-high 27 points—pulled Harvard back within two possessions with a three-point shot of his own with 38 seconds to play in the half.
Frankoski led his team with 20 in the first twenty minutes, including back-to-back triples during the key stretch in which Columbia secured a lead it would not relinquish for the remainder of the game.
Despite the loss, the Crimson remains atop the Ivy League standings thanks to formerly-undefeated Princeton’s loss to Yale Saturday night.
“Our league is just like any other league,” Amaker said. “It’s conference play, and it’s February. It’s going to be all the way down to the wire.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second match of the day, sophomore heavyweight David Ng secured a victory for the Crimson over Princeton with a 4-1 win in the day’s final bout. Harvard clinched eight out of ten matches in a 27-6 win over the Tigers.
It was a strong finish to a day that began poorly for the Crimson (4-5, 2-4 EIWA), which fell, 24-6, to Penn (7-3, 4-1 EIWA) in its first leg of Saturday’s dual meet.
“Penn was a tough match for us—it was tough for the team,” co-captain Walter Peppelman said. “What happened at Penn was we lost the close matches. The score doesn’t show it, but we were really in that match, and we had many opportunities to win that match.”
Freshman Jeffrey Ott opened the day’s bouts at 125 when he matched up against the Quakers’ No. 20 Mark Rappo, who topped Ott with a 6-3 decision.
The Crimson had similar luck in the second bout at 133, with senior Shay Warren falling, 8-5.
Co-captain Steven Keith secured Harvard’s first win of the day. Keith defeated Penn’s No. 9 C.J. Cobb for the second time this season. The decision brought the score to 6-3 in favor of the Quakers.
“Obviously Steven had a great, great performance against C.J. Cobb, who was ranked ninth in the country at that time,” Peppelman said.
Harvard’s Peppelman snagged the second and final Crimson win over Penn at 157, a 6-0 shutout.
Harvard lost the following five bouts, but allowed only a combined 10 points for the Quakers.
“I just think things didn’t come together for us at Penn,” Peppelman said.
Sophomore James Fox almost edged out No. 9 Micah Burak, leading Penn’s All-American in the second period, but Fox eventually fell to Burak, 6-3.
“We lost a lot of close matches,” Keith said. “Their whole lineup is tough, but if we had taken a few of those close matches back with us, then I think we would’ve been right in there to beat them.”
After falling to Penn, Harvard wrestling shifted its attention to the Tigers and rebounded with a resounding victory.
“We were able to talk about [the loss] as a team,” Keith said. “We realized we didn’t perform our best against Penn, and, you know, we decided to come together to try to turn it around.”
Ott opened the meet again, this time with a 9-3 decision over Princeton’s Max Rogers. The freshman’s win gave the Crimson needed momentum after the preceding loss to the Quakers.
Ryan Osleeb continued Harvard’s success with a 7-2 decision, followed by a shutout from Keith, who blanked his opponent, 8-0.
Princeton finally earned a decision at 149, but Harvard answered with a winning bout after Peppelman forced a technical fall in the second period of his match.
“We learned from [our mistakes] and kind of turned it around for Princeton,” Peppelman said. “We went from being 2-8 against Penn and then going 8-2 against Princeton, which is good. Princeton is a team that beat us a year ago, and yesterday we came out and dominated, so I was really happy with our performance against Princeton.”
Freshman Devon Gobbo widened the scoring gap to 18-3, with a 6-4 decision. Princeton responded with a second and final win in a 7-3 decision at 174 lbs.
Sophomore Josh Popple secured a decision in a comeback in the third period, while Fox easily toppled his opponent in a 10-3 win.
Ng’s 4-1 decision ended the match in a 27-6 Harvard victory. The win sent the Crimson into its Sunday match 1-1 on the weekend.
“After the Penn match we learned that we need to be mentally tougher,” Peppelman said. “A lot of wrestling at the higher level is being focused. It’s a mental game; it’s about 25- to 50-percent physical and 50- to 75-percent mental. Those are the games we won against Princeton, the mental battles, the ones that took place at the end of the match, end of the periods, and overtime. Those are the big adjustments we made. We are going to carry this through until the end of the season, so I’m really excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team (5-15-2, 3-12-1 ECAC) snapped its losing streak in anticlimactic fashion Sunday evening, tying No. 17 Dartmouth (11-8-4, 7-6-3 ECAC), 1-1, at the Bright Hockey Center.
With just over three minutes left in regulation, it looked like Harvard would skate away with its ninth straight loss.  Dartmouth senior Dustin Walsh appeared to give the Big Green a late 2-1 advantage as it looked as if he had put back a rebound from classmate and captain Mike Keenan. But officials waved off the goal as a video review tagged Keenan with crease interference.
“We thought, seeing it on the replay and live, that their player interfered with our goalie’s ability to make the save to get across,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I thought they made the right call. I’m sure that the other side would see it a different way, but I thought our guys battled all game… It would have been unfortunate if that goal had counted.”
The Crimson would force overtime. After five minutes of extra time, the conference rivals remained deadlocked at one. It was a fitting conclusion to an even 60 minutes of hockey over which neither squad managed to gain a solid upper hand.
Defender Andy Simpson provided Dartmouth an early lead less than 10 minutes into the opening frame. A close-angle shot from the right wing slipped past the pads of junior Crimson goaltender Raphael Girard for the Big Green sophomore’s second goal of the season.
“I don’t think we started our best, but I think we built up through the second and third period,” senior forward Marshall Everson said. “I felt that at that time [of Dartmouth’s goal] we had more of the momentum… In the past we haven’t really dealt with those types of back-breaker goals so well, so it was tough to give up, but I was pretty proud of the way the guys battled back the rest of the game.”
With less than nine minutes left in the second, Crimson co-captain Danny Biega drew a trip from Dartmouth freshman Connor Dempsey—brother of Harvard women’s hockey co-captain Jillian Dempsey—to earn Harvard’s third power play of the game.
The Crimson had entered the match with an NCAA Div. I-worst 9.52-percent success rate (8-for-84) on the man advantage. This time, Harvard capitalized on its opportunity.
More than a minute into the power play, Everson received a tape-to-tape centering pass from senior forward Alex Fallstrom and laced a close-range equalizer over the right shoulder of Dartmouth goaltender Cab Morris.
“We won a battle in the corner, which is big. We haven’t been winning as many as we need to this year,” Everson said. “[Sophomore forward Colin] Blackwell made a good pass down to Fally, and Fally really made a patient play and found me in a nice area.”
While Dartmouth threatened to strike in the closing minutes, Harvard also had its fair share of opportunities to seize the lead late.
“We missed the net five or six times that really negated a couple of great scoring chances,” Donato said. “I thought a couple of our best chances never made it to the net, probably three or four in the third.”
In the final frame of regulation, Dartmouth freshman defender Geoff Ferguson covered up the puck in the Big Green crease after a slap shot from Harvard junior blueliner Dan Ford bounced loose. Officials declined to award the Crimson a penalty shot.
“Our guys thought he used his hand to cover the puck in the crease,” Donato said. “But the refs are down there, and it’s one of those things where there’s not much you can do about. We just wanted to keep playing.”
In overtime, Dartmouth outshot Harvard, 3-0, but failed to break through. Girard finished with a game-high 26 saves on the night as the Big Green edged the Crimson in shots, 27-22.
With the tie, Harvard picked up its first point in conference play since a 4-1 win over Cornell on Nov. 16. The last-place Crimson trails the 11th-place Big Red by three points in the ECAC standings with six games remaining in the regular season.
Because of the weather postponement, Harvard now faces a quicker-than-expected turn around as it prepares to face Boston University in the Beanpot consolation game Monday evening.
“We’re positive coming out of this game. It’s always fun to play BU, and it’s always a big moment if we can beat them,” said Everson, who will be competing in his last Beanpot game. “We [seniors] want to make an impression or at least go out on top as much as we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the Harvard track and field team’s first meet of the indoor season a few weeks ago, coach Jason Saretsky predicted that the school record board would undergo “a pretty major facelift” in 2013. With their performances on Saturday, three members of the women’s team provided the scalpels.
In the team’s most crucial meet to date, junior thrower and co-captain Adabelle Ekechukwu, sophomore sprinter Danielle Barbian, and co-captain pole vaulter Sydnie Leroy broke Crimson records in their respective events. Ekechukwu’s performance was most impressive, as she also broke the Ivy League record by becoming the first woman in conference history to eclipse 20-meters in the weight throw.
Despite these stellar individual outings, the Harvard women finished second at the annual HYP meet, which was held at Princeton’s Jadwin Gymnasium. The Princeton women took home the team title, tallying 79 points to Harvard’s 55. On the men’s side, the Tigers topped their rivals for the 22nd consecutive time, outscoring Harvard and Yale, 88-59-23, to earn first place.
“Obviously, I’d like to come away from that meet with the two wins, but more important was the work we got in,” Saretsky said. “Throughout the season, we continue to rewrite the record books…. I think we’ve got some real momentum and some real excitement going into the [Heptagonals] in two weeks.”
The women’s weight throw was perhaps the premier event of the weekend, as Ekechukwu battled Princeton’s highly touted freshman Julia Ratcliffe, who was expected to challenge Ekechukwu for Ivy supremacy. Ratcliffe, a native of New Zealand, currently holds the record for the weight throw in her home country (19.69 meters).
But it was Ekechukwu who ruled the day, throwing 20.03 meters on her first attempt and 20.11 on her third to break the record. Ratcliffe also turned in a personal-best performance by throwing 19.74 meters, but it was not enough to top the junior, who is also a Crimson arts and multimedia editor.
“[Ekechukwu] has been ready for this for a while now, so it was fantastic to see things finally click,” Saretsky said. “I still think there’s more to come [from her].”
Barbian and classmate Ashley Collinsworth teamed up to take the top two spots in the 60-meter dash. Barbian, who already held the school record in the event, ran her personal-best time of 7.59 seconds. Collinsworth was hot on her teammate’s heels, finishing in 7.78 seconds to give Harvard eight total team points in the event.
“About a quarter of the way through the race…it wasn’t going as well as I hoped,” Barbian said. “But I was able to make some adjustments and finish the race really well.”
“I was happy [with my performance],” Barbian added. “It’s a confidence boost to see that I’ve been running pretty well, but there are still some things I can change before Ivy League Championships to hopefully run faster.”
Leroy, the final Crimson record setter, tied for first place in the pole vault with Princeton’s Tory Worthen. Both women cleared every height up to 3.91 meters, the new Harvard record, but were unable to clear the bar at four meters.
“She did a really great job of backing up the pre-meet talk that we had about really getting after it and leaving it all out there,” Saretsky said. “Just like with Adabelle, there’s even more to come [from her].
Senior Mary Hirst also had a strong showing on Saturday, taking home the high jump with a clearance of 1.80 meters.
On the men’s side, junior Maksim Korolev dominated the mile run, finishing in 4:05. The junior, who was recently named next season’s cross country captain, finished nearly four seconds ahead of the Tigers’ James Shirvell, who finished in second place. Crimson junior Ryan Romain and senior Sean Pohorence also placed in the event, coming in third and fourth place, respectively, to give Harvard eight team points.
“Maks is in great shape,” Saretsky said of Korolev, who beat his personal record by six seconds. “He just went out there and kind of did his thing. It was fun.”
The men’s throwers provided a preview of the impact they will have at this month’s Indoor Heptagonal Championships, finishing 1-2-3 in both the shot put and the weight throw. Junior Dustin Brode took home the top spot in the shot put with a heave of 17.41, with sophomores Ben Glauser and Igor Liokumovich rounding out the top three. Glauser took over in the weight throw, just missing the 18-meter mark by throwing 17.98 meters.
“I think this meet definitely showed that we’re a force to be reckoned with,” Barbian said. “In other years, we’ve been content with taking third, or being in the top half [of the Ivy League], but this year, I think we’ve come in with this attitude that we can’t settle for anything less than first.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The women’s basketball team took a page out of the men’s basketball playbook this weekend.
On Sunday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, where the Crimson has not lost all season, Harvard (13-6, 4-1 Ivy) squandered a first-half 13-point lead before eking out an overtime win over Cornell (10-9, 2-3 Ivy), 69-60.
“I’m very proud we toughed it out and won,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “There were things that happened that I was a little surprised by, and I think our team needs to learn how to extend the lead rather than lose the lead. Unfortunately, that’s been happening too often, and for the kids that we have and the experience that we have and the talent that we have, we have to find the mental fortitude to extend a lead.”
After going 8-for-13 from the charity stripe during regulation, the Crimson rallied during the extra period and sunk all 10 of its free throws, including four from senior forward Victoria Lippert, to pull away from the Big Red.
“It’s all about that pressure free-throw shooting in practice,” Lippert said.
Overtime was dominated by fouls, as 10 of Harvard’s 16 points came from the line, and free throws accounted for all of Cornell’s points except for an unguarded three at the end of the period.
Sophomore forward Erin McDonnell hit a pull-up jumper to give the Crimson the first points in the extra period following a drought that had lasted since there was 1:35 left in regulation. Harvard would not relinquish the lead again.
After two converted free shots by the Big Red’s Allyson DiMagno, McDonnell grabbed an offensive board off her own miss and fed it to Lippert, who tossed in the ball to push Harvard out to a three-point lead. Junior guard Christine Clark then drove in for a layup to give the Crimson some breathing room.
DiMagno, who netted 20 points and 14 rebounds to be the only player on the day with a double-double, scored all but three of the Big Red’s points in overtime and hit two jumpers near the end of the second half to knot the game at 51-all. Harvard struggled all day with stopping the junior, who averages 13.4 points per game.
“That wasn’t the game plan, to let [DiMagno] have that many,” Lippert said. “It’s definitely something that we’re going to correct for next time, pay more attention to her. That’s just too many points and rebounds for somebody to have against us. We’re not too pleased about those stats.”
Delaney-Smith called a timeout immediately after Cornell senior forward Clare Fitzpatrick drove in for a layup to tie the game at 53, but the Big Red, with fouls to give, fouled sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle with 1.6 seconds remaining, and the Crimson couldn’t get a clean inbounds pass in to take a shot with the time remaining, sending the game into overtime.
“[I told them before overtime that] this is our gym,” Delaney-Smith said. “It’s all about defense for five minutes.”
Harvard jumped out to an early 9-2 lead and never trailed in the game. Clark paved the way for the Crimson’s quick beginning, scoring eight of her 15 points in the first 10 minutes of the game. The Crimson dominated inside in the first half, outrebounding Cornell 24-12 and scoring 14 points in the paint to the Big Red’s four.
Cornell went on a 7-3 run to close the first half, and a layup from DiMagno at the beginning of the second half closed the lead to four before Lippert sunk a shot from downtown. The senior broke a four-minute drought with three consecutive baskets to return the lead to double digits after missing all four of her shots in the first half.
“Vic wasn’t playing particularly well in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said. “We were all telling her to catch and shoot some. She’s a senior—she generally doesn’t have to be told that, but I do think that our team is trying to share the ball, move the ball, and get easier shots, and so in her effort to maybe do that, she passed up shots I don’t want her to pass up. I thought she did much better in the second half.”
The Big Red reversed the advantage on Harvard in the second half, pulling down 20 rebounds to Harvard’s 13 and besting the Crimson in points down low as well. Fitzpatrick, who hit the final shot of the half, contributed 13 points to shrink Harvard’s lead.
“They came back off of second chances,” Lippert said. “They were kind of getting more attempts offensively and getting their own rebounds and put backs, and I think that may have contributed to them coming back.”
Lippert recorded 19 points to lead Harvard’s offensive effort while Clark and Fagbenle joined her in double-digits with 15 and 12 points, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second weekend of competition, the Harvard women’s water polo team started off with two straight losses, but righted the ship the next day with a pair of victories.
Playing in the Princeton Invitational in New Jersey, the Crimson took on two of the best teams in the nation on Saturday in No. 4 California and No. 10 Princeton. Although unranked Harvard competed with both teams for stretches, the Crimson fell to the Golden Bears, 14-5, and lost to the Tigers by a score of 11-7.
Harvard took on easier competition Sunday and bounced back first against the New York Athletic Club, cruising to a 20-9 victory. The Crimson ended its road trip on a similarly strong note with a 19-4 win against Villanova.
“I thought it was a really good weekend,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Cal and Princeton are two top-ten teams, and they were both close games in the third, so I thought we did really well. We don’t want to be playing our best water polo in February. We made some mistakes, and we have some things we can go back and work on.”
HARVARD 20, NYAC 9
Facing off against the New York Athletic Club, the Crimson dominated from start to finish and coasted to an 11-goal victory.
The team outscored NYAC in each quarter, and every Harvard player who entered the pool registered at least a point in the contest.
“I think that’s what makes this team so special, is that all ten of [the players] are going to produce this year and do something,” Minnis said. “And I think that’s fun, to watch them go out there and support each other and play hard for each other.”
The Crimson was led by freshman Charlotte Hendrix, who posted a career-high seven goals to spearhead the Harvard offense. Hendrix also contributed on the defensive end with a team-best three steals.
"I think I performed decently,” Hendrix said. “I still think I have things to improve on, but I was just the one to finish the play; it was really all of us working together to get to that point.”
Freshman Yoshi Andersen and sophomore Victoria Frager posted solid offensive numbers with three goals each, and two other players followed with a pair apiece.
The Crimson capped off the weekend with a 19-4 win against Villanova. Harvard took advantage of five goals while up a player to record its largest margin of victory on the season.
PRINCETON 11, HARVARD 7
The Crimson failed to get anything going in the first half against the Tigers, and went into the break trailing, 6-2.
Although the Harvard offense kept pace with Princeton in the second half, with each team scoring five goals, the Crimson could never overcome the early deficit.
Co-captain Aisha Price combined with Andersen to total four goals as well as four steals.
Harvard had trouble breaching the Tigers’ last line of defense, as Princeton goalie Ashleigh Johnson tied her personal saves record with 17. Sophomore goalie Ariel Dukes anchored the Crimson in net with seven saves.
“It’s a team effort, from our freshmen up to our seniors, and everybody played well and played hard,” Minnis said. “That’s something we talk about all the time, is playing as a group and playing as a team. Dukes did a great job in the goal.”
CALIFORNIA 14, HARVARD 5
In its first game of the weekend, the Crimson fell to one of the top teams in the nation in Cal by a nine-goal margin.
The Golden Bears found themselves up three at the half and Harvard would never bridge the gap as Cal extended its lead by outscoring the Crimson by six in the second frame.
The Golden Bears’ offense was in control for the entire contest and outpaced the Crimson in each quarter of play. The 14 goals surrendered were the most Harvard has allowed all season.
Cal was led by Emily Csikos, who played with the Canadian National Team last year. The senior contributed five goals, more than double the total of any other scorer.
Junior Shayna Price led Harvard in scoring with two goals, and three other players racked up one goal apiece.
“I think right now we’re still learning what each other is capable of and what we do offensively and defensively,” Hendrix said. “But I think every single game we’re improving and getting to know each other better. And by the end of the season, or pretty soon, we’re just going to come together and dominate.”

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
Sunday brunch in the dining halls may boast veritaffles, fresh fruits, and those cheesy, gooey, pieces of fried chicken and broccoli, but what if you are craving something heartier or more classic, like eggs benedict or steak and eggs?
On Saturdays and Sundays, Daedalus, tucked in between Adams and Quincy House, offers an extensive brunch menu that will satisfy your cravings.
Not Your Average Benedict ($13.95), the restaurant's most popular brunch entrée, swaps Canadian bacon with smoked salmon and adds generous slices of avocado. The split-open English muffins are topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. The creamy textures from the avocado, hollandaise sauce, and egg yolks balance nicely with the side of crispy home fries.
The Steak + Eggs ($16.95) is the perfect option if you are looking to get protein into your body. The well-done steak, about the size of a small palm, is accompanied by two eggs of any style, home fries, and toasted English muffins with jam and butter. Nothing too exquisite or mind-blowing about the entrée, but it certainly did its job of providing balanced nutrients.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
WHAT IT IS
In the wake of the Great Recession, formal college education and its ever-increasing price tag has been under scrutiny from the popular media. To make higher education accessible for all, Bill Gates, Florida governor Rick Scott, and others have proposed the implementation of a $10,000 bachelors degree program. Is it possible? A recent op-ed in the New York Times details Arthur C. Brooks' flirtation with traditional college, followed by what his parents fondly dubbed a "gap-decade," and finally a return to academia by correspondence. Brooks managed to complete his undergraduate degree as well as two graduate ones without obtaining a cent of debt, and most importantly, all for less than $10,000. 
 
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
Everyone knows the jab at the price of college (specifically, the cost of Harvard) from "Good Will Hunting": most of us are paying $150,000 for an education that, with a bit of determination and and a membership card, we could have gotten for $1.50 in late fees at the library. Unfortunately, the worn-down strip on a library card doesn't replace the increasing need for a B.A., or even an M.A., if we want to get jobs in this competitive economy (unless, of course, you create the most popular social networking website of all time out of your dorm room and eschew a degree entirely). 
 
SO WHAT?
Brooks specifically notes that at times his "college education has been the target of ridicule," and that he is "no Harvard man." Is a Harvard education the antithesis of the move towards education on a budget?  It is an undeniable fact that the high price of residential four-year colleges in the U.S. shuts out many students who cannot pay; others who are willing to take out loans graduate with crippling debt in an already uncertain job market. Some of the most recent statistics about the cost of college are almost comical: with two thirds of college grads facing an average debt of $20,000, those who work at the ubiquitous Starbucks would have to make 228,000 cups of coffee to pay off their (seemingly useless) degree; 1 in 5 grads must accept a job that doesn't even require a degree; while the average family income grew 147% from 1982-2007, the cost of a bachelor's degree rose 440%. With staggering numbers like these, it's hard to not see the incredible appeal of a $10,000 education.
 
Brooks' tale is one of enormous success—to support a family while simultaneously earning a degree is nothing short of a herculean effort. But his method is not the only newly innovative way to earn an education on a budget; massive open online courses, or MOOCs, have gained recent popularity (see, for example, Harvard and MIT's own edX initiative). Community colleges, long since a more wallet-friendly method of earning a degree, cost approximately $3,000 a semester for a two-year associate's degree; city or state universities cost more than twice as much for a four-year bachelor's degree. 
 
The graduation rates for these programs is what is sobering. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, only 35.4% of all students in Massachusetts public colleges graduated in 4 years; 56.4% did so in 6 years. The rates plummet to 16.4% for 2-year programs, while private colleges have nearly double those graduation rates. 
 
THE TAKEAWAY
The $10,000 degree is a wonderful idea—get a degree that would have otherwise put you into debt, graduate with no loans and burst forth into the job market a newly minted college grad. But what the idea doesn't address is the reason why so many students fail to graduate from college in the first place. As a college student just entering her second semester, I know I could have never done what Brooks did—I've come to rely on the extensive advising and support systems offered at Harvard through academic advisors, PAFs, proctors, and most importantly, fellow students. Yes, living and studying at Harvard and other four-year residential colleges costs a lot more than $10,000. But most college-age kids I know wouldn't be able to have the discipline or wherewithal to complete their coursework through correspondence. Will a $10,000 degree provide advising and counseling? Could the student conceivably speak to a professor, or discuss a paper and study for an exam with a fellow degree candidate? Or will it, like so many of the more expensive degree programs in place today, yield low graduation rates? Unfortunately, Brooks' experience seems to be the exception, not the rule. 
 
The main problem with the gross discrepancy between cost and success in the U.S. collegiate system is one that digs deeper than a price tag—it has roots in the delicacy of our economy, issues with public elementary, middle, and high school systems, as well as scholarships, grants, and continuing advising programs. States such as Florida and Texas are currently on their way to implementing such a program in their public universities system. Only time will tell if their soon-to-be-matriculated students will be as successful at education on a budget as was Arthur C. Brooks.
