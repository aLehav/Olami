After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few bands’ legacies are as confounding as Steely Dan’s. Despite being one of the most beloved and acclaimed groups of the ’70s, they’ve largely faded from the rock canon. Aside from “Aja,” their token “classic,” and maybe their single “Kid Charlemagne,” the Dream Daddy-certified greatest guitar solo ever, most of their work has been largely forgotten and omitted from critical discussion of the ’70s. To be fair, the band didn’t do itself any favors. Over time, as Steely Dan more obviously became lead singer Donald Fagen’s and guitarist Walter Becker’s own pet project, their sound gradually grew more affected, referential, and generally inaccessible to the point where gatekeepers ignore or deride them. But the biggest single knock against Steely Dan is how cold and inauthentic they feel.
So much of musical appeal across popular genres is predicated on a sense of authenticity and emotion. There are increasingly many acclaimed albums, like Mount Eerie’s “A Crow Looked at Me” or Frank Ocean’s “Blonde,” rooted in these sensibilities. Steely Dan, however, seems to take pride in sounding as distant as possible. Fagen sings disaffected lyrics in a soulless, nasal whine, and the songs—their sophisticated chords, jazzy progressions, and seamless mixes—tend to be so utterly flawless that they almost sound passionless. Rockists have retroactively dismissed Steely Dan for having a wimpy or soft sound. Unlike Fleetwood Mac’s, another band criticized for this sound, their songs never had anything to do with Becker or Fagen themselves. Their protagonists were generally unlovable losers, like the narrator of “Peg,” who tries to convince the titular character to become a pinup girl. Moreover, in an era that glamorized sole authorship, Steely Dan had a rotating cavalcade of some of the top jazz musicians in the country that they used whenever needed. The band’s relentless work ethic and technical songwriting skill make it difficult to fault them on any objective grounds. This makes their albums frustratingly slippery for would-be critics.
But criticism of Steely Dan as soulless and as inauthentic obscures just how brilliant they are. In few places is this more obvious than on “Aja,” the penultimate album of their original run. First of all, the album’s production is in contention for being the greatest ever. Every component feels isolated and clear, yet meshes spectacularly. Fagen and Becker understood their vision and assembled the personnel to make it happen. From the highest level to the microscopic, they prove themselves masters of structure: Songs feature complex, anticipation-building introductions, accessible but fresh melodies, dazzling chord resolutions, choruses and verses that musically complement each other perfectly, and solos that last just long enough.
What’s most illuminative, however, is the typically stellar, Faulkneresque imagery of the album. While all their albums possess this evocative mythologizing of lowlives, “Aja” is where Steely Dan’s imagery is most unified. Named as a reference to a Louis Armstrong quote mistakenly labelling bebop “Chinese music,” “Aja” weaves four novel concepts into its core: bebop musicians seeking fulfilment, a California sound, pure jazz rock, and a sense of odyssey, all shrouded in Fagen and Becker’s acerbic wit and masterful technique. While its status as the best Steely Dan album is debatable, its unity and coherence as a pseudo-concept album helps cement Fagen and Becker as the witty, subversive geniuses the canon never should have forgotten.
While their previous albums tended to feature a variety of lowlives trying and failing to succeed in a variety of ways, “Aja” focuses on one theme: bebop musicians searching for adventure and enlightenment in places commonly derided. In the title track, it’s a mental institution. In “Deacon Blues,” it’s hedonism. Their protagonists’ fates are always ominous, but Fagen sings as though he takes special glee in their demise. There’s a strange pleasantness in casting away all societal concerns and succumbing to a journey for enlightenment that can only end poorly. Although “Home At Last” is the only song that’s a formal homage to Homer’s “Odyssey” (“Still I remain tied to the mast”), all of “Aja” is about a similar spiritual journey. The destination is not home but a sense of real enlightenment. The journey never really reaches completion—the songs’ leads always succumb to their sirens. But “Aja,” if nothing else, is about embracing their call, and doing so gleefully.
To create a sound for such an album, Fagen and Becker crafted a masterful, laid back style that nonetheless emphasize the talent of their backing musicians, some of the best studio musicians in the world. Compared to the dark undertones of their previous album ( “The Royal Scam”), “Aja” is sunny, if less emotional. At the surface, it feels like easy listening music. This pleasantness belies a sort of depressing sleaziness as the main characters succumb to misfortune. This is why people consider “Aja”’s sound California-inspired. It bears some curious similarities with “Annie Hall,” where quintessential New York Jews use the imagery of the West Coast to explore ideas of material and spiritual happiness. Where “Aja” differs is in the way that, instead of pulling away, it leans into this imagery, embracing smooth jazz. By this point, Steely Dan had been moving towards jazz rock for some time, largely beginning on 1974’s “Pretzel Logic,” their second truly great album. But until “Aja” they had never totally given in. On “Aja” the shift is almost radical, a departure from guitar-heavy rock in favor of smooth, pleasant jazz. In a jazz setting, Becker and Fagen are especially masterful. Everything is immaculately tight, designed for maximum pleasure. Their rotating cast of brilliant personnel fills any roles they need, often investing excruciating amounts of labor in perfecting certain sounds. Long considered a listening standard for audiophiles, “Aja” represents the apex of Steely Dan’s sonic experimentation.
Maybe they are cold, maybe they are totally inauthentic. But if they can create works like “Aja,” does it even matter? The smooth sound, the witty depiction of demise, and the overall technical mastery all combine to create this perfectly uncool masterpiece that sounds nothing like anything around it. On “Aja,” Fagen and Becker bucked the norms of commercial music and succeeded at the highest level.
In an era of rebellion, Steely Dan was the most subversive band. As punk took over and brought its ethic of speed, energy, and activism, Steely Dan’s songs grew more methodical and passionless. Jazz was dying out in popularity, but Fagen and Becker only embraced it more. As people criticized them for sounding so insincere and calculated, they embraced their disconnectedness. They rebelled against virtually all norms of contemporary mainstream music to create “Aja,” proving that sometimes, rejecting authenticity is the coolest thing to do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Mar. 24, a crowd of students, alumni, and community members congregated in the Lowell Lecture Hall to view the Harvard Undergraduate Drummers’ spring show THUDlash. Leading up to the show, the hall filled with smiling faces, some old, and some young.
Zev J. Nicolai-Scanio ’22, who will be a freshman at Harvard this fall, came to support his friend Sam Markowitz ’21. “I feel like music is definitely going to be part of my Harvard experience once I get here,” Nicolai-Scanio said. “I went to the fall THUD concert and absolutely loved it. It was a great mixture of the things I enjoy about music. The sense of camaraderie, the lightheartedness, but yet the professionalism.”
Suddenly, the lights dimmed, the banter softened, and the audience erupted in applause as directors Adam B. Wrobel ’19 and Dody T. Eid ’20 ran onto the stage. Wrobel laid only one ground rule for the crowd: “If you see something you like, yell.” And with that, Eid and Wrobel introduced the show’s opener, the Harvard Beatboxing Society. The three-man troupe performed a trap rendition of “Elmo’s World,” among other hits. Once the HBS took a bow, THUDlash commenced.
Like previous THUD shows, THUDlash’s plot was quirky and reference-heavy. The show followed the cast of THUD as they attempted to learn the perfect percussion piece from the Percussion Wizard. Along the way, they face hardships such as going to the Quad, losing their percussion buckets, and passing out from consuming the Wizard’s “magic pills” bought from the Market in the Square. But the THUD team overcame these challenges, and with the help of the tough but loving Percussion Wizard a la J.K. Simmons in “Whiplash,” the team was able to play the “Perfect Piece.”
Through the course of the show, THUD accomplished feats like playing percussion with Solo cups on two stacked tables, keeping up a complex drum beat on buckets while the buckets are kicked around to other drummers, and playing the drums on buckets placed on elevated legs.
Saim Raza ’19 thought the show was incredibly multifaceted. “It had everything from dance to singing to—obviously—percussion. It was one of the best performances of any artistic show I’ve seen on campus. It had everything you would want in a show,” Raza said.
The show ended with a tribute to the group’s outgoing seniors. Nathan W. Siegelaub ’18, Cole R. Durbin ’18, Daphne C. Thompson ’18, former Crimson Associate Managing Editor, and Aisha I. Suara ’18 were honored with roses, warm embraces, and enthusiastic applause from the audience. For Suara, Saturday’s performance was a bittersweet moment.
“Honestly I’m really sad it’s over,” Suara said. “THUD has been a great part of my experience. It’s been a great two years. I love everything about THUD, the people, the experience. It’s really just a great time. I think this was our best show.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hailing from the windswept steppes of Central Asia, eight cast members of the multimedia production of “Qyrq Qyz” (Forty Girls), an ancient epic about a nomadic band of Turkic women warriors, brought their music to Harvard’s Paine Hall on March 6. They played with a wide array of traditional instruments from Central Asian nomadic life, including a two-stringed instrument called a “qobyz” and a “jygach ooz komuz,” a wooden plate held at the lips with strings attached to it that create a unique bouncing sound. The women sang in plaintive wails evoking the distant horizons of an arid desert, accompanied by hand drums that beat like the hoofbeats of the horses which the Forty Girls rode so skillfully in the legends. Warm and mesmerizing, their voices and the unfamiliar rhythms played on the instruments transport the audience to an entirely different landscape: terribly open, beautiful, and lonely.
Directed by Saodat Ismailova, a filmmaker from Uzbekistan, the music was certainly cinematic in scale. The original production featured film scenes that depicted Gulaim, the teenage leader of the Forty Girls, who defended her land from Eastern invaders in the legend, along with gorgeous shots of the steppes. The epic of the female warrior is known throughout Central Asia in its myriad variations in the oral traditions of the region, and it is often compared to the stories of the Amazons in Greek mythology. It is a remnant of ancient matriarchal societies of Central Asia, and though the stories have faded, their mark still remains in those cultures today.
The eight women sat in a semi-circle on the Paine Hall stage and took turns singing and playing their instruments, concluding the performance with a final collaboration. Some of the musicians displayed exceptional virtuosity—Makhabat Kobogonova, who sang and played four different instruments, played the “komuz” with distinct flairs of hand movements fluttering in four directions across the strings at breakneck pace. Raushan Urazbayeva, the lead musician, performed a beautiful solo performance on the qobyz. The musicians seemed just as heroic as the women they were singing of in their almost martial skillfulness and poise with their instruments, while the singers sang in strong, open cries that seemed to sweep across vast plains. They often broke into grand recitative-like passages of speak-singing, and although it was in a foreign language, it was impossible not to feel the depth of emotion in their voices, and to deduce the heroic content.
The program notes also provided translations of the lyrics of some of the songs, offering a window into their poetic depth. One verse reads: “When Gulayim opened her eyes, / Moonless darkness was transformed into dawn. / Gulayim was like a hundred-colored wreath, / And if the sun’s flames were to fade, / The light from her moonlike face / Would fill the farthest reaches of the universe.”
It was a breath of fresh air to hear the music of women of a non-Western culture. The eight Central Asian women on stage struck a contrast with the names of the composers that lined the top of Paine Hall, all male and from the European tradition, including names like Beethoven, Schubert, Mozart. According to Ismailova, despite Central Asia’s tradition of epics featuring powerful women, music-making has always been traditionally a man’s role, and it has only been since the middle of the last century that women have been beginning to learn how to play. Deeply moving and gorgeous, the concert seemed to brim over with pride and appreciation for the woman’s spiritual experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every law student has met a lawyer who cannot help but offer the advice, “Don’t go to law school.” The misery in the legal profession is seemingly ubiquitous. The mental health crisis facing modern lawyers has been reported so extensively, it barely needs repetition. Yet the causes have been woefully overlooked.
Why hasn’t Harvard taken responsibility for its contribution to this professional malaise? Last year, we pushed Harvard Law School to begin an annual mental health survey to measure the welfare of the student body. We began writing law school-specific survey questions based on our experience as students and worked with university health researchers and administrators to publicize the survey.
The results presented a grisly reality. Among 886 respondents, 25 percent reported suffering from depression. For context, according to the CDC, 7.7 percent of individuals aged 20 to 39 from the general population suffer from depression. 24.2 percent of Law School survey respondents reported suffering from anxiety, and 20.5 percent said they were at heightened risk of suicide. 66 percent of respondents said that they experienced new mental health challenges during law school. Nearly 61.8 percent said they had frequent or intense imposter syndrome experiences at school and in measuring social connectedness, 8.2 percent stated they had zero people they could open up to about their most private feelings without having to hold back.
But the problem is not confined to the Law School. In 2014, researchers Jerome Organ, David Jaffe, and Katherine Bender built on the work of Lawrence Krieger, Ken Sheldon and more, to revitalize the discussion of law student mental health. They surveyed students from 15 ABA-approved law schools and found high incidence of drug use, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. Additionally, Law students at Yale and Georgetown surveyed their peers, and students at other schools have also demanded action.  Evidence of pervasive suffering calls for decisive action now.
We therefore call on all law schools to survey their own student bodies every year and release the survey data. The court of public opinion should hold them accountable.
Studies that anonymize school participants allow schools to shirk individual responsibility. Only institution-specific surveys done year to year can measure whether policy changes at each school were effective. Harvard Law School is the only law school that has taken the first step towards change with an in-depth, initial survey and other schools should do at least the same.
Because an annual barometer of student wellbeing is only useful if coupled with new policies, we also advocate for Harvard to take these next steps:
First, release a full and anonymized report of the data. A large-scale community mobilization was critical to discover the truth about the Law School’s mental health status and it was built on the promise to combat the crisis together. To achieve this goal, students were willing to put in the time to answer invasive questions about their mental health struggles, including potential struggles with suicide ideation, alcohol consumption, and more. Students deserve to have ownership of the data that they themselves created; as sophisticated and sensitive allies, students also understand that data must be handled responsibly, that patterns may not have statistical significance, that correlation is not causation, and that results should be contextualized. But if the data is kept behind administrative doors, it will be impossible for students to offer perspective to improve the way data is analyzed and it will be clear that students are not respected as equal stakeholders in a crisis that affects them; naturally, it would then be difficult to galvanize students behind a future survey. A full community effort can only be created with full transparency.
Second, hire more full-time therapists who are diverse in both personal background and professional specialty. Only 33 percent of student respondents that were found to be depressed were being treated. Harvard should also provide weekly, appointment-free drop-in counseling sessions.  However, any increase in access to care to new students must not be at the expense of ongoing or specialized treatment to students already seeking care. The general increase in providers is an ask especially of our leadership, University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow, to increase Health Services’ capacity at all levels.
Third, train students how to informally counsel and detect signs of distress in individuals who may be facing mental health challenges. These trainings can develop lawyering skills when applied to client service and facilitate earlier peer or self-intervention for students struggling with mental health. It is evident that most of our classmates suffer in isolation; a majority of student respondents indicated that they believed less than half of their peers faced mental health challenges, though 83 percent of respondents reported having such challenges.
Fourth, foster deeper connections between faculty and students. This could include more candid discussions about mental health struggles in the legal profession, or even the struggles of the faculty themselves. Our survey shows that students with more connections to faculty members display lower rates of depression and anxiety. But, as it stands, only 8 percent of students said they would feel comfortable reaching out to faculty about mental health challenges. Our educators should be open to combining traditional legal teaching tools with new pedagogy that cultivates conversation and de-stigmatizes mental health.
Fifth, as a leading law school that produces one of the largest graduating classes, Harvard should pressure state bar associations to eliminate questions that do not assess a candidate’s competency to practice law.  Licensing bodies require candidates to answer probing character and fitness questions as a prerequisite to practicing law; some have even discriminated against students based on treatment or diagnosis in violation of the ADA.  Basing assessments of competency on a candidate’s medical record—which may include the diagnosis of mental health conditions—rather than a candidate’s actual conduct stigmatizes mental illness and actually deters students from seeking counseling for fear they will eventually need to report. Indeed, our survey found that 19 percent of respondents were reluctant to seek help due to concerns about bar eligibility. This reluctance was correlated with heightened depression, anxiety, and risk of suicide.
In the face of this mental health crisis, law schools must reverse the trend of increased mental health challenges. By committing to our asks, Harvard should engage in this cooperative effort to investigate root causes of mental health challenges, test new interventions, and begin to inaugurate practicing lawyers that finally say to future law students, “definitely go to law school.” Or at least, “maybe go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week is Holy Week, and truly it is a time of miracles: Christ raised from the dead, the lapsed returned to the pews, and Harvard professors contemplating the possibility of grace in the face of human depravity.
Our reading today comes from Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”, the wildly popular class taught by David J. Malan ’99. The course has a turbulent history with academic dishonesty—one that includes a full tenth of the class, or over 60 students, being investigated by the Honor Council in 2017—though perhaps charitably it also is more rigorous than many courses about checking for such transgressions.
In response, Malan announced earlier this month that he plans to adopt a policy, termed the “near occasion of sin” rule, where students who say they feel they have no recourse but to cheat can instead receive penalty-free or penalty-reduced extensions on their assignments.
It’s sad that this policy seems to have baked into it a resignation to the inevitability of cheating, though I suppose that that rule—named by its creator at Princeton after a piece of Catholic dogma—has got its heart in the right place. Malan says that academic dishonesty is “almost always the result of poor, late-night decisions with stress levels high and deadlines looming,” a conclusion that seems plausible.
Indeed, elsewhere in his blog post, Malan indicates that the “regret clause,” another CS50-specific policy that violators who self-report within a certain time frame can sidestep the traditional Harvard College academic dishonesty disciplinary process, has enabled the course to identify students struggling with external health or family challenges and provide access to professional counseling.
Nevertheless, both these policies suggest a certain helplessness in the face of undergrads’ behavior. Students, CS50 seems to believe, have an intrinsic proclivity to cheat. Left without emergency exits and amnesty clauses, they cannot help but turn to it.
Approaches like the regret clause and the “near occasion of sin” rule are designed to give undergraduates a way out, either just before or just after the cheating is consummated. In a strange sort of way, they’ve got weirdly Calvinist overtones to their fatality and outlook.
In that sense, the use of “sin” as a euphemism (or dysphemism?) for academic dishonesty seems actually quite apt. It is, as the Catholic Encyclopedia’s definition says of the phrase “occasions of sin,” a result of “the frailty common to humanity.”
The claim is a somewhat depressing one to hear. The traditional line had always been, as Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris told CS50 last fall, that students faced with a choice between a worse grade and academic dishonesty must be taught to always choose the former.
Malan now suggests that that choice never existed. Students won’t elect to get a worse grade, he says, they’ll just cheat. The only way to reduce the number of technical instances of plagiarism, therefore, is to make extensions permanently available without penalty. A willingness to cheat is now understood as a natural, if not necessarily accepted, part of Harvard students’ nature.
It is sad that the bar for expectations of us is so low, for it also implies a certain moral exculpability about academic dishonesty. CS50’s policies reflect a belief that we’d all cheat given the right circumstances. It’s a condition to be managed, not eradicated.
It’s ironic that this policy is labeled the “occasion of sin,” since Catholic theology makes clear that—while in agreement about the underlying impulse towards evil—the phrase represents the individual moral imperative to resist that temptation. “The same obligation which binds us to refrain from sin requires us to shun its occasion,” the Catholic Encyclopedia’s entry says.
It does not seem too far fetched that the same would be asked and expected of students. As the theology suggests, the better road is not always the easier one, but we do have the free will to choose. Even the grace that comes after is not free, and this week in particular, Christians commemorate its high cost. (Celebrants of today, Maundy Thursday, will recall that the night before Jesus was arrested, he also asked, rather unsuccessfully, for an extension.)
Of course, I believe extensions should be granted for students with extenuating circumstances, and it is very good that CS50 course staff have been able to look out for their students’ health outside the classroom when it impacts their academic work.
But beyond those circumstances, academic dishonesty shouldn’t be an excusable offense. Harvard should expect every student to reject it entirely, regardless of the specific conditions of their assignment. (Wonderfully, The Crimson article reporting on the new policy is paired with a photo whose caption reads, “During the first CS50 lecture, David J. Malan ’99 explains the concept of binary.”)
If academic dishonesty is indeed akin to sin—and having taken the Puritanism out of the alma mater, I suppose CS50 was as good a place as any to put it—we ought to be truer to its gravity. To commit it or to abjure it is a personal choice we must each make, as both the phrase “academic dishonesty” and the word “sin” imply.
I’m more optimistic than either Malan or the Catholics: I’m willing to believe Harvard undergrads do not have an intrinsic inclination towards cheating. I hope in the future that courses can treat them that way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging released its final report earlier this week after months of substantive discussion and analysis, providing a tremendous amount of information about many University-wide issues related to diversity and inclusion. The report is impressively thorough, and we commend the Task Force for the depth with which they have considered these weighty issues. The report’s concrete recommendations and clear-cut goals for each of the University’s respective schools are especially to be applauded.
We are pleased to see that many of the issues we have opined on recently have been referenced within the report. For example, the report’s recommendation to make spaces available within the newly-renovated Smith Campus Center to support “civil disagreement” and other forms of dialogue serve as a potential for the beginnings of a multicultural center, a weighty topic within the College in recent months.
Additionally, we commend the task force for recognizing the important issue of faculty diversity and President Faust for devoting a sizable amount of funding to ameliorating it. As we have opined, and as some students know all too well, the faculty at Harvard unfortunately do not reflect the diversity of the student body across spectrums of race, gender, religion, ideology, and more.
We believe that this lack of diversity has troubling implications for the culture of the University, and we are glad to see this increase in funding to change course. Indeed, diversification could potentially lead to academic growth—a more diverse faculty could be propitious for founding a formal Ethnic Studies department and concentration within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, something some students have been requesting for some time.
Furthermore, in the turbulent political and social context of recent months, we also find ourselves increasingly concerned with the issue of ideological diversity. The free exchange of ideas representing the multitude of views and identities found on Harvard’s campus is essential to our continued success as a university. We are pleased to see the Task Force has not left “academic freedom” out of the many ways in which the University could better facilitate inclusion, especially when it is profoundly liberal. We hope that the $10 million that President Faust has set aside for hiring new faculty members includes those who hold contrarian or marginalized political views.
Of course, focusing on ideological diversity should in no way diminish attempts to redress other perceived inequalities across racial and social lines. In receiving this report, Harvard now has to take on the difficult and nuanced job of addressing all forms of diversity on campus, and not leave any behind.
The report encourages the University to “become its best self,” for the sake of its own good and the public’s. We can only achieve this by working together to address all the ways in which individuals may feel unwelcome on our campus. This report provides a starting road map for the advocacy efforts required going forward, and we are eager to see the University take clear, active steps to respond to it. There is, after all, so much work ahead.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

It’s the first Monday of fall, 1827. You’re standing in a field called “the Delta” where Memorial Hall now stands. On one side of the field, you stand with the entirety of the freshman class. You stare down a sea of sophomores on the opposite end of the field.  Suddenly, a ball is set down in between the sides and the game begins. Your miniature armies charge at each other, every student kicking at something—anything—trying to move the ball past the wall of the other class and over the goal line.
The ball is swiftly forgotten as you watch players trip each other and desperately kick at the constantly morphing mass of players’ shins.  It’s a free-for-all now, the sophomores and freshmen locked in a physical battle.  You get socked right in the eye. Out of your good eye, you see some classmates limping away from the fight while others’ noses gush blood.
Welcome to Harvard.
The game is over now and you gather with the sophomores again, forming rings in the field.  Together you sing “Auld Lang Syne,” a song whose title translates to “for old time’s sake,” traditionally sung to commemorate both events of the past year and friendship.  You and your peers erupt into loud cheers and the crowd disperses.
You’ve just participated in the now-discontinued annual sophomore-freshman football game.
***
Described by a New York magazine as akin to “a Spanish bull-fight,” this competition of wills between the sophomore and freshman classes dates back to the late 18th century.
The clash began in the late 1700s as a wrestling match. Eventually, it evolved into an early form of football, and, by 1827, the football fight was captured in a light-hearted epic poem called “The Battle of the Delta.”
American college football of the 19th century bears little resemblance to college football today.  Only kicking the ball was allowed, but as R.S. Minot (class of 1877) noted in The Advocate, kicking the ball was “almost impossible” and running with it was “little or no part of the game.” After the opening kick, the ball became nothing more than “an excuse for scrimmages, in which a man showed himself the best player who could kick best, and did most hurt to his adversaries’ shins.”
Minot denigrated this Rugby-esque ball as a “degraded soulless mass,” one often arbitrarily replaced by “paper, old rags, dead leaves, or anything that came handy.”  This form of football, as described by J.K. Hosmer (class of 1855), comprised “an artless game without elaborate hard and fast rules” that would likely be unrecognizable to football fans today.
The belligerence of the tradition drew criticism.  Notably, Harvard Magazine’s June 1858 issue asserted that students, while playing, were “in that state of irresponsibility and uncontrol which has been the parent of so much evil in the world… few things are more deplorable than to see God’s image mauled and beaten.”
President Cornelius Conway Felton stated that he, Harvard faculty, and Harvard Magazine all agreed that the annual tradition was a form of hazing. Under pressure from parents, the Faculty voted to ban the sophomore-freshman game on July 2, 1860.  While informal games on the Delta were allowed, the decree sparked protest within the sophomore class of 1863.
In an act of defiance, the sophomores held a funeral procession for football. The mourning included torch-carrying, drum-beating, and spade-bearing.  Six pallbearers carried a coffin containing “a foot ball with painted frill.”
According to John Langdon Sibley (class of 1825), the students formed a circle once the procession stopped at the Delta. The coffin was passed around, and students took turns paying their last respects to the hallowed “degraded soulless mass.”
Meanwhile, the spade bearers began to dig the football’s final resting place. Students even made an inscribed headstone and footstone for the occasion. By the light of the torches, the elegist gave a mock-sanctimonious address, reminiscing about “noses wonderfully distended, of battered shins, the many chance blows anteriorly and posteriorly received and delivered, the rush, the STRUGGLE, the VICTORY!”
As recounted by Sibley, the students’ lamentations, which “might have been heard for a mile,” punctuated the oratory. Finally, the mourners sung to the tune of “Auld Lang Syne”: “Shall 63 submit to see / Such cruel murder done, / And not proclaim the deed of shame? / No! Let’s unite as one!”
***
The tradition of the interclass fight on the first Monday of each new academic year was not quashed by the Faculty’s vote in 1860. Instead of calling the annual event a “game,” students began to call it “rush.” Without a football, the fight continued on until 1917—but it was held at night, to avoid proctors. Students began to wear masks to conceal their identity and to avoid suspension.
In these days, the game earned the title “Bloody Monday,” as the violence persisted even without goal lines or a ball.
These renewed sophomore-freshman clashes of the early 1900s earned the attention of the New York Times. The Times produced headlines that read like Onion articles: “CLASS RUSH AT HARVARD. Sophomores Win Annual Event of Bloody Noses and Torn Clothes” and “ANNUAL RUSH AT HARVARD. Victorious Freshmen Celebrate by Stopping Trolley Cars and Tying Up Traffic for an Hour.” According to one article, students in 1903 assaulted Harvard Square storefronts with a blitz of eggs. Clearly, the annual “rush” did not end without celebratory pandemonium.
What was the appeal of this chaotic tradition? The elegist of the 1860 football funeral encapsulates the annual match’s value: the “enthusiastic cheers,” “the singing of ‘Auld Lang Syne,’” and “each student grasping a brother’s hand.”

It was a dirty business. Of course, we didn’t mind—I guess at some point we gave up on preserving the color of our sneakers. Mud was our currency and the woods provided endless cash flow.
Our city is divided into quadrants, with the park nestled in the middle of the northwest. Two thousand acres felt infinite back then. The innumerable trails intertwine like veins, or coalesce into clearings framed by knotted maples and ferns.
Every so often, a smudge of blue or yellow chalk designated the sanctioned paths. Those weren’t for us. We preferred to forge our own, crossing the glimmering creek like a game of hopscotch and shouting into the aqueducts just to measure the strength of Mother Nature’s echo.
My best friend Katia, who lived just six houses over, usually led the way. I tended to have my eyes on the sky. Once, we brought my dog along, and he took off diving into the creek. We ran in, the water licking us clean with mud as we waded under the bridge to find a tributary we had yet to explore. Katia looked at me.
“We’re entering the deep, deep woods,” she warned. Then a pause. “Let’s go.”
There was an unspoken divide, invisible lines we crossed and continued to cross. We must have had some lingering fear of the unknown, which was tied up with our thirst to dive deeper and drink in every sun-flecked atom of the land that felt like ours.
We eventually marked our territory more deliberately. Up a slope of clay and fallen leaves, we nestled behind a gargantuan oak and perched under a shelter of abandoned plywood. Fashioning slingshot arsenals out of twigs and rubber bands, we met our matches on a torrid afternoon in the summer. The boys thought they owned this spot—we knew who really did.
When we walked with our parents or pets, the world’s immensity would press our feet into the mossy ground. But when we were in the woods alone, things suddenly seemed small. Every time the ice crunched under our gravity, every time the lamb’s ears seemed to shiver in the heavy air—it murmured allegiance to some unseen force, the same one that pushed our grimy limbs always forward through the brush.
One day we forayed into our neighbor’s backyard at the edge of our cul de sac. It was the same place where I got my first bee sting and had to hold a bag of frozen peas on my knee for what felt like hours. We slunk through the weeds until we reached the checkpoint: a looming hedge that shadowed a hollow center where we plotted.
The adjacent neighborhood was enemy territory. Not the boys this time—we called the invisible adversaries vampires or devils, but it wasn’t the fear of evil or harm that propelled us onward. It was the exhilaration of being where the unexpected was expected. Day after day, we carved our path through no man’s land.
Ducking under cherry blossoms and darting through alleys, we came to a barricade of ivy and vines. Katia insisted what was on the other side of the trees was familiar. It wasn’t. We found ourselves waiting by the side of the road; beside us, a tall stranger sat in a red pickup truck on the phone with our parents. Soon we were back in the barracks, nursing shame and grounded for two weeks.
They said never again, but it was out of our hands. We had become the mud that caked our shins, clay to be molded into bodies that would last.
This summer I went back. I walked under the beeches with bark that peels like yellowed pages of manuscripts older than we are. We never did carve our names into one like we said we might.
I allowed myself to get lost, the paths I knew giving way to others that seemed to bend toward a twin world. Each footfall brought a glimpse of our past, like the time we sat in the cool solace of the rhododendron and found a home. Like the time my dog disappeared, chasing a deer for stretches upon stretches of brambles and burrs. Like the time we picked green onions and made them into a bland soup. Like the time we ran from the bucks that stared, eyes like mirrors, encountering us encountering them. Like the time my brother found a coyote skull by the side of the path.
My dog limps now; as he charges forward in search of the murky creek, he favors his right side ever so slightly. But every time I free him into the dappled shade, he runs until he can’t and stands, looking back at me. The woods still cradle him in their solid embrace. I step forward and wait to be made whole.

Pitbull’s classic adage is a pithy one: “Ask for money—get advice.” Yet the following line undermines his own argument, radically inverting the money-advice paradigm: “Ask for advice—get money twice.” As the summer months creep closer, FM is looking to pursue the aphorism’s latter course. Here are some study abroad tips from Pitbull—or, at least, the tips we imagine he’d give. Who could be better qualified to offer recommendations on navigating credit transfer, CARAT, and culture shock than Mr. Worldwide himself? Dale!
FM: Thanks so much for joining us today Pitbull; we appreciate you sparing a moment to chat with us.
Pitbull: Y’all call it a moment; I call it life.
FM: Right, uh sure, well I suppose we ought to dive right in. Can you tell us a bit about how you acquired your reputation as the globetrotting Mr. Worldwide?
Pitbull: Of course. What you have to understand is that I don’t play football, but I’ve touched down everywhere. Likewise, I don’t play baseball, but I’ve hit a home run everywhere. I’ve been to countries and cities I can’t pronounce and places on the globe I didn’t know existed.
FM: I see. Well many Harvard students hope to do the same this summer and throughout the coming semesters. Can you tell them a bit about how you navigate cultural differences abroad?
Pitbull: First and foremost, when it comes to navigating intercultural interaction in the international context, let me tell you what we gon’ do: two plus two, I’m gon’ undress the implicit assumptions I hold about “the other.” Then we’re gonna go three and three; you gon’ undress your assumptions about Americans and their actions on the international stage. Then we’re gonna go four and four; we gon’ embrace our role as citizen ambassadors in our rapidly globalizing world.
FM: Wow, you’ve developed quite a system.
Pitbull: For sure. You see, it’s not easy to balance my two identities: Mr. Worldwide and Mr. 305. The codeswitching inherent to life as both an international music icon and a Miami native requires an acute intercultural literacy.
FM: Changing tack a bit here, Harvard tries its best to make international experiences accessible to all students, regardless of their financial circumstances, yet sometimes funding sources can be hard to identify and the CARAT system difficult to navigate. How do you live a thrifty lifestyle while travelling?
Pitbull: I totally relate; I really do. You see, I knew my rent was gon’ be late ‘bout a week ago; I worked my ass off, but I still can’t pay it though. When it comes to financial concerns, it’s important to recognize that time is money—only difference is I own it. (he pauses) What I think I’m trying to say is that often it’s better to just stop time and enjoy this moment… I see the future, but I live for the moment. Make sense, don’t it?
FM: Wow, that’s quite profound. Thanks again for talking with us today. Any final words for Harvard students leaving Cambridge?
Pitbull: Yeah-eeah-eeah-eeah. Don’t stop the party. Dale.

Although no one listed any prerequisites on the MIT BitCoin Expo website, we find ourselves woefully unprepared when we show up at the conference, facing the thick, turbid jargon that is computer science.
“I don’t know what the hash rate of BitCoin is going to be in the future,” laughs Karl S. Floersch, a computer developer. “But Proof of Stakes is preferable to Proof of Work because Proof of Work has a lower scale of the chain and overpays the miners!” he continues, flailing his arms passionately.
Over the course of its two day conference, the MIT BitCoin Club fills 17 hours with this kind of debate, lectures, and scintillating conversations about the Proofs of Replication for Decentralized File Storage Networks. In other words: an English concentrator’s worst nightmare. But for the coders, hackers, and computer geniuses who attend the event, it’s heaven. Or at least something extraordinary.
“This is a revolution we are watching,” says Sahil Sachdev, a member of the MIT BitCoin Club and a co-organizer of the expo. “The people who are here, they care about the true value of this revolution.”
To the uninitiated, BitCoin has been a relatively quiet revolution. There are certainly news blips and lots of nebulous excitement, but when’s the last time you actually used a BitCoin? Unless you’re near a KFC in Canada, good luck trying to find a place to spend all that cryptocash—for the moment, most places still won’t take it.
Hurdles aside, BitCoin has garnered quite a following since becoming popular around 2013. Hardcore devotees convened this March at the MIT BitCoin Expo 2018, and they came in droves. According to Sachdev, this year’s expo drew almost “1,000 times” the number of attendees as 2017’s event, mostly due to better advertising and organizing.
Flying in from as far away as Kenya or Belarus, participants attend the conference’s Hackathon, Pitch Competition, and “Women’s Event,” a happy hour celebrating the regrettably elusive Woman in Computer Science. (Men were also there.) According to Parul Vakani, the happy hour comprises the club’s attempt to counteract the gender imbalance in the nearly 70 speakers from MIT and beyond.
The Hackathon awards ceremony ends up being one of the most lively events of the conference. For the competition, around 130 teams spent 24 hours cooped up in the Ray and Marie Stata Center, working on original code that optimizes the use of BitCoin. The winners are presented with giant checks, provided by the expo’s sponsors. Winning Teams include “BitCoin Academy,” “ProxyChat,” and our favorite, “Game of Loans.” Their skill with IPFS (interplanetary file system) is rivaled only by their skill with puns.
One group, ProxyChat, takes home a $5,000 check for their decentralized chatting application. According to the co-coders from Boston University, Ezequiel Gomez and Omar H. Sagga, their decentralized chat program—birthed in under 24 hours—uses a proxy to encrypt text so it’s only readable to a specific recipient. It utilizes code developed by one of the expo’s sponsors, NuCypher, who also sponsored the $5,000 reward.
It sounds pretty serious, but Gomez and Sagga assured us it was no biggie. “We registered three days ago,” they say. “We mostly wanted the T-shirt, anyways.” Not the $5,000.
To be honest, at a BitCoin Expo, maybe that makes sense—who needs $5,000 when the crypto-revolution is all but upon us? They say it themselves at the expo. One group disdainfully looks at the check presented to them: “We don’t do checks anymore, that’s obsolete technology.” The checks of the future will probably be in BitCoin, anyway.
The cultish veneer of the crypto community belies passionate conflict over the direction of cryptocurency’s future. According to Nick C. Ayton, Founder of Chainstarter and self-described “rampant libertarian,” many established financial institutions, including investment banks and venture capitalists, misrepresent cryptocurrency’s revolutionary potential to their own benefit. He says “there is a lot of funny business out there and the agents of Satan are behind it.” He disagrees with the strategy pursued by traditional investors, which cares less about the strength of the ideas than it does about the ability of a team to accomplish them.
Despite these barbed comments over the trillions of dollars sloshing around the crypto market, no blood is shed at the MIT BitCoin Expo. At the end of his debate, Floersch looks apologetically to his opponent. “Let’s all love and be nice to each other. I’m sick of this debate, to be honest. Let’s hug.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80, a member of the Board of Overseers—the University’s second highest governing body—called on Harvard to divest from fossil fuels Wednesday afternoon, marking the first time any member of the University’s governance boards has urged divestment.
Taylor is the co-founder and CEO of Beneficial State Bank, a California-based community development bank. She was elected to the Board of Overseers by Harvard alumni in 2012; her term will end this May.
In an op-ed published by The Crimson on Wednesday, Taylor called for University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard Management Company—the investment branch in charge of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—to “adopt ethical investment principles.”
“At a minimum, Harvard should direct the Harvard Management Company to divest from fossils fuels to prevent the end of life as we know it through cascading climate-driven disasters,” Taylor wrote. “This single act would not only take steps to address the existential crisis of our time, but it would allow the University to lead its peers, as few, if any, American universities thus far have taken this important moral stance.”
In a conference call Wednesday, Taylor said she has “exhausted all other avenues available to me as a sitting member of the Board of Overseers.” Taylor said she has used diplomatic measures with other members of the Board, talked to Harvard administrators, and asked the Board to consider advisories to the President regarding fossil fuel investment.
“We have called on the University to divest from all climate-destabilizing actions, including fossil fuel investment,” Taylor said. “Regrettably, these voices have been dismissed by Harvard’s leadership at every turn, sometimes with judgment and disrespect.”
Taylor also said she believes members of the Board of Overseers see climate change as an “imminent disaster of global impact caused by man-made activities” and that a subset of the Board is “sympathetic” to her cause. But Taylor said she is “unaware” of anyone who is comfortable in going public with a request similar to hers.
The University has faced consistent pressure in recent years from faculty and students alike to divest from fossil fuels.
More than 100 Harvard faculty signed an open letter in April 2014 urging University President Drew G. Faust and the Corporation to divest from fossil fuel investments. As of Wednesday, more than 270 people have signed the letter. In March 2015, a group of 20 students stormed and occupied Massachusetts Hall— where Faust’s office space is located to demand fossil fuel divestment. And in March 2017, 20 members of the student activist group Divest Harvard blockaded University Hall to demand similar action.
Despite the mounting pressure, Faust has held firm on her stance against divesting from fossil fuels, arguing Harvard can better tackle climate change through research.
“While I share their belief in the importance of addressing climate change, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise,” Faust wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates in 2013.
Chloe S. Maxmin ’15, the co-founder and CEO of Divest Harvard—an organization comprising Harvard students, faculty, and alumni—recounted how the movement grew exponentially over time. But she said the University did not listen.
“Harvard has lost an opportunity to be a climate leader,” Maxmin said. “Now, all it can do is follow its students, faculty, and alumni to the right side of history.”
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates in January, Faust announced the University’s plans to be fossil-fuel free by 2050. Faust did not discuss the University’s stance on its fossil fuel investments at the time.
In an emailed statement Wednesday, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote that,  while the University agreed with Taylor on the issue of climate change, it “respectfully disagreed” on the methods for tackling the issue.
“Kat Taylor has long made her support for divestment known to colleagues on the governing boards.  Her individual opinion is respected and welcome, as are the diverse views of people across our community. We agree that climate change is one of world’s most urgent and serious issues, but we respectfully disagree on the means by which a university should confront it,” Jackson wrote.
“As an academic institution, Harvard will continue to pursue a leadership role in seeking meaningful, effective solutions to climate change through wide-ranging research, education, community engagement, and dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint,” she added.
Tim E. Wirth ’61, a former member of the Board of Overseers and former United States senator, joined Taylor’s public call for the University to act.  Wirth said he has repeatedly asked the University to consider a policy on fossil fuels along with others.
“Not only are we stonewalled, we don’t even get the courtesy of a response,” Wirth said. “The University also uses the ridiculous argument that the endowment should not be used as a political tool, as if dealing with climate change is a political issue.”

A record-low 4.59 percent of applicants to Harvard College received offers of admission to the Class of 2022 Wednesday, with just 1,962 of 42,749 candidates securing spots in the class. This year marks the first time Harvard’s admission rate has ever dipped below 5 percent.
The College notified 998 students of their acceptance in the regular decision cycle at around 7 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. These accepted students make up 2.43 percent of the total 36,119 regular decision applicants, plus the 4,882 students deferred in the early action process. The accepted regular decision students join 964 students who were offered admission through Harvard’s early action process in December.
This year’s acceptance rate is the lowest in the history of the College. Down from last year’s 5.2 percent, this year’s rate also marks the fourth consecutive year in which the percentage of admitted students has decreased. The total number of admitted students in the Class of 2022 has also decreased from last year’s 2,056.
“They are quite an amazing cohort of people because they’re coming from the widest range of economic and ethnic backgrounds in our history,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview Wednesday. 
For the first time in 10 years, a majority of accepted students are women. Women make up 50.1 percent of the admitted class, compared to last year’s 49.2 percent.
The percentage of minority admits rose across racial groups relative to last year’s levels.  A record 15.5 percent of admitted students are African American, up from last year’s 14.6 percent. Latino admits increased to 12.2 percent from last year’s 11.6 percent. Native American admits grew marginally this year to 2 percent, up from last year’s 1.9 percent. Asian American admits went up to a record 22.7 percent, compared to last year’s 22.2 percent.
These demographic shifts come amid a pending lawsuit that alleges Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies illegally discriminate against Asian-American applicants. The United States Department of Justice is currently investigating Harvard for similar allegations.
Harvard has previously denied allegations that it discriminates against Asian-American applicants, arguing a diverse set of factors contribute to its holistic application review process.
"Harvard remains committed to enrolling diverse classes of students,” Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane previously said. “Harvard’s admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the U.S. Supreme Court.”
First-generation college students make up 17.3 percent of this year’s admits, up from 15.1 percent for the admitted Class of 2021.
“We’re really thrilled to see the jump in first-generation students,” Fitzsimmons said Wednesday. “This is one of those years where I think we had some breakthroughs.”
Fitzsimmons also touted the class’s socioeconomic diversity, citing the success of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative over the past few years in making an education at the College practical for students from low-income backgrounds.
Currently more than half of students at the College receive some form of need-based financial aid. Twenty percent of families—those making less than $65,000 annually—pay nothing at all toward the cost of their student’s Harvard education.
“The doubling of the applicant pool is a measure of exactly how important financial aid is to making a case to people that whoever you are, you can afford to be here,” Fitzsimmons said.
This year, a record 20.3 percent of admits could qualify for Federal Pell grants, money allotted under a government initiative that seeks to help low-income students. Fitzsimmons said the number of admitted students eligible for these grants has doubled since the launch of the financial aid initiative in 2004 .
Students admitted to the Class of 2022 hail from all 50 states, and 90 countries around the world. International students make up 12 percent of admitted students, up from 11.4 percent last year.
This year’s admission cycle comes after a record-high 84 percent of the admitted Class of 2021 chose to matriculate. The unusually large class size forced administrators to house 28 freshmen in overflow housing.  Fitzsimmons previously said the College planned to admit fewer students into the Class of 2022 in hopes of allowing “40 to 50 to maybe 100 people” off the waitlist.
Last year, Harvard did not admit any students from the waitlist.
Fitzsimmons said the Admissions Office’s target class size is around 1,665, indicating a predicted yield of around 85 percent for the Class of 2022.
The sticker price for enrolling in the Class of 2022 will be the highest in the College’s history. The total cost of attendance for the 2018-2019 academic year will be $67,580, an increase of 3 percent over the previous year.
Acceptance letters slated to be sent to students Thursday will include an invitation to Visitas—the College’s visiting weekend for admitted students—which will run from April 21 to April 23. Students have until May 1 to accept, defer, or decline their offers of admission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quincy House and College administrators are launching a search for a new resident dean, according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
Resident deans serve as an intermediary between students in the House and the College administration. The deans play various roles, including representing students who must go before the Administrative Board, one of the College's disciplinary bodies.
O’Dair said the search for the new dean will involve soliciting input from multiple groups, including Quincy House affiliates, University Health Services, and Counseling and Mental Health Services.
“The search process for resident deans,” O’Dair wrote in an emailed statement, “typically involves Faculty Affairs, members of the house (students, tutors), the faculty deans, and campus partners like UHS and CAMHS.”
Before the College extends an offer for the position, finalists for resident dean positions are typically invited to tour the House with the Faculty Deans, House administrators, and students, along with staff from the Office of Student Life and the Campus Services department. Once appointed, resident deans serve renewable five-year terms, according to O’Dair.
Judith Flynn, the outgoing Quincy resident dean, declined to comment via email.
The title of the resident dean position has changed four times in the past decade. In Dec. 2017, the College changed the name of the position from “assistant dean” to “resident dean,” citing confusion over the former term.
“The resident deans, former Allston Burr Assistant Deans, reported to me that their title was confusing to students, and so they asked that it be reverted back to the former title,” O’Dair said in December.

With just months left in Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign, the school has met its $600 million financial aid goal, according to donor Michael T. Kerr ’81.
The campaign, which publicly launched in Sept. 2013, surpassed its $6 billion goal in 2016 and had raised more than $8 billion as of June. Even as the overall campaign shattered higher education fundraising records, as of January, it had yet to meet the College’s financial aid goal.
At an event for scholarship donors and recipients in New York City in January, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd R. Blankfein ’75, and Class of 2016 senior class gift marshall Kia C. Turner ’16 made the case for financial aid.
As the campaign neared its finish line, donors stepped up to close the gap.
“We have achieved the target of $600 million,” Kerr said in an interview this week.
University representatives informed a group of donors about the milestone at a meeting two weeks ago, Kerr said.
Fundraising around financial aid got off to a strong start early in the campaign, when Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 gave a $125 million gift in Feb. 2014—the largest donation the College had ever received at the time, which funded hundreds of scholarships.
The University has not yet announced the specific gifts that helped the campaign reach its goal, but two alumni familiar with the matter say they expect an announcement in April.
Kerr said donors and some financial aid recipients will celebrate the financial aid campaign’s success at an annual dinner called “Celebration of Scholarships” on April 13 at the Northwest Building. He called the event “one of the finest nights we do for alumni on campus.”
Back in January, some alumni said they had been surprised that this particular benchmark had yet to be reached.
Roy G. Geronemus ’75, who has funded scholarships at the College for the past 15 years, said in January he was surprised the financial aid drive was lagging behind.
“I would have assumed that they would have been further along in obtaining the support that they need to give Harvard students whatever is necessary,” he said.
Around 70 percent of Harvard students receive some form of financial aid, while 20 percent of students are on full scholarships.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment on whether the campaign had met its financial aid goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Approximately 100 Harvard students sat down with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at Institute of Politics fellow Scott Jennings’s off-the-record study group on Wednesday afternoon.
During his short visit to campus, McConnell also met with Harvard administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf, and IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, according to Jennings.
“Frankly, he shook a lot of hands today. He got a real good sort of education about what’s going on at the Kennedy School, and what’s going on at Harvard in general,” Jennings said.
McConnell was persuaded to take a trip to Harvard by “a fortunate confluence” of  “happy involvement over the years, my being here, and what I’d like to think was a persuasive invitation,” Jennings said.
Jennings, who held senior positions in McConnell’s campaigns in 2002, 2008, and 2014, said he has actually known McConnell since 1995, when Jennings was a high school junior participating in a leadership program with McConnell’s daughter.
“It was an honor to have him on campus,” he said. “It will definitely be the most special moment and memory that I take away from my fellowship here.”
Wednesday did not mark the first time McConnell and Faust have sat down together. During her presidency, Faust has traveled to Washington several times to meet with McConnell and other top lawmakers. Faust recently publicly called on McConnell to repeal the newly passed tax on university endowments and to keep protections for undocumented immigrants.
Jennings declined to comment on what McConnell discussed with administrators Wednesday.
Wednesday formed McConnell’s first time speaking at an Institute of Politics event, according to Emily M. Hall ’18, who helps organize Scott Jennings’s IOP study groups. McConnell’s wife—Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, a graduate of the Business School—served as a senior advisory board member of the IOP from 2002 until accepting her cabinet position.
McConnell’s talk with students at the study group, which took place at the Malkin Penthouse at the Kennedy School, was a closed event. Students had to enter a lottery for a chance to win one of the available seats.
“It was the right call to lottery,” Hall said. “There’s a lot more interest than we have space.”
Jennings called McConnell’s visit the “crown jewel” of his study group outline.
“One of the most satisfying things to me was there were several students from Kentucky, including a couple of people who went to his high school alma mater in Louisville,” Jennings said. “And they’re now students at Harvard.”
One of the goals of the IOP study groups, Hall said, is to provide students with unique opportunities to engage with political figures “in a really close setting, which is something that we don’t often get.”
“I got the chance to talk to him one-on-one. He went around the room during the reception beforehand and when he was signing books. So I got to talk to him a bit about Alaskan politics,” Kiera E. O’Brien ’20, president of the Harvard Republican Club, said. “I just really appreciated his candor. ”
Catherine H. Ho ’21, who attended the event, said she thought many of the questions Jennings posed while he was leading the discussion were “things that people have asked” in the past.
“If you’re going to make it ‘off-the-record,’ I expect the conversation to be a lot more robust and candid,” Ho said.
Ho said she wished more time had been dedicated to student questions. “There were so many questions left to be answered,” she added, noting there were still many raised hands when the last question was called.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said he thinks it is important to note the event was not a forum for students to challenge speakers, but was “largely supposed to be an instructive model.”
“The idea is about teaching people about experiences in politics,” he said. “In that way, even though I disagree with almost everything Mitch McConnell stands for, I still think that there is something I can learn about his experience.”
Ho and Freeland both said there were students from across the political spectrum present in the room.
“If anything stood out to me today, it was the ability to have civil discourse on campus between students of all political ideologies,” Freeland said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 29, 2018 at 9:12 p.m.
A group of Harvard Law students and alumni are urging Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 to make a number of changes to the school’s Low Income Protection Plan, which helps graduates who go into public service and other low-paying legal careers repay their loans.
The group, called the Coalition to Improve LIPP, published an open letter to Manning in the Harvard Law Record Monday proposing five changes to the program in order to “empower HLS graduates of all backgrounds to pursue the careers of their choosing.”
The coalition’s open letter Monday outlines five specific policies the coalition has asked the Law School to review, including “improving the participant contribution scale,” increasing transition time for students moving between jobs, improving family leave and dependent care policies, doing away with the cap for undergraduate borrowing, and removing the cap for retirement asset protections.
The Coalition to Improve LIPP has been working since the fall semester to address grievances they identified with the program based on conversations with alumni, research into loan repayment programs at other schools, and a survey of law students.
LIPP aims to assist eligible students in repaying loans by asking students to repay a portion of their student loans based on their income. The Law School then pays the remaining amount. Around 700 graduates are currently enrolled in the program, according to Kenneth Lafler, the school’s Assistant Dean for Student Financial Services.
The Law School’s public interest programs have generated debate at the school in recent months. Many of the concerns the Coalition to Improve LIPP raises in the letter were first voiced in a separate letter sent to Manning last October. More than 175 Harvard Law students and alumni signed onto that letter, which claimed the program is not on par with loan repayment programs at other law schools like Yale and Stanford.
In a statement, Lafler wrote LIPP offers more benefits and flexibility in career choice to Harvard Law graduates than comparable programs offer.
“Compared to similar programs at many schools, LIPP covers a broader range of jobs and provides benefits that are not contingent on a long-term commitment to a specific type of work,” Lafler wrote.
The coalition attached a document to the Monday letter that explains each of their proposals, outlining alternative contribution scales and allowances graduates receive for having a child, among other details.
“We are committed to making Harvard Law School more financially accessible... making it possible for students to pursue the careers that they want to pursue,” Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, president of the Coalition to Improve LIPP, said in an interview Wednesday.
Sara R. Fitzpatrick, a first-year Law student who serves as policy director for the coalition, said it’s important that graduates from underprivileged backgrounds are able to pursue careers that serve people in their communities.
“What we see as a problem [is] where people aren’t able to go back into the communities that they come from and the only people that are able to do public interest are often people who came from privileged backgrounds and may not understand as well the issues that those communities face," she said.
Coalition members met with Manning on March 9 to discuss their proposals. After that meeting, members drafted the letter and approached other student groups in order to gauge interest in their recommendations.
Several student organizations, including the Law School’s student government, the Women’s Law Association, and the Black Law Students Association, signed onto the letter.
Paavani Garg, a third-year Law student and president of the Harvard Women’s Law Association, wrote in an emailed statement that changes to LIPP would advance gender equality.
“Women tend to go into public interest jobs more so than private sector and therefore are largely influenced by LIPP,” Garg wrote. “The current program implicates matters such as maternity leave, transition time, career choices, retirement savings—all topics that are implicated in conversations about gender equity.”
The Student Government for Harvard Law School also signed the letter. Amanda M. Lee, president of the Student Government, wrote in an emailed statement that the organization voted “unanimously” to sign the letter in support of the policy changes.
“After hearing about the Coalition to Improve LIPP's efforts to improve the program, our Student Government council members present voted unanimously to sign on to the letter,” Lee said. “We are proud to support the Coalition's student advocacy, especially as it was done in conjunction with and informed by alumnae who have been living on LIPP and have brainstormed many ways in which LIPP can be improved.”
Lafler wrote in a statement that he has met with the coalition several times and that the Law School’s Financial Aid Committee is considering the issues they have raised.
“LIPP is the cornerstone of the Law School’s commitment to career choice,” Lafler wrote. “I have had many constructive meetings over the past several months with the students in the Coalition to Improve LIPP. The issues they raise are important and deserve careful consideration, and the Financial Aid Committee is engaged in that process right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: March 29, 2018 at 5:08 p.m.
When allegations of sexual harassment against a prominent Government professor roiled campus last month, Harvard joined a growing list of universities across America embroiled in similar scandals—and saw direct effects of the #MeToo movement for the first time.
The #MeToo campaign launched in Oct. 2017 when the New York Times reported allegations that film executive Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed or abused dozens of women—ranging from actresses to staffers—across decades. The backlash against Weinstein precipitated a social media campaign centered around the catchphrase #MeToo, urging those who have experienced sexual misconduct to speak out.
In the following months, an avalanche of similar allegations surfaced in industries ranging from Hollywood to the restaurant business to higher education.
In Nov. 2017, the Huffington Post reported allegations of harassment against a Princeton engineering professor. In January, the New York Times reported five accounts of alleged sexually inappropriate behavior perpetrated by a Columbia photography professor. The Chronicle first reported allegations against Dominguez at the end of February.
Some higher education experts say it has taken comparatively longer for the #MeToo movement to reach academia broadly—and Harvard specifically.
“I don’t really know why it’s taken so long,” said Paula Fazli ’85, a search expert at Sage Search Partners. Fazli said she thinks one reason could be Harvard prioritizes protecting faculty members whenever possible.
“They spend a lot of time recruiting these amazing, top-of-their-field faculty [and] the whole institution’s reputation rests on having the best-of-the-best faculty and research in the world,” she said. “And their reputation, especially these days, there’s a huge risk in going public with a scandal.”
But former University provost Steven E. Hyman said he thinks it is an “error” to tie the problem of power relations or the problem of protecting tenured faculty exclusively to Harvard.
“I think academia is all hierarchical, and I think tenured faculty are protected, and I think it’s not unique to academia by any way, certainly,” he said. “I think the pattern is that people do protect each other and protect their powerful leaders both for bonds of affinity and also in these hierarchies because of fear or danger of rocking the boat.”
Fazli adds she thinks the changing cultural climate towards sexual harassment—typified by the #MeToo movement—has now made it impossible for institutions of higher learning to “push it under the rug.”
Narcisa Polonio, a former executive vice president at the Association of Community College Trustees, posited another reason the #MeToo movement may have taken longer to reach the University. Polonio said she thinks Harvard’s high profile might mean victims of sexual harassment feel reluctant to speak up.
“I think the issue here is because of the space that Harvard occupies,” she said. “Anything that’s going to happen there is going to get a lot more attention.”
University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill said Harvard administrators have worked for years to address issues of sexual misconduct, with efforts dating back to well before the #MeToo movement began.
“We are creating an environment that is inclusive, that ensures that our graduate professional students and our undergraduate students feel that they can come forward to share concerns without the risks... of retaliation, risks of reputational harm,” she said.
Merhill also said she thinks Harvard is “ahead of the curve” on issues of sexual harassment policy. She pointed to recent Title IX office initiatives including a new online training module debuted at the College two years ago, regular analysis of “patterns of concerns” across the University, and the addition—and extensive training—of over 50 Title IX Coordinators across the University in recent years.
“Harvard didn't wait and doesn’t wait to respond to issues that come about through the media,” Merhill said.
Since the establishment of the central Title IX office in 2014, the University has seen an increase every year in the number of reports of sexual misconduct across Harvard. As of Dec. 2017, complaints had spiked by 20 percent in the wake of the Weinstein scandal.
Now that allegations of sexual harassment have specifically reached a Harvard professor, Polonio thinks the landscape of sexual misconduct in academia could shift. Polonio said the University’s high profile means how it handles the Dominguez allegations could set a precedent for how higher education institutions around the country handle sexual harassment incidents.
“What Harvard does next to resolve this will serve as a template for colleges and universities all over the country,” she said. “That’s what I would hope, that Harvard rises to the occasion and really explores the very best way to set the checks and balances and mechanism to protect those women and men.”
In the wake of the allegations brought against Dominguez, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed the professor on “administrative leave.” Harvard is currently conducting a review of the charges against Dominguez, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith. Dominguez also announced he would retire from teaching at the end of the semester, and from administrative positions immediately.
Hyman and Merhill said they hope those who have experienced sexual harassment continue to come forward.
Merhill said the Title IX Office’s goal is to create an environment where students “feel comfortable coming forward to any of their coordinators or to my office to share the concern they have so we can connect them with resources.”
“What I hope is that this is not a flash in the pan, a brief moment of people telling their stories,” Hyman said. “But rather that places like Harvard and all institutions, companies, will ensure that people who have been harassed, assaulted and so forth will continue to feel safe coming forward.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 29, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Narcisa Polonio is currently an executive vice president at the Association of Community College Trustee. In fact, she no longer serves in that role.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard College Democrats released a statement Wednesday morning in support of the ongoing graduate student worker unionization effort.
The statement urged eligible students to vote “Yes” in the upcoming April 18 and 19 unionization election. The results of that election will likely determine whether qualifying graduate and undergraduate students earn the right to collectively bargain with the University as members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers.
The group’s endorsement came two days after four campus unions and two Boston-area labor groups signed and released a letter advocating for the student worker unionization effort, which has been ongoing since Harvard's  first unionization election in 2016.
“Student workers have the same problems [as other workers] like sexual assault, getting proper wages, getting healthcare, things like that,” said Nirav R. Sookhai ’21, the College Democrats’ treasurer, who said he helped organize the endorsement.
“They deserve the same rights. They deserve that union to help fight for those rights,” he said.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, president of the College Democrats, said the endorsement forms “part of our institutional planning to try to prioritize allyship on campus more.”
In 2016, the College Democrats established a new board position focused on campus outreach to further the club’s goal of supporting other student groups’ campaign efforts.
Nathaniel R. Braffman, a graduate student and supporter of the HGSU-UAW, wrote in an emailed statement that he is excited about the club’s endorsement.
“It's great to hear that the Harvard College Dems recognize our work to protect student workers from exploitation, harassment, and deportation—many of the reasons I support a union here,” Braffman wrote.
Freeland said the College Democrats will continue to discuss how to best support the union in the coming weeks.
“We want to be conscious of what our role is on campus and not make this an issue about Democrats or Republicans,” Freeland said. “It’s an issue about Harvard student workers and their needs on campus.”

Is there a new squad on the block to watch out for?
In perhaps the Harvard baseball team’s most dominant win over a strong team in over a year, the “Bad Boys” Crimson squad blew out Holy Cross, 10-2, on Wednesday night in Northborough, Mass. As of March 25, Harvard was ranked 175th on the RPI Division I baseball rankings, whereas Holy Cross, a stiff test, was ranked 108th.
After finishing its spring break trip 5-5, Harvard had to do one thing—get off to faster starts. After all, the squad was plagued all trip by early deficits that late rallies couldn’t bail them out of.
A week and a half later, the Crimson players looked to make good on their promise.
Like a loaded spring compressed for too long, Harvard (8-11) veritably launched out of the gates at the New England Baseball Complex in the Crimson’s first action since March 17, plating four runs in the top of the first inning before Holy Cross (7-11, 2-2 Patriot League) recorded an out.
“We’ve decided to establish ourselves as the ‘Bad Boys’ of the Ivy League,” said junior first baseman Pat McColl. “We came out right away and scored four runs in the first, so it was a good showing.”
Junior center fielder Ben Skinner got it started with a leadoff walk dealt by freshman righty Noah Luckenbaugh. Junior catcher Jake Allen—the team’s batting average leader—followed by drawing another free pass, and McColl made the rookie pay by lacing an RBI double to right. Sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson then characterized the game with a three-run shot in the next at-bat, his third home run of the year.
As Suddleson came around to score, the scoreboard lit up 4-0 in the visitors’ favor before most of the fans had even found their seats.
“We all dyed our hair this week, being the bad boys that we are,” said sophomore pitcher/third baseman Hunter Bigge. “It really gave our team a lot of energy and we were able to hop on [Holy Cross] early in the game.”
Despite the wild hair colors staring at them from across the diamond, it was likely more shocking for the home team to look up at the scoreboard 15 minutes into the game.
Harvard wasn’t done scoring in the first. The squad, colorized hairdos and all, tacked on three more runs in the third inning on RBIs from junior outfielder P.J. Robinson, senior second baseman Matt Rothenberg, and Allen, running away to an early 7-0 lead. The Crimson stretched its lead to 10-0 before Holy Cross scored twice in the bottom of the ninth, though the game was already headed towards the deep freeze.
Harvard’s ability to keep the pressure on and safeguard the lead may have been just as important as its ability to surprise the Crusaders early in the game.
On the mound, freshman righty Buddy Hayward, already a two-time Ivy League Rookie of the Week this season alone, got the start. The two-way player out of Plantation, Fla. tossed two innings and struck out three, walking one and giving up no runs.
“[Buddy] came out with some zip right away,” McColl said. “It’s definitely nice to have a big freshman like him who can pitch as well as hit.”
Six different Crimson pitchers worked relief innings to back Hayward up. Sophomore righty Grant Stone picked up the win after pitching clean third and fourth innings. The seven pitchers combined for 11 strikeouts of Crusader batsmen.
One player even made his collegiate pitching debut, despite having played 64 career games in a Harvard jersey. Junior John MacLean, an outfielder by trade, pitched for the Crimson for the first time in the seventh inning. MacLean looked like a veteran, striking out two batters in an efficient 1-2-3 inning.
“Johnny made his pitching debut on the mound and absolutely shoved,” McColl said.
MacLean, however, left it to his teammates to power the offense last night. McColl led the way with a three-for-six day at the plate, punching in three RBIs and scoring a run. Suddleson joined him in the run-producing category with his three-run first-inning bomb.
Skinner, continuing his season’s good form, got on base four times as the leadoff man and scored thrice. Rothenberg went two-for-three with a walk and a run scored. Bigge drew two walks, one of them plating a run in a bases-loaded situation.
Harvard, after seeing its games postponed last weekend against Princeton, which would have been the Ivy League kickoff, will next see action at Columbia on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its first top-ranked opponent in head coach Chris Wojcik’s eight years at the helm, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team traveled to Albany, N.Y., on Wednesday night to square up against the No. 1/1 Great Danes. The game began with a steady defensive effort for the Crimson, as the visitors were able to hold the nation’s most proficient scoring offense to just four goals through the first two quarters.
The problem, however, was that Harvard only managed two scores in that same time frame. And before it could stage a true upset attempt, Albany took control of the contest with five goals in the third, never looking back.
The Great Danes tallied a comprehensive 14-6 victory as the final result, while the Crimson recorded its lowest scoring output since netting only five against Penn during the 2014 season. Albany (9-0, 2-0 America East) continues its dominant run atop the polls and remains perfect on the season, while No. 19/RV Harvard leaves the Empire State with its six game win streak abruptly ended.
“We knew it would be a challenge tonight and credit to Albany for playing a very complete game,” Wojcik said. “There were definitely areas of our game that were lacking, though, and we’re obviously disappointed in the result.”
The Crimson entered Wednesday’s matchup with the nation’s 11th ranked scoring offense, but just over a week after putting up 19 on the board against Boston University, it could not find a way to keep up with the Great Danes. The first two quarters turned out to be the worst offensive half for Harvard all season, as the visitors mustered just 12 shots and two goals.
Sophomore attackman Kyle Anderson provided a moment of excitement when he scored in a man-down situation midway through the first quarter, but that goal would be the only one for the Crimson in those opening 15 minutes. Senior long stick midfielder Robert Mencke tacked on another with 2:58 to go in the second quarter to cap all of Harvard’s scoring in the first half.
“We had to do a better job of giving ourselves a chance on offense,” Wojcik said. “We played well on defense and at the face-off X for stretches that game, but our sloppiness with the ball and poor shooting really cost us.”
Winning possession on face-offs was certainly a positive for the Crimson, as the trio of junior James Sullivan, freshman Kyle Massimilian, and freshman Steven Cuccurullo managed to win eight out of 24 face-offs against the nation’s top face-off man, TD Ierlan. Ierlan had entered Wednesday with an 84 percent win percentage at the X, and for comparison, won every single one of his 24 face-offs against Cornell a few weeks ago.
Harvard also contained Albany senior attackman Connor Fields, the top point scorer in the country, to just one point before Fields had to exit with an injury in the third quarter. The senior, who entered the game with 7.1 points per game to his name, had two turnovers.
“We did a good job of limiting his impact on the game before he went out,” Wojcik said. “But they have a lot of guys who can hurt you and that showed in the third quarter.”
In Fields’ place, freshman attackman Tehoka Nanticoke, the No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2017, tallied two goals and four assists to lead all players with six points. Alongside him, seniors Justin Reh and Kyle McClancy each recorded a hat trick, combining for three goals in the third quarter alone to put the Great Danes firmly in the driver’s seat.
On the other side, Crimson talisman Morgan Cheek had trouble solving Albany senior goalie JD Colarusso. Despite putting up a game-high 12 shots over the course of the contest, Cheek found the back of the net on just two of them. Anderson also finished with two goals on eight shots, in what turned out to be a difficult shooting night for the visitors.
“[We have] a lot to work on,” Wojcik said. “We’ll take the weekend to regroup and make sure we’re ready for the rest of Ivy play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Junior Ryan Donato might have closed the book on his time with the Harvard men’s hockey team, but he continues to earn NCAA accolades. On Thursday, Donato, now with the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League, was named a top-three finalist for the Hobey Baker Memorial Award, given to the country’s top men’s college hockey player.
Donato stepped into the role of top-line center in the 2017-18 season, and fit in as the team’s top offensive piece. At the end of the regular season, Donato (29 GP, 26–17—43) led the Crimson in points and the NCAA in goals per game (0.90). The ECAC Player of the Year also traveled to Pyeongchang, South Korea, with the United States Olympic team, pacing the squad in goals (5 GP, 5–1—6).
Once Harvard’s season ended, Donato took his talents to the Boston Bruins, signing a two-year entry-level contract with the team that drafted him 56th overall in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. Just days after the Crimson’s elimination, he suited up for the Bs, playing against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Mar. 19. Numerous Bruins injuries gave Donato the chance to debut on the team’s second line, and he made the most of the opportunity, scoring a goal and registering two helpers. In six games for his hometown team so far, Donato has notched three tallies and two assists.
When it comes to the three finalists, however, Donato is not the only one with an NHL contract. Both Denver’s Henrik Borgström (40 GP, 23–29—52) and Northeastern’s Adam Gaudette (38 GP, 30–30—60) have signed with pro teams, the Florida Panthers and Vancouver Canucks, respectively. However, neither has made his professional debut yet.
Gaudette, a junior, led the country in goals and netted a hat trick to power the Huskies to their first Beanpot championship in 30 years. He and Donato are both South Shore natives—Gaudette is from Braintree, while Donato calls Scituate home. Borgström, a sophomore and a native of Helsinki, Finland, led the National Collegiate Hockey Conference in points and was awarded the NCHC Player of the Year.
Donato is the fifth Harvard player to be named to the Hobey Hat Trick, as the group of finalists is called. Each of the four previous Crimson finalists won the award eventually, though it took multiple nominations for some. Harvard has seen a Hobey winner very recently—at the end of the 2015-16 season, former co-captain Jimmy Vesey ’16 capped off a memorable collegiate career with the award, winning it in his second year as a nominee.
Previous Crimson winners are Mark E. Fusco ’83, former captain Scott M. Fusco ’85-86, and former captain B. Lane MacDonald ’88-89. These four former players give Harvard the only ECAC school with Hobey Baker awardees, and only Minnesota-Duluth has more winners (5). Whether or not the Crimson will tie that record remains to be seen, as the Hobey Baker winner will be named on April 6 during the Frozen Four.

Sections

We all have those people that we would rather not run into, whether it is because you have sat next to them in section for the past three months without learning their name or because you had a particularly unforgettable but unfortunate experience with them. Now that you have decided you can no longer see this person anymore, they suddenly pop up everywhere in your life, including the most important time of the day—meal time. Here are some tricks you can use to avoid them in the dining hall.
Eat at different times
You may have noticed that they get breakfast at 9, lunch at noon, and dinner at 6 everyday. However, many people spend a lot of hours in the dining hall. One way to get around this is to bribe the dhall staff to let you eat at other times. Breakfast at 6 a.m., Lunch at 11, and dinner at 3:30 are guaranteed to be times when you won’t see them— in fact, you probably won’t see anyone. Enjoy the solitude while thinking about how glad you are to avoid awkward eye contact for those three seconds.
Have your friends protect you
True friends always have your back, and they should help you to spot and avoid anyone in the dining hall. For optimal protection, have your friends form a pod around you and shield you anywhere you go, Secret Service-style. Bonus points if your friends commit to wearing ear pieces and suits while escorting you through the line and to put your tray away.
Wear a mask to the dhall
Keep your identity a secret à la Superman by wearing a mask to the dining hall (tights and cape optional). With your new identity, you can confidently walk past the person you need to avoid without batting an eye. Just make sure that you let a few confidantes in on your secret, or the dining hall may be a lonely time.
Develop a code with the HUDS staff
HUDS workers, specifically the people swiping students into the dining hall, can be your first line of defense. Creating a code where John from Annenberg hoots like an owl whenever said person enters and distracts them would give you enough time to start planning your escape.
Hopefully, with these tips, you will never have to make awkward eye contact or small talk with that weirdo from the MQC or that friend of your roommate who you cannot stand. If these don’t work, house transfer applications are still open or a nice, relaxing gap year might do the trick to ease your dining hall woes.
