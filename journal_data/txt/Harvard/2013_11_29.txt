After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the end, Harvard had the answer.
Battling from behind for most of the game, No. 20 University of New Hampshire refused to quit, coming back from a 2-0 and then a 3-2 deficit.
But the Wildcats (7-7-1, 5-3-0 Hockey East) could not overcome the Crimson’s 41-second, two-goal outburst with just over six minutes left in the third period, and the Harvard men’s hockey team (4-5-1, 2-4-1 ECAC) came away with the victory on Tuesday night at the Towse Rink in Durham, N.H.
Heading into the third period down 3-2, the Wildcats tied it up with senior Dalton Speelman’s power-play goal. The forward was able to poke it past Harvard senior goalie Raphael Girard, squeezing it by the right post on the second shot of the possession. This was only the fourth power-play goal allowed by the nation’s third best penalty-killing unit.
Sophomore Kyle Criscuolo broke the tie for the Crimson, tallying his second goal of the game, banking the puck off the left pad of UNH netminder Jeff Wyer and into the back of the net. Junior Tommy O’Regan was credited with the assist.
“The whole game was back and forth,” Criscuolo said. “They were gaining a little bit of momentum. We tried to stick to the game plan, get pucks to the net, and on the fourth goal it went in from behind the net.”
O’Regan soon made it 6-3 with a goal of his own, sending a sharp pass from freshman Luke Esposito past Wyer to the right side of the net.
Harvard made the most of its opportunities throughout the night, while the Wildcats out-shot the Crimson, 36-21.  Girard, who is currently third in the nation with a .947 save percentage, collected 33 saves on the night.
“We wouldn’t have won the game if we weren’t in net,” Criscuolo said. “I think we all have confidence when he’s in the net—he battles. Once he makes the first save, he’s going to battle to make sure he’s in position to make the second one.”
The Crimson was able to jump out to an early lead in the first period, as Esposito and Criscuolo each scored to put Harvard up, 2-0.
A little over three minutes into the game, Esposito netted his second goal in as many contests, assisted by O’Regan, who sent a pass across the ice, right to left. After an interference penalty by UNH, Harvard took the advantage on a Criscuolo goal, as the forward was able to one-time a pass from junior Patrick McNally.
But the Wildcats soon erased this lead, scoring two goals within a minute and a half near the end of the second period. Dan Correale beat Girard stick side after a strong move to get past the Crimson defense. Grayson Dowling then made it 2-2 with a shot near the right crease that beat Girard high glove side.
Harvard knocked in its third goal soon thereafter, as freshman Alexander Kerfoot fired a shot with 1:20 left in the second period that just trickled through the legs of Wyer.
Kerfoot’s goal made it two on the night for the Crimson’s rookies, whose solid contributions bode well for the squad’s future.
“I think [playing collegiate hockey] is definitely a transition,” freshman Sean Malone said. “I think we have a lot of skill. We are just really young at this point. As we play more games and get a lot more experience, we will be better and more patient with the puck.”
McNally added an empty-net goal with just under a minute left in the game to secure the win for Harvard.
Despite the team’s 5-1 loss to Boston College in the previous game, the Crimson stuck to its game plan in its sixth contest against a nationally ranked opponent thus far this season.
“We didn’t want to stray from what we’ve been trying to do,” Criscuolo said. “The coaches have been harping on getting in front of the net. It’s tough for goalies to stop pucks when they’re coming at them from five feet and with bodies near them…[Against UNH,] when we were around the net, we made the most of our opportunities.”
The Crimson will look to use this contest to build confidence as it enters its final stretch of 2013.
“Once we settled in after the first period, our guys started to realize we are a pretty good team ourselves,” Criscuolo said. “And no matter who we are playing, we are going to fight to the end. Beating a team like UNH is big for us, so hopefully we can keep it going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sense of déjà vu swept over the Crimson bench. A large lead was once again disappearing, as the team’s cross-town rival began to storm back with an improbable comeback. Just 10 days ago, the Harvard women’s basketball team (6-1), had watched a 17-point lead get cut to just six points against Boston University, with less than six minutes to play.
Now, under the lights of the Cabot Center against a tough Northeastern squad (4-2), the Crimson was again watching as its 18-point lead turned to just a five-point difference, with only 35 seconds remaining.
But, just like last time, captain Christine Clark stepped to the free throw line, knocked down two clutch free throws, and stole the ball to secure the win, 81-74, for Harvard. The defensive effort from the Crimson was on full display Tuesday night in its sixth consecutive win, as the team forced 15 turnovers, which translated into 12 easy points.
“We came out with really good defense to start off the game and continued until about five minutes left in the half, where we started to get into foul trouble,” Clark said. “That defense built us the lead and we were able to sustain it throughout the rest of the game.”
The Achilles heel of the Crimson this season reemerged following halftime, as Harvard went cold, shooting an abysmal 0-4 out of the break. Northeastern took advantage of the Crimson’s early second-half woes, breaking out into a 8-0 run to make it a two-possession game.
The Huskies’ guard Kazzidy Stewart led the charge for the home team, as she shot 50%, including five threes to reach 25 points on the night. Guard A'Lece Mark added 19 points for Northeastern, just a shade under her season average of 19.8 points per game.
“It is just being able to sustain that intensity throughout 40 minutes,” Clark said. “Once we do that, we will be really good.”
Despite a weak start out of halftime, the Crimson’s hot shooting kept the team in the game—Harvard shot 49% on the night, while Northeastern hit just 36% of its shots. Harvard continued to force turnovers, but the team was plagued by its own sloppy play as it tallied 24 turnovers.
“They stepped up their defensive pressure in the second half, and we were caught off guard,” junior guard Ali Curtis said. “They threw a full court press at us, and we tried to break it our traditional way, but they were taking away a lot of our normal looks.”
Down 6-5 at the start, Harvard suddenly turned on the jets, waking up and breaking out on a 9-0 run and forcing a Huskies timeout only a little over five minutes into the night.
The Crimson continued to dominate the tempo and play of the game, stroking the ball 9-12 from the floor and pushing its lead to 13. Harvard also continued its trend of shooting more threes, as it was able to knock down nine from behind the arc.
“I noticed they were sitting in a zone and all of my points were off threes,” said Curtis, who shot 4-6 from deep. “We move the ball very well and a lot of possessions we had everyone touch the ball.”
With less than eight minutes remaining in the half, the Crimson had increased its lead to 14, as Curtis managed to score. Curtis would finish the night with a career-high 16 points, 11 of which came in the initial 20 minutes of play.
“Ali was great tonight,” Clark said. “She played so well and helped us handle the pressure. She knocked down some big shots and without her 16 points it would have been a much different game.”
Coming off winning Ivy League Player of the Week, junior forward Temi Fagbenle, the former Ivy League Rookie of the Year, showed once again how effective she can be when healthy, as she finished the night with her ninth double-double of the season, 12 points and 12 boards. The junior was a constant presence around the rim, helping the team outrebound the Huskies, 43-32.
Clark reminded fans why she has been Harvard’s offensive answer this season, as she dropped 15 points in the first half, to give the Crimson a 50-37 lead. The captain would finish with 28 points, tying her career-high on a night when Harvard needed it.
“[I was] knocking down a few more shots then I have in the past few games,” Clark said. “I didn’t approach the game any differently.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ANCHORAGE, ALASKA—After an unconvincing second-half effort against Colorado dealt the Harvard men’s basketball team its first loss of the season earlier this week, the Crimson suffered no such late letdown against another foe from the Centennial State. Riding the physical presence of junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi, Harvard (5-1) won its opener at the Carrs/Safeway Great Alaska Shootout, dispatching Denver (0-3), 68-60, at Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, Alaska.
Moundou-Missi, coming off a pair of strong outings against Colorado and Bryant, continued his solid form, overpowering the Pioneer defense for 20 points and eight rebounds in a setting about as far removed from Cambridge, Mass. as the United States has to offer. The Crimson looked for Moundou-Missi in the post throughout the game, as he found himself consistently matched up against smaller opponents.
“They were switching on defense, so the post was open, and we got teammates like [junior guard] Wesley [Saunders] who are going to pass you the ball every time,” Moundou-Missi said. “I thought we did a pretty good job with that.”
The Cameroonian big man was one facet in an overall dominant Harvard attack down low. The team scored 61 of its 68 points in the paint or from the foul line and only attempted three three-pointers on the night. Senior forward Kyle Casey added 10 points, and Saunders, the team’s leading scorer, penetrated and got to the rim with relative ease, finishing with 19 points and nine rebounds on 8-for-13 shooting.
Both Saunders and Moundou-Missi bulled their way past and through Pioneer defenders throughout the evening, scoring and getting to the free-throw line seemingly at will.
The Crimson also enjoyed a substantial rebounding advantage over the Pioneers, 38-23, for the game, including a 14-6 edge on the offensive glass.
“It says a lot about our guys maturing to recognize what we have in this particular matchup, in this particular game, and for us, it was trying to get the ball to the paint, get the ball inside, and get to the foul line,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Harvard now moves on to play Wisconsin-Green Bay on Friday night, the first-ever appearance by an Ivy League team in the semifinals in the 36 years the tournament has been played. The Phoenix looked impressive in topping Pepperdine, 97-89, in its first-round matchup, and its size will make it more difficult for the Crimson to impose itself physically as it did Thursday night.
“We recognize they’re a tough, physical basketball team and played very well here in their first game,” Amaker said.
After Denver scored the first five points of Thursday's game, the Crimson put together a 19-6 run to build an advantage it would retain for the rest of the game. A Casey tip-in just before the buzzer gave Harvard a 10-point lead at half, and though a Brett Olson jumper pulled the Pioneers to within four with just under 12 minutes remaining, Denver would get no closer the rest of the game.
The Pioneers, ranked second in the Summit League preseason poll, failed to capitalize on their opportunities, particularly from behind the three-point line, where they shot just 4 for 18 despite a number of open looks. In the first half, Denver was successful running its cutting offense, which yielded some wide-open looks at the rim, but better communication from the Harvard defense helped it lock down on the many Pioneer back cuts as the game wore on.
“We knew that we weren’t going to be on our side of the court in terms of having our bench help us out talking through coverages and switches,” Saunders said. “I think we kind of took it upon ourselves to talk more and really stay engaged in the game, and I think we did a really great job of that in the second half.”
Sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers was uncharacteristically careless with the ball at times, committing a season-high five turnovers and making just two of his nine field goal attempts. Co-captain Laurent Rivard was also kept quiet on his quest to break the all-time three-point shooting school record, missing his only three-point attempt of the game.
Co-captain Brandyn Curry, who played 27 minutes in last Sunday’s game against Colorado after missing the previous three contests, was not in uniform. Amaker said that his status was “very doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, and that he was out indefinitely, having “probably” aggravated his left foot injury against the Buffaloes.
