After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard entered Saturday night’s game against Dartmouth as the top free-throw shooting team in the Ivy League. By the end of the night, it had slipped both in the stats and in the standings.
After connecting on just 17 of 27 freebies in a 75-66 overtime loss, the Crimson didn’t have to look far for an explanation. As the Big Green gained momentum by scoring on four of its first five overtime possessions, captain Andrew Pusar and junior guard Jeremy Lin each converted just one of two attempts on consecutive Harvard trips to the line.
With under four minutes to go in regulation, the Crimson missed free opportunities to tie the game and close the deficit eventually erased—however briefly—by Pusar’s clutch three and Lin’s last-second layup.
The Crimson’s troubles started and ended with Lin, who entered the game shooting at an 80 percent clip from the charity stripe. Harvard’s leading scorer shot just 6-of-11 from the line Saturday.
Lin’s late-game misses both from the line and the floor betrayed fatigue, as a few of his shots just caught the front rim.
“I need to go back and work on that,” Lin, who still finished with 21 points to lead the Crimson, said of his shooting struggles.
Dartmouth didn’t have its best night at the line either—the Big Green connected on just 63.6 percent of its free throws, including three big ones as Harvard mounted its comeback in the waning minutes of regulation.
Both Lin and Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker were quick to dispel the notion that the team’s recent two-week break for exams had anything to do with its poor free throw shooting in particular or its performance overall.
“Obviously the placement of [exams] doesn’t fare well for us, but it’s not an excuse,” Amaker said. “We didn’t shoot foul shots well, we didn’t take care of the ball, and if you don’t do those things in a game like this, you’re probably not going to win.” 
BIG MAN ON CAMPUSLin ended the night as the team’s leading scorer, but junior center Doug Miller had one of his more dominant stretches in a Crimson uniform when he scored on four of Harvard’s first six second-half possessions to pull his team to within one with 16:24 to play in regulation. The junior started with a pretty spin move in the lane for an easy two, then hit two free throws after pulling down the offensive board on a missed layup from Lin.
Dartmouth star Alex Barnett followed at the other end with a tough jumper, but Miller quickly responded with two on a turnaround fall-away on the baseline. By that point, Miller’s teammates knew he was hot—on the next time down the floor, Lin found his center open under the basket for an easy lay-up.
“Doug is a hard-nosed player and he’s going to come ready to play every day,” Lin said. “We’re not surprised, but we’re very thankful for that.”
The final buzzer saw the junior finish with 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting in 17 minutes. Despite his hot hand, Miller found himself on the bench down the stretch at the end of regulation and in overtime. Amaker cited freshman Keith Wright’s success on the boards (13 rebounds) as the reason for Miller’s absence. Miller had four rebounds.
“We went with the kind of lineup that got us into overtime,” Amaker said. “We go with the lineups that are clicking for us and matching up well for us.”
Senior guard Drew Housman, who started the game alongside Miller and scored five points, was also absent during Harvard’s stretch run and played just 14 total minutes.  
OVERTURNEDWhile Barnett’s 30 points jumped off the stat sheet, another eye-popping statistic—turnovers—may have sealed the overtime contest in favor of the visitors. The Crimson committed 17 turnovers on the night, while the Big Green recorded just six.
One botched play with 1:40 to go in regulation may have been just one of those 17, but will burn in the mind of freshman guard Peter Boehm (six points). With Harvard inbounding at midcourt and trailing by three, Boehm received the ball and promptly passed it back across the midcourt line to classmate Oliver McNally. The backcourt violation ended a Crimson scoring chance before it had even begun.
“It’s disappointing some of the time, when some of the turnovers we had we didn’t feel were forced,” Amaker said. “Those are the ones that bother me the most.”
Boehm—and the Crimson—was redeemed when Harvard rallied to reach overtime on Pusar and Lin’s clutch conversions. But in the extra period, the Crimson scored just four points while committing three more turnovers.
“We had so many chances to win tonight,” Lin said. “We have no one to blame but ourselves.”—Staff writer Emily W. Cunningham can be reached at ecunning@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Costly turnovers, missed free throws, and a big game from an opponent’s star player proved to be too much to overcome for the Harvard men’s basketball team. The Crimson (9-7, 1-1 Ivy) lost a disappointing game, 75-66, to woeful Dartmouth (3-11, 1-1) in overtime at Lavietes Pavillion on Saturday night.  
Though Dartmouth had been mired in an eight-game losing streak, forward Alex Barnett poured in 30 points to lead the Big Green. During the decisive overtime period, Barnett scored six of his team’s 13 points and also added a crucial steal that stopped Harvard’s comeback attempt. In the teams’ last matchup, when Harvard won at Dartmouth 63-62, Barnett was held to only nine points. 
“We tried, as we did before, to limit his touches,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a good player and I think he got confidence. He was in a very good rhythm and there’s not much many people in our league can do once he gets going like that.” 
After trailing the entire second half, Harvard pulled ahead, 57-56, with 4:32 left to play in regulation on freshman Keith Wright’s free throw. Dartmouth regained the lead, however, and held on until junior guard Jeremy Lin tied the game at 62 apiece on a layup with two seconds remaining.  
Captain Andrew Pusar, who scored 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting in his last game against Dartmouth, also helped with a big three-pointer down the stretch that brought the Crimson to within 62-60, setting up Lin’s late heroics. Pusar finished the game with eight points and four rebounds. 
Harvard was able to force overtime despite several key mistakes, including missed shots, free throws, and even a backcourt violation out of a timeout. Unfortunately, the Crimson managed only four points in overtime against Dartmouth, who forced three turnovers and several missed shots with stingy defense in the extra period. Harvard totaled 17 turnovers to Dartmouth’s six, which led to a 19-6 advantage in points off turnovers. 
“We had some big breakdowns and deflating plays,” Amaker said. “It was tough for us in overtime, and it was just unfortunate.” 
Junior guard Jeremy Lin once again paced the Crimson with 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting. Lin also added seven rebounds, four assists, and a devastating block in the first half that brought the crowd to its feet. 
With six minutes left in the first half, Lin chased down Dartmouth’s Marlon Sanders, who was streaking on a breakaway, and swatted Sanders’ layup attempt away. 
The game was largely controlled by the Big Green after it went on a dominating 20-5 run in the first half. The run erased Harvard’s seven-point lead, its largest, which came five minutes into the game. Dartmouth was able to score, seemingly at will, with short jumpers and aggressive drives to the basket. The Crimson was left playing catch-up the rest of the way and finally fell short in overtime. 
“As a team, I think we didn’t come out with the energy that they did,” Lin said. “We missed balls, and they just played tougher than us.” 
Junior Doug Miller was the only other Harvard player to score in double-digits. He finished with 13 points and four rebounds in just 17 minutes of play. 
Forward Keith Wright had a big game on the glass with 13 rebounds, well above his 5.4-per-game average. Wright also contributed eight points. 
Though Harvard was coming off a 13-day break for finals, Amaker refused to let the break become an excuse. 
“We’re better than we played tonight,” Amaker said. “But we didn’t play as well as Dartmouth. They deserved the victory and we didn’t.” 
The loss is Harvard’s first after a historic first win over a ranked opponent, when they defeated then-No. 17 Boston College, 82-70, on Jan. 7. Harvard then beat Dartmouth in New Hampshire, which helped Lin, Pusar, and freshman Oliver McNally earn Ivy League honors last week.
The loss also marks a disappointing start to the Ivy League component of the schedule, leaving Harvard 1-1 in conference play despite playing perennial bottom-feeder Dartmouth. 
“Certainly there’s a blow to us with not having coming out on top,” Amaker said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to hang our heads and sulk about it. It will inspire us to have a good week in practice.” 
“We don’t have any excuses,” Lin added. “We need to shake it off, come back tomorrow and just get ready for the next weekend.” 
Harvard's next game is at home on Friday against Penn.—Staff writer Lucas A. Paul can be reached at lpaul@fas.harvard.edu.
