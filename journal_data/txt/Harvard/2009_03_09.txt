The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra gathers some of the most talented musicians on campus, but in their third concert of the year—performed last Friday night—there were moments when the whole seemed weaker than the sum of its parts. After a wavering start, the evening picked up with Aaron Copland’s jazzy “Clarinet Concerto,” played by Andrew P. Lowy ’09, and concluded with a sparkling performance of Hector Berlioz’s classic masterpiece “Symphony Fantastique.”The performance of the opening piece, George Enescu’s “Romanian Rhapsody”—composed in 1901, when he was only 19-years-old—exuded the propulsion and energy written into the music, but the long, exciting build-ups never seemed to completely cohere. Individual sections and musicians were adept at authentically delivering the folk tunes throughout; a theme in the flutes in the middle of the movement, backed by tight syncopations in the violins, was especially polished, as was a lush viola solo by Elizabeth C. Adams ’10.But as a whole, HRO seemed stiffer than usual. Assistant conductor Hanjay Wang ’11, in his HRO debut, balanced the sound and skillfully led the orchestra through the several tempo changes, but an emphasis on control detracted from the sense of complete abandon that would have fully realized the piece’s excitement.In contrast, the Copland concerto, led by music director James Yannatos, was fluid and evocative. Lowy played with an unfaltering purity of sound, moving seamlessly through all registers of his instrument. His intonation was magnificent, and, unlike most technically advanced performers, Lowy possessed the impressive ability to command his instrument to tell the story. From the beginning, his melodies were wandering and melancholy, impelling the listener to follow every turn.HRO Music Director Dr. James Yannatos again showed his gift for conducting concertos; the swaying strings settled delicately under the clarinet, loyal to Lowy’s nuances. After an extended solo, Lowy moved into the playful second part of the concerto, trading arpeggios with the twinkling piano and strings.  The piece finished with jazzy pandemonium, as the dialogue between Lowy and the orchestra surged to a loud, clean conclusion.“Symphonie Fantastique,” the third and final piece on the program, was written in 1830, only three years after the Beethoven’s death. While Beethoven is considered a master of symphonic composition, Berlioz, with the production of “Symphonie Fantastique,” is credited with expanding the genre’s potential. By moving its traditional structure into a freer and more dramatic form he moved classical music further into Romanticism. The piece describes the opium-induced hallucinations of a young musician who dreams of his lover and has a variety of fantastical visions, culminating in a dance of monsters and witches who attend his funeral.Yannatos and the HRO set the stage wonderfully from the outset. In the first movement, the strings achieved a dreamy sound with smooth changes of mood that placed the music in a realm of fantasy. In the beginning, there were the slightest hesitations of rhythm and intonation, but the orchestra coalesced as they moved through the movement. In the end, the airy, dreamy quality of the strings deepened beautifully into a rich sound.  The second movement, depicting a ball, was remarkable for the violins, flutes, and clarinets’ ability to glide weightlessly as if dancing with tempered passion.In the plaintive third movement, “A Scene in the Country,” the HRO moved smoothly through the shifts of emotion, enhanced by breezy strings. The fourth movement depicted the vision of the artist’s procession to his execution after killing his beloved, and the timpani, horns, and cellos led the march with tragic urgency. During the performance of the final movement, the “Dream of a Witches’ Sabbath,” one could almost feel the spirits passing through the orchestra; each instrument became part of a wild mass that unified in a furious ending, finishing the psychedelic trip, and completing another talent-filled, though not the finest, performance by the HRO.

“Think of musical comedy, the most glorious words in the English language,” director Julian Marsh says to burgeoning but reluctant star Peggy Sawyer in “42nd Street.” The Boston Conservatory’s production of this musical serves as a compelling, nearly infallible corroboration of Marsh’s lingual assessment.  The energy and sheer joy of the cast and orchestra is immediately palpable with the first rise of the curtain, revealing pairs upon pairs of synchronized tapping feet. While perhaps hewing a bit too close to the design and staging of the excellent 2001 Broadway revival, the Boston Conservatory’s production—which ran through March 8—is nevertheless an exuberant triumph on all levels.The ultimate backstage musical, “42nd Street” follows ingénue Peggy (Riley Krull) as she attempts to get a part in a new Broadway show directed by the famous director Julian Marsh (Brennan Roach). As Peggy’s celebrity grows, the career of the leading lady Dorothy Brock (Lindsey Larson) fades.  “42nd Street” is one of the great, enduring musicals, but restaging such a successful production requires immense talent from both the cast and creative staff. The cast members need to pull off the triple threat of acting, singing, and dancing, while the creative team must produce the spectacle of a classic 1930s musical without letting it seem dated. In this production, both cast and creative excel at their respective tasks. In a show where dance is the real star, the choreography must be seamless and expressive. It works well, then, that Michael Susko acts as both director and choreographer. Susko uses the whole stage in forming creative routines that hint at the Busby Berkeley origins of the show and are flawlessly integrated into the story. Even the waiters tap offstage when clearing set pieces from a restaurant scene. Particularly affecting is the tap ballet routine during the play-within-a-play performance of the song “42nd Street” by Krull. Krull exemplifies the triple threat this show demands. Her character Peggy needs to naturally stand out in a line of chorines, “specks of dust on the stage” according to Marsh, and Krull does. Her performance as Peggy is never too naïve or calculating; she strikes just the right chord of vulnerability and wide-eyed excitement. As Roach sings the show-stopping “Lullaby of Broadway,” an ode to theater and New York City, Krull’s face becomes dreamy and adoring. Her love of performing pulses through every tap of her shoe and every note of her songs.Roach’s Julian Marsh is the perfect balance to Peggy’s bubbly Broadway fever. Somewhat jaded and severe, Marsh can be an unlikable character in less capable hands, but Roach hits the exact note of susceptibility to keep his character appealing and interesting. Roach is a refreshing anomaly on stage, his gruff tones a welcome opposition to the glitz and glam and high-pitched chorus girl squeals.The only disappointment in the cast is Steven Cardona’s Billy Lawlor. While Cardona’s dancing is acceptable, his acting and singing are not suited for this role. Great songs like “Dames” and “Young and Healthy” fall flat, Cardona’s too-weak tenor voice drowned out by the lovely orchestra.The work of the fantastic ensemble sometimes suffers from technical glitches like delayed light cues, but overall their performance only adds to the dynamism of the show. In particular, Jennifer Cohen shines as Maggie Jones, a role that could read as too over-the-top but is instead played with just the right comedic timing and scene-stealing flair. Her introduction to the fantastic “Go Into Your Dance” is an absolute pleasure to behold.“Go Into Your Dance” is but one of the many winning song and dance numbers in the wonderful score. All of these big songs are treats for both the eyes and ears, accompanied by spot on tap routines and flashy set pieces designed by Janie Howland. The true delight, however, is the music under the direction of F. Wade Russo. As the production moves from hit song to hit song, the cast members’ voices remain beautiful, but the orchestra steals the show from the very start of the overture. The score has never sounded fresher or livelier.All in all, The Boston Conservatory’s “42nd Street” would make demanding director Marsh proud. Productions such as this are what give the Peggy Sawyers of the world the dream to star in a Broadway show. The chorines might be just specks of dust to Marsh, but as Peggy says: “Put all those specks together, you have something alive and beautiful that can reach out to a thousand people we’ve never seen before.”                                          —Staff writer Ali R. Leskowitz can be reached at aleskow@fas.harvard.edu.

While the Lowell House dining hall may pale in comparison to the grandeur of the world famous “Teatro alla Scala” in Milan, both can proudly boast of producing engaging opera on a grand scale. True to its billing as Harvard’s “flagship annual opera,” the Lowell House Opera (LHO) offered an impressive production of Giuseppe Verdi’s four-act masterwork “Otello” for its 71st annual show, especially considering the constraints of its venue. The LHO’s production—which runs through March 14 with a rotating cast—represents months of preparation by a small army of volunteers including Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, numerous musicians, and singers both amateur and professional, as well as a large production team. The opera was sung in Italian with English supertitles above the stage.First performed in Milan in 1887, “Otello” was Verdi’s penultimate opera and is widely considered his greatest tragedy. The work represented the great composer’s return from his first retirement and was an immediate success. “Otello” recounts the Shakespearean story (“Othello”) in which a Moorish general is convinced that his wife has become unfaithful and decides to kill her. In one of the program notes, the Stage Director notes that, “Verdi’s ‘Otello’ takes Shakespeare’s play to the next level, bringing the audience deeper into the psyches of its three central characters.”Among these characters, Andrew Young served as the propelling force for the opera’s emotional intensity in his deft portrayal of the role of Jago. His rendition of “Credo in un Dio crudel” (I believe in a cruel God) illustrated a visceral contempt for justice as the rest of the world sees it. Although his superb dramatic presence never faltered, his voice was occasionally lost amid the din of the vast, 80 person orchestra. In her portrayal of Otello’s wife Desdemona, Melynda Davis presented a polished performance that was both passionately and exquisitely sung. Davis was able to produce brilliance with her lower voice that was complemented by the fullness of her upper register. She also gave a most entrancing dramatic performance, especially in the opening of the fourth act. The title role of Otello was sung with gusto by the tenor Brian Landry, whose commanding stage presence and intensity of tone provided a compelling portrayal of the general. He did a marvelous job of conveying the rapidly changing emotions that Otello experiences over the course of the production, but sometimes these shifts were overly dramatic. His singing, which occasionally pushed his voice to its limits, was by and large an impressive performance.The production’s hero was the orchestra, under the keen direction of Channing Yu ’93. Yu was able to channel all the energy of the 80 member ensemble into moments that spanned the entire emotional spectrum—from sheer joy to complete misery. The sound produced by the orchestra was stylish, heartfelt, and on the whole, refined. Director Anna Fisher and Producer Sarah Eggleston ’07 led an artistic staff of LHO’s production that was highly commendable. Unlike some modernist opera productions—which sometimes seem too simplistic—“Otello” was a meticulously researched period production. 15th century costumes, a monstrous castle set, and even flags were featured prominently in the production. The set itself proved to be one of the production’s greatest assets. Its multitude of hiding places and doors gave the impression that the stage was much larger than the confined space of the Lowell dining hall could ever allow it to be. If only the dining hall could somehow have a loggione installed, then “Otello” would have truly rivaled a “La Scala” production.

Last Wednesday, the staff of the Oregon Daily Emerald—the daily newspaper of the University of Oregon—went on strike to protest the dubious decision of its board of directors to hire a publisher with supervisory control over the content of the newspaper. This move was recommended to the board by paid consultant Steven A. Smith.  After receiving his sage advice, the board turned around and hired none other than Stephen A. Smith, who had already written his own job description and salary. Since the strike, the board of directors has been continued publishing editions of the Emerald, filled only with stories from the Associated Press.
We are deeply troubled by the situation of the Oregon Daily Emerald. The recent decisions made by the Emerald’s board of directors threaten to undermine the independence that is essential to student journalism. 
In our current financial climate, it is difficult for a student newspaper to maintain private funding and complete autonomy over its content. Still, the actions of the board of directors are unacceptable. The board should have negotiated the conditions of the new publisher position with the students. Furthermore, producing a paper without any student content in response to the protest is an insult to the years of work that the Emerald staff has placed into their newspaper. 
Editorial independence is the pillar of an effective college newspaper, and it is clear that the independence of the Emerald would have been threatened under the arrangement proposed by the board of directors. Though Smith and the board assured the students that the publisher would not make serious changes to the content of the newspaper, giving an outside source complete supervisory control nevertheless places the editorial freedom of the Emerald’s student editors in a precarious position. 
Jeanne Long, chair of the board of the Oregon Emerald, is correct in asserting that “the responsibility of the board is to oversee the welfare of the corporation, and the newsroom cannot dictate financial, nor personnel policy.” However, it is entirely unclear how the proposed reforms would help the paper’s dire financial situation. The board has not clearly explained how paying an outside source a substantial salary to control the direction of the newspaper will provide financial benefit. This expenditure does not seem likely to help the Emerald in any respect. 
That said, the students’ strike may not be the best response to the problem. Both sides must be willing to negotiate with each other to construct the best plan possible, and the lines of communication must remain open. We hope that both parties will consider each other’s positions and devise a strategy that will both salvage the newspaper’s financial situation and, more importantly, protect the independence of its content.

In a meeting with top U.S. scientists and stem cell researchers on Monday, President Obama signed an executive order that effectively overturns the Bush administration’s limits on funding for embryonic stem cells. The memorandum provides for an increase in federal funding of stem cell research, and should expand the number of cell lines for which researchers can receive funding. This move is both a departure from the policies of the Bush administration and a protection of what Obama has dubbed “scientific integrity.” As Obama said on Monday, “It is about ensuring that scientific data is never distorted or concealed to serve a political agenda and that we make scientific decisions based on facts, not ideology.” The move is promising and should increase the chance that stem cell research will lead to long anticipated cures for a wide range of diseases.
There has always been a great deal of potential for an amenable government to provide aid to stem cell research. Obama’s memorandum does not specifically deal with the certain types or numbers of stem cell lines that scientists can use. Instead, the National Institute of Health will have 120 days to establish new research guidelines, meaning that the number of accessible stem cell lines—which Bush had limited to 21—should soon be in the hundreds. This will allow scientists to work on new lines and start to draw together cells of different sources, which should lead to more rapid advances.
Obama’s measures separate Bush’s ethical ideology from the truth of stem cell research. The ethical arguments levied against stem cells are unconvincing. The use of stem cells is not a destruction of human life. The embryos from which these cells are cultivated are merely a collection of cells—with no moral status as persons—and would otherwise be discarded. Yet, the use of this collection of cells could have life-saving implications. The restrictive policies of the previous administration allowed religious beliefs to hinder scientific advancement. Moreover, due to the limitations of the past eight years, progress will be slow. As Dr. Curt Civin, director of the University of Maryland Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine said, “We’ve got eight years of science to make up for, now the silly restrictions are lifted.” The concrete benefits of Obama’s policy reversal may not be seen for many years.
With the bold support for stem cell research this memorandum provides, however, researchers and the public should remember other possible sources of stem cells and types of research for disease treatment. Given the divisiveness of this issue, support for non-embryonic stem cell research should also remain. Fortunately, this memorandum will set the tone for all types of scientific research throughout the administration. “I would simply say that this memorandum is not concerned solely—or even specifically—with stem cell research,” said Harold Varmus, chairman of the White Houses’ Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. This referendum is not meant to be politicizing, but will also separate ideology from broader policy debates such as renewable energy and climate change.
President Obama’s memorandum should also be a boon for Harvard’s stem cell initiatives, for it should stimulate our research programs. This excitement is somewhat attenuated, however in light of our university’s current science related woes. It is unfortunate that we have slowed construction of the science complex in Allston, which has pushed stem cell research into old laboratories unequipped for such advanced procedures. We have already begun to witness the fallout created by the Allston delay: a few prominent professors of Molecular and Cellular Biology, displaced by the recent changes, have threatened to leave the university. We hope that, as Obama’s policy changes take effect in the next couple of years, Harvard will take advantage of these new scientific opportunities by providing its professors and researchers with the needed resources. Meanwhile, we are heartened by this new support for scientific progress in Washington.

It’s that time of year—winter is staging a last stand, the United States and South Korea are playing their yearly war games, and North Korea is threatening the region. This time, though, Kim Jong-Il’s rogue state forces us to ask whether it is merely crying wolf again. With more pressing issues on its plate, the United States can not cater to North Korea’s pouting.
North Korea’s foreign relations policy comes off as the same tired charade. This time, North Korea has announced the start of preparations for a non-military rocket launch. The official news agency, says the communications satellite will be launched into orbit by the rocket, making North Korea “economically strong.”
The preposterousness of this claim must be noted. One satellite will not revive North Korea’s dysfunctional economic system. But even if it could, North Korea’s claims should still be met with great skepticism. There is nothing new about this “new” satellite—supposedly ushering in an exciting era for North Korea, it is instead strikingly reminiscent of 1998, when North Korea used the same claim as an excuse to test-fire a Taepodong-1 cruise missile over the territory of regional power Japan. Fresher in the public’s memory, in the summer of 2006, North Korea ignored the dismay of regional powers South Korea, Japan, and China by firing a long range Taepodong-2 missile feared at the time to have a capability of reaching the western United States. To North Korea’s embarrassment, and the world’s relief, that missile failed after forty seconds.
Of course, because North Korea’s announcement happens to coincide with joint military exercises by American and South Korean troops, North Korea has responded with predictable threats and the placement of its troops on full military alert. This is an over-reaction—the troop exercises are defensive in nature, preparing for the eventualities of an attack by North Korea. The exercises are ridiculous; it’s hard to imagine swarms of American and South Korean troops storming the border in the case of a North Korean attack. Yet can anything really be discounted as ridiculous when North Korea continues to posture as if war will happen any day now?
The United States has responded to North Korea’s latest moves with extremely diplomatic, cautious expressions of concern. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for North Korea to end its threats during a trip to the South Korean capital, Seoul, in late February. And after North Korea’s latest threats, the State Department’s special envoy on North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, has taken his turn, calling the threats unproductive, especially as the United States was willing to reach out to the North Koreans and continue to build relations. These relations would presumably start with the negotiations from which Kim’s government withdrew in January.
Such remarks may be safe, but you can only play with crazy people for so long before working with them makes you crazy yourself. That point has been reached with North Korea. Washington has shown a willingness to talk with nations with which it has not always had strong relations, from Russia to potential Taliban members. Wasting time satisfying North Korea’s national Napoleon complex, however, is not worth the new administration’s efforts.
The possibility of conflict with North Korea is remote to nonexistent. It has fired missiles before and threatened war on many occasions. Even Kim knows that such a war would be disastrous for his nation, which barely functions economically even in peacetime. Clinton and the state department must let North Korea know that we are sick of playing the “cry wolf” game. Our military exercises will continue, and the government in Pyongyang can either grow up, or issue another statement to deaf ears. For now, North Korea has given the world no reason to take it seriously.

In an ideal Harvard—a Harvard at which students feel safe, supported, and guarded—mutual respect and understanding are both indispensable and necessary.  Along with many others in the Harvard community, we in the Harvard Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Student Alliance and the Harvard Men Against Rape seek to foster a culture of sexual respect and safety at Harvard.  For such a culture to flourish, regard for the privacy and emotions of sexual assault victims is essential.The Crimson’s recent articles “Sexual Assault in River House Reported Saturday” (Tuesday, February 24, 2009) and “Police Officers Swarm Mather” (Monday, February 23, 2009), regarding an ongoing sexual assault investigation, violated individuals’ personal rights and trampled efforts towards a civil, respectful community at Harvard.The choice to report the incident publicly should have been left to the discretion of the Harvard University Police Department.  Indeed, HUPD has proven capable of protecting the community in the past, releasing warnings of potential safety threats, making resources readily available to students, and responding quickly and efficiently to distress calls. Additionally, HUPD typically withholds details of incidents while investigations are still pending and—in accordance with Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 41, Section 97D—maintains confidentiality.Nonetheless, The Crimson took it upon itself to conduct its own investigation into a sensitive and personal matter.  This investigation was invasive, continuing although “[s]tudents closest to the situation have largely been unwilling to comment[…].”Subsequent to its investigation, The Crimson produced a pair of disrespectful and injurious reports regarding the incident.  The articles grossly violated the privacy of students involved.  Room numbers were provided in both articles, and some future plans of the student allegedly involved in the incident were indicated. Irrespective of what transpired this past Saturday night, The Harvard Crimson’s reporting of this incident is a setback for the culture of sexual respect many seek at Harvard.  Victims of any crimes—and especially of sexual assault, where underreporting is rampant—should feel safe to seek the help of authorities.  They should not have to fear that, in seeking help they might suffer further violation in having their trauma turned into headlines.  Likewise, friends of victims should not feel helpless to provide assistance and comfort, nor should they be badgered to reveal sensitive personal information.The greater Harvard community should not have to fear that a newspaper intended to inform will do so in a fashion as intrusive and inappropriate as in the dual articles on this “alleged incident.”  The Harvard community appreciates relevant news, but even more so, appreciates respect and dignity.

To the editors:The Crimson reported the expected executive order permitting the federal funding of medical research involving the destruction of human embryos (“Stem Cells to get Federal Funding” news story, March 9). The judgment by the author that the previous arrangements imposed “onerous restrictions” on research seemed to dismiss out of hand the moral good which the now lapsed rules sought to promote. The article did not mention a second executive order, which is intended to unfetter science from restriction by any narrow political ideology. These two acts are intimately linked. What then is the “ideology” which has heretofore obstructed the progress of science in this area? It is precisely this: that human beings have intrinsic rights rather than just those which the state condescends to grant them. That human embryos are human beings is a “scientific fact” that anyone may read in an embryology textbook. Indeed it sounds rather like a tautology. However, that human beings might have rights by virtue of their very nature rather than being granted them by the state at some point in their development, is apparently mere ideology.If human rights are not intrinsic, where might they come from, that is by whom or what are they granted? The signers of the Declaration of Independence did not arrogate for themselves or for their respective governments such a power, but merely recognized certain rights to be God-given. Even the drafters of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights appear by their language to have recognized certain natural rights, though the distinction between these and legal rights is less clear there.The quotes from various researchers in the article betray a lack of interest in the moral questions surrounding embryonic stem-cell research. By relegating to the category of ideology the principle that natural rights place some bounds on acceptable human behavior and scientific investigation, the current administration weakens the protection of the innocent against the whim of the powerful. Human nature being what it is, the assumed benevolence of the strong can be but a temporary check on the descent of our civilization into savagery.ALAN C. O’CONNORCambridge, MassMarch 9, 2009

With leading economists predicting that the current recession will be the longest since World War II, families across America are looking for novel strategies to maximize their earnings. Enter Megan Basham, author of “Beside Every Successful Man”, whose controversial claim is that women, by quitting their jobs and applying their skills, education, and talent to advance their husbands’ careers, can achieve greater financial security for their families than with two incomes. Marketed to business savvy career women who desire a “slower-paced, more graceful, family oriented life,”  Basham’s book outlines a plan wherein wives transform into indispensable career partners for their husbands by mentoring, advising, and pushing them to get ahead.
Basham’s reasoning—that women don’t want careers anyway—draws mainly on opinion polling and anecdotal evidence: “Ask a group of mothers if they would continue to work full-time if they didn’t have to and the answer will overwhelmingly come back ‘No!’,” she writes.  Despite the fact that this statement is a near truism (wouldn’t the majority of people cut back on work if their monetary circumstances permitted?), Basham proceeds to cite additional surveys proving that, while working women strongly desire to drift back into domesticity, men want to remain in the workplace, even in the absence of a financial imperative to do so.  What better solution, Basham reasons, than to abide by these apparently biological urges and allow the man to work, while the woman acts as a productivity and profit maximizing sidekick?  
However, given the notorious inaccuracy of polling data, the answer is not nearly so simple. The wording and framing of the survey question can have a decisive impact on the results, so much so that alternative polls demonstrate the exact opposite of Basham’s findings: namely, that the majority of high-achieving males would prefer to stay at home if money allowed and that most mothers married to men with annual earnings of over $120,000 remain in the workforce, in spite of their financial freedom.  More damagingly, Basham confuses the distinction between correlation and causation: women’s stated desire to revert to the home may have stronger grounding in the cultural myth of the happy homemaker and in the pervasive prejudices against women in high-powered jobs, rather than in a genuine lust for the kitchen. 
Beyond her absolute reliance on dubious data, Basham’s argument obfuscates the socioeconomic structures that render her step by step plan unfeasible for the bulk of American families. When Basham alludes to a “group of mothers,” she would be more truthful to reference a “group of white upper middle class mothers with equally well-to-do husbands.” Indeed, the women that Basham upholds as paradigms of her “career partner” include the wife of the founder of Amazon.com and the wife of the former CEO of Time Warner.  These are women who relinquish financial autonomy and rely on their husbands for monetary support. Yet, for the majority of women, the decision to leave the workplace in order to become their husbands’ most dutiful cheerleaders is far more risky. With a 50-50 chance of divorce and the unforeseeable risk of spousal death and illness, ordinary women who heed Basham’s advice may well find themselves high and dry. 
The statistics speak for themselves: according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, in 2006, only 7 percent of people living in households headed by a married individual were  poor, while households with an unmarried leader (83 percent of whom were female) boasted poverty rates of 40.3 percent.  The authors of the NBER’s June 2006 digest further concluded that changes in household structure—namely, the increase in female-headed families—were largely to blame for the rise in domestic poverty rates since the 1980s.  Due to the myths perpetuated by “pro-family” Basham-types—that women need not cultivate their own careers, but should merely nurture those of their husbands—the removal of the man from the family, whether due to death or divorce, can impoverish its remaining members. 
Intensifying these trends is the disproportionate effect of the recession on women, who, due to pervasive economic disadvantage, have fewer personal assets and marketable skills to leverage when times turn hard. With unemployment among women rising faster, and women’s wages falling more quickly, than those of their male counterparts, it is now more important than ever that women  reject Basham’s advice—not only for the sake of leading their own fulfilling lives, but also to ensure the financial safety of their families.
In addition to her erasure of socioeconomic diversity, Basham neglects to comprehend that her solution may perpetuate the alleged distaste of women for work that initially motivates her argument. The inflexible culture which drives many women away from the professional world is only exacerbated when men have full time “career partners” at home, streamlining their activities so that they can clock even more hours at the office.  If Basham believes so strongly in her own hypothesis, perhaps she should stop writing books that encourage women to find security in renouncing their ability to support themselves, and move back home to live vicariously through her husband’s career.

Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 announced on Friday that $437.9 million from President Obama’s stimulus package is targeted for state transportation projects.  According to a press release on Patrick’s official Web site, approximately $153 million of that amount will be given to “shovel-ready” highway and transit projects advertised for bid within the next 120 days. Shovel-ready projects are those that already have all requisite approvals and permits in place. For Cantabrigians, this could mean a new $36 million pedestrian bridge from North Point Park in Cambridge to Paul Revere Park in Charlestown, a highway project identified by the state as eligible for federal funding. The press release also said that $319 million in funds will go toward the Regional Transit Authorities and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority for projects like Green and Silver Line enhancements, station repairs, and facility upgrades. Local projects that are awaiting a decision on federal funds include the construction of a new elevator in the Harvard T station, which would cost $7.7 million, and a 30,000 sq. ft. skate park in East Cambridge with a price tag of $1.8 million. According to Patrick’s Massachusetts Recovery and Reinvestment Plan Web site, no decisions have been made yet regarding which of these projects will receive federal funding. As of Feb. 23, the state has compiled more than 3000 shovel-ready projects that might get money.Projects from Cambridge that continue to await judgment regarding shovel-ready status include the renovation of Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School and fire safety improvements for City Hall. “This is a work in progress,” said State Representative Alice K. Wolf. “Right now there are lists of projects that have had prior approval to be shovel-ready, but there’s still going to be another level of approval.” Cynthia M. Roy, spokeswoman for the state’s Office of Administration and Finance, said that the selection of specific projects to receive funding will be based on a number of factors, including the number of jobs created, long term economic benefits, and sustainable development principles. In addition to transportation funding, Massachusetts is in line to receive between six and nine billion dollars over the next two years for education, health care, public safety, housing, and other programs. On Friday, President Obama announced that Massachusetts will receive $40.7 million for law enforcement assistance and crime prevention programs, including $246,068 for the City of Cambridge.According to Patrick’s Web site, the federal stimulus money will not be distributed as a lump sum. Some of the money will be directed through existing state or municipality programs, while other funds will flow directly to individuals, families, and businesses in the form of tax cuts and credits. But Wolf—who said that she is anxious about funding for essential services like education and healthcare—said that she viewed this method of funding as “fragmented.” “It’s like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, but we don’t know what the end looks like,” Wolf said.  In December, Patrick established 10 task forces to prepare Massachusetts for the receipt of stimulus funding from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Signed into law in February, the bill is designed to jump-start the economy and create or save jobs.“The stimulus package will help enormously,” said Patrick in a testimony to the State’s Ways and Means Committee last week, “But it will not close our budget gap.”In order to address the state’s current $1.1 billion shortfall, Patrick said the state needs new sources of revenue—such as a proposed increase in the gas tax—and budget cuts.­—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard affiliate Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center announced last week that it will consider layoffs to cope with grim financial projections.The hospital announced an anticipated $20 million operating loss for the fiscal year beginning next October, due in part to a projected decline in number of patients. The hospital hopes to break even, under best case scenario projections, for this fiscal year. The announcement is a marked departure from previous predictions of Beth Israel’s CEO, Paul Levy, who said in an interview last month that “we have chosen not to do layoffs.” Levy said then that Beth Israel was not as troubled as other Harvard institutions, such as the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, which had already announced plans for layoffs at the time. Levy wrote in a letter to staff last week that Beth Israel’s two percent, $18 million operating margin for fiscal year 2009 “has disappeared,” partly due to an unexpectedly $7 million cut in state-sponsored Medicaid, which accounted for nearly a third of Beth Israel’s operating budget.Levy said that the hospital is prudently slowing down how quickly they spend their grants.Furthermore, slowed spending of federal research grants has resulted in another $5 to $8 million in revenue shortfall for the hospital. Levy said that because researchers are stretching their grants into the first quarter of next year, the hospital has not received its indirect payments as quickly, resulting in less revenue on hand.“That just shows you how things you would never anticipate—dozens of researchers all of the sudden being more prudent—affect the bottom line of the hospital,” Levy said.He said that this loss might be counteracted by an increase in NIH funding, pledged as part of Obama’s stimulus package.Levy attributed the remaining major losses to the operating budget to a decreased patient load because of the financial crisis.Some of the decrease resulted from a new policy that no longer allows emergency room diversions to Beth Israel from Mass. General and Brigham and Womens’ hospitals, Levy said.Levy added at the meeting that there has been a cultural shift in treatment as well, as workers insecure in their employment postpone taking time off for elective surgery out of the fear their job might not be there when they return.After his announcement Wednesday, Levy held three town meetings Friday to solicit input from staff about creative solutions to decrease expenses. He said that the town meetings, and full disclosure of Beth Israel’s financial status, are part of his overall goal for transparency.“You have a right to know this because you work here,” Levy told one of the groups. “I want to explore with you whether there are other options to obviate some of these layoffs.”Levy said that employees will be surveyed to determine their preferred cuts, and final decisions about layoffs will be made by April 1.—Staff writer Laura G.

Harvard stem cell researchers hailed President Obama’s reported intention to lift restrictions on federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research today as a decision that will change the landscape of biomedical research.The decision coincides with the recent passage of Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package, potentially making stem cell researchers nationwide eligible for some of the $10.4 billion earmarked for the National Institutes of Health, an unrivaled source of federal funding for biomedical research that gave Harvard researchers $351 million last fiscal year.Until today, federal funding for embryonic research—which some criticize as unethical because it requires the destruction of embryos—had been constrained by a 2001 order from President Bush that limited funding to research using only the 21 cell lines existing at the time of his directive.Critics of that restriction have long contended that embryonic stem cells—believed to be capable of morphing into any body tissue cells—merit federal support because they could lead to new treatments for degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s.Once Obama signs the executive order, researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute will be able to not only tap into this previously unavailable funding stream, but also conduct embryonic research without current onerous restrictions on separating privately and publicly funded research.“You have to go through a lot of hoops in order to find the space to be able to do the work,” said Gordon C. Weir, a professor of medicine who works at Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, where he said stem cell research must occur in a specific room renovated by non-federal dollars.Under current law, stem cell researchers must be exceedingly careful to ensure that nothing funded by the NIH contributes in any way to embryonic stem cell research, forcing researchers to purchase duplicate sets of expensive equipment and laboratory supplies or create separate facilities, such as those at the Joslin Center.“It’s been very inhibiting,” Weir said of the federal restrictions, adding that regulations had prevented him and his colleagues from starting a project that involved injecting embryonic stem cells into animals to study how well the cells function when transplanted.Because the project could not receive federal support, he would have had to spend over $10,000 to purchase separate animal cages and other equipment—too high a price tag for the private donors who would have had to fund it. Weir said he and his colleagues decided to hold off on the project in the hope that Obama would soon lift federal restrictions. They now intend to seek federal support for the project, he said.Kevin Casey, the University’s chief lobbyist, said that Harvard has long called for such a decision, both individually and in concert with the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, a national bipartisan research advocacy group. And the timing of the announcement may allow Harvard researchers to apply for federal funding to support embryonic stem cell research, Casey said. “With the stimulus bill legislation, it would have been a shame to miss that opportunity for embryonic stem cell research to benefit from that,” Casey said.—Staff writer June Q.

Relatives of the Class of 2010 descended on campus this weekend for a schedule packed with open houses, campus tours, and faculty presentations. 
The annual Junior Parents’ Weekend was organized by the Harvard College Parents Association and the Crimson Key Society. 
After kicking off the weekend with half a day of open houses in classes and at campus museums, parents were welcomed by University President Drew G. Faust and a panel of senior college administrators late Friday afternoon. House receptions followed for parents to meet House Masters and other parents.
“We had the same traditional events like presentations by faculty members and panels,” said Gary L. Pelissier ’11, a Crimson Key member and co-coordinator of Junior Parents Weekend.
Along with regular campus tours led by the Crimson Key Society, parents were offered an exclusive “Behind the Scenes” tour of Memorial Hall on Saturday morning.
Parents attended faculty presentations by recently-named Pforzheimer House Master and Sociology Professor Nicholas A. Christakis, Dunster House Master and Government Professor Roger Porter, Physics Professor Melissa Franklin, and Music Professor Sean Gallagher.
According to Lee Ann Custer, Crimson Key’s president who is also a Crimson arts writer,  “Junior Parents’ weekend is certainly one of the CKS’s favorite weekends because it gives us a chance to welcome parents when their students are in a different stage of life at Harvard.”
In addition to attending the array of events planned, parents used the weekend to listen in on meetings of organizations that their children regularly attend during the school year.
“During sophomore year, I didn’t pay a visit... [so] I’m glad that I am here now to be supportive of my son,” said Ilryong Moon ’81—father of Joonyoung E.M. Moon ’10—while attending a meeting for the Asian American Christian Fellowship. 
Some students said that the loosely-planned schedule was not the best for their visiting parents, explaining that they would have preferred a more structured weekend, perhaps with more socializing opportunities for parents. 
“There should be a clearer structure so that parents know what is going on and where they should be,” said David E. Tebaldi ’10. 
“We should also have a barbecue or something that is outside so that it is a little more open for parents to socialize,” he said. 
Regardless of the lack of a barbecue, parents and students of all class years were able to enjoy improved food offerings in dining halls.
“The food is better than usual,” said Aleksandra Kuczmarska '10. “The [dining hall] put out things they typically don’t have out...There is even a nicer spread for the salad bar.”

For companies looking to make cuts in the grips of recession, the appetizer, entree, and dessert may be the first things to go.The company holiday party, once an obligatory, lavish celebration, has become “gauche” in a time of pink slips and downsized bonuses, said desserterie Finale co-Founder and President Paul D. Consorti. And Cambridge’s high-end eateries are feeling the pinch.“We had a company, that will remain nameless, cancel their annual holiday party because the week before they had laid off a bunch of employees,” Consorti said.Though Harvard Square restaurants report that business has not fallen dramatically, one definite casualty of the economy has been corporate meals, dealing a big blow to high-end restaurants that host such events and traditionally see many customers dining on expense accounts.The downturn has prompted fewer companies to pick up the check for recruiting events and celebrations. And instead of entertaining clients with dinner, some firms are opting for a lighter-on-the-expense-account lunch.“We see a little more business at lunch,” said Executive Chef Peter W. Davis of Henrietta’s Table. “[We’re seeing] more entertaining business at lunch and companies shifting entertaining to lunch more.”Om Restaurant and Lounge has noticed corporate budget cutbacks, with companies opting for cocktail parties over fancy dinners to celebrate the holidays.“A lot of companies scaled back on their holiday parties,” Event Coordinator Leah E. Horgan said. “For a lot of the bigger companies, they didn’t cancel altogether. As opposed to doing a dinner, they’d do a cocktail hour.”Harvest, an upscale eatery on Brattle Street, has lost much of its corporate business because of the recession, according to Ivan T. Law, the restaurant’s general manager.“We used to do a lot of private dining with financial firms,” Law said, adding that one firm in particular has been on a leave of absence. “We don’t see as much of Lehman Brothers.”At Chez Henri, it’s been business as usual. “Our recruiting has been okay,” said dining room manager Christy Leveroni. The restaurant still hosts a few recruiting events, including some for Harvard Law School students.But for establishments that rely more heavily on corporate dollars, she said, “I can understand they would be suffering a little bit more.”Matthew C. Lishanky from Upstairs on the Square said that recruiting isn’t the only thing that has changed—so have the part-time career aspirations of former Wall Street bigwigs.“It’s amazing to see the influx of resumes of lawyers and financial analysts applying for positions as servers and bussers,” said Lishanky, the restaurant’s director of operations.This phenomenon did not hold to be true at other restaurants interviewed, who said that the pool of applicants is broader and more talented, but not necessarily of the ex-banker persuasion.But as Lishanky pointed out, “People will always have to eat. People will not always need a 401k.”—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard Phillips Brooks House Association’s Alternative Spring Break program received a record 380 applications for this year’s trips—an increase of approximately 90 percent over last year. The program, which gives students the opportunity to work on public service projects over the week-long vacation, will send about 120 students to nine different locations this March. More students will be participating in the program this year than any other year in its near half-century history, with the exception of 2006, when a special donation from the Harvard COOP allowed 150 students to work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.PBHA Executive Director Gene A. Corbin said he believed the rise in applicants was the effect of both word-of-mouth and increased civic-mindedness among students. He also cited the Obama campaign’s positive impact on participation in public service.PBHA Director of Programs Kate Meunier similarly attributed the increase to a broad trend among students. “If you look at the millennial generation, they do more service than anyone before ever has,” she said. Both administrators also cited the financial crisis as a possible factor.“People are saying, ‘my family might not have the funds for a more expensive vacation,’” Corbin said. The rise in applications accompanies several notable changes in the program’s organization, including the replacement of three of last year’s trips with new programs. This year, students will be able to work at an animal shelter in Massachusetts, a public boarding school in Washington, D.C., and in the Broadmoor neighborhood of New Orleans for the first time. Meunier said she was particularly excited about the new program in Washington.“A lot of our students are really interested in urban education,” she said. “It’s a great opportunity for them to look at a new model and teach.”Despite these shifts, Meunier said that the budget for the ASB program—totaling approximately $50,000—will be “substantially smaller” than last year’s due to the economic climate. Operating costs for this year’s program will be about 25 percent lower than last year, partially because of cheaper plane tickets, she said. Funding for the program is raised mostly by student organizers, though contributions from the President’s Public Service Fund at Harvard and the $100 fee from participating students also help finance the trips.Corbin said that the program has had a positive impact on participants in the past, and has inspired many students to pursue careers in public service.“PBHA has struggled with the question of whether these trips make sense in difficult economic times,” he said. “I think we’ve worked hard to make sure that these trips do build sustainable partnerships and that they are making a contribution to these communities.”—Staff writer Evan T.

A group of concerned Harvard alumni organized protests outside of the Harvard Club of New York last Thursday, demanding that the administration save Harvard jobs.While the University has not officially announced employee layoffs, budgetary cutbacks are expected to result in job losses for workers employed through subcontractors. The protests in New York were organized in collaboration with the “No Layoffs” campaign organized by the Student Labor Action Movement  on campus, according to Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09, an active member of SLAM and an inactive Crimson editorial writer. “[The campaign] was initiated by alumni in order to show solidarity and express that alums are watching the layoff issues too,” she said.The protest outside of the Harvard Club of New York was organized by recent graduates Kelly L. Lee ’07, Michael A. Gould-Wartofsky ’07, J. Claire Provost ’07, and Kyle A. Krahel ’08. Both Provost and Gould-Wartofsky were members of SLAM during their undergraduate careers at Harvard. “We are aware that the economic downturn is affecting every sector of the economy,” Provost said. “But when we were undergraduates, we formed relationships with these workers. Even now that we are alumni, those relationships have not died out.”The protesters—who, according to Provost, included alumni, students, and parents—held signs saying, “Stop the layoffs,” and “Worker’s lives are not your rainy-day fund.” The protesters chose the Harvard Club of New York for its symbolic value, Provost said.“The Harvard Club of New York represents the presence of Harvard in New York as well as the material presence in New York, as well as its connection to alumni.” she said. “The events at the club are ludicrously expensive. And as an alumni, I do not find it a useful resource. It was a good place to stage a symbolic protest.”The protesters were denied access to the club and were not allowed to speak to a club representative.The group that organized the demonstration is considering other means through which to further their message. One possibility is a Web site that would aim to convince alumni to withhold donations; another option may be protesting outside of other Harvard clubs in the future.Provost said these ideas were still in the “development phase.”As for their plans for further protests outside the Harvard Club of New York, Provost said, “we’ll be back again.”

History was made last night. But not for the Crimson.For the first time in Harvard’s history, the men’s hockey team faced back-to-back shutout losses to a collegiate opponent on Friday and Saturday night at Bright Arena. In the first-round series of the ECAC Hockey Championship, No. 12-seed Brown (5-21-5) handed the fifth-seeded Harvard (9-16-6) two tight season-ending loses. Saturday night, with a must-win tension surrounding the Crimson players, the traveling Bears played to their best ability in a tight 2-0 win filled with frequent whistles and frequent shots.But the match’s turning point did not come on a whistle, but rather on an attempt by Harvard co-captain Jimmy Fraser with 7:37 left in the first period. Taking the puck past neutral and into Bears territory, Fraser fired a shot to the right of Brown freshman goalie Michael Clemente. The puck hit the post and seemingly dropped into the net before bouncing out. But the referees immediately waved off the goal, concluding the puck never crossed the goal line and frustrating the Crimson players.“I think in two nights, we hit six or seven posts altogether,” Harvard coach Ted Donato said. “You get that sense that that’s the way it was going.”  Prior to Fraser’s almost-goal, Brown started off the game using its momentum from Friday night’s upset, with a backhanded shot by senior Eric Slais less than three minutes into the game that put the Bears up 1-0.Despite Harvard’s 15 attempts in the first period alone, compared to Brown’s eight, the Crimson could not get the puck past the Bears defense and Clemente, who made a career-high 47 saves on the night.“We came out and tried to give them everything that we had, but they played well,” senior co-captain Brian McCafferty said. “Every shot that we took on [Clemente], he was real good with the rebounds. He never really gave us a second opportunity and he saved everything that came at him. Their whole unit really did a good job this weekend, which is hard to penetrate.”The rest of the first period would pass with Harvard seeming to get more and more frustrated at its inability to even out the score, losing some of its earlier momentum.“I don’t feel that we were able to ever get that injection of excitement and enthusiasm that you get when you score,” Donato said. “I thought we battled, but we could never break that seal.”On paper, Harvard looked to be the favorite coming into Saturday’s game, with Brown only winning five games this season compared to the Crimson’s nine. The Bears also had not won two games in a row this season, and prior to this weekend, it had only won one of nine playoff games against Harvard. But the Crimson knew not to doubt its Ivy rival’s ability. “Coming out of the Beanpot, I think that we were playing some of our best hockey and nobody really expected this,” McCafferty said. “But they’ve given us trouble all of my career. I think I’ve won one game against them in the four years I’ve played. It’s never an easy game against Brown, and they came these past two games and took it to us.”In the second period, Harvard again outshot its opponent 14-9. But despite a back-and-forth 20 minutes, and a power play each, neither team managed to put the puck in the net. Despite sophomore goalie Ryan Carroll’s 24 saves, Brown found another opportunity to score at 3:27 in the third. A penalty on Harvard sophomore Matt McCollem for interference, quickly followed by an infraction on assistant captain Alex Biega for boarding, gave the Bears 33 seconds of a 5-on-3 advantage. With new energy, Brown junior Aaron Volpatti took a pass from senior Matt Vokes and pushed it across Carroll’s line, giving the Bears an insurance goal. “Without scoring, at some point we were going to make a mistake,” Donato said. “At times we were pressing to try to get something going, but Clemente gave us few chances. I think we did a lot of things better than we did last night, but ultimately it didn’t end up in goals.”In the last minutes of the third period, with Brown’s Slais in the penalty box and Carroll out of goal, the Crimson had a two-man advantage and looked ready to attack. Even with taking the last eleven shots, Harvard still could not manage to get past Clemente. The only close attempt came from junior forward Doug Rogers whose shot bounced again off of the post. With Brown clearing the puck out of its territory, time expired, ending the game and ultimately Harvard’s season. After a rollercoaster campaign, the Crimson will have to wait to step back on the ice until next year. “Do I think we could have played better? Certainly,” Donato said. “It’s an early ending for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t supposed to end like this.
The fifth-seeded Harvard men’s hockey team hadn’t been shut out by an American collegiate team on consecutive nights since 1898.
Bottom-of-the-barrel Brown hadn’t won two games in a row all season. On top of that, no 12th-seeded team had ever toppled a fifth-seed in ECAC playoff history, and the Crimson hadn’t lost a home playoff series in 14 years.
According to the odds, Harvard should’ve been the winner.
But Bears goaltender Mike Clemente made a career-high 47 saves in the second game of the Bank of America ECAC Tournament last Saturday night, giving Brown a 2-0 victory and ending the Crimson’s season in the biggest upset of the weekend.
“We were never able to get that injection of excitement or enthusiasm that we get when we score,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We battled, but we weren’t able to break that seal, and I think Brown deserves a lot of credit. Clemente was superb both nights.”
It wasn’t for Harvard’s lack of effort. Seventeen Crimson players notched shots Saturday night, and Harvard posted a combined 86 shots on the weekend, but the rookie goalie was there to stop each one.
“[Clemente] was really seeing the puck, and he controlled his rebounds,” Donato said. “Having almost 90 shots in two nights and not having a lot of easy rebound opportunities is a credit to how he played.”
“He never really gave us a second opportunity,” co-captain Brian McCafferty said. “He saved everything that came at him, and their defense was real good with clearing away any rebounds that did get away. That whole unit was really good this weekend; they were really hard to penetrate.”
But, on top of Clemente’s stellar play, it seemed like the hockey gods were smiling on the Bears, as the very goalposts saved some of Harvard’s best chances to score.
Four Crimson attempts that weren’t included in Harvard’s final shot tally got by Clemente, but the pucks ricocheted off the pipes, thwarting the Crimson’s offensive efforts.
“In the two nights, I’m sure we had to hit six or seven posts altogether,” Donato said. “You got the sense that that was the way it was going, especially early on in the night when we hit two or three in the first period. I don’t know if I have the answer for how we could’ve solved it.”
BEAR ESSENTIALS
Although Harvard’s hot streak was cut short by the Bears, the Crimson had a Cinderella season up until then, battling back from a 13-game winless streak to finish out league play with just one loss in its last nine games and to secure fifth place in the ECAC. 
“Coming out of the Beanpot, I think we were playing some of our best hockey, and no one really expected this,” McCafferty said.
But Brown had also made a late-season comeback of sorts—landing a win against Quinnipiac, tying Colgate, and only losing to then-No. 10 Cornell in an overtime finish—before knocking the Crimson out of the running at Bright. Although the Bears had posted their fewest regular-season victories in 20 years, the squad seemed to have bulked up defensively, making a switch in the net (to Clemente) that resulted in two of Brown’s three regular-season victories—and a historic playoff series that will send the Bears to the quarterfinals against Yale this Friday.
“Even looking back to the very first time we played them, which was November or December, it’s a complete 180 to what they are now, especially these last couple weeks,” McCafferty said. “These games this weekend just show how much they’ve grown throughout the year.”
TWO-MINUTE MINORS
Brown’s victory over Harvard wasn’t the only upset of the weekend. Eleventh-seeded Rensselaer swept sixth-seeded Dartmouth, 2-0 (3-2, 3-1), and will advance to the quarterfinal round against second-place Cornell…Harvard and Brown hold the oldest active rivalry in college hockey. Their first contest took place in Boston in 1898, and the Bears edged a 6-0 victory over the Crimson, Harvard’s last shutout at home…The Crimson is 0-9-2 when trailing after one period this season and, oddly, is 0-2-1 when recording 40 or more shots.

The Harvard softball team (6-3) rode its stout defense and timely hitting to an impressive 4-1 record at the Miken Classic this weekend at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Fla.  After opening the Classic with a Friday sweep, the Crimson rebounded from a tough 1-0 loss to Central Michigan (3-7) to defeat Ivy foe Columbia (0-5) and Florida Atlantic (13-12). “We set some pretty strong goals for this weekend, and I think this tournament has been great,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We don’t have the fortune to play on our field in March, and I think this tournament has been good, because we have been able to play a variety of teams and styles.”HARVARD 3, FLORIDA ATLANTIC 2Harvard provided another extra-inning thriller in defeating host Florida Atlantic yesterday afternoon. Freshman Rachel Brown pitched all nine innings and struck out eight in her effort against the Owls.After Florida Atlantic scored off a triple in the opening inning, the Crimson responded with a run in the second. The game remained tied through seven innings, and each team scored a run in the eighth. In the bottom of the ninth, junior Jessica Pledger nailed a two-out RBI single down the left-field line for the win.HARVARD 5, COLUMBIA 0Freshman Marika Zumbro allowed three hits in five innings to gain her first career win against conference opponent Columbia Saturday afternoon. Zumbro struck out three Lions and used Harvard’s four-run second inning to garner the victory.  Junior Margaux Black closed the game by allowing no hits and striking out two Lions in two innings of brilliant work.  The Crimson used a balanced, methodical attack to put away Columbia. Nine different Harvard players had a hit, and Zumbro helped her own cause with an RBI double in the second and two runs scored in the game.  “We’ve faced some tough teams this weekend, and we’ve seen that we can hang with these teams,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “Seeing different styles of play from some teams, who have played a bunch more games than we have, helps tremendously.” CENTRAL MICHIGAN 1, HARVARD 0Despite a spectacular performance by pitcher Vertovez, the Crimson couldn’t get the bats going in a defensive struggle against the Chippewas on Saturday morning.  “We definitely had a mental lull in this game,” Allard said. “Our effort wasn’t as strong, and we should’ve rallied [around] Bailey’s terrific game.” The lone run of the game came on a leadoff home run in the bottom of the fourth, but Vertovez maintained her composure and only allowed one other hit and one walk in the game.  “We faced a good pitcher today, and we’re going to learn from that and make adjustments more quickly than we did today,” Brown said.  “We still showed a lot of heart.”HARVARD 5, TOWSON 3Seven innings wasn’t enough for the back and forth duel between Harvard and Towson (8-4) on Friday afternoon. After going down 1-0 in the first inning, the Crimson struck back with two runs in the third. After the Tigers regained the lead with a two-run frame of their own, Zumbro stepped in and pitched over three innings of scoreless ball. Co-captain Hayley Bock tied the game with a solo shot that sent the contest into extra innings at 3-3. Brown picked up her second win of the weekend, allowing only one hit and fanning four batters in two innings of relief. After sophomore Ellen Macadam reached on a fielder’s choice, junior Jessica Pledger provided the margin of victory with a two-run single in the eighth inning.  “Our pitching staff is really coming together,” Vertovez said. “We talked a lot about making pitch-to-pitch adjustments, and our freshman pitchers are really stepping up.” HARVARD 4, STONY BROOK 1The Crimson opened the Miken Classic on Friday morning with a convincing victory over 2008 NCAA qualifier Stony Brook (7-3). Brown struck out ten Seawolves and only allowed two hits on her way to a complete-game victory.  After a slow start to the game, Harvard pieced together a 3-0 lead after the fourth inning, led by Pledger who had two RBI.  Brown continued to dominate, and the Crimson withstood a Stony Brook rally in the seventh to seal the victory. “This was a great game—the team really came out wanting to win,” Brown said. “This is good for the pitchers to learn their endurance levels, and good for preparation in mental toughness. This team has great potential.”

A quick glance at the Harvard baseball team’s record after its first series of the season—a four-game set this weekend against Jacksonville State in Jacksonville, Ala.—might elicit a heavy sigh from the viewer, indicating a resigned preparedness to watch the Crimson struggle through another difficult campaign.But Harvard’s 1-3 mark is slightly misleading. The Crimson’s production at the plate—which was virtually nonexistent during certain stretches last season—appears to be in top form, and a few isolated meltdowns overshadowed promising outings by several Harvard pitchers this weekend.After the team’s bats struggled to shake off the cobwebs in Game 1 on Friday against the Gamecocks—a 4-1 loss, and the Crimson’s first live action outdoors this year—the Harvard offense came alive to string together 26 runs in the final three contests of the series.The Crimson’s pitching and defense couldn’t hold up its end of the bargain in a 12-10 loss in the first game of a doubleheader on Saturday, falling apart in the fifth and sixth innings and squandering an 8-1 lead.Harvard came into the seventh and final frame of the nightcap down 7-0, but erupted with six runs to nearly complete a thrilling comeback. In the final contest of the series yesterday, the Crimson picked up its first win of the season in a dominant 10-3 victory.“I thought that we showed a lot of positive signs,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “Each of the four ballgames we had a chance to win.”HARVARD 10, JACKSONVILLE STATE 3In the last contest of the Crimson’s four-game tilt against the Gamecocks yesterday, everything finally came together for Harvard.The squad received encouraging outings on the mound from two of its highly-touted rookies, Brent Suter and Marcus Way.Suter got the starting nod, and delivered an outstanding seven-inning performance in which he allowed just three runs on six hits and struck out seven Jacksonville State batters. Way—known more for his power bat than his pitching prowess—displayed a strong arm in two perfect innings of relief.“Those two, combined with [freshman pitcher and Saturday’s Game 2 starter Conner] Hulse, Coach Walsh likes to call them bulldogs,” Crimson captain Harry Douglas said. “That’s really what they proved.”Senior outfielder Tom Stack-Babich paced Harvard offensively, smashing a tape-measure three-run homer in the top of the fourth.“I flipped a changeup out onto the soccer field,” he said. “I hit it pretty hard.”JACKSONVILLE STATE 7, HARVARD 6After the Crimson let the Gamecocks come back from a seven-run deficit in the first game of Saturday’s doubleheader, Harvard almost returned the favor in the nightcap.Down 7-0 in the top of the seventh inning, the Crimson kept the runners moving with a string of singles and walks, including RBI base knocks by sophomore Tyler Albright, senior Taylor Meehan, Stack-Babich and Way.But with the Jacksonville State lead cut down to one, sophomore Thomas Zollo—who had singled earlier in the inning after coming in as a pinch hitter—struck out to end the game.“It’s definitely positive that we didn’t give up at the end,” Douglas said. “We weren’t going to give away any more plays, innings or games...It was just a little too late.”JACKSONVILLE STATE 12, HARVARD 10The Crimson appeared to be in control of the first contest of Saturday’s doubleheader, building an 8-1 lead in the opening innings of the game.But sophomore ace Max Perlman was taken out of the game in the fourth frame after pulling his side (the severity of the injury will be determined this week), and his successors could not finish the job.With little help from the Harvard defense—which committed two errors in an eight-run sixth by the Gamecocks—Meehan, freshman pitcher Will Keuper, and junior Dan Zailskas were tatooed by the Jacksonville State offense to the tune of 11 runs.“That inning was just [about] a lack of focus overall,” Douglas said. “That’s something we’re going to work to fix.”Down 12-8, the Crimson was unable to make a comeback, and the game slipped away.JACKSONVILLE STATE 4, HARVARD 1Rusty from not having played outdoors all year thanks to the baseball-averse Cambridge climate, the Crimson offense struggled in its first game of the season.Zailskas provided all of Harvard’s production with a solo home run, but the Crimson wasted a solid outing by sophomore starter Dan Berardo, who gave up just one run in five and a third innings of work.“Berardo was fantastic in that game,” Douglas said. “He was hitting all his spots. He looked really good.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

A change in time may herald a change in season; this Sunday, it was a case of the clocks springing forward and the Crimson bouncing back.Looking to respond to consecutive losses against No. 19 Michigan and Northwestern, No. 66 Harvard (5-3) welcomed Marquette (8-4) to the Murr Center for the first time in the program’s history.In a final score that belied the competitiveness of the encounter, the Crimson emerged 6-1 winners—after four singles matches went to a third set.“I think we were lucky to get away with a win today,” Harvard coach David Fish ’72 said. “I thought that it could have just started, and it would have been an avalanche against us.”If the Crimson wanted to stretch its winning streak at home duels to nine, it would have to clip the wings of the Golden Eagles. Through an insatiable work-ethic and refusal to lose, Marquette harried Harvard across the brackets, scrapping for every point.With the score poised at 3-1, freshman Davis Manghan delivered the crucial fourth point for the Crimson in dramatic circumstances; after slumping to a bagel in the opening set, Harvard’s No. 5—returning from illness—responded emphatically to defeat Marquette’s Mark Rutherford (0-6, 6-3, 7-5).“To see Davis come back after losing the first set 6-0—it was very professional,” said Fish. “It’s very easy just to pack it in and say ‘It’s not my day,’ but he didn’t...it was a big win for him”In spite of a determined showing by the Golden Eagles, it was the Crimson who claimed the doubles point in style.At No. 3, the sophomore-freshman partnership of Aba Omodele-Lucien and Manghan set the tone with an 8-5 win over the Marquette’s Niko Boulieris and Jonathan Schwerin. The point was sealed by junior Michael Hayes and freshman Alistair Felton at No. 2; the duo combined to save numerous break points, before Hayes’ delicate volley consigned Dusan Medan and Rutherford to an 8-6 defeat. Moments later at No. 1, senior captain and No. 65 in the nation Chris Clayton and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans applied gloss to the doubles point, overcoming Trent Hagan and Stephen Shao in an 8-4 win. But if Harvard was under any illusions regarding the strength of its opponents upon winning the doubles, it was sorely mistaken in the singles.With three wins needed in the singles to secure the win, three members of the Crimson’s line-up lost their first set. Far from disheartened from the loss of the doubles point, the Golden Eagles replied enthusiastically to the challenge by punishing a lackluster Harvard start.“[Marquette] came out firing—all of them had solid games, were aggressive and served well,” said Clayton. “It was good to see that we were able hang in the points and not give up in any of the matches.”After an anxious opening, the Crimson regained its composure through wins at both ends of the brackets. No. 6 Omodele-Lucien defeated his Golden Eagles counterpart Schwerin (6-2, 6-3), before No. 5 Felton fell to Boulieris in a 3-6, 6-1, 4-6 loss. Harvard struck back through a captain’s response; at No. 1, Clayton grinded out a 7-5, 7-6 (7-0) win over Hagan to leave the Crimson one point away from victory.With three singles matchups all in third sets remaining, a Harvard win was far from certain.With the outcome of the contest in the balance, No. 5 Manghan needed to break Rutherford at 6-5 to avoid a third set tiebreaker and clinch the match. Through an array of groundstrokes and volleys, the freshman forced a match point before Rutherford fired long to hand Manghan and the Crimson the win.“Every time you play a match you have to be ready for it to be ugly, and today was one of those days,” said Clayton. “At a certain point in the match, it could have gone either way.”The tie secured, Harvard wrapped up moments later with a pair of gritty victories. After a number of missed match points in the second set, No. 4 Hayes finally saw off the tenacious Shao in three sets (6-3, 6-7, 6-3), while at No. 2, Chijoff-Evans marked a complete turnaround over Medan in a fiercely contested 1-6, 7-6, 6-4 win. Despite the margin of victory for the Crimson, it was tested to the limit by a strong Marquette lineup that on another day could have celebrated its first fixture against Harvard with a win.“I think that as players and coaches we have to learn that lesson over and over again—that the doubles is nothing like the singles,” said Fish. “If it takes a real scare like this to remind us again, then I’m grateful that we got a scare and a win.”—Staff writer Allen J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shots; penalties; disallowed goals; last-gasp interventions; end-to-end counter attacking; a valiant comeback; overtime; goal-tending at its very finest. Everything a fan of the Harvard women’s hockey team could ask for in an ECAC Tournament semifinal matchup.Everything, that is, except a win for the Crimson.In an engrossing clash, No. 7 Harvard (19-10-3) suffered a shocking 3-2 defeat in extra minutes at the hands of Rensselaer (19-13-4). Not only did the loss knock Harvard out of the conference tourney, it also ensured that the Crimson would not get a bid for the NCAA Tournament, thus bringing a disappointing end to the season.Following competitive games against Harvard earlier in the season—a 1-1 draw and 5-4 loss—the Engineers recorded their first ever win over their opponents and an ECAC final berth through a long-range effort from junior Laura Gersten.“Obviously we’re very disappointed that we didn’t get the results that we wanted today,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “My compliments to RPI. They played tough, they played hard, and they took advantage of their opportunities.”Having fought back from a 2-0 reverse in the second period through a brace by senior forward Sarah Wilson, the end result was hard for Harvard to swallow.Though the Crimson outshot its opponent 50 to 17, it was thwarted by resolute defending by the Engineers, an inability to finish goal-scoring opportunities, and, at times, a simple lack of luck.“I think the hockey gods were favoring them today,” Stone said. “We hit a lot of posts. We had some wide-open opportunities. It might have just been their day and not ours.”To Crimson anguish and Engineer elation, the game was decided dramatically by the stick of Gersten.At 13:20, in RPI’s fourth power play of the game—after Harvard was penalized for too many skaters on the ice—Stewart found Gersten open on the right wing. From distance, the defenseman smashed the puck through a crowded goalmouth and past the glove of junior goaltender Christina Kessler.Cue delirium amongst the RPI bench and fans; cue devastation amongst the Crimson players so near but yet so far from victory.“You have to let [the players] go through the process of being disappointed and dissatisfied and see what comes out of the dust—you can’t patch the holes at this point,” Stone said. “They have to band together and take care of themselves. There’s nothing a coach can say in situations like this that will make them feel better.”From the outset, Harvard looked to seize the initiative, starting brightly in a competitive opening period.An early opportunity for the Crimson came through an instinctive combination between tri-captains. At the Harvard blue-line, senior forward Sarah Vaillancourt launched a defense-splitting pass to senior Jenny Brine for a 1-on-1 with RPI goaltender Sonja van der Bliek. The forward veered left and fired a backhand shot, but was denied by a quick recovery by the Engineeers’ goaltender.At 10:08, Crimson pressure resulted in the puck finding its way into the RPI net—only for the goal to be disallowed. Following a snap shot by junior Kathryn Farni from distance, sophomore Leanne Coskren scrambled the puck into the goal, but was deemed to have done so using her foot.“I think our team came out and played a hard-fought game,” Kessler said. “We generated a lot of offense and unfortunately we didn’t capitalize on our chances.”Not for the last time in the game, the Crimson was left to rue its spurned opportunities.At 13:44, RPI capitalized on the absence of junior Anna McDonald—penalized for a cross check—to take a surprise lead against its hosts. From the left boards, Harrison pivoted and slide a pass to Naslund in front of the crease. From a tight angle, the RPI forward poked the puck past Kessler for the opening goal—sending the large contingent of Engineers supporters into raptures.Minutes later, their lead over a shell-shocked Crimson was doubled. Receiving a pass around the left, Naslund found space in front of the Harvard goal. With defensemen backing off, the forward drove the puck beyond Kessler into the top-right corner for her second of the game.Faced with a two-goal deficit, Harvard got the best possible response from Wilson—the forward restored to the second line following illness.At 16:11, Wilson picked up a pass from McDonald on the right and zeroed in on goal. The forward fired a low shot past van der Bliek to halve the Engineers’ advantage.With the game on the line in the final period, Wilson spearheaded the Crimson resurgence in a third of sustained pressure. Taking advantage of a power play, the puck found its way out to Coskren deep on the right wing and the defenseman delivered a pinpoint pass for Wilson to hammer home the equalizer first time.With ten seconds left in the final period, mayhem ensued as Harvard bombarded the Engineers’ goal. After a faceoff in RPI territory, Brine found herself in space with an open net, but contrived to blaze the puck inches over goal. Barely a second remaining, Vaillancourt unleashed a snap shot a yard from goal; the net beckoning, the forward’s effort was repealed by an incredible diving save from van der Bliek, the puck flying wide.“If you’re generating great opportunities, putting pucks on net and getting great looks at the net, it’s either going to happen or not,” Stone said. “[The Harvard skaters] did everything they could to put themselves in a position to win. You can’t ask for anything else.”Into overtime, the Crimson continued to press. In the team’s best opportunity, Wilson was denied a hat trick by another extraordinary stop by van der Bliek; the shot, driven in from the right, was parried clear to safety by the body of the RPI goaltender, beyond two Harvard forwards ready to convert the rebound.—Staff writer Allen J.

With esteemed Harvard economics professor Gregory Mankiw seated two seats to the right of the players on the Crimson women’s basketball bench, grinning with nervous anticipation, a win against Brown Friday night was surely in high demand. Though the Bears (3-25, 1-13 Ivy) have an unfavorable record this season, Harvard (19-8, 11-2) did not pull safely ahead until late in the second half in this fast-paced duel, defeating Brown 81-57. Friday’s victory was a much needed “W” and kept the team in the running for a shared Ivy League title with first place Dartmouth.The Bears’ lineup was unique in that it was unspecialized and versatile—composed of nimble, evenly-sized players (all but two of Brown’s players are within three inches of 5’10) who were equally athletic and capable of filling any role that was immediately necessary on either end of the floor. Both teams’ offenses took time to warm up early on, while close defense set the tone for the game. Brown wasted no time before using a full court press, forcing the Crimson to rush on offense. Neither team shot particularly well at first, with gaps of two minutes between scores for either squad. “We had some matchup issues,” Harvard Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I don’t think we should be able to be pressed. We have enough ball handlers and we’re smart enough. But we were ok.”Eventually, the Crimson adjusted to the press and gained an advantage by connecting on the open looks that it was able to create over a tight Bears defense. With under 13 minutes to go in the half, Harvard co-captain Emily Tay hit three mid-range jumpers in a row to jump-start the offense, giving the Crimson a 15-8 lead. The tempo of the game picked up at this point, as Brown forced turnovers and Harvard took control on offense. The Crimson had to earn each offensive trip over the half-court line, carefully swinging the ball laterally between guards until one had room to push it forward. Harvard protected the ball by keeping it on the perimeter, patiently waiting to feed the post players when they established inside position. Forwards such as Claire Wheeler, Emma Moretzsohn, and Katie Rollins had impressive games, dominating the paint by grabbing boards on both ends of the floor and combining for 24 points and 20 rebounds. The Crimson outscored Brown 40-20 in the paint over the course of the game.“Claire did some nice things,” Delaney-Smith said. “Katie rotated well, Emma Moretzsohn was hungry out there for us. I’m pretty pleased.”Brown stayed competitive by contesting not only every shot, but every pass. Instead of allowing the initial passes of each play to occur, the Bears began swiping for the dishes on the perimeter. Brown guard Sadiea Williams, who finished with 10 points and four rebounds, was an athletic scrapper who rallied her team by challenging all of Harvard’s proceedings.With just over 7 minutes to play until halftime, the Crimson led 26-14. Brown stole and slashed their way back into the game behind the efforts of players such as Williams as well as forwards Sarah Delk and Amy Ehrhart. Harvard’s lead was just 6 at the break. “I’m not sure what happened towards the end of the [first] half,” said Crimson sophomore forward Emma Markley.Luckily for Harvard, Tay caught fire after halftime. Finishing with 14 points and eight assists, most of the offense passed through her hands, and she spread the flame to her teammates. She was a triple threat, sinking jumpers, foul shots, and sharing the ball with stylish no-look feeds.Double-digit point contributions from four of the Crimson’s five starters allowed for Harvard to pull ahead in the second half and take control of the game, coasting to victory in the closing minutes.Markley claimed the paint as her own as soon as the second period began. In addition to nine rebounds, she finished with 19 points, 15 of which came after halftime. With her acrobatic rebounds and inside scoring, Markley proved that at 6’3, she was not only the tallest player on the floor, but also one of the strongest and most athletic. “We focused on coming out on offense and attacking every time we had the chance,” said Markley. “We definitely crashed the boards and went back in strong.”“Emma Markley is…Emma Markley,” Delaney-Smith said.Freshman guard Brogan Berry celebrated her birthday in style, finishing with 13 points and five assists. As Mankiw might highlight, Harvard was the better team statistically in the second half. The Crimson outscored the Bears, 49-31, in the period, outrebounded them 25-15, and evened up the amount of free throws taken at 23. Shooting percentage was indicative of the result, as Harvard shot almost 50 percent from field goal range for the game while Brown shot under 30 percent.“I was invited to be honorary coach tonight,” Mankiw said. “It was a great game."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday night, co-captain Emily Tay showed all in attendance at Lavietes Pavilion exactly what they will be missing next season. 
Tay razzled and dazzled her way to a career-high 34 points, making her final home game in a Crimson uniform one to remember.
Even more meaningful than Tay’s spectacular performance on senior night, though, was the importance of the result. The Harvard women’s basketball team’s 91-57 demolition of Yale kept alive its hopes for a conference title, setting up a must-win matchup against league-leaders Dartmouth on Tuesday—the final day of the regular season.


The revenge factor made the manner of the victory even sweeter for the Crimson. 
A year ago, Harvard traveled to New Haven needing—and expecting—a win in order to clinch an Ivy League championship and the tournament spot that comes with it. Instead, the Bulldogs shocked the Crimson 64-58, putting a serious damper on Harvard’s shared title and forcing them into a three-team playoff for the tournament place (which it would go on to lose).
In 2006, a loss to Yale was the only blemish on an otherwise perfect conference record for the Crimson.
Add the usual Harvard-Yale rivalry, and it’s an understatement to say that there was no love lost on Saturday.
“Yale doesn’t show us a lot of respect,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “There are a lot of subtleties that are pretty disrespectful. And they’re crazy to do that nonsense, because it just makes us play harder and better.”
Harvard made its intentions clear from the get-go. Tay made a reverse layup to open the scoring, and then nailed a jumper the next time down the court. A steal and finish from freshman point guard Brogan Berry was followed by back-to-back jumpers from Tay. Before anyone on the Bulldogs’ sideline could catch a breath, the score was 12-0.
For its part, Yale never looked comfortable dealing with the Crimson’s zone defense. The Bulldogs had 15 turnovers to go along with 24-percent shooting in the first half.
On the other end of the floor, Yale had no answer for Tay. The senior ran the show, dishing crowd-pleasing passes when she wasn’t putting the ball in the basket herself. Tay started the game 7-for-7, finishing the period with 20 points.
“She takes over a game when she needs to,” said Berry, who had a very solid game of her own with 15 points and six assists.
The score at the break: 41-17. Tay had outscored the entire Bulldogs team, and Harvard could enjoy the last 20 minutes knowing that it would have the chance to play for an Ivy League title.
Despite relaxing on the defensive end in the second half, the Crimson offense remained on fire. The team shot 75 percent from the floor after the break.
The dominating performance contained significant contributions from every Harvard player. Sophomore Jackie Alemany finished with eight points, six boards, five assists, and four steals. Sophomore Claire Wheeler added 11 points to the effort.
The lopsided scoreline gave coach Delaney-Smith a chance to honor her seniors in front of the large home crowd. In perhaps the most emotional moment of the season, injured co-captain Niki Finelli—out for the season with an ACL tear—entered the game to a huge round of applause with a little over 30 seconds remaining in the game. 
“I think when she came out all of us cried,” Tay said.
“It’s hard to articulate how special that moment was,” Finelli said. “Just to step onto the court one more time and put on my uniform one more time…to be on the floor with my teammates. I’ve missed it terribly over the past week and a half or so, but to get that back is really special.”
Seniors forwards Katie Rollins and Emma Moretzsohn helped Harvard to dominate the paint, with the latter pulling in a game-high six rebounds.
Then there was Tay. The senior finished with 34 points, five boards, and two assists—both on no-look passes. Her final game at Lavietes ended with a long standing ovation when she was removed with over four minutes remaining.
“She’s unbelievable,” Finelli said. “There’s not much that’s better in this world than playing with her, but the next best thing might be watching her.”
The importance of the win and her career performance combined to produce a perfect night for Tay.
“We have a lot of history with Yale, so we used that as motivation,” Tay said. “But at the beginning of the game I told [the team] to just go out and have fun [because] that’s when we start clicking.”
But Harvard will not celebrate the feel-good win for too long, as the attention must now turn to Dartmouth on Tuesday.
“We are really excited to play them, and we’re just happy we have the chance to get a piece of the championship,” Tay said. “We are preparing starting now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a time, not too long ago, when a game against Rennselaer meant an opportunity for the Harvard women’s hockey team to give reserve players a chance to play and for the squad’s stars to pad their stats.
That time is over.
On Saturday afternoon, the Engineers upset the No. 7 Crimson, 3-2, in overtime to cap off an exhilarating matchup and advance to the ECAC Finals.
RPI’s win is a testament to the program’s development in recent years and to the increasingly higher level of competition in the ECAC and college women’s hockey in general.
“[The Engineers have] invested a lot of time and money into their program, and they’ve gotten results,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “They have some good kids, they play hard, they have strong work ethic…Every time we’ve [faced them], they’ve come out ready to play.”
The Crimson first got wind that RPI was no longer a conference doormat on Nov. 11, when the Engineers contained the Harvard offense enough to force a 1-1 tie.
RPI hung tough with the Crimson once again on Jan. 31, nearly coming back from a 5-2 deficit before falling just short at 5-4.
The Engineers’ victory on Saturday showed just how far the team has come. While Harvard outscored RPI, 17-1, in their last three meetings before this season, the revamped Engineers have handled their current campaign with renewed confidence and drive.
“When we found out we were playing them,” said RPI’s Whitney Naslund, when asked at which point the team felt that it could beat the Crimson. “When we found out we were playing Harvard, we were ready to play them. It doesn’t matter who we’re going to play. We came here to win.”
BETWEEN THE PIPES
In baseball, even the best of teams can be rendered powerless by an ace pitcher who has his best stuff on a particular day. The same is true of hockey and goalies.
While the Crimson offense has been successful this year, especially in the second half of the season, Harvard’s scoring efforts have occasionally been stymied by standout performances from opposing goalies.
The Crimson attacked the net relentlessly on Saturday, but the Engineers’ Sonja van der Bliek displayed her sharp reflexes and impressive agility in a 48-save effort in RPI’s 3-2 win.
Van der Bliek was aided by some luck—Harvard hit multiple posts and had an early goal taken away from it—but on several occasions she singlehandedly kept her team alive with sprawling saves that seemed to defy reason.
“I think it was pretty hectic, but that’s why I like being a goalie,” van der Bliek said.
COMEBACK KID
In last weekend’s sweep of Cornell in the ECAC Tournament quarterfinal round, Harvard tri-captain Sarah Wilson was forced to watch her team take down the Big Red from the stands because of illness.
On Saturday, Wilson returned to action, and had it not been for her efforts, the Crimson may not have even forced overtime.
With Harvard down 2-0 towards the end of the second period, Wilson received a leading pass from junior Anna McDonald and fired a strike to get Harvard on the board.
Then, midway through the third frame, sophomore defenseman Leanna Coskren found Wilson in front of the net, who slammed the puck home to force a tie.
In the end, Harvard was unable to take advantage of Wilson’s pair of goals and secure a victory, but the senior winger showed why she has been such a crucial piece of the Crimson’s offense over the last four seasons, in what turned out to be the final game of her college career.
“I felt good out there today,” Wilson said. “After watching them in the stands last week I was really ready to go and get out there with them. We played our heart out today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Fresh off a heartbreaking loss to Brown the night before, Harvard had no urge to be merciful in its season finale, upstaging Yale’s senior night with an impressive showing from both the Crimson’s veterans and its rising freshmen.
Senior guard Drew Housman had a game-high 38 minutes, consistently getting to the hoop and finding the open man for easy buckets. While Housman was controlling the perimeter, forward Evan Harris made his presence felt inside, playing a major role in neutralizing the Bulldog size advantage in the paint.
The seniors end their Crimson careers with the full knowledge that the program is in good hands, as freshmen Oliver McNally and Keith Wright were major factors in sending off their graduating teammates with a win.
Thanks to captain Andrew Pusar’s injury early in the game, guard McNally was called upon early and often, and he stepped up to the challenge. McNally’s shooting was especially crucial in the opening frame—his ten first-half points leading both squads—and he was rewarded with the second-half start. McNally’s 33 minutes of action was the most he has seen all season.
Harris’s counterpart, the 240-lb forward Wright, also came up big, going 5-of-7 from the field while in a constant battle against Yale’s relentless forwards. Wright displayed a remarkable array of moves in the post, knocking in tough hooks, layups, and jumpers.
“He’s going to be a great player,” Harris said. “He’s doing this as a freshmen, and these are some of the best big men I’ve played against in my four years here…hopefully he can keep doing his thing.”
POWER IN THE POST
One month ago, the Crimson took on the Bulldogs at Lavietes Pavilion, falling 87-66. The hosts were thoroughly outmatched, particularly in the frontcourt. Yale had 40 points in the paint to the home team’s 22.
This time around, the tables were turned, as it was Harvard with the 40-to-28 advantage in points in the paint. Harris and Wright did consistent damage, scoring inside and grabbing rebounds, five of which came on the offensive end.
“We made a conscious decision this time around—we weren’t going to let them punk us,” Housman said.
While Yale forwards Ross Morin and Travis Pinick combined for 35 points on 14-of-23 field goal shooting, the rest of the team shot 8-for-25. The Crimson did a stellar job of contesting close shots and denying easy opportunities, as the Bulldogs had a much tougher time finishing than they did in the previous matchup. 
“We put it on ourselves not to get killed,” Harris said. “We all had to step up tonight.”
Harvard displayed a team effort in clogging the paint and poking away balls, causing Morin and Pinick to turn the ball over five times each.
MENTAL TURNAROUND
Although the Crimson has not been the best at closing out games this season, it displayed an all-around mental toughness that helped cleanly put away its archrival, which seemed to fall apart in crunch time. 
The Bulldogs had 16 turnovers—many of which came late in the game on mishandlings and miscommunications—and thus were never able to find any sort of momentum. Spurred by junior Jeremy Lin pushing the ball on the fast break, Harvard capitalized repeatedly, scoring 16 points off turnovers.
The Crimson kept its own mistakes to a minimum, turning the ball over a mere ten times. Housman and McNally rendered Yale’s full court press mostly ineffective, evading the pressure and setting up the half court offense.
“We were disciplined, efficient…just doing things you’re supposed to do to finish it out,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Additionally important were second-half free throws, as Yale reached the foul line 15 times but only converted nine of those attempts. The Crimson only shot 62.5 percent for the game but was 5-of-7 at the stripe in the second frame.
Overall, Harvard played strong for a full forty minutes, experiencing no second-half letdown—another improvement on the previous contest with Yale. Harvard shot 30 percent from the field in the second half in February, but this time the Crimson went a blazing 58 percent to close out the game.
“I thought we started, sustained, and finished tonight, and that was really nice to see,” Amaker said.

Everything was going according to plan. In a tough if not ugly matchup against Brown, the Harvard men’s basketball team was up six, 59-53, with just under two minutes to play.A missed rebound and resultant three made it 59-56, but with senior stalwart Drew Housman—a career 81 percent free-throw shooter—going to the line for a one-and-one with 1:08 to play, the Crimson seemed to have little reason to worry. But after a missed first shot and a Bears layup on the other end, it was 59-58 with 47 seconds to play. But Harvard still had a shot to put the game out of reach, when Housman drove to the hoop and pulled up for an eight-footer. It clanked off the rim, and Brown took possession with 11 seconds left in the game.What happened next seemed an inevitability. Bears sophomore Garrett Leffleman, who had gone 0-5 from three point range before the shot, launched a desperation three as time expired, which found the bottom of the net, sealing the Crimson’s fate in a  heartbreaking 61-59 loss at Brown on Friday night.“We can hang our heads and cry and moan,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “But if we can’t snatch a rebound or come up with a loose ball or make a front end of a one-and-one down the stretch, that’s the difference in a tight game like this...We left the door open for them to make a play like they did at the end.”In the final 1:34 of play, the Bears blanked the Crimson, posting an 8-0 run to close out the win. Leffleman’s three-pointer capped the historic run, sparking the sparse crowd of Brown supporters to storm the court. As they did,  the Crimson left the court questioning what could have been.“It was hustle plays,” Harvard captain Andrew Pusar said. “They were able to keep a lot of balls alive, by getting their hands on rebounds, scrapping at the defensive end. We were up seven at the half, but they put us in a hole and got their engines going.”Freshman Oliver McNally, who paced the Crimson late in scoring seven points over the final five minutes of play, threw his jersey over his face, trying to block out the scene that was unfolding in front of him.Housman walked off stunned, as he had just seen a lead that he helped manufacture disappear. After falling behind by four late in the second half, Housman led the Crimson’s comeback effort and capped it with a huge three to give the Crimson a 51-50 lead with just under six minutes to play. From that point on, McNally did the rest, giving the Crimson a seemingly insurmountable lead with two minutes to play.“I thought Oliver played tremendously down the stretch,” Amaker said. “He stepped up and made big baskets for us.”Throughout the season, the Crimson has followed the lead of one man—junior Ivy League Player of the Year candidate Jeremy Lin. He walked off the court having notched ten points—but on 3-of-11 shooting. For many players this would have been a solid performance, for Lin, it fell below expectations.Harvard seemed poised for victory after dominating the first half to take a 35-28 lead at halftime. But the Crimson missed Lin in the beginning of the second frame, as he went cold and Harvard followed suit. After the first nine minutes of the second half, the game had been flipped on its head. Brown was now up seven, 46-39, as the Bears blitzed the Crimson to the tune of a 17-4 run to start play in the second frame.Harvard only shot 33 percent from the field in the second. The leader for Brown in its comeback bid was junior center Matt Mullery. It is not often that a player in the Ivy League tallies 20 points in a game. To do it while grabbing 20 boards is unheard of, but Mullery did just that, scorching the undersized Crimson frontcourt for 21 points and 20 rebounds. On the season, he has scored 47 total points in two games against Harvard.“I played a lot of minutes, that certainly had something to do with it,” Mullery said. “I was just going after the ball on every possession, keeping the motor going.”Still, in the end, it seemed like Harvard would pull out the victory, in part because Brown only shot 22 percent from three-point range in the game. Ironically, Leffleman—the hero of the game—would have been the match’s goat had it not been for that last shot. He missed wide-open three after wide-open three, going 0-for-5 from behind the arc in the game. But none of that mattered as time expired, when his desperation shot miraculously dropped through the net.—Staff writer Walter E. Howell can be reached at wehowell@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I.—It would have been difficult to imagine an ending more dramatic than the finish from the last time Harvard and Brown faced off, but the finale on Friday night might have topped it.  
In their last meeting, the Crimson stormed back from as many as 14 points down and won the game, 64-63, on a free-throw by junior forward Jeremy Lin with no time remaining. 
On Friday, the Bears exacted revenge. 
Though Harvard led by six with fewer than two minutes to play, Brown chipped away at the lead and found itself with a chance to win on the final possession. 
Trailing by one, the final seconds ticking down, Bears forward Chris Skrelja fed teammate Garrett Leffellman on the right wing. Leffellman, who had been cold shooting the entire game—going 0-5 behind the arc up until that moment—launched a fade-away three-pointer with a hand in his face. The ball fell through the net, delighting the crowd and sending the Crimson home with a gut-wrenching loss.  
Both meetings between these two teams could not have been any closer. Although one game ended on a clutch free-throw and the other on a desperation heave, each game was actually decided by which team made the hustle plays. 
“Our inability to come up with a defensive board, not get a loose ball, that’s the difference,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We weren’t able to do it and left the door open for them to make a play, like they did.” 
Brown dominated the Crimson on the glass, gathering 46 rebounds, including 14 offensive boards, while the Crimson managed just 31 rebounds, four on offense. 
“It was hustle plays,” said captain Andrew Pusar of the difference in the two meetings. “They were the first one to get that ball that was a 50-50 ball, and when they come away with that, they create a lot of extra opportunities for themselves and gained some momentum and some confidence. Unfortunately, that’s on us.” 
BEAR ATTACK 
The best player on the court Friday night was Bears forward Matt Mullery. The junior dominated in the post, scoring 21 points on 9-of-9 shooting and snatching 20 rebounds, a new career high.  
“He put in a great performance,” Amaker said. “To get 20 rebounds is an incredible stat line. If one kid gets 20 boards, that’s saying a lot.” 
Mullery filled out the rest of the stat line with four assists and three blocks. 
“I played a lot of minutes, that certainly had something to do with it,” Mullery said. “I was just going after the ball on every possession, keeping the motor going.” 
Mullery used his full arsenal of moves in the post against a thin Harvard front-line. He mixed in a steady stream of back-downs with spin moves and hook shots, always finishing with a feathery touch. Towards the end of the first half, the 6’8 junior even stepped behind the three-point line and buried a trey. 
“He played a really great game,” Pusar said. “He works hard for position, he finishes well. He did a lot of damage on us. He certainly earned everything he got, so hats off to him.”  
BLOCK PARTY 
The first half provided much excitement, as the Crimson put on a shot-blocking exhibition.  
A few minutes into the game, Leffelman tried to bank in a lay-up, but senior forward Evan Harris rose and swatted the attempt just before it reached the backboard.  
Towards the end of the first half, Harris struck again. This time, Brown guard Adrian Williams tried a floater in the lane, but Harris spiked the ball back, igniting a fast break. 
The most sensational play came moments later when Bears guard Peter Sullivan tried driving in the lane. Freshman Max Kenyi rotated on defense and jumped in the air to meet Sullivan. He cleanly blocked the ball into the backcourt before both he and Sullivan crumbled to the floor. 
“Max has the potential to make some pretty jaw-dropping plays,” Pusar said. “It’s a good sign for the future when you have that type of athleticism on the roster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With junior parents weekend placing an extra number of supporters in the stands, the MAC proved even more welcoming for a Harvard men’s volleyball team that has thrived at home.Entering Friday with all three of its wins coming in Cambridge, the Crimson (5-5, 2-1 EIVA Hay division) claimed its first undefeated weekend, with a sweep of Rutgers-Newark (6-7, 4-1) and NJIT (3-10, 0-7 EIVA Tait), moving into a second-place tie in conference play.“It was a great weekend for us,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We were able to score the points when we needed them, which is something we’ve struggled to do.”Points indeed came at big moments for the Crimson, which labored through five sets to dispatch the league-leading Scarlet Raiders on Friday night, before cruising to a much more comfortable four set win over NJIT on Saturday. HARVARD 3, NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 1The Crimson avoided a potential letdown after a tremendous victory on Friday night, demonstrating its focus early on to take the first two sets 30-26, 30-26.“After a really big game, it’s easy to take a breath and slack off,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “Playing NJIT, which is a non-conference game, when they didn’t put in all their starters is kind of disheartening...But I was really proud of everybody, and they didn’t play like it meant less, because a victory is a victory.”The Highlanders also seemed to take the match seriously, yelling raucously after every point won. But Harvard enjoyed the upper hand, relying on Weintraub’s crisp passing and the team’s solid outside hitting to close out the four-set victory with a 25-30, 30-18 split.Senior co-captain Brady Weissbourd led the attack with a dominant all-around performance, posting a match-high 27 kills—bringing his weekend total to 55—to go along with 10 digs, five blocks and four service aces.“Brady’s phenomenal,” Weintraub admired. “As long as I do my job right, it’s guaranteed he’ll do his. He’s just too good.”Weissbourd carried the load for the Crimson down the stretch, using his 6’9 frame and solid timing to stifle opponents and hammer spikes, many of which went untouched through the Highlanders’ defense.Harvard was not solely dependent on the senior, though, drawing from numerous offensive contributors to keep NJIT off-balance. Junior outside hitter Erik Kuld notched 16 kills, and freshman Matt Jones added 13. Weintraub spread 59 assists around, with sharp passes and no-look opportunities, preventing the Highlanders from mounting a serious comeback.Baise was particularly pleased with the Crimson’s ability to shut the door on NJIT, after so many matches have gone five sets.“Today was in some ways even better [than beating Rutgers],” he said. “We’ve struggled to close teams out...and tonight we lost our third [game], but turned it around in the fourth, reduced our errors, and served well. The serve was hopefully a turning point for us.”Such optimism about improved play has begun to take root, as Harvard finds itself back in the race for a league title. In order to take this step, though, the Crimson must find equal success on the road.  HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 2Friday evening’s contest brought more drama to the MAC, as the Crimson had to dig out of a 2-1 deficit to earn its second league victory. Weissbourd led all scorers with 28 kills, with Jones and Kuld totaling 14 and 13, respectively, off of Weintraub’s 57 helpers. Harvard began the match with a 30-27 win and opened a 3-0 second set lead, but sputtered, spotting the visitors a 24-30 second frame edge.The Crimson mounted a comeback of its own in the third, erasing a nine point deficit to tie the score at 28, but suffered a 33-31 setback that put the match in jeopardy. But the host squad buckled down late and drew on strong hitting and a service ace by sophomore Shaun Mansour to force a decisive fifth set.The final frame saw Weissbourd and Jones erupt on offense. The rookie hammered home four kills in a row to give Harvard a 9-3 cushion, while Weissbourd notched a kill and two blocks to close out the match, 15-12.Jones hesitated to take much credit for the team’s clutch hitting, citing the importance of a quality setter.“When Gil’s putting the ball right there, I just try to do what I can,” Jones said.In reality, the Crimson’s offense seems to be clicking on all cylinders, and toppling the league leaders has opened the door for Harvard to compete for a meaningful post-season.—Staff writer Max N.

Having won consecutive games to start the season, the No. 12/11 Harvard men’s lacrosse team faced No. 19/17 UMass on Saturday afternoon at Cumnock Turf. The Minutemen got out to an early lead and never relinquished it, defeating the Crimson 7-3. UMass first got on the scoreboard midway through the opening period when senior attacker Jim Connolly sent a pass across the crease to teammate Bobby Hayes. From 15 yards out, Hayes ripped a shot top-shelf past Harvard goaltender Joe Pike. Three minutes later, the Minutemen got another goal. Connolly, the team’s leading scorer, drove from behind the net and fired a low shot into the cage, his first of two goals on the day. Down 2-0, the Crimson answered. Sophomore attacker Dean Gibbons cradled the ball behind the net before circling around the crease, faking high, and sneaking it by UMass goalie Doc Schneider.  Gibbons’ goal would be Harvard’s only score of the half, as Schneider denied the offense time after time. On one play, after the Minuteman defense failed to clear the ball, freshman attacker Kevin Vaughn found junior attacker Jesse Fehr streaking towards the net. From point-blank range, Fehr fired a shot at the lower right corner of the goal, but Schneider made a diving save to knock it away. “[Schneider] played great,” senior co-captain Max Gottschall said. “He made some really good saves and gave their defense a little momentum.” UMass tallied two more goals before the end of the half. On the first, attacker Tim Balise drove from the sideline directly towards the side of the net. He beat his defender to the crease and converted on a diving shot. The other goal came on a scrum in front of the net. As Rory Pedrick was driving towards the crease, the ball was poked out of his stick and into the air. Pike was unaware as the ball bounced precariously near the goal line. Two defenders converged on the ball, but in an attempt to secure the ground ball, it was accidentally knocked into the goal. At the start of the third period, UMass added another goal, this one by attacker Art Kell, to extend its lead to 5-1. “We have a lot of confidence in our defense; we just didn’t play our A game today,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. Facing its largest deficit of the season, the Crimson’s offense came alive. Vaughn assisted senior midfielder Nick Sapia on a one-timer from the right wing, and freshman attacker Jeff Cohen found Gibbons 15 yards in front of the net for a ripped shot past Schneider. Schneider, however, was not to be beaten again. Again and again, whenever Harvard threatened, the Minuteman goalie stymied its attack.  “We ran into a goalie who’s terrific,” Tillman said. “He’s the heart and soul of their team, he’s a four-year guy, he’s one of the best out there, and they feed off his energy.” Schneider finished the day with 14 saves and allowed only three goals, a new career low for the senior. The Minutemen got some insurance after the Crimson’s run. Late in the third period, Connolly earned his second goal when he fired a shot from close range that handcuffed Pike and zipped into the net. Balise tallied his second score early in the fourth period to make the final score 7-3.Seven goals are the most Harvard has allowed this season, and three goals are the fewest it has scored. “The team that played better and deserved to win won,” Tillman said.—Staff writer Timothy J.

The sun was not the only thing shining this weekend. The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (2-1) radiated Saturday afternoon on Cumnock Turf, defeating Quinnipiac, 15-10. Seven different Crimson players contributed to the scoreboard, with five of them recording multiple point efforts.Harvard tallied a 13-10 win over the Bobcats (1-1) last season, and the Crimson now leads the series 5-1 against Quinnipiac.“We were really happy with the win,” tri-captain Shannon Flynn said. “We still have a ways to go but it was a really big step up from our last two games.”Harvard took it to the Bobcats from the first whistle. Sophomore Jess Halpern opened it up for the Crimson with a goal in the first five minutes of the game, off an assist from junior tri-captain Sara Flood. Flood turned around to score two more goals for Harvard, both within the first ten minutes of the game, bringing the score to 3-0. Flood led the Crimson with a career-high seven points against Quinnipiac, scoring four goals and dishing out three assists.The Bobcats’ Nicole Fiore snuck her first of three goals past Harvard with 15 minutes remaining in the half. But the Crimson answered back with four straight goals in five minutes, each tallied by a different player. Flood, tri-captain Sarah Bancroft, Halpern, and freshman Tyler Petropulous each recorded a goal in this stretch, bringing Harvard’s lead to a commanding 7-1.“We’ve been talking about how if you lose the ball, you get it back,” sophomore defender Sam McMahon said. “At one point in the second half, a [Quinnipiac] player checked the ball away from [Halpern] and then she hunted her down, got the ball back, and turned around to score. That really made a stand in the game.”Despite the Crimson’s strength at the start of the match, the Bobcats were able to put in two more goals before the end of the half. Both Quinnipiac goals were scored off free position shots in the final ten minutes of the half, which ended with a score of 7-3.However, Harvard regained its momentum as the new half started. Freshman Chelsey Bowman, Flynn and Halpern each recorded a goal for the Crimson. Bowman’s one-timer goal, off a long, outside pass from Bancroft, was crucial in lifting the energy back up for Harvard.These goals brought the Crimson to its highest point differential of the game at 10-3, but 20 minutes still remained on the clock. The Bobcats promptly responded to the goal deficit, putting three in the back of the net within two minutes to close the gap to 10-6.Shortly after the Quinnipiac resurgence, the Crimson offense was back at the Bobcats’ net. Senior Kaitlin Martin and Petropulous added two more tallies for Harvard, extending the lead to 12-6. Petropulous was key in the victory over Quinnipiac, recording two goals, an assist, and dominating in the draw controls.“We did a really good job with draw controls, which is always critical to the game,” Flynn said. “[Petropulous] had seven draw controls, which was huge for us.”The Bobcats were not able to recover after the Crimson’s final run. They managed to tally four more scores against Harvard, but never closed the deficit to less than four goals. Martin found the back of the net two more times in the final 10 minutes, and Flood finished it off with her fourth goal of the game, and 15th for the Crimson.Freshman Kerry Clark tallied her second win of the season in net, with 10 saves for Harvard.This game also marked the first goal of the season for Flynn and Bancroft, and the first score of Bowman’s career.The Crimson is now focused on two big games this upcoming week against No. 15 University of New Hampshire on Wednesday and Ivy League opponent Brown on Saturday.“Since the UMass game, when we lost, we’ve really focused on hustling and doing the little things right,” McMahon said. “It definitely showed in the first half, getting all the draw controls and ground balls. We also made a stand on defense and really sped up the offense. Things are going well and we’ll continue to work at it.”

The 20th-ranked Harvard men’s swimming and diving team traveled to the 2009 Ivy League Championships at Princeton’s DeNunzio Pool this past weekend to defend its title as Ivy League Champions. They would face tough competition from the hometown Tigers, and despite strong performances from the Crimson, Harvard would have to settle for second place. Crimson junior swimmer Alex Meyer, certainly exhausted by the final stretch of the long and grueling men’s 1650-meter freestyle, pushed past his limits in order to out-touch his main opponent, Princeton sophomore Patrick Briggs, edging him down the final length of the pool in Saturday’s race.Meyer finished first in 15:01.18, a mere 0.81 seconds ahead of Briggs, while Meyer’s teammate, sophomore Blake Lewkowitz, followed closely behind in 15:06.91, fending off another Tiger to take fourth place in the race.“It wasn’t my best time,” Meyer said about his showing.  But the junior took pride in accomplishing what had been one of the Crimson’s main objectives for the weekend—beating Princeton. “I do pretty much anything I can not to let a Princeton swimmer beat me,” Meyer said. Ivy League Championship competition began on Thursday and continued through Saturday with preliminaries raced each morning and finals held in the evenings. The Crimson accumulated 1,311.5 points over the three-day meet to finish second overall in a close battle with the Tigers (1663.5).  Harvard claimed multiple first-place finishes and broke seven meet records on the way to a successful Ivy Championships. The Crimson entered the meet 8-1 on the season with a 6-1 winning record against Ancient Eight opponents and was looking to capture the Ivy League title for the second year running.  Harvard was also seeking revenge against the host team, which previously delivered the Crimson its only loss of the season, 193-160, at the annual HYP meet held at Blodgett Pool a month ago.Harvard senior co-captain Eric Lynch set high standards for the team, opening up Thursday’s finals with a third-place finish in the 500-meter freestyle.  Lynch touched in an NCAA ‘B’ cut time of 4:19.91 that broke the former pool record.The relays also continued to be strong events for Harvard this past weekend.  The Crimson’s 200-meter medley relay team consisting of sophomore Jordan Diekema, junior Simone Melillo, senior Bill Jones and senior David Guernsey cruised to a first place finish in a time of 1:27.61. They notched Harvard’s first win of the meet, breaking the event record previously set by a Crimson quartet in 2006.  The relay team also earned the event’s only All-Ivy first-team selection, swimming what would be one of many NCAA “B” cut times of the meet.Jones followed his performance in the relay with a stellar personal best swim in the 100-meter butterfly on Saturday. The senior finished third in 1:43.24, breaking the previous meet record of 1:44.36 and making an NCAA “B” cut. Jones’ twin brother Dan followed suit, finishing fifth in 1:45.67 for his second NCAA ‘B’ cut time for the day.“I was very pleased with my race,” Bill Jones said.  “It was a really, really fast event this year and I was able to get a best time.” Guernsey swam his own NCAA ‘B’ cut time in the 100-meter freestyle on Saturday.  He clocked in a mark of 43.58 for third place. For Harvard diving, sophomore Zac Ranta took fifth place in the three-meter event on Saturday earning 25 points for the team.  Ranta will compete at the NCAA Zone Diving Championships to be held in Buffalo, N.Y. March 12-14. “We came up a little short of our goal of beating Princeton,” said Jones of the Crimson’s overall performance.  “I think we definitely fought hard throughout the weekend though and carried a lot of energy as a team.”This week, the team waits anxiously to hear whether or not its ‘B’ cut times will be enough to earn individual invitations to the NCAA championships scheduled for March 26-28.

The Harvard fencing team, led by three individual event winners, enjoyed a successful day yesterday at NCAA Northeast Regionals, hosted by MIT. Though no official selections have been made, the Crimson could send as many as nine fencers to NCAAs in two weeks. “I think we have achieved what we set out to do,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “It’s all ended up pretty much the way we anticipated things [would] end up. We’re looking for a positive outcome in the selection process, which will be announced on Tuesday.”The No. 4 women’s team continued its dominant season, taking the top spot in two of the three weapons.In the épeé, freshman Noam Mills and senior Maria Larsson finished 1-2 in the final standings, with senior Lisa Vastola also making the final pool of 12. Mills went a perfect 11-0 in the finals to take the top spot. “That was great,” Crimson co-captain Emily Cross said. “Noam and Maria have been very strong consistently throughout the season. It wasn’t a surprise, but still good.”Cross earned a win of her own in the foil, as the second-seeded fencer led after each of the day’s three rounds and went 10-1 in the final pool.“It’s a long day, and I haven’t been fencing all that much recently,” Cross said. “I viewed this as kind of a warm-up to NCAAs, and I felt like I was fencing well. The fact that I managed to make it through to the end of the day was promising.” Top-seeded Nicole Ross of Columbia was second, but freshman Shelby MacLeod was right behind, taking third place with a 7-4 record in the finals.Freshman standout Caroline Vloka, recovering from pneumonia, was second heading into the final pool in the sabre, but her 7-4 record was only good for fifth place in the final standings. However, with ten fencers advancing to NCAAs from the sabre field, Vloka should have no trouble qualifying for the national tournament.Junior Anna Podlosky and freshman Hayley Levitt also fenced for the Crimson, but were eliminated in the second round of foil and sabre competition, respectively.On the men’s side, an outstanding performance from junior Karl Harmenberg highlighted a solid team showing for No. 9 Harvard.Harmenberg, who was seeded eighth entering competition, won the épeé after going 10-1 in the final round.“It’s an amazing result for Karl,” Brand said. “I’m really happy for him, because he puts so much time and effort into getting better.”Co-captain Benji Ungar, the top seed, wound up in sixth place, and freshman James Hawrot placed ninth. Eight épeé fencers from the Northeast regional will advance to NCAAs. Freshman Valentin Staller continued an impressive rookie season by taking second place in the sabre event. He was tied with top-seeded Daryl Homer of St. John’s, after each posted identical 8-3 records in the final pool, but Homer took home the title in a fence-off.Co-captain Kai Itameri-Kinter was third in the foil, finishing with a 7-4 record in the finals.Sophomore Hao Meng and junior Long Ouyang were both eliminated in the second round of foil competition, and senior Scott DiGiulio failed to advance to the finals in the sabre. The Crimson now waits to hear from the NCAA on Tuesday to determine which of its fencers will advance to compete for a national title. “We anticipate that the top fencers we have will qualify, and overall, we’re looking for some strong individual performances at NCAAs,” Brand said. Though the men will be sending only a few individual stars, the depth of the women’s team—Harvard will likely send five of a possible six fencers to the national championship—will put it in contention for a team title.“I think we’re optimistic,” Cross said. “We’ve got a lot of good shots for individual titles, and I think we can make a strong showing in the team as well.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

For Harvard’s newcomers, the EIWA Championships at the University of Pennsylvania’s Palestra served as a humbling reminder of the depth of Eastern schools. For the veterans, this weekend’s tournament scored them plane tickets to St. Louis for the NCAAs.Three Crimson grapplers advanced to Sunday’s semifinal bouts and the season-ending championships, with junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor and sophomore Corey Janzten taking second, while junior co-captain Louis Caputo notched a third-place finish.Top-seeded O’Connor—also No. 4 in the nation at 157 lbs.—looked to avenge a loss in last year’s 149 lbs. finals, using a fall and two decisions to earn a matchup with No. 5 Jordan Leen of Cornell. Although O’Connor topped the second-seed 7-5 earlier this year, it was Leen’s turn for retribution, as the Big Red senior notched an 8-2 victory in a match that saw O’Connor injured.“It was a dirty match I felt,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss fumed. “[O’Connor] tweaked his knee and the match should’ve been stopped. Now’s he’s banged up and we’ll see how [the knee] reacts.”O’Connor had to grind for much of the tournament, as an early matchup against Columbia’s Derek Sickles required extra time. After a 4-4 tie in regulation, O’Connor showed his determination with an overtime score.“Those [close bouts] are the kind of things that remind you…if you win by a point or by a pin you go to the next round,” junior heavyweight Andrew Knapp said. “And [O’Connor] got it done when it mattered.”No. 4 Jantzen (141) also proved his mettle through gritty matches, improving on a 2008 fourth-place finish. Due to strong performances early in the season, Jantzen found himself atop the bracket in 2009 and justified his seeding. Despite nagging injuries, the young grappler appeared in top form over the two-day tournament, dispatching Cornell’s Corey Manson and Trevor Melde of Rutgers to earn a spot in the decisive bout. Jantzen wrestled hard in the finals as well, but came up on the short end of a 4-3 decision against No. 20 Seth Ciasulli of Lehigh. Regardless, Weiss was pleased with Jantzen’s prospect for a healthy end to the season.“[Jantzen]’s ankle is fine and knock wood he didn’t have a problem all weekend,” Weiss said. “He missed a lot of matches this year and getting into match mode mentally takes a bit [of time], but he’ll be ready for nationals.”Caputo (184) had a strong showing of his own as the tournament’s second seed, cruising through two opening bouts 10-0 and 9-2 to reach Sunday’s semifinal. Unfortunately for the co-captain, he could not top Cornell’s Justin Kerber, as the third seed claimed a 5-3 sudden victory.But rather than imploding after a difficult loss, Caputo displayed his mental toughness with a dominant 10-2 win in the third place bout.While Harvard’s top three competitors earned the majority of the Crimson’s points, the squad enjoyed other quality showings.Although sophomore Andy Olsen (174) and rookies Bryan Panzano (165) and Sean Murphy (197) made quick exits from the talented field, veterans Tommy Picarsic (133) and Knapp (285) pushed deep into the consolation bracket.After using only 6:09 to earn a 15-0 victory in his first bout, Picarsic used his momentum to push top-seeded Joe Baker of Navy to the limit. The Crimson senior competed fiercely to a 4-4 tie before a late third period score gave Baker a 5-4 edge. Picarsic showed no sign of letdown as he closed Saturday with a consolation win, before facing Penn’s Bryan Ortenzio. The Quaker wrestler overcame Picarsic for the second time this year, ending the senior’s season with a 3-1 decision.For his part, Knapp surprised onlookers early with a 3-2 upset of Navy’s fifth-seeded Michael Sprigg. Although Knapp dropped his next bout, the junior earned one more win on the weekend for a 2-2 overall showing.The final Harvard competitor to make a statement was freshman Walter Peppelman (149). The rookie continues to seek that elusive “Big Win,” but rebounded nicely in consolation after falling to top-seeded Matt Kyler of Army, 8-0. Peppelman turned around to dominate Columbia’s Nick Standish 9-0, before facing Penn’s Cesar Grajales, who bested O’Connor in last year’s final. Peppelman battled to the very end, dropping a 1-0 decision to the eventual fifth-place finisher.While many of the Crimson grapplers face the end of their season, all three of Harvard’s NCAA qualifiers will enjoy legitimate chances to win national championships. Even though Caputo, O’Connor, and Jantzen must wait another year to compete for an EIWA crown, they can take ample consolation in knowing that they have one more opportunity to come out on top.—Staff writer Max N.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Track and Field competed hard and yielded some great results in the IC4A and ECAC Championships this past Saturday and Sunday. Of the men, who competed in the 20-event IC4A Championships at Boston University’s track, standouts included sprinter John Dingus and pole vaulter Nico Weiler, both freshmen.Dingus qualified for the finals of the 400-meter dash, finishing ninth overall at 48:19 and breaking his own school record. He finished eighth in the finals at 49:43. Weiler finished his event impressively at first overall, vaulting 5.00 meters. The rookie was pleased with his performance, but felt that he could have done better.“I did alright,” Weiler said. “It was a pretty even competition. I’m not too happy that I didn’t make the qualifying for nationals, but I was glad that I won.”Weiler won the competition, narrowly edging Connecticut College’s Kyle Duggan.“We were both really tired, so I guess that’s just how it played out,” Weiler said.Not qualifying was a disappointment to someone who has enjoyed so much success in such a short time. In 2006, Weiler was the Under-18 world champion in pole vaulting. In 2008, Weiler was the EA Sports Scholar-Athlete of the Year and was named to the All-USA team by USA Today.Harvard sophomore Sean Gil finished eighth, matching his personal best by clearing 4.80 meters.Distance-running sophomore Dan Chenoweth followed his Heptagonals title in the 3000-meter by finishing second overall on Saturday with a time of 8:06.64, just two seconds shy of his personal best.The weight-throw event proved to be very productive for Harvard competitors. Though there were no overall winners from the Crimson, many athletes achieved their best college results. Senior thrower Neville Irani achieved a personal best in the weight throw, finishing 11th with 17.65 meters. Sophomore thrower Ablorde Ashigbi topped his previous personal best by over two meters, throwing 16.62 meters. Junior Jack Brady also showed improvement, throwing a career-high 16.48 meters.“Overall, I was really pleased with the way that the team competed,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.The women’s ECAC Championships, which is a meet mainly for individual rather than team competition, also took place this past Saturday and Sunday, at the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Complex in Boston.“It’s been a very long indoor season,” said hurdler Dara Wilson, who lead the Ivies last week in the 60-meter hurdles with an 8.76-second finish. “I think, given all of those things, [Saturday] was a pretty strong day for us.”Harvard senior hurdlers Shannon Flahive and Dara Wilson both finished the 60-meter hurdles at 8.84 seconds in the opening day of competition.Sophomore distance runner Jamie Olson finished sixth place in the one mile run at 4:55.88, which qualified her for Sunday’s final. She improved by shaving critical seconds off of her previous time, finishing sixth on Sunday at 4:52.59. Sophomore runner Hilary May finished second in the 1000-meter run, at 2:50.46. Crimson runners ended with positive results across many events, coming in third in the distance medley and sixth in the 4x400-meter relay.Senior high jumper Becky Christensen, among the best in the nation at her event, won the high jump event by clearing 1.85 meters. Senior high jumper Dina Emde finished seventh, clearing 1.65 meters.Overall, Harvard finished seventh in the team rankings on Sunday.  Though some veterans shined individually, the women are also looking to the future excitedly. The track and field team has many talented freshmen and sophomores on both the men’s and women’s sides, so the graduating seniors will leave a legacy to be continued.“We have a lot of young freshman who are really great,” Wilson said. “The quality of the team is improving exponentially.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—This is what is referred to as “going out on a high note.”In the final game of the Harvard men’s basketball season—which doubled as the last games of the collegiate careers of seniors Andrew Pusar, Drew Housman, and Evan Harris—the Crimson turned in one of its best performances of the season to down archrival Yale, 69-59, at John J. Lee Amphitheatre on Saturday.The triumph over the Bulldogs (13-15, 8-6 Ivy) was especially sweet for the three seniors, as Harvard (14-14, 6-8 Ivy) had lost its last seven games in the rivalry—a drought that began with the senior class’s freshman campaign. The win was also the first for the team at Yale since the final game of the 1998-99 season and avenged an 87-66 beating at Lavietes Pavilion last month.“It feels great,” forward Harris said. “I was 0-for-7, Drew was 0-for-7, Andy was 0-for-7 against Yale, and it’s been a while since we won here, so it feels great. Especially, not to be mean, but seeing that it was their senior night, these are the kinds of games you come to Harvard for: your rival, on their senior night, coming off a poor loss last night, it just feels great to get a win, especially to end your season with a win.”Harris and point guard Housman each put in one of the finest games of the year in their curtain closer, while Pusar the captain hurt his ankle in the opening minute and could only play three minutes. Harris went 34 minutes and pulled down a team-high seven rebounds along with six points and three steals. When he fouled out with under a minute left, he received a great reception from the bench.Housman continued his consistent dominance with 15 points—one of four Harvard players in double figures—and a game-high six assists. Junior guard Jeremy Lin had a game-best 19 points, with 14 of those in the second half, passing the 1000-point mark for his career, while freshmen guard Oliver McNally and forward Keith Wright tallied 16 and 11 respectively.One of Housman’s hoops came at the end of the first half. With his team down one, he brought the ball up, drove the lane, and threw up a shot that rattled in at the buzzer, giving his guys a 33-32 lead at the break. The stage looked set for a nail-biting second half, but the Crimson would not follow the script.“We had twenty minutes left in our season,” Harris said. “We felt bad for Andy because he couldn’t really go in the second half, and we all huddled up when the half started and wanted to do it for him and the seniors, and we held on and pushed it out.”Indeed, after falling behind 36-35 almost two minutes in, McNally hit a three off a pass from Housman on the next possession, and Harvard would not lose the lead after that. Making 14-of-24 shots after the break and stifling the Bulldogs on defense into nine second-half turnovers, the lead was pushed to 10 at 53-43 halfway through the half. Twice Yale cut the lead to single digits, but was severely limited in opportunities, as Housman, Lin, and McNally took excellent care of the basketball and milked the clock on every Crimson possession. Two straight baskets by Lin around the five minute mark—the first a steal and fast-break layup, the second a driving acrobatic three-point play—gave the team its largest lead, and the seniors were on their way to savoring a great final victory.“It was really awesome,” said Housman, who finishes his career 12th on the program’s all-time scoring list. “I feel like I came full-circle. The first time we played up here freshman year, I had an awful game, and we lost. It was nice to play well and get this victory. I’m now 1-7 in my career against Yale, instead of 0-8.”The win gives the seniors their best Ivy record in their four years. It also left the team at .500 for the season, the first time it posted a non-losing mark since 2001-’02.“I think this is a huge step forward,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “To be able to finish .500, not having a losing season, and to finish the way we were able to finish tonight here on the road, I think this is a huge step forward to where we want to go,”—Staff writer Ted Kirby can be reached at tjkirby@fas.harvard.edu.

Berryline, a favorite among Harvard Square treats (and the alternative food source of many an undergrad), might not go by the name “Berryline” any longer. The store is planning to expand adding a second location between Harvard Square and Porter’s Square across from the law school and wants a name that is going to represent their unique brand, said one of the owners, Pok Yang.
To find a new name, Berryline will be hosting a contest asking customers to submit suggestions from now until Aprill 11th. The winner will get his or her pick of prizes which include a Nintendo Wii, and iPod, or a $1000 donation to a charity of choice and $100 gift certificate to Berryline (approximately 41 small Berrylines with no toppings).
But Berryline retains the right to keep their name if they do not see any suggestion that “they really like,” said Yang. So what are the clues to a winning entry? “We serve other fruit beside berries,” Yang said, “Perhaps some other [fruit] might work better.”

Adams residents who were at Junior Parents Weekend lunch on Saturday (especially those with doting Mom and Dad in tow) had the chance to score some whimsical House privileges—and the chance to stay in the restored FDR suite during next year’s commencement.
The Adams House auction, which featured live bidding and musical performances by students, is an annual fundraiser for HoCo that was first held last year.
“There’s a quote in the old Masters handbook that says something to the effect of: Allow something once, and it’s precedent.  Allow it twice, and it’s tradition.  I suppose this would be classified as a tradition,” said former HoCo Chair Omar Abdelsamad.
The auction, which was not limited to only juniors and their parents, took place the dining hall, which current HoCo Co-Chair Amol Jain said was filled to capacity.
So, just what prized possessions were being auctioned off?  Check out the goods, including a chance to pie either of the House Masters Judy or Sean Palfrey, after the jump.
•	The chance to pie either House Masters Judy or Sean Palfrey.
•	Dinner with the House Masters.
•	Breakfast in bed, cooked and delivered by the Adams house elves—dressed in elf costumes.
•	Three original poetry broadsides—including one signed by visiting poet Richard Tillinghast—from the Bow and Arrow Press, Adams’s in-house printing press.
•	Personalized graduation announcements, also printed at the Bow and Arrow Press.
•	The chance for parents to stay at the FDR suite for five days during next year’s commencement.
Jain wouldn’t comment on who won what, or how much each prize cost, but we do know that Zachary C. Sifuentes, an Adams House tutor and resident poet, won the right to pie House Master Sean Palfrey.
“I bid on the auction with the sole intent of upping the bid—but I ended up with it,” Sifuentes said. “I think I'm going to give it away as a prize for some strange competition in the House.  We'll see.”

Tonight marks the Jewish holiday Purim, which celebrates the Jewish peoples' deliverance from oppression during the ancient Persian Empire. But unlike most religious holidays, this day is celebrated with parties--and in costume. More info on Harvard celebrations after the jump.
The members of Harvard Chabad invite you to join them for:
The CRIMSON ABSOLUT PURIM BASH - Mon @ 9PM
Sanctum, Harvard Crimson - 14 Plympton Street (note:  navel gazing!!)
Megillah Reading followed by Live Music, Hot Food, and an Awesome Time!
And here I thought Passover was the Jewish holiday to get shickered (Yiddish: tipsy) on Manishevitz.
“(The name) indicates that this party is the real deal,” said Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi of Chabad.
Tonight’s bash will feature a reading of the Purim story, multimedia slide show, music, and of course noshing (Yiddish: social eating). Students will be given the opportunity to fulfill the mitzvahs (Hebrew: commandment, connotation—good deed) of Purim which include giving gifts to friends, giving charity to the poor, and hearing the story of Purim.
The story of the holiday goes something like this: Esther the beautiful marries into the harem of Persian King Achashveirosh (365 BCE), where she uses her influence over the king to save the Jewish people from the King’s evil advisor Hamen (namesake of those delicious triangular jam-filled cookies), who wants to kill the Jewish people for having their own unique traditions and values.
One unique tradition of seniors is to dress up as their theses when they go to Hillel, how meshugee (Yiddish: slang, crazy). If you have a prisoner’s suit or bright orange clothes, Peter N. Ganong ’09 could use your help, says one Adams Schmooze e-mail thread.
Other Purim activities on campus include Hillel’s Purim Palooza (9-11pm Beren Hall, Harvard Hillel) and Chabad’s brunches around campus.
