After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the 2009 federal stimulus plan helped prevent a global depression, America still feels the pinch of hard times. Unemployment hovers around 10 percent and the country’s GDP remains significantly below 2007 levels. With this in mind, the Congress should welcome Obama’s recent suggestions for renewed efforts to stimulate the economy.
Last Tuesday, President Obama delivered a speech to the Brookings Institute outlining major proposals to promote job growth. These initiatives included small-business tax credits, the use of  $200 billion left over from Troubled Assets Relief Program funds to support business hiring, and increased public infrastructure spending.  The most novel initiative is a new tax credit to promote energy-efficient homes that will hopefully invigorate the green jobs sector.
While the original stimulus bill provided much-needed relief for a staggering economy, Obama is right to assert that we must “not let up in our efforts to take every responsible action to get the economy growing.” These proposals represent exactly the sort of responsible spending needed to bring back economic prosperity.
By funneling the money left over from TARP funds toward businesses’ hiring credits, the government will hopefully bring down the remarkably high unemployment rate.  According to Obama’s plan, tax credits will be given to industries that employ a certain number of low-skilled workers who would otherwise likely be fired as a result of the economic downturn. Historically, similar plans to keep workers employed during recessions have worked. The 1977 New Jobs Tax Credit was immediately followed by an 11.2 percent rise in employment—a record for the United States at the time. And there’s no reason to believe that it won’t work again. John Bishop, an economics professor at Cornell University, predicts that Obama’s proposal will have great success and increase employment by 2.8 million by the end of 2010.
In addition, the eco-friendly homes tax credit, affectionately labeled “cash for caulkers,” serves the dual goals of economic stimulus and environmental reform. The program, a brainchild of John Doerr, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, and Bill Clinton, would give households anywhere from $2,000 to 4,000 to pay for weatherization projects. This stimulus is beautifully effective—homeowners are incentivized to carry out renovation projects that generate job growth and create more environmentally friendly homes. By combining green initiatives with fiscal stimulus, Obama’s proposal kills two important birds with one stone.
And unlike the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which many accused of being an agglomeration of pork-barrel projects, Obama’s new proposals have a national focus.  They represent efficient use of federal funds to provide much-needed stimulus to an economy that still isn’t back on its feet.
The president’s political opponents have denounced excessive spending and claim that additional stimulus will only swell the budget deficit further. To an extent these critics are correct—further domestic spending will make Obama’s goal of halving the deficit by 2010 even more unlikely.
However, many of these proposals are funded through money that is already legislated for use, and, given the economic realities of the moment, encouraging job growth is far more important than fiscal prudence. The government should look to break the grip of the recession and reject calls to curb necessary domestic spending.

If we are lauding the Obama administration (and awarding it the Nobel Peace Prize) for “change,” then perhaps we should equally shake up our holiday traditions. In holiday seasons past, many of us have grown accustomed to shopping for gifts only for ourselves and those close to us. This year, let’s have Santa re-direct our Christmas presents to help President Obama get a jump-start on his proposed initiatives—those who are able should take a new approach to presents this year by donating time or money to a charity or cause that helps further the “change” we’ve come to believe in.
President Obama has proposed new stimulus packages for working Americans and aims to create five million new jobs. While everyone seems to be tightening their belts on spending this holiday, you won’t break the bank by similarly helping someone with their business. According to the World Bank, nearly one and a half billion people survive on less than $1.25 a day. Whether it be helping a basket-weaver in Ecuador or a sheep-herder in Kazakhstan, the organization Kiva.org allows you to play banker by investing small amounts of money in someone’s start-up business on the other side of the globe. Alternatively, you can support the economy and help a family in a developing country by buying them a farm animal through Heifer International. The animal you donate will help provide food and income for the family, which is a great way to spread and recycle the wealth.
Obama has promised accessible and affordable health care for all—including the 47 million Americans who are uninsured.  Help Obama help those who don’t have health care by donating your time, skills, or money to local clinics that provide health care to those in need. Doctors Without Borders is a network of 25,000 committed individuals in over 60 countries providing medical care to people are threatened by violence, catastrophes, and epidemics. Help Doctors Without Borders continue its work by giving someone an e-card or a Tribute Contribution in his or her honor. The person will receive a letter of his or her honorary contribution to the cause, and you will get a tax break for the philanthropic present.
Another Obama initiative is to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050. He plans to do this by investing heavily in the development of alternative fuel resources. While many speculate that this is an unattainable goal, no one can argue that we need to take better care of our planet. Go “green” this year and give presents that give back to the environment. Help cut down on fuel consumption by forgoing plastic water bottles—it takes 1.5 billion barrels of oil per year to meet America’s demands for plastic water bottles and 20 years for them to decompose in a landfill. A stainless-steel water-bottle would be a great alternative to bottle up the beverages. Kleen Kanteen and Swigg manufacture reusable stainless steel water bottle makers, so you don’t have to worry about mountains of trash and bisephonal-A leaching into your drinking water. You can also literally “go green” by buying someone a tree to plant or using recycled wrapping paper to package your presents.
Obama is trying to reform education by attracting and retaining high-quality teachers, making preschool universally available and making college affordable to all. America currently ranks 21 out of 27 among advanced economy countries in high-school completion rates—currently 67 percent, down from 77 percent in the 1970s. We can help the children reach for the stars by helping teachers fund classroom projects. The website DonorsChoose.org allows you to give to different classroom projects or needs that teachers list online. Students and teachers will send a personal thank you. You can also donate old computers and books to schools in need, or help sponsor a child’s education, on websites like SavetheChildren.org.
While we will all be waiting to see if Obama lives up to the promise of the Nobel Peace Prize with the undertakings in motion, we should also hold ourselves accountable for “change” and make an impact—no matter how big or small—on some of the things we hope to improve. Whether it be donating time, money, or effort, giving philanthropic presents rather than materialistic ones will reap benefits for long after the holiday season has passed. While only time will tell if Obama is the “change we can believe in,” it’s also true that—as another wise leader once said—“You must be the change you wish to see in the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than one year ago, Israel launched its attack on Gaza, in which over 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed. According to the report of the U.N. Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, headed by preeminent South African jurist Justice Richard Goldstone, Israel deliberately targeted civilians during the attack.  Among other things, Israeli forces deliberately targeted educational institutions, destroying or damaging at least 280 schools and kindergartens during the war.
The devastating impact on Gaza’s schools should be of special concern to an institution dedicated to education such as Harvard.  Instead, on November 23 Harvard extended an invitation to Michael B. Oren—the Israeli ambassador to the United States—to speak at the Kennedy School. Fittingly, he was rejected by students who attended the event. Oren is a former officer and paratrooper who served as an Israeli army spokesperson during the unwarranted and illegal attacks on Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2009.
While the university envisioned a warm reception, it must be recorded that the students took a clear stance against impunity for war crimes.  During the question-and-answer session, the vast majority of questions and comments leveled at Oren were critical of his actions and statements on the Gaza invasion and the Goldstone report.
One student read a quote by Oren in which he compared the Goldstone report to the Holocaust.  She then asked, “Why do you make such hyperbolic statements?  Don’t you think it cheapens the memory of Jews killed?”  Oren denied making the statement, which he wrote in an article for The New Republic. Many other questions and statements equally rattled Oren. Students showed that they are unwilling to stay silent when a uniformed spin doctor tries to rewrite recent history.
There is a difference between offering an argumentative viewpoint as a public citizen and doing so as a state official and army officer defending alleged war crimes. The university is a place to exchange ideas, including difficult and occluded ones. However, the appropriate venue to defend war crimes is the International Criminal Court at The Hague, not at Harvard University.
Justice Goldstone told the U.N. Human Rights Council that “the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point.”  Rather than hold Israel accountable, the Harvard Middle East Initiative provided one of its official spokesmen a platform to defend the indefensible actions of “Operation Cast Lead.” Oren jokingly quoted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman and others as telling him that he will have “a very hard job” as Israel’s ambassador.
Surprisingly, I agreed with them. Indeed, Oren, who defends the bombing of schools, universities, and factories and the illegal use of white phosphorous among countless other crimes, has a challenge ahead of him. Defending the destruction of Palestinian life as a necessary form of security strategy can’t be easy, especially since collective punishment is outlawed by international law.
It is particularly ironic and disturbing that Oren, who was a visiting professor at Harvard in 2006, could justify the destruction of academic life and the continued ban on school supplies to Gaza’s students.  Israel also bans Palestinian students in Gaza from studying abroad.  In May 2008, Palestinian students who received Fulbright scholarships were not allowed to leave Gaza because of Israel’s crippling siege.  Israel’s systematic denial of Palestinians’ basic human and civil rights should be confronted, not legitimized, by academic institutions.
It is imperative that Harvard adopt principled guidelines and vetting practices to ensure that war criminals and their official apologists—regardless of country of origin—not be given a platform at our university. By welcoming those whose actions deny students in Palestine their academic freedom, the university inevitably trivializes the struggle for human rights and collective freedom.

Today is the eighth day of the Copenhagen climate negotiations.  Representatives from 190 countries have come together to try and craft a political solution to the problem of climate change.  It is, in many respects, the high-water mark of the environmental movement.  Copenhagen is not the first time that countries have come together to attempt to solve environmental issues—this has happened with varying degrees of success many times—but it has received the most attention.  With this attention come the highest expectations of an environmental summit to date.
Yet this summit is primarily political.  In fact, to date, the environmental movement as a whole has been primarily political.  It has embraced command and control protections, opting to direct actions rather than to change outlooks.  Many of the solutions being discussed at Copenhagen fit this model.  However, some representatives at Copenhagen do not represent countries.  Instead, they are there to represent the world’s major religions.
This is the second time in as many months that many of these figures have come together.  The first was at a conference specifically for religious leaders in the beginning of November in preparation for Copenhagen.  However, this conference had a twist.  Participants were only invited if they had already begun to take concrete steps to improve the environment.  These include the Jewish representative’s commitment to cut meat consumption among the Jewish community by 50 percent by 2015 and the Baptist plan to increase environmental education among youth in Baltimore.  Each of these commitments is in some way related to the fundamental tenants of the respective religions.  But what is important about these commitment—and what separates them from the commitments that may come out of Copenhagen—is that these are primarily commitments to change lifestyles.  Not just to cap emissions from churches or to print Bibles on recycled paper (although they did commit to that), these commitments are more fundamental and involve every member of these respective religious communities—they are changes that people can participate in and that will make a real difference.
Command and control solutions to environmental problems may be necessary, but they will not be sufficient.  As a result, the lifestyle changes that the religious leaders of the world are beginning to promote are just as important as anything that comes out of Copenhagen.  Many of these religious leaders have recognized that their respective creeds place a religious obligation on their followers to take action to protect the environment.  It is time that environmental leaders put aside their own religions—or, as may be the case, lack thereof—and embrace the potential of the religious world to protect the environment.
To some degree, as the conference in November demonstrates, this has already happened.  But it will take more than just a single conference or participation at Copenhagen.  For a very long time, the environmental movement has marginalized the religious world.  But as environmental problems become increasingly complex and call for more and more solutions based in lifestyle changes, the need for help from world religions will continue to grow.  Religion offers an avenue into people’s lives that the government simply cannot hope to match.  For many, it may often be the case that, while the government controls what you can do, religion personally inspires and motivates you to act on behalf of certain causes.  To solve the environmental problem facing the world, people must want to solve it, not be forced to solve it.  Thus, the engagement of religious leaders is vital for the success of environmental protection.
The problems the environmental movement faces are not new.  Martin Palmer, secretary general of the Alliance for Religion and Conservation, notes that, at its heart, climate change is an issue of “sin, greed, selfishness and foolishness.”  In other words, an issue involving the same elements of humanity that religion has been dealing with for centuries.  It is time for the environmental movement to put aside its lack of religion and embrace the support of religious leaders worldwide.  It would be foolish not to. Yes, the hopes of the world’s environmental leaders are staked on Copenhagen, but, in the end, it will likely be the religious leaders there who make the greatest difference.

An avid lover of the outdoors, Paul J. Zofnass ’69 has made a $500,000 donation to the Harvard Museum of Natural History—the largest gift the Museum has received since its inception in 1998—for a new exhibit depicting the interactions that take place in a New England forest ecosystem.
The Zofnass exhibit will be the first to incorporate elements from the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum, which jointly employ the Museum of Natural History as their public gallery, according to MCZ Director James Hanken.
The exhibit, entitled “New England Forests: The Zofnass Family Gallery,” is set to open in the spring of 2011. It seeks to make visitors feel as though they are actually walking on a curvy path through the forest, Hanken said.
Zofnass, an alumnus of Harvard Business School and the Law School as well as the College, said he is pleased that the display’s unique setup will be markedly different from traditional exhibits that showcase preserved animals behind panes of glass.
“It’s more interesting, it’s more novel, and more informative,” Hanken said.
A member of the Harvard University Center on the Environment—a network of University affiliates that encourages environmental research and education—Zofnass said he is excited to stay involved with the plans for the new exhibit.
“This little exhibit is simply one little step for Harvard in what it’s done in the past for the environment,” said Zofnass, who is the president and founder of the Environmental Financial Consulting Group Inc., a New York City firm that advises environmental and engineering/consulting firms.
“I really hope that [the youth] will take away a deep appreciation for how important our natural environment is,” Zofnass said. “The woods, the woodlands, the New England forests—it’s kind of all around us. What I’m hopeful is that kids and visitors see how these processes interact with each other, support each other, and better appreciate that you really need to keep it.”
Hanken said that Zofnass’ donation will help Harvard to improve the Museum of Natural History by integrating current events in the scientific field and showcasing the research of Harvard faculty.
As a way to share his love for the environment, Zofnass said he began developing the land adjacent to his barn outside New York City into a land trust preserve in 1985. In 2001, he opened the Westchester Wilderness Walk, a 150-acre sanctuary that includes a 10-mile trail.
“We were surrounded by woods, and I made it a mission of mine to preserve as much of it as I could,” he said.
Zofnass said he has fond memories of growing up in Belmont, Mass. and walking through the forest on his route to and from middle school. He said he hopes that this new exhibit will also have a lasting impact on young visitors.

Former Kennedy School professor Keith G. Allred announced last Thursday his intention to run as the Democratic candidate in the 2010 race for the governorship of Idaho.
The self-described “dynamic centrist” said he hopes that his moderate stances and ability to work across party lines will give him an edge in the race toward the top political spot in the “red state.”
“It’s not very typical for a former Harvard professor to run for public office in Idaho, and it creates a bit of stir,” Allred said. “But I’m a fifth generation Idahoan. I grew up working summers on my family cattle ranch. It makes me an interesting combination.”
“It’s true that he has an Ivy League education,” said Betty H. Richardson, Allred’s campaign manager. “But it would be hard to find someone who is more Idaho than Keith Allred.”
During his time at Harvard, Allred was active in bringing his interest in Idaho to
Joseph P. Kalt, who worked with Allred on negotiations between a Native American tribe in Idaho and the local government. After leaving Harvard in 2003, Allred brought his work back to Idaho through the formation of a non-partisan citizen’s group.
Known as The Common Interest, the group brings together over 1,000 Idahoans of diverse political backgrounds to form policy recommendations. Allred said yesterday that his work with The Common Interest has given him a reputation for reaching across party lines and noted that the governorship would allow him to more effectively continue this project.
“I’m dedicated, independent, committed to finding practical solutions that rise above partisan relations,” Allred said. “I think that good ideas and good people come from across the political spectrum.”
The Democratic Party’s support of Allred’s bi-partisan approach encouraged him to join the race, he said. The former professor said he was concerned that the recent Republican governments have not reflected the views of the 60 to 65 percent of Idahoans who consider themselves moderates.
“It’s become increasingly unrepresentative of the constituency of Idaho,” he said, adding that the strong conservative stance of the Republican party has “opened a window for a Democrat, as long as that Democrat is a moderate.”
One of the major focuses of Allred’s campaign will be to prevent the domination of special interest groups—a concern he said stemmed from his work at the Kennedy School.
Allred said special interests have overshadowed the current administration in his state, causing the needs of ordinary citizens to become a secondary concern. The incumbent Governor C.L. “Butch” Otter is Allred’s expected opponent in the general election if Allred wins the Democratic primary.
Allred intends to move tax breaks away from special interests like heavy trucking—which Otter has supported—and towards small businesses in order to better stimulate job creation and overall economic growth.
“He’s been dedicated to Idaho from the time he was growing up. He knows more about the politics of Idaho than anyone I know,” Kalt said. “I think he’s cut out for the job.”

Travelers in the midst of the current H1N1 pandemic and flu season are taking significantly more health precautions against contracting and spreading the disease, according to a recent Harvard School of Public Health poll.
“These results are telling us that Americans are taking action, suggesting that they are getting the public health message,” said HSPH research scientist Gillian K. SteelFisher, who is the assistant director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program, the HSPH research group that conducted the poll.
The survey revealed that most Americans are concerned about contracting the flu on airplanes, as opposed to other modes of transportation, such as the bus, train, or cruise ship. According to the poll, 76 percent of travelers said that they would take hand sanitizer with them on flights—a 15 percent increase from last year.
The survey also found that 81 percent of respondents would choose to sneeze into their elbow as opposed to their hands, in an increase from the 64 percent figure determined last year.
“These are important public health measures to prevent spread of disease for them and the people around them,” SteelFisher said.
More than 75 percent of travelers polled said that they would postpone or cancel their next trip if they were sick with a fever. But SteelFisher said she finds it troubling that the remaining quarter of those surveyed indicated that being sick would not change their travel plans.
“Fever, coughing, sneezing are definite symptoms of contagiousness,” SteelFisher said, adding that traveling while afflicted with symptoms merely exacerbates the spread of the disease.
Some Harvard students said that they are taking preventative measures before travelling—such as purchasing hand sanitizer and medication—to ensure their safety.
“I don’t think it hurts to be too cautious,” said Yuying Luo ’12, who will be traveling in China for three weeks. Luo said she is scheduled to receive an H1N1 vaccination.
But several students expressed only mild concern regarding the H1N1 pandemic, stating that it would not deter them from travelling.
“Whenever you travel, all kinds of things can get in the way, like food poisoning,” said Jason W. Schnier ’11, who will be visiting Israel and other parts of the Middle East over January. He added that he was not “terribly concerned” about going abroad because of the ready accessibility of hospitals in the areas he was visiting.
“People from developing countries have pretty good immune systems, so I’m not personally going to freak out over this outbreak,” said Laila Kasuri ’13, who feels that the severity of the H1N1 pandemic has been exaggerated and plans to spend her break at home in Pakistan.
The recent HSPH poll is sixth in a series of surveys conducted by the Harvard Opinion Research Program to examine public opinion regarding the H1N1 outbreak.
The first survey—which was released in May, weeks after the virus first made its appearance in the U.S.—found that nearly half of Americans were concerned that they or their family members would fall victim to the H1N1 flu.
Since then, the polls have tracked Americans’ views on the perceived risk of the virus and vaccinations.
“The most important thing is that we’re going to keep on tracking...to see how people’s experiences change as more evidence rolls out,” SteelFisher said.

In light of the Copenhagen Climate Summit, Cambridge called to order its own Climate Emergency Congress, convening over 150 community members Saturday to discuss the potential climate challenges facing the city.
Delegates—representing a wide range of ages, socioeconomic statuses, and occupations—attended the Climate Congress in order to provide specific recommendations to the City Council for how residents, businesses, and institutions can adopt more environmentally friendly practices.
In her opening speech, Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons said that 10 years have elapsed since the city first publicly acknowledged the consequences of climate change. This past May, the Cambridge City Council officially recognized climate change as an “emergency,” and plans to hold a city-wide climate congress has been in the works since Thanksgiving.
“We all understand that tackling the climate crisis is an ambitious venture,” Simmons said. “It is going to take a sustained effort on all our parts.”
During the congress, delegates divided into small groups to discuss tangible solutions to the climate emergency. Recommendations included eliminating all street parking by 2020, raising the price of parking permits, and working with nearby institutions to research and publish reports on green initiatives in an effort to educate the public.
The congress also featured various Cambridge officials as speakers, including city councillor Henrietta S. Davis, who will represent the city of Cambridge at the Copenhagen summit. At the Cambridge Climate Congress, attendees were also given the opportunity to submit ideas for Davis to consider while she is in Copenhagen for the international talks.
“This Congress showed that it is possible to have this conversation with people from different backgrounds to find what we have in common and what we can agree on,” said Quinton Y. Zondervan, a member of the steering committee that organized the Congress and founder of a biotechnology company that advises the City Manager on climate issues.
“[We’re here] to create a feasible future for ourselves, our children, and our grandchildren,” said Steve Morr-Wineman, a board member of the Cambridge Home Energy Efficiency Team. “Step out of the box of hopelessness and really believe we can make a difference.”
He pointed to the Harvard University Office for Sustainability—which aims to decrease the University’s carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2010—as an example of good goal-setting.
“We need to look at what we can start getting done now, as people who are coming together to make a movement,” Wineman said.
According to Zondervan, the most important point to take away from Saturday’s Congress is the efficacy of devising short-term goals and integrating them into long-term plans.
The public will vote to finalize recommendations made to the City Council and the Cambridge community at a follow-up congress on Jan. 23, 2010.
Recognizing that tangible changes can happen gradually through small steps, Simmons said that she has already made personal changes in her life by teaching her children to behave in more sustainable ways.
She and her children ride bicycles, have changed their fluorescent light bulbs, and have asked their building managers to use programmable thermostats.
In 1999, Cambridge was the 55th community to join the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, an international association of local governments that have made a commitment to sustainable development. Today, there are a few hundred communities involved in the United States and a few thousand internationally.
“The hard work does not end [today],” Simmons said. “We need you all to act as ambassadors from the Congress in the next month.”

The consumption of coffee and vigorous exercise may have a hand in decreasing the risk of prostate cancer, according to separate findings recently presented by two researchers affiliated with the Harvard School of Public Health.
Kathryn M. Wilson, a research fellow in the epidemiology department at HSPH, found a correlation between the consumption of coffee and a decreased risk of the cancer, which afflicts more men than any other cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, Stacey A. Kenfield, a research associate in the department, determined that vigorous exercise may reduce the risk of mortality due to the same disease.
For her study, Wilson tracked the coffee consumption habits of 50,000 men ranging in age from their mid-50s to mid-70s, finding that men who regularly drank coffee over the 20-year span of the study developed advanced prostate cancer at a lower rate than non-coffee drinkers.
Subjects who reported consuming six or more cups of coffee every day were found to have a 60 percent lower chance of advanced or lethal prostate cancer than those who did not drink coffee. Both regular and decaffeinated coffee elicited the same results.
The study also found that men who drink large amounts of coffee are more likely to smoke, exercise less, and be overweight—factors that have been shown to increase the risk of prostate cancer. Wilson said these findings added support to her belief that coffee itself—and not, for instance, the life style choices related to the drink—may be responsible for the link between coffee consumption and the lower risk of prostate cancer.
But Wilson said that the study did not investigate the reasons behind the coffee-cancer connection.
“You can’t really say that this is a direct cause-and-effect relationship,” Wilson said, adding that she thinks the results may be somehow related to coffee’s association with a lower risk of Type II diabetes.
Other studies have shown that drinking coffee potentially decreases the risk of liver and endometrial cancer as well, according to Wilson. But despite all the potential benefits of coffee, more research needs to be done before people are encouraged to reevaluate their drinking choices, Wilson said.
“I don’t think there is a reason to change your coffee drinking habits in either direction,” she said.
Kenfield’s study—which followed 2,686 men who had already been diagnosed with prostate cancer and quantified their exercise habits after their diagnoses—found that vigorous activity decreased the risk of mortality due to prostate cancer.
Those who participated in non-vigorous activities equivalent to about 30 minutes of jogging, biking, or swimming per week, saw a 35 percent reduction in overall mortality, according to Kenfield. But these exercises had no measurable effect on the risk of mortality due to prostate cancer.
By contrast, those who participated in vigorous activities experienced a 12 percent decreased risk of mortality specifically due to prostate cancer. Kenfield said she plans to do more research to determine the cause of the results, focusing on insulin pathways and insulin growth factors.
Though the causality of the study’s results has yet to be determined, Kenfield said that the positive health benefits attributed to exercise make it a sensible habit for men with prostate cancer to adopt.
Wilson and Kenfield presented their findings last Monday in Houston at the American Association for Cancer Research’s “Frontiers in Cancer Prevention” Research Conference.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow James R. Houghton ’58, who played a key role in the resignation of University President Lawrence H. Summers and presided over the appointment his successor, Drew G. Faust, will leave his post on the University’s top governing board at the end of the current academic year.
Robert D. Reischauer ’63, who joined the Corporation as a fellow in 2002 after concluding his six-year term on the Board of Overseers, will succeed Houghton as senior fellow, according to a University announcement of Houghton's decison released Monday afternoon.
With nearly a deacde and a half of service, Houghton is twice over the most senior member of the Corporation—the six-person body that oversees and advises Harvard’s president. He joined the board in 1995 and became its senior fellow in 2002.
Houghton is also an active member of several boards of directors of various companies, and the current chairman of the board of trustees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Upon graduating from Harvard Business School in 1962, Houghton spent much of his professional career at Corning Incorporated—a maker of specialty glass and ceramics—where he eventually rose to the top posts of chairman and CEO in in 1983, and again in 2002.
Houghton confirmed his plans for departure to his Corporation colleagues at their Dec. 7 gathering, wishing to make his announcement before the end of the month to jump-start the search for a replacement next year, according to the release.
In compliance with the University’s charter, the Corporation elects any new Corporation member with the counsel and approval of the Board of Overseers—Harvard’s second highest governing body. A joint committee of the Corporation and the Board will soon begin a search to fill the vacancy to be left by Houghton.
“It’s been a true honor to have been able to serve Harvard over the years,” Houghton is quoted in the release. “I believe that today, under the leadership of our distinguished president and with support from our other constituencies, the future of our ‘fair Harvard’ is bright indeed.”
“I’ve been around Harvard for more than 50 years, through challenge and change, and the wealth of talent in our community never ceases to amaze me,” added the former Lowell House history concentrator and active member of the A.D. final club, whose visage hangs on the wall of the upstairs bar room in the club’s house to this day.
Even before Houghton’s arrival on campus as an undergraduate, his family’s long-standing legacy at the school had already created a visible imprint—Houghton Library, the University’s rare book collection, reflected as much.
Upon graduating from the College, Houghton entered the Business School, where he reportedly received such poor grades his first year that he was forced to withdraw from the MBA program for two years. In his time off, Houghton worked for Goldman Sachs and Co.—he finally returned to Harvard to complete his MBA in 1962.
Two years later, Houghton began to work at Corning, a company founded by his great-great grandfather, and which he would later lead as chairman and CEO on two separate occasions.
Since stepping down as chairman at Corning for the second time, he has continued to play a role at the firm. He also remains a longtime trustee of the Corning Museum of Glass.

Harvard alums often go on to do great things. Take Natalie Portman '03, for example. After proving herself over the years as both a talented and diverse dramatic actress, Portman (according to Variety magazine) has just signed on to produce and star in the film adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith's wildly popular cult favorite Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.
In this adaptation of Austen's classic love story, Elizabeth Bennett will not only have to struggle with her romance with Mr. Darcy, but also battle a town full of disease-ridden killer zombies. Sounds like a blast.
Ardent fans of the novel claim that a lesser known actress should have been cast as the heroine, but many think that Portman will shine in a role that demands grace, wit, and sass. Horror story fanboys, eat your hearts out—before the zombies get there first. Then again, maybe Portman will come to your rescue.

Former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers said on ABC News's This Week with George Stephanopoulos that "Today, everybody agrees that the recession is over."
Wait, what? "The recession is over"?
Stephanopoulos had asked Summers, who is President Obama's top economic adviser, whether his views were in line with those of some private economists, who predict a likely increase in unemployment over the next couple of months despite the unemployment drop we experienced in November.
Summers basically said that he thinks the debate should not be about whether the economy is still in a recession (it's not), but how fast it is growing: "The question is what the pace of the expansion is going to be."
He added that this expansion happens in stages.
"First, GDP goes up. That's happened," he said. "Then hours that are worked by workers who already have jobs go up. That's starting to happen... Then unemployment starts to come down."
Summers also said that he agrees with the predictions of most professional forecasters, who say the economy will once again experience job growth by spring.
"We're in a very special kind of economic situation," he said, "and, frankly, jobs have to be the top priority."
Well, we sure hope you're right, Larry. Because some of us would love to have a job when we graduate.

If you are like Flyby and  have been desperately waiting for an update on Rivers Cuomo’s health  following his tour-bus accident, breathe a sigh of relief!
Cuomo ’99-’06, the lead  singer of Weezer, was released from a hospital in Albany, New York,  after sustaining severe injuries that included three cracked ribs, two  punctured organs (lung and spleen, respectively), and one lower leg injury (and a partridge in a pear tree.)
Last Sunday, Cuomo’s tour  bus (one of Weezer’s five tour-buses) skidded on ice and ended up  going over the guardrail and landing in a ditch, according to CNN. Cuomo was on his way from Toronto  to Boston, to perform at Boston University (What?! He wasn’t going  to play at his alma mater? That’s karma, Cuomo.)
Cuomo’s assistant also was  injured, though not seriously. His wife and daughter, who were both  on the bus, were not hurt. Cuomo, 40, spent 6 days in the hospital.
Cuomo and the band are now  on their way back home to Los Angelos, in (. . . wait for it!) a tour-bus.  Yep, flying is against the doctor’s orders.  Karl Koch, the band’s  keyboardist explained on Weezer’s  website that “the  air pressure changes would be bad for his healing punctured lung.”
Koch said that they have hired  two drivers to trade off, so the band won’t have to stop. They also  plan on taking a warmer, southerly route to avoid slippage.
And in case you were concerned,  Cuomo is getting the “cozy lower bunk for sleeping - none of that  back lounge bedroom stuff for him!” Koch said.
Koch is certain that “it  will be cool,” because he brought along seasons one and two of ‘Mad  Men,’ and “a freezer full of organic entrees.”
Looks like Cuomo’s going  to be well taken care. Good thing, because Weezer’s tour for “Raditude”  is going to resume its normal touring schedule in January.
When Cuomo first enrolled at  Harvard in 1995 he initially concentrated in Music, according to a Crimson Article announcing his return after almost  a decade. He later switched to English and American Literature and Language.  He was a resident of Cabot House.

Who would have ever thought Eliot House Dining Hall would be the stage of a dramatic Hollywood-style shootout? Well, last night Eliot Assassins wrapped up in a fashion that would've made Jason Bourne proud.
The finale pitted Alfredo E. Montelongo ’11, Julia C. Tartaglia ’11, Phoebe Kuo ’11, and William B. Peck ’12 against each other. (None of them, according to Tartaglia and Peck, had been involved in the controversial "break-in" that we told you about yesterday.) In an e-mail sent over the Eliot open list, Montelongo revealed everything that went down in this electrifying final round:
It started with Peck and his roommates waiting in the dining hall for Montelongo and Tartaglia to show up.  Little did Peck know, the couple (Peck told us they're dating) was formulating what Montelongo called a "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" style battle strategy.
Tartaglia secretly “stunned” (Assassin-speak for squirting shooting and temporarily sidelining someone who is not your assigned target) Montelongo before entering the dining hall so that his assasination of her after they entered, in front of everyone, would be nothing more than a ruse. Tartaglia would later emerge from her pseudo-death to kill Kuo and Peck, just when they least expected it. Then Tartaglia and Montelongo would shoot each other at the same time to finish off the game in a spectacular tie.
But the strategy didn't work quite as planned. According to Montelongo's e-mail, the other contestants threw a wrench into the mix. Kuo, unaware that Tartaglia was "dead," attacked her anyway. Tartaglia managed to kill Kuo (her target) but ended up stunned.  Peck (Kuo's, and now Tartaglia's, target), meanwhile, barricaded himself in the bathroom and refused to come out. “I hid so Alfredo couldn’t kill me," Peck said. "I wanted my friend, Brianne Corcoran, to keep the title of ‘Most Kills.'"
Eventually the chaos ended, and the competition resulted in a three way-tie between Peck, Tartaglia and Montelongo. Theatricals aside, Tartaglia and Peck said that they were both glad they participated in Assassins. “It was a fun ending to a stressful week and a great way to bolster House spirit,” Tartaglia said.
We at FlyBy admit that we're pretty impressed. This ending to a "just for fun" game of Assassins has left us a little breathless. Who said that the stereotype that Harvard students are intense isn't true?
