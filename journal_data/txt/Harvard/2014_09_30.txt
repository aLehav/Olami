After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Antoine Fuqua’s “The Equalizer,” three things are certain for those who terrorize the weak—death, taxes and a deliciously gruesome end courtesy of Robert McCall.
Denzel Washington plays McCall, the titular “equalizer” in this action thriller, marking the first time Washington has reunited with director Antoine Fuqua since 2001’s electrifying “Training Day,” which netted Denzel Washington an Oscar for Best Actor.
The story follows blue-collar employee McCall, a former military operative, and his vigilante struggle against a Russian crime empire. Provoked by their abuse of a teenage prostitute (Chloë Grace Moretz playing the slightly less naïve counterpart to Jodie Foster’s Iris from “Taxi Driver”), McCall begins his siege on progressively higher levels of the Russian syndicate, facing his ultimate adversary in a psychopathic mob fixer named Teddy (Marton Csokas).
We’ve seen these characters before: Robert McCall is the latest in the line of resurgent John McClane-brand heroes (à la Liam Neeson in “Taken”)—incorruptible, hyperbolically competent and undeterred by overwhelming odds. Likewise, Teddy fits the big bad mold well. He’s foreign, sadistic, and far more intelligent than any of his brainlessly arrogant underlings—smart enough to realize by the film’s climax that McCall is in a class of his own. The cookie-cutter nature of this film is exploited to mixed results. Where standout performances shine through, we can not only ignore the derivative elements but also relish in the masterful execution of familiar, traditional heroes. Other times, however, “The Equalizer” ranges from bland to outright ridiculous.
Denzel Washington, looming 60th birthday notwithstanding, plays the role of the cerebral action hero to perfection. In this film, the character of McCall is certainly “untouchable” (he cauterizes his own wounds mid-battle), but Washington makes it clear through his eyes that McCall is often personally lost despite his clear sense of justice. We learn later the reason for this—McCall’s “past life,” one that he is running away from, is the very identity that he must embrace to combat wrongdoing. This aspect of the character appears to be attracting some modest Oscar buzz for Denzel, which will almost certainly not translate to a win or even a nomination, but nonetheless serves as a testament to the range of his repertoire. Unfortunately for the bad guys of this film, McCall switches gears from conflicted detective to badass action hero without hesitation, and Washington excels in his portrayal of this respect as well. Curiously, the film’s first action scene seems to be a flagrant copy of Guy Ritchie’s “Sherlock Holmes” sequences—McCall surveys a flock of enemies in grainy slow-mo, then effortlessly dispatches them as if in a time warp. Thankfully, this gimmick is not reused later in the film, and in the major action scene of the third act, we see just how many home improvement tools McCall can use to eliminate a small army. The answer is a lot (a personal favorite was the electric drill to the back of the head).
On the side of the villains, there is less to rave about. Csokas’s Teddy is simply not as convincing or consistent as Washington, resulting in a distracting, emotionless caricature. Csokas had the charisma of a TV criminal of the week and far from enough gravitas or idiosyncrasy to match up against Washington’s McCall. What was also confusing were certain additions to the film that seemed ridiculously unnecessary. Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo, for example, drop by for less than five minutes of screen time near the movie’s end simply to reiterate the fact that McCall was once a black ops operative. David Harbour also has an ultimately cursory role as a corrupt cop. These superfluous characters, however, were not outdone by the film’s comically inappropriate end sequence, which was tacky and overzealous.
If you can overlook its decidedly clichéd aspects, however, “The Equalizer” is an entertaining film that is brilliantly gratuitous in violence and even wanders briefly into the profound thanks to the steady hand of Denzel Washington. Early in the film, we see McCall comment regarding Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea”—“You’ve gotta be who you are in this world”—and thankfully, Antoine Fuqua’s “The Equalizer” has no illusions. It is what it is, no more and no less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Proenza Schouler’s Spring 2015 collection is a remix of classic American sportswear constructed, in the brand’s usual manner, with unexpected materials. The collection is replete with trench coats in colorblocked leather and python and shirts in classic silhouettes juxtaposed with open-knit skirts and leather fringe. The collared dresses are reminiscent of schoolgirl days, with longer, ladylike hemlines that lend to the collection an air of classic sophistication, while the unusual materials give the collection a modern feel. But with the starching down of collars comes the stiffness of age and the death rattle of Proenza’s wild adolescence. With their attempt to transition into a major fashion label, creative directors Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough  seem to have lost their vision and the distinctiveness of their style.
While Proenza Schouler has been gaining recognition since its inception in 2002, the first five years of this decade have brought about major changes in its aesthetic vision. The Spring 2015 adaptations of American sportswear particularly reflect the designer’s desire to create a modern American luxury brand to rival the traditional fashion powerhouses. This approach seems to be working financially, with speculation that luxury goods conglomerate LVMH will buy a stake in the brand. Sometimes, however, it is easy to forget that Proenza Schouler, in all its sophistication and ambition, was just five years ago an emblem of unapologetic and youthful style.
Far from being an instant change, Proenza Schouler’s evolution towards less daring and unique designs has been a gradual process. Half a decade ago, Proenza was the epitome of a cool, urban girl, pastel-haired and sporting a deconstructed tie-dye dress. At the start of the decade, the brand’s output was provocative; the Spring 2010 collection featured slouchy, frayed minidresses and leather. Abrasive blues, greens, and yellows were ubiquitous, as well as prints reminiscent of tropical fish. McCollough and Hernandez’s masterful use of color resulted in a collection that was defiant, effortlessly cool, and instantly recognizable.
By the time the Spring 2012 collection rolled around, the silhouettes of their pieces had begun to change; the collection was vintage-inspired, so tailored jackets, longer hemlines. and graphic floral prints were abundant, though the color combinations of brown and yellow were reminiscent of old hotel carpets. There were still remnants of the cool girl showing through with tiger-print crop tops and slick black plastic details, but they were poorly incorporated into the vision of the collection as a whole.
Shortly thereafter, Proenza Schouler put forth a collection inspired by Tumblr andthe young users of the Internet. However, unlike previous years, this time the youthful vibe seemed contrived. The collection was certainly bold, showcasing bright colors, patchworks of mixed leathers, and photo prints. This time, though, the exuberant colors did not give Proenza the same cohesive effect as in her 2010 incarnation. The collection came off garish and artificial, seeming to be the brand’s last attempt to play up its reputation for youthfulness
Hernandez and McCollough’s later collections are more polished. They have delved into grown-up and modern aesthetics, creating impeccably made pieces but forfeiting the power of color. Fall 2013 saw boxy, clean silhouettes, beautifully tailored in crisp black and white. The collection was elegant, although lifeless in comparison to Proenza Schouler’s aesthetic of 2010. The first half of the decade has been transformative for Proenza Schouler in its transition from a visionary brand exuding youth and undeniable cool to a modern, refined, and maturing one. But in refinement and contemporary, decidedly American luxury, Proenza has decayed and has lost the appeal of its unique aesthetic vision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you download the brochure for the Public Art Walk from the Boston Art Commission website, you’ll see dozens of photographs of life-sized bronze sculptures. There’s the famed “Make Way for Ducklings” statue in the Public Garden, a statue of a grim Samuel Adams on Congress Street, a defiant Leif Erikson on Commonwealth Ave., and the Boston Women’s Memorial that has solidified the vacant stares of Abigail Adams, Lucy Stone, and Phillis Wheatley. These statues commemorate a rich history, certainly, but the works of art are cold to the touch and seem rather unapproachable.
Contrast this with the swooping, vibrant strings that compose the gigantic sculptures of Janet S. Echelman ’87 (GSD ’08) and one wonders if the two conceptions of public art even occupy the same category of aesthetic experience. Broadly, public art is any artistic creation that interacts with the urban landscape and is available to the public, regardless of socioeconomic background. So how can we reconcile these two vastly different manifestations of public art in one city?
Boston is simultaneously the home of the American Revolution and the birthplace of Facebook. It houses thousands of current or recent college students and is also the site of the first apple orchard in America.There’s an incredible amount of national history in these streets, but there’s also a growing population of young people looking for a place to settle down. This dynamic is reflected by the city’s evolving public arts scene—Boston is shedding its bronze historical statues in favor of more hip public art, bringing people together in the city in new and energetic ways.
PUBLIC CITY
For Jesse Brackenbury, executive director of downtown Boston’s Rose F. Kennedy Greenway Conservancy, public art and economic growth are tied up in the same question. “How do you get Harvard students to not go work in New York or in Silicon Valley or in Seattle,” he asks as we sit in front of Shinique Smith’s newly opened mural in Dewey Square Park. “Well, part of it is you make it feel like Boston is forward-looking and just as fun as any of those cities.”
And how does Brackenbury do that? By filling the city with exciting works of art available to the public.
Brackenbury has tinted orange sunglasses, and he’s wearing a suit for the opening of Smith’s mural “‘Seven Moon’ Junction.” The mural is a flashy display with splashes of bright yellow paint, swooping swaths of black, and painted friendship bracelet braids drooping across the facade. An Ethiopian pop band is playing, children are running across the green space without shoes, classes of students are filing past a food truck. This is what Brackenbury envisioned for the Greenway Conservancy.
“Part of what will keep all of the people graduating from all of the colleges here staying here is feeling like there is real energy, real vibrancy, real new ideas, real innovation,” Brackenbury says. “And public art—particularly contemporary public art—can play a real role in making this a vibrant 21st century city.”
It seems that city administrators support this view as well. Last week Mayor Marty Walsh appointed a chief of arts and culture, Julie Burros. According to a press release from the Mayor’s Office, Burros will oversee the members of the Boston Art Commission and the Boston Cultural Council, as well as their $1.3 million annual budget. The administration filled this “Arts Czar” position after it had been vacant for more than 20 years, and Walsh has stated that he wants to integrate art and culture into the lives of Boston residents.
But what does that mean? How can we integrate “culture” into our everyday lives if it is an inherent part of our existence already?
Brackenbury sits back in his red plastic Adirondack chair and tries to summarize Boston’s motivation for increasing public art. “There’s a fun element to it, there’s a draw-people-to-the-park element to it, but if you’re thinking about it as the mayor or the next governor, there’s also a competitiveness element.”
Boston has the potential to become another attractive, young city by creating artistic installations that bring people out of their buildings and into shared space. Think about the huge orange gates in New York City’s Central Park or the oddly attractive Cloud Gate, that huge metallic bean in Chicago’s Millenium Park. These works of art, even though the Central Park installation was temporary, became recognizable nationwide, and demonstrated the ability of public art to bring people into shared spaces. Though the Walsh administration’s push to increase art in the city started earlier this year, there are public art projects already years underway in parts of Boston. This suggests that the Walsh administration might be riding a public art wave rather than creating the ripple on its own.
BY THE SEA
There is a rising tide of artwork on Boston’s shoreline: the HarborArts Shipyard Gallery has been attracting local artists to make sea-inspired creations for more than four years. If you’ve ever wandered down to the aquarium or taken a ferry to any of Boston’s islands, you may have seen the enormous orange cod that sits atop a warehouse in Boston’s old and still functional shipyard. This 40-foot fish is the center of HarborArts, Boston’s largest collection of contemporary outdoor public art and the only permanent gallery of outdoor art in the city. Steve Israel, creator of the sculpture, says he wanted to use his piece to engage the public in a conversation about water resources and the importance of preserving the marine ecosystem. Now, though, the space holds much more than the orange behemoth.
“Our original mission was heavily focused on...educating people on water resource issues, but that has grown to a broader mission of really transforming an industrial space into a place to experience art,“ HarborArts executive director Matt Pollock says in a phone interview.
One of HarborArts’s newest pieces is much closer to the ground than this lofty cod, but it also reminds visitors about Boston’s relationship with the sea. HarborArts is calling the piece the world’s largest tattoo: Somerville artist Liz LaManche created enormous inked designs that cover the cement dock, as if the shipyard itself were a sailor’s forearm.
“Each tattoo represents a different culture that we’ve been connected to by sea in our sailing history of the past 200 years,” Pollock says of the artwork, which was completed two weeks ago. The Wampanoag, Mohegan, and Pequot—Native American tribes with roots in New England—are represented by a woven geometric pattern; another grid-like, dotted pattern is meant to represent West African BaKongo tattoo design, and Ireland is symbolized on the tattoo dock by a Celtic knot. LaManche has been working with artists who have knowledge of these culture and worked one-on-one with them to design the different tattoos.
Because many of the works of art use found materials—bits of metal collected on the shipyard or other recycled pieces—or riff off industrial designs, it’s often hard to tell what is art and what is just part of the crazy industrial landscape of a working dockyard, Pollock says. This could be one unintended consequence of making art widely accessible to the public—a person could totally ignore the work, or perhaps acknowledge its presence but not have time to stop and ask questions. There is always the danger of an artist’s work being disregarded or interpreted as part of the functional environment of a city rather than an intentional, aesthetic creation.
In Pollock’s opinion, though, the fluidity of interaction between viewer and art is something that adds meaning and excitement to the pieces themselves. “When you’re in [an indoor] gallery I think people automatically are searching for the meaning, but when you’re in the public you have more freedom to engage with the artwork however it naturally comes to you.”
ART HISTORY
Public art doesn’t ask to be let in, but it has the potential of enhancing the way its audience interacts with not only the piece of art, but also the space that it occupies. Like the giant cod atop the shipyard warehouse, other big public artworks can enrich the context and history of the places in which they are displayed.
This is true of public artworks on Harvard’s campus as well. How many historic buildings, plaques, and statues do we walk past just on the commute from dorm to lecture hall, and how many of those artifacts or memorials do we really understand? Maybe you had an Ec10 lecture in Sanders and ran through the vestibule in Memorial Hall, sprinting and slipping across the floor on your way from breakfast to class. You may or may not know that the building is an actual memorial—that the names on the walls are those of Harvard students who died fighting for the Union during the Civil War. You also may or may not know that there are no names of students who gave their lives fighting for the Confederacy.
Artist Brian Knep wanted to draw attention to the building’s silenced history with his interactive artwork “Deep Wounds,” which first appeared in Memorial Hall in April 2006 and will be reinstalled in April 2015. The work consists of large squares projected onto the floor of the hall which at first appear to be blank. When the viewer walks over the patches of light, computers register the change in movement and disturb the surface of the projection—the white light parts like a flesh wound to reveal death dates and locations of Harvard students who died fighting for the Confederacy. Their names cannot appear anywhere in the hall, according to the original building plans, so their identities are instead communicated by relationship labels such as “Father,” “Classmate,” and “Brother.”
Teil Silverstein, project director at the Office of Fine Arts Public Art Program, notes that Knep wanted to address themes of reconciliation and healing by depicting a blistering organic process on the floor of the historic building. “This really…made a lot of people aware of the fact that Memorial Hall…is about a war and a conflict and the people who were in that conflict and gave their lives for it,” Silverstein says in a phone interview.
She goes on to describe past works of art that the OFA has commissioned; one that gained particular recognition was on display during the Arts First festival in 2012, David Michalek’s “Slow Dancing.” Projected onto the front of Widener Library, huge images of people dancing in slow motion made many passersby stop in their tracks and engage with the façade of an intimidating building that most students take for granted as a part of the academic landscape. Silverstein mentions that the artwork intended to draw attention to the library as a space of contemplation.
“Public art is about a dialogue with the site, with the community,” Silverstein says. Large works of art like Michalek’s and Knep’s are meant to be educational, both for Harvard affiliates and for the wider community of people who might walk through the campus.
“Because the works are at Harvard, usually the dialogue—to the extent that it is about the space—it’s often about something that’s Harvard-related,” Silverstein says. “We are at an educational institution. We definitely want to give people the opportunity at Harvard to interact with the work…. And we definitely want to give artists this opportunity to be in a laboratory.”
ARTISTIC TIES
Walking into Janet Echelman’s studio in Brookline feels a bit like walking into a laboratory; there are technical drawings tacked to the walls, complicated string sculptures strung from the ceiling, and a handful of workers typing into computer modeling software. There’s an incredible energy in the room as Echelman describes her past pieces, most of them large, whimsical structures that take up whole patches of sky.
There is one sculpture that was modeled after graphic data collected from the 2010 Chilean earthquake and resulting tsunami that shortened the day by 1.26 microseconds. That length of time became the title of this piece, and its colorful, billowing form has been displayed in Amsterdam, Sydney, and Singapore. The collapsable, relatively light structure of the sculpture makes it very mobile; it can be literally woven into a city—tethered to the earth by ties to buildings alone.
Echelman speaks enthusiastically about this piece’s versatility and mentions her plans to create a new sculpture for Boston that is equally integrated with the cityscape.
“I am intrigued to enter into a conversation about the decisions that have shaped this city at different times,” Echelman says about Boston. The sculpture is similar in shape to the highway that once passed directly through the heart of Boston—Interstate 93, also called the Central Artery. Echelman will string the sculpture over the Greenway, which is also the former location of Interstate 93 before the “Big Dig” buried that highway underneath the city.
“My goal is to embrace and recall the history of this place as an example of what we have done in cities since the Second World War, where we gave the automobile higher priority than the dwellers of the city,” Echelman says. "My art begins with a ghost image of the old elevated highway and transforms into stitching this city back together again. It’s calling attention to the transformation that’s ongoing."
These large works of public art—whether on the side of a building in the Rose Kennedy Greenway, atop a warehouse in the shipyard, or inside Memorial Hall—allow viewers to understand not just the piece of art itself but also its environment in a new way.
Echelman’s sculpture is set to open in May 2015 and will be installed above the Greenway until October. Not only will the buildings around Dewey Square be connected by colorful, sturdy string, but Echelman also points out that the installation of the piece will require collaboration between building managers and city planners. In a sense, the sculpture has already encouraged interaction between Bostonians.
That is just what Brackenbury hopes will occur in the Greenway—more people interacting in the public space, enjoying the park, creating an exciting city atmosphere and discussing art with their necks craned skyward.
As for Echelman? “My work doesn’t give an answer or tell you what to think—it begins a conversation,” she says with a smile. “It’s an ambitious goal to literally lace the city of Boston back together with its waterfront.”

Imagine a particularly sharp and engrossing New Yorker comic staring at you from between your fingers as you sip your coffee, and you might just experience the essence of Jessica Brandl’s award-winning ceramic works. Though delicately molded and painted, the crockery of the Harvard Ceramic Program’s 2014-2015 Artist in Residence is not your grandmother’s Limoges teacup set: ranging from coffee mugs to Thanksgiving turkey plates, the pieces boast compelling scenes set in the artist’s Midwest childhood home that poke, prod, and unsettle the viewer with their piquant historical allusions, terse humor, and sharp social commentaries. The genius of Brandl’s work, however, lies in its ability to convey the artist’s message in both its pragmatic physicality as a quotidian eating utensil and in the transcendent images it offers.
The plate most emblematic of Brandl’s style is “Manifest,” a small terra cotta charger coated in a white slip and vibrant underglazes. At first glance, the plate’s circular depression presents a television sitting in a cavernous, dilapidated room. If observed more closely however, the room’s peeling blue walls and decaying, patchy white ceiling become a dramatic horizon of sky and cloud—the sarcastically sublime backdrop for the covered wagons, farmers’ plows, and Native American travois of John Ghast’s 1872 painting “American Progress.”  Brandl’s reframing of this classic illustration of manifest destiny in the confines of a decaying room is as unsettling as it is mesmerizing: the sheer technical prowess of fitting the illusion of infinite space into a room and then onto a 20-inch circular surface is breathtaking in and of itself. Just as engaging, however, is the gnawing question the work presents: what is the legacy of America’s spirit of expansion today?
But this only describes the most obvious facet of the piece. The rest is awarded to only the most curious of viewers, as it can only be discovered through a physical exploration of the piece. A slight lifting of the plate and peek into the hollow underneath reveals a whole other painted subject: the familiar image of the American bald eagle sprawled in full flight, carrying a banner that reads not the usual “E Pluribus Unum” but “Too dear for my possessing.” This lyrical fragment of a Shakespearean sonnet suggests a subtle solution to the question raised by the front of the plate: restraint. Some things are most beautiful left untouched. (The biggest irony would be, of course, the owner of the plate, who by tranquilly digging into a juicy steak might bring to the piece a more tangible dimension of American consumerism.)
Brandl’s concern for physical and moral decay is ultimately a personal one. Both of her parents are Nebraskans, but she spent the better part of her childhood in Texas, where her father became a successful businessman in the booming technology market. As her family moved to Nebraska in the 70s, however, Brandl found herself in the midst of a totally alien world. Neighbors were few and far between. Many of the houses around her had been abandoned. As a bored teenager, she would often vault through the windows and explore the vacant spaces. “It made me wonder, why is it that Texas is new and growing and Nebraska so empty and in decline?” she says. For Brandl, art became a way to make sense of the world she came from and record her personal experience of it. Part of her transformation included seeing the beauty in the decline around her. “There is something so precious in decaying layers of wallpaper—from the different layers that become exposed, you can read through time.” The derelict buildings that had initially alienated her became powerful recurrent subjects in her works. Besides “Manifest,” they include “Sinking Ship,” inspired by an abandoned chapel Brandl passed on the highway in Nebraska earlier this year. The piece consists of a large terra cotta plate on which is painted a lifeboat paddling away from a Titanic-like church assailed by ferocious waves. The scene becomes all the more poignant as one reads the words “God is with us” on the side of the listing church.
As multilayered as some pieces are, others prove that Brandl has also mastered the fine art of simplicity. In their small paintable surfaces, her mugs are the best canvases for wit and whimsical designs. One such mug features the word “mobile” scrawled on it, bearing a trailer on one side and a covered wagon on the other. Another has the word “nice” above an elegantly-groomed donkey. One of her most bestselling mugs, however, is “shit!”, which features a graveyard painted with playful strokes on one side and an open coffin on the other. What better reminder is there to go ahead and enjoy that daily morning coffee?

At 9:30 a.m., when most students are struggling to get out of bed, Kaledora F. Kiernan-Linn ’18 is already starting her pliés in company class.
As a dancer in Boston Ballet II, Kiernan-Linn is in the studio weekdays from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.—a schedule that will only become more hectic as Boston Ballet begins its performances at the end of October. She will be performing in her first company role in the corps de ballet of “Swan Lake” this October.
A New York City native, Kiernan-Linn (who goes by the stage name of Kaledora Fontana, using her middle name rather than her last) started taking ballet lessons at a young age, “like everyone does in New York,” Kiernan-Linn says. After moving to San Francisco at the age of five, she stopped taking lessons. “It wasn’t really a big thing in my life yet,” Kiernan-Linn recalls. However, the following year, she began to train with the San Francisco Ballet School. “I knew I liked it immediately—that’s when ballet really started for me,” she says.
“Some of my earliest memories of ballet are of facing the barre and working on positions and trying to perfect something,” Kiernan-Linn recalls. “I didn’t care that I wasn’t on the music….I would always be the person who stays after to ask questions about different moves and combinations.”
At the age of 11, Kiernan-Linn and her family decided to settle down back in New York City. “Dance was a big factor in my life at that point,” Kiernan-Linn recounts. “I probably knew when I was eight that I wanted to be a dancer. But it wasn’t weird to me, and I didn’t think it made me special or something. I just took it for granted that some people want to do other things but that I wanted to be a dancer.” Though they were not moving for another year, Kiernan-Linn decided to try out for the prestigious School of American Ballet (SAB) to see if she could make the cut. She did.
When it came time to apply to colleges, Kiernan-Linn focused on Columbia, but her mother suggested she apply to Harvard for fun. “I never even imagined I would get in,” Kiernan-Linn remembers. After acceptances to Columbia, Stanford, and Harvard came in, she toured Columbia and Harvard, ultimately deciding that Harvard’s flexibility trumped Columbia’s location. She accepted her spot at Harvard and deferred for a year to finish her ballet training and look for a contract with a ballet company.
The following year, Kiernan-Linn signed a contract with Boston Ballet. “I came out [of the audition], and [Artistic Director] Mikko [Nissinen] said, ‘You have the job!’ And we were all screaming and crying with happiness,” Kiernan-Linn says.  “My mom said, ‘Ask about Harvard—it’s now or never!’ And so I went over and asked him, and he was very understanding and said ‘yes’ immediately.”
In order to be able to both dance for Boston Ballet and attend classes at Harvard, Kiernan-Linn had to pick her schedule very carefully. She currently misses rehearsals on Mondays and Wednesdays to take classes and attend sections 1-5 p.m. She also takes a freshman seminar on Tuesdays, 4-6 p.m., for which she must also miss rehearsals, and a fourth class for which she cannot attend lectures in person but must watch them online by herself.
Kiernan-Linn is the first to admit the intensity of her scheduling, which leaves her little time to finish her coursework, let alone sleep.“It’s hectic, but I could never imagine myself giving up dance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Perhaps most famous for his 1973 horror film “The Exorcist,” Academy Award-winning director William Friedkin has been pushing the boundaries of mainstream filmmaking for nearly 50 years. Friedkin was on campus to present Houghton Library with the original manuscripts for his recent memoir, “The Friedkin Connection.” The Crimson had a chance to catch up with him on Sep. 27 before the screening of his 2011 film “Killer Joe.”
The Harvard Crimson: Last night at the [Harvard Film] Archive, your film “Sorcerer” was screened, a movie which unfortunately is remembered as a financial flop. How did your experience with that failure change the way you approach film?
William Friedkin: It didn’t at all. I’ve kept the same goals, desires, ambitions, and type of film that I love that I started out with. It hasn’t changed my approach at all. Now, the films that are made today have changed radically from the kind of films we made in the ’70s and before, and a little bit after. The films have changed, but I haven’t changed. I haven’t changed since high school. I’m the same guy that I was in high school. I find the same things funny, the same things tragic, the same things interesting.
THC: When you’re making a film, do you have to think about the financial outcome?
WF: No. You have to think about the budget going in. And, I don’t make big blockbuster films. You know, I don’t make films that cost more than $5 to 7 million, but that’s what I’m interested in—character and story, not computer-generated spectacle.
THC: Last year, your memoir [“The Friedkin Connection”] came out. How was…writing a book, especially a very personal book, [different] from directing a film?
WF: It’s not dissimilar; you’re telling a story, with words on a page, or film, or a digital camera. I wrote the book in longhand, and I make films in longhand too; they’re handmade. I didn’t have an outline, as I would have for a film. I just sat down every day and wrote what came to mind in a Moleskine book. I filled 13 Moleskine books. When I’d get about 50 pages handwritten, I’d record them in a micro-cassette recorder and have them typed. And they’d come back as about 30 pages, and I’d correct those pages eight or nine times and I’d send those pages to my editor…and she’d make comments, and we’d have a little back and forth until I got the whole thing together…. But I started in longhand, and that’s what I’ve given the Houghton Library, the longhand books.
THC: When you say your films are handmade, do you mean that symbolically?
WF: No, I mean they’re all very personal. I choose every shot. I choose every actor. I choose the entire crew. I don’t just come in and do a piece of work. I’ve only done about 15 films, I’ve done some television, but I think in over 50 years I’ve done about 15 films. I’ve abandoned a lot of things, but for the most part, with the exception of when I first started, I’ve done stuff I wanted to do, right or wrong.
THC: [Your film] “Killer Joe” is showing tonight—can you say anything about your decision to keep its most graphic scenes, even though the film was going to be given an NC-17 rating?
WF: I made the film I wanted to make, and the ratings board is a censorship board. They used to be a ratings board; they were created for the sole purpose of advising parents about the material in a film so that parents could decide whether the material was appropriate for their young children. That was their original purpose. Now they’re a censorship board, and they wanted to censor the crap out of “Killer Joe.” The phrase I’ll use when I introduce the film is that they wanted me to destroy it in order to save it, which is what the generals used to say in Vietnam. We had to destroy it in order to save it, and I wasn’t prepared to do that. So I took the most extreme and severe rating, which limited the audience, of course.
THC: Do you feel the environment of filmmaking—the MPAA and everything else—do you think it’s gotten worse since the beginning of your career?
WF: Well, it’s changed. It’s changed in a way that I don’t think I could flourish as I did in the ’70s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Good People,” Britain’s most boring couple finds some illegal drug money and then gets hunted down by the stereotypical “bad guys” because that’s what happens in every action movie. Kate Hudson and James Franco star as Anna and Tom Reed in Henrik Ruben Genz’s thriller-by-name-only. After Ben, the tenant living in their basement, dies of a drug overdose, the couple discovers £220,000 he stole from his equally corrupt friends. Like any daring and slightly stupid action movie couple oblivious to the consequences of their decisions, they take the money to pay off their debts. Of course, bad guys with guns come after them. Lines then blur between good and bad people—an overdone and obvious message—in a movie replete with wearisome characters, a plot severely lacking in originality, and an overall cinematic effect of failed suspense.
“Good People” is quite deficient in the creativity and integrity of its dialogue, making the characters uninspired and predictable and allowing for no character development. The relationship between Anna and Tom seems painfully tedious, as they deliver cliché lines without a hint of excitement. There is not one moment throughout the film in which they exhibit the lively chemistry of a young married couple, but rather are frustratingly affected the whole time. The lackluster couple seems only a device to set the plot in motion so the viewer can see the more exciting scenes of violence later on.
It is difficult for a movie to have an enthralling and believable plot if it is set in motion by a stupid action, and “Good People” is no exception. The storyline is so overdone that it is entirely predictable from start to finish—not a good start for a movie based upon the idea of suspense. The beginning of the movie seems to drag on forever, as it contains the labored dialogue between Tom and Anna and the obvious introductory parts the viewer could already have predicted. However, some scenes of the film are so totally improbable they would have been humorous if the movie had not succeeded in already putting its viewers to sleep. The final scene culminates in a murder by nail gun, a woman and a baby jumping out of a window, and a house burning down, of course, for dramatic effect.
The cinematography also does nothing for the suspense. Many of the shots, even at the climax of the film as the Reeds face off the criminals, were filmed from too far away and showed too much of the scene to leave the viewer guessing about what would happen next. Though the score was certainly ominous, it was also monotonous and repetitive, which, mixed with the long shots, made the scenes just tiresome. However, certain surprisingly interesting visual techniques surface occasionally throughout the film, slightly redeeming its dismal position. One of the beginning scenes of the movie features a close-up shot of a windshield upon which a sudden splatter of blood appears with the sound of a gunshot. The view through the windshield changes as the car begins to veer to the left, windshield wipers frantically smearing the blood. From this high-intensity shot, however, the movie goes drastically downhill. Nonetheless, the entire film is bathed in a dark greenish glow, which is effective in making the mood more ominous. Occasionally, there are some shots filmed totally upside down, which add visual interest and variety to the movie. These unexpected elements, however, are largely unable to compensate for the film’s overarching lack of flavor.
“Good People” is mind-numbingly boring—it follows perfectly the template for a standard action movie, with stereotypical and uninspired characters and an unoriginal and painfully easy-to-predict plot. The film fails to do well even what most thrillers do: create a suspenseful yet unintellectual storyline.

Simon Pegg goes soul-searching around the world in Peter Chelsom’s “Hector and the Search for Happiness.” The result is a film that veers once or twice into mawkishness but is ultimately successful at being what it set out to be—a witty comedy with formidable doses of both humor and heart.
Hector (Pegg) is a man who lives a self-described “satisfactory life”—he has a long-term live-in girlfriend, a set of middle-class daily routines, and a stable psychiatric practice. Thrown into a crisis that is ostensibly career-related, he embarks on a “research” journey to find out what true happiness is. Hector’s adventure takes him to China, Africa, and beyond, where he meets a truly eclectic line-up of characters who each have their own additions to the recipe for happiness. He is treated to paid escort in Shanghai, wired to a machine seemingly inspired by Cerebro from the X-Men, and imprisoned in a warlord’s jail cell before finally returning home.
The events that unfold in between piece together the puzzle of happiness, relayed in a quirky and colorful cinematographic style which alternates between standard photography and a comic strip. The cartoon motif adds an air of otherworldly fantasy to the entire story—a very nice stylistic touch that gives “Hector” a Paulo Coelho feel.
Simon Pegg is so grounded and believable as the confused but curious Hector that one wonders why it took so long for him to make a film like this. Eccentric but relatable, Pegg stabilizes the film as it makes stops throughout the entire dramatic spectrum, from penis jokes to real moments of sensitivity and pathos. Despite being without usual sidekick Nick Frost, with whom he has made his most successful films, Pegg alternates between the straight man and the funny man with ease.
Pegg is also supported by a versatile array of performers filling the roles of characters that Hector meets throughout his journey—Stellan Skarsgard plays a materialistic businessman, Jean Reno plays a volatile drug dealer, and Christopher Plummer is an overenthusiastic university lecturer. Toni Collette and Rosamund Pike also headline competently with Pegg as Hector’s ex-girlfriend and current girlfriend, respectively. These characters range from the very familiar to outright caricatures, but there is a sense that this simplicity is not only acceptable but necessary. After all, regardless of how solid the performances are, each character serves only to guide Hector in his pursuit of happiness.
In a film that centers on a single philosophical question, the success of the movie certainly hinges, at least in part, on how well the film answers the question at hand. In this respect “Hector” does a surprisingly good job. Naturally, there is a degree of vacillation, but at its best, “Hector” ventures into the inspired. During the darkest moment of the film, when Hector is held at the gunpoint of a psychotic warlord, he is forced to confront the fact that he is travelling not to better treat his patients’ needs for happiness but his own. The film’s third act is quite forced at times, but fortunately, the ending is satisfying and true. While Hector left on a journey expecting to be enlightened or transformed, all that he learned and needed to learn was how meaningful his life already was.
“Hector” does not offer a ground-breaking new doctrine for happiness. What it does do, however, is lead us through a worthwhile journey that we’ve gone on many times—and wouldn’t mind going on again. “Hector” is about a man who never dared to live and, in a span of weeks, learns to see all the hues of life that he had been missing—the laughs, the tears, and everything crazy and spectacular in between.

Renewable energy is all the rage at the moment. Fears of global warming are ever present (and well-justified, I might add). Tax benefits for solar panels and wind turbines are at an all-time high. On Harvard’s campus, chants and rallies for divestment urge a shift away from fossil fuels toward renewables.
With Denmark’s wind power production exceeding its consumption on certain days last year, there have been calls for the United States to go completely fossil-free and become solely renewable-powered by 2050. After all, if Denmark can do it, why can’t we?
This is the point where I want to grab these 100-percent-renewable-promoting people and scream, “That’s not how it works! That’s not how any of this works!” (Oh, and Denmark isn’t entirely wind powered, that’s a misunderstanding—the true number is around 40 percent of electricity generation.)
Regardless of political pressure (which many have blamed for our lack of renewables), having a fully renewable-powered United States is physically impossible—and you can blame the sorry state of the U.S. energy grid.
Very few people know how the electricity is transmitted from, say, a wind turbine to their light bulb. We are lucky to live in a developed country where electricity can be taken for granted and blackouts are extraordinarily rare. This makes the electric grid appear to be a stable, ever-present figure that quietly and efficiently powers the country. In reality, the electric grid is less a perfectly fine-tuned blanket of distribution and more an ever-evolving patchwork quilt of relatively inefficient power lines.
There are two massive problems that currently plague the electric grid: We can’t store the electricity we produce, and we can’t transmit the electricity far from where it was generated.
There have been times when, in the Midwest on particularly windy days, there is so much energy generated by massive wind farms that there isn’t enough demand in the local area to use up all the electricity. When that happens, it would be fantastic if we could just put aside the excess electricity for another time when we need it. But we can’t. In fact, because there is absolutely no way to efficiently store this excess energy, the wind farm owners must sometimes pay money to offload their electricity.
Not being able to store it wouldn’t be an issue if we could just send all the excess electricity somewhere else though. After all, even if Wyoming’s five residents don’t need the energy at that moment, New York City is always hungry for more electricity. So what would happen if Wyoming’s wind farms generated the only energy available in the country, Wyoming had excess electricity, and a man in the Big Apple turned on his lights in an attempt to increase demand?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The light wouldn’t even go on. Due to the structure of our power grid, electricity cannot travel from Wyoming to New York.
In fact, the electric grid in the United States is actually three electric “interconnections”—the Western Interconnection, the Eastern Interconnection, and the Electrical Reliability Council of Texas. Electricity is hardly transferred between the interconnections—not out of choice, mind you. We physically cannot due to the difference between grid structures and a lack of infrastructure. And even within an interconnection, electricity struggles to travel distances of greater than 400 miles.
Now we return to the feasibility of a 100 percent renewable energy United States.
It’s true that if we covered just five percent of Arizona with solar photovoltaic panels, we would have more than enough energy to cover the four trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity consumed annually in the United States. However, if we actually built this massive solar farm, the consequence wouldn’t be a green United States. It would just mean that the Southwest would have massively negative energy prices (assuming the grid in the area could even handle the load) while the rest of the United States would be in a perpetual blackout. No storage, and no long-distance or cross-interconnection transmission, remember? And what happens if it gets cloudy?
Wind power suffers from the same problems—even worse, actually, since wind is less predictable than the sun.
We’ve tapped all the hydropower sources in the country and it only accounts for seven percent of our nation’s electricity production.
Geothermal sites are unlikely to have a production capacity of more than 20 percent of total U.S. consumption (and are currently sitting at 0.41 percent).
Despite the environmental benefits, the fact simply remains that renewable energy—wind and solar in particular—is simply too volatile from minute to minute to produce the steady power we need. And we don’t yet have the storage or transmission technology to address these issues.
Sadly, for the time being, we will simply have to accept that the vast majority of our electricity must come from fossil fuel and nuclear plants.
Sorry, Earth.

For over 100 years, the Administrative Board has been a stable, if at times ominous, institution on campus. Beginning next academic year, the Ad Board will implement the largest structural changes in its history, changes that will alter both the types of cases and the number of cases the Board will deliberate on in the future.
For many students, the Ad Board has largely been shrouded in mystery. But the infamous Government 1310 cheating debacle and the federal government's recent investigations into the handling of sexual assault cases have highlighted a need to alter the responsibilities of the disciplinary body. When the honor code is implemented and a student-faculty body begins hearing cases of academic dishonesty, the Ad Board will no longer examine the vast majority of cases dealing with cheating. And with the recent creation of the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, the Board will also no longer be primarily responsible for investigating cases of sexual violence. Instead, the Ad Board will focus its attention on cases related to student abuses of drugs and alcohol and administrative procedures like student petitions to simultaneously enroll in classes.
This separation of disciplinary powers will certainly benefit students.
The presence of a body perhaps imbued with extraordinary disciplinary powers but with scant information about its procedures available to undergraduates was harmful for the reputation of the university. Students need to feel that disciplinary action exists to give an incentive for good behavior, not to instill fear that a minor transgression will destroy their academic careers or that even if they offer honest defenses of their actions that their words will fall on deaf ears. Hopefully the honor code and the soon-to-be-developed honor board will help develop a culture among students to take cases of academic dishonesty very seriously. This is an issue of student culture, but the change in the composition of the Ad Board is an excellent first step in the right direction.
The slimming down of the Ad Board's jurisdiction is also helpful for students because the new disciplinary bodies will have more specific tasks. It is embarrassing that Harvard continues to suffer from a plague of sexual assault and sexual harassment cases, and further that endemic issues within administrative bodies have led to several cases in which assaulters are forgiven and victims are left feeling unsafe on campus. The creation of an independent body composed partially of experts in interpreting cases of sexual violence and focused on assembling all the facts in these cases ensures that these tragedies will be top priorities, handled properly.
It remains to be seen how the honor board and ODR will affect the Ad Board itself in practice. But for now, it is heartening to see the Ad Board and its spin-offs promising a more constructive collective role.

Your article about the Student Labor Action Movement’s calls for Harvard University to cut ties with Teach For America (“Student Activist Group Calls on Faust To Sever Ties with TFA,” Sept. 28, 2014) unfortunately missed an opportunity to present the perspectives who were criticized—the countless TFA alumni now pursuing graduate degrees here at Harvard.
If SLAM members are concerned that TFA alumni only “want to teach for a few years and then go to law school or business school” to pursue lucrative careers in other fields, let me assure them otherwise. I am fortunate to count many TFA alumni among my classmates at Harvard Law School, and I continue to be struck by how they are using their time here to acquire the skills and competencies necessary to fight the opportunity gap and economic inequality more broadly.
No, they are not leading a classroom anymore. But they are spending their summers in unpaid internships with organizations like the Education Law Center and NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund. They log hours in the Education Law Clinic here at Harvard, advocating for individual students touched by trauma to be given the tools they need to succeed in school.
They cross-register for classes at the Graduate School of Education and at Kennedy School that focus on education law and policy. They volunteer in local classrooms and meaningfully engage in communities like those they taught in through a whole host of student organizations and clinics.
My peers may have left their classrooms, but they have not left their students and their communities behind. Many of them—myself included—have come to law school in order to figure out how to better serve our students and their communities.
I do not disagree with some of the points made by SLAM. I do, however, urge its members to consider that having some TFA alumni move on to graduate school after time in the classroom is not a flaw of the organization.

I am a member of a dying breed in America. No, not Republicans under the age of thirty, or straight men who care about how they dress (though both are applicable). I am speaking instead of the proud tradition of mainline Protestantism. In the 1950s, the “mainline” denominations included a majority of Americans; their market share has declined precipitously since the 1960s to their current 15 percent of the adult population. This might be shocking to some, since in the last half century it seems that Christians’ voices have grown louder in the national conversation. Again, probably true, but that increase in volume has not come from my compatriots in the United Methodist Church. The rise in Christian activism in American politics in the late 1970s is instead correlated with a rise in the prevalence of evangelical and fundamentalist denominations.
While both groups are Christian, there are critical differences between evangelical and mainline Protestants, which are well-reflected in an informative 2009 survey by The Barna Group. The mainline churches are disproportionately old in comparison to the national population and face difficulties attracting young adults. They also lack significant representation from minority groups, especially Hispanics. (Remind anyone of a certain political party?) Perhaps most significantly, only 31 percent of mainline Protestants “believe they have a personal responsibility to discuss their faith with people who have different beliefs.”
Now, there are both good and bad things about that emotional reticence. One neglects a Christian duty when one avoids these conversations—my religion tells me I have an obligation to share the Word. Yet one is also more likely to make and keep friends outside the faith. When it comes to being an American—a full and active participant in the oldest continually functioning liberal democracy in the world—I do think that there is a right approach. I may not always know the best way to convey my Christian beliefs to my non-Christian friends, but I am positive that actively working to enshrine those beliefs in federal law is a bad idea.
The First Amendment guarantees both freedom of speech and freedom of religion, and as a classical liberal I am skeptical of attempts to infringe those rights. In recent years, the left has tried this in the name of “tolerance” and “pluralism.” But the right has advanced particular social policies in a way that feels like a Crusade, with a capital C.
There are plenty of Christian ideas, such as the beneficial social effects of a child being raised by two loving parents, that are backed up by statistical data. There are others, however, that only make coherent sense if you ascribe to a Christian worldview. If one does not see value in maintaining the purity of the human body as a temple of the Holy Spirit (or even rejects the ideas of “purity” or “spirit” as a whole), then it is difficult to justify the criminalization of marijuana or the dangers of premarital sex. We are simply arguing from different planes of understanding, and while acceptable in private conversations among friends, it becomes increasingly dangerous when it morphs into a “my rights versus yours” kind of argument.
Too many American Christians believe that their two identities—“American” and “Christian”—are synonymous. While the two groups might share a few ideals, they are surely not the same, and I cringe at the thought of political parties based solely on religion and nationality. I encourage American Christians to continue to be vocal about their faith, while also comprehending that a large number of Americans are not Christian and that theocracy is evangelism done wrong. Try making a new friend instead of passing a new law; I guarantee that you will get further that way. As for myself, how do I reconcile all of these labels–Christian, Republican, American–in my own life? Well, as a Christian I invite you to join me for Bible study on Thursday afternoons with Harvard College Faith and Action. As a Republican, I similarly extend an invitation to our meetings on the first Tuesday night of every month in Adams House. And as an American? To quote the great cultural icon Rhett Butler, “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn.”

“It’s not about religion, it’s about humanity,” read a poster held up by a student at the Science Center Plaza Monday. The student was one of fifteen or so participants in Monday’s “dead-in,” an event hosted by the Palestine Solidarity Committee to raise awareness of the roughly 2,100 people who were killed in Gaza this summer.
Members of the PSC encircled Halah Y. Ahmad ’17, as she read the names and ages of the men, women and children who died in Israeli-Palestinian crossfire. As Ahmad continued to read the names, a few participants assumed “dead” positions on the ground.
“Two thousand one hundred people were killed in Gaza this summer. Today, we remember their names and their broken families,” Ahmad said, as onlookers took pictures of the students and their posters. Ahmad repeated these sentences several times throughout the event.
At several points during the reading, names of individuals from the same family were read. As their names were spoken, more PSC members dropped to the ground. Some Gaza victims were toddlers, Committee members said, while others were close to eighty years old.
Aside from small shifts of their feet and hands, the students lay still on the plaza. When bottles of water were placed by their feet, no one took a sip.
“I was very moved by the fact that it was peaceful, civil and informative,” said Director of the Harvard Foundation S. Allen Counter, who looked on.
PSC leaders said they planned the event to promote open conversation about the people who were killed throughout the summer. Members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance and Student Labor Action Movement also participated in the “dead-in.”
“Throughout the summer, there was solidarity throughout the world,” PSC co-Chair Fatima M. Bishtawi ’17 said. “We didn’t want to lose that momentum.”
After more than an hour of reading, a student with an “I stand with Gaza” poster was the only one left standing while Ahmad continued to read names through her megaphone. On the sign’s white background was an image of a dove clutching an olive branch.
“It was very moving to hear the names read thoughtfully one by one,” Professor of Comparative Religion and Lowell House Co-Master Diana L. Eck said. “It was a very important event, and I was happy to be here for each and every name.”

UPDATED: September 30, 2014, at 1:00 a.m.
The Food Better campaign kicked off with a presentation at the Harvard Community Garden on Monday, one in a week-long series of events designed to improve student awareness on all issues related to food.
The partnership between Harvard University Dining Services, the Harvard Office for Sustainability, and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic is part of a push by the broader Harvard community to increase and consolidate discussion on food and diet.
“Food is something that is personal, it’s something everybody can relate to, but there are a lot of issues around how food is produced and what happens to food once it’s used,” said Colin B. Durrant, manager of sustainability communications at the Office for Sustainability.
The main goal of Food Better is to facilitate conversations amongst students to help them better understand the issues and opportunities surrounding food literacy, from food sustainability and food systems to reducing food waste and improving diet.
“Folks have 100 things they want to talk about… Whatever area you’re interested in about food, just join in the conversation and help others connect to it as well,” said Crista Martin, director for marketing and communications at HUDS.
At the Harvard Community Garden on Monday, HUDS chefs and members of the community highlighted the fresh produce in HUDS's food preparation, as fresh herbs were harvested for the evening's salads.
Highlights for the rest of the week include the weekly Farmer’s Market on Tuesday in the Science Center Plaza, a beekeeping demonstration by the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers on Wednesday, and the Food Better symposium, which will take place on Friday in Boylston Hall. The symposium will feature a number of community partners and farmers, as well as health experts.
The Food Better campaign will continue after this week with the Deans’ Food System Challenge, which begins on Oct. 27. The event, hosted by the Harvard Innovation Lab, is open to interdisciplinary teams comprised of students from various schools across the University. Teams will be asked to find creative solutions to food system challenges all over the world.
“We have so much brain power and creative energy across the University that if we can harness that, and encourage students to come up with innovative ideas about the food system and about improving the food system, we can really make a major impact,” said Ona J. Balkus, a clinical fellow at the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic.
Students are also encouraged to contribute throughout the year by hosting their own Food Better events and activities.
“If you care about really any social justice issues, if you care about health and obesity, it all comes back to the food system, and I think making those connections for people is really important,” Balkus said.

Turkish entrepreneur Murat Ülker donated $24 million to the School of Public Health to create the Sabri Ülker Center for Nutrient, Genetic, and Metabolic Research, the school announced this week.
The gift follows a $350 million donation to HSPH by Hong Kongese billionaire and alumnus Gerald L. Chan, which was unveiled earlier this month.
The Sabri Ülker Center will address chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, according to a Monday press release. The gift will fund work led by Gökhan S. Hotamisligil, the Simmons Professor of Genetics and Metabolism, who is also of Turkish origin.
According to Hotamisligil, the donation will “advance and promote studies in a long-term, unrestricted manner…which allows us to think about things in a longer runway.”
“With rates of chronic metabolic disorders skyrocketing across the globe, this transformational gift comes at a time of great need for resources to support our basic research,” HSPH Dean Julio Frenk said in a press release.
Prior to the donation, Hotamisligil said, there were “not sufficient dollars to follow new paths.”
The gift honors the late Sabri Ülker, the donor’s father, who was a staunch supporter of public health and work safety and founder of Yildiz Holdings, a multinational food manufacturing company.
“We hope this contribution to science will benefit humanity greatly and we have every confidence in Professor Hotamisligil,” said Ali Ülker, grandson of Sabri Ülker and Vice Chairman of the Yildiz Holding Board of Directors, in the press release.

University of California, Berkeley historian Martin E. Jay employed a wide array of “unusual” metaphors to compare Walter Benjamin and Isaiah Berlin in front of a crowded audience in the Center for European Studies on Monday.
Dozens of people crowded the seats, sat on the floor, and lined the back of the room when Jay started the lecture early, kicking off a series of talks this school year held by the Harvard Colloquium for Intellectual History.
Jay, who earned a Ph.D. from Harvard, said he focused on two major Jewish intellectuals—Walter Benjamin and Isaiah Berlin, titans of 20th century Jewish intellectual life—because of his deep respect for both thinkers and his interest in their drastically different personalities and backgrounds.
The audience was surprised by his use of metaphors to compare the two authors, ranging anywhere from hedgehog and fox, husband and lover, and the one Jay argued suited the two authors best: gambler and investor. He felt that was accurate because Benjamin, the gambler, took risks with his theories and in life was constantly in debt and nomadic, while Berlin was a shrewd investor, never really diverting from the popular beliefs of his age, and maintained success throughout his life.
“It was wonderful in the way he brought the personalities of the two authors to life—especially with his comparison of husbands and lovers; it was a very unusual way of talking about intellectual history,” said Howard Eiland, a MIT professor who attended the event and was a co-author of a Benjamin biography Jay mentioned.
Jay said this was his intention—to bring something new to the ongoing discussion of Jewish intellectuals. He wanted to not compare the two in their actual beliefs, but instead their history, styles and places in the world.
“This is an attempt to think about two figures I have written about who are very different, but nonetheless very powerful, still current figures in contemporary discourse, but they represent two very different types of intellectuals,” Jay said.
History professor Peter E. Gordon, a former student of Jay, invited him to speak after being inspired by Jay and learning under him as a graduate student at UC Berkeley.
“Marty is one of the true stars in the field,” Gordon said. “There is no one better than Martin Jay to give a very insightful portrait of these two intellectuals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several employees of the Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel and members of the Student Labor Action Movement set up a bed-making demonstration in the Science Center Plaza Monday afternoon, continuing their year-and-a-half long efforts to support worker unionization at the hotel.
The demonstration built upon a campaign that began after a majority of workers at the hotel signed a petition in March 2013 to launch the process of deciding whether to join UNITE HERE! Local 26, a Massachusetts-based union that represents Harvard’s dining hall employees.
Since then, the workers have staged numerous protests, including a June rally that drew hundreds of protesters. The workers hope that Hilton will be more receptive to their preferred means of unionization if Harvard pressures the company. The hotel is not operated by the University but is located in a Harvard-owned building.
At the demonstration, SLAM members and workers elicited passersby to make a queen-sized bed, which was placed in the center of the plaza. Other SLAM members handed out fliers to raise awareness about working conditions at the hotel.
“We’re trying to show that we think of making beds as an easy chore, but it’s not,” SLAM member Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15 said. “Workers at the Doubletree have to clean twice as many beds as workers in unionized hotels in Boston. They are expected to do an unreasonable amount of work in a short amount of time.”
The DoubleTree workers have received broad support from the community in the past, with endorsements from the Undergraduate Council and Cambridge City Council. Sandalow-Ash said this event was meant to raise awareness among freshmen.
Jessica L. Jin ’18 and Jackson H. Allen ’18 stopped by the Science Center demonstration to make the bed on their way from lunch in Annenberg, wrestling pillows into cases and laying sheets on the bed.
“We have free time, and it looked interesting,” Jin said. “It was stressful, and it’s more physically strenuous than you would imagine.”
Veteran DoubleTree worker Emma Perdomo gave the students pointers as they worked, while SLAM members cheered them on. When the bed was made, Perdomo gave them a grade: a B-minus.
“It was interesting to learn what [the campaign] is all about,” Allen said. “Harvard has a responsibility to make sure that all the businesses and stuff that they own should treat their workers fairly and should pay them for all hard work that they do, as we saw.”
Harvard has maintained its position that the issue should be resolved between Hilton and its employees, according to a July letter from Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communication, to the DoubleTree management.
Company officials do not believe that a true majority of DoubleTree workers wish to be represented by any union for the purposes of collective bargaining, according to comments from a Hilton Worldwide spokesperson last April. Still, DoubleTree workers and students remain persistent in their activism.
“We want to show how hard the housekeeping is,” Perdomo said. “We just are fighting, and we can’t stop because we want labor security and job security. Harvard needs to listen to the housekeepers of the DoubleTree hotel.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a short meeting Monday night, the Cambridge City Council discussed resolutions regarding an information system for incidents of assault in the area, a decrepit playground, and traffic safety regulations.
The first policy order, which was submitted by Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher and adopted after a unanimous vote, came in light of recent assaults at the Fresh Pond Reservation, a nature preserve home to a nine-hole golf course and a trail frequented by runners and cyclists.
According to Maher, there have been two attacks on women at Fresh Pond in the last eight weeks. His proposal, if enacted, would lead to discourse between the Council and the Cambridge Police and Fire Departments about spreading information of such incidents to the public. The purpose, Maher said, is to “make sure that people are aware...and are vigilant.”
Maher said his goal is to ensure that Cambridge residents are warned in a timely fashion.
The Council also discussed opportunities for potential renovation of a playground in North Cambridge. City Manager Richard C. Rossi brought forth the issue of the playground facilities near the Jackson Place Apartments, a pair of four-story buildings.
The Cambridge Housing Authority reviewed the status of the neighborhood’s playground over the summer and deemed that it was operational, outlining a plan for renovations to take place in 2016.
However, this review was found to be inadequate by members of the council, including Councilor Nadeem A. Mazen, who argued that the playground should be renovated more swiftly.
Mazen called attention to the importance of the playground in the community, which he noted is located in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area of Cambridge. He argued that parents will not have another nearby recreational facility to send their children to if the Jackson Place facility is not renovated.
“This community doesn’t feel that it has a safe place for its kids to play, and these problems are often overrepresented in places of poverty,” Mazen said.
James Williamson, a resident of Cambridge, also complained about unsatisfactory conditions of the playground and shared Mazen’s sentiment that it ought to be renovated more quickly.
“The surface is all buckling, the basketball basket has been removed, there are no swings,” Williamson said. “If anyone were to go look at it, they could see in how much disrepair it was. Parents don’t feel comfortable having their young children going over to this...area.”
Williamson also complained of drug use at the playground.
“The use of the space [the playground] is usually for a certain medicinal herb in the evening...making it uncomfortable for other people,” Williamson said.
The City Manager’s proposal for the playground will continue to be evaluated.
The Council also unanimously passed policy orders to investigate the possibility of installing better traffic signs at the intersection of Mass. Ave. and Prospect Street and to park a garbage truck at the Transportation and Public Utilities meeting on Oct. 22 to showcase the new equipment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though men's soccer's Andrew Chang netted Athlete of the Week honors this week, here were some other performances that garner recognition.
Andrew Fischer, Football
Fischer had a career game in the Crimson’s Ivy League opener against Brown on Saturday. The junior scored his first touchdown of the season with 2:11 left in the opening quarter.
Losing his marker and fading out into the far corner of the end zone, the receiver caught junior quarterback Scott Hosch’s lofted nine-yard pass, handing the Crimson an early 6-0 lead. Then, late in the fourth quarter with the Crimson holding onto a two-point lead, Fischer came up with three critical receptions, including one on a third and 12 deep in Crimson territory, as the team marched down almost the entirety of the  field for a touchdown.
The Crimson ended up winning, 22-14, and Fischer finished the game with 12 receptions and 115 yards—both career highs.
Midge Purce, Women’s Soccer
After starting the season with two goals in seven games, Purce has returned to conference play in the same form that earned her Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year last year.
In Saturday night’s game against Penn, the sophomore’s two second half goals led the Crimson to a 3-0 victory in its Ivy League opener. The first of the goals came off a fortuitous ricochet as the forward sprinted through the center of the Penn’s defense. Attempting to stop Purce’s threatening advance, one of Penn’s central defenders stepped into the ball for a tackle. This, however, drastically backfired, sending the ball right back into Purce’s stride and then soaring over the Quaker keeper.
With just over 15 minutes left in the game, Purce bagged another goal, the Crimson’s third, to seal the win over last season’s Ivy League runner ups. Purce was named Ivy League Player of the Week for her performance.
Joey Colton, Men’s Water Polo
Colton put in four standout performances over the weekend as the Crimson took on Brown, Fordham, Iona and St. Francis at Blodgett Pool on Saturday.
Despite splitting the results over weekend, with the losses coming to  Brown and St. Francis and victories to Fordham and Iona, Colton led the team with 12 goals. The sophomore, who led the team in assists last year and contributed with several more over the weekend, was the Crimson’s main offensive threat -- his attacking versatility evident not only by the quantity of goals, but also by their quality.
Highlights included long, powerful shots that skipped off the water and into the goal, and a lob over the Brown goalie that found its way int the far corner of the net.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The whistle blew. The flag flew. The crowd booed. And booed.
That’s the story. But what happened?
Well, maybe nothing. If you consider a football game to be the attempts of two opposing teams to get a brown oval across their respective goal lines, then nothing happened during a stretch of several seconds late in Harvard’s battle with Brown Saturday.
But if football means referees and crowds and television and storylines too, then that moment with just over four minutes remaining might have been the biggest of the night.
Back judge Steve Toal’s helmet-to-helmet targeting call on Brown linebacker Michael Walsh gave Harvard a first down after it appeared the Crimson had been stopped two yards short on third down. Harvard proceeded to march down the field, scoring a touchdown to go up 22-14 with just 2:07 left.
During the drive, Walsh threw down his helmet and tossed his gloves, having been ejected for the hit. That was all he could do. There is no defense for a questionable call. In the press conference after the game, Bears quarterback Marcus Fuller shook his head when the penalty was mentioned. That was all he could do as well.
You could call it a bang-bang play, but it wasn’t. It was a bang play—Fischer catching the ball and turning, Walsh lunging, Fischer bracing, bodies falling. Five years ago, it would have been good football. Saturday, it was a game-defining moment.
Those two perspectives I mentioned earlier? Really, they are both right. Football can be played by a bunch of guys on grass. But what has turned it into this country’s biggest sport is the lights, the stage, and the crowd. Normally those two realms exist independently, though they are layered on top of one another.
Everything else going on in a stadium gives the game its shape and amplifies its importance. But it’s not supposed to impinge on the central action.
When the teams watch game film this week, the referees’ call will not show up. To them and other football purists, the story of Saturday’s game might be the Brown linebacker not staying disciplined in his assignment, allowing junior running back Paul Stanton to bust free for a 43-yard touchdown on a crucial third-quarter third-down. Or maybe the dominating double-team block that allowed Scott Hosch to scamper in for the game’s final touchdown will be the defining moment in their eyes.
But in the stands, the call was the talk.
Modern college football is not just play. It’s part of a show. Everything going on inside the gates is part of that, and the list of actors includes more than just the players.
The referees who control the game become part of that show, particularly when they make a call like Toal’s. At a moment like that, the play gets pushed to the second stage in favor of another part of the show. The actual actions are less important than how the storyline progresses.
The reality of the play matters less than the result of it.
It felt like the 13,511 in attendance were robbed when someone wearing neither Crimson nor Brown impacted play at such a crucial moment. But really, everyone watching got just what he or she asked for. The football was not great in that instance, but the drama was unparalleled.
(Thanks for being patient, now here is some actual analysis.)
Even if that call did not go Harvard’s way, I still think the Crimson would have prevailed Saturday. For a second week, the defense clamped down in the second half, and each touchdown Harvard scored in the last two quarters followed a three-and-out.
On offense, junior quarterback Scott Hosch had some backup moments in place of senior Conner Hempel. He was a bit antsy at times, but completing 70 percent of his passes, he did enough to win. I think.
If Toal’s flag stays in his pocket, Brown would have gotten the ball near midfield needing only a field goal to pull off the upset. This story might have been radically different.
The targeting call was recently introduced as the result of improved concussion research, increased emphasis on player safety, and a general growth of the game’s rulebook—the ultimate instance of the sport's grander narratives affecting play on the field.
As important as those efforts may be, it was a bummer to see the spotlight shift to the game’s stagehands in black and white.
What would have happened if the game could have finished on its own terms?
We will never know.
Boo. That’s all we can do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 8 Harvard coed sailing team raced in three regattas this weekend throughout New England. Despite top-10 finishes in the Hood and President Trophies, the Crimson was unable to qualify for nationals in the NEISA Men's Singlehanded Championship.
32nd PROFESSOR STEDMAN HOOD TROPHY
Harvard’s strongest performance this week came with the fourth place finish at the 32nd Hood Trophy hosted by Tufts University.
Junior co-captains Sydney Karnovsky and Andrew Mollerus took first place in the B division with 11 points. Senior Michael Drumm and freshman Kevin Coakley finished in 10th place for the A division.
Racing only took place on Sunday due to the lack of wind on Saturday.
“The wind was very unstable all weekend,” Drumm said. “This made racing very difficult to be consistent in, and the boats that got ahead early were able to stay ahead and separate from the other boats.”
No. 10 Tufts, Boston University, and No. 1 Yale took the top three spots in this regatta.
“[Mollerus] and [Karnovsky] did a great job of getting out in front early on in the racing,” Drumm said. “We were able to lead the fleet around the course in the 4 races we had, allowing them to win their division and help our team get 4th overall.”
The Crimson practiced on the Jumbos’ waters on Friday to prepare for the weekend and the different type of boat than what the squad typically sails in. Racing was done in Larks opposed to the frequently-sailed 420s or FJs.
“The four of us who raced at Tufts this weekend practiced at Tufts in larks on Friday and this was very helpful this weekend since we were a little more prepared than other schools who had never been in the larks,” Karnovsky said.
PRESIDENT’S TROPHY
Harvard finished in sixth place this weekend in the President’s Trophy hosted by Boston University. Also taking place in the Boston area, the stagnant wind conditions posed a challenge to racing. All races were canceled at two o’clock on Saturday.
The Crimson’s strongest performance came in the B division with junior Sophie Bermudez and senior Ashleigh Inglis taking fourth place with a score of 16, just six points behind the top finishing team from Brown.
Freshman Taylor Ladd and junior Kristina Jakobson tied for ninth place with Bowdoin College in the A division.
In the full results, the Bulldogs from New Haven, ranked No. 1 in the nation, took first place with a combined six points. The scoring level was low in this FJ in-conference regatta due to the lack of wind all weekend limiting the amount of races that took place.
NEW ENGLAND SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIP
Harvard faced its toughest results in the NEISA Men's Singlehanded Championship this weekend. The Crimson sent two sailors to race in this laser regatta but  neither finished in the top spots that would have qualified them for Nationals in November.
Junior Marek Zaleski finished in seventh place with 89 points. Teammate and sophomore Juan Perdomo finished in 10th place. Perdomo took third place at this regatta last fall as a freshman in his breakout performance.
22 sailors from 13 schools competed Saturday and Sunday. Once again, the weather proved to be a major challenge for all the teams.
“This weekend saw light winds across New England,” Mollerus said. “As a result, there were fewer than the scheduled number of races in our three regattas with many of these races being sailed in trying conditions.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks after a sixth-place finish at the Doc Gimmler tournament, Harvard  men’s golf team finished first out of 11 teams at the Quechee Club Invitational in Quechee, Vt. The tournament recorded one of the team’s best individual performances and its first win since the beginning of the season.
This weekend’s competition was hosted by Dartmouth at the Quechee Club, where the Harvard team played on the Lakelands course on the first day and the Highlands course on the second. Round two at the Highlands course consisted of a 6840-yard course for 18 holes and a par of 72.
Having limited time for preparation, the team split into two groups, each practicing on one of the courses and then sharing with each other about what to expect from both.
“As a team, we just focus on trying our best at every shot regardless of what we cannot control,” junior Rohan Ramnath said. “We expect to be able to do our job every time and then whatever happens, happens. There is definitely room for improvement for many of us. But we are still leading the path [on the first day], which is nice.”
The Crimson bested Hartford, its closest competitor, by eight strokes. Both the Crimson and the Hawks  ended the first day with a score of one-over-par (289),  which put them tied for first. However, Harvard stepped up its efforts on the Highlands course on Sunday to out-stroke Hartford with a score of 285 (-3) to claim an uncontested first.
Harvard was the only team to notch a score under-par, as Hartford ended the tournament with a score of six-over-par.
“It is exciting to have the positive reinforcement of the things we have been working on when we do win,” sophomore Kendrick Vinar said. “I think it is really a product of doing things you can control well…and efforts of our team to continue to do the right thing.”
The Crimson’s newest players, freshmen Gregory Royston and Hale Furey, spearheaded the Crimson’s campaign by tying for second and fourth place finishes, respectively. Royston shot an even-par 72 on the second day after fighting back from a three-over-par score at the seventh hole to claim second place. His total score of 142 matched that of Paul Pastore on the Hartford team.
Furey, in his debut tournament for the Crimson, finished up with a score of 69 (-3) in his second round after a first round score of two-over-par to tie for fourth with Brandon Matthews of Temple University.
“We are led by freshman Gregory Royston from South Africa with a two-under-par 70,” said Ramnath at the end of the first day. “He played really well [and] definitely had a great demeanor about him and tied for third after [Saturday].”
Ramnath himself recorded a one-under-par at 71, despite scoring four-over-par on the ninth hole. He finished the tournament with a total score of 147 to tie for 14th place.
“We add up our scores for a team aggregate total, but the best thing that each player can do for the team is just to take care of things that they can do best,” Vinar said.
Vinar finished the tournament with a score of 146, tying for 10th with three players from Brown, Princeton, and Hartford.
University of Pennsylvania’s Austin Powell  achieved top honors in the individual championship with a total score of four-under-par (140). While both Pastore and Royston placed ahead of him in the first round,  Powell came back with a three-under-par score to solidify his first-place finish.
“[The match] is different for everybody,” Vinar said. “Each person communicates with the coach about what they are working on. Each player tries to put himself in the best possible position. We definitely work together and collaborate on strategy. At the end of the day, though,  it is really you and the golf course.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High pressure and high intensity were the names of the game as the women’s soccer team took on University of Massachusetts (2-5-3) at Soldiers Field on Monday. The evenly-matched game resulted in a scoreless draw.
Coming off a victory against the University of Pennsylvania to open its Ivy League schedule, Harvard (7-3-1, 1-0-0 Ivy) entered the game looking to extend its winning streak to four games. The contest marked the end of a four-game road stretch for the Minutewomen that saw them record a tie followed by two straight losses heading into Monday’s tilt.
The Crimson side started off slightly weaker than the UMass side, perhaps because of a discrepancy in the amount of rest for both teams. Harvard had just two days to recover from its most recent match, while UMass had 11.
“I think [lack of rest] had a big effect on us, not to make any excuses. I think we were tired, but we still fought through it,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “I thought our energy was great. It wasn’t for lack of effort, it’s just 90 minutes of soccer is hard, so playing a full 90 minutes on Saturday and then coming here today and playing 110 was definitely a challenge.”
After a relatively slow start in the first 45 minutes of the game, in which neither the Crimson nor the Minutewomen were able to convert opportunities into goals, both sides came out after halftime loud and energetic. Both had multiple chances and shots on goal, and Harvard managed more time of possession than in the previous half.
“We were feeling it,” Margolius said. “I think having the mindset of that toughness and mentality that we knew we had something to fight through was good for us. It lit a fire for us, which was good.”
The Crimson continued to dominate for most of the second period, creating multiple chances from right by the goal to 30 yards out. Sophomore forward Midge Purce and junior forward Emily Mosbacher led the team in shots but were consistently denied by the UMass goalie Cassidy Babin, who finished the game with six saves.
“I think that our choice of shots wasn’t the greatest today,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “The keeper did really well for UMass. I definitely credit her for a lot of that. But we know what we have to correct, and we should’ve got a little bit wider more often.”
All three goalies recorded a shutout on the night. Sophomore Lizzie Durack and senior Cheta Emba split halves in goal for Harvard, with Durack starting the game and Emba playing the second half and overtime.
Midfielder Julia Weithofer recorded four shots to lead UMass’s offensive campaign.
The netminders extended the Crimson’s shutout streak to four games, the longest for Harvard since 2007.
UMass seemed unable to match Harvard’s offensive firepower, playing more defensively for most of the game while orchestrating a few dangerous plays. Late in the game, freshman forward Gabriela Kenyon gave up a foul trying to generate an opportunity, receiving the second yellow card of the night for the Minutewomen. The first was picked up early in the first half by Daniela Alvarez.
With minutes left in regulation time, both sides played with high intensity, but neither managed to break the tie, sending the game into overtime. Despite a solid effort and decent chances for both teams, neither was able to break through for the golden goal, and the teams had to settle for a tie.
“I think it was intense the whole way. We were a little sluggish in the first half, but it was a strong, competitive performance from our team.” Leone said. “We didn’t play our best, but we competed all the way.”
With Ivy League play beginning in earnest on Saturday against Yale, Harvard seeks to build off Monday’s performance as it continues its league title defense.
“We won a lot of first and second balls, which was great,” Margolius said. “That was one of our goals going into the game. I think going into this week of practice we’re going to just do a lot of final third stuff, and make sure that come Saturday, we’re getting a lot of chances and being able to finish those chances.”

Welcome to Trending, your cultural update. This Flyby series will give you the material to impress your friends at the one meal a week that you don't spend complaining about how much work you have to do. It's curated by Flyby's culture experts, who have collectively binge-watched everything Netflix has to offer.
Aretha Franklin (yes, she's still alive! Time to Wikipedia her age.) needs your respect. She's just released a cover of "Rolling in the Deep," which scientists say could stop climate change. It's so great that most babies' first words today are "I love this song." When Franklin sings "There's a fire starting in my heart," the song's first words, you truly believe it.
This is obviously the beginning of Franklin's comeback, as she was most recently famous for wearing a giant bow on her head at President Obama's inauguration.
We're so excited for the acapella groups to cover this cover.
The real controversy over the song has begun with Twitter users ranting at each other over the question: Was the song autotuned? That's the great mystery of 2014 and we can't wait to read more 140 character explanations debating the issue.
Here are some other covers we want Franklin to sing: "Backseat Freestyle" (Kendrick Lamar), "Two Weeks" (FKA Twigs), and "Fancy" (Iggy Azalea). We'll be listening to this on repeat until that day comes.

Horoscopes are obviously the most reliable way to predict your future and explain how you’re feeling. But how often do we consider how the horoscopes of our surroundings—particularly, the Houses in which we reside—might be affecting our own? A little research into the Chinese zodiac signs of the years the Houses were established gives us a clue:
Adams:  This month, Adams residents will be feeling particularly creative, adaptable, and insightful. Although they are always ambitious and over-achieving, the month of October will find them particularly willing to showcase their fiery, passionate personalities. This House was established in the year of the Ram, and has always been known for its ability to create a fun, party atmosphere (not to mention its central location).
Currier: This is a lucky month for Currier, established in the loyal year of the dog. Everything for Currier residents is fated to be on the upswing, from work to school to relationships. For residents of other Houses, an adventure to the Quad may yield some new insights in projects for art, music, or writing.
Cabot: Although Quadlings may be suffering from Harvard’s new policy of Thursday community nights, the fates seem to be looking up for those who are located in this faraway House. October will be a month where its residents are pushed to do their best with strong results. Also consider dining in Cabot if you’re interested in meeting someone new—the stars have aligned for Cabot’s love and relationship traits this month!
Dunster: This month, Dunster residents will enjoy a closer-knit community, and less fragmentation than the month of September presented. Horoscope experts advise that it is not shameful for a Dunster resident to seek help when needed—do not be afraid to ask for aid from others on your path to success!
Eliot: The spirits of Eliot, born in the year of the dragon, have always been known to have good energy. Eliot residents this month should enjoy better health and better wealth, which the House is in desperate need of. Unfortunately, no luck for relationships—the stars have yet again not aligned in favor of you meeting someone new.
Kirkland: A quick observation of the stars reveal that this is gearing up to be a big month for Kirkland residents. There are many opportunities for your work in business, but the experts of the online world also warn that your relationships might be a little volatile, so rely on friends for help—maybe cut back on the housecest?
Leverett: October has a tendency to be turbulent for Leverett residents. Don’t expect for relationships to end, but do expect that it can be rough for a couple days if you live in this House. Between Physics Night and CS 50 office hours, the dhall always seems full of stressed souls.
Lowell: This month, according to Paul Ng, a feng shui and horoscope master based in Toronto, should bring luck, joy, romance, spirituality, and better business if your “business is related to blood.” That last one sounds a little suspicious to us.
Mather: September was a time of conflict for Mather (hello Dunster construction), so this month will be a significant improvement. Your sign bearers will have a generally positive month, and in leadership roles, Mather should shine above the rest (literally: Mather residents of the Tower will work above the rest of Harvard).
Pforzheimer: This House was built in the same Chinese zodiac year, but its residents will enjoy a particularly health-filled month that may allow them to excel in upcoming midterms, sports, or other extracurricular activities. After an ordinary September month, prepare for an amazing October!
Quincy: Yet another House build in the year of the pig, Quincy residents are generally respected for their ability to shine. If you’re a Quincy sophomore having trouble deciding what to concentrate in, have no fear, as your House’s horoscope is slated to be full of smart decision-making this month.
Winthrop: Sometimes, the spirits of Winthrop might have felt that the world was against them, but October is fated to be one of the best months for Winthrop residents in a long, long time (no more drainage backups?). You may find that you are able to speak your mind more easily this month, so tell the world about your love of Throp!
