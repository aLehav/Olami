After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We made it! It’s the first day of the 2021 Cannes Film Festival, and Sofi and I have been in France for a dizzying and wonderful two days so far.
We spent yesterday in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, a lovely town about 20 minutes from Cannes where my friend Salomé is super generously letting us stay at her Mom’s apartment. I knew things were off to a great start when I found myself standing next to MJ Rodriguez (Blanca in “Pose”) at baggage claim immediately after landing at the Nice airport. She was incredibly kind and elegant — and wearing stilettos — at five in the morning, and I’m truly in awe. I breathlessly attempted to tell her how much I love her and how much her groundbreaking portrayal of a trans Latinx woman of color meant to some of my close friends.
After that edifying experience, the jet lag caught up to me, and I channelled my sleep-deprived furor into some chaotic commentary on the arguably-even-more-chaotic film “Holy Motors.” (Our co-film exec Lanz had encouraged me to watch it in preparation for Cannes’ opener “Annette” by the same director.) It grew on me though, and I’m even more excited now for whatever Leos Carax has in store with “Annette.”
For the end of our first day in France, we took a lovely boat ride with Salomé’s family. The weather was picture-perfect, and Salomé’s grandma made us the best quiche I have ever had in my life. We also got to watch them show off some pretty impressive water skiing skills.
Day two started bright and early at 7:30 a.m. We had to be out of the apartment by eight, so we pushed through the jet lag, chugged the first of many coffees, and ran to the bus stop just in time to barely miss the early bus. Once we finally got to Cannes, we waited in the same (wrong) line twice in a row as we struggled to collect our press badges, get our Covid-19 tests, and ensure that we weren’t accidentally breaking any safety protocols. I dragged Sofi shopping and tried on at least six different pairs of black sandals before I finally found the right ones, then proceeded to drink at least three more black iced coffees as we scoured the area for wifi.
Finally, we got our test results and met up with local-Crimson-celebrity and former Arts Chair Caroline Tsai, who’s now covering the festival as a freelancer for not one but two (three?) professional outlets. Caroline got us up to speed on exactly how to meet Leonardo DiCaprio and avoid the dreaded review backlog, then shared us on her incredible Cannes-masterlist-spreadsheet (it’s truly beautiful). As we waited for the first film of the festival “Annette,” we caught a glimpse of Jessica Chastain (lovely as ever) just a few feet away from us as she entered the red carpet.
I got chills as I finally shuffled into my seat in the Debussy theater and waited for the first film of the festival. I’ve dreamed of being here since I was a freshman, and no matter what the rest of the week holds, today has exceeded my highest expectations. Sitting in a theater surrounded by some of the world’s best (and sweatiest) arts journalists and having the opportunity to add my voice to the hundreds of people who will watch “Annette” tonight, I couldn’t be more grateful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Klara Jelinkova, the vice president for international operations and IT at Rice University, will become Harvard’s next vice president and chief information officer, the University announced Tuesday.
Jelinkova has worked at Rice for more than six years. Previously, she was CIO and senior associate vice president at the University of Chicago and held senior positions in IT at Duke University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
In an interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication — Jelinkova said she is “absolutely delighted” to head Harvard’s IT department after she begins her role on Sept. 13.
“I look forward to working closely with the strong HUIT team to build on their successes and to pursue new and exciting opportunities in support of the academic and research endeavors of Harvard into the future,” she said.
Jelinkova succeeds Anne H. Margulies, who retired as University CIO in May after holding the position for over a decade. During her tenure, she merged IT services that had previously been separated between the University’s central administration and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences into the current HUIT department, which provides support for both students and faculty.
At Rice, Jelinkova similarly created a new “central” IT organization, and helped set the framework for a migration to remote learning in March 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Jelinkova chaired the IT division’s Equity and Diversity Committee while at the University of Wisconsin.
Jelinkova told the Gazette that her dedication to equity, diversity, and inclusion is based on her experience as an immigrant from what is now the Czech Republic.
“I am grateful that I have always found the places where I have worked to be committed to including different voices, and this is a commitment I share deeply in my own work,” she said.
Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said to the Gazette that she is “delighted” Jelinkova is joining the University as its new CIO.
“She so clearly gets it that success is about more than just the ‘hardware’ of technology and resources; it’s also about the ‘software’ of people and culture,” Gay said. “She has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to equity, inclusion, and belonging in the teams she has led and fostered strong and collaborative relationships with faculty, researchers, staff, and students to ensure that her work was aligned with their needs and interests.”
Jelinkova worked to prioritize cybersecurity at Duke and the University of Chicago as well as Rice, where she helped faculty secure their research data.
Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 told the Gazette that Jelinkova’s commitment to cybersecurity will be a welcome addition to the University.
“Throughout her career, Klara has worked closely with faculty to offer the information technology support they need for their research and teaching,” Garber said. “She understands that the modern university cannot thrive unless it protects data security and privacy, while at the same time it ensures the free exchange of ideas.”
“She is an innovator who appreciates that these two goals are not in conflict. They are complementary,” Garber added.
