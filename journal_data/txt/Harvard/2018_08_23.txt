After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We’re going through mono as a country,” Jonathan Van Ness (“Queer Eye,” “Gay of Thrones”) said at San Francisco’s Outside Lands music festival on Saturday, where he was hosting a special live version of his podcast, “Getting Curious,” in front of a live audience. His cure for mono? His first guest—Michelle Wolf.
“You’re kind of like the new Beyoncé of comedy,” Van Ness said to Wolf.
“If I could wear a leotard, I would,” she said. “She really revolutionized not wearing pants.” Wolf, who wrote for “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah” and now has her own Netflix series, made waves earlier this year at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as its 2018 featured speaker. In her 19-minute act, Wolf made a joke about White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ eye makeup. “She burns facts, and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smoky eye. Like maybe she’s born with it, maybe it’s lies. It’s probably lies,” Wolf said about Sanders. The controversial joke drew mixed reactions from journalists, comedians, and president Donald Trump himself, who tweeted “the so-called comedian really ‘bombed.’” Wolf and Van Ness touched upon the infamous moment at the show. “I had a lot of jokes about her [Sanders’] and Kellyanne [Conway’s] appearance that I took out,” Wolf said.
Later on in the show, Van Ness and Wolf started talking about comedy in broader terms, discussing its purpose in comparison to former First Lady Michelle Obama’s famous “When they go low, we go high” quote.
“We’re comedians. That’s our job—to go low,” Wolf said. “It’s like boxing. You get to punch everything. Float like a butterfly and punch all the butterflies,” she added.
It wasn’t long after this that Van Ness had to switch gears, which he did several times in the show, sometimes unintentionally (at the start, he gave a warning about his affinity for drifting off into tangents, concerned with keeping time for the one-hour show.) But in this case, it was pre-planned—his next guest arrived on stage: Florence Welch of Florence + The Machine, who happened to be the Outside Lands headliner of the night.
After taking a few selfies on stage, Wolf left and Welch took her seat as Van Ness’ second guest of the day. The two didn’t talk about politics, but chatted about childhood style icons (Spice Girls and Gwen Stefani for Welch), Welch’s new album “High as Hope,” and their past meetings. Welch started off the conversation by describing an outfit her 10-year-old self thought was cool: purple crushed velvet fleurs, Buffalo brand boots, and a Simpsons sweater.
“We all have eras,” Van Ness said, who talked about a purple Barney jumper he loved as a child. Eventually, the two transitioned to talking about “High as Hope,” and the process it took for Welch to create the album.
“It was so painful to make,” Welch said. “I literally crawled in to make that album a week after I quit drinking.” But Welch warned against relying on self-destruction as a creative tool. “Vulnerability can be strength,” she added.
One of the most vulnerable moments on her new album comes in the first line of “Hunger”: “At 17, I started to starve myself,” an allusion to an eating disorder Welch struggled with when she was younger.
“I didn’t even know you were allowed to talk about it,” she said. “I didn’t even know you were allowed to put it into song.”
Baring her soul might have been difficult for Welch, but she did so at the show, talking about more of the complexities that went into making the album, like generational trauma. “Things are really difficult,” she said. “But you hope for peace.”

Shannon and the Clams is a rising name in alternative and punk coming out of Oakland, CA. Featuring members Shannon Shaw (vocals, bass), Cody Blanchard (vocals, guitar), Will Sprott (keys, vocals), and Nate Mahan (drums, vocals), the band combines ’50s and ’60s doo-wop pop and proto-rock with ’80s-style lo-fi punk. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Shannon and the Clams after their performance at Panorama on Sunday.

The Harvard Crimson (THC): Shannon released her solo project, “Shannon in Nashville,” and “Onion,” the band’s latest work, came out in February, both very exciting. But what’s next for Shannon and the Clams?

Cody Blanchard (CB): We’re mostly just doing a little bit of touring through the end of the year. We’re coming back to New York in November.

THC: Tell me more about the trajectory of the albums. You guys have a lot of interesting influences you’ve mentioned. What direction are you headed in now, and what was involved in your latest album, “Onion?”

Cody: I feel like we’ve been leaning more psychedelic. Nate Mahan (NM): There are some sort of glam elements creeping in.CB: Maybe none of that made it on the record but there were some disco feelings, maybe the second song—it’s a light touch.

THC: Tell me more about “Clams” specifically. Why clams over mollusks, or any other animal out there?

Shannon Shaw (SS): Honestly the worst thing about our band is the name. It just kind of happened. It started off as a joke because I started off as a solo performer. I just sang and played bass. So it was like a joke to be called Shannon and the Clams. And then the name stuck and we kind of took off and it felt too late to change the name.

THC: Cody, you broke a string on stage. Does that sort of thing happen often? Do you have a story about a worst technical malfunction that’s happened to you on show?

NM: I have one. The second show I ever played with the Clams, we were playing at this tiny bar in Eureka and at some point both Shannon’s bass and vocals cut out. And me and Cody just vamped the song for like five to 10 minutes, just holding it down. And eventually Shannon’s bass came back on and we finished the song, but it was like 15 minutes.

SS: And it was something culty, right?

NM: Yeah, it was the “The Cult Song.” Yeah, we just vamped it, it was great.

THC: So you mentioned “The Cult Song,” and I was listening to “The Bog” on my way here. Would you say there’s an aspect of the occult in your music or just general cult stuff?

CB: Yes.

SS: Yeah, actually I really liked what you said about it yesterday. You were talking about how you relate musically to California.

CB: When the hippie utopian psychedelia started to get sort of dark in the late ’60s and there were different California cults, some of the music that came from there and music inspired by that stuff is like really relatable. I feel like that’s where “The Bog“ comes from. But I also used to read a lot of H.P. Lovecraft. And I think it’s funny to put it in pop songs. There’s a period of dark psychedelic folk from the West Coast that’s very cool to me.

Will Sprott (WS): You ever see that documentary about the Source Family?

THC: No, I haven’t seen it.

WS: It’s about this cult in California that they recorded, and they recorded hundreds of albums of music—and it’s good. I think that’s the one that started as a health restaurant called The Source in LA. And then it gradually evolved into this humongous cult. And it ended with Father Yod driving a hang glider off of a cliff in Hawaii.

SS: Have you seen “Wild Wild Country?”

THC: I’ve been meaning to watch that. I’ve heard really interesting things.

SS: Oh my gosh put down everything, leave the festival, go watch that documentary. It’s amazing how much footage they have. Also “Holy Hell” is a really good documentary about another California called like Marin County.

THC: So you guys are really into the whole cult thing…

SS: Well, I didn’t realize I was.

CB: Me and Shannon also come from Mormon heritage. That’s cult-lite.

THC: Should I take this out of the interview? Do you guys play Salt Lake City often?

SS: They love it; they always beg us to play “The Cult Song.” A lot of our fans are varying degrees of Mormon—ex Mormons, current Mormons, in between. I love it, I was raised Mormon. But Nate’s great-grandpa had like 10000 wives.

NM: He had five wives and 56 children, off in the south west of Utah. He was a pioneer Mormon.

THC: Wow, so there’s a lot of Mormon roots in the group. Do you think that influences or informs the music?

NM: I just think it’s like a strange thing.

SS: You know what though, I wonder if that’s why I love harmonies and stuff so much.

CB: Like hymns and shit?

SS: That was my favorite part of church. I didn’t start singing until I was like 25. Attending church I would hold up the hymnbook and just go like, “oooooohhh, haaa, heeee.” Because I couldn’t read, I was so little, I would just make up words and open the book and take it really seriously because I loved how it physically felt when you are singing and feel it in your chest and feel other people’s voices making you buzz. I loved that.

WS: We were just listening to this great podcast, “Cocaine and Rhinestones.” Have you heard that?

THC: No, I can’t say I have.

CB: It’s about the history of country music. The Newman Brothers are a weird harmony group, they’re very religious.

WS: And they stand in a circle and sing these weird harmonies, it’s supposed to be really cool sounding.

SS: Somebody talked about familial harmony?

NM: yeah you can sing crazy harmonies with your family. A blood harmony.

THC: I’ve heard that, yeah. HAIM does a lot of harmony and they’re all sisters. But that’s some juicy stuff there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was supposed to rain. Fortunately for the 100,000 Lollapalooza attendees treading the same dirt at Grant Park, and especially for Crimson reporters who only brought one pair of shoes, the soil only dampened from spilled 10-dollar Bud Lights, the occasional vomit, and the sweat in the 86-degree Chicago heat. In an unexpected, probably liability-reducing act of charity, Lolla provides “hydration stations,” where you can refill your water bottle or nine-dollar Bud for free.

All Time Low made the best of their set in that midday sun. Afforded some extra room by the rather early weekday time slot, the crowd head-banged and clapped along to the tight pop punk beats and close harmonies on recent single “Everything Is Fine” and 2009 deep cut “Stella.” More impressively, frontman Alex Gaskarth nearly pulled off what appeared to be a non-ironic product placement for Tito’s Vodka, the sponsor of their stage. It seemed like an authentic endorsement until he later tried to do the same for a water bottle, but apparently named the wrong brand: “Get the product placement right!” he told himself.

Across the festival at the Grant Park main stage, Franz Ferdinand performed an excellent hour. Even Lolla’s world-class sound mixing can struggle to stay clear in the endless expanse of the main-stage audience area, but the Glaswegian indie rockers’ punchy hooks and straightforward arrangements sounded gorgeous. Lead singer Alex Kapranos’s presence, vulnerable and earnest yet cool and detached, translated well to the scale. “I see a Scottish flag, and it makes me feel so much joy and homesickness,” he said. Later, he asked the crowd to note the beauty of the downtown skyline behind them and dedicated the next song to the city of Chicago. Delighting the attendees, the guitars launched into their signature song, “Take Me Out.” Not even the dad with a small child on his shoulders could resist jumping along with the power chords.

LANY’s electronica-inflected dream pop represented a bit of a come-down, especially when technical difficulties forced vocalist Paul Jason Klein to do a solo piano ballad. But they recovered well. The live setting lent their massive hits “Super Far” and “ILSYB” more energy, if at the expense of the blissed-out, reverb-soaked sound that characterizes their records. LANY already has too many Spotify streams for their non-headlining 5:45 time slot to make sense—except for the fact that they have only released one album. Expect to see them billed much higher next time.

In the day’s low point, Lolla displayed a Fortnite tournament—yes, you heard right—at full volume on the main stage during Camila Cabello’s set on the directly-opposite Lake Shore stage. The former Fifth Harmony star best known for “Havana” carried on with a tight, energetic set complete with impressive dance routines, but what were they thinking? Airing the sound of machine-gun fire from the battle-simulator game was especially ill-conceived: Lolla 2018 is not only less than a year removed from the Las Vegas festival shooting but also only a few miles from the march on Lake Shore Drive aimed at forcing the whiter and more affluent North Side to pay attention to the South Side’s gun violence and police brutality. Lolla, with its decidedly white and affluent attendees, spectacularly missed that memo.

In some ways, Arctic Monkeys looked as vintage as they could: the letters “MONKEYS” appeared behind the stage in old-timey off-white, and the gargantuan main-stage screens showed the band in grayscale (a somewhat pretentious but admittedly cool look). In others, they looked unmistakably contemporary: Frontman Alex Turner sweated valiantly under a very hip button-up, at least until yielding and stripping to his undershirt, and wore clear sunglasses on his shaved head. Much like their most recent album, “Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino,” it either represented a brilliant synthesis of retro and modern or an identity crisis for Britain’s biggest band.

That album, which divided both critics and fans, showed the growing art-rock ambitions of the former garage-indie quartet. Likewise, their Lolla set was more Pink Floyd than The Strokes from the very beginning: They entered to ominously flashing red lights and began with a track from “Tranquility Base,” “Four Out of Five.” Throughout, their 2013 songs from “AM” and “Tranquility Base” worked better than their older material—partly because the massive festival speakers could better handle their simpler and more spaced-out sounds, partly because the tired end-of-day crowd was largely more ready to groove than to rock out, but mostly because “Star Treatment” better fits the band’s current look and presence than “I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor.” And Arctic Monkeys simply seem more interested in playing their space-rock than post-punk.

Still, they interspersed old favorites (and some surprising minor tracks) from “Humbug” and “Favourite Worst Nightmare,” though notably not mega-hit “Fluorescent Adolescent,” with the songs from their last two albums. Wisely, they saved the most popular “AM” tracks—the question-mark trio of “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?,” “Do I Wanna Know?,” and “R U Mine?”—for the show’s second half. In a somewhat unusual move for Lolla acts, they included an extended encore, running 20 minutes over their allotted 75-minute headliner slot. Fans who remained were rewarded with “Star Treatment,” “Snap Out of It,” and “R U Mine?,” hits (from the last two albums) whose familiarity made them an ideal end of the night.

Arctic Monkeys’ future experiments, whether with Dr. Dre-inspired beats or space-themed concept albums or something else entirely, will likely evince a continuing battle between the old and new. We’ll see whether their next era will take rock into the 2020s and save the album itself or send them backsliding into nostalgia. But at Lolla, the old was the new: The ’70s-esque, album-oriented lounge pop of “Tranquility Base,” even in black and white, seemed to point the way forward (at least for the band) more than their 2000s modern rock or even the hip-hop of “AM.”

Speaking frankly, I came into this performance with a bit of unease. From what I had seen of Dua Lipa’s work, I’d formed a conception of the artist as undeniably talented but an emotional enigma, the same way a caged tiger paces the floor with cloaked ferocity or a riptide rages beneath an otherwise placid surface. I was curious, but tentatively nervous, to see how that persona might translate live in front of such a large audience that might not be familiar with her music. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised: Dua Lipa hit her stride quickly, extending her trademark cool air to a set that held onto the audience with a light grasp rather than a stranglehold.
The set started off rocky. The opening monologue, featuring the pithy, borderline vacuous encouragement “Tonight I want you to be yourself. Your authentic true self” felt a bit too much like an unoriginal, lowest common denominator appeal uncharacteristic of Dua. Though a single statement generally doesn’t derail a set—she very much rectified this hiccup with plenty of more convincing, energetic empowerment later on—it was a squandered opportunity to set the tone from the beginning. The sound mixing for the first few songs was also hit-or-miss. While aggressive drum backing worked in her opening number “Blow Your Mind (Mwah),” the instrumentals almost drowned out her verses in “Dreams.” I had worried about a lack of stage presence coming in, but in an ironic twist of events, it was actually the overcompensated heavy-handedness that felt the most out of place.
As the songs got poppier and Dua began to lean into her choreography, though, the performance vastly improved. “No Lie,” a Sean Paul song originally featuring Dua Lipa, washed out the droning drumwork of the songs before with a dollop of trop-pop, functioning unexpectedly effectively as a cover and dance track. “Be the One” brought the show to literal new dimensions, as both the singer and her backup dancers climbed onto and performed from elevated surfaces. Seemingly not content with just performing up on the stage, she had guards hoist her up to tower over the barricade, where she led the crowd in several rounds of “One Kiss.” Dua functioned best when she was absorbed in her carefully calculated moves, emitting an unbothered effortlessness. It’s resoundingly clear she goes that paradoxical extra mile of putting in the labor not to look like she’s trying too hard, which works well for her.
Dua’s performance structure maintains this detached air by not forcing interactions with her audience. She’s not one for small talk, entreating listeners to respond to what is presented to them onstage as they deem most appropriate. At times, this means throwing hands in the air during the EDM-laced drops of songs like “Scared To Be Lonely.” At other times, the audience is meant to take a more passive role, watching the backup dancers on stage move through a freeform routine which ends in embrace. A warning slide before “IDGAF” offered a light suggestion to “put your middle fingers up” if one felt so compelled (many in the crowd did). This is the Dua that invites participation but won’t beg for it, and her audience as a result is all too happy to oblige.
In the end, Dua didn’t need to rely on sheer force of personality to carry her to success. Much as a pro-bowler tosses their prize ball roll along and allows the pins to fall where they will, the artist allowed her choreographed hits—painstakingly polished, packing plenty of inertia—to barrel into the crowd of spectators without needing to constantly stoke a reaction from her viewers. This isn’t indifference; she obviously cares about her art. What she’s too cool to care about, though, is demanding audiences to eat it up. But they did regardless.

The founders of musical projects Japanese Breakfast and Jay Som are notable in the music industry for being female, queer, Asian American, and outspoken about those identities. Panorama featured both on Saturday, giving viewers a sample of the movement that Vice described last year as “making room for Asian American women in a genre that has long been dominated by white dudes.”

Publications have recently celebrated diversity at 2018’s music festivals and also lamented where they fall flat. Remezcla applauded the number of Latino artists at Panorama, and the blog Beauty Within described the seven Asian American artists playing Coachella. On the gloomier side, Pitchfork ran the data on 2018’s 20 biggest multi-genre festivals and found that only three achieved gender balance. (Pitchfork and Panorama topped the list, and third came FYF, which was canceled.)

On Saturday afternoon, Melina Duterte's California-based musical project called Jay Som performed its lo-fi dream pop and rock from her latest album, “Everybody Works” and ended with her recent single “Pirouette.” Two sets later, Oregon-born Michelle Zauner’s project Japanese Breakfast broke out its indie pop compositions, including “Machinist” and “Boyish.”

Yaeji, a house DJ whose lyrics bounce between English and Korean, had been scheduled to perform Friday night’s last set at The Point, where she might have played her hit “Raingurl” had her performance not been rained out. Also scheduled and canceled was R&B artist Jhené Aiko, who has Japanese heritage and uses her Japanese middle name in her moniker.

Panorama attendees Thuy Tong and April McMullan had come to watch Jay Som and Japanese Breakfast after seeing them on tour with fellow Asian American indie rocker Mitski in 2016. Tong said that seeing Asian American artists made her feel inspired: "That's my people," she said.

Kimberly Frechette and Tim Reilly had seen Japanese Breakfast at Music Hall of Williamsburg, and at Panorama they attended Jay Som’s and Japanese Breakfast’s sets. Frechette said, “It’s not very common that you see Asian American artists playing these days, so I think it's great."

Frechette said she loves Japanese Breakfast’s energy. “Her outfit today was also killer,” she said, echoing attention that Zauner has recently gained for her style. Reilly added, "I think the coolest thing about Japanese Breakfast is that it started out as her solo project after her mother died, and she was able to use that sad energy to create something so positive for fans to enjoy.”

In addition to creating a space for Asian American artists, Jay Som and Japanese Breakfast have given visibility to queerness in their art. For example, Japanese Breakfast’s “Everybody Wants to Love You” is about Zauner’s “relationship with a woman who has no idea I wrote it for her,” she wrote in a tweet. Jay Som has spoken about being inspired by the queer community, and Yaeji’s work has become part of an Asian-American queer nightlife scene.

Reflecting on Mitski, Japanese Breakfast, and Jay Som’s 2016 tour, McMullan said, "It was cool that the lineup was so queer, and [so full of] people of color."

"When you bring queer people in, it opens up a dialogue of inclusivity,” Tong added.

On my way to Panorama Stage, I ran into a friend from high school. “My friend and I came here with the sole purpose of seeing The Killers,” my former classmate said. I was more skeptical. While The Killers are versatile enough to be labeled as at least five types of rock and pack their choruses with an impressive amount of vitality, I was not sure what had made them so popular that they could close Panorama. I never understood, either, why the 15-year-old “Mr. Brightside” is still a Harvard party fixture and was crowned “Song of the Decade” by radio stations.

What is the inescapable draw of The Killers? This question became especially confounding as the night went on and The Killers seemed more and more determined to keep their performance devoid of meaning.

The stage setup, for starters, was aggressively generic. Every prop was an empty symbol that conveyed no feeling, place, or time period. I noted a lone water tower labeled “New York” and a couple of neon arrows. A large “male” symbol (the circle and arrow kind) stood by frontman Brandon Flowers' perch, and three “female” ones stood in front of the three backup singers.

Baffled, I asked my former classmate, "What is up with those signs?"

"It's pretty clear," her friend said. "It means the male stands here, the females stand here."

To add a new iteration of meaninglessness, Flowers repurposed a Martin Luther King Jr. nonviolence quote, which he failed to attribute to its author, so he could request a phone-waving light fest: “There is a quote that I love,” Flowers said. “‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.’ If there was ever a song that asked for your lights, this is it.” This quote usage seemed irresponsible when I remembered that 24 hours prior, Janet Jackson had projected over the same stage a warning about domestic terrorism and white supremacy groups. But now, the phones went up in synchrony, blissfully expressing no moral convictions.

It’s not that their music is shallow. Their lyrics cover some truly fascinating topics, like Flowers’ struggles with Mormonism in “All These Things That I’ve Done” and unnamed news scandals in “Run for Cover.” “The Man,” one of my favorites, is a biting satire of Flowers’ former arrogance.

But somewhere on the path to live performance, they buried their own complexity under bravado and neon. I was disappointed that they included their “Run for Cover” video (which not only takes the words too literally but also rips off Radiohead’s “Karma Police” film) but not their self-deprecating “The Man” film (they replaced it with a neon outline of—guess what?—a man). Though Flowers’ show of egotism during “The Man” was exactly what the sarcastic lyrics and red-hot bass called for, the fact that he exhibited the same demeanor in every other number, complete with dazzling grins, made the irony of that disco jam undetectable.

These generic tendencies, however, served The Killers well in one way: They reached an amazing level of inclusivity. Like their stage props, their songs became one-size-fits-all shells that fans could fill with their own memories, meanings, and enthusiasm.

In one especially sweet moment, the band granted the wish of a young, bespectacled fan named Brendan bearing a sign for drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr.: “May I Play Drums President Vannucci #2020.” The young drummer was brought onto the stage, kept a steely focus through “For Reasons Unknown,” and afterward broke into a smile that never seemed to end.

Curious to learn more about fans’ devotion to The Killers, I turned to my peers. A few themes emerged: nostalgia, social experiences, and ambivalence about the tune. My first-year roommate, Grace K. Bannister ’21, answered my impromptu text by relating the song to middle-school punk memories. She also described what she called a “mob mentality” effect: “If most of the group thinks a song is lit, everyone else just goes along and suddenly it’s a banger,” she wrote. The friend I ran into at Panorama, who attends the University of Michigan, also recounted communal experiences when I asked why she was excited about the show. “We go to the football game every weekend, and we hear ‘Mr. Brightside’ at least four times at each game,” she said. But did she actually like the song? “It’s fine,” she said.

Meanwhile, my brother, Andrew R. Chow ’14, believed The Killers benefited from nostalgia not just across semesters but also across musical eras—specifically, a memory of the Bruce Springsteen days when rock stars could command the stage with guitars.

However, my friends could not agree on whether the song felt like punk sarcasm or pumped-up positivity. Sunday’s “Mr. Brightside,” and, in fact, the set as a whole, walked that line deftly without needing to make the decision. The message was up to the watchers, and that was part of the magic.

My roommate had also texted me that “Mr. Brightside” should be the climax of any good party. Likewise, Panorama attendees knew it would be this three-day party’s closer. As The Killers reentered for their encore, I thought I might finally be able to hear the energy that has set parties ablaze around the world. But I couldn’t hear the band at all—the crowd drowned it out. This was fitting. The euphoric mob’s singing was all that mattered.

As my friends’ anecdotes and Sunday’s show suggested, the band’s remarkable knack for charming a broad populace has less to do with the music itself and more to do with the context in which the music is presented. In the future, they might find a way to captivate live audiences without undercutting the complexity of their own work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Saturday, and my friends and I are roaming around Harvard Square after a party. We get nachos and someone suggests we head across the street to the Phoenix S.K., one of Harvard’s all-male final clubs. At the stoop, there’s a guy manning the door. “Hi, can we come in?” He looks at us, and for unclear reasons, asks how many of us are freshmen. “None of us.”
The guy looks at each of us again. “Ok.” He opens the door, and we climb past him and enter. Inside, there are some girls I don’t recognize and guys I assume are members. They’re lounging around and playing slap cup around a big wooden table in the center of the room. One friend and I are tired, so we stand to the side. No one tries to talk to us; we tap through our phones. After about fifteen minutes, we leave.
Nothing about this is particularly traumatizing. There is no leering, no groping, no onslaught of lewd comments. But the exercise of submitting myself for judgment, the small flash of validation when I’m allowed in, and the way I become just a bit more self-conscious stepping inside all stick with me uneasily.
This is a typical social experience for many girls at Harvard. In our social culture, men own the mansions on Mount Auburn St. that house several male-only final clubs, collectively an important source of parties.
In a retrospective on the history of men and women at Harvard, Drew Faust wrote, “Harvard is still in transition to a state in which men are not the norm.” On a Saturday night out, it’s a different decade. I have no place, no stature, not much to offer. But then the sun comes up, the high heels are exchanged for backpacks, and I am expected to reintegrate seamlessly back into 2018. At Harvard, this anachronistic system in which men exercise control over the most prominent and desirable social assets is normal. And it enforces a toxic power dynamic that is wildly antithetical to the College’s mission of developing promising young people into citizens and leaders.
In the current status quo, all-male final clubs ordain a select group of boys as arbiters of popularity on campus, imparting them with legitimacy and social capital. The guy at the door is not looking at you as a classmate or peer. Instead, you are an object, and he is deciding whether he wants you in his clubhouse for his friends’ enjoyment. Girls in this context may be sought after — but we are seldom respected or admired. The clubs preserve a world where permission and validation come directly from male approval, where a nod from one of the guys is a valuable ticket into the fold. Friends and equals become gatekeepers and providers. Power, membership, and status are male attributes.
I’m always asked, “Katherine, if girls think final clubs are so bad, why don’t you just stop going to their parties?” Last spring, I was at dinner with friends when talk turned to the Spee’s Eurotrash party that night, to which the majority of the girls at the table had received invites. (Naturally, I hadn’t gotten the email, and sat there awkwardly pushing food around my plate as people planned costumes.) Did I have a burning urge to go to Eurotrash? No ... Did I want to sit in my room alone while everyone else went to Eurotrash? Of course not!
I’m not up in arms over the finer details of specific invitation or membership lists. But the broader ramifications of this incredibly male-dominated social culture are quietly devastating, and twofold.
One. When attractive, wealthy, high-status males are consistently surrounded — in their own cushy clubhouse — by eager girls to whom they have generously granted the privilege of entrance, what ideas about the place of females does it create among people who are likely going to become successful and influential? This setup is quite invaluable in educating privileged men on how to exercise power over women who are seeking their validation.
And two. What does it do to the minds of competitive, ambitious young women when we are constantly compelled, at our own school, to act as the guests and pretty objects of our ostensible equals — boys who, during the day, we are urged to compete against and collaborate with in our classes and extracurriculars? How is it fair that, at one moment, I’m supposed to argue on behalf my ideas and strive for leadership positions and reach toward opportunities, but come nighttime, I suddenly become a second-class citizen, my fate at the door contingent on the opinions and desires of my supposed peers?
The College is an intellectual community that I love, and our social culture informs expectations for men, women, and how they should interact. Partying at 1 a.m. at the Fly may seem outside Harvard’s educational purview — but it is certainly giving lessons in something. I’m told we are educating future citizen-leaders here. It’s time to ask: What are we teaching them?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s emails welcoming Harvard students back to campus are typically short and sweet.
In a 2016 email, he suggested that undergraduates should post on social media using the hashtag “#WelcometoHarvard.” In a 2017 missive, he discussed his reading list over break (spoiler: he read a lot of Harvard College Alumni Class Reports).
This year was different.
In an email titled “Welcome Home” and sent to students on Monday, Khurana devoted four paragraphs — equivalent to 343 words or about 40 percent of the message — to the ongoing lawsuit charging Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
That suit, filed in 2014 by anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, is set to go to trial on Oct. 15. Harvard has repeatedly denied allegations of discrimination.
“As you prepare to return to campus, you may be following the news reports about the admissions lawsuit,” Khurana wrote. “Some of these reports may have raised questions for you about how or why you were accepted to Harvard.”
The summer certainly saw a lot of news reports. Ever since hundreds of pages of documents detailing the internal workings of Harvard’s admissions office became public as part of the lawsuit in early June, news outlets across the country — and their editorial boards — pounced on the thread.
There was the revelation that an internal Harvard review had found that the College’s admissions process produces “negative effects” for Asian Americans. There was the news that Harvard’s legacy admission rate is five times that of non-legacies. There was the report that admits to Harvard’s legendary  “Z-list,” a very small deferred admissions pool, are overwhelmingly white and tend to have parents who attended the College.
There was also the discovery that Harvard maintains a “dean’s interest list,” also known as a “director’s interest list” — a special, internal list of applicants who are connected to Harvard in some way or who are of interest to donors.
Not to mention the editorials. “Harvard is Wrong That Asians Have Terrible Personalities,” wrote a guest columnist for the New York Times. “On affirmative action, Harvard can’t have it all,” from the Washington Post’s Charles Lane. “Harvard’s ‘secret sauce’ is a secret shame,” blared the New York Post’s editorial board.
“You may also have read commentary questioning the integrity of the undergraduate admissions process and whether colleges and universities really need a diverse student body to fulfill their educational missions,” Khurana wrote. “I believe strongly that diversity and excellence go hand in hand.”
He informed every student that they are more than their statistics — more than their SAT score, their GPA, their race, ethnicity, sport, or legacy status. Khurana wrote that students are, instead, the sum of their passions, experiences, and dreams.
He wrote that his top priority as Dean of the College is to ensure that all undergraduates — regardless of gender, race, religion, sexuality, or socioeconomic status, among other things — feel embraced by Harvard.
“Let me be very clear — every one of you belongs at Harvard College,” he wrote.
Khurana linked in his email to a University-run website that outlines Harvard’s position on the admissions lawsuit. The dean urged students with questions about the suit to visit the site.
The website, which went up several months ago, calls the case a “politically motivated lawsuit” and states Edward Blum, the man behind the suit, “wants to remove the consideration of race in college and university admissions,” something Blum himself previously acknowledged to The Crimson in an email.
“The motivation behind the lawsuit is to end racial classifications and preferences in university admissions,” Blum wrote.
Analysts have previously said the lawsuit could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. And if the case reaches the Supreme Court — and if Brett Kavanaugh is sitting on that court — the decision probably won’t fall in Harvard’s favor, experts say, spelling the end for race-conscious admissions.
Khurana seemed to allude to the stakes of the situation near the end of his email.
“Higher education is at a unique inflection point,” he wrote. “We are living in a world where the central values of a liberal arts and sciences education — truth, reason, and civil disagreement — are being challenged.”
“As you contemplate how you will spend your time on campus this year, I hope you will consider what role you will play in creating the society you want to live in,” Khurana added.
