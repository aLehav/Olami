After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The upcoming senatorial contest between Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren and incumbent Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown is slated to be one of the most high-profile elections of 2012. The contested seat was held by the late Senator Ted Kennedy ’56 for almost five decades. Its Republican occupancy has been both a point of immense pride for the regional GOP and a thorn in the side of Massachusetts Democrats. Furthermore, Brown’s high level of Wall Street support and Warren’s decidedly anti-corporate message have propelled the contest to center-stage nationally.
The election’s highprofile nature has led to predictions that it will be seriously affected by super PACs, third-party organizations bankrolled largely by wealthy donors with no restrictions on spending. As a result, the Brown and Warren campaigns have engaged in talks with the intention of limiting super PAC spending in support of their candidacies.  The discussions have faltered because the campaigns could not agree on a reliable set of punishments to deter breaches of the agreement. Experts have speculated that it will be difficult for candidates’ campaigns to control the activities of groups that they are legally forbidden from coordinating with in the first place, suggesting that their attempts to do so are meaningless political posturing. Despite these challenges, the goal of undermining super PACs is a good one. Although the roadblocks are many, experts, candidates, and legislators ought to continue to find ways to prevent super PACS from harming the electoral process.
There was certainly no dearth of political advertisement prior to the recent advent of super PACs. Quite to the contrary, the detrimental effect of money in politics motivated legislators to enact campaign finance reform at various points throughout the past sixty years. Furthermore, it seems highly unlikely that anyone prior to the birth of the super PAC felt the rich had unduly small influence on government. Unfortunately, rather than empower voters to select their candidates more wisely, the influx of advertising from super PACs is likely to create campaign inflation, raising the minimum amount of cash support with which it is possible to wage a campaign and giving a leg up to any candidate with rich friends. Such an arms race will not add any value to the political process.
This inflation will further render insignificant the kind of small individual contributions that are at the heart of grassroots fundraising. If a single billionaire can, as we’ve seen with the Gingrich campaign, keep a politician in a race that he otherwise would have been forced to leave, then an average person’s $20 contribution is rendered virtually meaningless. Groups and individuals ought to be able to financially support candidacies they believe in, but a small group of plutocrats should not be allowed to commandeer the helm of our democracy.
In addition to the super PAC’s ability to hand disproportionate political influence to the extremely wealthy, the complete saturation of the media market around election time is likely to leave an even greater portion of the electorate frustrated with the democratic process. Should the Brown and Warren campaigns be unable to successfully limit third-party spending, it’s likely that political ads will dominate local airwaves to a far greater extent than we’ve seen in recent years. Election season should be a time for excitement and passion, not annoyance and frustration.
Regardless of whether Warren and Brown’s attempt to limit the influence of super PACs was motivated by public relations concerns or genuine worry for the state of our democracy, we hope to see more serious attempts of this nature in the future. The only people who stand to gain from super PACs are the extremely wealthy and unpopular politicians with rich friends.

The extensive media coverage given to violence in Mexico suggests that the country is the main battleground in the struggle between governments and the drug trade. Meanwhile, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica are more frequently associated with tourism or bananas than with cocaine and cartels. However, in actuality, Central America is more center stage for drug business than Mexico. If it is to have any hope of winning the war on drugs, the United States must provide extensive financial support to the governments of Central America that so desperately need it.
Almost all cocaine comes from the Andean nations of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, and the largest consumer of the powder is the United States. The countries that lie between the two regions are, by accident of geography and force of the market, a pathway for the illegal substance flowing from south to north. Mexico and Colombia have traditionally served as the main centers of operation for drug trafficking. However, since they have fought back against the drug industry, the cartels that control cocaine markets have recently begun to shift their attention to a more vulnerable target, Central America.
An understanding of historical context is necessary to appreciate why the region needs financial assistance. Three decades ago, Central  America was one of the last battlegrounds of the Cold War. In the name of fighting communism, the United   States attempted to overthrow democratically elected left-wing governments as it actively bolstered right-wing military dictatorships. This extensive warfare left a culture of violence and a series of democratic, but highly corrupt, regimes unable to spur development. Persistently, high crime eats away at the region’s societies; Honduras, El  Salvador, and Guatemala have some of the highest murder rates in the world, and the numbers only get worse with each passing year. The region’s social indicators rank among the world’s most dismal. To provide just one example of how impoverished these nations are, Guatemala actually suffered a famine two years ago that left 500 dead.
The drug cartels have swept into a place where lawlessness is already endemic, offering large numbers of hungry, uneducated youths a living in exchange for carrying out dirty business. Already, 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the U.S. passes in transit through Guatemala. The police forces of the isthmus have fought back valiantly—each year, operating on shoestring budgets that barely total a combined $4 billion, they capture 100 tons of cocaine. Mexico, where thousands have died in the conflict between the army and cartels, barely captures a third of that. But 200 tons of cocaine still slip through Central American countries each year, most of which end up in the U.S., becoming America’s problem.
To solve this problem, the United States needs to work with the governments of Central America. It has taken some steps in the right direction. Last year, Secretary of State Clinton pledged $300 million to bolster security in the region. While a positive gesture, this amount is far less than the $1.3 billion the Clinton administration spent to fight the cocaine trade in Colombia a decade ago. The situation in Central America today is at least as dire as that in Colombia in the 2000s. And, to be realistic, the current aid to Central  America is a negligible amount of money viewed in terms of total federal spending. Pumping a billion dollars into the region would hardly register in the Treasury’s books, but it could, if used well, create dramatic change for the better. It would be a shame not to extend a helping hand when doing so would cost so little.
In addition, the U.S. should take a long-term view, and not merely provide aid for security. Although cartels can be fought violently, the smartest way to beat them is to address the systemic poverty that allows them to grow. By funding education and health care in the region, the U.S. would, in the long run, deny cartels their easy access to manpower and create good will among Central American people.
A generation ago, the United States hurt Central America by trying to do too much. Ironically, today it may hurt the region by not doing enough. Hopefully, the U.S. government will recognize that the desperate situation in the isthmus requires urgent action. By addressing the cocaine trade at its root, the U.S. can both stem the flow of illegal drugs to American cities and aid developing countries.

The United Nations estimates that there are 200 million “missing” women in the world today, and by “missing,” the UN means they are dead. With the advent of abortion on demand, the modern world has encouraged parents around the world to use violence against their own children in order to achieve what they want. In some nations, even if the mother disagrees, the government takes the liberty of killing her children for her. While abortion proponents argue that abortion is an issue of women’s rights and empowerment, in reality it is nothing less than the deadliest weapon of gender discrimination on a global level.
Many blame the mass sex-selective abortions on specific policies and “backwards” traditions within specific nations and cultures. However, American Enterprise Institute scholar Nicholas Eberstadt found that the growing number of “missing” women couldn’t be explained by specific cultures or government policies alone. To measure the effect of sex-selective abortions, Eberstadt examined the sex ratio at birth for each nation. Naturally, the sex ratio at birth should fall between 103 to 106 boys for every 100 girls, and child sex ratios are correlated positively with education, income and urbanization. In large portions of China and India, the sex ratio is higher than 120 and increasing as the nations continue to develop and globalize, but the problem isn’t unique to the two Asian giants. Other nations with biologically impossible sex ratios include Austria, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Puerto Rico, Georgia, and Turkey among many others. In total, half of the world’s population lives in countries with unnaturally high sex ratios, representing nearly every one of the world’s major cultures and religions, from Buddhism to Christianity. The “missing” girl phenomenon is not a region-specific problem or statistical fluke. It is a global war on girls, driven by abortion on demand.
Unfortunately for women around the world, the progressive movement remains willing to tolerate gendercide as the collateral damage of their promotion of abortion. In response to the global war against girls, Human Rights Watch wrote, “regulating abortion may be ok but not to avoid sex-selection.” Planned Parenthood has opposed legislation aimed at limiting sex- and race-selective abortions. Liberal publication The American Prospect stated that no one should seek to stop parents from routinely aborting their female children, defending their claim with the assertion that “sometimes, freedom means we have to live with the possibility of icky things.” Genocide is not something that one lives with as a free person; it is a direct attack on freedom and, more importantly, humanity
If this remains the stance of the progressive movement, then it remains a movement committed to the defense of gendercide and the destruction of freedom. Liberals cannot attempt to empower women if they believe that baby girls are property to be kept or disposed of as parents or governments see fit. If the aborted infants were merely a few insignificant cells, then there wouldn’t be any missing women (and men) in the world today, but reality shows otherwise. The sex ratio at birth statistics demonstrate clearly that more women should be alive today but aren’t. They were sentenced to death because they were unwanted, and to permit abortions just because a child is unwanted or unintended is to permit Social Darwinism on an entirely new level. As some pro-abortion activists have argued, an unintended pregnancy is like a robber entering a home through an open window. However, unlike a robber entering a home, the infant in the womb does not have a strict moral duty not to enter the womb; to the contrary, the womb is her home, although she had no say in the matter. She and her mother are both equal persons in whom the value of life is to be respected and realized. Any direct action with the intention of ending either life is an affront to basic goodness and flagrant violation of their rights as human persons.
The final exhibit within the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington contrasts the brave few who fought the genocide promoted by the Nazi regime with the millions of Europeans who stood by and did nothing. The implication is clear: we as human beings have a moral obligation to respect and protect the life and dignity of all of our fellow human beings. For this reason, Harvard Right to Life is joining thousands of others at the March for Life in Washington, D.C. today. They are fighting on the front line of the global war against girls, to ensure that millions of girls and boys never go “missing” again. When millions of babies are murdered and the very existence of the female sex becomes conditional, all other issues in American politics pale in comparison. On the 39th anniversary of Roe v. Wade which we marked yesterday, the battle lines between life and death couldn’t be clearer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The art of writing includes several proven ways to boost both erudition and superfluous complexity.  One is to use the phrase, “erudition and superfluous complexity.”  Another is to reference Immanuel Kant.  So, in the interest of erudition and superfluous complexity, Kant seems as good a place as any at which to start.
Of Immanuel Kant’s diverse arsenal of tools, tidbits, and treatises, his “categorical imperative” remains perhaps the most famous, and infamous.  The first formulation of that “imperative” runs: “Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.”  From within that somewhat verbose tangle (a bit of a Golden-Rule rehash), comes a plainly stated corollary: what is just is universally just.  Is that true?  In most cases, at least, it should be.
Here is one case.  The Occupy movement, the populist outcry du jour (or de l'année, or something; we’ll see) speaks to an ever-broadening bevy of concerns and causes.  Cries of “wealth inequality” ring out, loud and strident.  But another strain, quieter but real, chirps firmly amid the cacophony.  “They have consistently outsourced labor,” Occupy Wall Street’s N.Y. General Assembly says of its corporate foes.  Closer to home, Occupy Harvard sees “injustice in Harvard’s adoption of corporate efficiency measures such as job outsourcing.”  And yet, simultaneously, we have this statement, from Occupy Wall Street: “Ending wealth inequality is our one demand.”  An incongruity because it begs the question—whose wealth inequality?
Now, to tie together Kant, Occupiers, and Inequality into two syllogistic points. If excessive wealth inequality—especially artificially constructed wealth inequality—is unjust, then it ought to be unjust wherever it exists.  Any Occupy enthusiast, whether based in Zuccotti Park or a Harvard Yard tent, should agree to that. And second, accepting the first statement, the Occupy movement should oppose the poverty of an Indonesian family as much as it should that of a New Yorker or a Kansan.  Instead, what is Occupy’s proposed solution for that family’s poverty?  Take away its jobs and stop sending it money.
When it comes to Americans themselves, free trade boosts standards of living for consumers (especially crucial for the famed ninety-nine percent), staves off an artificially expensive dollar (instead of hoarding dollars domestically and poisoning exports), and encourages reciprocal tariff lowering (see the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, for proof by contradiction); even free trade’s “losers” (having lost both the money and the nomenclature battles) can be more than compensated (at least for the former defeat).
Now let’s take a look at the other side, the foreign, outsourced-to half of the globalization picture.  First, we can turn to numbers.  In America, the official poverty line stands at $22,350 per year for a family of four, with 46.2 million people qualifying.  But the World Bank places the global poverty rate at about $457 per year, with 1.4 billion people qualifying in 2008.  That does not mean the developed world should tax nearly all of its own wealth to be sent overseas; it does mean the developed world should remain an engine of growth, building its economies along with those less advantaged.  And it does provide some perspective on where true inequity lies.
Consistently, freer trade begets more development and less poverty.  According to the International Monetary Fund, “On average, those developing countries that lowered tariffs sharply in the 1980s grew more quickly in the 1990s than those that did not.”  Among “new globalizers,” relatively recent free-traders, “the number of people in absolute poverty declined by over 120 million (14 percent) between 1993 and 1998.”  As a result, perhaps most tellingly, a National Bureau of Economic Research study reports that “all effects considered, more globalization has meant less world inequality.”  With global trade, money has flowed from wealthy to poor, not vice versa.
That leaves one concern, the dark, spoiling cloud of exploitation: outsourcing’s labor practices coerce hopeless peoples; smoggy photos confirm the wince of intuition.  But there is a price on that smog and those poor conditions (a negative salary, of sorts), a price the developing world, unlike the rest, accepts in exchange for higher wages.  As economist Paul Krugman (The1997 version of Paul Krugman, a now-extinct creature) put it, “The only reason developing countries have been able to compete with those industries is their ability to offer employers cheap labor. Deny them that ability, and you might well deny them the prospect of continuing industrial growth.”  The better the conditions—the “fairer” the wages—the more inequality abroad.  Assuaged Western consciences paid for in poverty.
Occupy Wall Street and its tentacles spread out this autumn and winter amidst an autumnal waning of collective hope; and yet they gave rise to a host of hopes, hoping to coalesce.  He hopes she hopes they hope; a babbling cacophony.  I hope for something simple.  I hope that the movement can prove unselfish, that it can eschew a myopic morality.  But, for all our hope, I worry, and these times, our times, remain worrisome.

Eric R. Brewster ’14 and Avery A. Leonard ’14 fought off drooping eyelids and the urge to sleep last week as they held a phone conversation that lasted for 46 hours, 12 minutes, 52 seconds, and 228 milliseconds—potentially setting a new world record.
The performance art installation was the premiere creation of the Harvard Generalist, a new student arts cooperative.
Stage Manager Ginny C. Fahs ’14 said that the performance was much like an athletic competition because it required extreme endurance from Leonard and Brewster.
“This explored deterioration—physical, mental, and emotional,” Fahs said. “Because of that deterioration, the balance between art and sport was explored.”
Brewster and Leonard  had to follow a strict set of rules outlined by the Guinness Book of World Records. Brewster and Leonard were allowed five minutes of break for every hour spent on the phone. In addition, Speakers could not use prompts or lists of talking points in an effort to keep conversation “natural,” and were not allowed to remain silent for more than ten seconds.
The conversation has yet to be officially declared a new world record, however. In the coming weeks Guinness will review the two-day conversation, which was filmed in its entirety, to verify that the performers abided by Guinness’s regulations.
At least two “stewards”—other members of the Generalist—kept watch over the performers at all times, ensuring that they stayed awake and were coherent. Two official timekeepers were also present to monitor the call’s length.
“For the first eight hours I was here, they were very excited and had original topics,” timekeeper Christian M. Trippe said. “Now you can see their fatigue, and they’re ready to sleep. You could see them rambling as time progressed.”
The phone call took place in two separate spaces: the Adams Pool Theater and a small room off of the theater which featured a bed of pillows. The “pillow room” was intended as a stark contrast to the bareness of the Adams Pool Theatre.
The room was inspired by “the theme of threats and the question of what would be a threat,” Fahs said.
Generalist members said the temptation to sleep and to read aloud in lieu of genuine conversation posed the biggest threats to the performers. Therefore, the room was filled with pillows, books, and blankets.
The Generalist encouraged spectator participation. Audience members engaged in activities such as decorating the space, braiding Leonard’s hair, massaging Brewster’s feet, and playing Bananagrams and poker with Brewster and Leonard.
“What we wanted was to focus on was having the audience interact with them to hopefully, verbally and physically, inspire new topics,” said Mariel N. Pettee ’14, the director and set designer. “These two people weren’t allowed to read words so the audience was the liaison to the body of knowledge they didn’t have access to.”

This past week University President Drew G. Faust travelled to Mumbai and Delhi, visiting schools and strengthening Harvard’s ties with India.
During this visit, Faust’s first time in India, the president has divided her time between meeting with alumni and making the case for liberal arts education.
In a speech at the University of Mumbai, Faust said that though technology has and will continue to play a crucial role in India’s recent economic rise, a strong background in the liberal arts enables stronger international business relations.
“Connectivity and mobility do not necessarily confer understanding. The world is in one sense, flatter, but it is also many-featured and complex,” Faust said, referring to New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman’s book “The World is Flat.”
“Our aim at Harvard is to give students the tools needed to navigate a world that is flat and not flat—the tools needed to adjust to the circumstances of life, however surprising they may be” she continued.
Faust’s speech drew on India’s history and work by leading Indian academics. She quoted figures such as Jawaharlal Nehru, free India’s first prime minister, and Harvard professor Homi K. Bhabha, a leading thinker in post-colonial studies.
Prior to the speech, students from the University of Mumbai welcomed Faust with a performance of the school’s anthem, according to Harvard Magazine. Vice chancellor Rajan Welukar said that Faust’s visit was “the happiest day in the history of the University of Mumbai.”
According to Harvard Magazine, Faust spent time at Mumbai’s Harvard Club chatting with alumni of Harvard’s various schools. Faust also toured the Harvard’s South Asia Initiative’s center and an all-girls high school.
In recent years Harvard has paid particular attention to India. In 2003, Harvard created the South Asia Initiative, which seeks to encourage academic research in regional issues.
In the past few years, Harvard has also seen a considerable increase in monetary gifts from international, and particularly Indian, donors. In 2010, the University received more than $65 million from three Indian donors—N. R. Narayana Murthy, Tata Trusts and Companies, and Anand G. Mahindra ’77.
In November, Siddhartha Yog, a graduate of the Business School and founder and partner of The Xander Group Inc., donated $11 million to establish two new professorships and an intellectual entrepreneurship fund, and to support fellowships and financial aid.

After a two-week long tug of war, Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Scott Brown failed to reach an agreement to ban third-party advertising in the race for U.S. Senate in a meeting Friday.
Representatives of the Warren campaign walked away from the half-hour long meeting dissatisfied with the terms offered by Brown aides, according to Warren spokesperson Alethea Harney.
Ultimately the two camps could not agree on two issues: how to monitor spending on internet ads, and how to deal with so-called “sham” advertisements that masquerade as endorsements.
“The proposal he has put forward still includes loopholes that Karl Rove could drive a tank through,” Warren said in a statement, referring to American Crossroads, the conservative “super PAC” led by former presidential advisor Karl Rove.
Since December, Crossroads GPS, an independent political organization affiliated with American Crossroads, has sponsored two advertisements attacking Warren.
After the unsuccessful meeting, the Brown campaign issued its own statement expressing frustration and alleging that Warren is reluctant to move beyond rhetoric to achieve real action.
“She claims that she wants to move beyond rhetoric, but so far she has offered nothing but talk and excuses,” Brown campaign manager Jim Barnett wrote.
Prior to Friday’s meeting, Harvard professors called the efforts on both sides to reach a “truce” little more than political posturing.
“The public does not like [super PACs],” Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer David C. King said before the meeting. “So it’s easy for the campaigns to distance from them. This is complete nonsense. It’s all about trying to shape the impression of what is happening.”
Even if the two candidates had reached an agreement, the laws surrounding third-party organizations would not have allowed for any real enforcement, professors said.
Political action committees, or “PACs,” as they are known, enable donors to bypass campaign finance restrictions due to a recent Supreme Court ruling.
In the 2010 Citizens United case, the Court ruled that the government cannot restrict the political spending of independent organizations.
Though the organizations vary in scope and purpose, the 2010 Citizens United case has given rise to huge, money-rich political organizations like American Crossroads that have attracted attention nationally and in Massachusetts.
In her statement, Warren said she is still confident both camps can reach an agreement. No plans have been made for another meeting Harney said, but she added that the campaigns hope to continue a dialogue to iron out the loopholes.
Though the election is months away, Warren and Brown have been engaged in a fierce fight for the U.S. Senate seat currently occupied by Brown since Warren announced her candidacy in September.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Library system will seek to reduce the size of its approximately 930 person workforce as part of the ongoing restructuring of the world’s largest academic library, according to a transcript of remarks made by Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton at one of three town hall meetings held Thursday.
“The new organizational design has not yet been approved, but it is certain that it will be different from the current one,” said Shenton at one of the town hall meetings. “A key change: the Library workforce will be smaller than it is now.”
The University is considering both voluntary and involuntary options to reduce staff, but prefers voluntary methods, Shenton said. While Harvard has laid off employees in the past, the University has at times also offered some staff voluntary early retirement packages or waited for attrition to reduce staff.
University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60 told The Crimson in the fall that the restructuring would aim to make the libraries more efficient.
“We are consolidating the libraries in a way that will save money, and that money saved will be plowed back into acquisitions and expanded services,” Darnton said at the time. “It will make the library much stronger.”
After the University consolidates multiple libraries, some positions will be redundant.
Staff reductions will be necessary due to this overlap, according to a University spokesperson.
“There are opportunities to become a more effective and more efficient organization,” the spokesperson said. “Many of the changes will come in areas where there are currently duplicate efforts.”
Prior to Thursday’s meetings, rumors and speculation circulated amongst library employees about the implications of the library restructuring.
“All of Harvard library staff have just effectively been fired,” read one tweet that circulated on Thursday after the first town hall had begun.
Others suggested that the restructuring would require that all library employees reapply to keep their current positions.
The University strongly refuted this statement, but recommended that all employees file an Employee Profile “to state job preferences, to articulate skills and to provide a resume.”
Still, library officials left many other questions unanswered, according to Director of Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers Bill Jaeger.
“There were vague references made to reductions in the size of the staff,” said Jaeger. “Despite persistent questions from the audience the [library] leaders were not able or willing to provide anything more specific than that.”
Though Jaeger said that he does not see the rationale for staff cuts, he recommended that the University employ “more enlightened” voluntary methods if staff is to be reduced.
“Our contract with the University requires union–management consultation when a department is considering [such changes],” Jaeger said. “We’re pretty confident that as this goes forward we’ll continue to hear from them.”
The staff reduction comes as part of a larger reorganization of library personnel that will be presented for approval next week to the Library Board, the body overseeing the library’s long-term transformation.
The Board is then responsible for presenting the plan to University President Drew G. Faust.
The University chose to share the decision to reduce staff despite the lack of the details to encourage a dialogue between Library officials and employees, according to a University spokesperson.
Pending the plan’s acceptance, more detailed explanations of the organizational changes will be revealed during library staff meetings in February.

Harvard administrators removed the last vestiges of the Occupy Harvard encampment from Harvard Yard on Jan. 13. Administrators and Cambridge police cited potential safety hazards as reason to dismantle the weather-proof dome and information tent—the only structures remaining after the protest movement decamped in December.
On its website, Occupy Harvard called administrators’ decision to dismantle the dome “a direct reversal of their previously stated commitment to ensure free speech in Harvard Yard.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal said that safety was the motivation behind the seizure of the dome and information tent.
That day, winds reaching 45 miles per hour had caused the dome to move several feet and collapsed the tent, Neal said in an email, adding that the dome nearly struck a passerby.
Derin Korman, a teaching fellow in Visual and Environmental Studies and Occupy Harvard supporter, said that he and other protesters removed the tarp covering the dome after the structure was uprooted. Protesters then transported the tarp and the other loose objects kept in the dome to Phillips Brooks House for storage.
On its website, the Occupy Harvard group stated that protesters understood from a conversation with a grounds manager that they could keep the dome in the Yard as long as it was secured. They held an emergency general assembly in which they made plans to affix the dome to the ground.
But Director of Facilities Management and Operations Zachary M. Gingo and Associate Dean for Physical Resources and Planning Michael N. Lichten then approached the protesters and told them to remove the dome, Korman said.
Lichten declined to comment at the time.
When the protesters refused to comply, Harvard employees disassembled and seized the dome. On its website, Occupy Harvard claimed that the workers were assisted by Cambridge police.
On that same day, the University had received a letter from the Cambridge Historical Commission claiming that the geodesic dome’s presence put Harvard in violation of a code forbidding structures erected on a historical site without a permit.
Harvard is responsible, the letter stated, for making sure that any group acting on University property adheres to local regulations.
When members of the commission first saw the dome, they believed it would be temporary, according to Charles M. Sullivan, the executive director of the Historical Commission, a department of the city of Cambridge.
But the dome proved to have more staying power than the Historical Commission estimated.
“When it was still there over the holidays, we felt it was important to bring Harvard’s attention to the fact that Harvard Yard is a historic district,” Sullivan said.
Occupy Harvard protesters said they were unaware of the regulation before the commission sent its letter to Harvard.
Neal wrote that the University will return the pieces of the dome once Occupy Harvard representatives make arrangements to retrieve them. Harvard has forbidden the protesters from erecting the dome on University property again, he said, but administrators plan to work with the protesters to find a new location for their information table.
With or without a physical occupation in the Yard, members of the movement said they will continue to make their presence known on campus.
“We are still here,” Korman said. “We will continue in various forms. It is definitely not the end, not nearly so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two sisters, one in pink and one in purple, held a sign twice their size as cars passed by in Harvard Square. The poster showed two monkeys in a cage, holding each other tight, and a slogan demanding an end to animal testing.
“This is what they do to animals in laboratories,” their mother explained to the girls.
The family was participating in a protest against Harvard laboratories on Sunday. Other protesters held similar signs in Southborough, where Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate Research Center is located.
They claimed that negligence on the part of Harvard-affiliated researchers at multiple facilities has caused the deaths of a total of nine animals in the past two years. As a result, the protesters are asking the government to suspend animal testing at Harvard.
NEPRC was recently cited by the United States Department of Agriculture for multiple violations of the Animal Welfare Act—most recently, the October death of a non-human primate. The animal died soon after escaping from its cage, being captured with a net by NEPRC staff, and undergoing an imaging procedure.
The report also cited unsuitable living conditions for non-human primates, noting signs of psychological distress among some primates like hair loss and unusual behavior.
A USDA citation can result in a warning letter to the offending institution or a fine of up to $10,000.
The Medical School offered a statement but repeatedly declined to answer additional questions for this article.
The statement said that Medical School researchers are working to “strengthen their processes” and ensure that they are compliant with animal treatment laws.
In the meantime, animal rights activists question not only the Medical School’s recent track record but also the necessity of some animals as test subjects at all.
AN UNCLEAN RECORD
In the last two years, a total of three non-human primates have died at NEPRC. In addition to the escapee, one animal suffered an anesthesia overdose which led to kidney failure, according to the USDA. The primate was euthanized.
For some protesters, the third death epitomizes mistreatment of animals at Harvard research labs.
On the morning of June 9, 2010, NEPRC personnel transferred non-human primates from their cage unit to a temporary one so that their permanent cages could be cleaned. During the routine cleaning, the cages were sanitized in a mechanical washer with water that reached up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit.
Following the cleaning that day, researchers found a dead animal on the floor of one of the cages.
NEPRC staff immediately performed a necropsy on the primate and found that it was dead before entering the washer, according to a statement from the Medical School. An inspection report by the USDA confirmed their findings.
The report stated that personnel failed to comply with multiple procedures. It claimed that no one noticed that the animal was behaving abnormally during the morning health check nor that the primate was “still inside the dirty quad cage unit when it was put inside the mechanical cage washer.”
The incident prompted Elizabeth Goldentyer, the eastern regional director of the USDA, to send a warning letter to the Medical School in
October 2010.
In a statement released after the incident, the Medical School said that it would take “immediate actions” to ensure that NEPRC employees are “fully trained and strictly comply with protocols to help ensure the health, well being, and safety of all [non-human primates].”
ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL
In addition to the three primates, deaths at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the McLean Hospital Corporation, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—all affiliated with Harvard but registered separately with the USDA—bring the total number of animal deaths in the past two years at Harvard-affiliated institutions to nine.
“Nine animal deaths is a significant number,” USDA spokesperson David Sacks wrote in an email.
Still, Sacks noted that “numbers don’t always give the clearest picture.”
In January 2009, a dog at Brigham and Women’s Hospital died due to an anesthesia overdose, according a USDA report.
That September, a USDA inspection team found a sheep at the hospital suffering from “anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing and signs of upper airway infection.” Notified of the sheep’s condition, hospital staff started treatment, but the sheep died the following day.
Afterward, the staff received training to prevent additional animal deaths.
But in the summer of 2010, two rabbits undergoing a short procedure at the facility died after receiving a dosage of anesthesia only approved by a veterinarian for “terminal procedures,” according a USDA report. All staff members received further training following the incident, the USDA said. There have been no additional deaths at the hospital.
Last summer, a goat under the care of FAS researchers died while recovering from an operation. A USDA report stated that researchers misread the dose for the goat’s anesthesia and administered four times the recommended amount. Personnel received additional training, and the report stated that no more incidents occurred.
“You begin to see a pattern of negligence and disregard for the animals,” said Michael Budkie, executive director of Stop Animal Exploitation Now, an organization that focuses on preventing abuse of laboratory animals. Budkie helped organize Sunday’s protest against Harvard’s research facilities.
“If there had been one incident, you say, ‘Okay, this could possibly be an accident,’” Budkie said. “But when someone starts to show a pattern of repeated incidents, that’s when you start seeing major consequences.”
‘IT’S A BUSINESS’
Budkie and others focused on research ethics have said that the Medical School’s research license should be revoked in order to save the animals and taxpayer dollars.
John J. Pippin ’71, the director of academic affairs for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, wrote a letter asking the USDA to “consider suspending research activities at both Harvard Medical School and Harvard University.”
“Harvard continues to put animals at risk and even kill them while benefitting from hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding,” Pippin wrote.
His organization scored Ivy League institutions on the number and severity of violation of the Animal Welfare Act in their laboratories since 2008. It ranked the University of Pennsylvania as the worst offender, followed by Princeton and Yale, then Harvard.
Over the past three years, according to Pippin, Harvard has received $1.3 billion in funding for scientific research from the National Institutes of Health, a separate government agency.
In contrast, the USDA can issue a maximum fine of $10,000 per institution, according to Sacks, the USDA spokesperson.
“If the USDA did everything they could possibly do, they couldn’t really hurt Harvard,” Budkie said. “The entities that they are regulating have become so large and so wealthy…it’s a business.”
NEXT STEPS
On its website, the NEPRC states that the animal research it conducts serves a variety of purposes, including creating drugs to treat cocaine addiction and developing gene therapy to further AIDS research.
But a December report released by the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit organization, said that recent scientific advances should make it possible to partially eliminate the use of chimpanzees, which are closely related to humans, as research subjects. The report recommended that NIH-funded experiments use chimpanzees only under “stringent conditions”—including an inability to ethically perform the research on people instead.
Pippin said that in light of the report, “We are on the cusp of a changing viewpoint of animal research. If it isn’t necessary to use chimpanzees, it isn’t necessary to use other non-human primates.”
The protesters that took to the streets on Sunday said they believed that scientific trends are on their side.
“If the University complex has had this many negligent deaths in this amount of time, there is clearly something very, very wrong,” Budkie said. “The public needs to be skeptical of what’s going on here.”
Pippin said that technology is paving a new path for research that does not include animals. Tissue engineering, stem cell research, and the administration of “micro-doses” of drugs to humans can all serve as alternatives to animal research, he said.
“I’ve been an animal researcher. I know the deal,” Pippin said. “These people who have been arguing against the use of chimpanzees all these years were right.”

Assistant football coaches Kris Barber, Joe M. Conlin, and A. Dwayne Wilmot will leave Harvard for positions at Yale, Harvard football head coach Tim Murphy announced to players in an email Sunday.
All three were allegedly lured away by Tony Reno—the secondary and special teams coach for Harvard during the 2011 season—who was hired as Yale’s next head football coach two weeks ago.
“Obviously this is an [unusual] if not unprecedented situation,” Murphy wrote in an email. “Especially in the same league with a historic rival. The bottom line is that Yale made them very lucrative offers financially along with titles.”
Barber had been the wide receivers coach, Conlin led the offensive line, and Wilmot served as the coach of the defensive line.
All three were members of the coaching staff for only one year.
“It came as a little bit of a surprise,” defensive tackle Jack J. Dittmer ’14 said. “You hate to see a coach go, but you have to accept it. It’s the nature of college football.”
Harvard has suffered serious losses in coaching staff in the past year.
Last year, Harvard lost four assistant coaches to a variety of posts in college and professional football.
“I wasn’t surprised coaches were leaving,” said offensive lineman Will L. Whitman ’15. “But I was surprised that that many coaches were leaving and, not only that, but that they were going to Yale.”
For Barber, the move might be explained by the fact that he was a quarterback at Yale for three years before graduating in 1997.
“Learning that Coach Reno got the head coaching job, I figured a few of our coaches would go with him,” wideout Matt S. Brown ’14 said. “Coach Barber was a Yale player, so I definitely thought that was a possibility.”
The new developments will add a twist to one of the most storied rivalries in college football.
“It’s going to up it from a rivalry to a personal game,” Whitman said. “We will want to beat them real bad next year.”
Receiver Seitu L. Smith III ’15, who was recruited by Reno and coached by Barber, rationalized the coaches’ decision.
“They got opportunities they couldn’t resist,” Smith said. “They’re doing what’s better for them and their families. You can’t be upset about that.”
In a text message to players, Conlin explained his decision similarly. According to one player, Conlin said that he was offered a better title and more money from Yale.
Conlin also insisted that he was not completely decided.
According to the player, Conlin said that if he chooses to stay, it would be out of love for his Harvard players.
Conlin wrote in an email that he has not signed a contract with Yale but declined to comment further.
Whitman said that the team had jokingly forecasted the move.
“We actually were joking around that because [Conlin] was such a good coach, he wouldn’t last long,” Whitman said.
Wilmot declined to comment and Barber could not be reached for comment.
The trio of departures represents another surprise in a nascent but already eventful offseason.
Following the Crimson’s 9-1 season, rumors swirled that Penn State was interested in Murphy to fill the seat left by coach Joe Paterno.
While those rumors never came to fruition, four out of nine coaches have since departed.

As the 2012 Republican presidential contest unfolds, Romney’s position as the front-runner has been called into question following Newt Gingrich’s win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.
Until now, pundits have all but crowned Romney the front-runner after he placed second in the Iowa caucuses and won the New Hampshire primary. According to a Gallup poll released earlier this month, six in ten likely voters believe Romney will be the Republican nominee.
Professor at the Harvard Kennedy School Matthew A. Baum said he believes that despite Romney’s perceived status as the likely nominee, conservatives are searching for a candidate that presents a challenge.
“I think the conservative and traditional-values wing of the Republican party has been very dissatisfied with Romney,” Baum said. “There’s been a desire to find an alternative to Romney, and Gingrich has fired up the base very effectively.”
With Gingrich gaining traction in the polls, Romney’s campaign has suffered a blow.
Elaine C. Kamarck, lecturer at the Kennedy School and former advisor to Al Gore ’69, said she was not surprised that Gingrich won the South Carolina primary.
“South Carolina was always going to be a good state for him and he knew it,” Kamarck said. “He won because he had really strong support among evangelicals. That was one state where Romney’s Mormonism might really matter.”
According to Kamarck, Gingrich’s win indicates that there are “severe doubts about Romney’s conservative credentials” among Republicans.
“Everything that has been said about Romney earlier this year has played out—that is, that he’s going to have a hard time rallying the conservative base,” she said.
Baum noted that despite Gingrich’s win in South Carolina, Romney will likely fare well in future state contests.
“We are told that Romney has a much better ground-game across the country and has staff in most of the major primary states,” Baum said. “Gingrich is much less situated right now to run a state-by-state-by-state campaign.”
Although the Republican nomination race has become increasingly tense in recent weeks, Kevin R. Palmer ’12 said he believes the damage will not prevent Romney from winning in November’s general election.
“I think it will be to the benefit of the party,” Palmer said. “The prolonged battle between [Barack] Obama and [Hillary] Clinton made Obama a better candidate in November 2008. Hopefully the remaining four candidates can stay focused on the issues.”
Aditi Ghai ’14, who is supporting Romney and has conducted fieldwork for his campaign in New Hampshire, said that she has noticed that students on campus are paying attention to the Republican race.
Ghai said that most students have not been involved in campaigning, but she believes that will change in the general election.
“I think this race is kind of a big deal,” Ghai said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team overcame flying dead fish and a third-period deficit to tie No. 9 Cornell, 2-2, Saturday night in front of a sold-out crowd at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y.
Senior forward Alex Killorn scored the game-tying goal with 7:43 left in the historic rivalry’s second meeting of the season. After receiving the puck from junior Marshall Everson, Colin Blackwell passed to Killorn, who was alone in the slot. The senior’s goal gave the Crimson (4-6-8, 3-4-6 ECAC) its fourth draw in six games.
“[Cornell is] always tough, especially at home,” said assistant captain and forward Daniel Moriarty. “Getting down early is never good, but it showed a lot of character in us battling back like that.”
The game went into overtime, but Harvard wasn’t able to convert on its four shots—the only ones in the extra period—and extended its school record for ties in a single season.
“Yesterday was one of our better games in terms of playing a full 60 minutes,” junior forward David Valek said. “That was definitely a step forward in turning these ties into wins.”
The Big Red (11-4-4, 8-1-3) was the first on the board when Joel Lowry’s shot from the left side beat Crimson freshman goalie Stephen Michalek nine minutes into the first period. The goal, which deflected off a defender’s stick, was assisted by defensemen Mathieu Brisson and captain Keir Ross.
Harvard knotted the score at one with a power-play goal by Everson, who redirected junior Danny Biega’s shot past the Big Red netminder at the 18:15 mark. It also marked the eighth time in the Crimson’s last nine games in which it scored on its first power play of the game.
With a goal and an assist, Everson completed his third straight two-point game.
“Marshall’s played hard for us all year, and he’s been rewarded in the last couple games with big goals,” Moriarty said.
Throughout the second period, Harvard had its chances to score, including a Blackwell shot that clanged off the crossbar. The Crimson also failed to convert on two consecutive power plays.
Thwarting many of Harvard’s scoring chances, Big Red goalie Andy Iles was rock-solid in net, saving 31 Crimson shots, including 11 on the power play.
“Iles is obviously a great goalie,” Valek said. “He’s really fast moving side to side. I think he’s definitely one of the better goalies in the league.”
Blackwell had another good chance in the second, this time on the breakaway after Cornell freshman Joakim Ryan turned the puck over at the blue line. But the Crimson rookie’s backhand shot was stopped by the glove of Iles.
Soon after the second straight power play ended for Harvard, the Crimson was penalized for too many men on the ice.  Taking advantage of this mistake, Big Red freshman Ryan put a one-timer from Greg Miller past Michalek’s glove side midway through the second, putting Cornell up, 2-1.
After Harvard drew even in the third, it was able to gain momentum as the Big Red seemed to play more tentatively. But in the end, the Crimson could not snap Cornell’s nation-leading seven-game unbeaten streak.
Harvard had some more chances in the final minutes, but Iles again stepped up, saving 13 in the final frame. The Big Red goaltender stopped an open shot by Killorn at 1:23 and corralled a quick shot off the ensuing face-off from freshman Patrick McNally.
Junior Luke Greiner led the Crimson with 12 face-off wins, while Killorn led the team with eight shots in the game.
Throughout the contest, Harvard, which leads all Division I schools with a 34.7 percent success rate on the man-advantage, was able to convert only one of its five power-plays. But the team believes it wasn’t a matter of a problem in the power play.
“I think our power play overall did a pretty good job,” Valek said. “We just weren’t lucky enough to get one more. I think the opportunities were there, but unfortunately the goals didn’t come.”
Although the Crimson outshot the Big Red, 33-19, Harvard had to come back in this one to draw the strong Cornell squad.
“We’ve had a lot of close games this year, a lot of ties, which is encouraging in one aspect,” Moriarty said. “But on the other end of it, we want to come through and start winning the big games. So in order for us to do that we have to keep playing hard for 60, 65 minutes, and make the chances go our way with continued effort throughout the entire game.”

After two months without match play, the Harvard tennis team didn’t show any rust this weekend, putting on a nearly perfect display at the Harvard Winter Invite. The Crimson hosted Fordham and Marist from Friday through Sunday at the Murr Tennis Center, and Harvard won 22 out of 26 matches in singles play and 10 out of 12 doubles matches.
For the singles, freshman Henry Steer emerged as the tournament winner, going 3-0 on the weekend and dropping just six games in three matches. Fellow freshman Denis Nguyen earned a second-place finish in the tournament.
In doubles action, co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey MacMaster took first place, while the pairing of Andy and Denis Nguyen completed the clean sweep for Harvard with a second-place finish.
“It was a good way to start the season for sure,” said Harvard assistant coach Andrew Rueb ’95. “I think it’s all about building our skills as the season goes on, and we had a good start. The boys competed hard, and they’re getting a bit battle-tested for the next weekend.”
Steer led the charge with his first tournament win of the season. The rookie never looked to be in trouble throughout his three matches, finishing up with a perfect 3-0 weekend. In his first match, Steer steamrolled over Fordham’s Kuba Kowlaski, 6-1, 6-2, and followed up the next day with a victory (6-2, 6-1) against Marist’s Joseph Dube.
After two dominant performances, Steer capped off the weekend with a dominating win (6-0, 6-0) against Marist’s Joris Van Eck, losing the fewest games of any Crimson player during the weekend.
Meanwhile, Denis Nguyen claimed two decisive victories, including one come-from-behind win. Just as Steer had done in his first match, Nguyen easily defeated Marist’s Lorenzo Rossi, 6-2, 6-1.
His second match was not as easy, but Denis Nguyen prevailed in three sets. Against Van Eck, Nguyen dropped the first set, 6-1, before rallying back to blank his opponent in the second set. The freshman completed his comeback victory by claiming the third set, 6-1.
The two other freshmen who competed, Alex Steinroeder and Shaun Chaudhuri, also posted winning records on the weekend. Steinroeder opened up play by defeating Matt Himmelsbach of Marist, 6-3, 6-4, and then won in a tight battle against Rossi, 7-5, 6-3. In his first loss of the weekend, Kowalski edged out Steinroeder in two tiebreak sets, dropping Steinroeder’s record to 2-1.
Chaudhuri only played two matches and claimed victories in both, besting Marist’s Dalen Klassen and Fordham’s Srikar Alla by the same scoreline of 6-2, 6-2.
In his first appearance of the season, sophomore Christo Schultz claimed two three-set victories. Schultz grabbed the opening set, 6-4, in his first matchup, but then dropped the middle set by the same score. Despite the two close sets, Schultz lost only one game in the third set en route to a 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 win. In his second match, Schultz dropped the first, 6-4, before coming back in the next two sets, 6-2, 6-2.
“It’s great to have Christo’s energy, his doubles’ skills, and singles’ game,” Rueb said. “He’s played a lot of good tennis, and it’s great to have him back with the rest of the team performing at a high level.”
Senior Jonathan Pearlman also went 3-0 for the weekend, dropping just one set in his three matches. He defeated Van Eck, 7-5, 6-3, in his first match, and then was tested further in a 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 victory over Kowalski. For his third match, he comfortably won the first set, 6-2, before Himmelsbach retired earlier.
In doubles action, Felton and MacMaster started off their championship run with an easy 8-1 win over the duo of Rossi and Himmelsbach. The Crimson pair then followed that up with an 8-4 win over Kowlaski and Alla. Nguyen and Nguyen, the runners-up of the tournament, mirrored the performance, starting out with an 8-1 victory over Marist’s Billy Bishop and Van Eck and then capping off the weekend with an 8-4 win over Rossi and Himmelsbach.
“We came back from break right away, started with a good scrimmage at Dartmouth, and then here, a lot of guys are playing well, so I’m excited for the season,” Steer said.
His second singles match went to three sets, but he only dropped seven games in his other two matches.

The second annual Harvard Challenge proved to be less than a challenge for the Harvard track and field team, as the Crimson teamed up with Ancient Eight rival Brown to take down the Patriot League’s Army and Colgate in their first meet of the season.
The Harvard Challenge presents an unusual format, with two Ivy League rivals partnering up to take on a pair of Patriot League teams.  Just as last year, the Bears joined Harvard in welcoming the Mules and Raiders to Gordon Indoor Track.
And the Crimson had a lot to prove, as Brown narrowly edged victory out of Harvard’s hands last season at the Indoor Ivy Championships.
The Crimson got off to a flying start, claiming the top two spots in each of the first four events.
Freshman Danielle Barbian opened the meet with a win in the 60-meter dash, qualifying for the ECAC Championships with a time of 7.70 seconds. Barbian’s time was close to the school record, and classmate Ashley Ifeadike finished just behind her at 7.83 seconds. Barbian was one of seven individual performers and one relay team on the women’s side to post ECAC-qualifying times.
“This year we have a lot of depth,” co-captain Christine Reed said. “Every single event has multiple contenders to really compete well at Ivy League Championships…and to score points.”
Sophomore Morgan Kelly was outstretched by Colgate’s Chelsea Burns, losing by .02 seconds in the 3000-Meter.  But the sophomore’s time of 9:52.08 was well below the line to qualify her for the ECAC Championships.
Harvard’s 4x440 relay set the pace for the field, finishing eight seconds ahead of its closest competitors and three seconds below the ECAC-qualifying time.
In the field events, the Crimson took the top spots in all but one competition.
Junior Mary Hirst took home first place and an ECAC-qualifying height of 1.77 meters in the high jump, while her classmates Olivia Weeks and Ashtynn Baltimore placed first and second in the long jump, respectively, while also earning a spot in the ECAC Championships.
Shannon Watt completed an impressive showing from Harvard’s junior class, as the shot-putter also booked her place in the ECAC Championships with a throw of 13.74 meters.
“This year, more than ever, we expect to have most of our team qualify for the ECAC,” Reed said. “We have an amazing freshman class and a really talented group of upperclassmen.”
In the end, the Crimson took first place in total points and more than doubled Brown’s tally, sending an early message of intent to its Ancient Eight competition.
On the men’s side, the Harvard Challenge provided an opportunity for the team to ease back into competition and begin the season by gauging its fitness.
“This weekend was definitely a step in the right direction,” co-captain Brian Paison said. “These early season meets are a chance to get the rust off, but also make a statement in the league and against other competition. I think we did that.”
Senior Jonathan Meminger got Harvard off to the right start, taking first in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.02 seconds. Meminger did not finish there, taking first in the 200 meter with a time of 22.25 seconds.
Senior John Dingus followed with a first-place finish of his own in the 500-meter dash, registering a time of 1:04.71 and qualifying for the IC4A Championships, and freshman Connor Reck notched his first collegiate victory in the 1000-meter.
The Harvard Challenge displayed a typically dominant performance from Harvard’s throwers.
“Our throwers have been so consistent for us,” Paidon said. “Consistency is huge in track because when you get to the championships meets, nothing is different.”
Harvard pair Ben Glauser and Dustin Brode finished first and second and qualified for the IC4A Championships in the shot put, and junior Matthew Polega edged out Army’s Richard Davis to take first in the weight throw.
In the individual tallies, Army just edged Harvard for the victory, but after a long lay-off from competition, Paison was excited to be competing again.
“There is just something about putting on a Harvard uniform and your spikes that puts you in a different mindset,” Paison said.  “It’s nice to get back into that rhythm.”

Among a field that included many of the nation’s top teams, the No. 3 Harvard men’s fencing team registered only one win in five attempts while the No. 7 women’s team only won twice on Saturday’s St. John’s Invitational at Carnasecca Arena in Jamaica, N.Y.
The men’s squad kept it close against No. 5 Ohio State, No. 4 Notre Dame, and No. 1 Penn State, falling 15-12, 15-12, and 17-10, respectively.
But the meet’s host, No. 6 St. John’s, dominated the Crimson, 19-8, in the meet’s last match. Harvard failed to register a victory in any weapon group, falling, 3-6, 1-8, and 4-5, in the foil, epee, and sabre, respectively.
Unranked Columbia was responsible for the Crimson’s lone victory on the meet.
The Lions rode momentum into the match from having just completed a14-13 upset over the St. John’s. But Harvard had no trouble in downing its Ivy League foe, winning, 16-11, behind strong 6-3 performances in both the epee and sabre.
The men’s epee team had a breakout performance. Despite a 22-23 record on the day, the team managed to top all schools except for St. John’s.
“Overall, they had a pretty good day, but against St. John’s, in their last match, they just weren’t in sync,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “I think St. John’s was an anomaly. I am quite confident they will recover.”
The men’s foil didn’t fare as well, winning just 14 bouts while dropping 31. The disappointing results just eclipsed the Nittany Lions men’s epee and Columbia men’s foil, which each recorded 16 victories, for the worst performance of any unit in the tournament.
Like the epee team, the Crimson’s sabre unit also turned in a record of 22-23.
On the women’s side, Harvard was able to hand top-ranked Penn State its first loss of the season by a score of 14-13 in the first matchup of the day.
But the No. 3 Crimson cooled off after the strong opening, mustering only one more victory—a 14-13 win over No. 6 St. John’s—the rest of the way.
Harvard’s three losses came to No. 3 Notre Dame, 15-12, No. 5 Ohio State, 21-6, and Columbia, 15-12.
“I think the meet overall reflects a need to reevaluate our training and figure out what we can do differently to prepare for [the] Ivy League Championships and NCAA Championships,” freshman Peregrine Badger said.
The Crimson’s top performers were some of the team’s most seasoned veterans.
“I was very happy with [sophomore] Alexandra Kiefer in the foil,” said Brand of his defending national champion. “She dropped a few bouts, but overall she is a brilliant performer, and I know for a fact she worked hard over the break and maintained her skills.”
For the men, it was captain Valentin Staller who led the way.
“Staller really is back on track,” Brand said. “I know he had a tough go of it in our last outing, but he certainly has recovered and fenced extremely well.”
But overall, Brand was not pleased with his team’s performance.
“I think we were off this time,” Brand said. “It might have been the long break or going against some of the toughest in the country. The timing was not great. We could have done better, but we didn’t.”
Harvard had not participated in a meet since it traveled to Penn State on Dec. 3. There, the roles were reversed, with both the Crimson men’s and women’s team bullying their opponents and coasting to easy victories except against the Nittany Lions, which swept Harvard by a scores of 15-12 on the men’s side and 16-11 for the women.
The men’s squad’s only two losses in regular season play last year came at St. John’s Super Cup, which featured the same six teams. Harvard had mixed results at the meet, balancing a pair of 16-11 losses against Penn State and the Fighting Irish with victories over then-ranked St. John’s, the Buckeyes, and the Lions.
The invitational is the men’s and women’s last meet before the Ivy League Championship on the second weekend in February, where the Crimson will come in as one of the favorites. The men might have the tougher task, though, as three other Ancient Eight squads—No. 2 Princeton, No. 7 Penn, and No. 10 Yale—are in the nation’s top 10.
“We anticipate having a good run at the Ivy League Championships, so we have to get back to work,” Brand said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two building years in which it developed its young talent, the Harvard ski team seemed poised to move up in the standings of the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association entering the 2012 season.
But in its first event of the year, a deep field and some bad luck kept the Crimson in its usual ninth-place position at the Bates Carnival held at the Sunday River and Black Mountain on Friday and Saturday.
Leading the charge were Harvard’s usual suspects, sophomore alpine racer Rebecca Nadler and junior Nordic skier Alena Tofte. Nadler took sixth in Friday’s giant slalom and 10th in Saturday’s slalom, while Tofte’s highlight performance was a seventh place finish in Friday’s 5k freestyle race.
Nadler’s finish came a year after she shocked the EISA with a fourth-place finish in her first-ever college carnival.
“I think that [sixth-place finish] was almost more impressive because the competition is much steeper this year,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said. “University of Vermont added three Norwegian skiers and one Canadian skier who’s also competing on the World Cup tour. Numbers wise, sixth is not as good as fourth, but that was fantastic.”
Nadler led the alpine women to a fourth-place finish in the giant slalom event. Also contributing was junior Catherine Sheils, who took 21st in the event, and captain Caroline McHugh, who finished 30th.
“She was that consistent finisher that made that result possible,” said Mitchell of McHugh, whose finish was necessary to put the team on the board.
“Without her putting down a solid clean run, there was going to be no women’s result,” Mitchell added.
Nadler, who is a fairly established threat in the giant slalom, was more excited about her finish in the slalom, which has not always been her strong suit.
“More than anything, I’m really happy with the way I attacked and skied the slalom [Saturday],” the sophomore said.  “Overall it was a really good weekend.”
“Rebecca skied a second run [that was] probably the best slalom run I’ve seen her ski in over a year,” Mitchell added.
But bad luck plagued the rest of the women’s alpine team, which finished eighth in the event.
“Catherine [Sheils] was skiing very well. It was difficult conditions, and she hit a pile of snow funny and went out of the course and back,” Mitchell noted. “She ended up having a pretty solid result. If you didn’t know she made a mistake, you wouldn’t have guessed. [Caroline McHugh’s] ski pole got stuck out of the starting gate, ripped her ski pole and glove off. It was just disappointing that that happened.”
Nadler and Sheils were the only Crimson skiers able to complete the course.
“If we had a third finisher, we probably would’ve been somewhere from third to fifth, but that’s ski racing—you’ve got to find the finish line.”
Meanwhile, the women’s Nordic team also posted solid results. Nordic coach Chris City ’94 was especially impressed with Tofte’s performance, in which she was able to successfully adjust to a change in weather conditions.
“We got about six inches of fresh powder [before Friday’s race],” City said. “All season we’ve been training on man-made snow, which tends to be hard and fast. Friday’s course was the opposite of that; it was pretty slow. She made the change she needed to, sort of on the fly, and skied really nicely.”
Tofte’s finish led the women’s Nordic team to a sixth-place finish in the 5k freestyle. The men’s Nordic team, meanwhile, took ninth in the 10k freestyle.
While Tofte’s best finish came on Friday, City noted that many of the Nordic skiers were stronger on Saturday.
“We generally raced better on the second day, which shows we have the fitness to compete,” City said. “I think we were pretty fresh on the second day, and we had some really encouraging results.”
Most encouraging was a 20th-place finish by sophomore Chris Stock in the 10k classic. City was also excited about junior Esther Kennedy’s 29th-place finish in the women’s 10k classic race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—The starters never got started Saturday night when the No. 24 Harvard men’s basketball team extended its winning streak to four games, topping Dartmouth, 54-38, for the second time in as many weeks.
Before Harvard could score, all five starters missed a shot, and three missed multiple times, before Keith Wright finally registered Harvard’s first points nearly six minutes into the game.
Then the backups came in. Junior Christian Webster and freshmen Steve Moundou-Missi and Corbin Miller led the squad on a 16-4 run to grab an 18-10 lead.
Webster finished with eight big points after missing the previous two contests with a hip injury. While recovering, Webster watched his backup, sophomore Laurent Rivard, shoot 50 percent from behind the arc and register back-to-back 16-point outings. Saturday, Rivard was two of seven from deep, netting only eight points.
After missing three games with a strained ligament in his left thumb, Miller made a three to give Harvard its first lead at 13-10 and finished with a team-high 13 points in 17 minutes of action.
“Corbin Miller, his three-point shots and offensive efficiency was much needed. Our bench production was terrific,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Coming off his best career performance, Moundou-Missi stayed hot. A week ago, he was seven of seven from the field and led the team with 16 points. In his second straight strong performance, Moundou-Missi tallied nine points and was equally solid on the defensive end, recording three steals and two blocks, both career highs.
“For a kid like Moundou-Missi to play as well as he did—his confidence is there,” Amaker said. “That’s a tremendous lift for us.”
STINGY D THE KEY
Moundou-Missi turned in a strong individual performance on the defensive end, and Harvard held the Big Green to a season-low 38 points thanks to cohesive team play.
“Harvard completely took us out of our offensive sets,” Dartmouth coach Paul Cormier said. “We, at times, looked…inept. That’s a real credit to Harvard. That’s why they are good.”
A key to the Crimson’s defensive success was its ability to slow down the Big Green’s leading scorer, freshman forward Gabas Maldunas.
In the first matchup between the two Ivy rivals, Maldunas led his team with 15 points.
This time around, the Lithuanian scored only six points, and none in the second half. Maldunas was forced to settle for jumpers from the outside and committed five turnovers in the rematch.
“He’s a crafty player,” Amaker said. “We certainly had a point of emphasis on trying to make sure we contain him.”
Harvard held the entire Dartmouth squad to 38 points, the fewest the Big Green has scored since early in 2009. The last time Harvard had as stingy a performance was 20 years ago against none other than Dartmouth, when it held the Big Green to 37 in 1992.
“They are probably the best defensive team in the Ivy League,” Dartmouth senior David Rufful said.
TRAVELING LIKE ROCKSTARS
Harvard’s impressive defensive outing came in front of a sellout crowd at Leede Arena. It was the first sellout for the Big Green since 2000.
Since entering the Top 25 in December, the Crimson has attracted much attention from both players and fans alike.
As long as the Crimson remains in the national spotlight and atop the Ivy League standings, it should expect more packed stands and energized opponents.
“[Harvard has] a target on their back in the Ivy League as well as beyond,” Rufful said. “Every team is shooting for them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s squash team (10-0, 3-0 Ivy) remains undefeated as it overpowered Trinity, 8-1, at the George A. Kellner Squash Center on Saturday afternoon, winning its fifth consecutive victory over the No. 5 Bantams (9-2).
“Undefeated” seems to be a word quite familiar to this Harvard squad, as four of its players—freshmen Amanda Sobhy and Megan Murray and juniors Laura Gemmell and Sarah Mumanachit—currently boast perfect records.
Sobhy earned her third win at the No. 1 position, taking down Trinity’s Catalina Pelaez in three straight games (11-2, 11-7, 11-0).
The rookie allowed her opponent to score just nine total points over the first two games and kept her scoreless in the third.
“We’re really happy to have Amanda playing at No. 1 with us now,” freshman Haley Mendez said. “She’s been playing great, and it’s huge for the team to have such a strong No. 1 that can guarantee a win. It gives us all a boost of confidence and an edge.”
Gemmell, who went undefeated both in her freshman and sophomore regular seasons, looks to be headed for a repeat, topping Trinity’s No. 2 Alicia Rodriguez to improve her record to 6-0. While Gemmell comfortably won the first two games (11-3, 11-4), Rodriguez rallied hard in the third before Gemmell ultimately prevailed, 13-11, to nab the victory.
Playing at the No. 3 position, co-captain Nirasha Guruge put on a similarly dominating performance, defeating Bantam rookie Ashley Tidman in a three game sweep (11-6, 11-9, 11-7).
The closest and perhaps most exciting matches of the day were at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots, both of which were pushed to a decisive fifth game.
At the No. 4 position, Trinity’s Natalie Babjukova gained an early lead on Mendez, taking a very close first game, 11-9, and then grabbing the second game, 11-4.
But Mendez made a sudden comeback in the third game, overcoming Babjukova to win, 11-7. With momentum swinging, the rookie then snatched the fourth game, 11-6, to tie Babjukova at two games apiece.
In the fifth, the two traded points, but Mendez took the game, 11-9, to complete the comeback.
“[Babjukova] was super quick getting all my balls and it really caught me by surprise,” Mendez said. “So I revised my game plan, waiting patiently to attack until it was the right moment, and I was ultimately able to come back, which was great.”
Crimson junior Natasha Kingshott appeared poised to pick up her eighth straight victory after she gained an early advantage with an 11-9 victory against Bantam Jennifer Pelletier in the first game at the No. 5 spot.
But Pelletier quickly took back the lead, earning convincing wins in the second and third games, 11-3 and 11-5, respectively.
Kingshott came back to win the fourth game, 11-9, but it was not enough, as Pelletier took the fifth, 11-9. The loss was Kingshott’s first of the season and Harvard’s only defeat of the day.
The Crimson clinched its overall victory over Trinity with co-captain Cece Cortes’s win over Bantam senior Andrea Echeverria at the No. 6 position.
After losing the first game, Cortes fought back to gain three straight wins by a score of 11-8.
At the No. 7 spot, Mumanachit extended her undefeated record to 8-0, taking down Trinity junior Robyn Hodgson in an intense five-game contest.
Four of the Crimson’s eight individual match victories against Trinity were earned by freshmen, including Julianne Chu’s 3-1 win in the No. 8 position and Murray’s 3-1 victory playing at the No. 9 spot.
“It was a really big day for us freshmen,” Chu said. “We weren’t expecting to do so well because we knew that Trinity has a very talented team, and so we were especially happy to all come out with victories that day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Riding high after its demolition of Brown on Thursday, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team took on No. 8 Ohio State hoping to maintain its 13-meet win streak.
But the Crimson (4-1, 4-0 Ivy) found life outside the Ivy League much more difficult, as the Buckeyes (9-0, 2-0 Big Ten) took control early and gave Harvard its first loss of the season, 181-118, on Saturday in Columbus, Ohio.
Coming off a 10-day training camp in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and its recent Ivy success, the team was looking at this weekend as a chance to gauge its progress at this point in the season. Despite the loss, the Crimson put up some impressive individual performances, including three individual wins from freshman Chuck Katis.
“A lot of people were looking at this weekend as a litmus test for how the next few weeks will go,” sophomore Chris Satterthwaite said. “Ohio State is definitely one of the better, if not the best team we will swim against all season. We wanted to come in and give some good swims, and the team definitely did that.”
The Crimson came into McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion energized to take on a ranked foe.
“The excitement of being in a new place really gets you going and excited, especially when it’s Ohio State and they have one of the nicest pools in the country,” freshman Griffin Schumacher said.
The Buckeyes began the meet with two strong victories. After edging Harvard’s ‘A’ 200-yard medley relay team by under a second, Ohio State swept the top three spots in the 1000 freestyle and jumped out to a 29-7 lead.
But the Crimson fought back, with Satterthwaite winning the 200 freestyle with a time of 1:39.09. Freshman Zach Walters took second behind him at 1:39.95.
“I was really happy with my time [in the 200 Freestyle],” Satterthwaite said. “It’s a lot of fun to go up against these guys [from Ohio State], and I was definitely happy with the place.”
And after Harvard dropped the first two finishes in the 100 backstroke, Katis earned his first victory of the day in the 100 breaststroke, finishing in 55.29 seconds and earning nine points for his team. Junior Owen Wurzbacher finished third with a time of 57.08, gaining another three points for the Crimson.
But after Katis’ first victory, the Buckeyes again asserted their dominance, taking a 1-2-3 finish in the 200 butterfly. Senior Niall Janney was Harvard’s top performer at 1:52.06, good for fourth place.
The Crimson’s younger swimmers impressed in the 50 freestyle, with Schumacher finishing second in 20.46 seconds and sophomore Oliver Lee taking third with a time of 20.91.
The swimmers then took a break as the meet moved to the one-meter diving.  Freshman Mike Mosca had taken first in the one-meter against Brown with a score of 347.93. But Ohio State sophomore Christian Holstein was a cut above everyone in the pool, finishing twenty points ahead of all other divers with a score of 359.25.  Mosca finished third with 331.65.
In the three-meter dive, Mosca again picked up third with a score of 366.83.  Buckeye sophomore duo Shane Miszkiel and Holstein set the pace, scoring 425.48 and 416.93, respectively.
Satterthwaite then got back in the water for the 100 freestyle, where he was just out touched by Ohio State junior Jason Schnur and took second place with a time of 44.91 seconds.
Katis earned his second win of the day with a commanding victory in the 200 breaststroke, topping Buckeye freshman Christopher Cowley by three seconds.  He later picked up his third win in similar fashion, outpacing Janney for a 1:50.35 finish in the 200-yard individual medley.
“Chuck has had a definitely phenomenal season, and his meet Saturday was a testament to that,” Satterthwaite said.
But the sophomore’s praise did not end with Katis.
“The freshman class as a whole has been excellent.  We had one of the strongest recruiting classes in the country and they have all lived up to expectations.”
With the win out of reach, the Crimson ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ relay teams faced off and registered quality times heading back into Ancient Eight competition.
“Our relay at the end was probably the best race of the meet,” Satterthwaite said. “We were pretty close to our Ivy Championship time from last season and all of our guys put in great swims.”
Harvard will be back in action in the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet at Blodgett Pool, the team’s biggest meet before the Ivy Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a training trip in Puerto Rico, a win against Ivy League rival Brown, and a week of practice, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team travelled to Evanston, Ill., to take on two Big Ten teams, Northwestern and Iowa. And after starting the season 5-0, the Crimson (5-2, 5-0 Ivy) had its winning streak snapped, falling to Iowa by seven points, 153-146, and to Northwestern, 172-127.
“It was really great that we got to go up against two Big Ten teams,” senior Meghan Leddy said.  “We’ve never swam Northwestern or Iowa before, so it was fun to go to the Midwest and compete against teams outside of the Ivy League.”
The meet was dominated by the Wildcats, who defended their home pool, claiming victory over both teams while taking nine of the 16 first-place finishes.  The Hawkeyes followed with five victories.
The Crimson claimed one first-place finish—Leddy in the 200 backstroke—seven second-place finishes, and placed three women in the top six in both backstroke and butterfly events in addition to the 200 IM.
“It was supposed to be a Northwestern-Iowa dual meet and we kind of crashed the party,” Leddy said. “It was nice to put up some great times to show them that a school that isn’t a scholarship school is able to break them up.”
Leddy and junior Caroline Weaver highlighted the backstroke events. Weaver finished right after Leddy in the 200 backstroke at 2:03.95 for a one-two finish for the Crimson in the event. Junior Laura Evans contributed a fourth-place finish at 2:05.14.
“We’re definitely right on par with them, so we were very evenly matched,” sophomore Danielle Schulkin said.  “There were races where we had swimmers go one-two, there were races where they’d go one-two, and there were races that [the finishes] were hundredths [of seconds] apart.”
In the 100 backstroke, Weaver, Leddy and sophomore Deirdre Clute, took third, fourth, and fifth, respectively. Weaver clocked in at 57.57, .3 seconds out of second place, and was followed  closely by her teammates at 58.29 and 58.39.
In the butterfly events, freshman Ana Anaya and Schulkin each took second place in the 100 and 200, respectively.  In the 100, Anaya finished in 56.58, .36 seconds out of first place.  Schulkin stopped the clock shortly after with a time of 56.79 for a fourth-place finish, behind Iowa sophomore Abbey Tuchscherer by .07 seconds. Sophomore Jenna Gregoire finished in fifth with a time of 56.96.
“It was really fun because we didn’t necessarily have the pressure of a league meet, but we still really wanted to win,” Schulkin said. “We still had a lot of competition where you didn’t necessarily know who was going to win or not.”
The Crimson finished second, third, and fifth in the 200 butterfly with a second-place time of 2:01.87 by Schulkin. Anaya finished next at 2:03.17, and senior Hilary Roberts followed, clocking in at 2:04.51.
Harvard earned another second-place finish in the 200 IM from freshman Courtney Otto, who stopped the clock at 2:04.99, just .01 seconds behind first-place finisher, Northwestern senior Jacquie Godbe. Otto also placed third in the 100 freestyle with a time of 10:09.82 and fourth in the 200 breaststroke at 2:21.22.
“I think everyone did really well for where we are in the season,” Leddy said. “Everyone was hitting their season times, so I think that was pretty solid across the board. And girls from the first heat were posting up times that were holding in the second heat.”
The Crimson took fourth and fifth in the 200 IM as well with strong performances from Evans and freshman Faith Martin, who finished the race in 2:05.87.  Evans followed at 2:06.60, touching out Hawkeye sophomore Haley Gordon by .18 seconds.
“We just wanted to come out fighting, kind of scare the Big Ten teams, and show them how we represent the Ivy League,” Leddy said.
Other second place finishes for the afternoon came during the 200 freestyle, the 100 breaststroke, and the 500 freestyle.  In the 200 freestyle, senior Catherine Zagroba finished in 1:50.77, pushing Wildcat sophomore Jackie Powell into third by .11 seconds.  Freshman Stephanie Ferrell stopped the clock in the 100 breaststroke at 1:04.79, and Zagroba scored another second-place finish in the 500 freestyle with a time of 4:54.40.
“[This meet] was really good because we’re gearing up for a lot of fast meets,” Schulkin said. “We have [Yale and Princeton] in two weeks, and then we have [the Ivy League Championships] three weeks after that. There will be a lot of close races, and we haven’t had that many this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Baltimore Ravens kicker Bill Cundiff’s 32-yard field goal sailed wide left, many Cantabrigians celebrated.
But the New England Patriots’ win sent one former Harvard hero home, where he will decide whether the time has come to hang up the cleats.
Matt Birk ’98 led a Ravens offensive line to the AFC Championship Game Sunday in Foxboro to face Tom Brady and the Patriots. But after Brady’s one-yard run gave the Patriots the lead with over 11 minutes remaining, Birk and the Ravens offense couldn’t put together a scoring drive.
After Cundiff’s missed kick put an end to Birk’s 14th professional season, many have wondered if this is the end for the six-time Pro Bowler. While some reports indicated this would be the last go-around for Birk, the center himself recently denied those claims.
But while the loss will be tough to digest for Birk, this week has given the former Crimson standout some positive attention for his off-the-field achievements, as he was recently nominated for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award. The award, which recognizes a player’s commitment to community service and his football prowess, will be announced Feb. 4 at the same ceremony as the MVP award.
Birk was nominated for his work with the HIKE Foundation, which helps at-risk youth receive proper educational resources and attention.
His fellow nominees include San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and Chicago Bears cornerback Charles Tillman.
In Jeremy Lin ’10 news, the usual pattern has returned.
After being sent down to the NBA D-League by the New York Knicks, Lin played one game for the Erie Bayhawks and dominated, dropping 28 points, dishing out 12 assists, and grabbing 11 rebounds on Jan. 20.
It didn’t take long for the guard to get recalled. Just three days after his dominant performance, the Knicks summoned Lin back to the Big Apple.

If you're looking for an easy class to round out your course load, search no further.
1. Drama 110: "Beginning Acting"
 
Looking for something a little different to put on your schedule? "Beginning Acting" has less than three hours of work per week and a high Q-score of 4.75. Forty-five percent of participants found the class to be "very easy." Unfortunately, you must audition for the class, so the hardest part may be just getting in.
2. Astronomy 301hf: "Journal Club"
"Journal Club" was ranked "very easy" or "easy" by 73 percent of participants, and of the 15 students who filled out the Q Guide, only one student reported that the workload was over three hours a week. You can't go wrong with a class that exclaims, "This will be fun!" on its syllabus.
3. Anthropology 1165: "Digging the Glyphs: Adventures in Decipherment" [2013]
Only one of the 185 people who evaluated this course found it to be difficult last year.  Requiring just over three hours of work per week, "Digging the Glyphs" is an easy way to fulfill the Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding Gen Ed while learning how to decipher extinct languages.
4. Science of Living Systems 25: "Trees, Forests, and Global Change"
This small class offers a stress-free way to fulfill the Science of Living Systems requirement. Last year, less than 10 people took this Gen Ed, and they all found it to be "easy" or "very easy." As a bonus, the class includes fun laboratory assignments like campus tree tours and fieldtrips to the Glass Flower Museum and the Harvard Forest.
5. United States in the World 30: "Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History" [2013]
"Mostly we want you to look," the syllabus for "Tangible Things" says, and the class gives you an opportunity to explore Harvard's libraries and archives for credit. Last year, two-thirds of the class found the course "easy" or "very easy."
6. Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 11: "Making Sense: Language, Logic, and Communication" [2013]
For students who like words better than numbers, this class provides a pain-free way to fulfill the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning Gen Ed, as it examines language as an algorithm. Even better, the course has a lower workload rating than other Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning classes.
7. History of Science 138: "Sex, Gender, and Evolution"
From a quick scan of HarvardFML, it seems that Harvard students are thinking and writing about sex and gender quite often. This History of Science class gives you a chance to do that for credit without the fear of too challenging a course; only one student out of 36 rated the course "difficult" last semester.
8. Mind, Brain, and Behavior 96: "The Science of Happiness"
As the title implies, this class gives you the opportunity to study happiness with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that a third of the students last year found the course "very easy."
9. Sociology 43: "Social Interaction"
For those who enjoy people watching, this class is a perfect elective. "Social Interaction" has a workload of under six hours a week, and some of that time is spent observing people interact in various settings and journaling about the experience.
10. TWI A: "Elementary Twi"
Want to learn a new language that most of your friends won't have heard of? Try Twi, an African language spoken in Ghana. This easy, introductory class has less than three hours of work per week and was rated "easy," according to the only student who evaluated it.
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: January 24, 2012.
  Three of the courses, "Digging the Glyphs," "Tangible Things," and "Making Sense," were incorrectly marked as being offered this year. In fact, they are available in 2013.
