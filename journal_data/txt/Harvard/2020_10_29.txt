After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Those of us who were fortunate to have experienced campus life in its full vivaciousness took for granted some of the everyday privileges and delights that students are now denied — especially the face-to-face interactions that help to make the Harvard community.
I came to this conclusion in a recent conversation with a fellow alum as I was reminiscing about Harvard’s unique campus experience. What prompted this trip down memory lane was remembering John Pomeroy on the second anniversary of his death. John, the security guard at Dunster House, was one of those rare special people who can make a college experience. Two years since his death, he continues to have a massive impact on the lives of many Harvard students and alums. I’m sure “Doc,” as he was endearingly called by those closest to him, would have a few lessons for current students too.
I first met John in 2005 as a sophomore in Dunster House, back when it was jokingly referred to as “Dumpster.” Locked out of my room, I went to the super’s office to confess my crime. As I entered, John’s warmth suffused the space, which, because of his presence, would become a soothing retreat for those who needed a respite from busy schedules. He greeted me with his trademark smile and mistook my strong London accent as Australian, adding that I sounded like the Geico lizard. “You should tell the girls that’s your voice,” he joked. We gelled immediately, and the encounter would be the beginning of a close friendship that would last 14 years.
John was like a mentor to many undergrads. He gave me, an international student, invaluable insight into American culture. In the way only a local could, he introduced me to the rich cultural sites in and around Boston, spurring me to regularly take a break from the Harvard Square bubble.
During my college summers, I joined John on his side hustle, roofing. Suffice to say, the heat and humidity made for challenging conditions. But good hard labor can do wonders for the mind and body. As the sun beat down on us, we’d enjoy an ice cold Coke (Diet for John), reminiscent of the scene in “The Shawshank Redemption” where, after tarmacking a roof, Andy Dufresne and his friends take a well-earned respite.
After I graduated from the College, I moved to New York for graduate school at Columbia University. I kept in touch with John, and when I visited him in person, we’d go to Jeveli’s, the historic Italian restaurant in East Boston where John had once worked. He showed me the newly renovated Dunster; if ever there’s a space in which I’d have to endure a lockdown, I wouldn’t mind it there!
Despite the physical distance between us, John was always there for me, especially when I butted heads with professors at Columbia. I was not willing to compromise my values for the sake of career advancement, which did not go down well with those who had differing political persuasions and outlooks on life. Stressing the importance of personal responsibility, John taught me to persevere despite the odds and take ownership of such difficult situations (he was not one for complaining!). He was the best “trainer” one could hope to have in one’s corner as I ultimately defended my dissertation successfully in May 2018 — the end of a journey we had shared together. Sadly, John died five months later.
John’s presence is still felt among the countless people who were lucky to encounter him on Harvard’s campus and beyond. We would do well to heed his wisdom in these difficult times. We must first accept our current predicament and only then can we choose how to respond in order to make the best of it. We must take one day at a time and focus on the here and now, starting with the basics (eat and sleep!).
While campus may be limited, students can seek out opportunities around them. Cambridge, for example, has many quaint squares beyond Harvard’s. Both it and Boston can be experienced on a shoestring budget, and there may be part-time job opportunities to be found too. Students still on campus should take advantage of what these great cities have to offer, even now — perhaps especially now.
I’m imagining a sight that always made John smile returning in the near future: the sun shining brightly on campus courtyards buzzing with excitement as students socialize and engage in their intellectual pursuits, with a renewed optimism in the air around Harvard, Cambridge, and the world beyond. As current students find ways to adjust and make the most of the present situation, they must remain optimistic about that future. For, as John would say, “This too shall pass.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A fall without punch. Twelve final clubs have decided to forgo the timeworn sophomore gauntlet in the face of a global pandemic. For our part, we’re not that disappointed — yes, even the sophomores among us.
Punch brings out some of the worst in Harvard: aggressive social jockeying for elitist institutions that have a history of sexual misconduct. Punch is, at best, a distraction from the ways we can positively engage with one another, build each other up, make space for solidarity and connection across social distances (of various kinds). At its worst, punch creates a hostile environment that pins the self-worth of students to their capacity to seem “cool” or be “relevant” — whatever those things really mean — and glorifies the piggish practices the clubs have enshrined. Yeah, we’ll pass.
But we’re also not celebrating. The lack of punch this year by no means indicates that final clubs are on the decline. There will more than likely be punch next year, and, if you ask us, it will be more brutal than ever. Why?
While Mount Auburn Street sits silent — free of the besuited boys who wait outside red and blue painted doors, un-rumbled by ostentatious speakers — sophomores (and freshmen) are sitting in their solitary dorm rooms or bedrooms, longing for social interaction: a party, a rave, a darty, a beer pong tournament, even just a chance encounter.
And that’s exactly what punch is. The promise of a final club — the Thursday dinners, the tight and sweaty spaces, the drunken singing — is everything we can’t have, and now, exactly what we long for.
Final clubs are built on their exclusiveness. Their power is a product of their mystery and unattainability. A year without punch will only add to that — hyping them up more, making them feel ever more tantalizing, ever more forbidden, ever more desirable.
What’s more, this summer, Harvard announced the end of its short-lived sanctions against the clubs and their members. As such, there are no institutional factors deterring students from joining.
All of these factors paint a grim picture: More than twice as many freshmen said they are “very interested” in joining a final club, sorority, or fraternity as did last year. Whether that’s the misery of COVID-19 or the end of sanctions — and it’s probably both — it’s good news for final clubs and their power at Harvard.
As Harvard looks ahead to bringing more students back to campus and rebuilding its in-person community, it will need to be mindful of that increased power.
We have long been in favor of the University taking action to create more safe, on-campus spaces for students to socialize in so that students do not feel compelled to join finals clubs as their only options on weekends. This will only be more important upon returning back to a campus in which the main thing the plurality of students have been missing is social interaction.
Moreover, coronavirus will likely still loom over social interactions when the clubs begin to return to campus. The efficacy of public health guidelines relies heavily on individuals and groups choosing to follow standards of public health, even when it’s least desirable. And college students, particularly social organizations, have done a pretty poor job of making these choices. Final clubs and their members, in particular, have a history of not following, or outright rejecting, particular policies. And as a result, we’re highly skeptical that the groups will all of a sudden forgo large gatherings and maintain strong public health practices — something the University will have limited capacity to control, given that clubs are private property.
To be sure, the delay may change social dynamics. Current sophomores could return to campus as battleworn juniors, less vulnerable to social pressure, and therefore less eager to punch. If the process, known to be competitive and taxing, sparkles less through older eyes, some in the class might pass on punch even if the clubs offer them a re-do.
Final clubs, like it or not, continue to be institutions of tremendous power on our campus. The University’s failed attempt to sanction the clubs is only the most obvious example of that pressing fact. And COVID-19 is by no means a check on that clout. With public health on the line, the choices clubs make and the messages they send to students are only more significant.
Perhaps they will surprise us.

“Everyone hates you—”
ReThink! Are you sure you want to say this?
At age 13, Trisha N. Prabhu ’22 read about Rebecca Sedwick, a middle school girl who made national news when she died by suicide due to relentless cyberbullying. She was only one year younger than Prabhu at the time.
A victim of cyberbullying herself, Prabhu resolved then and there to do something about the problem.
“I remember reading that story and thinking something’'s wrong here,” Prabhu says. “Something is very wrong with our internet, with what it’'s become, and what we are sending young people into when they get a phone.”
After some digging, Prabhu found that social media sites mostly relied on victims to block cyberbullies and tell an adult. But what if she targeted the root of the issue?
Seven years later, Prabhu is the CEO of ReThink, an organization centered around an eponymous app. The app gives users an additional keyboard on their phone, which detects potentially hurtful language. Rather than censoring users, the app sends them messages asking them if they are sure about their words: ”ReThink! Don’t say things that you may regret later!” or a similar variation. The app now has over 500,000 downloads, and the organization has worked with 5 million students in over 1,500 schools across 134 countries.
The concept of ReThink grew out of Prabhu’s original research — work that made her a 2014 Google Science Fair finalist at age 13. The rational part of our brains, the prefrontal cortex, isn’t fully developed until age 25, so Prabhu wondered how a simple cue might boost teenagers’ impulse control. Her research found that when students are prompted to rethink a mean message, they decide not to send it more than 93 percent of the time.
“If I’m a young person who’s gotten into a feud with another young person and I’m looking at a phone screen, I’m desensitized to what’s happening,” Prabhu says. “To top it off, my brain isn’t fully equipped to think through the consequences of hitting send. That’s going to be a pretty messy recipe for disaster.”
Although the ReThink app places the responsibility of fighting cyberbullying in the hands of bullies themselves, Prabhu says that ReThink’s design also treats bullies with compassion.
“I think when we think of people as bad […] we take the worst version of that person and we make that worst version that entire person,” she says. “Instead of saying, ‘Hey, there’s something wrong with you. Why on earth would you ever say something like that?’, We’re saying, ‘Mistakes happen. People make mistakes.’ But it is how we respond to those mistakes that ultimately decides who we are.”
Developing the app from scratch wasn’t easy.
“It was 100 percent hustle. It was literally me picking up the phone and being like, ‘Hello, my name is Trisha, I’m calling from ReThink’s tech department, my tech department of one,’” Prabhu says, laughing.
Being young was a “double-edged sword.” A teenager herself, she understood the thoughts and behavior of people her age much better than the typical adult app developer. In a male-dominated field, however, she had to confront the assumptions many made about the capabilities of a 15-year-old girl.
“There were a lot of people who looked at me and thought, ‘Oh, that’s really cute,’ and [did not take] me very seriously,” Prabhu recalls. “And I think it was also difficult being specifically not a 15-year-old guy in a hoodie who’s the next Mark Zuckerberg. That’s what everyone thinks of.”
Prabhu has been invited to the White House, given a TED Talk in India, and received $100,000 in funding from Shark Tank investors after appearing on the show.
Most recently this October, Prabhu received “the ultimate validation”: the Elevate prize, a $300,000 award to put toward ReThink. The competition chose ten winners overall from a pool of about 1,300 applicants who use their organizations to promote positive social change.
Prabhu’s personal connection to her work helped her stand out from the other candidates.
“The concept of cyber bullying is not something that Tricia necessarily just heard about or read about,” says Njideka F. Harry, one of the competition’s judges and founder of the Youth for Technology Foundation. “She also lived that experience. Looking [for] the individuals that are making change based on lived experiences was very, very critical [for the judges].,”
Using the money from the Elevate prize, Prabhu wants to expand ReThink’s mission to reach more users: increasing the languages offered from six to 12, investing in image and video detection, and exploring suicidal ideation recognition.
Though she plans to stay with the organization for the foreseeable future, Prabhu knows her life after ReThink will remain centered on social entrepreneurship — a concept she says is “much more than a buzzword” to her.
“I really want to spend my life creating things specifically around this idea of social venture and social entrepreneurship,” Prabhu says. For her, it’'s about “finding a way to build really invaluable cutting-edge products that are also doing good for the world. This idea that business and good are mutually exclusive — we can upend that narrative.”
For now, Prabhu is focused on changing internet culture. A hopeful trend has emerged in Prabhu’s ReThink research: After continued use of the app, students claim to start rethinking their words before even being prompted by their keyboard.
“To us, that’s the ultimate win because that’s the long term behavioral impact, right?” Prabhu says. “I think the real power of ReThink is not only that we’re stopping cyberbullying in the moment, but that we’re hopefully cultivating the next generation of responsible digital citizens who long-term [are] not going to post that message.”
“That is ultimately how we build the internet we want to see.”

In normal years, teenagers and college students would huddle together in maze-like walkways that don’t really lead anywhere, thumbing through glossy-paged comic books. They would learn to draw, write, and design in workshops with local comic artists.
But 2020 is not a normal year — and much of what was normal at the Massachusetts Independent Comics Expo had to be changed.
Produced by the Boston Comic Arts Foundation and hosted by Lesley University’s College of Art and Design, MICE was established in 2010 to provide comic artists and writers in the greater Boston area an opportunity to showcase their work. When the COVID-19-induced lockdown began in March, MICE was still in the early stages of planning this year’s event. The conference was setting up the application process for exhibitors. “We were kind of in a privileged position compared to other shows,” says Shelli Paroline, co-director of MICE. “We didn’t have any venue booked; we hadn’t spent any money.”
Hosting an in-person conference would be impossible, but cancelling the expo was, too. So many stories from MICE’s past centered on the human connections made at a show — “We’ve heard so many people say things like, ‘I met my future husband at MICE, I met my best friend and collaborator at MICE,’” Paroline remembers. “We had this kid who went to all the panels and realized he had to add plot to all of his comics. It was just nuts.”
Intent on preserving this spirit, the team settled on holding a virtual convention. Organizers decided that an extended expo would be more conducive to the new environment — sessions held over the course of a couple of weekends in October, instead of all combined into a single weekend. Attendees wouldn’t have to sit in front of a computer all day, and they would also now have greater flexibility to participate in case they were busy one week.
Creators could not take advantage of a big crowd, since the events were more dispersed. The magic of coming across a particular comic artist, or bumping into an old friend, or going out afterwards to drink with buddies would also be quite difficult to replicate. And workshop interactions were limited to “a small group projecting to a larger audience,” MICE Marketer Zachary B. Clemente says.
MICE streamed most of its workshops and panels live via CrowdCast and Facebook. The conference also hosted a Creator Showcase every weekend of the expo between panels. These were a series of short videos submitted by independent comic creators showing off their latest work, put together by the organizers. This would be one way to recreate the opportunities to connect with publishers and readers that comic creators would’ve normally found in person.
“I don’t think you can compare a virtual convention to the excitement and energy generated by an in-person show, but MICE was well-organized and well-attended,” says graphic novelist Sophie E. Goldstein, who led a cover design workshop. “Virtual cons thus far have not been able to replicate anything like the tabling experience of a show… but the panel experience was as good if not better, in some respects.”
Children’s author and illustrator Mika Song, who led a character creation workshop, says of the platform, “I think some people are more likely to comment virtually if they are shy and so that can be nice for some quieter kids. It is also cool that the video is up online for a while so people can use it as a resource in the classroom.”
Dakotah L. Kennedy, who has attended MICE for the past four years, agrees. “I’m really glad that they turned it into a month long event since it had to shift to a virtual format. I’ve never attended the panels before as I always go to meet creators, learn about new comics, and shop,” she says.
The structure of sponsorships also changed. The expo relies mainly on two sources of income, table fees, and comic store or publisher patronage. This year, MICE enjoyed the boon of funds left over from previous years and the support of community partners, such as arts advocacy organizations, comic distributors, and publishers, to assist the transition to a virtual platform. MICE also managed to find sponsors for nearly every event on the program.
“We’ve outraised nearly any other show as far as sponsorships are concerned,” Paroline says. “People really stepped up and said they’re happy with what we’re doing.”
The grants awarded at the show changed as well. “We’re creatives too, and this year was very hard emotionally. We were asking ourselves, what can we do that actually promotes creativity?” Paroline says. Acknowledging the toll COVID-19 has taken on the arts, MICE gave out 32 mini-grants of $100 — more than four times the amount they gave in normal years. The team also established a Grand Prize of $500, awarded to Ingrid Pierre for her comic “Do Not Resuscitate,” a piece about a young woman who loses her fiance to terminal illness and then reunites with his reanimated corpse. MICE also gave four free sponsorships to local comic book stores.
The virtual nature of this year’s expo greatly expanded MICE’s geographic reach within the U.S. and globally. “We were able to include international creators in our programming, which we normally couldn’t do because travel is so expensive,” Clemente says. Goldstein, who is from Tulsa, Okla., definitely saw the upside of being able to attend the convention from her living room.
In the future, however, MICE plans to keep the expo local. The virtual format and broadened geography are important during the pandemic, but Clemente believes independent comic culture thrives in the small — the scrappy.
“Indie comics is so regionally-based, it’s so based off of fairs and collectives and underground groups hanging out and making comics,” Clemente says with conviction. “That’s where it was born.”

Twenty marble busts look down onto vaulted Annenberg Hall, their physical position marking them as great figures of Harvard’s history. In the center of the wall to the right of the main entrance, sits the bust of W.E.B. Du Bois, the only Black person among them.
“Neil [Rudenstine] took the velvet hood off and everybody gave a standing ovation. I mean, many people cried. I thought it was just beautiful,” Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. remembers of the statue’s unveiling ceremony in 1993, which he and the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes led in Memorial Church. Gates still remembers the powerful symbolism of this ceremony when he goes “to Memorial Hall for Commencement dinner, and the president always speaks right under the statue of the great Du Bois.”
Yet this monument to one of the most important intellectuals and civil rights advocates in American history has a history of its own, one intertwined with white supremacy and the politics of visual representation today.
***
The Department of African and African American Studies commissioned the bust in 1993. At the time, the department only had three members: Kwame Anthony Appiah, Werner Sollors, and Gates.
“The first thing I proposed to the administration was that we honor W.E.B. Du Bois, the greatest Black intellectual in history,” Gates says. “There was no portrait, no photographs, and no sculpture.”
Du Bois, who lived from 1868 to 1963, was a prominent civil rights leader, sociologist, historian, professor, and writer. He founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard, and the author of several seminal pieces of literature in sociology and history.
“We got approval for the creation of a bust, and we wanted it to be a marble bust in a place of prominence,” Gates says. “We wanted marble because all the other figures are in marble in Memorial Hall. It didn’t make sense to have the one Black man in bronze. If we were going to honor him, it’s not like [busts] are representational in terms of color, but the likeness to Du Bois.”
Harvard appointed an independent committee to choose the sculptor. “I was hoping that the University would commission an African American sculptor, particularly Martin Puryear, but I was told I didn’t have the vote,” Gates says. The committee did not consult the members of the department. In the end, the committee selected Walker Hancock, a World War II veteran who had coordinated the safeguarding of French art during the Nazi’s invasion and had made busts of two Supreme Court justices.
“All I was told was that he had done a marble bust of Earl Warren, who was our hero because he was the Supreme Court justice when Brown v. Board was decided in 1954, and Warren Berger, who was more conservative,” Gates recalls. “Let’s say he wasn’t on our list of heroes, but, you know, it seemed fine.”
***
But it turned out that Hancock had worked on another project: the Confederate monument at Stone Mountain, Ga., which depicts Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson. The Atlanta chapter of the NAACP — the very organization Du Bois founded — has called it “the world’s largest shrine to white supremacy.”
Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams drew attention to the monument in a series of 2017 tweets, writing, “The removal of the bas relief of Confederates from Stone Mountain has been a constant debate since the state bought the property in 1958. Paid for by founders of the 2nd KKK, the monument had no purpose other than celebration of racism, terror & division when carved in 1915.”
Hancock did not complete it until 1972.
The story of the 1,700-foot tall monument’s completion is convoluted, spanning nearly six decades and several sculptors.
In 1915, the Ku Klux Klan celebrated its rebirth with a cross burning at the top of Stone Mountain. Later that year Caroline Helen Plane, a charter member of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, hired Gutzon Borglum to sculpt prominent confederates into the mountain’s side.
By 1925, funds for the project were running thin, and Borglum was fired over a financial dispute. Claiming that the work was his property, he destroyed his models and escaped to North Carolina when the Association put a warrant out for his arrest. Two years later, he was hired to work on Mount Rushmore.
The Association sandblasted off the incomplete face of Lee that Borglum had carved. It finally hired Henry Augustus Lukeman to finish the project after many other sculptors declined their offer. But money remained tight. With the approval of Calvin Coolidge and the 1924 Congress, the U.S. Mint commissioned a silver half dollar (designed by Borglum) with the words “Stone Mountain” and engravings of Davis and Jackson on its face as a fundraiser for the monument. Fundraising was unsuccessful, and the project halted in 1928.
Lukeman’s partial carving remained largely untouched for the next 30 years. After Brown v. Board of Education ruled school segregation unconstitutional in 1954, Marvin Griffin declared his candidacy for governor, running on the promise to uphold segregation and finish the Stone Mountain carving. He fulfilled his promise, and in 1958, the Georgia state legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain and complete the monument.
Enter Hancock. Working from Lukeman’s models and unfinished carvings, Hancock chipped away at the project from 1963 until 1972. (Progress was revealed in a 1970 ceremony which Richard Nixon was scheduled to attend — he cancelled at the last minute out of fear that association with the Confederacy would hurt his chances of confirming G. Harrold Carwell to the Supreme Court. Spiro Agnew was sent in his place.)
***
To this day, the monument at Stone Mountain stands as the largest commemoration of the Confederacy in the country. And the question of how to view the bust of Du Bois in light of this is particularly salient given the seemingly irreconcilable contradictions contained in Hancock’s life and work. Robin E. Kesley, the FAS Dean of Arts and Humanities and head of the newly-developed Task Force on Visual Culture, said “knowing this about Walker Hancock changes my experience of the bust of Du Bois. Because everything I know about the conditions of the production of a work of art changes how I look at the work of art.” But for Kelsey, although this knowledge may give him a “richer understanding of the history of its making, that bust will still speak to me of W.E.B. Du Bois as it always has.”
The painful contradictions of American history seem to be contained within this bust. What Hancock’s motivations or personal convictions were cannot be known, and perhaps remain the greatest mystery of this story. But it is clear that his role in sculpting both the bust and the monument at Stone Mountain raise a host of vital questions about what it means to commemorate, and how the ways in which we memorialize reflect the values of our society.
Professor Gates closed with the thought that these questions should be discussed by students, faculty, and the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage. “But,” he added, “I happen to think it’s a beautiful sculpture, and I have for the last 30 years.”

On Oct. 15, the Harvard Book Store shared a letter with its patrons on its website and social media platforms. It’s a heartfelt rumination on the difficulties of running a small business amid a pandemic, reflecting the store owners’ worries about surviving during an economic crisis. To date, the letter has garnered over 3,700 likes across Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
The store’s co-owners, husband and wife Jeffrey Mayersohn ’73 and Linda Seamonson, first purchased the Harvard Book Store during a period of economic turmoil back in 2008. Now, they face another crisis: navigating the future of their business under COVID-19.
In the letter, Mayersohn and Seamonson open up to their customers about a necessary shift in their usual holiday retail calendar. “We ask our community to please shop early and shop local, at our website and store, and at those of our neighbors,” the letter reads. With limited capacities, Mayersohn and Seamonson emphasize on the bookstore’s website how essential it will be to “stretch that in-store ‘holiday bustle’ out over two months rather than two weeks.”
Much of their worries arise from the uncertainty in predicting which new releases will be in high demand. “In a typical holiday season, some book unexpectedly becomes a bestseller and you place repeated orders through the season,” Mayersohn explains. “What we’ve been told by publishers is that we can’t count on their ability to fulfill orders as quickly as they could in years past.”
Mayersohn and Seamonson are not the only bookstore owners facing an upended retail calendar. Porter Square Books has also taken up the early shopping campaign. The American Booksellers Association has gone as far as to create standardized designs for bookstores to use to encourage their patrons to take part in the campaign. Even large stores across the country outside of the bookselling business — like Best Buy, Macy’s, and Target — have shifted their famous Black Friday sales from Thanksgiving weekend to throughout the month of October to avoid in-store overcrowding.
Harvard Book Store, which closed in April in light of the pandemic, was forced to rely on a third party to fulfill book orders during that time. Since reopening, they have struggled with low revenue and rising costs to maintain the store’s in-person experience. Having lost out on the usual influx of tourists and the full Harvard study body this year, the store is hoping that this campaign will help set the business back on track.
“It’s widely known that at retail establishments a lot of annual sales are concentrated in the holiday buying season,” Mayersohn says. “In order to reach any reasonable volume, we have to extend the holiday season.”
For Mayersohn, establishing a safe working environment has meant “doing constant sanitation, putting in plexiglass shields, and limiting the number of people in the store to maintain social distancing.” Throughout the pandemic, Mayersohn and Seamonson have continued to support the store’s full workforce — a commitment that has posed additional costs.
Despite the persistent stressors of operating a small business, Mayersohn has been inspired by the local community’s efforts to support the bookstore. The store’s landlord — Harvard University — has been especially supportive. Mayersohn and Seamonson cite Harvard’s support as one of the reasons why their store has survived the pandemic, compared to a number of their fellow merchants in Harvard Square who have been forced to shut down permanently. Additionally, the store was able to secure a PPP loan, improving its cash reserves.
“Harvard has been a very good landlord to us and, I have to say, the response to the letter that we sent out was really overwhelming,” Mayersohn says. On Oct. 18, the Sunday following the letter’s release, Harvard Book Store announced that they had had their single largest day in sales in the store’s 88-year history. The store’s customers congratulated the co-owners on social media, promising to continue shopping at the Harvard Book Store for the experience, expertise, and commitment of its workers. “It was gratifying and humbling,” Mayersohn says.

If the pandemic was handled according to Martin Kulldorff’s plan, most young and healthy people would resume life as it was before March: no quarantining, no masks, no social distancing.
In early October, Kulldorff — an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School — and two scientists, Stanford professor Jay Bhattacharya and Oxford epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta, met in Great Barrington, Mass., at the headquarters of the American Institute of Economic Research, a libertarian think tank funded by fossil fuel companies and the Koch brothers. Kulldorf had noticed Bhattacharya and Gupta in the news. They were both part of a minority of scientists vocal about their frustrations with the growing consensus around “flattening the curve.”
Initially, the scientists hoped to film an informational video about their views on the pandemic. But after discussion, they also decided to write and upload what they titled “The Great Barrington Declaration.” The memorandum characterizes current public health measures as draconian: It claims that maintaining “current lockdown policies” until a vaccine is available “will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.”
It suggests instead that all schools and workplaces fully re-open. The proposal hinges on a seemingly simple epidemiological principle called herd immunity: If enough people become immune to the virus, it will stop circulating in a community.
The overwhelming majority of experts argue that this approach would not work for the current pandemic — and never has. While the United States was able to eradicate smallpox in 1980, technically achieving “herd immunity,” it could only do so with a vaccine.
Kulldorff, Bhattacharya, and Gupta signed the memorandum while unmasked, and toasted it with champagne. According to its website, it has received 600,000 signatures from concerned citizens and scientists, though the group acknowledges some are fake.
To Lynn R. Goldman, the dean of public health at George Washington University, the publication of the Great Barrington Declaration was irresponsible. “It takes hubris to write anything like the Great Barrington Declaration,” she says, “because it is such a departure from anything that the science is supporting.”
Goldman, along with a team of over 30 epidemiologists, published an opposing letter, titled the John Snow Memorandum, in The Lancet, a prominent medical journal. It condemns the approach described in the Great Barrington Declaration as “a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.” So far, over 4,000 other scientists have signed it.
While the idea of returning to normal life is seductive, Goldman says “there is absolutely no evidence that the population will get herd immunity.” Since immunity from infection with COVID-19 gradually wanes, the virus can reinfect people, which makes stopping its spread impossible. Goldman and her colleagues expect immunity to last only a year or two, just as it does for other coronaviruses, which return seasonally.
On Oct. 12, doctors in Nevada confirmed the first case of COVID-19 reinfection in the U.S., the fifth example of this worldwide.
In contrast, Kulldorff believes that as Americans continue to be infected by the virus despite social distancing measures, herd immunity is inevitable. Kulldorff argues his approach would merely hasten the end of the pandemic.
“In a pandemic, you cannot avoid all death,” he says. “But if you can shift the risk from the old to the young, you can reduce net mortality.”
Kulldorff believes that under the model currently observed in most of the world, vulnerable essential workers are tasked with generating the herd immunity that he claims could eventually end the pandemic. “We are protecting low-risk college students and low-risk young professionals who can work from home [while] throwing the working class under the bus,” he says.
While we wait for a vaccine, the people tasked with delivering groceries, driving buses, and cleaning partially-opened schools bear the brunt of the pandemic.
Kulldorff’s claims identify clear inequalities in the pandemic’s impact, but his solution depends on one central assumption: that it is possible to separate healthy, young people from the elderly and the immunocompromised. But many households include both high- and low-risk populations, family members and loved ones who cannot be feasibly quarantined from each other. This is especially true in the United States, where over 60 percent of Americans have comorbidities which put them at high risk for severe illness.
He did not elaborate on how the government might segregate these populations, aside from taking better care of those in nursing homes.
For Florian Krammer, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine who signed the John Snow Memorandum, “the devil is always in the details.” Even if it was possible to achieve herd immunity, Krammer believes the proposal would be impossible to implement: “You [would] need complete buy-in from the population, and you would need an enormous amount of money to do it.”
The Great Barrington model also assumes that the virus will not harm young people. However, according to Goldman, while young people are unlikely to die from the virus, they can still suffer from long-term health complications. “We are seeing people who have been infected by the coronavirus [who] haven’t had particularly severe acute illness, but [have] wound up with chronic health problems after the fact, cardiovascular problems in particular,” she says.
The Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington estimates that loosening existing public health restrictions could result in, at minimum, an additional 750,000 American deaths.
Goldman is also concerned that politicians could use the Great Barrington Declaration as “a pretext for avoiding taking measures to control the spread of the virus.”
In fact, since the Great Barrington memorandum was released to the public on Oct. 5, it has attracted the attention of the White House. The president’s pandemic advisor, Scott W. Atlas, invited the group to present their thoughts to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar. Azar later tweeted that their conversation contained “strong reinforcement of the Trump Administration’s strategy of aggressively protecting the vulnerable while opening schools and the workplace.”
One of the most effective ways to control the pandemic would be with a vaccine, which would protect the most vulnerable without putting them at risk. “If we could get [a vaccine] to almost all of those who are elderly, who have underlying conditions, we could dramatically bring down the rates of death,” Goldman explains.
While a vaccine would not bring transmission entirely to a halt — both Goldman and Krammer suspect the virus will become seasonal — it could bring an end to more stringent public health measures like lockdowns and strict social distancing protocols
Krammer is well-aware of the consequences of lockdown. He maintains that even now, lockdowns are neither constantly necessary nor good; they are “emergency measures.” He says that by wearing masks, following social distancing guidelines, and working from home when possible, we can similarly tamp down viral circulation so that lockdowns don’t need to happen.
“By taking relatively simple measures, you can completely avoid them,” he says.

As the country approaches its highest-ever peak of COVID-19 infection, Halloween2020.org claims the “delight of Halloween is strong as ever.”
At the website’s center is a map produced by the Harvard Global Health Initiative that depicts county-level COVID-19 data in the United States. Each county is color coded — green, yellow, orange, and red — according to its risk level. The website then provides a set of recommendations for how to best celebrate Halloween according to a county’s color classification.
But beneath its cartoon aesthetic and encouragement to “MAKE IT SAFE & KEEP IT FUN” lurks a spooky spider web of special interests. The website is funded by the Halloween and Costume Association, an organization that represents “just about every costume company in the land” and claims to be “the voice of the entire industry,” and it partners with Hershey, one of the largest chocolate manufacturers in the world. Both organizations would appear to have a financial stake in ensuring that Halloween celebrations take place, even amid a global pandemic.
How HCA, Hershey, and the Harvard Global Health Initiative intersect in Halloween2020.org remains unclear.
Howie J. Beige is the founder of Rubies, the largest costume manufacturer in the world and a key player in the HCA decision making. He says that the HCA is the main creator of Halloween2020.org — but claims that it has made conferring with medical professionals a key part of “coming up with ideas” and developing recommendations.
“It should be a big Halloween, and it will be, but it’s going to be celebrated differently around the country,” Beige says.
Allison Kleinfelter, a Hershey representative in the partnership, says Hershey’s involvement did not include any production of written materials, but the company helped HGHI prepare for media interviews. She clarifies that “it was not an official research review or guidance by Harvard by any means,” but “both Harvard’s Global Health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reviewed the celebration ideas and safety guidelines to ensure consistency with CDC social distancing guidance.”
But Thomas C. Tsai, a researcher from HGHI, contradicts Kleinfelter. He says resolutely that HGHI’s “involvement was just letting them link to our map, and we didn’t have any actual involvement with the specific recommendations.”
The HGHI map of county level COVID-19 data is the centerpiece of the site. It appears just below a playful cartoon of masked children trick-or-treating — one wearing a princess costume and another dressed as mummy. Below the children are instructions on how to read the map. The viewer learns to match their county with a particular “color code” and subsequently to “check out all the safe ways to celebrate and get in on some Halloween hijinks!”
The green zone involves trick-or-treating at houses with sanitary protocols and attending socially distant costume parties. The yellow zone is very similar: recommending homeowners “yeet the treats” to trick-or-treaters from 6 feet away and approving candy shops, parades, and face-mask parties. The orange zone takes a few more precautions but allows neighbors to deliver candy or set up a neighborhood candy hunt. Although the orange and red zones have stricter restrictions, all of the recommendations encourage activities that involve socializing with others and buying costumes and candy for the festivities.
“If you read the recommendations carefully, in the yellow zone it says trick-or-treat, but it says there’s a caveat there,” Tsai explains when questioned about the similarities of the recommendations for the green and yellow zones. The caveat Tsai references is strictly adhering to “official trick or treat guidelines” and “visiting neighbors that have safety measures in place.”
Beige is confident that the green zones are safe and that trick-or-treating is not a problem, as the recommendations are in compliance with CDC social distancing guidelines. “The red zones are definitely more difficult. But I believe any of the other zones… definitely can embrace Halloween,” he says.
He underscores his approval of recommendations for each zone, saying “it doesn’t seem like too many people are saying you can’t celebrate Halloween.” He continues, “We got very good feedback and tremendous support… Our organization has done a lot of research.”
However, Tsai points out that “the CDC rates going door-to-door as a high risk activity,” regardless of safety measures.
It is unclear exactly how HCA formulated the website’s specific recommendations, as Tsai explains that HGHI only provided the website with its map and did not participate in the writing of recommendations. He says that “there’s a difference between data and more editorial content.”
Ingrid T. Katz was the main HGHI researcher advising and collaborating with Halloween2020.org. Katz said in an email that she needed “to steer clear of any more Halloween discussions” and declined to comment on her involvement.
Kleinfelter explains that Hershey’s main contribution to the partnership “was to support final communications and interview preparations for Katz to speak about safe Halloween celebrations.”
Asked whether having candy suppliers like Hershey funding a site encouraging Halloween activities poses a conflict of interest, Beige replies, “I do think Hershey and others really [are] interested in a very safe Halloween.”
Kleinfelter says that the prospective cancellation of traditional Halloween trick-or-treating “was never the issue” for Hershey. She emphasizes that the company planned in advance for the current situation and that their “consumer research indicated they would find creative ways to make the season special.”
According to Beige, the profits would be especially beneficial this year as costume shops are recovering from a tough season of movie cancellations that delayed the release of iconic character costumes the shops had been planning for most of 2020. Beige says that Rubies’ costumes sales generated from new movie releases represent a major part of their revenue model; however, given that most movie debuts have been delayed since the beginning of the pandemic, the industry has taken a serious hit.
Tsai believes that there is no “interference with the actual underlying academic integrity” of the dashboard HGHI provided; he does, however, concede that the information “could be potentially misconstrued.” Tsai says that researchers “don’t control how people use and interpret or misinterpret data” and that it is important for the public to seek out “sources of information” for themselves. Tsai underscores that there are “over 70,000 new cases per day, [and] rising hospitalizations make over 1,000 deaths a day.” He says that the country is “already in a new surge” and that “it’s prudent to err on the side of caution when examining the data or evaluating our behavior practices.”
“No community is an island,” Tsai says, even if the site gives different instructions based on geographic location. “What is your green, yellow, orange, red? The Coronavirus doesn’t respect any boundaries.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 30, 2020, 8:29 p.m.
Believing their ability to live, work, and study in the United States is in jeopardy, several of Harvard’s international students say they are afraid of the prospect that President Donald J. Trump may be re-elected this year.
For Sakiko Miyazaki ’24, a freshman from Japan, her first months of adjusting to virtual college life have been marked by news coming out of the presidential race.
Miyazaki is beginning her Harvard career from her bedroom in Tokyo. She could not join her freshman cohort because of a United States Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Order that prohibits international students from remaining in the country if their course load is only offered online this fall.
Though the Trump administration has since withdrawn that ruling after a joint lawsuit from Harvard and M.I.T in early July, the reversal did not apply to newly admitted international students requiring F-1 sponsorship.
“Oh my gosh, I'm terrified,” Miyazaki said. “And it’s especially frightening I’d say as an international student who's enrolled in a U.S. university who can only come to the U.S. to study on a student visa.”
“With the pandemic going on, like everything's just aggravated and there's just so much at stake that you can only begin to imagine seeing what the administration's been doing for the last four years,” Miyazaki said. “If they are going to have another four years, what irreplaceable damage, in my perspective, could happen?”
On Sept. 25, DHS released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would limit the time period in which international students could study in the U.S. to fixed periods of four years. If a student came from a country with a visa overstay rate of greater than 10 percent, that time period would be just two years.
The proposal, announced in the Federal Register on Sept. 25, was open for feedback until Oct. 26. DHS received more than 20,000 comments, though the agency is not guaranteed to change the final rule or make announcements on it until after Nov. 3.
Joaquin Cortacans Sosa ’23, an Uruguayan student who is on leave for the fall semester, also expressed concerns about the upcoming elections.
“It's pretty scary to think about another Trump presidency and how that might like perpetuate everything he's been doing against immigration,” Cortacans Sosa said.

Administration officials have sought to restrict immigration to the country since the president took office in Jan. 2017. In one high-profile case last year, immigration officials deported a Harvard freshman after finding allegedly anti-American social media posts on the student’s feed; the student eventually made it to campus.
Cortacans Sosa also said a second Trump term would lead to uncertainty over his visa status. The number of non-immigrant F1 visas issued to students looking to study in United States have markedly declined during the Trump presidency, falling by over 23 percent between 2016 and 2018, according to a report released by the Department of State.
“Clearly, like, right now there's nothing clear about how he would want to change F visas, I know he released a new list of countries that are like the visas are going to only be valid for two years,” Cortacans Sosa said. “However, it is concerning to think that he can change, you know, the list of countries on a whim.”
For Guillaume Bouchard ’23, a sophomore from Montreal, Canada who is taking the semester off, the Nov. 3 elections could not be any more important.
“[The elections] are going to have huge consequences on myself as an international student, and I’m Canadian,” Bouchard said. “Canadians have it the easiest by far of international students, and the election is still going to really impact me.”
Correction: October 30, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Guillaume A. P. Bouchard '23 is a junior. In fact, Bouchard is a sophomore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Peter A. Sands — the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — discussed the global response to the coronavirus pandemic at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics Thursday.
Atul Gawande, a surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, moderated the talk, entitled “Catalyzing Global Leadership To Contain the Impact of COVID-19.”
In 2019, donors to the Global fund pledged $14 billion in the next three years to end epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.
Sands said the Global Fund allocates aid “by disease burden, and the inverse of ability to pay” — in other words, to the most impoverished countries with the highest rates of disease. It then encourages the countries to use the aid to independently craft a disease prevention plan.
“We’re focused much more on prevention because you can't get rid of an epidemic simply by treating the people who get ill. You have to drive the prevention side a bit harder,” Sands said.
Based on his experience with impoverished countries and epidemics, Sands reflected on how wealthy countries have grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The reality is that the richest countries in the world have actually spent trillions of dollars in their response to COVID, but most of that has been on mitigating the socioeconomic, domestic consequences,” he said.
In comparison, they have spent only “tens of billions” on tools to fight the virus itself.
Sands said it was difficult to speculate about the possible impact of COVID-19 in the next six months, given how differently the pandemic has impacted disparate parts of the world.
He noted that the response should not be based solely on a vaccine, but also the development of therapeutics and diagnostics to be used in the interim.
“If we lose those healthcare workers between now and when we get a vaccine, we won't have anybody to distribute the vaccine anyway,” Sands said.
This is a particular concern in regions with low ratios of healthcare workers tooverall population, like some countries in Africa, he said.
Sands and Gawande also discussed the importance of systems of healthcare delivery in disease response — both for coronavirus and the diseases the Global Fund focuses on, such as AIDS.
“You've got to build a system, because if you don't have a system, nothing functions,” Sands said. “In many countries, the fundamental infrastructure and capabilities that have been used to do the COVID response, have been those that have been put in place for HIV, TB, and malaria.”
At the same time, though, Sands said it is important that healthcare providers not lose sight of individual patients’ well-being.
“COVID is going to force us to get even more system-oriented,” he added. “But I want to make sure that as we do so, we keep that laser-sharp focus on what is the difference we’re making to people's lives.”
Sands concluded by reflecting on how COVID-19 has shifted wealthier countries’ perspective on the effects of disease — now, instead of looking “outward,” they have been forced to turn “inward.”
“Whereas malaria was in a sense for the rich countries, somebody else’s problem, but one they wanted to help deal with, this is a problem that is on the doorstep of the rich countries in the world,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer-Prize winning Washington Post columnist Eugene H. Robinson spoke about the role of journalism in the 2020 presidential election at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum lecture Wednesday.
The event, titled “The Challenges Facing the Media on November 3rd and Beyond,” was hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center for Media, Politics, and Public Policy as part of the annual Theodore H. White Lecture series on Press and Politics. Shorenstein Center Director Nancy R. Gibbs moderated the lecture.
Robinson opened the lecture by discussing how journalism has evolved to be what it is today.
“It’s hard to remember, but not so very long ago we actually had a set of rules, and a set of guardrails. And those rules and guardrails kept our public discourse more or less tethered to objective truth,” Robinson said.
“Today, our voices are easily and dangerously drowned out on the internet by voices that are not even remotely tethered to fact, and not remotely tethered to actual events,” he added.
Robinson talked about a possible election-day scenario which he called a “red mirage,” in which same-day votes favorable to President Trump are reported before absentee and mail-in ballot totals, giving the appearance of a substantial lead for Trump before official results are finalized.
“Our job clearly is to tell people that this mirage is indeed a mirage, that it might actually turn out to be reality, but we won't know that until more of the votes are counted,” he said. “And we'll have to convince our readers and our viewers to be patient until all the votes are counted. That will be a tall order.”
In reporting political controversy up to the election, Robinson warned against the standard convention in journalism to give both sides equal weight.
“If we know that one side is telling the truth, and the other side is lying, we need to tell people that, and we need to tell them that plainly and clearly and loudly,” Robinson said. “And we need to say it over and over and over again. Because repetition works.”
In light of decreased public trust in news organizations, Gibbs spoke about the lessons learned from the 2016 election and the responsibilities that journalists have in ethical reporting in a Tuesday interview before the event.
“Journalists are much more aware of the risks of being manipulated, of the dangers, of the very high bar for verification of information, the risks of people trying to manipulate the media to cover a certain story or cover a story in a certain way,” Gibbs said. “So it's an even more treacherous terrain that journalists are operating in leading into an exceptionally important election.”
Despite the challenges that journalists face, Robinson said he remains hopeful that journalism can champion the truth.
“We should never be afraid or ashamed to advocate for truth,” Robinson said. “It is a daunting road that lies ahead. But I think news organizations have one enormous advantage and I think ultimately it is a decisive advantage. And that is that truth is our superpower. So we just need to use it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Every Voice bill, which would mandate additional support structures for people who have experienced sexual violence beyond existing Title IX provisions, is pending a vote in the Massachusetts State House.
Co-drafted six years ago by then-Harvard student John B. Gabrieli ’16, the bill requires Massachusetts colleges to conduct climate surveys, forge relationships with rape crisis centers, award drug-related amnesty to people who experienced sexual violence, and designate advisors for support.
Nora A. Gallo — co-director of the Every Voice Coalition, which is pushing for the bill’s passage — said she is hopeful the bill will finally reach the governor’s desk. She also described current federal provisions as “a skeleton of a framework of what survivors need.”
“One of the things the federal guidelines do is create space for state governments to step up and fill in the gaps to support survivors,” she said. “At this point now, we are just waiting for them to take action.”
At an event last year at Harvard, the Every Voice Coalition hosted State House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, who publicly expressed support for the bill. This September, at a virtual coalition event, DeLeo said he is optimistic the bill will pass by the end of the year.
Over the summer, the coalition successfully pushed the bill into law in New Hampshire.
Concerns that the Every Voice bill conflicts with Title IX regulations previously stifled legislative action, Gallo said. Now, she said she thinks COVID-19 is the bill’s biggest obstacle to adoption.
Under the Clery Act, colleges are required to make crime statistics — including incidents of sexual violence — publicly available. Many universities have reported zero or one incidences of rape per year, according to Gallo.
“For the lived experience of a student on campus, they knew that this is simply not the case,” Gallo said.
To supplement these statistics, the bill would require colleges to conduct regular surveys of the campus climate around sexual violence. According to Every Voice organizer Navya T. Sebastian, these surveys are crucial to providing an accurate representation of the colleges’ culture.
More than 100 of the 160 State House members have co-sponsored the bill.
Bradley Freeman — a spokesperson for the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, of which Harvard is a member — did not comment on whether AICUM supports the bill. He pointed to a statement from AICUM president Richard J. Doherty ’76.
“We are committed to continuing these thoughtful discussions to ensure the legislation advances the important work already being done,” Doherty wrote in the statement. “This issue is simply too important and everyone involved wants to get this right.”
Similarly, Antonio Caban, spokesperson for State Senate President Karen E. Spilka, did not comment on the bill’s specifics. Caban wrote that legislators “look forward to engaging with appropriate stakeholders” when the bill makes its way to the State Senate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former International Monetary Fund and French Treasury official Jean-Pierre Landau laid out two potential paths to confront the pandemic’s effects on global finance in a webinar hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School Wednesday evening.
Landau, an associate professor of economics at SciencesPo - Paris and a Kennedy School research fellow, said the massive amount of spending to address COVID-19 has resulted in virtually all nations accruing a high level of public debt, a situation which has “no precedent in peacetime.”
Landau presented two distinct ways to address the economic consequences of COVID-19: a conservative, “alarmist” approach and an optimistic one that sees the current crisis as an opportunity.
Those taking the conservative approach, Landau said, are anxious about the economic consequences of seemingly endless lending.
“They fear and they predict that this will not end well that the conjunction of the very high debt and very high money growth and very large balance sheets of central banks is not going to end well,” he said.
Conversely, Landau said, there are economists who view the economic crisis as an opportunity to revise monetary policy and the broader systemic frameworks he called the “monetary regime.”
“On the other side of the spectrum, you have a whole brand of opinion — we say, ‘Well, this is exactly the situation we’ve been advocating and predicating for decades. And this is an opportunity to create a new, necessary monetary regime,” he said.
Under this “new normal,” central banks and national governments would operate in tandem, rather than independently from one another, Landau explained. He added that central banks’ autonomy from government is a new development, and that as recently as the 1970s, the Ministers of Finance in both France and the United Kingdom dictated interest rates.
Landau argued that he most prudent way forward is to draw from both approaches in a “schizophrenic” manner, enacting significant changes in the present while taking more conservative measures in the future.
“What is needed today and what is needed tomorrow are actually two very opposite things,” he said.
Landau said economic policymakers need to be “as permissive as possible today” to address the crisis caused by the pandemic, but noted that “we need to be very careful tomorrow not to destroy the foundation” of current economic stability.
In an interview following the webinar, Landau said he hoped that through the event and public policy conversations at large, individuals will gain the capacity to address complex challenges while formulating their own informed opinions.
“You have to understand the people who disagree with you, where they come from, what is their opinion, but, of course, you have to stick to your opinion as well,” he said.
Ultimately, Landau said, economists’ top priority will be to stimulate the economy in time to avert another global recession.
“Clearly, they are now very much motivated by the necessity of avoiding a downward spiral,” he said. “In a crisis like this, you really want to avoid the downward spiral.”

Panelists advocated for the decriminalization of psychedelics to an audience of more than 200 people during a Wednesday webinar hosted by Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics.
Over the course of an hour, the speakers debated the merits of psychedelic decriminalization, discussing the safety and history of psychedelics, as well as their effects on people of color.
Mason Marks, a Gonzaga University School of Law professor and Safra and Petrie-Flom fellow, moderated the webinar, entitled “Can Psychedelics Help Save America?” The panel featured University of California San Francisco School of Pharmacy postdoctoral scholar Larissa J. Maier, University of Massachusetts School of Law assistant professor Dustin Marlan, People of Color Psychedelic Collective founder Ifetayo Harvey, and Ohio State Moritz College of Law associate professor Patricia J. Zettler.
Marlan said he thinks people should have the right to use psychedelics as long as it does not harm others.
“The decriminalization efforts are quite promising, particularly in their ability to alleviate stigma,” Marlan said. “People should have the right to alter their own consciousness as long as it’s not harming other people.”
Beyond psychedelics, some panelists also called for the decriminalization of all drugs.
“No one should be criminalized for use or possession of small amounts of drugs, or even maybe sharing the substances,” Maier said.
The panelists traced American drug prohibition efforts back to the 1970s, arguing those efforts were meant more to disrupt progressive social movements than to prevent drug use itself.
“Prohibition was never about the drugs,” Harvey said. “It was about disrupting the social movements that we saw in the 60s and 70s, Civil Rights movement, anti-war movement, and things like that.”
These drug prohibition efforts also hindered research that may have illuminated potential medical uses of psychedelic drugs, according to the speakers.
“In the 70s, we had more than 1000 papers published that were very promising and also systematic reviews that showed the efficacy and the safety of LSD in the treatment for a variety of mental health disorders,” Maier said. “All this research has been shut down.”
Decriminalization of the psychedelic psilocybin, colloquially known as “magic mushrooms,” is on the ballot in Washington D.C. and Oregon this fall.
Marlan called for people to vote for the motion in his closing remarks.
Though speakers generally concurred that many drugs should be decriminalized, some panelists also expressed reservations about unrolling such a policy.
Harvey and Zettler said while decriminalization may reduce the stigma of drug use, they fear it may create a false sense of security for those who may not know exact laws regarding drugs use and distribution, a gap in knowledge that may disproportionately impact people of color.
“We all know that law enforcement tends to trump up charges, especially if you are a Black or brown person,” Harvey said. “They can easily turn up charges from simple possession to intent to sell.”
Zettler said she thinks it is important for research regarding the safety and efficacy of psychedelics to continue so society understands their effects before legalizing their use en masse.
While decriminalization may move society into “unchartered waters,” she said she is curious to see what comes next.
“The questions about how to approach psychedelics don't end with decriminalization, maybe they just start with decriminalization,” Zettler said in an interview after the panel.
Attendee Martha Hartney said she enjoyed the event, calling the panel “stellar” in an email.
“How exciting to see Harvard Law take on the issue of drug policy reform in the middle of the psychedelic renaissance,” she wrote.

Despite more than 1,250 signatures on a petition calling on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to designate Election Day — Nov. 3 — a University holiday, he declined to do so in an interview Wednesday.
Bacow said there are “lots of complexities in declaring holidays,” such as how it impacts federal research funding and “obligations on various union contracts.”
Still, he said the University has “taken a number of steps” to ensure that affiliates have the opportunity to cast ballots.
“We've encouraged our faculty to be understanding of students who need to take time off to vote,” he said. “We've also instructed supervisors to be flexible with our employees who need to take time off to vote.”
Petition organizers and signatories previously said these measures are not sufficient, because they still place the burden on students and staff to ask their instructor or manager for flexibility — a potential barrier to voting.
In response, Bacow said that “people have been voting at Harvard for a very, very long time.”
“Having talked to my predecessors, I don't think we’ve had difficulties with people feeling like they cannot vote because either they’re employed or they’re in school at Harvard,” he added. “I would not expect that to be the case now.”
But 2020 isn’t necessarily comparable to previous elections. Jack Swanson ’22, the petition organizer, has cited the pandemic and record-breaking wait times at polling places as further justification for a holiday on Tuesday.
“I don't think it's a stretch to assume that election day is going to have horrific lines,” Swanson said in an interview last week. “This is not a do-it-on-your-lunch-break kind of thing.”
Nevertheless, Bacow is content with his decision.
“I'm pretty comfortable that we've made it possible for everybody who wants to cast a ballot to do so and I hope everybody will,” he said.
He also noted that “there are lots of ways that people can vote,” including voting early and by mail.
Asked if there’s a candidate he’d prefer to see victorious next week, Bacow declined to respond.
“I've already voted, I've cast my ballot, and I exercise my rights, as every other citizen, to keep my own vote confidential,” he said. “We have an obligation and responsibility to work with whomever is elected and we will try and do so.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University of Washington-Tacoma Professor Michael K. Honey spoke on the intersection of civil rights and labor and recounted his participation in civil rights activism, as part of a speaker series at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies Wednesday.
Honey is an activist, educator, and author of multiple oral histories and books, including an upcoming one — entitled “They Never Can Jail Us All: Repression, Resistance, and the Freedom Struggle, a Memoir and History (1960–1976)." Wednesday’s event centered around the book.
Guided by his own participation in the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s and 1970s, Honey said his desire to better understand history drove him to write his book, which addresses the issues of how racism and war have shaped his life, ideas, and personality.
He explained that the title of his book is inspired by a line from the civil rights song “Governor Wallace” that was aimed against Alabama Governor George C. Wallace and his attempt to enforce segregation at the University of Alabama in June 1963.
“I want to remember how history felt, as well as what happened,” he said. “I feel the urgent need to reconsider history in this more personal way.”
Honey walked the audience through his coming-of-age story, and described how his family became “increasingly radicalized” in the 1960s and was heavily involved with activism and the “Black freedom movement.” During that time, he collaborated with prominent musicians — such as Pete Seeger and Bettie Mae Fikes — and incorporated music into his activism.
“If you read and watched the news constantly, as I did, the freedom movement and the war were pervasive,” Honey said. “I adopted an anti-racism and peace agenda in a personal way through the power of music.”
During his time as a student journalist at Oakland University in the 1960s, Honey became part of the Students for a Democratic Society, a national student activist organization that advocated for socialist reform. His radicalism caught the attention of the FBI, he said, and would eventually classify him as a national security threat.
“The FBI stowed a file on me in my sophomore year,” he said. “That FBI file followed me around for many years.”
Honey also recounted his years after college, when he worked closely with civil rights leaders — such as Angela Davis — in Louisville and Memphis. He argued that the problems that existed 50 years ago are still pertinent today, and that events such as the defense of the “Black Six” — a group wrongly accused of instigating a riot by Kentucky authorities — parallel issues seen today.
“Their case was like today's efforts by the White House and Justice Department to blame Black Lives Matter for police and vigilante violence,” Honey said.
Honey also cited what he said are the long-reaching effects of failed reform by discussing how he campaigned in the 1970s to block no-knock warrants, as part of broader efforts against Nixon’s “War on Crime” agenda.
“This egregious no-knock was survived at the local level, and now we see awful results,” he said. “With the recent murder of Breonna Taylor, we see that police violence still remains commonplace in Louisville.”
Honey added that activism requires long-term commitment, not just temporary protest.
“Protests come and go,” he said.“Organization is required to really win some battles.”

Boston Healthcare for the Homeless’s founding physician James J. O’Connell and Y2Y Harvard Square Shelter data and program evaluation manager Kylie Nassif Blizzard discussed coronvirus’s dire impact on the Boston’s homeless population in a webinar Wednesday.
The Harvard College chapter of the Foundation for the International Medical Relief of Children hosted the event for undergraduates with the dual aims of raising awareness about and encouraging active involvement in providing social services to homeless individuals.
When coronavirus hit Boston in March, both the Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program and Y2Y — a student-run shelter for young adults experiencing homelesness — mobilized to support and protect their clients, according to O’Connell and Blizzard.
During this first spike in virus case counts, BHCHP provided 500 beds at the Boston Convention Center for homeless individuals who contracted coronavirus. These beds were intended to supplement the 124 beds the organization maintains as part of its standard medical respite operation.
Y2Y, meanwhile, has continued to shelter guests while maintaining health and social distancing strict protocols, which have so far succeeded in preventing any infections.
“We haven't had a single COVID-19 case,” Blizzard said. “However, it remains a challenging time and the situation is ever-evolving.”
Shelters far larger than Y2Y face an even more imposing challenge in maintaining social distancing procedures and protecting their guests. In general, O’Connell said, Boston-area shelters have been less successful than Y2Y in containing the virus, confronting a 35 to 40% infection rate — compared to a single-digit positivity rate among the broader population.
To help manage these concerning trends, O’Connell said that BHCHP began conducting regular, universal testing for a number of homeless shelters in Boston in April. They found, upon the start of testing, that many asymptomatic individuals were in fact carrying the virus.
“There was a small cluster in Pine Street in early April. We went in and tested everybody at Pine Street — there was one person who had a fever and maybe 10% of the people complained of some symptoms,” he said of the South End-based shelter. “But then it turns out that 148 out of the 400 people there were positive, so they were primarily asymptomatic but spreading like wildfire.”
A number of shelters were forced to turn away guests in order to maintain social distancing and regain control of the outbreak, O’Connell said.
“The net result of all that is the shelters are much safer, but the number of beds available are very low. And so right now we have more people on the streets of Boston that we’ve ever had,” O’Connell said. “So we’re facing a crunch as a second wave comes.”
O’Connell and Blizzard both emphasized that the coming winter season will only exacerbate this “crunch.”
“We’re worried if the wave is too big, we're gonna have to scramble to create new places for people to go. So we’re scared to death,” O’Connell said. “I think our staff is emotionally scarred and traumatized from what we went through before. Seeing it coming again — just this week — it's really scary.”
In an interview conducted prior to the event, O’Connell expressed worry that the dire situation would elicit a feeling of “fatalism” among people experiencing homelessness.
“You have so little control of what's going on, and such bad things are always happening, and death is ever present out there,” he said of the prevalent mentality among those living without consistent shelter.
Blizzard said that the fear of contracting coronavirus posed an additional, untenable burden on individuals experiencing homelessness.
“We know that if you’re wondering where you’re going to sleep at night, if you’re going to be safe for the next five minutes, what you’re going to eat, will you have enough percentage on your phone battery to wake you up to get on time to work, you don’t have the mental capacity to deal with anything other than your immediate survival,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department has deployed officers to monitor ballot drop boxes and polling locations around the city in a bid to ensure next week’s elections run safely.
The police force is also limiting officers’ time off and increasing the number of staff available on and in the days following Election Day, which is Nov. 3.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said the department has increased its presence due to nationwide concerns regarding interference in the ongoing federal elections and the potential for civic unrest.
Cambridge usually deploys officers to polling locations during elections. This year, however, CPD has taken additional measures due to “heightened concern.”
“Here in Cambridge, we’re not aware of any potential threats or anything along those lines,” Warnick said. “It’s a somewhat tense environment nationally, because of this election and other factors involved, so because of that [we] wanted to ensure that we’re doing everything we can to provide the safest environment for those involved.”
The department is also arranging access to certain resources, including K-9s, if needed.
Increasing use of mail-in ballots this cycle has spawned concerns over when election officials will count votes and when a winner will be declared in the presidential contest.
CPD began assigning officers to polling locations on Oct. 17 — the first day of early voting in Massachusetts. The department also dispatched officers to frequently patrol drop boxes on Oct. 26 after a man allegedly set fire to a Boston ballot box, destroying dozens of ballots.
Cambridge native Zev K. Shapiro ’24 said he was not concerned about interference in Cambridge’s voting process until he read reports of the ballot box arson in Boston.
Shapiro said he understands CPD’s decision to strengthen its presence in the city around the election. He said he believes Cambridge residents — whom he described as politically engaged and liberal — would take to the streets to protest peacefully if Trump declared victory prematurely.
“If President Trump declares that he’s won before he’s won, I could imagine that there’ll be protests,” he said. “That outcome where he doesn’t accept the results, or the results are challenged and end up in court in the Supreme Court, I could imagine the same kind of protests, but you know, I’d imagine they to be very peaceful.”
Cambridge City Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80 also said in an interview that she believes Cambridge residents will react peacefully to the results of the election.
“Do I expect unrest? Yes,” she said. “Not that we don’t have extremes here, not that we don’t have competing ideologies or political viewpoints, but the sense is that Massachusetts is not one of the places that is most likely to erupt in violence.
Nolan cited peaceful demonstrators who protested in Boston this past summer over the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police. She criticized local police’s response to the protests, however, and said she hopes law enforcement will be better prepared to handle protests going forward.
“There was an overreaction on the part of the police in a couple of those instances. That was the police problem, not the protesters’ problem,” she said. “My hope is that the police at all levels have learned.”
Harvard Anthropology Ph.D. candidate Jarrett M. Drake said he does not believe an increase in police presence at polling stations around the country will make voters feel safer.
“I don’t feel safer when police show up anywhere,” he said. “I don’t occupy a body that police tend to treat with gentleness, with care, with concern.”
Drake said people attempting to exercise their democratic rights might react fearfully to a heightened police presence given the history of police at odds with democratic movements.
“Let’s say that there was a ballot question about defunding the police and the police were present,” Drake said. “What it insinuates is that ‘we’re here to protect democracy and protect free speech’, whereas all of the videos from bystanders and journalists for the last however many months and years have actually shown the police are very much there to suppress the speech of certain types of speakers.”
Warnick, the Cambridge police spokesperson, said the department will monitor the situation before deciding when to scale down its increased presence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Architects and academic experts discussed the connection between architecture and democracy in a virtual lecture co-hosted by the Harvard and MIT’s Departments of Architecture Wednesday.
The experts discussed how architecture may serve to promote or threaten democratic systems during the 90-minute lecture. They argued architects should consider their buildings’ impact on democracy in their designing, teaching, and advocacy work.
Mark Lee, a principal and founding partner of architecture firm Johnston Marklee, and Nicholas de Monchaux, a professor of architecture at MIT, convened the lecture to promote institutional collaboration, according to Monchaux.
“We are in a democracy we are building, not one which has already been built. It is in this spirit that we convene tonight’s discussion,” Monchaux said. “In this context, I’m particularly glad for the collaboration across our own institutional and cultural divisions that it represents.”
Lee said he hoped the lecture would serve as a forum for individuals to evaluate the role of architecture in democracy amid the upcoming presidential election.
“At a time when there’s so much uncertainty, particularly about this upcoming election,” Lee said, “we feel the need to have a platform to openly discuss this topic and the roles both architecture and architects can play in our democracy.”
Iman Fayyad, a designer and Harvard Graduate School of Design lecturer, began the webinar by saying she thinks architects have a responsibility to serve the people.
“As architects, our highest responsibility is to design for people. Our actions and decisions do make a difference,” she said. “Democratic architecture is one that actively seeks out and mirrors society’s wants and needs.”
Azra Aksamija, founding director of the MIT Future Heritage Lab, argued that architecture could be used to both empower and disempower groups in society, and to serve as a form of non-violent defiance.
“Architecture, based on its sheer presence and physicality, offers tools for the oppressed to reclaim agency and justice in conflicts that might have already been lost,” she said. “Architecture gives form, visibility and identity for minority groups. As such, it also represents an obstacle for various nationalists and white supremacists in creating their homogenous national communities.”
Yasmin Vobis, co-founder of Ultramoderne, which experiments with new forms of urban architecture, discussed how she thinks physical forms of design can inform democracy as a spatial practice.
“Democracy is a spatial practice that takes over specific spaces, often spaces of the everyday and even spaces that were not intended for that purpose,” she said. “The physical stuff – cities, space bodies – they matter.”
Assistant Professor of Architecture Michelle Chang — who directs JaJa Co, which seeks to integrate film and music into architecture — also said she thinks architecture can impact democratic processes, citing political signage in her neighborhood calling for the cancellation of a high-rise construction project.
“It made me think of the ways in which democratic values and democratic procedures are already happening in the everyday, as a means for architects, designers, and non-architects to engage our built environment,” she said.
Some speakers argued architects should consider democratic principles in their teaching as well.
Rafi Segal, an architect and an associate professor of Architecture and Urbanism at MIT, said he thinks it is important to instill diverse values and equity when teaching design.
“In order to serve and promote democratic values, we need to teach design that allows diverse expressions and equal opportunities to contribute and to shape our public realm,” he said. “The shaping of the public realm, the space of democratic participation, is – as designers and architecture – is our contribution to society.”
Huma Gupta, the Neubauer Junior Research Fellow at Brandeis University, commended architects who extend their activism beyond simply what they design and teach in an interview preceding the lecture.
“Let’s pay attention to these models of activists, architects who understand that it’s not simply enough to try to change the world through what they teach in the classroom, what they design, but in fact, to try to also change the economic, social and political structures in which they practice and teach,” she said. “If we are not committed to that, then it makes it much harder for us to affect any sort of change within the classroom or within an architecture firm or practice.”
Gupta concluded the lecture by noting that the long history of architecture inspires both awe and concern.
“At first glance, this fact inspires in me a deep sense of awe for all those builders who came before us,” she said. “But it also raises a concern of how the foundational myths of the discipline whose aesthetics were forged within undemocratic economic and political systems might encourage an ambivalent attitude towards inequality and injustice today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Design announced Friday it has restructured its Masters of Design Studies Program, raising concerns among students and alumni over how administrators came to the decision and whether the shift will dilute the degree’s educational value.
Beginning in the fall of 2021, students will choose one of four flexible “domains” — Ecologies, Mediums, Narratives, and Publics — and take courses along an individualized and interdisciplinary “trajectory” within their field. The fourth and final semester will culminate in an applied capstone project.
The MDes program previously allowed students to pursue one of eight concentration areas, including Technology, Energy and Environment, and Critical Conservation. Students could complete the program after three semesters of coursework, or elect to undertake an MDes Thesis Project in a fourth semester.
Graduate School of Design Dean Sarah M. Whiting announced the reformed program in an email to school affiliates, writing that the school hoped to counter the “over-standardization of knowledge.”
“More broadly, the MDes program will continue investigating the underlying processes shaping contemporary life, while encouraging a more elastic, intellectually generous, and embracing approach to design questions and investigations,” she wrote.

The school will also move the former Real Estate and Built Environment concentration from Design Studies to the Department of Urban Planning and Design, suspending applications for the track for a year to accommodate the transition.

Friday’s sudden restructuring announcement drew criticism from several students and alumni, who called the process by which the school made the change opaque.

“Basically, as students and alums of that program, we were told very, very last minute,” Hermano L. Rodrigues — a student in the Art, Design, and the Public Domain concentration — said. “We didn't have an opinion or say.”

Second-year MDes student Robert M. Levine said he thought the previous program needed improvement. Still, he said the school’s decision to not involve students suggests administrators did not aim to effectively improve students’ experience.

“If this was a pedagogical move, you would have thought that Sarah Whiting, [MDes director] Michael Hays would have solicited the feedback of those who know the program best,” he said. “That's not administrators, that’s students like us and the faculty who run our programs.”
An open letter to Whiting published online Tuesday urged the school to disclose details of the restructuring process and to consult with faculty, students, and alumni from the MDes program in an open forum. More than 200 students and alumni signed the letter, which also asked the school to list all faculty members at risk of being demoted or removed due to the changesand to reconsider either its decision to eliminate the previous concentrations or the “traditional categories” it chose for the new Domains.
Director of the Master in Design Studies Program K. Michael Hays wrote in an email that the school involved faculty in the decision-making process. The GSD did not consult some faculty members who served as area heads under the previous structure because they are multi-year visitors.
“The changes we have made were discussed and vetted by the entire senior faculty and administration in the School, including those senior faculty who are MDes area heads,” he wrote.

Hays also addressed concerns that the school rushed planning for the new program. He said Design School administrators have been discussing the updates to the MDes program for more than five years.

Izzy D. Kornblatt, a graduate of the Design School who concentrated in Critical Conservation, said he worries the new structure would eliminate the tight-knit relationships formed between students in each concentration.

“I think that's why all the people I've spoken to feel so strongly about it — that we're losing these intellectual families, including the instructors and the students that were coming together around shared interests and research topics,” he said.

Hays acknowledged the new program would shift the social dynamic with the MDes program in a Monday email to students, but wrote that the school is committed to fostering connections within and across its departments.
“We are aware that Areas also have a social function, helping students to establish identity at the GSD,” he wrote. “As we continue to develop this new phase of the MDes program we must and will find ways to establish group and individual identity.”
Second-year student Stephanie L. Yeung said the larger size of the new domains compared to the previous concentrations could reduce the number of resources available per student. One faculty member will head each of the four domains; currently, two faculty lead each of the eight concentrations.
“If we were to keep the same amount of students and have literally a quarter of the same resources, how is that even going to work?” she said. “ They're completely compromising everything while increasing tuition.”
Levine, the second-year student, said the domains do not appear to encompass the array of disciplines covered in each concentration. He said students in his own concentration — Art, Design, and the Public Domain — thought about public space, mediums, and ecology in tandem. Now, he noted, each of these topics has its own domain.
“This notion that this is somehow more interdisciplinary seems to be in name only,” he said. “Actually, in fact, this is much, much less radically interdisciplinary than our programs once were.”
Hays wrote in an email that the domains do not map onto the concentrations, but instead provide more foundational requirements and add a second layer to the curriculum. Trajectories within each domain will allow students to construct their own interdisciplinary tracks.
“The program will be more interdisciplinary than ever,” Hays wrote. “The new structure is extremely interdisciplinary and gives students enormous power to construct their curriculum.”
Still, Francisco Brown — who graduated from the program this year — argued that by restructuring the program into domains, the Design School has failed to realize the “enormous potential” of the MDes program.
“We are really trailblazing new languages and new ways of engaging with design beyond what has been done,” he said. “They didn't give us the chance to flourish.”

The leaves are turning orange, the air is brisker, and Canada Goose jackets are emerging from the closets. It’s everyone’s favorite time of the year: Spooky Season. This year, like many, you may find yourself procrastinating your Halloween costume once again. Fret not, worried one. With these ideas, you can get a jump on the perfect Halloween costume and get back to procrastinating your work like usual.
Hazmat Suit
Remember the good old days in March when people would show up to class in a hazmat suit to make fun of the “pandemic?” Bring back those good old days by shielding yourself from all the negativity 2020 has brought (and it’ll also actually protect you from COVID-19, so that’s a plus). If you play it right, you could also pass off as an Among Us character, symbolizing how you’ve used the game to drown out all the stress this year has brought.
NBA Bubble
Wear a jersey and bring some blowing bubbles, and you can be the NBA Bubble! Bring some humor into everyone’s lives, at a time when we so desperately need it. Bonus points if you wear a Suns jersey and gripe about how they should’ve made the playoffs.
Zoom Meeting
Wear sweatpants and a collared shirt, and you could be everyone in 2020 during their Zoom Meetings! In my personal opinion, we should keep this dress code even after the pandemic ends. Business up top, party down below. Alternatively, just stay at home and say that your camera is turned off.
Doomsday Survivor
Remember when everyone was joking about 2020 being the end of the world during the wildfires? And then COVID-19 came? And then murder hornets came? After that rocky start, it could only get better from there, right? Right??
Presidential Impeachment
Remember the whole drama about the presidential impeachment? Yep, that happened this year, believe it or not. Get a huge peach costume and a wig, and you could be what we used to think was going to be the wildest part of 2020.
Pandemic Graduation
For this one, just wear a cap, mask, and pajamas. Be reminded of all the high school and college graduates that paraded through their living room with their dog, while Pomp and Circumstance played on someone’s JBL speaker.
Stressed Out Online Student
Can’t lie, this one seems pretty easy and effortless. If not, I’ll be happy to come and give you some pointers.
You’ll be sure to impress with these creative costume ideas. Additionally, you’ll also be a helpful reminder to everyone about how much of a dumpster fire 2020 has been. Whatever you end up dressing up as for Halloween though, remember to stay safe wherever you are!

Mostly B’s: “The Basic AF” — Animal Filters
You love the Halloween theme that’s going on, but you’re not a die hard Scream Queen Halloween isn’t that big of a deal to you, even less so online.

Mostly C’s: “The Burnout” — Try the Hat Options/Cool Glasses/Pirate 
You're the definition of “hanging in there.” Sure Halloween is great, but your four psets and two essays are what’s really giving you nightmares. Try using one of the hat and face covering filters — it‘s low effort, incognito, and one less thing to worry about right now.
Mostly D’s: “The Graduate” — Graduation Cap Filter
You're probably an upperclassmen who’s done with Zoom Uni, or maybe just a freshman who knows what's up. This filter is the only option for you because tbh, you seem mentally done with school and most definitely done with 2020, and you’ve probably watched The Social Dilemma too many times. Use the graduation cap because you just want conv(a)cation.
