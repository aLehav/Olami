After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an era when so-called “fake news” is rampant and the Oxford Dictionaries name “post-truth” as their word of the year, Harvard’s commitment to objectivity in research must remain paramount. This objectivity must extend not only to conducting research in a fair manner, but also to resisting pressure exerted by corporations donating to Harvard for specific research aims, an area in which the University has historically been imperfect.
The simplest way to curtail unwholesome outside influences on Harvard’s research is for the University not to accept private funding and to instead rely on the federal government for its financial needs. Nevertheless, given that nearly one-fourth of grants the University received in fiscal year 2016 came from private sources and the increased uncertainty of federal funding under President Donald Trump, refusing to accept funds from all private organizations for research would inevitably do more harm than good. Not every private organization that gives money to Harvard attempts to unfairly influence the ways in which the donation is used by the University’s researchers.
That said, Harvard can attempt to resolve ethical dilemmas it may face by refusing funding from donors that may have obvious conflicts of interest. While this standard of integrity might risk the reduction of some research budgets, depending on the size of the donations in question, it is vastly preferable to producing research of compromised legitimacy and with undermined academic freedom. In more complex situations, if Harvard decides that it is worthwhile to accept funding from a donor interested in a given field, the administration must be forthcoming about the specific ways in which they decide to use the grants.
With this in mind, the primary challenge lies in creating guidelines and regulations that allow Harvard to only accept funding from outside sources if there is no obvious conflict of interest. In writing and implementing these, balance is critical: if these rules are too lax, Harvard’s research will stray from objectivity, but if they are too strict, would-be benefactors will inevitably choose to donate elsewhere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The term “mask of masculinity” was coined by Harvard child psychologist William Pollack to refer to developing boys' responses to the typical social expectations of them, responses that they carry into manhood. According to Pollack, we generally expect growing boys to not get too emotional and to achieve independence from their parents relatively early.
Should a boy show weakness, readily seek support, or even demonstrate intellectual curiosity too often, he may face criticism from parents or teachers and ridicule from classmates. Men have learned to put on a mask to avoid criticism, ridicule, and outright shame. Behind this mask, they can appear cool and unaffected, confident and in charge, brave and happy. How they really feel rarely matters.
For a boy to consistently feel that he is not the person he ought to be raises concerns on how others will view him and tears down his confidence. To feel that he misses his mother on the first day of school but also feel forced to “man up” and hide his attachment breeds insecurity. And for him to live in constant fear that expressing his feelings for someone may lead to both people getting hurt is dehumanizing.
Men put on the mask and try to regain the personal integrity they lose in erecting a facade of confidence by setting out to prove themselves to those around them. Sometimes that false confidence we gain comes from humiliating women by making lewd comments about their appearances, bragging about them as sexual conquests, and otherwise undermining their humanity.
Because the mask often stunts early social development for boys, it drives an unacceptable set of problems by brazenly distorting men’s identities, and, to take a recent example, showed itself when varsity college athletes at the College created sexist scouting reports.
Every time sexism rears its ugly head at the College, through news of sexual or gender-based harassment or violence, I am shocked. It’s hard to understand how men could objectify and humiliate young women who face on the horizon an exciting, rewarding college experience. Often, friends and I condemn this crude language and unequivocally express our disapproval of such misogynistic behavior.
But shortly thereafter, I stop thinking about the matter all together.
Relatively few men make the news for describing women’s bodies in sexually explicit ways, assigning them numbers to quantify their physical attractiveness, or comparing the appearance of one woman to another, though I would guess that many more have verbalized them at some point in a private forum. Many men have worn the mask. I have, too.
That does not make such comments any less unacceptable. I am not saying that the mask is an excuse, that men’s need for help with institutionalized masculinity trumps women’s need for help with femininity, or that men are the real victims. Rather, I am proposing an avenue for change, one whose consideration we owe to women. We should acknowledge the role played by masculine gender norms in undermining gender relations on campus. We should educate all students on the insidious prevalence of these roles. We should offer support for men who feel hidden behind their masks but apprehensive for living without them.
It is clear that there is an urgent need to end sexual and gender-based discrimination and harassment, to treat women as first-rate citizens rather than belittle them. Efforts to empower women and embrace inclusivity in the community have accomplished much toward this goal. Yet we can do a tremendous deal more, specifically by addressing our behaviors and attitudes toward women. The mask has everything to do with that.
With every exposé of sexism, we see the true face of the mask of masculinity. It is a mask men brandish, deny, cherish, despise, take on the world with, and hide behind. Every now and then, brave women who have been subject to sexual harassment come along and muster the strength to hold up an almost unbearably heavy mirror. Its telling reflection motivates us to hang up that repulsive mask and walk away. But it persists, luring men to return to it, to feel its flawless, impenetrable exterior, and to experience the empowering thrill of putting it back on. It is time we came together to get rid of the mask altogether.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You’re 11-years-old when you sit at the computer—the keys too large for your slim, clumsy fingers—and type “am i gay?” into the search engine. You know you have a crush on that girl who’s been in your class since third grade, but some of the guys have been making fun of the way you talk and walk, so you decide to check. But the search results don’t really answer anything, so you turn off the monitor and wonder if the guys know something you don’t.
You’re 13-years-old when you get your first pair of skinny jeans. They press tight against legs of skin and bone, but they’re what’s in and you feel cool wearing them. Self-acceptance, the rare joy you lacked so much in middle school, fills you. When V-neck shirts come into fashion, you feel the same self-love again. All of the joy is undercut when an older relative tells you those are clothes girls wear. You stop wearing both.
You’re 15-years-old when you’re out on the soccer field and your teammates start talking about all the girls they’ve got their eyes set on. They spill the names of those they’ve felt up as you run drills. They talk about how they’re going to smash, rail, and bang countless others. They notice your uncomfortable silence and call you out on it. You take a penalty kick, and then join in, lying that you were distracted imagining all the crazy sex you’ve been having.
You’re 19-years-old when you realize that masculinity kills. You read about Madison, Wisconsin’s first homicide of 2016. A man shoots a woman who turned his romantic advances down. A lifetime of unchallenged masculinity, nearly identical to yours, propelled the bullets that cut into the flesh of her stomach and then her head. It allowed the killer to say that “it was easy to kill.”
And then you read of the first murder victim of 2016 in Greensburg, Indiana and realize these murders are not isolated instances. A woman named Wendy is shot in the back of the head after she refuses a marriage proposal from her boyfriend.  Both women are now among the one out of three women who are victims of physical violence at the hands of an intimate partner. At the center of the violence is a blood trail of unbridled masculinity.
When you fail to question the fathers who claim that “boys will be boys” and that “if a boy is mean to you, it’s because he likes you,” you set up young, moldable boys to expect that violence is okay because it’s simply a part of their incoming manhood. When you police the ways boys fit or don’t fit into traditional expectations of what a man looks, sounds, or dresses like, you give this violence space to breathe. You create a trail that begs to be followed.
Calling out sexism and refusing the masculinity expected of you—on a soccer field, in a locker room, or when you see the abuse in action—may be interpreted as weakness. Not confronting these showings of masculinity, however, is even more dangerous because it normalizes the violence that men commit. It starts with demeaning comments about women passed off as jokes. Initially they may seem harmless, but jokes are the basis for disrespect of others unlike them—especially women.  When these boys start dating, verbal arguments become physical punches and flying hands become gunshots.
Expectations for masculinity—the chiseled abs in advertisements or the stoic, unemotional father figure in most TV shows—subject anyone who does not fall into these archetypes to violence. It’s not always obvious because it takes many forms. Violence is murder but it’s also self-hatred and suicide. It’s poverty and the gnawing of stomach flesh when you have nothing to eat and nowhere to sleep. Masculinity is in part why gay men have higher rates of suicide and why rates of homelessness are so high amongst trans people. Bones break and flesh tears at the ancient hands of masculinity.
Systemic issues of violence and sexism will not be solved overnight, but if we each accept our personal responsibility to curb masculinity, we can make slow progress. This task is most pressing for men, who benefit from the privileges of unchecked masculinity. When we hear things in the locker room, we ought to speak out against them. If a buddy of yours' expletives of choice are pussy or bitch, ask why he isn’t creative enough to insult without dehumanizing women. Don’t be afraid when men around you decide to try on a little makeup or nail polish. Get comfortable with physical affection between men. And instead of wasting your energy telling men how to be “men,” as if there was a single mold for all men to fit, call out every instance where preserving masculinity requires violence.
You’re 20-years-old when you decide to face the reality that masculinity kills. It tucks people into their grave, sometimes quietly but usually violently. You carry the bloodstains on your hands until you decide to break masculinity down―starting with yourself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students resumed classes on an overcast Monday morning, they faced a temporarily malfunctioning online course search tool, a number of overcrowded or filled classrooms, and a few flurries of snow.
The my.harvard course selection website created to centralize students' course browsing malfunctioned for some students throughout the day. Some students reported slow loading times as they tried to find information about courses for the semester; students also said they had trouble using the site at the start of the semester in spring 2016.
“In the end, a server which supports search in the portal reached its CPU limit.  Alerts were sent to the hosting provider's infrastructure team, but the server stopped functioning before the issue could be corrected,” Harvard University Information Technology’s Director of Enterprise Systems Carolyn Brzezinski wrote in an emailed statement.   “The number of CPU's on the server has been increased, which will support us through spring enrollment.”
The lagging website did not slow everyone down, though. Some students had already prepared their course schedule by the time the spring semester Monday.
“I planned everything last night so it hasn’t been a huge issue. Sometimes I wish I could see syllabi,” Carolyn R. Ye  ’17 said. “It will be an issue if it continues not working tonight, because I need to look for my classes for the rest of the week.”
Still, students flocked to a wide variety of offerings, filling classrooms in courses ranging from the humanities to the sciences.
English Professor Louis Menand’s “English 170a: High and Low Postwar America” featured a line of students stretching out of a crowded Harvard Hall classroom.
“It was great that students are interested,” Menand said. “I haven’t offered it in two or three years, which may explain the large turn out.”
Menand said he will try to find a larger room for the course rather than offering students spots through a lottery. In some cases with such large turnouts, professors resort to limiting the number of students who can enroll in a course.
“I don’t want to put a cap on it; we’ll find a bigger room,” Menand said.
Some General Education courses, such as “Science of the Living System 17: Human Physiology: From Personal to Public Health” were also popular among undergraduates. Nancy L. Sieber, who teaches the course with Stephanie Shore, said the course seems to be growing.
“I was really pleased. This is the second year we’ve been offered the year in a newly formatted way. Last year we had 35 students, so we were really delighted today,” Sieber said.
Students who attended the class said they had to cram into the aisles and sit on the floor to make space during the first lecture.
“It was in Science Center E and there were people all along both sides of the stairs and two rows of people in the back, so I would say it was as crowded as it could have been,” Andrew Lee ’17 said.
While Sieber said she is excited about the interest in the class, she added that there are benefits to having a smaller class size.
“I think people get more out of a smaller course but at the same time we want to accommodate everyone who wants to take the course, so we’ll see,” Sieber said.

A blog article posted last week on white nationalist website ‘VDARE’ targeted Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for his stated support of undocumented students, inviting readers to contact Khurana and calling on federal law enforcement officials to arrest him.
The post, entitled “Break Harvard And Arrest Rakesh Khurana and Loc Truong,” also takes aim at Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs Loc Truong. It argues that the administrators’ attitude toward undocumented students was an “open defiance of the immigration laws of the United States” and that the administrators should face “criminal prosecution.”
In November, Khurana said he would prioritize protecting Harvard’s undocumented students at what he called a “time of uncertainty,” as President Donald Trump prepared to take office.  In outlining measures the College would take, Khurana appointed Truong to act as a “point person” for any concerns raised by undocumented students.
In an emailed statement, Khurana affirmed his support for undocumented students.
“As Dean, I am proud to support and stand up for all of our students, and will continue to do so,” Khurana said.
The article also implores readers to report Khurana and Truong to the Department of Homeland Security and the Diplomatic Security Service, providing phone numbers and addresses for two Boston-based government agents. The article also provided Khurana and Truong’s email addresses, calling for readers to contact them directly.
VDARE, a commentary site which describes itself as the “premier outlet for patriotic immigration reform,” regularly publishes articles calling for stricter immigration laws, and arguing that diversity is harmful to America.
In his response, Khurana also said the College values diversity, writing, “every student here at Harvard College—whatever their race, religion, gender, sexual preference, immigration status, or other identities—enriches our community."
The Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes the website as “an anti-immigration hate website.”   Previous articles posted on the site have argued that African Americans exhibit poorer judgement than other races, and that homosexuality is a transmittable disease.
Peter Brimelow, founder and editor of VDARE.com, wrote in an email that the site “believes that legal immigration should be cut back, illegal immigration should be halted and the stock of illegals in the country eliminated.”
“Quite obviously, the activities of these Harvard bureaucrats are of interest to us in this regard,” Brimelow said.
The post, written under an anonymous screen name, makes a series of unsubstantiated claims about the administrators, including that Khurana “wants to make America part of Mexico."
Brimelow defended the integrity of the site, writing that the blogger was “ drawing logical conclusions to make political points.”
The blogger also took issue with Harvard as an institution, writing that the university “hates the historic American nation, White Americans, and President Trump.”
“It will also be a good start to draining the swamp, as Harvard is part of the problem with corruption and anti-Americanism,” the blogger wrote, describing his rationale for advocating Khurana and Truong be reported to authorities.
White nationalist interests have targeted Harvard affiliates in the past.
Last year, when Ron K. Unz ’83 was a candidate for Harvard’s Board of Overseers, The Crimson reported that he had donated tens of thousands of dollars to VDARE.
In October, an email with the subject line “Fight White Genocide - Vote Trump!” promoting similar anti-immigrant sentiment was sent to some undergraduates, prompting Harvard to call upon police to investigate.

UPDATED: January 24, 2017 at 10:06 p.m.
With a year and a half left in its historic capital campaign, Harvard’s alumni affairs and development team will grant fewer interview requests to The Crimson with a top fundraising official, limiting public updates about the largest fundraising drive in higher education history.
Throughout the capital campaign, the University has granted The Crimson interviews with Tamara E. Rogers ’74, vice president for alumni affairs and development, as often as once a semester. During these interviews, she would sometimes detail Harvard's fundraising levels.
But in a change of tack, the University will offer fewer interviews with Rogers about the capital campaign, and it will release updates at the close of the fiscal year. In previous interviews with The Crimson, Rogers also answered questions about qualitative aspects of the fundraising drive. The University last detailed the progress of the fundraising drive in a public update in September.
Rogers responded to Crimson inquiries about campaign updates in an emailed statement Monday.
“Thanks to the generous support of our alumni and friends we have made great progress toward these goals, but there is important work that remains ahead,” she wrote.
Harvard blew past its $6.5 billion campaign goal in 2016, announcing in September that it had amassed more than $7 billion in campaign donations over the five-year life of the drive—a total that breaks higher-education fundraising records. Fundraising officials and administrators are focusing their efforts on a number of individual priorities within the campaign, including undergraduate House renewal, financial aid, and construction in Allston, that remain unfulfilled.
Despite the overall effectiveness of the campaign, University administrators have remained relatively tight-lipped about its quantitative progress.
To some fundraising experts, the University’s practice of making public statements about the campaigns differs from the practice in place at other large institutions. Timothy M. Winkler, the CEO of a fundraising firm which consults on higher education capital campaigns, said the shift could constitute a “new trend” in the industry.
“Most universities have more frequent campaign updates,” Winkler said.
Another fundraising consultant, Philippe G. Hills of fundraising firm Marts & Lundy said that changing communication strategy is a tactic frequently employed by large institutions as they reach the end of their fundraising drives.
“As you get closer to the goal, you want to keep people a little bit more anxious about what the goal is,” Hills said. “It’s different for each institution, but you almost always see institutions do fewer reports as you get to the end date of the campaign.”
Harvard’s capital campaign will end in June 2018.

As part of a community benefits package negotiated with the  Boston Planning & Development Agency, Harvard will spend up to $3.5 million constructing two bicycle and pedestrian crossings over Soldiers Field Road in North Allston-Brighton.
The BPDA approved the disbursement of the funds on Jan. 12, committing Harvard to paying for footpaths intended to increase accessibility between the Charles River parklands and the neighborhood.
“Harvard was proud to make a $3.5 million commitment to support enhanced, safe pedestrian access to the Charles River, and is excited to see continued progress towards the design and construction phases of the project,” said Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
Harvard’s Institutional Master Plan, which was approved in 2013, outlines the University’s 10-year plan to develop its campus in Allston. The community benefits package included in the IMP allocates $43 million to support various projects, like pedestrian crossings, in the neighborhood.
Harvard’s other projects outlined for Allston in the IMP include a $1 billion School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex, renovations and an addition to Harvard Stadium, and a biotech Life Lab that opened this past fall. Around two-thirds of the SEAS faculty is slated to move to Allston in 2020.
The Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation will manage the design and construction of the footbridges, and the BPDA aims to construct the bridges in 2018.
“This is responding to a longstanding desire on the part of the neighborhood to be better connected to the river,” Gerald Autler, BPDA’s senior project manager, said.
Currently, Soldiers Field Road—a major artery separating Allston from the Charles River—is difficult for pedestrians and bikers to cross. “The Charles River is almost inaccessible because there is no walkway across Soldiers Field Road,” said John A. Bruno, the interim chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force.
Beyond improving access to Allston’s Herter Park and Artesani Playground, Autler said the new crossings will also support local businesses.
In 2015, Harvard paid $150,000 for a feasibility study to evaluate potential locations for crossings. The study was presented to the Harvard-Allston Task Force in September 2015.
In December 2015, the Task Force supported advancement with the design process, approving the refurbishment of the overpass at Telford Street and a new crossing at Everett Street.
The study concluded that the $3.35 million remaining after the cost of the study would cover the construction of the two crossings. However, Autler noted that these cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change.
With growth in residential population of this neighborhood, Autler said the BPDA is confident that these crossings will see heavy use.
Galen M. Mook, an Allston resident, said he will welcome the construction, referring to the Charles River as “kind of the crown jewel of Allston” and is looking forward to the completion of this project.
“It is a good project that has been discussed for several years,” Allston resident Harry E. Mattison agreed in an email. “I and many others look forward to seeing completed as soon as possible.”

College administrators and undergraduates recently launched a revamped version of the smartphone application  “Omni @Harvard College,” adding a schedule for food trucks and an “enhanced” shuttle tracker, among other features.
Spearheaded by former Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh '16 and former Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal '16, Omni first launched in fall 2015. The updated application “includes access to gym hours and schedules, wellness information and events,” and “major College updates,” according to an email Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair sent undergraduates Sunday. It still includes dining hall menus, a shuttle tracking service, and athletic facility hours from the older version of the application.
The newest iteration of Omni also integrates Mange, another mobile application used to place grill orders from House dining halls.
According to O’Dair, the application had been downloaded by a majority of the student body prior to the redesign. In her email, she wrote that Omni users can update the application to access the new version.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, O’Dair wrote that nearly three quarters of undergraduates have downloaded the application on a mobile device. About half of those users were “actively using Omni” at the end of the spring semester.
Some students said they were disappointed with features in the original Omni application. Mateo A. Lincoln ’19 said he relied on the app for its shuttle tracking service, despite what he described as its sometimes-unreliable information.
“It seemed to be relatively accurate, although often there were some like mix-ups in the times the shuttles were coming. I live in Currier, so the shuttles are essential to everyday life,” he said.
Others, like Ryan B. Song ’17 said they didn’t use the application frequently after downloading.
“From what I recall, it wasn’t super comprehensive,” he said. “I feel like there’s a reason why I stopped using the app immediately after I downloaded it.”
Alexander Z. Zhang ’20 echoed these concerns, adding that he used the “Harvard” application in lieu of Omni.
O’Dair said student feedback was the impetus to revamp the application.
“Ongoing feedback from students drives so much of what we do, including the evolution of Omni and many of our digital communication resources,” she wrote in the emailed statement. “We knew we needed to move the app over to a platform that provided additional capabilities such as push notifications, enhanced modules such as shuttle tracker, and the technology to allow us to stay ahead of the curve in terms of offerings.”
Similar to its original version, Omni 2.0’s development “was a continued partnership between students and staff,” according to O’Dair. Former Undergraduate Council Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal '16 said the the UC and the College worked together in the original development of the app.
“When I think back to my four years on the Council, I can’t think of any project where the UC and the College have collaborated more than they have on Omni,” Goyal said.
O’Dair said Omni will continue to be updated as students give more feedback.
“We will continuously work with students and staff to evolve Omni, as with any digital platform, to ensure it’s serving the needs of our undergraduates both in terms of content and technology,” she wrote.

Two high school students who hope to attend the College were accepted as amici curiae in the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard last Wednesday, and will be allowed to submit briefs supporting Harvard’s race-conscious admissions processes.
Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts accepted the brief filed by Jason Fong, a high school senior who has already applied to Harvard, and a high school sophomore identified as M. A., who plans to apply in the future. Burroughs’s decision came approximately one month after the two students initially filed for amici status.
The lawsuit, brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, alleges that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its undergraduate admissions processes. Fong and M. A., in their initial motion to join the lawsuit, wrote that they believed they would bring a unique perspective to the lawsuit as Asian American and Pacific Islander students in support of affirmative action.
With their new status in the lawsuit, Fong and M. A. will be joining a group of 13 prospective, current, and graduated students who were granted amici status in Dec. 2015 after the court denied their motion to intervene.
The group of amici curiae—a term meaning “friends of the court”—will be able to submit declarations and briefs and participate in oral arguments relating to certain motions.
“I think our main goal is to say that we support the consideration of race in admissions,” said Nicole G. Ochi, supervising attorney for Asian Americans Advancing Justice–Los Angeles, the group representing Fong and M. A. “Maybe Harvard could do a better job of that, but that shouldn’t be eliminated as a consideration.”
In early Jan., Fong wrote an op-ed calling on Asian Americans to rally behind affirmative action and holistic admissions.
“I don't understand how we ever got the idea that a fantastic report card, amazing test scores, and participation in activities that supposedly show ‘well-roundedness’ mean that we are entitled to admission to our dream school,” Fong wrote.
Representatives from SFFA could not be reached for comment.

UPDATED: January 25, 2017 at 5:18 p.m.
The Cambridge City Council moved forward Monday with a petition that could increase the number of medical marijuana dispensaries in Cambridge.
After lengthy debate among Councillors about the drawbacks and merits of potentially expanding marijuana sales, the Council decided it will vote on the petition—which seeks to demarcate additional areas in which dispensaries can be built—at its next meeting.
In November, Mass. residents voted to legalize recreational marijuana in the state, prompting some Councillors to worry that purchases of the drug would be difficult to control in Cambridge. Some Councillors said they are worried that medical dispensaries could start selling marijuana for recreational purposes in the future, pending state regulations.  
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen said medical marijuana retailers may seek to profit from recreational marijuana sales. Councillor Dennis Carlone said “we have no idea what recreational marijuana will bring in,” adding that approving the petition could create neighborhoods with high concentrations of the drug.
Three medical marijuana dispensaries are in the process of gaining permits in Cambridge. One dispensary seeking a permit is currently under construction.
Cambridge’s city government has debated expanding territory for medical marijuana dispensaries in the past. Previously, the city’s Planning Board has recommended against expanding dispensary zones.
Criticizing the Planning Board’s recommendation, Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern said Monday that adding zones for medical marijuana dispensaries could significantly benefit who need the drug. In December, Mass. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 announced $98 million in budget cuts to statewide health services, which McGovern said could hurt these patients.
“The Planning Board may not feel one, but there is an urgent need for patients suffering from illnesses. And this is even more urgent given the cuts being made by Governor Baker to medical services across the board that help people,” he said.
The Council also heard testimony about developments in Harvard Square. Discussing an ongoing effort by the Cambridge City Historic Commission to halt plans to replace the Curious George store, Councillor Craig Kelley said the Historical Commission’s effort to retain the Square’s historical integrity is futile.
“There is a limit to what we can do to halt the changes taking places in Harvard Square as we speak. What we can do as a council is change some requirements or put caps on licensing but at the end of the day we can’t say there’s got to be a Curious George store here.”
Also at the meeting, the Council approved a resolution to publicly endorse a campaign called “Take on Hate,” that supports protection of Cambridge individuals and families “no matter their religion or ethnicity.”

CORRECTION: January 25, 2017
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Cambridge City Council delayed a vote on a petition that could increase Cambridge's number of medical marijuana dispensaries. In fact, the Council conducted a first reading of the petition and moved a final vote for its next meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three days after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, a coalition of student activist groups rallied in Harvard Yard and presented a letter to University President Drew G. Faust demanding Harvard actively resist the new administration.
Around 100 students gathered in front of the John Harvard statue Monday afternoon, kicking off the event with a chant of “What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!” The rally, dubbed “Inaugurate a New Harvard,” was co-sponsored by Divest Harvard, the Harvard Islamic Society, Our Harvard Can Do Better, Student Labor Action Movement, Act on a Dream, Protect Undocumented Students at Harvard, the Ethnic Studies Coalition, and Concilio Latino.
Student organizers spoke about the threats minority groups face under Trump—and the need for Harvard to take action—before marching through the sleet to Massachusetts Hall to deliver a letter addressed to Faust and “Trustees of Harvard College.”
“Today we come together to inaugurate a new era of student action and solidarity on campus,” students wrote in the letter. “We therefore call upon President Drew Faust and the Harvard administration to embark on a course of action that upholds our community values in the face of a new political reality.”
Trump’s policy proposals have concerned many on Harvard’s campus. He has pledged mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and discussed requiring Muslims to register with the federal government. His nominee for Secretary of Education declined to commit to enforcing current Title IX standards, and several Trump cabinet members have voiced skepticism about human impact on climate change.
Each signatory group makes demands in the letter, including calls for an Ethnic Studies Department, protections and resources for Muslim students, additional support for undocumented students, and divestment from fossil fuel companies, among other demands. It concludes by asking Faust for “prompt, on-the-record meetings to discuss our collective vision.”
“We appreciate student groups bringing a focus to these important issues,” University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson wrote in a statement. “Harvard shares many of the same objectives – addressing climate change, deepening inclusion and belonging across our community, supporting students who may feel anxiety about new immigration policies, and preventing sexual assault and harassment.”
Harvard has already undertaken measures on several issues of concern to Monday’s demonstrators. In particular, the University is providing undocumented students with legal resources, and Faust said she will continue efforts to lobby lawmakers to preserve legal protections for undocumented students currently provided by DACA. The Harvard University Police Department has pledged not to inquire about Harvard students’ citizenship status or allow federal law enforcement officials to enter campus without a warrant.
Faust also created a committee in September to study diversity on campus and develop recommendations for fostering a more inclusive environment for minority students. She has also spoken out publicly about the need to act on climate change, though she has repeatedly said Harvard will not divest its endowment from fossil fuels. The University met its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 30 percent by 2016, and Faust created a task force in December to formulate next steps on climate action.
Ana Andrade ’19, a member of Act on a Dream, said that while some  activists are grateful for the steps Harvard has taken, the University should continue to take action to protect groups threatened by Trump.
“We are truly thankful for what Harvard has already done,” Andrade said. “We’re holding them accountable to what they’ve started… [and] Harvard has a responsibility as a University to do more.”
Organizers said the rally and letter are results of recent efforts among student activist groups to work together in the wake of Trump’s election. Students recently formed a Student Power Network to protest Trump, and several organizers of Monday’s rally attended the Student Power Network’s Wintersession trainings.
“I really hope [the rally] will signal a new age of coalition amongst Harvard student organizations,” Divest Harvard member Mattea Mrkusic ’17 said.
Group leaders say joint efforts directed at administrators will continue. After two students entered Massachusetts Hall to deliver their letter to Faust, activists disbanded, shouting, “We’ll be back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Thomas Wolfe famously wrote, you can’t go home again. Last Saturday, Harvard wrestling flaunted that idiom, squaring off for two contests at the Malkin Athletic Center. The competitions, against Franklin & Marshall (3-5) and later Bucknell (5-4), marked the Crimson’s first home slates of the season.
The weekend bore mixed results, as Harvard (1-4) dispatched the Diplomats early in the afternoon before falling to the well-regarded Bison. Bright spots came in nine places—which was the number of wrestlers who recorded at least one win. Freshmen Hunter Ladnier and Kyle Bierdumpfel and junior Josef Johnson posted 2-0 records.
“We’ve improved a ton,” junior Logan Kirby said. “The young guys have really stepped up and are scoring bonus points. The older guys are really sharing their knowledge and pushing their knowledge. Everyone in the room is working super hard.”
BUCKNELL 24, HARVARD 16
Three bouts remained in an afternoon contest against the Bison, and the Crimson seemed to have Bucknell in a half nelson.
Freshman Kyle Bierdumpfel (165 lbs.) and junior Josef Johnson (174 lbs.) had just won by decision, with respective scores of 6-1 and 9-4. Now Harvard held a 16-12 advantage with the contest winding to a close.
But over the next three duels, the lead evaporated. Bucknell showed up late to claim a 24-16 lead and prevent the Crimson from earning a second straight victory.
“We had some guys in close matches,” junior Rico Stormer said. “Several small mistakes cost us a lot of points.”
Harvard held a lead earlier in the day, as rookie Hunter Ladnier (149 lbs.) pinned Seth Hogue to give the Crimson a 10-7 lead. Tri-captain Jeffrey Ott also triumphed, in his case by a 16-7 major decision.
The rest of the team struggled to find success, however. Junior Kanon Dean wrestled Drew Phipps to the limit but ended with a 3-2 loss. More lopsided were the 11-3 major decision that freshman Conor Sakmar (125 lbs.) dropped and the 16-0 result, after a technical fall, that Cody Knight (147 lbs.) suffered.
In the contest, freshman A.J. Jaffe, Stormer, and tri-captain Nick Gakjdzik also lost. Even so, the overall competitiveness of the score gave Harvard partisans something to cheer, as Bucknell represented one of the more talented programs that the Crimson has faced in 2017.
“We came up a little short, really,” Stormer said. “They’re a good team, but we could roll with them…. We’re just not where we want to be yet.”
HARVARD 36, FRANKLIN & MARSHALL 6
At Marmion Academy in Aurora, Ill., A.J. Jaffe captained his high school’s wrestling team as a junior and senior. He won the state championship and earned All-American honors.
It’s no secret that college wrestling is a different beast. But according to Stormer, the rookie has looked anything but.
“He’s very, very consistent,” Stormer said. “He’s out there wrestling hard every time. He practices hard every day. He’s one of the hardest workers on the team.”
That effort shone through against the Diplomas, as Jaffe was the only Harvard wrestler to pin his opponent. That result led the way in a Crimson-dominated matchup.
It took months of training, three earlier contests, and countless gallons of sweat, but against Franklin & Marshall, Harvard finally walked away from the mat with a team win.
“Every match was really competitive,” Kirby said. “We just stayed aggressive and fought for every point.”
Other impressive performances came from Bierdumpfel and tri-captain Johnson, who claimed 10-1 and 12-1 major decisions, respectively. In addition, Stormer stormed ahead with 16-0 victory by technical fall.
The two losses on the day came in low-scoring decisions. The first-year Sakmar suffered a 4-1 defeat to Edgar Garcia. And at 184 pounds, Dean dropped a second tight bout, this one by a score of 2-1.
The success of other teammates made those setbacks irrelevant in the end. Freshman Zeth Dean (157 lbs.) avenged his older brother’s defeat with a 3-1 victory by decision.
Two other Harvard wrestlers won by falls. Junior Angus Cowell (285 lbs.) topped Core Kerkesner, and Ladnier won by a technical fall to cement a 2-0 record on the weekend. Sophomore Samuel Goldman rounded out the performance with a 6-4 win by decision at 133 pounds.
“We want to win every match we have from here on out,” Kirby said. “We want to wrestle hard, get some good wins under our belt, be ready to go at conference tournament, and hopefully send as many guys to nationals as we can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season has just begun, but for the Harvard women’s tennis team, flying the W has proved to be elusive thus far. The Crimson kicked off its spring season with an Illinois road trip against No. 26 Northwestern and DePaul, going 0-2 in the process.
In the weekend’s first match against the Wildcats (3-0, 0-0 Big Ten), Harvard (0-2, 0-0 Ivy League) produced its lone win at the top singles slot in an eventual 6-1 defeat.  Sunday’s match at Lakeshore Sports & Fitness Center in Chicago, Ill. proved far more fortuitous for the Crimson, but the Blue Demons (2-0, 0-0 Big East) were able to triumph in the end, 5-2.
“I think these two matches were really good to see where our team is at tennis wise and fitness wise compared to the teams we played,” captain June Lee said. “We competed very hard, and there were definitely moments where the match could have gone either way so that was good to see.”
The only Harvard player to finish without a loss on the weekend, Lee continued to build on her strong play from her final fall season for the Crimson. Facing No. 104 ranked Maddie Lipp of Northwestern, Lee powered her way to an easy victory at the first position, 6-1, 6-3, on Saturday. The senior then brought that momentum into her Sunday match, triumphing again but in less dominating fashion.
Harvard’s other veteran in singles, junior Annika Ringblom, did not fare as well as Lee in her matches at position three.  Ringblom played her opponents tightly and earned first-set tie breaks in both contests for her efforts. But after losing both of those early match clashes, the Palos Verdes Estates, Calif. ultimately faded in the second en route to multiple weekend setbacks.
The Crimson featured its freshmen throughout the line-up over the weekend, but results were mixed for the rookies in their first collegiate spring action. Jenna Friedel fashioned the best results of the group, going 1-1 in two contested matches at the No. 2 slot. The better of her two contests —a three-set 6-4, 6-7(4), 6-4 triumph — came against DePaul junior Keisha Clousing, as she picked up the first victory of her career for the Harvard.
Irene Lu, Natasha Gonzalez, and Nika Besker collectively went 0-6 at the fourth, fifth, and sixth positions, respectively. Lu and Besker fared similarly in bouts against their Blue Demon opponents, as both players convincingly won the second set in three-set losses.
“It's really exciting to see so many freshmen in our starting lineup and how much heart they are putting into each match,” Ringblom said. “I am really proud of all seven of them putting in the work on and off the court either playing or cheering on the sidelines.”
In the doubles portion of the two contests, Ringblom and sophomore Sabrina Xiong played the best of the Crimson pairings. The duo finished the weekend with a 6-4 victory over No. 56 ranked Marina Cozac and Patricia Lancranjan of DePaul and a draw against Northwestern opponents. Ringblom and Xiong led 4-3 over Brooke Rischbieth and Rheeya Doshi when the event was called due to the other doubles results making continuing the match inconsequential.
All other groupings went winless on the weekend, which led to Harvard being unable to pick up the doubles points in either of its matches. Northwestern represented stiff competition for the Crimson in this category, however, as it boasts the sixth and 24th ranked partnerships in the nation.
As Harvard heads back to campus to begin the long season ahead, it sees the weekend as a measuring stick with which to gauge its potential and identify areas of improvement.
“The results this weekend show that we are right there hanging with some of the top programs in the country and that we just need to continue working hard in practice and in the gym to rise our level up to theirs,” Ringblom said. “Each match before Ivy's is a learning experience, and we will be taking this weekend as a lesson to make sure we are the fittest team when it comes to Ivy season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time four years ago, Nerlens Noel, a 6’11” center from the Boston suburb of Everett, was shining at the University of Kentucky as a member of the Wildcats basketball team. This weekend, several other residents of the Boston metropolitan area—members of the Harvard track and field team—converged on Lexington looking to leave their mark at the Rod McCravy Memorial Indoor Track and Field Meet.
Several sprinters and mid-distance runners posted strong performances in Kentucky on a weekend when other members of the squad competed at the Joe Donahue Games 925 miles from Lexington in Roxbury. Members of the field team shone at the event, with many posting personal bests.
“The team did incredibly [well],” sophomore Ian West said. “I think this year what we’re doing this year as opposed to last year is we’re setting a precedent to win. People are setting records for themselves and doing well. We’re coming to the meets with the mentality to win and that’s something that’s really incredible to see.”
ROD MCCRAVY MEMORIAL MEET
Sophomore Gabby Thomas led the way for the sprinters, taking third place in the 200-meter, a race in which Kentucky sophomore Kianna Gray took first. Thomas was just two-one thousandths of a second out of second place. The Florence, Mass. native also took 12th place in the 60-meter dash. Senior Jade Miller kept the ball rolling for Harvard, taking third place in the 600-yard run behind two runners from USC. The success for Thomas and Miller is nothing new. Both were All-Ivy picks last season in indoor and were on the All-American team for outdoor. Fellow All-American Nikki Okwelogu was sixth in the shot put and 13th in the weight throw. The women’s 4x400-meter relay team, which featured Thomas and Miller as well as freshmen Karina Joiner and Zoe Hughes, finished ninth of 18 teams in an event that USC won.
On the men’s side, sophomore Myles Marshall led the way, taking Harvard’s third bronze of the day, with his coming in the 800. Marshall set a personal best with a 1:48.17. Freshman Michael Kolor and senior Thomas Negron took the 16th and 17th spots, respectively, with 32 hundredths of a second separating the pair. The top men’s 4x400 relay team took 12th place in a 21-team field. Senior Efe Uwaifo was fourth in the triple jump.
Kolor wasn’t the only freshman to have a coming out party in the Bluegrass State. Classmate Judy Pendergast earned a fifth place finish in the women’s 3,000-meter, an event she was running for the first time as a member of Harvard. A duo of freshmen also posted strong showings in field events. Simi Fajemisin was 12th in the women’s long jump while Hughes was fourth in the pentathlon, the only Harvard rookie in the top seven.
“We’re all feeling a little more comfortable on the team,” sophomore Allison Rabe said. “A lot of us are new to the team and it took a little bit to kind of know how to work with one another and get in the swing of things in terms of how college competition goes. I think we’re finally doing well for ourselves.”
JOE DONAHUE GAMES
Harvard field athletes, especially underclassman ones, shone during the Friday meet in Roxbury. Freshman Donagh Mahon jumped 6’6” to claim first place in the high jump while classmate Anthony DeNitto won the long jump competition. Freshman Gunnar Allison earned a bronze in the weight throw after a 15.91 meter attempt. West blew away the competition en route to a victory in the pole vault, setting a personal record in the process.
“Right now, competition has been good to me,” West said. “Practice has been going well and I feel like I’m in a groove right now. I’m really quite excited to keep that energy going and seeing what the rest of the season holds in store.”
Not to be outdone by the men, junior Marlena Sabatino took home gold in the women’s pole vault while classmate Floriane Kameni was third in the long jump. Every Harvard thrower had at least one personal record on the day, with sophomore Allison Rabe taking 11th in shot put and freshman Martha Kebeh finishing 12th in weight throw.
“The seniors have definitely been helpful with giving advice,” Rabe said. “They do a lot of in-practice coaching. They’re really good because they’ve been through this and know what works and what doesn’t so they’ve been really helpful.”
Both the men’s and women’s teams that Harvard sent to the Joe Donahue Games took sixth place in eight-team fields. Junior Randall Raymond was seventh in the 500 meters while sophomore Liam Hackett took fifth in the 1,000. Harvard’s 4x400-meter relay team finished sixth in a 13-team field. On the women’s side, sophomore Miranda Sadler won the 800 with a 2:17.68.

Love It: Kyle “I watched this whole season in one sitting last weekend and I'm gonna do it again this weekend” O’Hara
"A Series of Unfortunate Events" is the book series that taught me about love, tragedy, and innovation (that’s all there is in this world, right?) I was fascinated by Lemony Snicket’s love for Beatrice, and Violet was all I wanted to be—the original bad b*tch. Other than the books themselves, there is nothing better than Netflix’s new remake of the series. I sat down on Saturday intending to watch the first episode with admittedly low expectations, and I was amazed by the quality. I ended up shooting through all of the episodes because I just couldn’t tear myself away.
I will admit to being skeptical at first. "A Series of Unfortunate Events" was one of my favorite book series as a kid, and I was heartbroken when that terrible movie covering the first 3 books was released in 2004. Like seriously. I’m pretty sure the people who made the movie just looked the series up on Sparknotes because for having gotten the gist of the plot right, it was shockingly untrue to the text. (I study Hist and Lit so I’m an authority on these things and I triple-dog-dare you to fight me about it.)
So, going in with low expectations, I was blown away by how well this show combined Lemony Snicket’s style of narration, the overarching drama of the secrets of the world (including Beatrice and what exactly happened to the Baudelaire parents), and the kids’ daily struggles to escape Count Olaf. From the first moment of foreshadowing in which Klaus can’t understand a Proust quote about grief and he and Violet decide that it might be just an error in translation, I was hooked. Netflix may say this show was made for kids, but I believe the cynical college student who grew up with the books is actually the target audience. Can we take a moment to talk about the cab driver’s lamentations on "Moby Dick" as he drives back and forth from Josephine’s house to the town? Iconic.
"A Series of Unfortunate Events" was clearly meant to be adapted into a TV show, and the fact that they even attempted to make a movie out of it was dumb. Like, that community college in New Haven dumb. But at least someone finally figured it out. The fact that they even tried to make a movie of it was dumb, but finally someone figured it out. There is nothing to dislike about this show other than the fact that there isn't more of it (yet).
In short, the redux of "A Series of Unfortunate Events" is everything we as a society need (but probably don't deserve). At least one thing is going right in 2017.
Hate It: Megan “I watched this whole season in one sitting last weekend and I'm absolutely not gonna do it again this weekend” Ross
"A Series of Unfortunate Events" opens by telling you to “look away”, advice I wish I’d heeded.  I was too blinded by the love I’d had for the books as a child, wanting so badly to find in this Netflix series a better adaptation than the 2004 film.  Admittedly that was what I found, but being better than that silver screen trainwreck isn’t exactly an achievement.  If the movie was guilty of not being true enough to the source material, this series perhaps clings too closely to the format of the books, and it just doesn’t make for good television.
Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are three really smart kids whose rich parents died in a fire that destroyed their mansion.  I feel bad for them, obviously, but it’s hard not to cringe at them when they’re peppering their speech with literary quotes and SAT words (or letting an adult know that they don’t need such a word explained to them).  I have nothing against being well-read (#STEMmajor) but if this came across as a little forced and stilted in the books, it was even worse on screen.
Like Kyle, I too aspired to be like Violet Baudelaire as a child.  She’s smart, inventive, and an overall strong female character.  However, much like the on-screen portrayal of other great female hero of my childhood, Hermione Granger, I found myself hoping I wasn’t as annoying at her age as the girl I was watching. While I thought Louis Hynes’ Klaus was more compelling, Malina Weissman—though she looked the part as Violet—delivered her lines too melodramatically for me to take her seriously.
Aside from that, I just wonder how well this series would be able to engage someone who, unlike me, hadn’t read the books already.  I assume a lot of the children who watch it won’t have done so, and probably not many of their parents either.  It’s like, I get that it’s neat to have so many references to VFD scattered throughout the first season but many of them would surely go over the heads of anyone who doesn’t already know what that means. I get the sense that this TV series was trying harder to appeal to the people who already know how the story ends than to the people who’ve never heard of the Baudelaires before.
In all, this was a pretty disappointing series. Watching this wasn’t the worst life decision I’ve ever made—it was still miles better than the movie—but I’m also glad it came out over winter break and I don’t have to feel bad about giving 8 hours of my life to it.
