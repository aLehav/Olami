For a House with Diana Eck, a professor of comparative religion studies and Indian studies, as a House master, it was only appropriate for Lowell House’s Opera Company to choose “Lakmé” as their 2014 production. The opera, directed in music by Lidiya Yankovskaya and on stage by Roxanna Myhrum ’05, runs from March 26 to April 5 in the Lowell dining hall. Léo Delibes, who wrote the opera in 1882, was one of the many composers of his day to become entranced with orientalist styles and music. Although two of its numbers—“The Flower Duet” and “The Bell Song”—are commonly heard in the operatic repertoire, the opera as a whole has not been performed in the Boston area since 1914. Though the plot is wanting, the production succeeds due to the beautiful score, brought to life by its talented musicians and singers.
Singing truly elevates the show, though many of the soloists are difficult to hear in the beginning of the first act and need time to adjust to the difficult acoustics of the Lowell dining hall. Liv A. Redpath ’14, who plays Lakmé, sings gorgeously with a full, clear voice that reaches to the back of the room. Her counterpart in Garry McLinn, who plays Lakmé’s lover, Gérald, started weaker, his opening in “Prendre le dessin d’un bijou” seemingly rushed, but almost immediately became one of the strongest voices on stage. Only Nathan Rodriguez’s Nilakantha is wanting: as the stern priest, Rodriguez seems only holy, not the vengeful father wishing death upon the British as he is meant to be.
Though there is palpable chemistry between Redpath and McLinn, the best duet moments are captured by the more platonic relationships in “Lakmé,” namely, those between the title character and her two servants, Mallika (Heather Gallagher) and Hadji (Brian González). González’s acting gives life to a small part that often exists only as a plot device. His devotion to Redpath’s Lakmé is clear both in his physical movements onstage and his singing, loud enough to be heard but soft enough to show deference. When Gallagher and Redpath are set with the challenge of singing the famous “Flower Duet,” their duet is lovely—though at times a bit slower than the standard performance, the soprano and mezzo-soprano are completely in sync with each other.
Though opera showcases voices, no performance would be truly operatic without the orchestral accompaniment. While the strings had slight intonation problems at the beginning of the first and third acts, the overall effect is that of an extremely competent pit orchestra, accompanying the singers without overshadowing them. Yankovskaya did an incredibly good job of keeping the singers and orchestra together while allowing the soloists enough artistic freedom to give the numbers real and believable emotion.
The music is beautifully communicated by Myhrum, who shone particularly in her use of the chorus. A challenge that many opera directors face is the placement of a chorus of singers who need to give a scene life without distracting from the music or central action. The market scene in the second act is exceptionally choreographed, with Myhrum coordinating the chorus’s movements with the music in a way that came off as exuberant, not cheesy.
Music, choreography, and acting work beautifully together to bring the opera to life, but their backdrop is not quite as impressive. A series of cloth paintings, changed for each act, distracts from the action on stage rather than enhancing it. In particular, the first act’s stylized bright green paintings of leaves and Hindu gods drew the eye from the actors, who are beautifully (and accurately) attired in neutral colored costumes that unfortunately allowed them to be lost in the scenery. However, the negative aspects of the production only stood out because they were contrasted with the otherwise high quality of the production, which was well coordinated and lyrical, bringing color to Delibe’s vision of India.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that a group of football players at Northwestern University constitute employees of the university, and thus have the right to form a union for the purpose of collective bargaining. This decision overturns decades of precedent in college sports—athletics in US colleges have long been based on the concept of the student-athlete, by which athletes train and compete for their universities, and sometimes receive scholarships in return. 
Though the NLRB’s decision rests on sound legal footing, the formation of unions could potentially create a host of unintended problems. Nevertheless, we hope that this decision will help to place further pressure on the NCAA to reform their inequitable policies towards student-athletes.
The relationship between colleges and student-athletes has long resembled that of an employer and employee, and the NLRB ruling simply formalizes this reality. Football players at Northwestern spend as many as 50 hours a week during the season–this is more time than the average worker devotes to their jobs. Universities compensate student-athletes through scholarships, and then use the services provided by these athletes to generate revenue through ticket sales and television deals–the biggest football programs take in almost $100 million dollars annually. In short, students are paid by the university to perform a service that earns money for the university, which is precisely the role of an employee.
As employees, student athletes possibly should have the right to form a union, but that right probably shouldn’t be exercised for a number of reasons. The NLRB decision, for example, only affects students at private universities, so the formation of unions at those schools could lead to a division between public and private institutions within the NCAA. Such a division could only have negative consequences for the overall structure of the organization. Furthermore, a push for greater compensation of student athletes could force smaller programs to eliminate certain sports teams. Finally, the presence of both unionized scholarship players and unpaid walk-ons within the same team may lead to further divisions in college football.
Despite these concerns, the decision itself will be beneficial in placing increased pressure on the NCAA to reform its current policies, which take unfair advantage of student-athletes. Earlier this year, Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel was suspended for signing autographs for money, even though the university could sell his autograph; four years ago, Georgia wide receiver AJ Green was suspended for selling one of his jerseys, while the university received a tidy sum of money for selling thousands of those same jerseys. By paving the way for increased compensation for student-athletes, the NLRB ruling will hopefully push the NCAA towards a reform of its exploitative rules.
The move to unionize will also help student-athletes receive fairer compensation for their services to universities. The College Athletes Players Association, the union which petitioned the NLRB, simply wants universities to pay the full cost of attendance for student-athletes, since a “full scholarship” is not sufficient at most schools, as well as lifetime medical care for injuries sustained in the course of school athletics. The decision allowing the unionization of football players serves as a valuable step in pushing for these fair demands.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editors’ Note: This is a first-person, present-tense account of the aftermath of a sexual assault that took place in 2013. For reasons of both style and substance, we have left it in present tense.
I’m writing this piece as I’m sitting in my own dining hall, only a few tables away from the guy who pressured me into sexual activity in his bedroom, one night last spring. My hands are trembling as they hover across the keyboard. I’m exhausted from fighting for myself. I’m exhausted from sending emails to my resident dean, to my House Master, to my Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment tutors, to counselors from the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, to my attorney. I’m exhausted from asking for extensions because of “personal issues.” I’m exhausted from avoiding the laundry room, the House library and the mailroom because I’m scared of who I will run into.
More than anything, I’m exhausted from living in the same House as the student who sexually assaulted me nine months ago.
I’ve spent most of 2013 fighting the Harvard administration so that they would move my assailant to a different House, and I have failed miserably. Several weeks ago, in a grey room on the fourth floor of the Holyoke Center, my psychiatrist officially diagnosed me with depression. I did not budge, and I was not surprised. I developed an anxiety disorder shortly after moving back to my House this fall, and running into my assailant up to five times a day certainly did not help my recovery.
“How about we increase your dose from 100 to 150 milligrams a day,” my psychiatrist said in a mechanical, indifferent voice. Sure thing.
This morning, as I swallowed my three blue pills of Sertraline and tried to forget about the nightmares that haunted my night, I finally admitted it to myself: I have lost my battle against this institution. Seven months after I reported what happened, my assailant still lives in my House. I am weeks behind in the three classes I’m taking. I have to take sleeping pills every night to fall and stay asleep, and I routinely get nightmares in which I am sexually assaulted in public. I cannot drink alcohol without starting to cry hysterically. I dropped my favorite extracurriculars because I cannot find the energy to drag myself out of bed. I do not care about my future anymore, because I don’t know who I am or what I care about or whether I will still be alive in a few years. I spend most of my time outside of class curled up in bed, crying, sleeping, or staring at the ceiling, occasionally wondering if I just heard my assailant’s voice in the staircase. Often, the cough syrup sitting in my drawer or the pavement several floors down from my window seem like reasonable options.
Dear Harvard: I am writing to let you know that I give up. I will be moving out of my House next semester, if only—quite literally—to save my life. You will no longer receive emails from me, asking for something to be done, pleading for someone to hear me, explaining how my grades are melting and how I have developed a mental illness as a result of your inaction. My assailant will remain unpunished, and life on this campus will continue its course as if nothing had happened. Today, Harvard, I am writing to let you know that you have won.
***
He was a friend of mine and I trusted him. It was a freezing Friday night when I stumbled into his dorm room after too many drinks. He took my shirt off and started biting the skin on my neck and breast. I pushed back on his chest and asked him to stop kissing me aggressively. He laughed. He said that I should “just wear a scarf” to cover the marks. He continued to abuse my body, hurting my breast and vagina. He asked me to use my mouth. I said no. I was intoxicated, I was in pain, I was trapped between him and the wall, and I was scared to death that he would continue to ignore what I said. I stopped everything and turned my back to him, praying he would leave me alone. He started getting impatient. “Are you only going to make me hard, or are you going to make me come?” he said in a demanding tone.
It did not sound like a question. I obeyed.
Shortly after I reported my sexual assault to my House staff, I was told by a senior member of the College administration that the Administrative Board was very unlikely to “issue a charge” against my assailant and to launch a thorough investigative process because my assailant may not have technically violated the school’s policy in the student handbook. Even though he had verbally pressured me into sexual activity and physically hurt me, the incident did not fall within the scope of the school’s narrow definition of sexual assault.
The policy, published in the spring of 1993, defines “indecent assault and battery” to be anything involving “unwanted touching or fondling of a sexual nature that is accompanied by physical force or threat of bodily injury.” It does not provide any definition of consent beyond the brief mention, in its definition of rape, that a victim cannot consent if he or she is unable to express unwillingness due to alcohol or drugs, among other factors.
I could still press charges in front of the Ad Board, I was told, but they would probably be dropped because my situation did not match the language of a 20-year-old policy. The last thing I wanted was for my assailant to feel vindicated if the Ad Board dropped the case. After two horrible weeks spent curled up in bed drinking, crying, and trying to come to a decision in the middle of reading period, I decided not to open a case.
The school was extremely reluctant to take any action against my assailant without a fair investigative process. In theory, this approach makes perfect sense. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and you cannot take severe action against a student—such as forcing him to move to a different House—without a formal investigation process. But in practice, this works against sexual assault survivors at Harvard. Our policy is so outdated and narrow in scope that it discourages survivors from entering an investigative process in the first place. And without such a process, Harvard will take very little action against the alleged perpetrator.
And so I found myself in the middle of the worst scenario possible: I couldn’t get Harvard to move my assailant to a different House without going to the Ad Board, but I could not go to the Ad Board because of the school’s narrow policy.
In an attempt to comply with Title IX regulation—which requires universities to provide a safe environment to survivors of sexual assault—school officials told me about 20 times that I should feel free to transfer to a different House if I wanted to. At first, this option felt unfair. Why should I be the one moving when I had done nothing wrong? Did this imply that what had happened to me was my fault? Then, the idea of transferring felt utterly disempowering. Moving to a different House would have felt like giving up and granting even more power to my assailant. At last, moving out felt flat-out impossible. I could see myself slowly descending into mental illness, and I knew I would spiral out of control quickly without my blockmates and favorite tutors around to support me. If I was going to go down, I thought at least I deserved to be surrounded by my closest friends. And so I decided to stay.
There had to be other options for me out there, I thought. I got the school to issue a no-contact order against my assailant. I convinced myself that if I pushed hard enough, if I made enough noise, someone somewhere would hear me, stand up, do something.
But no one really did. Confidentiality rules prevent me from revealing most of what was—or was not—done to respond to my report. Ironically, if I were to reveal this information, I could risk getting disciplined. What I can say, however, is that in my opinion, the school’s limited response amounted to the equivalent of a slap on the hand for my assailant. After unsuccessfully suggesting a number of interventions that could have helped me better live with my situation, I eventually got the persistent impression that my House staff believed I was fussing over nothing.
***
There are few things more disempowering than being sexually assaulted. You suddenly and unexpectedly find yourself in a situation where someone else—perhaps someone you trusted or loved—claims absolute authority over your body. You are desperately trying to have your voice heard and to assert control over what is being done to you, but are systematically shut down until you are forced to simply wait for it to be over. In that context, being practically denied the right to decide what you want to do with your story, being told that something with the potential to be as empowering as prosecuting your assailant is unlikely to result in any action, being denied several requests that you think will help you heal—those things truly make you feel hopeless, powerless, betrayed, and worthless.
Seeing how your school officials refuse to validate how upset you are over and over again is equally damaging. When I told my House Master that I was considering an Ad Board process, I was told it was a bad time of the semester, that there would be consequences for my assailant anyway, and that we shouldn’t go through the process if it was going to be fruitless. Shortly after, my resident dean told me that my assailant couldn’t be punished because he didn’t know what he was doing. The resident dean compared living in the same House as my assailant to a divorced couple working in the same factory. My House Master and my dean encouraged me to forgive my assailant and move on. Someone at University Health Services asked me if it was possible that my drinking habits were the problem, because it seemed like they had led to my sexual assault. And always, at the end of those discussions, I would hear the same thing over and over again: “We want you to get all the support that you need.”
I know deep down that all those administrators are not bad people. They want to be supportive, and they really try to be. But they have no idea how to do deal with cases of sexual violence because they have not been trained sufficiently. They use insensitive language, unfortunate comparisons, and empty phrases to avoid any liability issues that could come up. They simply do not know, and, as a result, they do more harm than good when trying to handle cases of sexual violence.
Moreover, these administrators operate within a system that offers little alternative for people in my situation and bounds administrators to inaction because their jobs depend on it. This system is a product of a broader rape culture that permeates our society—a culture in which it is acceptable to blame a victim of assault for drinking too much, in which the burden is always on the survivor to advocate for her- or himself, in which inaction is always preferred, if only to make sure the assailant does not sue anyone for unfair punishment. But that does not mean that we cannot do anything to change the way we handle sexual assault at Harvard.
I might have lost my battle, but I also hope that this story can initiate a serious discussion about the way we want to handle cases like mine as a community. Do we really want survivors who speak up to be systematically shut down if their experience does not fit some criteria for sexual assault written in 1993? Do we really want to let survivors advocate for themselves until they are so exhausted that they collapse into depression?
We need more options for survivors who do not want to—or are unable to—open an Ad Board case. We need school officials to receive extensive training about how to handle sexual assault and talk to survivors. More importantly, we need the school to start listening to its students when they vote on sexual assault policy, and to survivors when they knock on administrators’ doors with a mental illness. The current review of the College’s sexual assault policy is a step in the right direction. But there is much left to be done to make sure student voices are heard.
The last time I met with my resident dean, I told my dean about my depression, and how I thought it had been caused by the lack of validation and empathy I had received from the Harvard faculty. I said that it would be immensely helpful for me to know that my dean, not as a school official but as a human being, understood my pain and empathized with it. I asked my dean to take a step back from the situation and to admit that I had not been served well by the Harvard system. My pleas were met with a refusal to comment and an argument that it was not an administrator’s role to criticize Harvard’s sexual assault policy.
If my resident dean refuses to question the current policy we have in place, then I will. Dear Harvard: You might have won, but I still have a voice. And I plan on using it as much as I can to make things change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
This week, dozens of young basketball players enjoyed their first appearance in the national spotlight, courtesy of “March Madness.”  Good performance in the tournament could lead to the NBA draft and win them seven digit paychecks and endorsement deals. But for now, they are not allowed to receive compensation for their moves on court. The no-pay rule is a great distortion in the labor market for basketball talents, and should be changed to make the college sport more entertaining. 
The young basketball players are awkwardly designated as “student-athletes.”  By requirement, student-athletes must be amateurs, who play basketball only for the love of the game. But student-athlete is nothing but an oxymoron in the college basketball business. Universities and athletic programs recruit high school players and give them millions in scholarships, exclusively based on their athletic potential. The continuation of these scholarships also depends on their athletic status. Meanwhile, the players’ academic enrollment is sometimes in name only. A recently leaked grade-inflated essay written by a football player at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill shows how little academic involvement universities expect of their revenue-generating athletes. College athletics does not “enhance [the student-athletes’] overall college experience,” as the NCAA claims. Rather, a bogus college experience is set up so that college athletics can continue without paid athletes.
The no-pay rule was not a problem when college basketball was introduced, because the players’ productivity did not merit high pay. However, as the popularity of televised college basketball increases, so does the revenue from athletic programs and thus the productivity of the players. The no-pay rule is effectively a price ceiling on the cost of the players’ labor. As the market price for their labor increases, the no-pay rule becomes more distortionary. Consequently, players have increasingly opted for alternatives to playing for college teams. Before 2000, only twelve NBA draftees were drafted straight out of high school. In the six years after 2000, thirty high school players skipped college to play in the NBA. The “prep-to-pro” route became so prevalent that the NBA banned drafting players out of high school in 2006, a move that indirectly saved college basketball from further talent exodus.
Just like other market inefficiencies, the inefficiency from the price ceiling of players’ labor is unlikely to go away with more regulations. A large number of players responded to the NBA’s ban on high school players by competing in college for the new one year minimum period. Since 2006, all but one of the NBA’s top draft picks were recruited right after freshman year. The NCAA’s claim that its basketball student-athletes play only for love of sports is farcical. As the international basketball market matures, players gain more alternatives to college teams. In 2008, one of the best high school players, Brandon Jennings, opted to compete overseas for a professional club rather than for an American college basketball team. He gained NBA eligibility the next year.
For the select few who can join the NBA with or without college basketball, the no-pay rule is a minor monetary loss compared to their future paychecks. However, most college basketball players will never compete professionally. For them, college athletics demand a fast-paced athletic schedule and academic sacrifice. Many are effectively thrown under the bus by the college they play for once their athletic career is over. They do play basketball for the love of the sport, and the NCAA treats them as use-objects.
If the NCAA is serious about making college basketball an arena for those who love the sport, it should allow players to get paid. For the future NBA players, this change will position college basketball as a direct competitor for talents with the NBA, rather than its current status as a talent pipeline to the NBA. Those who want money will choose the NBA, and those who want fame and support from loyal, boisterous fans will choose college basketball. For players who cannot make the NBA, getting paid for their service should not diminish their passion. Rather, it might encourage them to work harder at their passion, knowing that rewarded for their performance and risk-taking awaits them.
We have abandoned the fetish with amateurism in other aspects of our economic lives. We don’t want our surgeons to enjoy cutting people up without pay. Why should athletes be treated differently? College basketball players are economic actors with various incentives and needs, rather than single-minded basketball aficionados. As numerous cases have shown in the past, monetary incentive, not regulation, is the best way to organize these economic actors to achieve gainful employment, no matter the team or league they play for. It should not be a surprise that freeing the basketball labor market will better align the interests of the supply with those of the demand. Fans and players alike will benefit from lifting the price ceiling.
In an efficient and fair market, even mercenaries can be good soldiers.

Twenty years after former United States President Bill Clinton passed the Executive Order on Environmental Justice, students from the Harvard Law School Environmental Law Society hosted the 26th Annual National Association of Environmental Law Societies conference this past weekend.
The conference, entitled “Environmental Justice: Where Are We Now?”, covered topics ranging from the history of environmental justice and progress to social justice to useful strategies for ensuring the prioritization of environmental work.
Two hundred and ninety-five people registered for the conference, with 150 to 200 people attending the various events throughout the weekend, according to Genevieve S. Parshalle, the co-president of Environmental Law Society.
Panel discussions throughout the weekend focused on topics such as food justice in Massachusetts and access to clean energy. Speakers included Robert D. Bullard, the dean of the Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University, who is often cited as the father of the environmental justice movement, and Harvard Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus, as well as a host of academics and activists from around the country.
Cecilia D. Segal, the co-president of the Environmental Law Society, said after the conference that the idea for environmental justice was something that she and her co-president thought would have a broad appeal to the student body and “resonate well” with the community.
When asked about the role race plays in environmental issues during the breakout discussions, Parshalle said that racial justice was a theme throughout the entire conference and is an important element of the environmental justice movement.
“We couldn’t have possibly had a conference about environmental justice without talking a lot about race,” Parshalle said.
In addition to emphasizing the importance of racial justice, conference organizers and participants cited the role that generational changes play in the conference and the environmental justice movement as a whole.
While several conference speakers have had experience in social protests like the civil rights movement, Segal said that the older leaders appeared to be turning to younger speakers to bring the environmental justice movement into the 21st century by using tools like social media and big data.
“It felt like a changing of the guard,” Segal said of the conference. “The older leaders have laid a great groundwork, and [now] they’re counting on us.”
 
H. Curtis "Curt" Spalding, the New England regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, echoed this sentiment.
 
“I think what we’re seeing is a new generation of leadership in the environmental movement that [is] focused holistically on how a community can be sustained," Spalding said.
 
In moving forward with the environmental justice movement, Spalding said that adapting to climate change is going to be one of the most significant challenges the country has ever faced.

Project No One Leaves, a foreclosure resistance organization run by Harvard Law School students, hosted its fourth annual conference this weekend.
 
The conference brought together community organizers, attorneys, and activists from around the United States to share and discuss strategies for defending those threatened by or going through foreclosure.
 
“There are a lot of different ways that you can fight the foreclosure crisis and the conference is a great way for people from different groups…to put their heads together and figure out what we can do about this crisis,” Matthew E. Nickell, the co-president of Project No One Leaves and a student at the Law School, said.
 
Attendees from New York, California, Washington, Illinois, and elsewhere discussed the stabilization of neighborhoods, government responses to foreclosure, the role of banks in the crisis, and other topics.
 
“We are always after a multi-faceted, national housing justice alliance…and this conference is another chance for people to get together to talk about how to do that,” said Steve F. Meacham, the organizing coordinator for City Life/Vida Urbana, a local foreclosure resistance organization, who also assisted in planning the conference.
 
Nickell stressed that the housing crisis has not ended, citing numerous legal claims that remain active and the continued struggles of those facing foreclosure. Nickell also said the crisis has shifted over the last six years as new challenges have arisen.
 
Attendees at the conference noted that the collaboration across various professional and community sectors gave them a better understanding of the challenges each group is facing.
 
“Much of what I found valuable about the conference today was seeing both how my work integrates into a larger picture, and how I can tailor what I do in coordination with the organizers, attorneys, and city representatives in order to have a bigger impact,” Daniel D. Bahls, a staff attorney at Community Legal Aid, said.
 
Project No One Leaves was established by members of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, the oldest student-run legal services organization in the country, and works in conjunction with City Life/Vida Urbana.
 
The conference is one part of the work of Project No One Leaves. The organization focuses mostly on local communities where they help tenants and homeowners, according to David G. Curtis, the conference coordinator and a student at the Law School.
 
“We are out canvassing every weekend,” Curtis said. “We are going out to Dorchester and to Roxbury and to local communities to inform tenants and homeowners of their rights, so that they don’t get pushed out of their homes by irresponsible bank policies or poor government decisions.”
 
As the struggles of those facing foreclosures and displacement pressures change, Curtis said Project No One Leaves hopes to remain a constant advocate for tenants and homeowners.
 
“There is momentum [for this cause], and it should be used to help people who are struggling to just have the basic right to remain in their home,” Curtis said.

A change to the College’s gender-neutral housing policy will likely come before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in May as part of a vote on changes to the Harvard College Handbook for Students, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister confirmed Friday.
The proposed handbook changes will likely include eliminating the requirement that all bedroom doors in mixed-gender suites have University-installed locks, Pfister said in an interview with The Crimson on Friday morning. A vote of approval would turn the College’s existing gender-neutral housing pilot program into College-wide policy. That policy, which eliminates the lock requirement for participating Houses, was launched in 2011 and now includes at least the majority of Houses.
The vote on any proposed changes to the handbook will likely take place at the faculty meeting in May, Pfister said.
“We know that there’s an interest [among] students in having this option for various reasons,” Pfister said. “So part of the relaxation of the policies [has] to do with recognizing that.”
According to the Office of Student Life website, the current policy stipulates that the College “ordinarily” require single-gender suites, but says that it may grant requests for mixed-gender rooms in “certain circumstances, such as to accommodate students with a gender-based need.” These exceptions have been limited to suites with single-gender bedrooms outfitted with bedroom locks.
According to Pfister, all Houses have agreed to gender-neutral housing going forward. While the 2012-2013 Handbook for Students mentions the lock and single-gender bedroom requirements, the 2013-2014 handbook does not.
Undergraduate Council leaders announced at their meeting on March 9 that Pfister had told them that faculty members would likely vote to lower gender-neutral housing restrictions sometime this spring. UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 called the impending vote a “a huge victory for students” at that meeting.
The change, if approved, would come almost six months after 85 percent of undergraduates who participated in the annual UC presidential election voted in favor of a referendum calling for a gender-neutral housing option across the College.
Pfister said Friday that the student referendum “brought [the issue] to attention, in a way,” though he noted that the pilot program was already underway at the time of the vote.
“We’d done the pilot, and it looked like it was working, and in talking to Houses that have some significant numbers of mixed-gender suites, it seemed to be working fine,” Pfister said.
The vote on the gender-neutral housing policy change, which is expected to take place on May 6, would come as part of a single vote on several proposed changes to the handbook, according to Pfister.

Quincy will be the first House not to offer its students free, on-campus storage after undergoing renovations as part of the House renewal project, prompting some residents to voice concerns over the financial burden the policy change might impose on students.
 
According to Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94, the efforts of the House renewal project to increase the amount of common space in each House took priority over storage. Quincy’s recently renovated Stone Hall, for example, once housed summer storage in its basement. Today, however, it features more common space that has replaced the storage facilities.
 
Cooper said administrators wanted these spaces to be available for use during the summer, and, as a result, the College will no longer provide students on-site storage after each House has been renovated. Residents of Leverett House will also lose on-site summer storage in 2015 after McKinlock Hall has undergone renovation.
 
According to Cooper, administrators decided that the College would furnish suite common rooms after the renovations so that students would therefore not need to purchase their own furniture, alleviating the need for storage space. Quincy residents were first informed that they would not receive storage space in an email from Quincy House Masters Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke at the end of 2011.
 
The House renewal project had fully funded off-campus storage available for Quincy residents through the outside service Collegeboxes during the past two summers while the House was undergoing renovation. Harvard will do the same for students whose Houses are renewed in the future.
 
But since the renovations on Quincy House concluded last year, residents can no longer expect Harvard to fully fund outside storage.
 
However, according to Cooper, Harvard has an agreement with Collegeboxes so that Quincy residents may pay for summer storage through the service at a discounted rate going forward. Cooper said that administrators could not find other on-campus spaces that would “logistically work” for summer storage.
 
Although Cooper maintained that administrators communicated the change thoroughly with students, some Quincy residents disagreed. Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Chanel E. Washington ’15 said that she thought the change was not clearly explained to Quincy residents.
 
Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde acknowledged that the change might be “an inconvenience at first” for students, but defended the policy nonetheless. “We recognize that this is a loss for students, but it’s a net gain, and it’s one that will even out over time as each House undergoes renovation,” Cooper added.
 
Quincy resident Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 agreed that students would benefit from an increase in common spaces, even at the cost of summer storage. Still, Biebelberg, who represents Quincy on the Undergraduate Council, noted that some UC representatives “have expressed concern about the financial burden posed by storage now resting on the shoulders of individual students.”
 
Washington said that Quincy HoCo, which previously budgeted about $1,000 for a “HoCo gift,” is looking into the possibility of using that money to fund a storage unit for students at U-Haul or another similar service.

UPDATED: March 31, 2014, at 4:47 p.m.
The Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences raised a little more than half of its $2.5 billion fundraising goal as of the end of February, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote in an email to the Faculty Monday morning.
The $1.3 billion in commitments pledged by donors thus far includes gifts raised during the public phase of the campaign, which began in October 2013, as well as those collected in the previous two-and-a-half-year “silent phase.” 
“I am pleased to say that we are on track for where we hoped to be at this point,” Smith wrote in his email, which was forwarded to students and the rest of the FAS community by Dean for Administration and Finance of FAS Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 later on Monday morning.
In his announcement, Smith also included progress updates, as of the end of February, on the three largest of six FAS campaign priorities.
More than half of the $600 million goal for the “Faculty and the Scholarly Enterprise” priority, which includes funding for graduate fellowships, faculty chairs, and faculty-led initiatives, has been achieved, Smith wrote, noting $378 million in signed agreements. 
Donors have pledged nearly half, or $267 million, of the $600 million goal of the financial aid priority. Finally, nearly 58 percent of the FAS campaign's $500 million goal for its “House Renewal and the Student Experience” priority has been fulfilled, with $120 million for House Renewal and $169 million for international travel, athletics, public service, and other student activities.
“These results show that our Campaign has built momentum, which was a critically important goal for the first six months,” Smith wrote.


He noted, however, that these figures do not represent cash that the University can spend but simply pledges by donors. Most of the contributions so far are in the form of signed agreements from donors, but verbal commitments account for about $70 million of funds raised.
The email marks the first time since the campaign’s launch that an announcement including this kind of financial detail has been made to the community. Campaign co-chairs announced at the October launch that they had raised a little more than $1 billion up to that point.
 
Smith declined to comment on the update. He has not spoken with The Crimson in an on-the-record interview since the launch.
"Dean Smith wanted to mark the six month anniversary of the launch of the Campaign for Arts and Sciences by updating the faculty on the results to date," FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement. "I expect the dean will want to update the faculty from time to time on this and other critical FAS priorities and will be doing so in the coming years."
 
Neal also noted that each school within FAS may share news within their community as they seem fit. "For instance, Dean [Donald H.] Pfister is considering whether to include a very brief update on the FAS campaign progress in an upcoming email to College students."
College students received Smith's update on the campaign on Monday morning after it was forwarded to them by Kirwan.

Salman Khan, founder of the free online education platform Khan Academy, will be this year’s Harvard Business School Class Day speaker, the school revealed Monday afternoon.
 
Khan, who graduated from the Business School in 2003, began tutoring his 12-year-old cousin in mathematics over the telephone in 2004. He has since produced and released nearly 5,000 videos online, focusing largely on subjects of mathematics and science. His videos now reach an audience of more than 10 million users worldwide, according to The New York Times.
 
The announcement comes only a week and a half after the Business School formally announced the launch of its own online learning platform, HBX, which will provide business-focused courses to students and professionals.
 
Khan’s platform aims to provide “a free world-class education for anyone anywhere” by making its resources universally available. HBX, on the other hand, will only selectively admit students from Massachusetts-area colleges into its first offering, entitled “Credential of Readiness,” which is slated to begin this summer. According to the Boston Globe, HBX will charge students a fee of $1,500 to enroll in the course.
 
The announcement was made after a series of clues were released by the Business School over Twitter throughout the day on Monday, including a tip that the speaker was the poorest person ever featured on the cover of Forbes magazine. In January, the magazine called Khan “The Most Influential Person in Education Technology.”

After an outside arbitrator released a report two weeks ago about payroll disputes at Harvard, the University will begin to pay grant managers at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences for their overtime work. Grant managers are responsible for coordinating federal funding for research.
Managers at the Medical School have been eligible to receive overtime for several years, but FAS and SEAS grant managers, like other types of workers at the University, were previously exempt from being paid for overtime work.
“This position was considered overtime exempt as a result of the University's interpretation of the Fair Labor Standards Act,” Harvard’s Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy said in an emailed statement.
According to the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, the decision to classify these workers as eligible for overtime pay marks the culmination of four years of advocacy by the union, which has pushed to expand worker eligibility.
The union requires that prospective members be eligible to receive overtime pay and has spearheaded efforts to increase the number of Harvard employees eligible for membership. As a result of the recent change, 33 grant managers will now be eligible for both overtime pay and membership in the union.
“[Grant management] is a very deadline-driven job, so for the people who have to stay and make sure they get things done, this is absolutely a good thing,” said Tavita Gill, who is a grant manager at the Medical School. She said she does not plan to join HUCTW.
While the recent change will only make grant managers eligible to receive overtime, the director of HUCTW, Bill Jaeger, said he hopes it will catalyze future changes for other workers across the University who are now exempt from receiving overtime pay.
“It’s encouraging to finally have some progress or forward motion on this issue trying to get these exemptions right,” Jaeger said. “We’re hoping now that we’ve found the right formula and right approach.”
Jaeger added that HUCTW believes that there are 1,200 currently exempt Harvard workers who should be overtime eligible.
 
According to regulations instituted under the Fair Labor Standards Act, jobs must be determined exempt on a case-by-case basis because workers have different responsibilities that may disqualify them from receiving overtime pay.
“It seems extremely likely that most or all of the other jobs in question here would be found to be appropriately in the union and non-exempt [from overtime pay],” Jaeger said.
If an employer unjustifiably denies a worker overtime pay, it can face legal ramifications from the United States Department of Labor, which sets guidelines for which jobs are exempt from receiving overtime pay.
Some labor activists voiced concerns that Harvard has failed to properly interpret the guidelines instituted by the Department of Labor.
“The University has not been seen as working in good faith around this issue,” said Pam Mullaney, a HUCTW organizer who worked on the campaign to gain overtime eligibility for grant managers.
Murphy, however, maintained that the University has been receptive to working with HUCTW and would continue to tackle lingering questions about overtime eligibility.
“We are aware that questions have been raised about other positions and we are committed to resolving these questions,” Murphy said.

Herbert “Herbie” J. Hancock delivered his final lecture as the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry in Sanders Theatre Monday afternoon, discussing the art of telling stories through jazz performance and performing a variety of instruments for the audience.
The lecture was entitled “Once Upon A Time…”, a phrase that Hancock said originated from Miles Davis, who used it as a means of inspiration for creating new music and performing old songs.
“[Davis] would say, ‘Once upon a time. So what? What do you say after ‘once upon a time’?’” Hancock said.
Hancock called this phrase “magic,” saying it has influenced the ways in which his jazz music has been composed and performed.
“Performances come in all shapes and sizes,” he said. “We start out with nothing, a tabula rasa. It begins with a small seed, a flash of an idea.”
When performing jazz, improvisation is important, he said, arguing that an existing song might take on a new form given a different set of circumstances.
Hancock then demonstrated to the audience the ways in which original pieces can be transformed in the moment through the rehearsal of his famous song “Toys.” He played the original piece and then altered it for the audience.
He also said that performances offer more than entertainment, and can convey messages about important topics.
“They can highlight issues, such as civil rights,” he said.
After performing for the bulk of the lecture, Hancock offered the audience some concluding thoughts about his time as Norton Professor, which entailed a series of six lectures, entitled “The Ethics of Jazz.”
He urged the audience to take an open-minded approach to the world and to remember the importance of supporting each other.
“Take into account the many sides to an issue including preconceived notions,” he said. “Be prepared to say ‘yes I can’ more than you say ‘no I cannot.’”
Hancock finished the talk by sharing his hope that his lectures inspired people to be more aware of forming interpersonal connections. He said that he wants the audience to use jazz as a common language.
“We don’t have to like everybody,” he concluded. “But we should love everybody.”

Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will discuss a proposed student honor code, the passage of which would require students to make an affirmation of integrity, at their monthly meeting on Tuesday, according to a report from the Academic Integrity Committee obtained by The Crimson on Monday.
The faculty’s approval of the affirmation, as well as a number of other proposals packaged with the statement, would mark the end of a nearly four-year-long process of researching and drafting a potential honor code. Tuesday's presentation by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris marks the latest discussion of the honor code at Faculty meetings, which was previously discussed twice before in the past year.
 
The new policy, which would go into effect in the fall semester of 2015, would require students to make this affirmation at a frequency determined by the Dean of Harvard College, according to the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting.
 
Interim Dean Donald H. Pfister said in an interview with The Crimson on Friday that there are two considerations to weigh when determining the frequency in which students would sign the honor code, a decision which would be made by incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
 
"In particular, Pfister said the decision should hinge on the body of research on honor code affirmations as well as the nature of an individual course and its assignments.
 
Additionally, the proposal before the Faculty on Tuesday establishes an Honor Board that would review cases of potential academic dishonesty. At least half of the board would be composed of undergraduates, with the remaining seats filled by faculty members, administrators, and graduate students who have served as teaching fellows.
 
Undergraduates would be nominated for a position on the board by members of the faculty, staff, or other students, with the Dean of the College making the final selection through interviews.
 
The proposal also recommends reforms to sanctions for cheating and other violations of the honor code, including an option to refer the case back to the instructor for in-class punishment, “to assure that the fullest range of educational responses is available to the Honor Board,” according to the proposal.
 
According to its website, the Administrative Board’s current policy allows the body to scratch a case, take no action, “admonish” a student, place a student on probation, or require the student to temporarily withdraw. In extreme cases, a student may be dismissed from the College by the Faculty Council after a referral from the Ad Board.
 
The outcomes of all of the cases heard by the Honor Board in a given year would be released annually, according to a detailed supplement on the new body provided to members of the Faculty.
 
The proposal also recommends the creation of a another role for students—a peer-to-peer advising network that would work with students in potential violation of the honor code. A student accused of breaking the affirmation of integrity would have the option of speaking with such a peer adviser.

The Board of Selectmen of the Town of Weston, Mass. voted on Mar. 26 to file a lawsuit against Harvard for allegedly failing to comply with the terms of a 2010 contract which required the University to “remediate” contaminated portions of the 62.5-acre Case Estates property it had agreed to sell to the town.
This decision, which Selectman Michael Harrity characterized in an interview as “reluctant” but unanimous, comes after more than two decades of discussions between the University and the suburban town located 10 miles outside of Cambridge about the Case Estates land.
The property, located on near the intersection of Ash, Wellesley, and Newton Streets, was bequeathed to Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum by the Case family in the 1940s. According to the Weston Town Manager’s website, the Arboretum used the land for educational and experimental purposes before deciding in 1985 to begin to sell portions of the land, the first 35.65 acres of which went to the Town of Weston.
In 2006, the University agreed to sell the remaining 62.5 acres to Weston for $22.5 million. Harrity said that after the agreement, there was a discovery of a high level of contamination of pesticides and agricultural chemicals from before Harvard’s ownership, when much of the property was apple orchards.
Harrity alleges that, consequently, the University agreed in 2010 to lower the price to $19.5 million and commit to a partial cleanup of specific portions of the property, which contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, before its sale.
 
However, Harrity said that before the cleanup was finished, the University informed the town that it had found more contamination than it had previously expected in a specific portion of the property and, according to a statement issued by the Weston Board of Selectmen, “did not want to proceed with the cleanup to the full extent required under the contract.”
 
 
The statement also alleges that the University has since made a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer in which Weston would purchase the property as-is for $14 million.
“We met with them to see if there was a common ground we could find to deal with these circumstances,” Harrity said. “But Harvard just said, ‘Hey, here’s what we’ll do, take it or leave it,’ and we didn’t think that was a good faith effort.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University does not comment on matters subject to litigation.
“As we have stated in the past, Harvard University and the Town of Weston have had many discussions surrounding the sale, and the very complex environmental history, of the Case property, and we had hoped that we could reach mutually acceptable terms. Harvard remains committed to responsible stewardship of the property,” the statement read.
Harrity said that the Board of Selectmen ultimately hopes that the University will agree to abide by the 2010 proposal.

Sometimes in a matchup of David and Goliath, the big guy comes out on top.
Boston College had nothing to stop the Harvard women’s rugby team as the Crimson (7-3) cruised to a 105-0 routing of the Eagles at Cumnock Field on Saturday afternoon.
“We took the [game as an] opportunity to work on a lot of things,” co-captain Ali Haber said. “Some of them went really well, and some didn’t go as well as we would have hoped. There were some awesome things about the game, and there were some drawbacks, which would not necessarily be apparent from the score.”
Less than two minutes into the contest, junior Lenica Morales-Valenzuela put Harvard up, 5-0. Possessions later, classmate Cheta Emba added back-to-back scores of her own, and the varsity squad found itself up, 17-0, against its club opponent with less than 10 minutes gone by.
Co-captain Xanni Brown scored twice within the span of three minutes, and conversions on both tries by senior Shelby Lin ran the score up to 31-0, still within the first 20 minutes of the contest.
Boston College could barely muster its offense past midfield, as the Harvard defense squandered much of its momentum. The Crimson added another try when sophomore Lydia Burns scored off a pass from Brown. Emba added two more scores for a total of four tries in the first half. In the final minute of the first frame, freshman Caroline Park ran in a try—the first score of her Harvard career—to give the Crimson a 60-0 advantage going into intermission.
Heading into the break with such a large lead, Harvard coach Sue Parker nonetheless emphasized the importance of sticking to the game plan and executing at the point of contact.
“Our standards for our own play should be absolute,” Parker said. “The team understands that the standards of our play and our performance are absolute and shouldn’t suffer, whether we are winning by 60 points or losing by the same margin…. It’s easy to play down to an opponent, but for us to be the type of team we aspire to be, we can never let that happen.”
In the final forty minutes of play, Harvard continued to mount its offensive charge, while working on improving its defensive play as well.
“One thing we did work on a lot and approve on was our aggression on offense,” Haber said. “That was a point of improvement for us, and we did a pretty good job of working on blowing through their defense. But the other thing we needed to work on was explosive defense, and…we could have taken better advantage of [this] game to work on that more."
The Crimson also used the contest as an opportunity to give its rookies some valuable playing time.
“We could not be more happy with how [the freshmen] played, and not only how they played, but the time they got on the field [against the Eagles],” Parker said. “They were absolutely great being thrown into a varsity-level game like that, many of who had not had a lot of previous minutes in live-game situations. We are extremely pleased with how the freshmen played on the day, and that bodes well for us going forward through the season and in the future as well.”
Freshmen Claire Collins and Mariah Turner both registered their first tries for the Crimson on Saturday.
Parker also praised the efforts of rookies Maryssa Barron and Gabrielle Wilson amongst the forwards.
“[They] really helped out in the forwards with their extreme work ethic and productive work in supporting ball carriers and being ball carriers themselves,” Parker said.
By the end of regulation, Harvard had amassed its largest margin of victory of the season, surpassing the previous mark of an 84-0 routing of Yale last fall. But even with the dominant win, Parker noted some shortcomings that will need to be addressed before the Crimson hits the road to take on a very different opponent, No. 1 Penn State, in less than a week.
“I was pleased that we made some improvements at the point of contact, [but] on the other hand, we didn’t do it as consistently as I would have liked across the entire 80-minute game,” Parker said. “That’s a point of improvement for us going into next weekend.”

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (5-4, 2-0 Ivy) struggled throughout its game against third-ranked Duke (9-2, 2-1 ACC) on Saturday, falling behind early and never getting a shot to come back.
The Crimson came into the game riding momentum from a strong win over Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth, looking to improve its resume as NCAA tournament selection approaches.
Unfortunately for Harvard, the Blue Devils came ready to play from the outset at Koskinen Stadium, jumping out to an early lead and continuing on to win, 17-11.
“In order to win this game, we were going to have to be absolutely outstanding,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “And that wasn’t the case. We were on our heels a lot, especially defensively, and we just didn’t play our best game.”
Duke managed to score only eight seconds into the game taking an easy lead, but the Crimson bounced back quickly. Only a minute later, sophomore midfielder Sean McDonagh scored to tie the game, assisted by classmate attackman Devin Dwyer. Four minutes later, Dwyer assisted the Crimson’s leading scorer and sophomore attackman Will Walker to put Harvard up by one and looking to extend its lead.
But from there, it was all Duke.
First, attackman Christian Walsh scored with just over eight minutes remaining in the quarter. Then, following a Harvard penalty, attackman Jordan Wolf capitalized on the man-up opportunity. Walsh then scored again, followed by another extra-man goal for Duke, scored by midfielder Myles Jones. Jones’s tally gave the Blue Devils a 5-2 lead.
“We got outplayed, particularly in the possession game,” Wojcik said. “Lacrosse is a game of spurts of momentum. It is tough to come back when we would score, but then lose the faceoff and not get a chance to rest our defense, but when they would score, they’d usually get another chance to keep going.”
Senior midfielder Daniel Eipp answered for the Crimson off another assist from Dwyer, to end Duke’s five-goal run, but the damage had already been done. Harvard would be unable to keep up with the Blue Devils for the rest of the game.
The onslaught resumed quickly, as Wolf and Jones scored once and twice respectively, followed by a score from attackman Case Matheis to put Duke up by six goals with only three minutes left in the first half.
“Against a team like that we couldn’t afford to make any mistakes,” co-captain Joe Petrucci said. “We couldn’t seem to get anything to click, and everything they did worked out.”
Walker managed to score for the Crimson off an assist from sophomore defenseman Stephen Jahelka, but Walsh quickly responded for the Blue Devils with only eight seconds remaining in the half to put his team up, 10-4, heading into the break.
By halftime, Harvard had been thoroughly dominated by its opponent. Harvard had taken 12 shots to Duke’s 25, had gone 5-15 on faceoffs, and was losing the ground ball battle, 13-17. The Crimson had also committed two more penalties than the Blue Devils, both of which resulted in scores.
Whereas Harvard’s four goals were all assisted, Duke was relying on superior individual skills to score. Only two of the team’s ten goals were assisted, as the Blue Devil scorers were able to beat their defenders by themselves and draw extra defenders to create easy chances.
“A number of their goals came from drawing us into a slide, then passing the ball around for an easy dodge on the back side,” Wojcik said. “We weren’t really able to defend the ball well on some of those plays.”
In the second half, the Crimson was able to keep pace with Duke, but was never able to gain any ground. The teams alternated goals through the third quarter, as Dwyer, Walker, and sophomore attackman Ian Ardrey notched scores for Harvard, each of which was preceded by a Duke goal.
The Blue Devils then opened up the fourth quarter with three straight goals to effectively ice the match at 16-7 with seven minutes remaining. Before the game could end, however, co-captain Peter Schwartz scored twice, as well as Walker again for his fourth goal, and junior midfielder Murphy Vandervelde.
Schwartz finished with two goals and two assists and Dwyer tallied one goal and three assists, joining Walker on top for the Crimson with four points.
“This was a missed opportunity for us to get a top five win and move us into a position for an at large birth,” Wojcik said. “But either way, we play some of the best teams in the country, and that will help us play our best lacrosse down the stretch.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the opening game of its conference season and its first match played on the East Coast since spring break, the Harvard women’s water polo team was able to fight to a victory against George Washington.
The Crimson (12-13, 1-0 CWPA South) outpaced the Colonials (9-12, 0-2), 10-8, on Saturday in the nation’s capital.
Sophomore Yoshi Andersen led the Harvard offense with six goals in the game, pacing the team throughout the match toward the victory. When the George Washington defense shifted in order to cover Andersen and smother her scoring ability, senior Shayna Price came up with two crucial goals for the Crimson.
“With our offense, you get a lot of movement, and we do a lot to move people around so if the defense picks one person to stop, that person is going to have an opportunity,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “Yoshi is a very talented player… She exploded early and kept getting open and putting those shots away.”
Andersen leads the team with 53 goals on the season. She also leads Harvard in assists, recording 26 so far this year.
“[Being successful] is definitely about being mentally prepared and being completely immersed in the game by not letting anything distract you,” Andersen said. “Everybody needs to be running on all cylinders for anybody to be scoring goals because everyone needs to be on the same page, and that helps us a lot to score.”
The game started out in tight competition with the Crimson taking a slim 3-2 lead in the first quarter after two quick goals by Andersen. The Colonials countered with three goals, but Harvard answered and was up two goals at the half.
Both Harvard and George Washington recorded three goals in the third quarter, allowing the Crimson to keeps its lead, but the Colonials were knocking on the door, scoring back to back goals and coming within one with less than eight minutes remaining in the match.
“Our defense is a little bit lacking still,” Andersen said. “We still don’t get back to help others when one of the players on the other team beats us. Sometimes we are a little bit late getting to the ball, which allows the other team extra time to get composed and ultimately score on us.”
With Harvard’s lead shrunken down to one goal, Price came up with the final goal of the game to give the Crimson the cushion that would ultimately seal the victory.
Freshmen Melissa Balding and Zoe Osborne rounded out the rest of Harvard’s offense, adding a goal apiece. Balding led the team in steals with three, followed by classmate Michelle Martinelli who had two takeaways throughout the competition.
Martinelli and Osborne topped the assists for the team on the day, each aiding two goals. Freshman Lexi Del Toro, Balding, and junior Victoria Frager also all had an assist.
Junior Ariel Dukes started in goal and remained between the poles for all 32 minutes of competition, recording seven saves. Dukes has accumulated 166 saves this season, leading the team in starts in goal and saves this year.
This was the Crimson’s first game back from its spring break trip to California in which the team went 3-7.
“I think we did a really good job of pressing,” Andersen said. “We encountered a lot of hard pressing teams while we were in California, so we tried to bring the same intensity that we came up against in California. I think we were a little more patient [Saturday] than we have been in the past which we really needed to be careful about in California because those teams were very fast and strong.”
Saturday’s game also marked the opening of the conference season for the team, which has increased its importance this year because teams must now qualify to reach the Eastern Divisional Championships as opposed to receiving an automatic bid as has been the case in previous years.
“We have been talking all year about getting experience and building on our play,” Minnis said. “In the first part of our season we were looking at getting on the same page and working together. Now we are really working hard at getting better….everything is a process, and I think we accomplished that first step yesterday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a successful fall season and an offseason filled with long practices and indoor training, the third-ranked Harvard-Radcliffe lightweight crew squad returned to the familiar waters of the Charles River to open its season against Boston University and MIT at the annual Beanpot Regatta.
The Black and White, which won the regatta last year, defended its title with victories by the first varsity and second varsity eight against the local adversaries. The third varsity eight and novice four also turned in solid performances, placing second in their respective races.
“It was really exciting [to win], and it bodes well for future races,” said sophomore Gabbie Giugliano, coxswain of the second varsity eight boat. ”Since the river has been frozen, it’s nice to go back out there and win because it means all the hard work during the winter has paid off.”
Unlike the fall races, such as the three-mile Head of the Charles that tend to cover longer distances, the Beanpot is a sprint race in which teams start at the Harvard Bridge and cover a 2000-meter span.
Despite the race being a distance shorter than what the team prepares for in the fall, the offseason provided a platform to prepare the Black and White.
“The long winter was a blessing in disguise,” said junior co-captain Andrea Linares, stroke of the second varsity eight boat. “We were able to use those months to really prepare for longer pieces than the [2000-meters], so were able to perform very well.”
Harvard’s first varsity eight kicked off the competition with a convincing win, which saw the boat lead the race from start to finish. The Black and White crossed the finish line with a time of 6:46.7, a full eight seconds ahead of the second-place Terriers crew. The Engineers would check in almost half a minute later with a time of 7:15.4.
The second varsity eight followed up its teammate’s victory with a triumph of its own, clocking in at 7:03.5, 6.5 seconds faster than BU, which completed the race in 7:10.0. MIT would once again finish at the tail end of the sprint with a time of 7:33.0.
The race saw the Radcliffe crew shoot out past MIT at the start of the race before using a strong surge at the 300-meter mark to gain momentum and take control early on in the race. Another push near the halfway point allowed the team to take full command of the race.
“A big turning point was at the Mass Ave Bridge near the 1000 [meter] mark,” Linares said. “We really rowed together, had a solid groove and we were able to pull away from them.”
The third race of the morning saw the Black and White barely fail to continue its winning streak, with the third varsity eight losing a close race to BU. The Terriers edged out Harvard by a half length, finishing with a time of 7:19.6, just 1.1 seconds ahead of the Black and White.
The novice four race followed a similar story, with Harvard once again losing the race by a half-length to MIT. The Engineers clocked in at 8:32.1 while Harvard followed 1.4 seconds later at 8:33.5.
The success which the team experienced in the fall helped build the motivation and confidence which Harvard hopes to use for a successful spring season.
“HOCR gave us a huge confidence boost,” Giugliano said. “That was a high pressure situation where we had to test ourselves against some of the best team. Being able to do so well showed us that we were a fast team…. Because the races were all so close, it made us excited to train hard and take as many names as we can in future races.”
Despite the success of Saturday morning, the team felt that there are still many steps which can be taken to assure that the Black and White continues its winning ways.
“There are always areas that the team can work on,” Linares said. “One of the thing that we’ll need to get down is our surge…. We just haven’t had enough time on the water to solidify that surge. Our sprint can also be improved, but those really will just come with time on the water.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s track team was on fire this weekend as it competed in the Snowflake Classic at Tufts University, winning two events by more than eight seconds.
Despite competing with a limited squad, the men’s and women’s track and field programs combined for two first-place and two second-place finishes at Dussault Outdoor Track on Saturday.
Most of the athletes on both teams did not compete this weekend, but Harvard sent a small group of middle and long distance runners to Medford, Mass. this weekend to compete against a field comprised of local teams from all divisions.
Although the men finished just 17th out of the 27 schools in attendance while the women finished 10th out of 24, the team score was largely insignificant for the Crimson, considering the team was focusing on individual performances.
“This [meet] was just for a handful of student-athletes,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It fit in with their training to use this as a competitive opportunity.”
Only eight men and five women raced, with the men entering four runners in the 800-meter run and four in the 1500 meter, while the women entered one each in the 800 meter and 10000 meter and three in the 5000 meter.
The lack of a large team presence for Harvard did not keep those who raced from performing well, however. Sophomore Kieran Gallagher won the women’s 800-meter race in dominant fashion, finishing in 2:13.32, more than eight seconds ahead of the runner-up.
“[Not having the whole team], for me, doesn’t really change anything.” Gallagher said. “There’s so much support from the team, even if they’re not physically present there.”
Junior Whitney Thornburg took first in the women’s 10000-meter run by almost 11 seconds, with a time of 37:10.91.
All three Harvard runners who entered the women’s 5000-meter race were among the first 12 to finish, with sophomore Emma Payne, freshman Rachel Hampton and her classmate Gianna Cacciatore finishing second, seventh, and twelfth, respectively.
On the men’s side, all four entrants for the Crimson in the 800-meter race placed among the top 11 finishers, with Ryan Romain leading the way for his teammates with a time of 1:56.66, good for second overall.
In the 1500-meter run, sophomore Konrad Surkont narrowly edged out teammate Jack Stevenson, beating the freshman by a mere 14-hundredths of a second to claim sixth place. Twin brothers Carl and Fred Ward, both juniors, also ran the 1500m, finishing 13th and 24th, respectively.
“The student-athletes that we had compete did a really great job, and I was really pleased with what we were able to get out of the weekend,” Saretsky said.

After finishing off its spring break trip to California with two straight losses, the Harvard women’s tennis team got back on track Sunday afternoon. The Crimson took down No. 24 Houston (15-4) in a nailbiter of a match, notching a 4-3 victory. It was the team’s fourth win over a ranked team this season.
“Coming in, we knew they were a higher ranked opponent, so we just thought, we don’t really have anything to lose,” freshman Spencer Liang said. “We didn’t want to feel like we did back in California after having a couple bad losses, so we stepped up our game to close out the non-conference season and to have some momentum going into Ivy season.”
 
In a match that was close from the beginning, it was a dramatic doubles point victory that gave the Crimson the edge over Houston. After sophomores Amanda Lin and Amy He won, 8-4, at third doubles to put Harvard in the lead, it fell to the freshmen tandem of Liang and June Lee at second doubles to put the point away for the Crimson.
 
“We started off pretty aggressive, but they were also playing really well and crossing a lot, so it was pretty tight the whole match,” Lee said. “We just figured out some strategic things. For example, one of the girls had a weird lefty serve, so we both decided to play back and then just work our way into the net together. Us moving in together worked really well.”
 
Liang and Lee went back and forth with the Cougars’ Maria Cardenas and Tina Rupert on court two, eventually battling to a 7-7 tie. It was Harvard, however, that came up with the win in the tiebreak, as the two outlasted Cardenas and Rupert to win 5-0 and take the match, 8-7, to give Harvard the early advantage.
 
“We switched up the teams for this match, so this was a very good starting match for us,” Liang said. “Our opponents were very good, but June and I are very close and we just helped pump each other up, and even though it was very close we kept it together and kept our cool. I was really proud of us for pulling it out.”
 
The Crimson struggled following its early doubles win, as Houston stuck to its strength and rallied in the singles matches. The Cougars’ Despoina Vogasari took an easy 6-2, 6-0 victory from Liang at the first spot to tie the match up, 1-1, and her teammate Elena Kordolaimi followed up with a victory of her own at second singles. The junior’s 6-2, 7-6 win over Harvard freshman Monica Lin was Lin’s first loss in dual action at the second position this season.
 
Houston made it a clean sweep of the top three positions, as Rupert took down Lee in their second meeting at third singles. Rupert came out on top of a tight contest, as she clawed out a 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 victory.
 
“[Rupert] was really good, she had a lot of different weapons and the first set, I didn’t really figure out what her weaknesses were,” Lee said. “In the second and third sets, I tried to work my way through, and since she was a lefty I was just hitting more to her backhand, and pushing her back with high balls and moving in on the short balls. I fought pretty hard, and even though I lost it was still a good match.”
 
After Monica Lin’s loss at second singles gave Houston a 2-1 lead overall, the Crimson battled back with wins in matches lower on the singles ladder. He easily dispatched her opponent at fourth singles, and her doubles partner Amanda Lin followed up with a win of her own at sixth singles to put Harvard up, 3-2, with two matches remaining. Senior captain Hannah Morrill then clinched the match for the Crimson in the fifth spot, coming back after a first set loss to win the match two sets to one.
 
With the win over Houston giving the Crimson another victory heading into their Ivy League matches, the team is confident in its ability to be an important player in the conference this season.
“We want to do the same thing that we’re doing now [in our coming matches],” Lee said. “We want to stay focused and have that same belief with every school we play, that it doesn’t matter what ranking they are. Numbers don’t really mean anything, and we just want to have the same high intensity for every match coming up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard coed sailing team was back on the water this weekend, competing in four regattas in the northeast area and posting its highest finish in the one in which it hosted, the Central Series Three.
THE CENTRAL SERIES THREE
Hosting its first regatta of the spring season, Harvard placed fifth against 10 other schools within its conference. Junior Rebecca Frankel and freshman Bennett Capozzi finished in first for the A division with 27 points while freshmen David Mende and Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj took fifth in the B division.
“What really worked well for us was good communication between the two of us,” Capozzi said. “Keeping our heads in the game with the wind-shifts and what was going on in the course allowed us to sail the best we could as a team.”
The conditions on the Charles River were cold and windy, but the team was happy to be back on the water. Two regattas earlier in the season that were to be hosted by the Crimson had been canceled due to ice.
With the first-place divisional finish, Harvard finished with the highest overall ranking the team would make all weekend.
“[Frankel and I] want to work on being more physically involved,” Capozzi said. “We were a really light boat out there, we worked hard to keep it flat. Although we were mentally all there, physically, we could do more.”
BU TROPHY
Harvard was back on the Charles with another in-conference regatta this weekend, sailing in 420s for the BU trophy. The squad finished up on Sunday in seventh place with 152 points. Northeastern took the win with 106.
“This weekend was pretty good,” freshman Juan Perdomo said. “For me, I thought it was a good experience getting used to double handled boats since I was mostly in lasers last semester.”
Perdomo was joined in his 420 by classmate Priscilla Russo. The pair forced a head-to-head tiebreaker with Tufts, but lost that to fall to 10th with 86 points. The Crimson sent only freshmen to this regatta, with Matthew Mollerus and Olivia Kjorlien competing in the B division and coming in sixth place with 66 points.
“I think that the team as a whole is improving greatly,” Perdomo said. “We’re getting better and better, but we need to stay consistent with or results. We have to make sure the team is competing at the same level every weekend, which largely has to do with how we preform mentally.”
DELLENBAUGH WOMEN’S TROPHY
Four women of Harvard sailing went down to Brown for this intersectional regatta and returned in eighth place with 233 points.
The conditions were poor, with hard rain and cold in Providence, R.I. Eighteen schools competed in 420s.
In the A division, senior Caitlin Watson and sophomore Kristina Jakobson finished in 14th place with 135 points. Junior Ashleigh Inglis and sophomore Sophie Bermudez provided the better finish in fifth place, with 98 points.
MIT took first across the board, finishing up with a total of 134 points and Yale was right behind with 151, after taking third in both A and B divisions.
33RD LYNNE MARCHIANDO REGATTA
The Crimson was back on familiar waters for the third regatta on the Charles this weekend, this one being hosted by MIT. After a later start on Saturday due to a rowing regatta, 16 teams were matched up to begin the two-day round-robin style of competing. The boats being used were mixed, mostly FJs but then Fireflies for tiebreakers.
“The first day we sailed every team 15 times,” junior Michael Drumm said. “With this, there is a high emphasis on staying in control of opponents to help your own team do better. Covering, or getting in front and in control of the other boats on the water, was a strength for us this weekend.”
His twin Brian, classmate Gram Slattery, senior Isabel Ruane, sophomore Jacob Bradt, and freshman Julia Lord accompanied Drumm in this regatta. Harvard finished in ninth place.
“I think our communication has improved a lot, but it’s something to keep working on” Michael Drumm said. “In these races, there are three boats. We need to work together, so communication is a big part of that.”
Heading into next week, the Crimson faces its first qualifying regatta for the spring nationals. There will be many teams competing, but Drumm is confident. Harvard has competed against and beaten each of the teams at least once this year.
“As a whole, the main thing the team is working on is making sure that we compete at the same level every weekend, and that we have the mentality to make sure we do it,” Capozzi said.

Don’t get too excited, but if Mark J. Mauriello ’15, creator and director of “Julie Cooper: Genesis Prayer,”  has his way, Miley Cyrus will make be making an appearance on Harvard’s campus sometime this week.
Mauriello’s production, “Julie Cooper: Genesis Prayer,” tackles the modern dilemmas of celebrity pop culture.
“We’re not really sure where the distinctions are between person and persona..they become icons, almost in a religious sense, like Beyoncé is God,” Mauriello said.
Enter Miley #twerkprince$$. The inspiration to start a MILEY at HARVARD campaign complete with a Twitter account, came from the fact that Mauriello’s production deals with the leap from fiction to fantasy, and “people who were characters, who were caricatures,” he said. There was also “amazing inspiration from the bring Raven Symone to Harvard campaign.”
“[Miley is a] brilliant artist in the fact that she has crafted for herself this persona...this iconship,” Mauriello said. “Look at all the Mileys we had for Halloween this year...we’re all paying attention, we’re all watching her every move.”
Miley will be in Boston for her concert on April 2nd as part of the Bangerz tour. By the way, get your tickets—my seats are in section 309. Over two weeks later, “Julie Cooper: Genesis Prayer” will run from April 17th-19th. Logical conclusion: Why not invite Miley to campus?!?!
“She’s either absolutely definitely not coming or absolutely definitely coming, I’m not sure which one yet,” Mauriello said. But hey, she’s in Boston already, and what better way to spend an afternoon than chilling out on Harvard’s campus at Dean Pfister’s book club?
However, Mauriello has no plans to share Miley. If he gets his wish, Miley will be treated to pad thai, perhaps a tour of campus, and then Netflix while hanging out on Mauriello’s futon. They will definitely have plenty to talk about.
“With the exception of very few details, I think she and I are exactly the same person,” Mauriello said. “She has more money and Twitter followers than me but I’m working on it.”
Lest you think this all in jest, Mauriello is making a serious point. We are all constantly crafting our own personas, in everything that we do. Just because we’ll never know what’s going on inside Miley’s head, that doesn’t change Mauriello’s opinion that her "Wrecking Ball" video is a gift from God.

Adams is as much one of the most beloved houses at Harvard as it is a symbol of impregnability within the Harvard housing lottery.
 
I remember the week before Housing Day, the banner across Plympton Street declared proudly, “if you were in Adams, you’d be home by now!”. To me, it served a sordid reminder of what I wouldn’t obtain—I’d never even met a real Adams resident, what chance did I have of becoming one?! As I walked to lunch in Quincy (which had decidedly fewer dining restrictions), my head hung low with the other hundreds of freshman. I had mentally written off the centrally-located House of gargoyles, gilded walls, and bottomless sexual liberation. The promise of Adams had long been a dream, but one I coveted secretively. My acquaintances accepted my lies, stale phrases such as “Pfoho would be great!” or “Mather: singles for life!”
 
I remember visiting Harvard for the first time and being shown around Adams, wondering what lucky fate decided which students got to live there. To me, Adams was the Harvard of Harvard. Adams will provide a luxurious alternative to my off-yard, union dorm experience. I cannot live another day having to coerce any and all intrepid explorers from Grays to venture past Lamont. Now, in my new home, I will not be able to keep them away from my less-than-humble abode.
 
Winning the lottery shall never encapsulate me. I will not be defined solely as “that boy from Hurlbut who got into Adams,” though I don't doubt my good fortune brings me some attention. I am still in shock at being “accepted” by Adams, but I could not have done it without the unbelievable support and kindness of my blockmates, linkmates and newly jealous friends. The comradeship I felt with my peers, who stood with me as I received my rose and cigar, shall never die.
 
Nothing is ever impossible. Shoot for the moon because even if you miss, you will land on the shuttle.
 
A newly selected Adamsian.
