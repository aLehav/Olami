After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I began, in my sophomore year of high school, to devise a repertoire of meticulous tricks in preparation for every one of my trips home. I fancied myself an illusionist, pouring soy sauce on a white plate, tracing the outlines of my imaginary meal with a chopstick—it was a private comedy, a thrilling act of forgery, and I was both excited and offended that no one ever discovered my acts of deception. Perhaps, I thought, they were too distracted by my mother, who ate with a ferocity unmatched even by feral animals. She possessed an intimate understanding of hunger, told stories of catching and skinning frogs to feed her brothers. It used to embarrass me, how she would swallow her food as if someone were trying to steal it. Now I was glad her habits would cover mine.
At school it was easy to stay unnoticed. I did as I pleased, lived in a room no one else entered, and recorded my progress in dry-erase marker on the surface of a full-length mirror. Occasionally, a dorm-mate would remark on my continued absence from the dining hall. For the most part I was left in peace.
In my mind it was purely logical, the natural consequence of knowing how to count. I grew to love it, in time, the beauty of the balanced equation, the quantity subtracted, the triglyceride transformed into carbon and water. But first the simplicity of it seduced me. How easily the body could be revised, how quickly the flesh surrendered to the whims of its inhabitant. A bloodless coup, quiet as a child drowning.
I observed it sometimes in other girls, small details, the litany of mental measurements audible only to fellow zealots. No, not you too, I’d think, a sharp pang of jealousy rising in my chest as though we hadn’t all learned it together, as though the root of this special power hadn’t been offered to every one of us. Recall the sixth grade outings to Moscone Playground; recall the way we repurposed the seesaw into a scale, clever girls, always inventing. In these moments perhaps our destinies were manifest.
And still I thought my sister would be immune.
When I think I see the signs, the first real signs, I tell no one. I wonder about the cause of the sick feeling inside of me: Am I protective of my sister or possessive of my disease?
“Audrey,” I ask her finally, “what are you doing?”
She is tightening the laces of her running shoes. The window is open. It is mid-January. There are no seasons here. “I’ll be back before dark,” she says.
When she’s gone, I find the script on the dining room table. The writing is ugly. The dialogue is the kind that must be delivered with a strained third-world accent.
TING:
Mother! Mother! Why doesn’t she see me? Where does she go?
BO-TAO:
Is only us two now.
I wonder what the process is for a film like this. The famine begins in the second act. Will they shoot the scenes in sequence, my sister’s body shrinking alongside her character’s? Or will she be healthy one day and half-starved the next? I wonder what the director will tell her. Sorry, no craft services, you have to look near-death tomorrow.
TING:
Please, Uncle. One egg. I won’t ask you tomorrow.
BO-TAO:
Some rice? Uncle, I beg you, my sister is hungry.
She returns in an hour, sweaty and red. I offer her bread, string cheese, a granola bar. And in her face I see that awful turning, the fluctuating resolve. I almost hear the calculations, before finally she shakes her head and walks away—a fast learner, like me.
—Staff writer Angela F. Hui's column, "My Sister Will Be Hungry," is a serialized work of fiction centered around a college student's relationships with her mother and sister. The story explores the effects of collective cultural trauma on the second generation of an American family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I thought about Ernest Hemingway. I thought about the passage in “The Sun Also Rises” when Lady Ashley says, “We could have had such a damned good time together.” And the protagonist—looking away from her and at the policeman directing traffic—replies, “Isn’t it pretty to think so?” I thought it summed up everything I wanted for my films. I’d like to make films about the act of looking away.
Hemingway was resolutely alone. A reporter faithful to his profession, he went in and out of wars and revolutions in order to observe, not to participate. Maybe he believed that there was no point in attempting to change the nature of things. Maybe he preferred to imagine rather than to take action. And when reality became suffocating, he looked away, a gesture that, if impactless, is at least tender.
Or maybe it was cowardly. Maybe it is shameful to deny your own agency and to abandon the pursuit of your ideals and your happiness.
On the beach, someone was playing Boléro. “Why search for perfection when it’s right here?” he said to the two people next to him. “Listen to the mathematical precision in the way the theme repeats and evolves.” He noticed me and spoke in my direction, “If you look up Boléro on YouTube, the first result is a recording by London Symphony Orchestra with Valery Gergiev. A hell of a conductor! A classy man with an ivory cream bow tie. And the performance is just fantastic!” He pretended to tie a bow tie, and started waving the skewer in his hand along to Boléro.
Then I thought about a story I’d heard from a friend. After breaking up with a long-term girlfriend, he had taken a spontaneous trip to Beijing. Hoping for hookups, he had ended up roaming back and forth on the same street late one night. He would see people approaching, hoping discreetly that something would happen, but then always pass them by without making eye contact. He would follow sounds to a bar or a barbeque restaurant, and realize nothing was actually happening. Finally he matched with a girl on a dating app, who asked him to join her at an internet cafe. There, he sat next to her and watched her play video games for four hours straight. When it was morning, she asked if he wanted to have breakfast together. They had stir fried noodles, then each went back to their own place.
Kwan Yin asked me if I wanted to join her and her friends for karaoke. I could not have come up with anything more depressing. When I left after telling her to have a good time, I noticed that the Boléro man was still talking about Boléro. He waved at me as I walked away.
I couldn’t sleep all night. I went outside for Korean food and felt my stomach cursing my brain as the kimchi mixed with the barbecue from earlier in the evening. Then I lay in my bed for an hour, debating whether I should masturbate, and decided I didn’t particularly feel like it. “Ain’t it all a drag?” I thought to myself, “But good job at least trying to be social today.” I sat up and wrote down all the ideas I’d had today for the script.
I looked out the window as the sky brightened. I remembered stumbling upon thick rolls of paper at a bookstore in New York labeled “one dollar each—write on a roll like Jack Kerouac!” But I hadn’t had anything to write. Maybe the Boléro man could use those rolls, but I just wanted to think about nothing. Deep inside, I knew there was value in thinking about nothing. I believed in thinking about nothing.

“Is there a guy with, like, a basket on his head?”
A story “hangs a lampshade” when it veers into the implausible/cliché/surreal and, rather than explain itself, cheekily acknowledges this veering and moves on. At its best, lampshading preserves the audience’s trust by assuring them that their confusion is valid and, in the process, allows them a moment of camaraderie with the storyteller. At its worst, lampshading is lazy writing, replacing reason with unctuous self-awareness.
When “Legion” gives us women with mustaches, singing, then has a character say, “Wait, were there women with mustaches, singing?” it’s lampshading at its worst.
The bizarre has always been in “Legion”’s wheelhouse. After all, the first season featured Jemaine Clement as a jazz-loving telepath in an antique diving suit, living in an ice cube on the astral plane. Yet this willful strangeness used to have its own internal logic. In its first eight episodes, “Legion” planted the viewer firmly in the erratic mind of David Haller (Dan Stevens)—either a schizophrenic, the most powerful mutant in the world, or both. With David mediating what the audience sees of the show’s world, anything was fair game. The result was a thrilling, innovative season of television: Rom-com lovey-doveyness, paralyzing scares, superhero pyrotechnics, and Kubrick-worship all found their place in a narrative structure that ambitiously and successfully matched David’s experience of reality. The absurdity, the horror, and all the other glitches were extensions of David’s traumas (the knife-wielding children’s book character The World’s Angriest Boy in the World), his elisions (the botched robbery of his psychologist), or external tampering with his perceptions (the parasitic Devil with the Yellow Eyes). As disorienting as “Legion” got, it used to be grounded in its protagonist.
The second season pivots, as showrunner Noah Hawley explained to Salon: “If the first year was about an individual who either is or isn't insane, what if the second year is more about a sane man in an insane world?” This shift is a mistake. “Chapter 9” keeps all the quirks of the previous season without the core that made it compelling. David—who has apparently spent the past year trapped in an orb—moves from generator of madness to the straight man, struggling to keep up with a world drastically different from the one he left. His girlfriend, Syd (Rachel Keller), no longer trusts him. She can also switch bodies with cats now. Summerland, the mutant safe haven that protected and trained him, has been assimilated into Division 3, the government organization that spent all of last season hunting him. He now works for Admiral Fukuyama (Marc Oka), a man with a basket on his head who speaks through three android women with mustaches. “Chapter 9” relocates the madness from David to the outside world, sapping it of meaning and weight. “Legion” remains weird, but when the driving question of the series is no longer David’s sanity, who cares?
It may be unfair to criticize the way “Legion” handles its themes before the rest of the season comes out, like nitpicking the setup before hearing the punchline. Yet this empty flashiness extends to the most fundamental aspects of the show. The writing, when examined on a line-by-line basis, seems to have deteriorated. For instance, David and Syd’s reunion is, in concept, rich with conflicting emotions. Syd remains in love with David, yet she resents him for his absence. Meanwhile, she has grown into a different person in the intervening year. Can she relearn how to be comfortable in his presence again? David, on the other hand, thinks he’s only been gone a day. How will he react to the news that he’s lost a year of his life, let alone to the fact that he unintentionally abandoned his girlfriend? As a thought experiment/writing exercise, think about how you, the viewer, would proceed. Would you cap the scene with the two estranged lovers having triumphant astral plane sex, set to “We Love You” by the Rolling Stones, like the writers did?
Baffling writing like this abounds throughout “Chapter 9.” When David meets Admiral Fukuyama, the three mustachioed women offer his backstory, unprompted: “When we were a boy, we had the machine put in our head. For days we screamed. The pain was in the volcano, puncturing the molten core. The device very deep in our cerebral cortex, like nails from a bomb inside a public place. Hardware inside software. And now we are this. The machine that bleeds. The organizing principle.” These lines strive for mystery and poetry, but fall short of both. What does “The pain was in the volcano, puncturing the molten core” mean? Not only is it a non sequitur, it is unevocative. Do volcanoes feel pain? Are we meant to relate to the volcano?
A symptom of this sloppy writing is the foregrounding of “Legion”’s influences. Once an important but minor part of the show’s charm, these visual nods have never been more obtrusive. Words in Futura are slapped onto frame after frame in the hope that anyone who has seen a Wes Anderson movie will mistake the feeling of recognition for an aesthetic experience. There are touches taken directly from “Twin Peaks”: The egg that hatches a malformed, spider-legged creature, for instance, or the one-armed messenger on a different plane of existence. And when the messy haired, T-shirt-clad protagonist has a dance crew battle amid lens flares, there’s more than a little “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World”—minus the color and taste in music. What is the aim of this intertextuality? If it’s to distract the audience from what’s happening onscreen by reminding them of other, more groundbreaking pieces of art, then mission accomplished.
It is, of course, premature to dismiss the second season of “Legion” on the basis of its premiere. It has nine more episodes to course correct, and a recovery is likely: As showrunner for both “Legion” and “Fargo,” Hawley has four near-flawless seasons of television under his belt, and the cast, characters, and world of the show remain compelling. Yet “Chapter 9” is an unfortunate misstep, maintaining the idiosyncrasies of the first season without the thematic grounding and inventive writing. It’s all style, no substance. Sure, Jon Hamm shows up to narrate educational segments about Zhuang Zhou and some guy named Albert A. who saws off his leg. Sure, there’s a motif of a maze, with an actual minotaur in the show’s margins—a dude with a donkey’s head and a wooden cart for legs, pulling himself forward via forearm crutches. But what’s the point?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As its title would indicate, Episode Five takes place in a barbershop—at least, at first. All Alfred (Brian Tyree Henry) wants is a haircut for his upcoming photoshoot, but his barber, Bibby has other plans. He cuts one strip of Alfred’s hair before launching into award-worthy dodges that thwart every one of Alfred’s threats to “fuck [him] up” if he doesn’t finish the job. Bibby (Robert S. Powell III) shines in this brief, behind-the-scenes look at how Alfred maintains his look, but the Alfred-focused episode is ultimately a failed exercise in the art of meandering.
The episode is full of showrunner Donald Glover’s directorial quirks, but unlike last season’s masterpiece “B.A.N.” (for which Donald Glover won an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series), “Barbershop” is a dud. Maybe because Glover did not also write the episode, the comedy feels too drawn out, the episode does nothing to advance the plot, and there is barely any of the social commentary we have grown used to in “Atlanta.” We might appreciate Bibby pointing out that there were zero “movie posters [the theater] got on there with black people on them… Key and Peele movie out with a cat in it, they put the cat on the poster,” but the observation is somewhat off for a show that hinges on timeliness, considering the movie referenced, “Keanu,” was released in 2016, and in light of “Black Panther”’s success and Peele’s triumph with his Oscar-winning “Get Out.”  We might reminisce at the Youtube video Bibby insists on showing Al featuring “that basketball player that hit all them people at the club in that invisible car,” but the inside joke from Season One no longer feels relevant—at least not here. We might laugh at the absurd thought of Alfred as a magician—which Bibby’s son takes him as, mistaking his hair-cutting cape for a magician’s cape—but at that point, we, like Alfred, are already too annoyed with Bibby and the course of the episode to be properly amused.
Even Powell’s performance as Bibby cannot save the episode, though he puts in a noble effort. He drags Alfred to his girlfriend’s home, where he proceeds to cut his son’s hair—and not Alfred’s—before stealing money as payment for the haircut. He tries to make it up to Alfred by feeding him his favorite, “Zaxby’s,” only to give the rapper his cold leftovers. And through it all, Powell talks Bibby (who lives in his own world) out of every frustrating situation in a mumbling, fast-paced, nearly incomprehensible speech and body language that speaks to the actor’s comedic skills. His self-satisfied sneer, barely visible behind his car window as he steals lumber from a woman’s property while she calls the police, is unwarranted for everyone else but him. “Sue!” he provokes her. “But you need to talk to your husband, 'cause we ain't had no contracts, 'cause he cheap.” His hypocritical indignation at his son’s irresponsibility feels genuine, to the point where we nearly start nodding along with him: “You think I work hard at these three jobs so you can walk around town... skipping school all day? I work hard, man,” he laments. Bibby is so sincere, we almost forgive his senselessness.
At its halfway point, “Atlanta: Robbin’ Season” is going nowhere (like Alfred’s hair). In what could and should have been a brilliant episode under Donald Glover’s direction in a barbershop setting ripe for hilarity, “Barbershop” disappoints more than Bibby does Alfred.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson reported that the College will increase the student activities fee—an optional sum paid by Harvard undergraduates as part of their enrollment costs—from $75 to $200 next academic year. The Office of Student Life will also form a committee of students and administrators to allocate the funds, which used to go directly to the Undergraduate Council’s budget.
These are welcome changes. Though campus social life has transformed in the past decade, and inflation has eaten away at the fee revenue’s purchasing power, this activities fee has held constant since 2006.
Furthermore, since 2015, University President Drew G. Faust has helped fund undergraduate social events by providing part of her discretionary fund to the College, which uses it to fund student social life. However, the certainty of this continued funding source is unclear given the presidential turnover.
Meanwhile, the Undergraduate Council—which is currently responsible for allocating the student activities fee funding—is struggling with a budget shortfall, and it drew down a third of its emergency fund earlier this semester to continue funding student organizations. Having faced these problems in the past, the UC called for a raise in the fee in 2012, to no avail.
We therefore believe that the current system of relying on Faust’s discretionary funding and still not having sufficient funds for normal UC operations is unsustainable. This raise will also bring the College’s fee closer to many of its peers. At Brown, Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, and Columbia, for example, the activities fee averages $205 per year.
Furthermore, given recent financial mismanagement of the UC, we support transitioning control over student activities fee inflows away from the Council and toward a committee of students and administrators. Such a change will also allow for improvements in the distribution of funds between the UC, College Events Board, House Committees, and Intramural Council.
We do however remain concerned about the continuing voluntary nature of the student activities fee. The fee is not part of tuition, and students can avoid paying it by mailing a letter to the College at the start of the academic year. This is an unfortunate reality—it permits students to enjoy the products of the fee, such as events paid for by the CEB, like Yardfest, or organizations supported by the UC, without paying. This creates the potential of a problem akin to a tragedy of the commons, as any student not paying the fee can enjoy the benefits of those who do. Instead, the College should make the fee mandatory, yet, of course, provide appropriate financial aid for those students who require it.
It is also concerning that the College did not announce this fee change to students directly, and there is a level of disingenuousness in the College’s allowing students to opt out of the fee only by physical mail, while not making this possibility well-known. Nevertheless, if properly announced and formalized, a mandatory fee would avoid these concerns.
Student life at the College has remained an important and changing area of scrutiny. For the many students who attend and rely on events sponsored by College-support organizations, including student groups and the CEB, this increase in the student activities fee will ensure the continuity of their social life. As the College continues to change, supporting strong student social life is essential.

Despite the current political climate, Harvard, in contrast to its peer institutions, saw an increase in international student applicants for 2018-19. Many international students, just like many American students, dream of coming to Harvard to pursue excellence in research. And, just like many American students, we face the ups-and-downs of being graduate students.
Unlike our American peers, however, we often work far away from our families and friends with uncertainty around when and how frequently we might be able to go back home. Importantly, our visas—and many of our rights—are tied to our status as students at this institution. As a result, the usual challenges of graduate school—the precariousness of our compensation and healthcare benefits or maintaining healthy and productive relationships with our advisors—are magnified manyfold for us. This severely restricts our ability to advocate for ourselves when faced with difficult situations at work, such as harassment or unreasonable expectations from our supervisors. Many of us choose silence over risking our academic careers, especially because for some of us, based on our country of origin, losing visa status may mean never getting a second chance.
In fact, we personally know cases of international graduate students not speaking up with accounts of sexual harassment in their labs, about being denied time off to visit family, or about being ridiculed by our advisors while being passed on for professional development opportunities like conference funding.
Faced with these challenges, we feel vulnerable and often without substantive support from the administration. Our mental health care staff routinely lack sensitivity to pressures unique to being an international student, and the high cost of accessing external care, especially given visa restrictions on where and how much we can work, means our concerns often remain unaddressed. There are also few systems of support to help us manage relationships with advisors and supervisors. Troublingly, we do not know what recourse there might be if we were unjustly forced out of an academic program, even though being forced out often means being forced to leave the country because our visas are tied to active status in academic programs.
This lack of systematic support from the administration mirrors what we see at the undergraduate level with students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Moreover, despite the pro-immigration stance the administration has taken rhetorically, the actual responses from the administration to the increasingly restrictive immigration policies on the federal level have been feeble, to say the least. We cannot help but often feel that this university is not a place made for us. While in recent years the University has stepped up its efforts to recruit students globally, it has not coupled these efforts with adequate resources for those it recruits.
How could international students address these issues? How could we push the University administration to do more for international students? Such advocacy requires that we band together to speak up boldly and organize actively; while we may be a few in number in our own departments, we make up nearly one-third of the graduate student population at Harvard.
One way to get our voices heard and turn organizing into real leverage is via mobilizing for a union. The right to join and participate in labor unions in the U.S. is legally protected for international student workers in the same manner as it is for domestic workers. Full participation in our union would empower us to shape student workers’ priorities as a whole and bargain with the University administration on an equal footing to improve our conditions. Full access to our union’s grievance procedure would ensure that we have the ability to fight back whenever faced with unjust treatment.
Across the country, graduate workers’ unions have won powerful protections for international students. For example, in 2015, graduate employees at the Wayne State University secured a clause in their union contract that an absence due to immigration procedures shall be treated the same way as an absence caused by illness or injury. At the University of Connecticut, graduate students won provisions in their union contract that prevent the university from imposing visa-related fees on international students. On our own campus, the Harvard International Office established an emergency hotline for international students and scholars who encounter difficulties entering the border in April 2017, after the International Scholars Working Group of the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Automobile Workers advocated for such a measure for over two months through a petition supported by hundreds of Harvard community members.
Mobilizing for our union would not be a panacea for all of the challenges we face, including the rise in xenophobic policies federally. But it does provide one concrete way for us to hold the University accountable and make specific demands. Our power in this process originates from the fact that student workers across the entire campus come together, join forces, and have each other’s back. International student workers, who now make up a substantial portion of the membership of various local unions affiliated with the UAW, have also significantly shaped the priorities and advocacy efforts of the UAW on the level of national politics. In recent years, the UAW has actively advocated to lift limits on employment-based green cards for foreign students graduating from American universities with advanced degrees and to expand the OPT program.
Ultimately, our Harvard is better when all members, including our international students, work with the stability of a contract and the security of a community that can organize in times of need. We are voting for this better Harvard by voting "yes" on April 18 and 19, and encourage our fellow international student voters to join us so that present and future scholars have equal access to opportunities regardless of where they were born and what their passports say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hypothetically, I’m not terrible with numbers. I’ve taken multivariable calculus (albeit specifically for social sciences concentrators), econometrics, and have turned in dozens of Stata problem sets over the last year or so. I’m no math concentrator, but I do have reasonable competency with numerical operations.
Yet, when I am handed a map, compass, and protractor and am expected to plot and then actually go find five grid coordinates in the woods during an Army land navigation training? My brain starts flashing the blue screen of death that my old Windows XP desktop machine would flash on the daily. (Fun aside: The Department of Defense seems to still largely rely on ancient Windows operating systems. You should definitely be concerned.)
You would think that, being a college student, basic geometry like plotting grid coordinates and measuring angles would be a piece of cake. However, the woods do not care at all about how smart or clever you might be or where you go to college. You can perfectly plot your points, plan an ingenious route, shoot perfect compass azimuths, but the woods and terrain will still have the final say.
Does the Army have digital GPS systems that lead us exactly to where we need to go most of the time? Yes. Will I actually pull out my compass, protractor, and map to navigate my platoon to an objective when I’m a Lieutenant? I shouldn’t eliminate the possibility, but it’s fairly unlikely. But as is the case with many events in Army ROTC, the ultimate goal of seemingly irrelevant training is not necessarily developing perfect compass skills, but developing the mental skills to stay calm and collected under pressure.
Can I keep my wits about me and not panic when the point marker isn’t exactly where I expected it? Can I exercise tactical patience and pace out 50 meters in each cardinal direction to systematically canvas the area where I think the point should be? Will I decide that the woods will not defeat me? These are the questions that land navigation training is actually asking—not just whether I can read an eight-digit grid coordinate.
When Army ROTC battalions take cadets out into the woods, equip them with real M16 rifles loaded with blanks, issue them MREs (meals ready-to-eat, which are surprisingly not terrible), and task them into infantry platoons during spring field training (as our battalion did this weekend during a casual April snowstorm), the goal isn’t necessarily to develop supremely competent, super hooah infantrymen. The goal is to develop resilient leaders and effective communicators. Every cadet will need those soft skills, whether they’re leading a real Infantry platoon or commanding a Cyber task force.
Yes, there are basic soldier skills that every officer, non-commissioned officer, and junior enlisted have to have. The Army has to be able to speak a common language when we talk for example about operations orders, task organization, and standards. In ROTC-land, this is certainly important, but developing the ability and mental toughness to lead your peers and subordinates through a cold, wet, hungry hell is what will make or break cadets.
You can read the Ranger Handbook cover to cover, but there isn’t a page on how to motivate these cold, wet, tired, and hungry cadets to get up and move out quickly. You can bring the most high-speed terrain model kits and cover every single line of an operations order, yet still fail to create a shared understanding of what job each squad in your platoon has during a patrol mission. You can be the most knowledgeable and the most tactically and doctrinally sound platoon leader out there, yet still fail to take care of your soldiers.
Being a leader in the field is as much about managing people and personalities as it is understanding doctrine and tactics. Sometimes, it takes a miserable April snowstorm to teach you how to endure, how to take care of your soldiers while holding them to the standards of their profession, and how to hold yourself to those same supposed standards.
I’m reminded of one Colonel Kenneth Mintz, former commander of Army Cadet Command’s Second Brigade (in charge of overseeing the New England Army ROTC battalions), and how he once led our Paul Revere Battalion through a combat PT workout that was nothing but low-crawling back and forth across a field with a dummy M16 rifle for an almost an hour. At the end of this session, Colonel Mintz stood in tattered fatigues (he had done this workout several times in one week with almost every Massachusetts unit) and told us simply that we become a team when we do hard things together.
What a valuable reminder for any weekend of brutal training conditions—we’re never out there in the frosted forests struggling on our own. Doing the hard things together makes us better.

Renovations to Robinson Hall will begin this June in order to make the building more accessible.
The changes will include the installation of an elevator that accesses each floor of the building as well as the addition of new restrooms and renovation of existing ones, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. After the renovations, the building will be compliant with codes outlined in the Americans with Disabilities Act.
In addition to making the building more accessible, the renovations will update student and faculty workspaces in Robinson.
“The project will also modernize departmental administration offices, create needed new faculty offices, and improve existing classroom space,” Dane wrote in an email.
These major renovations will also include the installation of an automatic sprinkler system per a statewide resolution passed in 2008 that requires buildings over 7,500 square feet to have an “adequate system of automatic sprinklers in accordance with the provisions of the state building code.” This requirement does not apply retroactively to buildings existing before the law was put in place, but can be triggered in the case of major alterations.
The project, expected to be completed by the end of 2018, will have a significant impact on the building’s inhabitants. History Department chair, Daniel L. Smail, whose office is one of many in Robinson, said the renovations will be difficult but “manageable” for staff and faculty.
“Almost the entirety of the faculty will have to leave and arrangements are being made for the staff to have various forms of temporary office space in corners of the building while the work is going on,” Smail said.
Robinson Hall was constructed in 1904 and originally housed the Department of Architecture. It is currently home to the History department, which includes over 50 faculty members, 200 undergraduate concentrators, and 130 graduate students.

Several animal heads discovered in a trash can on Church St. on March 31 appear to have been used in a religious ritual and are not being investigated as a crime, according to the Cambridge Police Department.
According to the official Cambridge police report, three boxes containing three pig heads, deer heads, and a bird, were found near the trash barrels on the street. The officer on duty at the time notified both animal control and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The remains were later removed by the Department of Public Waste.
“The pig heads also had what appeared to be incense sticks driven into them with leftover ash on their faces,” officer Joseph Crowley wrote in the official police report.
Crowley wrote that the remains likely played a role in some sort of religious ritual.
“In Thailand, Buddhists place pig heads on tables with incense sticks in them as food offering shrines,” Crowley wrote.
“The incident does not appear to be a crime and the practice of rituals such as the one described above as part of religion is protected by the first amendment,” the report further read.
Janet Gyatso, a professor of Buddhist studies at the Divinity School, said she did not know what the animal remains might have been used for.
“As an animal ethicist I am dismayed at the horrible and cruel use of animals in this way,” Gyatso said. “I have heard that there may indeed be such rituals in Thailand, although I don’t know anything about it.”

UPDATED: April 10 at 9:19 p.m.
Harvard College launched a fund Monday to support a new group of student teaching fellows in the Computer Science department in memory of Alexander H. Patel ’17-’18.
As a part of the Alex Patel Peer Teaching Fellows Fund, the Computer Science department plans to form a team of students who will serve as supplementary teaching fellows for various department courses and will provide individual tutoring to students, Alex’s father Hiren Patel wrote in a letter to family and friends Tuesday.
“We were looking for something that would be very one-on-one and would be specific to the CS department and would also help foster that kind of personal relationship that Alex really felt was important,” Hiren said in an interview Tuesday.
Patel—a Harvard undergraduate who died last semester at the age of 22—was remembered by peers and faculty as not only a brilliant student but also an “incredible friend.” On top of his academic coursework, Patel served as a teaching fellow for several Computer Science classes throughout his time at the College.

He also wrote for The Crimson, reporting on Harvard Business School and working for the paper’s data analysis team. A data-based 2015 article Patel helped produce on faculty political donations earned him a national award.
Patel, a Philosophy and Mathematics concentrator, died by suicide, according to the Massachusetts Medical Examiner’s Office.
Patel’s passion and dedication for his work as a teaching fellow served as the inspiration for the creation of the new fund, Hiren said.
“This started because we were trying to think of a way to honor Alex, and Alex loved teaching, particularly on a one-on-one basis,” Hiren said. “He wanted to actually help you, not just getting through your [problem set], but to get to know you better and to understand and to make a connection because he believed that was part of what the teaching process involved.”
Members of the Computer Science department, including Margo I. Seltzer ’83—who served as a research mentor for Patel—played a key role in creating the fund, Hiren said. Seltzer wrote she is “very grateful” to the other Computer Science professors who helped out.
In an interview Tuesday, Seltzer said the teaching fellowship comprises the “perfect” way to remember Patel.
“I am extraordinarily happy to see this fund be created,” she said. “I think it's a positive thing that the family has been able to do in the face of real devastation and tragedy and I think the fund will keep Alex's memory alive in Harvard Computer Science for a long time and that makes me really happy.”
Seltzer—who said Patel was “super passionate and dedicated to his students” as a teaching fellow—said students and faculty have been “incredibly supportive” of efforts to begin the fund.
“Every time I mention this to undergraduates or graduate students, they get that look in their eyes that says, ‘Oh, this is the perfect way to remember Alex,’” she said.
Patel teaching fellows will help provide “additional resources” to “students who are struggling the most,” according to Seltzer. She said the fellows will supplement—not replace—normal course staff.
Seltzer said the inaugural class of fellows should include people who knew Patel.
“What’s important to this program is that the first cohort of fellows be people who knew Alex,” she said. “Moving forward, our goal is that each year the cohort of Patel fellows will help us pick the next cohort so that we can keep the memory of Alex alive.”
Hiren said he thinks the preliminary response to the establishment of the fund has been “fantastic.”
“It’s a shame, I think, many of us don’t know how many lives we touch until we’re gone,” Hiren Patel said. “I think so many people whose lives have touched by Alex and who knew him well will be supportive.”
Contributions to the fund can be made online at https://community.alumni.harvard.edu/give/16040771 or mailed to Harvard University Alumni and Development Services, 124 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge, MA 02138.

UPDATED: April 11, 2018 at 1:45 a.m.
Young people in America said they are increasingly dissatisfied with the current Congress and will be “definitely voting” in the upcoming midterm elections, according to the spring 2018 edition of the Institute of Politics’ biannual youth poll released Tuesday.
The survey was organized by a team of undergraduates from the Harvard Public Opinion Project, an Institute of Politics program, and included more than 2000 survey results from 18- to 29-year olds nationwide, according to Theodore "Teddy" N. Landis ’20, the student chair of the project. Some of the survey's key findings include data about young Americans' opinions on President Trump, political parties, and various institutions including, for the first time, technology companies like Google and Facebook.
This is the first release of data from the project. Subsequent installments of the project’s results will be announced within the next three weeks, IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said.
John Della Volpe, the IOP polling director in charge of the survey, said one of the most significant findings of the survey was the heightened interest in midterm elections.
“This is the most interest we have seen in midterm voting in the history of our poll,” Della Volpe said.
More than 37 percent of young Americans said they “definitely will be voting” in the 2018 elections, a marked increase from the 23 percent of those surveyed in 2010, the most recent year of a “wave” election.
Democrats are leading that charge, according to the survey, with 51 percent of young party members reporting they “definitely will vote” in the elections as compared to the 36 percent of Republicans who say the same.
Approval of congressional Democrats and Republicans remained relatively stable from last fall, with backing of Democrats dropping from 42 to 41 percent and Republicans growing from 23 to 24 percent.
Landis said a lot of the momentum predicted in this poll will be translated into the 2018 midterm elections.
“What we’re seeing is that a lot of young people are really angry,” Landis said. “The seas are really choppy out there, and we are not just seeing blue waves. We’re seeing a lot of youth waves as well.”
“We think that is attributable to many young people’s distaste for Trump and his administration,” he added.
President Trump’s rating remained stable at 25 percent approval and 72 percent disapproval from last year’s fall semester poll.
Landis said student involvement in the poll is an important aspect of the process, as the undergraduates participating help to craft the questions sent out by GfK, a research institute which sends out the survey.
“It’s a collaboration between political professionals and undergraduate students,” Landis said. “We, as students, are uniquely able to ask the questions that are important to other people like us.”
Landis said the questions chosen by students “anticipated” many of the events now in the news, including privacy concerns on social media. The New York Times reported last month that Cambridge Analytica, a political data company hired by Trump during the 2016 presidential elections, obtained the private information of more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in front of Congress Tuesday to answer questions about this data privacy and security.
According to the survey, which was conducted before news of Cambridge Analytica broke, roughly  25 percent of young people said they “never” trust Uber, Twitter, or Facebook. Only about 15 percent of young Americans said they “never” trust Amazon or Google.
In a list of institutions polled, college and university administrators sit firmly at the top of the approval ratings, with 61 percent of young Americans saying they trust them “all” or “most of the time.”
According to Della Volpe, the next part of the poll, focused on young people’s attitudes toward the overall state of the country, democracy, and views related to populism, is scheduled to be released later this week.

Jane J. Mansbridge, a Harvard Kennedy School professor of political leadership and democratic values, is this year’s recipient of the 2018 Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science, the highest international honor for political scientists.
The committee that awards the prize chose to honor Mansbridge for her “field-defining contributions to our understanding of the theory and practice of democracy, political representation and deliberation as well as feminist theory,” according to a statement released by the Skytte Foundation Friday.
Past recipients of the prize include Harvard Government professors Theda Skocpol and Robert D. Putnam. The award ceremony is scheduled for Sept. 29.
Mansbridge said she was “thrilled” and “excited” to receive the award, adding the honor was significant, not just for herself, but also because it stresses the importance of political awareness.
“I took the award not only to be something about me but also something about the importance of the subjects I study, so I was very, very happy,” Mansbridge said.
Mansbridge is known for crafting political theories pertaining to groups historically underrepresented in politics. One theory, which she calls “descriptive representation,” enumerates the benefits of having representatives with the same experiences as their constituents, especially African Americans and women.
The press release announcing the award called Mansbridge “a pioneering role model for women in political science.” Mansbridge, who began working on women’s issues in 1968, was quick to say that title was an exaggeration, citing other female leaders in the field.
“One of the things you know if you spend anytime in the women's movement is that this stuff is collective. None of us could do it without the others,” Mansbridge said.
At the beginning of her career, as a woman studying political science, Mansbridge said she often had to find creative ways to attract attention in a classroom.
“You have to be willing to put your hand up really straight when you want to ask a question and sit in the front row so that they can't miss you,” Mansbridge said. “You have to know what you're saying.”
Mansbridge, the former president of the American Political Science Association, said she has faith that the field of political science can create solutions for modern problems like climate change.
“These problems are going to get more and more interdependent and the only group of people in the entire planet whose job it is to think about this stuff is political science,” Mansbridge said. “More and more people are going to be really trying to help.”

UPDATED: April 12, 2018 at 3:45 a.m.
Joining a few hundred demonstrators with signs reading “1 in 5. Is that my future?” and “No means no,” a handful of Harvard students braved the April cold on Tuesday to join the Student Rally Against Sexual Violence at the Massachusetts State House in Boston.
The rally—organized by the student-led Every Voice Coalition—was in support of two bills currently in Massachusetts House committees: H.4159 requires colleges and universities to administer sexual misconduct climate surveys and H.632 codifies Title IX protections for victims of sexual assault, enforcing equal access to education.
Citing Bureau of Labor Statistics that up to 90 percent of sexual assaults go unreported, proponents argue that the climate survey bill would provide accurate information to evaluate the prevalence of sexual assault in higher education.
“The first step to solving any problem is understanding it,” said Rep. Lori A. Ehrlich, the lead sponsor of H.4159. “And the way it is right now, we lack hard data and statistics that are needed to measure the depth and breadth of sexual harassment and violence at colleges and universities.”
Ehrlich said she worked closely with John B. Gabrieli '16 to develop the bill—and with Harvard Kennedy School students Catherine M. “Cici” Coquillette and Elyse N. Voegeli to garner support for it. Coquillette and Voegeli wrote a “fact sheet” advising legislators on best practices based on data collected from colleges and universities in Massachusetts that have already implemented such surveys.
While Harvard implemented a sexual assault climate survey in 2015, Voegeli said H.4159 would ensure that every school in Massachusetts has to participate in such a survey and would collect comparable data from different schools. The task force to create the climate survey would include state officials, college students, and representatives of rape crisis centers.
“You might be getting from one school a sexual violence rate of 0.1 percent, and you might be getting from another school 30 percent,” Voegeli said. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that more incidences are happening at those schools–it’s just that the question was asked differently, in such a way that people responded differently.”
Coquillette said the cost of developing a climate survey is often a barrier for implementation. She said the state would provide the new survey to Massachusetts colleges and universities free of charge.
“A lot of the bigger private schools are able to do these sorts of surveys and have the resources to do it, where more community colleges or smaller schools just don't have the resources,” she said.
H.632, and its sister bill in the Massachusetts Senate, S.706, would strengthen Obama-era sexual assault reporting and response requirements, mandating annual awareness and prevention training, the publication of policies and resources for sexual violence data online, and equal rights, notices, and representation for both the reporting and responding parties.
“When it comes to sexual assault, we want to ensure, to mandate, that there will be training for all students, staff, and faculty, around sexual assault—that everyone will be aware of their rights and what the procedures are,” said Rep. Tricia Farley-Bouvier, the lead sponsor of the bill. “There are rights for the victims, and for the responders. Everybody's rights need to be protected.”
“The person who inspired me to really look at this issue was my daughter, who started to look at colleges, and it got really scary,” she added. “You all chose your schools. You all could figure out, pretty easily, which schools have the best English professors, which schools have the best dining halls…Shouldn’t you know which schools are the safest?”
Eight Harvard student groups endorsed the rally, including the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better. Student groups from MIT, Mt. Holyoke College, Boston University, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Northeastern University also attended the event.
The Every Voice Coalition, co-founded by Gabrieli, was the primary organizer of the rally. The group is comprised of students, those who have experienced sexual assault, and experts who advocate a campus climate survey as the first step towards improved campus safety.
Gabrieli said he was particularly moved by witnessing survivors and advocates “reclaim the narrative.”
“I mean today was incredible because students actually got to sit face to face with legislators. We had 40 meetings today with legislators in addition to our rally itself. There were meetings where survivors were telling a legislator to their face, ‘This is my story. This is why this matters to me. This is why we have to act.’”
Representatives from both the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club said the bills are urgently needed on college campuses.
“Sexual assault and harassment has become an epidemic on higher education campuses, and not doing something is unacceptable at this point,” said Kiera E. O’Brien ’20, president of the Harvard Republican Club.
Isabel A. Giovannetti ’21, communications director of the Harvard College Democrats, said that by working together, the Democrats and Republicans are sending a message that the bills should be non-partisan.
“This issue is not a partisan issue in any way. And I think emphasizing that by showing that both the College Democrats and the College Republicans are in support of these bills is really powerful,” Giovannetti said. “There’s no left or right side to preventing sexual violence.”
In the fight against sexual violence on college campuses, Rep. Farley-Bouvier said students can play an important role.
“It cannot be overstated how important student voices are in this conversation. The more students that are speaking out, the better it is for the passage of this bill,” she said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 12, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Rep. Lori A. Ehrlich worked with Kennedy School students to develop the bill. In fact, she worked with John B. Gabrieli '16 to develop the bill, and with HKS students Catherine M. "Cici" Coquillette and Elyse N. Voegeli to garner support for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least five student groups will lose their current office spaces in the Student Organization Center at Hilles as part of a College effort to reduce the number of SOCH office occupants—and reconsider the broader use of at least two floors of the building—by the end of the semester.
Members of the Harvard Pops Orchestra, comedy group On Harvard Time, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association said administrators recently informed their respective groups they would be relocated to new offices elsewhere in the building. Members of the Harvard Republican Club and the Harvard College Democrats said their organizations have been kicked out of the SOCH entirely.
Members of all five groups said they learned of these developments via emails sent by Harvard administrators in the past few weeks. According to an April 9 email sent to one student group by Fellow for Student Organizations and the SOCH Joseph P. Flanagan, “many student organizations” will either lose office space in the SOCH or will be reassigned to a new location in the facility.
“Many organizations have lost space entirely,” Flanagan wrote in the email. “Unfortunately, some difficult decisions needed to be made.”
The SOCH, located in the Quad, contains over 50,000 square feet of space designated for meeting rooms, office and storage space, conference facilities, and common spaces, according to the Office of Student Life website. Multiple undergraduate groups use the SOCH either for headquarters or for office space.
Flanagan wrote in the April 9 email that the push to relocate or remove student groups from the SOCH stems from a “larger directive by the College to reduce” the number of SOCH office occupants. He added the College plans to evaluate the broad usage of the second and third floors of the SOCH.
“The SOCH has been put in a position to reduce the number of student organization offices, and as a result, all student organizations are being moved and consolidated to the third floor,” he wrote.
Alexander R. Miller, the Office of Student Life’s associate dean of student engagement, wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that the College is currently executing a reorganization of the SOCH.
“We are currently in the process of implementing a data-based plan which will provide more community spaces and better storage for students,” he wrote. “In the meantime, all groups will be able to continue operating in their current locations through the end of the academic year.”
Flanagan wrote in the April email that administrators are using several criteria to determine which groups lose their SOCH office space. He wrote staffers are weighing groups’ applications to use SOCH rooms as well as “the current physical conditions of the office” and “usage data.”
Flanagan did not specifically define what this data entailed in his email, but he wrote that one group—the group headed by the student who received his email—had only “entered the space fifteen times this academic year.” Given other groups had used their offices “between fifty and five hundred times in that same time period,” Flanagan wrote, this particular group deserved to be relocated to a new space in the SOCH.
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, president of the College Democrats, said administrators told his group members would be given until early May to move out of their current office.
“It seemed as though we had received, more or less, a form email that was probably sent to other students, informing us that we would be offered some moving supplies to help us move our personal effects out of the SOCH office, and letting us know the deadline,” Freeland said. “But that was essentially it.”
Freeland said the College Democrats use their SOCH office space frequently to work on their new podcast series, and that the space had served as a home base for their canvassing efforts during campaign season.
Kiera E. O’Brien ’20, the president of the Harvard Republican Club, said she and other club members are disappointed the group has lost its SOCH space.
“It is a huge hardship for our club, since we don’t have any other space to our name,” O’Brien wrote in an emailed statement.
On Harvard Time will move to a larger office but will have to share that room with multiple other student groups, according to its executive producer Julius Z. R. Wade ’20.
Wade said he was unsure if the move would end up being positive for the group.
“The new office that they assigned us is a fairly large office in the corner of the SOCH, which was what I specifically requested in the application, so I’m pleased because of that,” Wade said. “But in the application, I also specified that because of the nature of the work that On Harvard Time does—having lots of expensive equipment and stuff—it would be best to have our own office.”
“I’m hoping that it all works out fine,” he added.
Harvard Pops Orchestra Co-President Leah U. Rosen ’19 said Pops has had its own office in the SOCH for “as long as I can remember.”
Rosen added the group uses its office to store more than two decades’ worth of expensive sheet music, which the organization archives in order to avoid buying new copies of the same songs.
Now, Rosen said, Pops has been assigned to share the space with other performing arts groups.
“I’m worried that we’ll have less storage space, or that we’ll have to battle with other groups,” Rosen said. “Because the music is so expensive, we are really careful about not losing anything and being really organized with it.”

Alan M. Dershowitz, professor of law emeritus at Harvard Law School, dined with President Donald Trump Tuesday and spoke to White House officials about the Middle East this week, he said in an interview Wednesday.
Dershowitz, who has established himself as a loud defender of the president’s legal rights, met with Trump's staff Tuesday to discuss peace talks in the Middle East. He later ate dinner with Trump and other guests before meeting with officials again the next day.
Dershowitz said he received an invitation from the White House over a week ago to visit and share his thoughts on the Middle East.
“More than a week ago I was invited to the White House to discuss with his staff people the Middle East peace process," Dershowitz said. "This is the third meeting I’ve had with them about the Middle East peace process."
Dershowitz said he is “very close” to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and that he has also met with Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority. Dershowitz, who wrote a book entitled “The Case for Israel” in 2003, advocates a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Dershowitz emphasized Wednesday that he has advised several past presidents on Middle East policies and will continue to do so.
“I previously advised President Obama. I previously advised President Clinton. I met with President Bush the second and President Carter about the Middle East. So I’ve discussed the Middle East with almost every president for the last half a century,” Dershowitz said.
On Twitter, Dershowitz wrote, “I have discussed the Mideast with every president since Bill Clinton. I will continue to do so as long as the president will listen.”
Dershowitz said Trump invited him to dinner as a “courtesy.”
The meeting came as Trump is mulling whether to strike Syria in the wake of a chemical attack last weekend that killed 70 and injured hundreds. Trump has blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the attack.
Asked whether he discussed Syria with Trump, Dershowitz replied, “Can’t tell you.”
Trump appeared to signal Wednesday morning that he would order air strikes against Syria, tweeting that missiles “will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” On Wednesday evening, though, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration has not yet decided what course of action to take.
Dershowitz said the purpose of his meeting with Trump had nothing to do with Monday's FBI raid on the offices of Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. The FBI seized some of Cohen's business records, emails, and documents as part of that raid, according to the New York Times.
“It was a complete total coincidence that it happened the day after the raid on the office of his lawyer," Dershowitz said. "It was scheduled more than a week before."
During the dinner, Trump and Dershowitz mainly discussed the Middle East, Dershowitz said. Asked if any other topics cropped up, Dershowitz responded that he is “not [Trump’s] lawyer.”
“All I can tell you is I am not his lawyer. I have no legal-client relationship with him and I would never offer legal advice or give legal advice to somebody who was not my client,” Dershowitz said.
Despite frequently making the legal case for Trump’s actions in the press, Dershowitz maintained in the interview that he is not a defender of the president.
“I have never defended Donald Trump. I have only defended his constitutional rights and the constitutional rights laws,” Dershowitz said. “I’ve defended the rights of people who are subjects of investigation not to have their lawyers’ offices raided and their private, confidential communications read. That’s my position."
"But I’m not an advocate for Trump or a lawyer for Trump,” he added.
Dershowitz also said he has not been offered a position on Trump’s legal team and has no plans to legally advise Trump formally or informally in the future.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its last true test before the Ivy League championships, Harvard women’s golf completed a roaring comeback to take home the trophy at the Harvard Invitational for its first win in the competition since October 2013. Although played over 1,000 miles away at The Oaks Club near the Gulf of Mexico, the hosts felt right at home for the Harvard Invitational.
For the second straight tournament, gradual improvement over the course of the contest characterized the weekend. In this case, Harvard’s upward trend into Sunday would pay off in the form of a valiant come-from-behind victory.
The Crimson finished the first round of the tournament at 310 strokes, 22 over par for the day. This put Harvard in fifth place heading into the second round, but the Crimson was not deterred.
Harvard exploded in the second round, jumping five spots to tie Princeton for first place at a round-best 300 strokes. After topping the field on Saturday, the Crimson took care of business recording 292 strokes, its best round of the weekend.
Its impressive Sunday placed Harvard alone atop the leaderboard, three strokes ahead of Delaware, whose tournament-best score of 290 strokes in the final round came up just short for the Blue Hens.
Leading the Crimson charge on the final day was junior Michelle Xie, who recorded the only sub-70 score of the weekend in the final round. Shooting three under par, Xie’s 69 strokes topped Harvard and the whole field for the entire tournament.
With Xie went the Crimson, as the junior improved throughout the weekend. On every hole except for hole 14, Xie turned every bogeyed hole into either a par or birdie. This included turning her second round bogey of pesky hole 15, the hardest hole in the tournament for the field, into a par in her impressive final round. Her opening round 78 was followed with a one stroke improvement on Saturday at five over par, but Xie then exploded on the final day to sprint up the leaderboard and finish tied for seventh at eight over par for the tournament.
Senior captain Lita Guo also rode an upward trend on the weekend. Akin to Xie and the rest of Harvard, Guo’s scores improved as the tournament progressed. The Crimson captained finished the first round with an uncharacteristic 80 strokes at eight over par, but quickly settled in to produce stellar rounds on Saturday and Sunday by recording scores at two over par and three over par, respectively.
Xie and Guo were among multiple bright spots in a victorious weekend for Harvard. Freshman Belinda Hu continued her impressive 2017-2018 campaign tied for fifth place for the tournament. Hu led the Crimson over the course of the weekend at seven over par.
Hu’s best round was on Friday, when she shot even par for the course. This opening day performance was highlighted by an impressive six birdies, a feat that no other golfer was able to match on the weekend.
Harvard’s first tournament victory of the season could not have come at a more opportune time, as the Harvard Invitational was the final contest before the all-important Ivy League Championships. Following a well-earned week off, the Crimson will compete for the conference crown.
Last season, Harvard came up short as the Tigers ran away with the conference championship. The Princeton victory ended a five-year reign atop the Ivy League for the Crimson, who will look to reclaim the Ancient Eight’s throne. By finishing first among five of the seven Ivy League squads participating at the Invitational, Harvard will hope to replicate this week’s triumphant results with the conference crown on the line.

Anybody who goes to watch a Harvard women’s basketball game leaves knowing who Katie Benzan is. Weaving around screens and firing three-pointers with fervor, the sophomore guard moves with the speed and energy of a whirling dervish, bringing the Lavietes Pavilion crowd to its feet every time she makes a play.
On the heels of a stellar rookie season, Benzan made the Ivy League record books this season by knocking down 99 three-pointers, the most by any woman in Ancient Eight history. The new record just surpassed the previous mark of 97 three-pointers, set by Courtney Banghart in 1998-99.
Banghart, who set the record during her time at Dartmouth, just completed her 11th season at the helm of the Princeton women’s basketball team. Helping to push Princeton to an NCAA tournament berth this season, Banghart’s perspective on Benzan’s accomplishment, as a former player and current coach, is a unique one.
“Katie is a really special talent,” Banghart said. “She has a very quick trigger, and it’s very accurate. In the game, as a high volume shooter, you have to have a short memory—this fearlessness to you. If you miss one, the next one’s going in, and she certainly has that mentality.”
Benzan has always been clear about putting personal accolades behind the success of the team.
“I don’t really think about stats,” Benzan said. “Someone might tell me, but ten seconds later I’ll forget. I just want to win. That’s why I came here. But it is nice to hear.”
The selflessness and maturity that the point guard has demonstrated through the first half of her Crimson career has impressed fans and teammates alike. But Benzan’s team-first mentality is appreciated by Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, above all else.
“She’ll be the first one to tell you, it’s all about winning,” Delaney-Smith said. “Her personal accolades just come second to winning. That is the most important characteristic to help build a winning team.”
Only two seasons in, Benzan has left a sizable imprint on the Harvard women’s basketball program, and will be an integral part of the postseason success that the Crimson hopes to find in the next two years. Listed at 5’6, the Wellesley, Mass., native is often the shortest player on the court, but her record breaking season should hardly surprise—after all, basketball is in her DNA.
Benzan grew up in a basketball family, fewer than 15 miles from Cambridge. The daughter of a college basketball player and a student-coach, the sophomore grew up sparring stiff competition in the form of her older brother Patrick, currently a rising senior on the Holy Cross basketball team.
“Growing up, basketball was always a part of family life,” Benzan said. “We’d always go out to the driveway and play two-on-two. Our family dinners would sometimes be sitting on the couch, watching basketball. Ever since I could walk, I have been playing.”
Benzan was a highly decorated high school player at Noble and Greenough, garnering three NEPSAC Class A Tournament MVP awards, two ISL MVP recognitions, and helping her high school team to a 125-8 record over her five years on the varsity team. In her senior season, Benzan was named the Gatorade Player of the Year for Massachusetts, an honor shared in the past by WNBA greats Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Candace Parker, and Lisa Leslie.
Outside of school, Benzan played Wellesley Youth League and AAU basketball under the coaching of her mother, Kim. When Katie enrolled at Noble and Greenough, Kim assisted head coach Alex Gallagher. Between its location, academics, and Benzan’s attachment to her family, Harvard became the perfect choice for the point guard.
“I am such a homebody,” Benzan said. “Honestly, I pretty much only considered schools in New England. But Harvard stood out because of the atmosphere, the people, the coaching staff. Everyone just cares so much.”
In her first season in Cambridge, Benzan knocked down 85 three-pointers, good enough for fifth all time in a season and most of any active player. Her six Rookie of the Week selections and a spot on the All-Ivy team were more than enough to force Banghart and other Ancient Eight coaches to hone in on the playmaker entering this season.
“She’s a huge part of what Harvard does, and we know that when we game plan,” Banghart said. “We try to crowd her as best we can, and get longer bodies on her, but if that kid gets an open look, it’s going in.”
Despite Banghart and the rest of the league’s efforts to neutralize Benzan, the rising junior still shot a torrid 50 percent conference percentage from deep and a 52 percent three-point mark at Lavietes Pavilion. Entering the second half of her career, Benzan is on pace to not only break the all-time Ivy record for career three pointers, but shatter it by a healthy margin. The current record is 273, also set by Banghart, and Benzan has already tallied 184 triples.
Benzan’s impact on the Crimson stretches far beyond mere three-point shooting. At almost every whistle, the sophomore can be seen urgently huddling and talking excitedly to teammates, with the maturity and poise often reserved for a senior captain. Benzan’s play and leadership are inextricably attached to Harvard’s success.
“Katie is so much more than just a shooter, to be honest,” Delaney-Smith said. “She can score on many different levels. She has tremendous IQ and a terrific skill set… She’s a real leader on the floor, with a true passion and love for the game, which is the most important thing.”
The postseason awards logically followed Benzan’s high-flying season. As was announced in March, the league office named Benzan to the first-team All-Ivy—the only unanimous selection on the team. In the classroom, the Psychology concentrator was also selected to the 2018 Winter Academic All-Ivy League team.
For the rising junior, the frustration of this season’s heartbreakingly narrow loss to Penn in the Ivy League Tournament is clearly palpable.
“In the spring and summer, we just have to keep working and getting better,” Benzan said. “Every day, just a little bit better, so that come next March, when we’re hopefully at the Ivy League tournament again, all that work can help us beat whoever we’re playing. It starts right now.”
One thing remains certain. While the rising junior might smile graciously and politely thank all who congratulate her on records broken and who mention ones that Wellesley, Mass., native may break in the future, her focus is concentrated in one place.
As Benzan enters her junior and senior seasons at the helm of the Crimson offense and at the heart of the team, her desires boil down to helping the team win and returning Harvard to its first NCAA Tournament since 2007.
