After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Everyone back home who I’d ever seen go off to college would
finish up their finals, pack their bags, and head to our hometown for the
summer. They’d spend their summer days lifeguarding at the pool, waiting tables
at the restaurants they'd worked at during high school, or working a job at the
mall. They’d spend time with family and long nights catching up with high
school friends. Normal way to spend the summer, right?
But of course, Harvard kids never do things the normal way. 
I probably should have picked up the hint about Harvard
summers a lot quicker than I did. Maybe I should have picked it up when my
advising team started asking me about summer plans before I had even gone home
for J-term. Maybe I should have picked it up when every other conversation I
engaged in began with "What are your plans for the summer?" Maybe I
should have picked it up when I witnessed the people around me panic about applying
for summer funding.
But I brushed it all off. It was never a question for me that I was going to spend
my summer at home. After seven months away from my family, seven months of
papers and problem sets, seven months of comps and cuts, seven months of too
much stress and too little sleep, seven months of "Hey, how are
you?"s and "Good, and you?"s when no one is ever good, there was
no place I wanted to be but my own bed at home. Yes, I wanted an internship,
but don't people usually wait for the summer before senior year? Yes, I wanted
to study abroad, but don't I have plenty of time for that in the years to come? It didn't take me long to realize I was wrong. Soon, I
couldn't scroll down my Facebook newsfeed without a "Friends and family, I
am so blessed to announce (insert summer plan here)" post from a
classmate. My friends were booking their international flights and prepping for
funding interviews. Fellow freshmen were getting ready to walk the halls of
Twitter, Microsoft, and Google. Everyone around me was doing something, and I
was going home. 
Apparently, I didn't get the memo.
It seems like I didn't get the memo on a lot of things
essential to the Harvard experience. Like how it's cool to compete over who has
the most assignments and who is the most stressed out. Or how I'd have to lie
about my name to get into listed final club parties if I wanted to have a semi-decent
night out. Or how I should have had Ec10 and CS50 on my fall study card, and
how consulting is even a thing, much less something that I and everyone around
me should be interested in. The thing that confused me the most about Harvard culture was
how being busy to the point of breakdowns and tears seemed to be almost valued.
I didn't understand why getting the least amount of sleep the night before was
something to be proud of, and why mental health was always being compromised to
fit in an additional extracurricular activity. I couldn’t understand how no one
seemed to ever take a break.
I've been home for the summer for a couple of weeks now. I've
spent hours petting my dog and catching up on all the Netflix I didn't have
time for during the summer. I've enjoyed my mother's meals and my father's
company. I write this in the middle of the day, with eight year olds running
around me playing a game, while I am volunteering at a Girl Scout camp only 20
minutes down the road from where I grew up—the same camp I went to years ago.
And to be quite honest, I'm glad I didn't get the summer memo.

Ted Donato '91 and the Harvard men’s hockey team may have landed their next blue-line playmaker in 18-year old Adam Fox. Now the Calgary Flames may have done the same.
The Flames officially added Fox to their mix Saturday morning, selecting the incoming Harvard freshman in the third round of the NHL Entry Draft, 66th overall. Fox is now one of seven NHL draft selections on the Crimson’s roster for the 2016-2017 season.
Fox becomes the 19th player—and just the sixth defenseman—in Harvard history to be chosen in the first three rounds of the draft. As a third-rounder in particular, he joins the company of past Harvard standouts like Lane MacDonald ’88-’89, Dominic Moore ’03, Alex Killorn ’12, and Jimmy Vesey ’16, the latter of whom was also selected 66th overall.
An attack-minded defenseman from Jericho, N.Y., Fox verbally committed to Harvard when he was just 15, two years before his draft stock began ascending during his time with the United States National Team Development Program. Last season with the U18 team, Fox set a USNTDP single-season record for D-men with 59 points (nine goals, 50 assists) in 64 games, including seven contests at the U18 World Championships in April. There, Fox was named the tournament’s top defenseman for his nine-point performance (one goal, eight assists) as the United States won bronze.
Now the right-handed defenseman will shift his focus to the college game, where he’s set to join a defensive core in desperate need of an offensive threat. Last season, Clay Anderson’s 15 points marked a high among Crimson blue-liners, and no defenseman surpassed four goals for the season. Fox should have an opportunity to produce right off the bat, but ultimately how the 5’10” freshman holds up in the defensive zone will determine what kind of ice time he sees in his first collegiate season.

Harvard rising senior Nikki Okwelogu’s track and field resume continues to grow.
The Crimson athlete took home the African Championships discus title at the 20th rendition of the event, capturing her first ever gold medal at the international level while competing for Nigeria. In addition to the discus title, Okwelogu also took home second place in her main event, the shot put. 
The Fresno, Calif. native continued an impressive trend of personal best marks, throwing the discus 56.75 meters, which also topped the school record she set earlier in her career. The throw was over a meter further than teammate and second place finisher Chinwe Okoro– who holds the current Nigerian record in the event.
After claiming her first event, the success continued for Okwelogu in the shot put, tossing 17.07 meters. The rising senior was one of only two athletes that managed to throw further than 16 meters and landed just over half a meter behind the mark set by Cameroon’s Auriol Dongmo, who took home the crown.
While Okwelogu’s shot put mark was good for runner-up, it was far from her personal best.
The Fresno, Calif. native threw a career best 17.91 meters at the NCAA East Region Championships in May to take home the meet title and set a new personal, school, and Ancient Eight record. The mark also exceeded the Olympic qualifying standard, allowing Okwelogu to represent Nigeria in the shot put at the 2016 Olympics in Rio De Janeiro this summer.

For those of you whose wallets have been drained by late-night runs to Chipotle for burritos or slightly healthier (but not really) burrito bowls, don’t worry because your favorite pseudo-Mexican food joint is unveiling a new summer rewards program.
Until the end of September, “Chiptopia” will provide free food and merchandise to loyal and frequent customers. You can pick up your Chiptopia card starting on July 1 and swipe it with every Chipotle purchase above $6, about the price of a burrito with no extras. After four swipes, you will achieve “mild” status and earn a free entrée.
Four additional purchases in the same month will result in another free entrée and “medium” status. I don’t know about you, but I’ve always wanted to be recognized for the copious, perhaps irresponsible, sum of money I’ve spent at Chipotle. But the rewards don’t end there! If you make three more purchases, all within the same month, you will be awarded “hot” status along with—you guessed it—a third free entrée.
Only the most dedicated among us will qualify for the final round of prizes. If you achieve “mild” status all three months, you will win another free entrée (if that’s still appealing by October). If you make it to “medium” each month, you get $20 worth of Chipotle merchandise (to compliment all your Harvard gear). Finally, if you eat Chipotle 11 times a month for three months straight, you will win Chipotle catering for 20 people (valued at $240!).
Some theorize that this program only serves to rehabilitate Chipotle’s reputation after the restaurant's brush with E. coli last year, but hey, why not take advantage of free food?
