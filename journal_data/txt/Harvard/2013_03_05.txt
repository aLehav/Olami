Though Trevor Powers, the man behind Youth Lagoon, is just releasing his sophomore album, his musical aesthetic already seems to be set in stone. “Wondrous Bughouse” continues Powers’ traditional atmospheric sound, which he creates with bright, sometimes ethereal synths and understated vocals. There are places, however, where “Wondrous Bughouse” breaks away from the strategy set by Youth Lagoon’s debut, “The Year of Hibernation.” It more readily embraces dissonance and distortion, which make it an album that is not always beholden to the conventions of synth-pop. However, the album does stumble on its more pointed deviations. Ultimately, Powers’ musical experiments within the context of his established sound allow him to produce an album that, if nothing else, delivers a unique but unrefined experience filled with ambient whimsy and delightfully confusing innovation.
In his first track, “Through Mind and Back,” Powers forcefully reveals the principle-breaking evolution upon which he continues to draw on throughout the album. The song begins with overt dissonance, and as the purely instrumental track progresses, creaky twangs are layered over a bed of deep reverberations, until the track eventually devolves into what sounds like nothing more than the whirring of machines. Even so, the song is an efficacious introduction to the album, almost serving as a preparatory period for the more experimental tracks to come.
Indeed, Powers builds directly from the oddity of “Through Mind and Back” with the next two tracks in the album, creating an experimental trio of songs. The rather mystifying note choices from “Through Mind and Back” are reflected in the second track, “Mute,” which employs distorted synths to disrupt the otherwise pleasant melody and make complacency all but impossible. This insistence on active listening continues with the next song, “Attic Doctor,” which is in the ever-unexpected triple meter. The effect of these eccentric musical decisions is the creation of a paradoxical sound—these songs feel like ambient noise even as they refuse to fade into the background.
Though Powers never completely reverts to compositions akin to those of “The Year of Hibernation,” the album does become less dissonant and more charismatic as it continues. Powers still hints at discordance and throws in another song in triple meter, “Daisyphobia,” but the peculiarity is limited enough that “Wondrous Bughouse” remains an intersection of curiosity and approachability. The epitome of this interchange is the penultimate track, “Raspberry Cane,” which combines moments of light distortion, an extremely catchy vocal and instrumental melody, and a solid beat that carries the song along for much of its six minutes.
This pop-like catchiness, however, should not be a cue to disregard the album thematically. The sugary synths create a platform for surprisingly existential and oblique lyrics. The songs almost exclusively concern themselves with self-reflexive thinking. In “Mute,” Powers sings, “The devil tries to take my mind / But I can’t quite get inside.” Fittingly, Powers’ verses on this track—which are difficult to decipher auditorily—are almost opaque in their meaning as well. Powers takes this insistence on lyrical and melodic cloudiness too far in “Wondrous Bughouse,” though, to the point that a vast majority of the lyrics are incomprehensible without re-listen after re-listen. In fact, the major flaw of this album is the extremes to which it takes what are fundamentally good ideas. At points in the first track the dissonance becomes excessive and overwhelms the forward momentum, and the triple meter of “Attic Doctor,” particularly the painful emphasis of the first beat, is so strongly pronounced that it becomes nauseating by the end.
It is true that Powers has a great album on his hands. It is also true that it could have benefited from critical revision so that its fantastic concepts could be expressed with more moderation.  Powers took a major step toward releasing his creative potential on “Wondrous Bughouse,” but because of his failure to properly harness his raw, imaginative energy, he has created an album whose inventiveness is compromised by its overstriving.

“Gotta Get Over”
Eric Clapton, "Old Sock"
In the 1960s, Eric Clapton’s bluesy licks and funky jams elicited cries of  “Clapton is God” from his rabid fans. On his new single  “Gotta Get Over,” Clapton revisits these core elements to create a track strikingly reminiscent of his earlier works. The song immediately establishes an upbeat, blues tempo, and the musical fire never dies. Clapton also fashions an impressive mid-piece guitar solo, and the live-performance feel that the song elicits with gospel singers and randomly interjected laughter, harkens back to classics of the past. But it is really the jazzed-up, Fender-filled finale in the original Claptonian fashion that makes this single one of his best recent works. The god is back, and he’s wearing his old socks.
"One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)"
One Direction
Whereas fangirls will swoon over One Direction’s rendition of Blondie’s classic song, more mature—and less obsessed—listeners may be disappointed. For one, the lyrics, which worked well in the hands of charming Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry, seem utterly disturbing for a boy band. “And if your lights are all out / I’ll follow your bus downtown / See who’s hanging out,” the group sings at one point. Essentially an instruction manual for the art of stalking, the lyrics distract from the otherwise decent vocal performances. Furthermore, the interpolation of the mash-up between Blondie’s track and “Teenage Kicks,” by The Undertones, comes across as unoriginal. Although the band does deliver a catchy “na-na-na” sequence midway through the song, there is nothing new or exciting about One Direction’s interpretation.
"Box Chevy"
Rick Ross, "Mastermind"
Attempting to listen to Rick Ross’s newest track is, simply put, painful. In this lead single off his upcoming album “Mastermind,” Ross comes across as anything but. For one, the senseless profanity is distracting. A verse is not complete without multiple mentions of “nigga,” “fuckin,’” or “bitch.” And, of course, there is no shortage of “pussy,” which, long his favorite noun, has become Ross’s go-to adjective as well. Ross also unsuccessfully experiments with a new rhyming scheme, complete with words such as “Okechobee,” “Bartow,” and “okey dokey.” Ross’s gangster image will definitely take a hit with this one. But what really makes this single disappointing is the lack of a clear direction—boasting about buying “the blue Lexus,” and blowing up “pussy niggas,” Ross overlooks clarity and originality for clichés and tasteless word choices.

To title an album “XO” is a bold statement. A kiss and then a hug—a simple, casual valediction reserved for the closest relationships, the letters “xo” seem to be most at home carved into the weathered wood of park benches. “xo” means memories and being stuck between youth and growing up.
Fortunately, Elliott Smith was a master of devastatingly personal songwriting, and his 1998 album, named after the sweetest two letters to ever be left on a page, is both the salt and ointment to the wound of heartbreak. It’s an album about breaking up, but not just losing a lover; “XO” is an album about breaking up with someone you love and then breaking up with yourself. The 14 tracks could be considered an autobiography of sorts—from the casually impassioned “Sweet Adeline” to the defeated “I Didn’t Understand,” Smith explores every nook and cranny of his despondent and often sequestered mind.
Over the years, I’ve built a home among the most beautiful moments that populate “XO,” and the carpet is marked with Smith’s shoe prints. He taught me that breaking up with myself is easy to do. “Cut this picture into you and me / Burn it backwards, kill this history” are the lines that open the album, and this idea of forcibly excising something slowly evolves and takes on multiple meanings throughout the record. On “Waltz #2 (XO),” Smith’s repeated plea, “You’re no good, you’re no good, you’re no good” becomes one of the most matter-of-fact and cutting lines from the album. What better way to stop loving yourself than to convince yourself that you’re not worthwhile?
Despite the occasional stunningly delivered line, though, Smith isn’t an incredible lyricist. He creates an atmosphere dependent not on any particular phrase, but on the emotional pathos that saturates the album as a whole. Smith avoids detailed personal sketches that might isolate him from his listeners, making his music all the more relatable. Because of this accessibility, I gradually adopted “XO” to be a story about my own life. Elliott Smith and I had a long distance relationship, but the distance was more through time than through space. Ten years after the release of “XO,” Smith’s claim on the fifth track, “Pitseleh”—which lyrically  works to deconstruct the system of endictment in relationships—that “no one deserves it” helped me imagine a blameless world, safe from the accusations of others, but mostly from the accusations of myself. All people are too hard on themselves, and I knew that—but it was different hearing that assertion come out of someone else’s mouth. But throughout “XO,” Smith chooses to deny hope, instead sounding resigned and, occasionally, regretful. After all, he has nothing to prove—despite this album being his first on a major label, “XO” retains the close, intimate feel of the multi-instrumentalist’s solo work.
The album’s greatest strength is epitomized by the quiet piano intro to “Waltz #1,” which is marked by magical, shimmering overtones of the earlier waltz on the album. The sparsely amalgamated instruments provide the perfect backdrop to Smith’s characteristically double-tracked vocals, which themselves carry a certain honesty and sadness. A minute or two into the track, a single piano line accompanies his voice as he offers a striking lament, “What was I supposed to say?” It is in this moment that the album’s defining and greatest characteristic becomes clear—that, at the end of the day, the best word to describe the doubt-filled, ever-questioning “XO” might be “human.”
Being at a loss for words is not what you might expect from a songwriter, but it is this humble uncertainty that breathes life into “XO.” The moments that stuck most closely with me were when he seemed the most unsure—the ambiguous discontent of “Oh Well, Okay” and the glorified ambiguity in “A Question Mark.” Even the pop-influenced tracks such as “Bled White” that disappointed Smith’s biggest fans upon the release of “XO” retain a sense of intimate honesty. In truth, all of these tracks are organic products of a man whose career was born through raw emotion and acoustic guitar.
Although “XO” is an album that taught me the art of breaking up, it ultimately helped me put myself back together. At the very least, it helped me come to terms with the part of me that wanted things to fall apart and for me to forget. I wouldn’t be exaggerating very much if I said that every day comes with a reminder that I won’t be hearing from Elliott ever again—this October will be the 10-year anniversary of his death. Although two of Smith’s studio albums were released—one posthumously—after “XO,” I consider its final track, “I Didn’t Understand,” his goodbye, if not to the world, then at least to me. Sometimes, I revisit the album, but other times, the shoe prints on the carpet stop me from making it past the foyer. The freshest of them all is on this final track, when his voice tiredly declares through the warm blanket of a capella vocals, “There’s nothing here that you’ll miss, I can guarantee you this.”
Elliott, you couldn’t have been more wrong.

Park Chan-wook is one of several big Korean directors making their English-language debuts—Jee-woon Kim of “The Good, The Bad, The Weird” just released the Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle “The Last Stand,” and the thrillingly talented Joon-ho Bong has wrapped shooting on his new picture “Snowpiercer.” Park rose to prominence on the back of his “Vengeance Trilogy,” the second part of which, “Oldboy,” was a cracking success and is being remade by Spike Lee. Park’s own English-language debut, the gleefully overheated gothic potboiler “Stoker,” nods significantly to Hitchcock, but it has a style and strong performances that partially elevate it above other recent attempts to emulate the master of suspense.
With its funereal calm and measured pacing, “Stoker” initially seems a million miles away from the kinetic heat of “Oldboy.” Dig deeper, though, and this exercise in style is a pleasing evolution of Park’s visual palette. His eye for a shot and attention to detail occasionally border on the astonishing—combed hair dissolves into cornfields, a belt is drawn through trouser loops with painstaking deliberation, Nicole Kidman’s face contorts and stretches at weird angles. There’s a keen desire here for the viewer’s experience to be as tactile as possible—Park rejoices in leather, stone, and wine so red you can almost taste it, and he utilizes textures, colors, and a richness in the movement and composition of his shots that can’t help be pleasing on the eye.
Amid all this, the actual plot is almost irrelevant and doesn’t really kick into gear for a while. When it does, it’s pretty daft. India Stoker, well played by Mia Wasikowska—whose pale skin and luminous eyes receive much of Park’s most sustained attention—is a young girl, reserved and unpopular at school, whose father dies in a car accident. This precipitates the arrival at the funeral of his mysterious younger brother, Charlie (Matthew Goode). Charlie moves in with India and her mother, Evelyn (Nicole Kidman), and the relationship between daughter and uncle starts to develop in a sinister, vaguely sexual, and altogether unhealthy fashion.
There are various increasingly implausible plot twists and revelations that build up to an ending that must have seemed farcical on paper. It makes a kind of demented sense when allied to Park’s aesthetic, though, and the actors do a decent job of bringing some ludicrous material to life. Goode’s Charlie has a tan so perfect, his skin seems to glisten like a desert mirage, and he just about stays this side of creepy rather than being completely ridiculous.
It’s Wasikowska’s show, though, and she demonstrates again why she’s one of the current It girls of art house cinema, capturing excellently the gradual maturation of a repressed and standoffish adolescent. You can see why Park must have been so enamored of her face—it’s gigantic, as big as a dinner plate, but it hardly seems to move: Wasikowska can emote with the mere flick of an eyelash or twitch of the nose, and the camera can fix upon or glide around the brilliant, white surface of her face. She has the trick of being stunningly beautiful without obviously being so, a pretty uncommon trait among today’s actresses. Kidman, Jacki Weaver, and Dermot Mulroney all do good jobs in supporting roles, and the set, a big old house with many empty rooms and dark corners, winningly conjures up the gothic fairytales evoked in the movie’s title.
It’s just a pity then that the script couldn’t quite sustain the weight of Park’s directorial vision. A tale like this needs to veer off in directions we didn’t expect and give us a story worthy of the storytelling. Instead, “Stoker” is more interested in the inexorable fulfillment of the familiar ritual of the horror movie—ultimately a safe and unsurprising move. The reason Hitchcock was a genius was not his brilliance with a movie camera, but the fact that he was able to reinvent the same genre again and again. “Psycho,” which is directly referenced in “Stoker,” is just such a movie—it completely changes direction halfway through and shocks the audience out of the complacency with which they might go to see a “Hitchcock movie.” At the end of the day, “Stoker” doesn’t have the nous or the courage to do that, and so the comparison between the two films ceases to be a flattering one. This is fun but familiar—and that’s not scary.

On Friday night, the Hyperion Shakespeare Company put on a series of scenes from the Bard’s plays in Adams Pool Theatre. The decadence of the pool that existed, before its conversion to a small, intimate theater—and the tales of coed skinny-dipping and a few fabled orgies—is a stiff act to follow. Nevertheless, the dauntless Hyperion Shakespeare Company was the latest to take on such an endeavor and the verdict? Not bad. The Hyperion performed ten scenes, mostly well-known, from seven of Shakespeare’s plays, with all of the scenes based on the theme “Family Feud.” The production, which played through Saturday, isn’t going to win any awards as a whole, but ran refreshingly short and was supported by a solid, occasionally exceptional cast.
This performance consisted of a compilation of scenes, many with overlapping actors. The lights, set, and costumes were very plain, though not necessarily in a bad way; the simple construction lent itself well to a diverse range of scenes. Except for one spotlight on King Hamlet’s ghost, the lights were relatively uniform, with the actors always thoroughly lit. Costumes varied from character to character, ranging from completely black and white garb to conventional jeans and a T-shirt, for no easily discernible reason. Nonetheless, these choices were appropriate and contributed to a casual atmosphere in which the acting could stand on its own.
Despite the plain choices and simple production design, which could possibly have made the performance feel thrown together, a lack of technical errors revealed a capable but not extraordinary cast. The actors hit their cues and blocking and delivered their lines with attempted authenticity that is all the more difficult to pull off in iambic pentameter. However, the players did not in the end feel particularly authentic—certainly not spontaneous—and came off only as functional.
Despite the beige impression left by the cast, a few performances stood out. Caleb J. T. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts editor, impressed in scenes from both “King Lear” and “Measure for Measure.” In the “Lear” selection, Thompson played the aging king struggling to decide how to divide his land among three daughters. Thompson’s subtlety with a slight and convincing stammer added staccato to a rich vocal performance. In combination with a slightly bent posture, Thompson read as elderly and deteriorating, creating memorable character in what could otherwise be a flat scene to read, much less perform. As Claudio in “Measure for Measure,” imprisoned and waiting for execution, Thompson does not read so authentically as a man facing death, but he strikes a tone between grave and comic that “Measure” classically occupies, adding nice relief to a generally dour lineup.
Another surprising relief from the tragedy and bitter family feuding came from Alex B. Zaloum ’16, who portrayed Polonius from “Hamlet.” In this scene, Polonius delivers the famous line “Neither a lender nor a borrower be,” imparting advice to his son Laertes (Kevin T. Wittenberg ’14) and daughter Ophelia (Lelaina E. Vogel ‘15). Zaloum’s portrayal of Polonius worked—acting sharp and vaguely creepy—and added an unexpected layer of comedy. Zaloum was purposefully rigid and slow; working with his height and slight frame, he appeared eccentric but severe, and his voice was smooth and drawling. His character’s eccentricity and deliberate actions built a mounting tension until Ophelia defied him and he unexpectedly lost it, only briefly, in a personal screaming match against himself. Zaloum’s ability to build tension between his comedy, physical and vocal, and his unexpected severity made the performance stand out.
With a capable cast across the board and even some exceptional performances, the Hyperion’s scene recital was disappointing mainly because the theme did not seem to tie the scenes together fully. The themed scene recital is a brilliant idea—the performance was quick-paced and punchy, running just over an hour—but the theme, “Family Feud,” was too broad (though having brothers Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14, a Crimson arts editor, and Kevin Q. Hilgartner ’16 play mortally feuding brothers Edmund and Edgar from “King Lear” was quite clever). Familial issues are prominent in every play by the Bard, and this production would have would have excelled with a more specific theme that built from scene to scene. The acting in “Family Feud” was successful, but the weak connection between the scenes and the overarching, progressing theme made the end product somewhat superficial. Just a little more central direction could have made it into a wonderfully cohesive cycle of Shakespearean scenes. Nonetheless, it was easily accessible, and its short length and quick pace made the production quite enjoyable for a wide audience.

Storyteller Xanthe Gresham has been travelling the world and captivating audiences with her energetic, creative performances for almost 20 years. Her repertoire of stories spans a wide range of cultures and time periods, and she has performed everything from the “Epic of Gilgamesh,” one of the oldest surviving literary works, to her own contemporary storytelling pieces.  Gresham will be performing selections from the Persian epic “The Shahnama” today at the Sackler Museum, and will also be conducting a storytelling workshop at Arts @ 29 Garden tomorrow.
The Harvard Crimson: Was storytelling, or listening to stories being told, a big part of your childhood?
Xanthe Gresham: I studied literature at Oxford, so I've always read. But yeah, strangely enough, I had quite a strong church upbringing, and I always had to listen to a lot of Bible stories. Sometimes I feel like I ended up doing what I hated as a child—telling stories and using a lot of religious material.
THC: What would you say are the key skills a good storyteller needs to have?
XG: A good storyteller has to like stories. They have to need stories. As a child I used to like certain stories that I read again and again, and novels, and when I was at school I used to memorize poetry on my long walk to school…. You need that passion as a storyteller. You need to love language and playing with language.
THC: How much do your performances evolve and differ from past renditions of the same story?
XG: It really will be a different experience each time. Some of the stories are quite fixed, but others I improvise quite a bit more. With stories for children, I do a lot more improvisation, because they are more involved with the story….  And you're reading the audience’s reactions all the time and adapting your story. It’s very much like a conversation.... The [size] of the audience makes a big difference. The energy of the performance gets bigger with a bigger audience. When it’s a smaller audience, it's more intimate and more conversational.
THC: You work with a lot of different storytelling cultures and stories from all over the world. Do you ever feel a cultural disconnect to a story because you aren't from that area? How do you overcome that disconnect?
XG: I do. I overcome it through reading the text and [through] research like looking at museum artifacts. If a story speaks to you in your heart—it sounds sappy—and you work hard, then you can overcome the cultural differences…. It’s interesting because I'm only just coming to the U.K. myths, although I’m from the U.K. I've got a commission to do something with the Arthurian cycle, maybe about Morgan le Faye, this July. It’s so odd, because I've never been interested in my own culture and I studied all these stories from other cultures, and I followed them, and they brought me home.
THC: What will you be doing in your upcoming workshop at Harvard?
XG: My workshop is basically a storytelling class. I'll be discussing the little pockets of stories I know well and my experience storytelling. Storytelling has been a job for me but also a process that has helped me to work through various things in my life. And I'll be talking about practical ways to tell a story. Storytelling works because it triggers images in people’s minds and you have to work to build the world of the story through words…. It helps to be brave in storytelling, so I always encourage students to tell it in their own way and make it their own.

“I always thought of Harvard Square in the ’60s as like Paris in the ’20s,” says Steve R. Nelson, co-founder of the Music Museum of New England. Instead of novels and poetry, the Square’s dominant art form was music; its Stein and Hemingway were folk legends Joan Baez and Jim Kweskin. The ’50s and ’60s saw Harvard Square at the core of a massive folk revival, a musical movement that largely began with a ragtag group of college students from Boston and ultimately became a nationwide phenomenon.
The Square today, however, is a different story. Coffeehouses and clubs are now overshadowed by Grafton Group restaurants and clothing boutiques, as the Square has transformed from a hotbed of culture to an outdoor shopping center. Instead of going to music joints, Harvard students mostly stick to campus events. But hidden behind the towering Coop and CVS, music in the Square lives on, continuing the trajectory that began with the folk revival. The Harvard Square music scene may be hidden to some, but for music fans with enough dedication and interest, it’s subtly still making history.
SQUARE ONE
In the late ’50s, Boston was a thriving college town, and the melting pot of students in the area helped spark the folk music boom. “There were a lot of kids who came to [Boston University] that already were playing an instrument,” says Betsy M. Siggins, founder of the New England Folk Music Archives and a freshman at Boston University in 1958. Siggins was closely involved in the folk music scene; in fact, her earliest friends and roommates included Baez and Kweskin. In 1959, her eventual husband, Bob Siggins ’60, formed the Charles River Valley Boys, one of the era’s most successful roots music bands, composed of several Harvard and MIT students.
Folk music in the Square exploded in 1958 with the opening of Club 47. At 47 Mt. Auburn St., where Daedalus restaurant and Cambridge Cleaners sit today, the club became a hub for local and national artists seeking a place to play and interact with lovers of the music. The venue was called a “club” because it charged a one-dollar “member’s fee” at the door, and the operations of the club were a true team effort. “I did everything at Club 47, as we all did. Whatever needed doing, somebody just did it,” says Betsy Siggins, who moved to Club 47 from her previous job as a café waitress. “We put most [visiting musicians] up in our houses because we had no money for hotels.” Even the musicians pitched in; Peter Wolf, who would make his name as the J. Geils Band’s lead singer, was a club regular in the late ‘60s and lent his apartment out as a dressing room for club performers.
Bill G. Nowlin, founder of Cambridge roots label Rounder Records, says that Harvard Square’s easy accessibility from a variety of colleges set it apart as a popular destination for musicians and listeners alike. Nowlin was a music-loving Tufts student in those days, and he would often trek down to Cambridge multiple nights a week to enjoy shows at Club 47. “[The club was] not forbidding,” he says. Its grassroots character allowed cash-strapped college students to make live music a part of their weekly routines.
The club’s beginnings coincided with national trends. Across the country, college campuses were becoming key to protests and other social movements. For students in Boston seeking mediums for activism, the Square and its performance venues were a perfect fit. “[The Square] was one of those epicenters of this cultural explosion that was going on,” Nelson says. The club also capitalized on the rising popularity of authentic American roots music across the country. Club 47 set up a system with the Newport Folk Festival: the festival would book Southern artists, and to make the trips more lucrative the artists would play two shows—one at the festival and one at Club 47. In later years, many visiting artists at the club veered away from folk towards blues and R&B; Nelson remembers seeing artists like Muddy Waters and Mississippi John Hurt on the lineup alongside acoustic songsters.
While Club 47 was the center of the Cambridge scene, it certainly wasn’t all of it. Tulla’s Coffee Grinder on Mt. Auburn St.—an early venue for Baez, though now closed—and Nameless Coffeehouse, still residing on Church St. were among the many venues into which local folk musicians, blues singers, and singer-songwriters spilled. The scene was sprawling but low-key, perhaps the perfect combination for young up-and-comers. “[Bob] Dylan was playing in Boston for $2.50 a ticket, and I don’t mean $250,” Betsy Siggins says. In fact, Club 47 once refused the future superstar a booking, allowing the then-unknown artist to play only during another performer’s intermission. Dylan only spent a short time in Cambridge, but he stands nevertheless among the many musicians—such as Pete Seeger and Joni Mitchell—who rocketed from the Square to stardom.
CAMBRIDGE’S “ENGINE ROOM”
The folk renaissance began to quiet as the ’60s drew to a close. The spotlight shifted away from the Square as bands like the Modern Lovers—featuring Harvard students Ernie Brooks ’71 on bass and Jerry Harrison ’71 on keys—found new homes at clubs like the South End’s Boston Tea Party, which Nelson managed for a time. These groups took their cues from the Velvet Underground rather than folk and blues-rock, and it was in Boston’s rock clubs rather than Cambridge’s coffeehouses that they began contributing to the punk movement.
But music in Harvard Square far from faded away. Venues came and went, including the original House of Blues, which opened in 1992 but moved to a bigger location near Fenway in 2003. Club 47, after moving to a Palmer St. basement and being shut down by the police, was reopened as Club Passim in 1969. Live music can be found at various restaurants in Cambridge, and upscale jazz has a home at the Charles Hotel’s Regattabar, but Passim is still a focal point for folk, blues, rock and more, sharing this position—as of December 2012—with the Square’s newest music venue, the Sinclair.
Though they are located just a few blocks down Church Street from each other, Passim and the Sinclair seem worlds apart. Passim was built from the ground up by locals, while the Sinclair is just one of many venues operated by New York’s Bowery Presents organization. While Passim is a 100-seat basement with unclothed tables and vegetarian food—the club doubles as the dining room for Veggie Planet during the day—the Sinclair is a 500-capacity standing-room rock club with a gourmet restaurant added on next door. It is, in fact, these drastic differences that keep the two clubs from butting heads.
Passim sets itself apart by tapping into the rich, local tapestry of genres available in Cambridge. “Boston is not really known as a music city…the way Nashville is or Austin is,” says Dan B. Hogan, executive director of Passim. “[The scene is] so eclectic…. we don’t have a label here, and we don’t produce music here, but we have musicians here of all sorts.” Indeed, Boston may not be pumping out hit singles, but the New England Conservatory, Berklee College of Music, and the cornucopia of schools in town are constantly turning out young artists with a variety of musical interests.
Passim’s managing director Matt W. Smith, who has spent almost two decades at Passim and is an avid patron of live music himself, believes that the scene owes much to Boston music fans, who he maintains are some of the best in the country. “If we put on a good show on a Monday night, we’re going to have a sold-out crowd,” he says. “It’s a very discerning audience, and that’s a good thing.”
A larger phenomenon may be enforcing Passim’s pull—people are interested in acoustic music again. Recent years have seen folk-inspired bands like Mumford & Sons, the Lumineers, the Avett Brothers, and more rise to an international stage. To some, this is a distasteful trend. “There’s going to be a backlash,” Smith says, referring to “purists” who normally enjoy folk music but might be turned off by said bands’ mainstream success.
But Hogan thinks that Passim will stand out as an intimate refuge from the huge arenas frequented by the most popular of these bands. “[Music fans] are going to see that Passim’s an alternative,” he says.
While Smith estimates that over half of Passim’s shows feature local talent, the Sinclair brings in all national acts to headline. But like Passim, the Sinclair seems to be benefiting from its diverse programming. “Whether it’s Mission of Burma, a Boston punk institution…or Jessie Ware, a really up-and-coming British soul/R&B type act, you get a completely different crowd,” says Josh Bhatti, who manages the Sinclair as well as other Bowery Presents venues. This variety has served the club well in its first month of life. “By and large we’ve been surpassing expectations,” Bhatti says.
Their club and Passim have a symbiotic relationship. “I think [the Sinclair is] going to draw people into the Square who like music,” Hogan says. “And then they’re going to see Passim, which they may not know about.”
Smith loves hearing when artists who have performed at Passim end up playing at larger venues like the Sinclair. “That’s what we’re here for,” Smith says. “We’re here as this…engine room to get people going.” It’s an ideal match; the Sinclair draws people to the Square with recognized acts, and Passim offers them a cozy alternative and a place to see local bands before they reach national audiences.
Smith acknowledges that there have been and will be down times in the music industry, but he firmly believes that the scene’s lulls are often just transitions, such as when the ’90s singer-songwriter scene dissipated but ultimately gave way to a new generation of bands that favored post-grunge and pop punk. In these situations, it is up to clubs to keep on the lookout for the next big thing. Passim has ridden the choppy waves of popular trends for years—outlasting many other venues that have come and gone—and the Sinclair seems to be following a similar plan with its multifaceted programming.
STUDENT ABSENCE
With Passim and the Sinclair working together to offer a little bit of everything, it would seem Harvard Square is still a paradise for music lovers, if not quite on the scale that it once was. Yet with everything going on, students may not be listening.
“Nowadays, a lot of people are stuck in the familiarity circle,” music director for the Harvard Callbacks Cynthia S. Meng ’15 says. Meng is a music lover who enthusiastically consumes soul and R&B music. She attends several concerts a year: this year, she headed into Boston to see Mumford & Sons, the Avett Brothers, and Esperanza Spalding. But she has never been to—in fact, had never before heard of—Passim or the Sinclair. Meng says current students don’t want to take the risk spending money on something unknown. “They’re going to save up, they’re going to splurge on something they can go and buy merchandise for [and] Instagram pictures of,” she says.
“When I go out I tend to see more older people than younger people,” Nowlin says.
Looking at contemporary youth, he sees students more distracted by other forms of entertainment. “A lot of people today don’t really care about seeing live music,” he says. Instead, many young music fans remain content listening to music on their computers. He also believes more is expected of students today than was in the ’60s. “People have to work harder than we had to, so they don’t have much free time to begin with.” As Meng says, it is only for chart-toppers that most students will fork over their time—and the cash—for tickets. This might work in the Sinclair’s favor: Harvard students frequent the larger venue, and its shows feature recognizable national bands. Few, by contrast, have seen the intimate interior of Passim.
The low student draw is not for lack of trying on the club’s part. Passim has created several initiatives over the years to raise awareness on campus; recent collaborations include a concert on the Science Center Plaza and a performance of the play “Woody Sez,” in the Square with live music to supplement a simulcast from the American Repertory Theater. Hogan is also considering offering cheap student rush tickets through the Harvard Box Office, in the hopes that students will be more inclined to purchase tickets through a familiar avenue.
When asked about the effectiveness of this plan, Meng says, “Maybe.” The thriftiness of students extends to on-campus events—Meng says that she has trouble selling Callbacks concert tickets even to friends. She does think that students are more likely to attend on-campus shows, though. “Part of that has to do with knowing the students,” she says. Passim does book student bands, which could possibly draw out students to see their peers. However, the majority of these acts come from music schools such as Berklee, and therefore do little to draw the Harvard crowd.
BEYOND THE BRICK WALL
Despite the lack of student interest, Passim and the Sinclair seem safe for now. In fact, the very technologies that seem to be distracting the young are instrumental in connecting what is now a fairly spread-out community of listeners. “On any given night, any venue could be the heart of the Boston music scene,” Bhatti says. He cites modern social media sites as essential tools for spreading the word about upcoming events. “It’s palpable when there’s a show in town that has all the buzz in the world,” he says. “You go on Facebook, you go on Twitter, and…that night, that’s the venue to be at.” Students may be spending less time at concerts, but those few who are curious about music have everything at their disposal to discover what’s going on.
While Harvard Square is no longer as central a hub as it was in the ’60s, the area’s music is alive, thriving and more diverse than ever—no longer the heart but a strong arm of Boston’s extensive scene. But in this new age, as Smith sees it, students will be responsible for keeping live music popular. “Dare to check out new things,” Smith says. “That’s the best thing for everyone.”

“As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a monstrous vermin,” begins Franz Kafka’s novella “The Metamorphosis,” quickly sliding from the mundane to the nightmarish. Vesturport Theatre and Lyric Hammersmith Theatre’s stage adaptation at Paramount Center Mainstage began in a similar, eerie fashion—the Samsa family’s morning bustle was interrupted by the flash of a beetle silhouette, hinting at the change that had taken place. With a creative take on portraying Gregor’s transformation and a set that channeled the creepiness of the Kafka’s original story, the production, which closed on Sunday, had a powerful aesthetic design. The actors were all from Iceland, and it is perhaps this language barrier that prevented many of the lines from reaching their full emotional potential. The show also faltered in the static acting of the performers, making the other elements a mere carapace for a production with a hollow emotional core.
The choice to leave Gregor (Gísli Ö. Gardarsson) as a human instead of decking him out in a beetle costume was consistent with Kafka’s wishes—the author explicitly instructed his cover illustrator not to depict Gregor’s transformation, preferring to leave it to the reader’s imagination. Indeed, the original German version never even specifies that Gregor has become an insect, referring to him with an old German word meaning “unclean animal.” Instead of going for a literal depiction, the production opted for a different way to create an air of menace: Gardarsson crawled across the walls, flipped through the air, and perched eerily on furniture. His performances were both breathtaking and unnerving—in one scene, Gardarsson hung upside-down while speaking calmly, the blood visibly rushing to his head. The decision to use this acrobatic scuttling as a means to represent Gregor’s beetle form without actually outfitting him with a shell and wings provided an unsettling alternative to the literal depiction of a beetle.
The set and the cast’s interactions with it proved to be one of the highlights of the production. While most of the house was typical and modest, when it came to Gregor’s bedroom, set designer Börkur Jonsson unleashed his dark creativity: the room was at a perpendicular to the rest of the set, with the “floor” facing the audience where the back wall should have been. The walls were studded with crannies that Gardarsson grabbed on to when clambering around. Rather than providing a mere backdrop for the action, then, the set was an integral part of the production, playing up the sinister poetry of Kafka’s original. The pinnacle of this successful cooperation was the flight scene, in which Gregor resolves to leave the family that he has caused so much harm. With golden light streaming into the dark room through the many holes in the wall, Gardarsson entwined himself in one of the curtains and, suspended in midair, gave Gregor’s gymnastic swan song, a wordless performance that conveyed his pain while maintaining a sense of effortless grace.
The strongest components of the production were those that were nonverbal; however, cracks started to appear when it came to the acting. The language barrier, which led to unnatural line breaks and inflection, made it hard for the Icelandic cast to emote. The acting itself was exaggerated as well, sometimes to a painful degree. Particularly overwrought were the scenes with the lodger, Herr Fischer (Vikingur Kristjánsson), whom the family received with cringe-inducing shouted toasts. Later on, trying to disguise her affection for their guest, Greta (Selma Björnsdóttir) snapped to attention clownishly and barked orders at him. Because the characters’ emotions seemed to be over the top at all times, their relationships were sapped of their power, and the decay of their interactions over time was not as moving as it should have been. The cast would do well to remember the mantra “less is more”—as Gregor’s mother, Edda Arnljótsdóttir was most affecting when sitting at the foot of the stairs and weeping softly over the loss of her son, but her awkward fistfight with Greta and her frequent bouts of screaming lacked any sense of genuine feeling. The subtlety that made the set and costume choices so strong was completely absent here; instead, the family was presented as cartoonish and flat.
It is difficult to take one of the most recognizable works of world literature and add something unexpected, but the acrobatic elements and moments of simple beauty in this staging manage to do just that beautifully. Where the production strayed from simplicity, however, it ran into problems. Had it focused more on the minimal, the unadorned, the show would have captured the tragedy of the slow disintegration of the Samsa family and Gregor’s psyche. As it was, the human connections were drowned out by heavy-handed performances, resulting in a production that turned every character into a beast.

A benediction is a cry for divine help. It is an appropriate title for Kent Haruf’s new novel, given that the novel itself seems to cry out for creative inspiration. While it is very technically proficient and occasionally poignant, the author’s inability to avoid lapsing into threadbare clichés ultimately prevents “Benediction” from making a lasting impact.
The relatively slim volume is brimming with folks badly in need of a pick-me-up. The premise of “Benediction” will feel familiar to anyone who has read a Kent Haruf novel. Like all of his works, it is set in Holt, CO, a tiny, fictitious mountain town where everyone knows everyone, and Denver seems a million miles away. The nucleus of “Benediction” is the Lewis house, where general store proprietor Dad Lewis is dying. The imminence of his demise is announced on page one. The novel proceeds to follow the lives of those close to Dad: his wife Mary, his middle-aged daughter Lorraine, his neighbors the Johnson women, his priest Lyle, and Lyle’s son. As Dad circles the proverbial drain, their stories revolve around his own. And while Dad may be the only one among them with a death sentence, each is unmistakably headed for a fall.
The novel is written in third person, but it feels almost disingenuous to imply that the narrator is any sort of person at all: Haruf’s narration is remarkably bare. Truly, this is meant as a compliment. Eschewing poetical frills and abstractions, Haruf’s business is to paint a clear picture of what occurs, and he begins the novel starkly: “When the test came back the nurse called them into the examination room and when the doctor entered the room he just looked at them and asked them to sit down. They could tell by the look on his face where matters stood.” How characters feel about one another is expressed almost exclusively through their actions. Early in the novel, Haruf describes an interaction between Dad and Mary: “She bent forward and kissed him on the head and wrapped her arm around his shoulders and raised up his old age-spotted hand affectionately and held it to her cheek for a long time.” With no needless internal narration, Haruf tells us all we need to know about the nature of their relationship. Through prose in this vein, “Benediction,” at its best, provides a perspective that is simple, but startlingly honest and poignant. The preacher Lyle says to a pair of newlyweds:
“Love is the most important part of life, isn’t it. If you have love you can live in this world in a true way and if you love each other you can see past everything and accept what you don’t understand and forgive what you don’t know or don’t like. Love is all. Love is patient and boundless and right-hearted and long-suffering. I hope you may love each other all your days of life together. And I hope you may have a great many years of those days.”
There’s nothing really novel about this passage; it’s a little corny, for sure. But given Haruf’s no-frills approach to solemn issues of death and estrangement, such scenes are cathartic when he applies his masterful simplicity to what is good in life.
And yet, “Benediction” is the literary equivalent of porridge. It could be considered a staple—not to mention wholesome—but it does not bring anything new to the proverbial table. While “Benediction” tackles complex issues—death, homophobia, romantic failure, the fragility of human relationships—and Haruf handles each of these topics well, he approaches each from an angle that is all too familiar.  When the struggles of Haruf’s characters come to a head, one would be hard-pressed to envision a more hackneyed way for them to do so. The wife confronts the mistress in the supermarket. The feminine high school boy is beat up by jocks in the locker room. And how does his father discover his son’s secret? He walks in on him dressed in his sister’s clothing. These scenes are written with the same level of technical skill that Haruf sustains throughout “Benediction,” but because of their sheer familiarity, such scenes will elicit groans rather than shock. “The woman fell back in her high-heeled shoes and good dress against the stand of oranges.…The woman rushed at Alene and tried now to hit her with her purse, swinging it.” This is nice, clean writing, and the sentiment expressed rings true, but such domestic jealousy and conflict seem trite when not qualified by anything else. The most powerful moment of the novel comes when Haruf turns a stale circumstance on its ear. A character is faced with a horrible and shocking irony—when you read it, you feel your eyes grow wide. If “Benediction” contained a dozen moments like this one, it would be a remarkable book. Unfortunately, this is a brilliant, brutal outlier. Its strength cannot help but throw the triteness of other passages into relief.
Haruf’s superb prose is further undercut by facile dialogue. In Holt and its environs, there appear to be two kinds of people: those who will not admit to feeling anything, and those who are eager to air the most intimate details of their private lives. What’s more, Holtians who are willing to speak their minds all seem to do so in the same fashion. It’s as if, in a bid to save their breath in the high altitude, they have developed a propensity toward clipped, extraordinarily frank sentences. The Johnson women, Willa, and Alene begin to engage in a dialogue about Alene’s lack of a love life:
“‘I had my chance and I lost it,’ [said Alene.]‘What do you mean?’ [said Willa.]‘My chance at love and a life.’ ‘That wasn’t much of a chance, I don’t think.’ ‘It was.’”
Haruf does achieve a sort of balance with this kind of dialogue, in that his spare prose is mimicked in his characters’ speech, but it’s hard to get past the fact that people just do not talk like this. If the dialogue were more believable and the situations less redolent of déja vu, then “Benediction” might be worth the trip out West to Colorado. As it is, “Benediction” is less of a cry and more of a whimper.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was a junior in high school when it started.
Every Saturday morning, I would leave my house in suburban New Jersey and take a train into Manhattan, transfer to the subway, and make my way over to the Manhattan School of Music on the Upper West Side. It was there that I became a musical glutton.
One of the privileges of attending the music school’s pre-college program for high school students is complete access to the music school’s library. For two years, my weekly ritual was a walk down along the long series of stacks to the CD retrieval area, a small room separated by a waist-level divider (not unlike a drive-through without the car). I would hand the library worker—usually a somewhat homely female conservatory student, cruelly nicknamed “The Chub” by my peers—an index card with call numbers for the five CDs I’d be taking home.
It started off small: taking home five CDs and then ripping them to my hard-drive wasn’t too much to handle. I could listen to a record a day and then hand them back next week for a fresh stack of music to consume. But then I discovered box sets: “The Complete [Insert Artist Name Here] on Blue Note [7 Disks],” “Complete [I.A.N.H.] Sessions on Decca [5 Disks],” “The Complete [I.A.N.H.] on Verve [14 (!) Disks],” etc. At the time, I thought of this kind of hoarding behavior as pre-hibernation for the bleak post-pre-college years when I’d be separated from my beloved source of aural stimulation. Once I finished high school, I figured, I’d finally have time to sit down and listen to all of the music I had accumulated.
As it turns out, I now have 21076 items in my iTunes library, i.e., 85 days, 23 hours, 19 minutes, and 54 seconds of sound. To be perfectly honest, I probably haven’t listened to more than a quarter of the songs in my library. What’s worse is that since graduating high school, I’ve discovered an even faster way to acquire large amounts of music: subsuming the libraries of friends via external hard drive, which has added days of music by artists I’d never even heard of (and still don’t recognize, really).
I can’t remember exactly when I realized that I had a problem, but what I can remember is the long series of attempts—mostly failed—to address it: making “Currently Listening” playlists for regimented weekly consumption, trading in my iPod for my CD player (affectionately known as the “oPod”), trading in the CD player for the iPod and going on permanent shuffle, and so forth.
Since coming to college, the problem hasn’t just been that I have too much music that I haven’t listened to—it’s that I still have that problem in addition to having even less time to listen to all the music that I haven’t listened to. It’s sort of a mess, and I don’t even want to mention how Rhapsody and Spotify and YouTube are factoring into the equation.
But there’s hope. In the past, I think the reason for my uncontrollable urge to assimilate everything like an edacious musical blob was because I was worried about missing out; I didn’t want to pass up a chance to get some music that I might not have such easy access to later. Things are different now, mostly because so much music is available for free, any time and all the time. This comes with its own set of problems, most significantly the threat presented to the livelihoods of musicians, but for myself I’ve learned to curb my music-hoarding compulsions—at least a little bit.
When I was younger, I regularly used to read a series of books called “Uncle John’s Bathroom Reader,” which served precisely the purpose its title declaimed. My favorite part was the fortune cookie-length facts, known as “running feet,” one of which would run at the bottom of every page. I remember one such fact—that an adult requires exposure to something seven times before he or she learns to like it (if he or she doesn’t the first time, that is). It’s common sense that the best way to learn to appreciate something unfamiliar is repeated exposure, but I didn’t think to apply this to my musical consumption habits until recently.
Setting my mobile music device on “repeat all” has tempered my need to expand my collection, and I’ve finally found contentment in the middle way of repeated listening. I should be forthcoming about this method, though: what probably helped me even more than adhering to a schedule of repeated listening was actually an accident.
A little while back, all of my music from my mobile device was accidentally disposed of through some technical issues. I chose not to fill up said device as I had before, and the absence of clutter has kept me in check ever since. That said, there is something inherently reassuring about the plenitude of a full mp3 player—never having to worry about not having enough stuff to listen to—but having too much to choose from is distracting more than anything else. There ends up being too much noise.

With the ever-tactless Seth MacFarlane for a host, there was never any doubt that this year’s Academy Awards broadcast would ruffle a fair amount of feathers. For all of its other failings, the ceremony certainly delivered spectacularly on that front; it took a scant few minutes for the “Family Guy” creator to offend just about the entire audience in an opening number cleverly titled “I Saw Your Boobs.” Indeed, I could easily spend the remaining 600 words of this article just listing which lines he crossed, when, and how, but the time lag between my writing this article and its publication means the rest of the Internet will have beaten me to the punch by the time you’re reading this.
But MacFarlane’s particular brand of offensiveness wasn’t the only one on display on Oscar night. In all of the general uproar about the show itself, one could easily overlook the controversial remarks made elsewhere; but once again, the Internet, our one-stop shop for righteous indignation, has us covered. When nine-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis, the Oscar-nominated star of “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” struck a pose upon hearing her name, the satirical newspaper The Onion tweeted, “Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a c***, right?” The uproar—and subsequent apology from The Onion—was nearly immediate, and in the many articles that have sprung up over the past week decrying the poor taste on display at this year’s Academy Awards, this joke is invariably included alongside the bevy of boorish remarks from MacFarlane.While I personally didn’t find The Onion’s tweet particularly funny, it strikes me as somewhat disingenuous to lump it in with the host’s problematic jokes. True, nobody in the broadcast went so far as to legitimately swear, and if they had, they likely would have been censored, as Melissa Leo was when she dropped the f-bomb in her acceptance speech two years ago. No, MacFarlane crossed the line in what I consider a much more egregious fashion.
Consider again the “I Saw Your Boobs” song. Let’s overlook for a moment that just about every Oscars ceremony includes a reference to the Best Actress category’s seemingly unofficial rule of “get naked, get nominated.” Let’s even look beyond the fact that much of the list includes past and present honorees whose breasts were only on display in scenes in which their characters were raped (Jodie Foster in “The Accused,” Hilary Swank in “Boys Don’t Cry,” and Jessica Chastain in “Lawless”). No, it’s the fundamental premise behind the song that makes it so problematic; in a show intended in part to celebrate powerful performances, the first reference to many of the honorees reduced them to nothing more than the object of male lust.
This objectification was in many ways the recurring theme of the night, though it didn’t always manifest as sexism. When it was Salma Hayek’s turn to present, MacFarlane remarked that there’s always at least one foreign presenter each year and that “we have no idea what they’re saying, but we don’t care, ’cause they’re so attractive,” insinuating that foreign actors only matter for their exotic good looks.
Now let’s think about The Onion again, whose intent seems to have been more benign. Though the specific wording was decidedly unfortunate and sexually charged, it’s clear to me that the goal was not to malign Wallis’ femininity. Instead, the joke is that, well, she’s nine years old and adorable, and it’s ridiculous to suggest that anybody could possibly dislike her. In what was undoubtedly a frenzied moment in the fake news room, somebody went too far—way too far—and the joke took on implications it was never supposed to have; replace the c-word with something more mild and the tweet becomes funny again.
As I wrote at length in my last column, I’m not one to overlook poor execution solely on the basis of good intentions—and besides, I see no reason to defend a joke that I found tasteless and unfunny. Still, the distinction between the off-color tweet from The Onion and MacFarlane’s bad jokes is, to me, more than enough to warrant a different response. The former certainly crosses a line, but it does so because somebody wrote it improperly; the latter crossed lines in their very premise, in the fact that somebody thought that casual misogyny and racism were acceptable attitudes with which to approach Hollywood’s biggest celebration. If you’re in the mood for righteous indignation, it’s certainly called for in either instance; but in this case, perhaps not all outrage is created equal.

The February debut of Netflix series “House of Cards” has critics in a frenzy—but not over anything that actually happens on the show. The topic of discussion is instead its method of distribution. The company released all 13 of the series’ episodes on the same day, making it in some ways resemble a long movie more than a traditional television show.
I would like to put on my optimistic hat for a moment and come out in support of the binge release with a dream of what could happen in a future Netflix world. Yes, it’s possible that the shift will move the medium toward film in problematic ways. Unlike traditional networks and premium cable channels, Netflix doesn’t prescribe the number and length of a TV season’s episodes. Critic Jaime Weinman predicts an unavoidable trim down: writers free from restriction will condense what was once a 20-hour season into a three- or four-hour chunk. But while this shift is technically possible, I’d argue it’s far from inevitable. Could the events in the twenty-hour first season of “The West Wing” happen over the course of three? Probably. But would I (and so many others) have fallen in love with Josh Lyman, one of its characters, in just that small amount of time? Probably not.  Likewise, Walter White of “Breaking Bad” wouldn’t so devastate viewers with his moral decay if we’d only known him as an upright citizen for the underside of an hour. Length is an integral part of the television experience. It allows viewers to get to know a world intimately and to gain familiarity with its characters to the point when they feel like real people.
The perks of long-term commitment to a work are familiar to us from outside the realm of visual storytelling; for this reason I turn not to film as a comparative model for television’s future, but instead to the novel. My hope is that future television series will take on the best parts of a great book. They’ll require hours of investment, richly portray worlds, and excel in slowly simmering character explorations. They’ll have complex arcs, interweave subplots, and include details outside of those required for the most economic telling of a story. They’ll proceed in distinct sections released together for a viewer to consume at her own chosen pace. It’s telling that “House of Cards” labels each installment not with traditional titles, but instead just as Chapters 1-13.
In one of the many fascinating pieces of criticism analyzing potential changes to televise, Todd VanDerWerff’s for The A.V. Club, VanDerWerff warns the binge release format could lessen series’ quality. In viewers’ rush to the next installment, they may potentially overlook flaws on the episodic level. But the book model could actually engineer the reverse effect. Much of a novel’s value comes from analysis after a first reading. Readers look back on the product as a whole and notice important ways in which disparate elements connect: a line of dialogue in chapter two takes on a different significance in light of a later development; a collection of imagery suggests a different reading than does the novel’s overt plotline. If producers have control over entire television seasons, they may be able to achieve this same level of artistry. This will in turn encourage a more formal relationship between viewer and product. Television won’t be about casually tuning in for a free hour on Sunday night. It will be about watching, repeating, and savoring. It will be about slow care and analysis.
Netflix has already created an accessible television canon by releasing complete previously aired series. Future viewers will come to new shows with understandings of their historical context and will knowingly appreciate these shows’ innovations. The site is bringing changes, but they won’t end television’s golden age. Rather, they’ll solidify the medium’s place in our culture as a form of serious art.

Ballroom dance is known for for its flashiness, but on Friday, more than just the ballroom dancers’ outfits will be in bright colors. The Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, a competitive ballroom dance team, will perform their annual showcase—this year entitled “Colorful”—in Lowell Lecture Hall.
The team, founded in 1991, comprises Harvard undergraduate and graduate students. It hosts two annual collegiate ballroom competitions and promotes the social aspect of ballroom dancing. While they compete as a team, the dancers typically perform as couples in competitions and shows.While their showcase has been an annual affair, this year’s event will bring a new twist to the annual tradition. According to Ivo B. Baca ’13, the current team captain, this year the team is expanding  their typical solo dance format to add formations with multiple dancers to the showcase.
“All performers have been given the rare opportunity to choreograph their own pieces, and this has really infused the process with a wonderful creative energy,” Baca says. Around 40 dancers will be performing in the show, which will feature six couples, each performing a full piece, from the team’s Rookie and Intermediate classes.
The showcase offers a twist on the standard ballroom and Latin dances, which include the waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, foxtrot, quickstep, cha cha, samba, rumba, jive, and paso doble. To reflect the group’s unique personality, the dances will each be centered around a specific color.
“This showcase is aiming to celebrate the vibrant and colorful nature of the Harvard Ballroom [Dance Team] through the lens of the art we all love—ballroom dance,” Baca says.Tickets are $7 and available at the Harvard Box Office or through members of the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team.

A Mahler enthusiast, Boston Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Benjamin Zander has not conducted one of his favorite works—Mahler’s Symphony No. 2— in 40 years. On Sunday at Symphony Hall,  he will rediscover the piece with the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra. The Harvard University Choirs, featuring solo vocalists Barbara Quintiliani and Robynne Redmon and conducted by University choirmaster Edward E. Jones, will accompany the BPYO to perform the masterpiece.
The orchestra will also perform Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A minor with 17-year-old teenage piano phenomenon George Li, whose talent Zander compares to that of internationally renowned Chinese pianist Lang Lang. Sunday afternoon’s concert will boast 140 singers and 128 musicians in total, all of whom have worked hard on the Mahler since November. “This will inevitably be one of the greatest sounds known to man,” Zander says.
Also known as the Resurrection Symphony, Mahler’s 2nd is composed of five movements. The first consists of a “heaven-storming” funeral march, which, according to the BPYO website, is full of grief, protest, and wild emotion. The fourth, titled “Urlicht” (German for “Primeval Light”), will be sung by mezzo-soprano Redmon. It marks the turning point from death to resurrection in the symphony, as its hero prays that God will guide him to the Eternal Light. The final movement is Mahler’s interpretation of the “Day of Judgment.” “The piece makes [the audience] inspired and crazy,” Zander says. “No one can resist it.”
According to the conductor, Mahler himself was taken aback by his own work, even though he created the piece. “This is the most powerful expression of optimism of any piece of music, and its only competitor is Beethoven’s 9th,” Zander says.The orchestra, made up of students aged 12 to 21, began preparing the Mahler back in November.
“I can’t imagine when I was that age. I am lucky to have an orchestra that can play with this kind of conviction,” Zander says. The BPYO has plans to embark on a six-city summer tour in the Netherlands to present the entirety of its first season on a world stage.  “This will be a real high point for this next generation, and for me as well,” Zander says. “This is one performance that is not to be missed.”

Poetry is prized for its unique power to wander the interstices between nature and memory and to synthesize inspiration from many sources. In this spirit, seven poets will be at Harvard on Friday to present their works from “The Arcadia Project: North American Postmodern Pastoral,” a 2012 literary anthology consisting exclusively of post-1995 American poetry.
The nearly 600-page collection features formally innovative work in the tradition of the pastoral,  an ancient form of lyric poetry celebrating shepherds and rural life. At the same time, these poems address ideas from an ecological perspective—a style sometimes called ecopoetry—maintaining a consciousness of one’s ecological citizenship and relation to the environment today.
The readings will take place in the Edison-Newman Room of Houghton Library and will be co-sponsored by the book’s publisher, Ahsahta Press, and the Woodberry Poetry Room. Poets confirmed for the event include Dan Beachy-Quick, John Beer, Timothy Donnelly, Gabriel Gudding, Dana Levin, Brian Teare, C.D. Wright,  Joshua Corey, and G.C. Waldrep. Corey and Waldrep, who are the editors of the anthology, will also be introducing the event.
Though the poets hail from across the United States and use widely differing aesthetic approaches, they are united in their conjuring of Arcadia, an ancient Greek city. The event’s speakers represent a diversity of influences and styles. Beer, whose works have been compared to those of John Ashbery, is the recipient of the  Norma Farber First Book Award from the Poetry Society of America. Donnelly is a poet and assistant professor of creative writing at Columbia University whose style is sprawling, subtle, and enigmatic. Waldrep is a poet and historian who teaches at Bucknell University and is the editor-at-large of the Kenyon Review. Corey is the Gustav E. Beerly, Jr. assistant professor of English at Lake Forest College. Together they create an ecologically focused view of an ancient city.

"This picture often leads women to exclaim, 'Give me a kitchen like that!'" boomed Australian voice artist Bob Kuhn to a crowd wearing 3D glasses and intently gazing at the stereoscopic slide projection before them in the Carpenter Center’s Main Gallery. The image was of the futuristic, all-white kitchen in architect Walter Gropius's house in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and it was only one of the 20-or-so 3D images of Gropius House that the audience was fortunate enough to be able to view that evening.
During archival research for their Carpenter Center exhibition “Brute,” which is on view through April 7, artists and visual and environmental studies faculty members Katarina Burin and Amie Siegel found a mysterious box containing these stereoscopic slides and accompanying captions and decided to bring them back to life as a slide presentation. As the legacy of architect Le Corbusier and the history of Carpenter Center came under the spotlight with "Brute," which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Carpenter Center, so in this event did the other great names associated with the building—among them Gropius, a founder of the Bauhaus School of architecture.
To contextualize the photographs, VES professor Laura Frahm gave a mini-talk before the slide performance. The talk explored the web connecting the building, Gropius, visual arts education at Harvard, the Bauhaus ideals, and another exhibition put on in the Carpenter Center more than 45 years ago: "Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea."
According to Frahm, the ’50s were a key moment for the visual arts' rise to prominence at Harvard. Through the 1956 Brown report, the Committee on the Visual Arts proposed a $6.5 million expansion in the visual arts program. The Committee wrote in a 1956 Crimson article, “Perhaps at no moment in history since the invention of printing has man's communication with his fellow man been so largely taken over by visual media as today.” The Committee was successful, and the Carpenter Center, the only Le Corbusier building in North America, was erected in 1963.
A couple of years later, in 1966, as work was underway to revamp the visual arts curriculum at Harvard, architectural historian Eduard F. Sekler organized the exhibition "Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea.” Through this exhibition, Sekler also articulated his Bauhaus-inspired academic agenda for the Visual and Environmental Studies Department, which he co-founded with Albert Szabo in 1968.
Frahm described this agenda of Bauhaus ideals as a vision for total life, which necessitated a new building to provoke new ways of thinking and creating. Concerned with the question of how one can best develop as a human being, the Bauhaus teaching idea did not distinguish between art and life and made the architecture of the learning space an integral part of the creative process. The innovative simplicity of the 3D photographs of Gropius House reflects precisely this Bauhaus grounding of an art of living in the functional form. Each of the photographs' captions gives not just the date, but also the time of day when the photograph was taken, down to the minute, reflecting the same predilection for precision shown in a quote by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe that Frahm cited. "The Bauhaus was not an institution with a clear program––it was an idea, and Gropius formulated this idea with great precision,” Van der Rohe said in a speech for Gropius’s 80th birthday. “The fact that it was an idea, I think, is the cause of enormous influence the Bauhaus has had on any progressive school on the globe."
Continually devoted to new ideas and inspirations, as exemplified by "Brute,” the Carpenter Center still carries the focus of Bauhaus that Sekler articulated in the catalogue of "Bauhaus––A Teaching Idea,” quoted by Frahm in her talk. “It is not a question of imitation but of tradition, in the best sense of that word, when it is meant to include continuous reassessment, growth, and change,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the opening scene of “Holy Motors,” Leos Carax’s most recent feature  film after a 13-year hiatus, the audience is confronted with the image  of the director himself: Carax wakes up in his pajamas in a room next to  his dog peacefully dozing on the bed. As he tours the room with the  slow and cautious steps of an apprehensive explorer charting new  territories, he stops in front of a wall. He begins to feel around the  wallpaper in the dark. He finds the hole he is looking for, plugs in his  right middle finger, which is nothing more than a metal apparatus with a  cylindrical end, and pushes with all his might to force open the hidden  portal, which opens to a theater in which his film is playing.
 
 Carax made a similarly surprising appearance—albeit after  two of his films, and with neither pajamas nor the metal middle  finger—at the Carpenter Center Lecture Hall for the Harvard Film  Archive’s Carax retrospective “Overdrive,” which took place during the  last two weekends of February. Carax is notoriously averse to public  appearances and speaking with press about his work, so it was a rare  privilege to hear the director speak in depth about his work.
 
 When asked about this peculiar prelude to “Holy Motors,”  Carax candidly replied that after such a long pause, he simply had to  assert his presence, confirm on film that he is still alive. This is not  to say, he continued, that “Holy Motors” is a film about cinema. In  fact, Carax stressed that he has a more important topic on his agenda  that fuels his creative endeavors. In line with his definition of cinema  as “the human body in action,” as he said at the HFA, Carax’s oeuvre  seeks to restore the power cinema once had in the time of the Lumière  Brothers and Georges Méliès—when a large, bulky machine’s projection of  a train arriving at a station was a captivating spectacle for audiences  unfamiliar to this visual attraction. Taking after Étienne-Jules Marey,  who dissected the corporeal motion—running of a naked man, the  galloping of a horse, the pole-jumping of an athlete, second by through  the use of his “chrono-photography,” Carax aspires to revive the  fascination with the human body and motion by putting them under a new  light.
 
 Perhaps the word he used most often during his brief  presence at the Carpenter Center to describe his recent work is  “reinvent.”  Beginning with one of his earliest feature films, “Mauvais Sang” (“Bad  Blood”), Carax showed his debt to both the French New Wave and the  precious era of the silent cinema through segments that are,in the words  of Harvard Film Archive Director Haden Guest, who also spoke at the  event, “theatrically simple [and] richly cinematic”—the magic tricks the  male lead Alex plays throughout the film, for instance. Carax’s thirst  for invention appears under the guise of the indeterminacy of  genre—“Mauvais Sang” mixes the angst of a coming-of-age story with the  leftovers of a gangster movie, adding a healthy dose of science fiction  with the plague of an imaginary sexually-transmitted disease.
 
 In “Les Amants du Pont-Neuf” (“The Lovers on the Bridge”),  the reinvention of space is what is at stake. Carax constructs a replica  of the Pont Neuf—a bridge thousands of Parisians and tourists tread  everyday—in the suburbs of Paris, only to close it for renovation, so  that it becomes home to a homeless trio. On the other hand, “Pola X,”  Carax’s following feature, is based on Herman Melville’s “Pierre: or,  the Ambiguities” and follows a young heir’s discovery of his self-avowed  life’s purpose: leaving his luxurious life in the countryside to look  after his long-lost half-sister, Isabelle, who has been living on the  streets. The first couple of unusually bright and uplifting (and  deliberately pretentious) scenes, which feature a country château, golf,  and horseback riding, quickly gives way to dark cityscapes of Paris’s  immigrant and industrial neighborhoods. Pierre, already famous as a  writer under the pseudonym “Aladdin,” attempts unsuccessfully to give a  new direction to his writing career in strange, unfamiliar, and often  trying environments.
 
 Likewise, reinvention is at the heart of “Holy Motors,”  Carax’s 2012 hit, which was nominated for the prestigious Palme d’Or of  the Cannes Film Festival. A “performer,” Oscar (Denis Lavant)—whose name  is a combination of the last syllable of “Leos” and the first of  “Carax”—shuttles between different lives in a white limousine, rushing  from “appointment” to “appointment.” In this limousine fully equipped  with an actor’s makeup mirror, Oscar can transform himself into anyone,  including an Eastern European beggar woman, a motion-capture actor, a  red-haired outcast by the name of “Merde” (French for “shit”) who eats  nothing but flowers and cash, or a dying benevolent patriarch whose  niece owes him much of her prosperity. In between these episodes of  “performance,” there are fairly short but poignant scenes of preparation  (scrambling for props, donning wigs, putting on makeup) for these  roles in transit, which lay bare the artifice of acting in particular.
 
 There are very few episodes when Oscar is simply himself  outside the boundaries of the limousine. In one of those rare moments,  Lavant shares a scene with Kylie Minogue, starring in the role of  another white limousine-driven “performer,” Jean, who used to be  together with Oscar 20 years ago. They mount the elegant Art Deco stairs  of the now-deserted La Samaritaine, a department store undergoing  reconstruction to reopen as a luxury hotel, while Minogue mournfully  sings, “Who are we? / Who were we / when we were / who we were back  then?” The overwhelmingly beautiful high and low angles of the ascent  are accompanied by the presence of mannequins’ body parts inside La  Samaritaine, as if to dramatically emphasize the fictional  fragmentations of the couple in their personal and professional lives.  “Holy Motors” is thus also a hesitant prodding of the darker side of  reinvention—namely, the impossibility of retaining one’s past after  cycles of re-identification.
 
 If we are to go by Carax’s maxim as stated at the  retrospective, that “we have to reinvent ourselves at some point; if we  don’t, we stop living,” Carax’s work may be a cinema of the reinvention  of the self, space, and medium, but its strength is primarily rooted in  its ability to demonstrate that this process is anything but  straightforward, explicable, or even vaguely graspable. No wonder when  the man with the winemark (Michel Piccoli) asks Carax’s alter-ego Oscar  in what keeps him going, the answer is just an enigmatic “la beauté du  geste” (“the beauty of the act”), but more specifically the beauty of  gesturing, mimicking, moving—or simply, being.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My concentration is apparently the most satisfying one at Harvard: Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality is known for its small class sizes, excellent advising, and wonderful community. Even so, I used to feel nervous walking into the WGS office to meet a professor—until I learned that WGS’s program coordinator would always warmly greet me. This semester, each time she walks out of her office to talk to me about my coursework or my life, thte WGS coordinator updates the sign on her office door with a new sticky note: “245 days without a contract!”
Like 4,600 other members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, the WGS coordinator has been working without a wage raise since June 2011. Sadly, Harvard's ongoing negotiations with its clerical workers demonstrate a fundamental lack of respect for the people who make Harvard run. Whether negotiations focused on health care, size of the bargaining unit, or wages, Harvard has sent the signal that respecting workers' time and lives is not a top priority for our university.
Harvard administrators have repeatedly made public statements asserting the fairness of their wage offers. For example, Harvard has noted that “compensation is on average at the 75th percentile.” (Harvard has not cited any sources for this number—and the average worker’s wages were predicted to rise 3 percent last year, making Harvard’s wage raise offer below average.) Harvard Director of Labor Relations Bill Murphy argued that “Our benefits still rank in the top 25 percent, so we think it’s a fair and reasonable offer.” These numbers raise important questions: Does this pool of compensations include all clerical workers, or just those at academic institutions? Does it include only unionized workers, or also workers without union representation? And most importantly, when does Harvard ever think it reasonable just to be in the top 25 percent?
It’s hard to paint a clear picture of the HUCTW negotiations with statistics. The Crimson argued last week that “With an average salary of $50,000 as of 2011 and wage increases consistently beating local inflation, HUCTW workers are paid well above competitive market rates.” This average salary does not include the dozens (if not hundreds) of temporary and casual workers who are not members of the HUCTW bargaining unit but probably should be. Just as importantly, the thousands of workers making below $50,000 per year must be struggling to keep up with Cambridge’s high cost of living, including skyrocketing rents and food prices, let alone supporting their families.
Behind these statistics, dozens of comments on The Crimson’s site point to the difficult reality of many workers’ lives at Harvard. In response to an anonymous comment that “It'd be interesting to see how many Harvard staff have second jobs to help make ends meet,” multiple HUCTW members replied saying that they have not one, but two extra jobs on top of their jobs at Harvard. Other workers wrote about working extra hours of uncompensated time to make up for the work lost by Harvard’s 2009 and 2012 staff cuts. “A Harvard Worker” noted, “We've all been working a lot harder these past few years in the wake of mass layoffs and voluntary retirements. Many of us are now doing jobs that were previously done by two people. Yet our compensation certainly has not doubled over that period.”
It is because of the WGS coordinator and other workers I interact with on a daily basis that I attended HUCTW’s 750-person rally in Memorial Church last week. The dozens of students at the rally demonstrated that students—apparently unlike the University administration—value and respect HUCTW workers.
As I have learned from giving tours for the Admissions Office, Harvard has the largest academic library in the world. The Harvard Library boasts over 16 million volumes, 8 million photographs, and extensive archival material ranging from recordings to maps to letters. Tour guides tell prospective students that researchers and academics come from across the country and globe just to use Harvard’s unparalleled academic resources.
Yet all of these books are worth nothing if Harvard’s libraries are not navigable, or if there is no one to process, catalogue, and preserve archives. Indeed, the workers at Harvard library are also some of the most experienced, knowledgeable, and dedicated library staff around. If Harvard hopes to attract and retain workers who can maintain Harvard Library’s top status, it cannot simply expect its workers to accept higher co-pays and lower wage raises. Harvard doesn't help its image or its library by arguing that it can skimp on workers' wages.
The WGS coordinator carried a sign at the rally noting the hypocrisy of Harvard’s negotiating position. It read: “POP QUIZ: For which of the follow does Harvard think a 75th percentile ranking is sufficient? A) Applicant SAT scores. B) Applicant GPAs. C) Full professor salaries. D) HUCTW salaries.” Harvard is not used to settling for 75th percentile. For better or for worse, HUCTW showed a lot of respect for Harvard when it agreed that workers would take a lower wage increase during the recession to offset the hit Harvard took in the financial crisis. Harvard should show its workers the same respect—and stop arguing that the 75th percentile is acceptable for clerical workers.

Last week, in a victory for the causes of public safety and human sanity, the United States federal government ordered the Fung Wah bus service to cease all operations. The Fung Wah service was one in a fleet of several functionally unsound “Chinatown” lines that perilously escort passengers from Boston to Manhattan. Despite the plethora of automobile accidents instigated by derelict Fung Wah drivers in the line’s 17-year history, the bargain of a price unfortunately attracted more than a few Harvard students looking for an economical route back to New York City. The faults identified by the U.S. government demonstrate how each passenger aboard the Fung Wah bus put his or her life in jeopardy. Those structural problems authenticate pleas for an extensive and cost-effective train system throughout the nation.
It is truly a shame that so many Harvard students are compelled to take their chances with the shoddy engineering of cheap buses rather than ride in the relative luxury afforded by the Amtrak line. The rationalization is not a complex one: While the astute shopper can purchase a standby bus ticket for as low as $1, train tickets are liable to cost around upwards of $100. Amtrak’s amenities explain this variance in price—passengers are privy to clean bathrooms, WiFi, café cars, and the guarantee of a safe trip home. In addition, trains are rather comfortable and enjoyable to ride, with expansive legroom and nonexistent wait times that place them in direct contrast to the commoditization of the altogether harrying airplane experience.
America’s peregrinators are finally recognizing the halcyon alternative to disagreeable and sometimes dangerous travel adventures. A recent study by the Brookings Institution shows that Amtrak’s passenger count has ballooned from 20.1 million to 31.2 million in the past 15 years. This demonstrative shift in demand was initially met by Obama administration plans for an illustrious national high-speed rail system. Unfortunately, the substandard shape of American finances put the kibosh on this program, and the recent realization of the feared sequester lends little hope to future earmarking for novel spending regimes.
This is a shame, as a revamped rail service would reap benefits sure to ripple throughout the economy. It would also increase public safety by luring travelers away from more precarious automobile transportation. While buses may have their place delivering children to school and ferrying tourists around a city, there are few compelling arguments to why they should be relied upon for long distance transportation. At the moment, trains serve as the perfect surrogate. But a rise in demand must be met with a commensurate rise in supply. We hope America’s policymakers understand this basic point of introductory economics and bolster support for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, otherwise known as Amtrak.

I’ve found it’s best in life not to have any friends.
They take up a lot of time, space, and energy, all of which could be put to more productive ends by doing schoolwork, participating in extracurricular activities, or joining social clubs—which has nothing to do with friends, of course. While it is a little difficult at times not to make any friends, I’ve somehow succeeded in keeping my college friend-count shockingly low. Some say that’s a reflection on me, but I would never be narcissistic enough to say such a thing. And my efforts are finally paying off: The deadline to submit blocking groups is on Wednesday. Right about now, across the Yard, it’s the hell week for friendship. Take my not-so-friendly advice: Blocking, as well as life in general, shouldn’t be made about friends.
For those who may not know, blocking is the process by which freshmen decide with whom among their friends they will live (up to eight people in each group) for the next three years. Except I shouldn’t say “friends” because often you aren’t even close with four or five of your blockmates, who are there just because they know your friend, whose friendship you are now considering ending because he or she brought these weirdoes (or “block-headed-mates”) in to live with you. Except I shouldn’t say “live” because you don’t even really end up living with all of them as a sophomore. Except I shouldn’t say “sophomore” because you drop out of school during freshman spring because the drama of blocking has ruined everything.
By placing an arbitrary yet rigidly defined structure on the “Does he like me?…what a back stabbing… we bro so hard… pssht, that can’t be me in that strange, and what seems like intoxicated, voicemail…” unstructured world of social circles, the blocking process pressures groups of friends into defining their relationships in ways better left undefined. Unless you happen to have seven friends who all love one another and can’t stand anyone else on campus, the result is usually awkward conversations, pain, and betrayal. The friends that were once your support groups become the problems in your life that you need support to face. And the friends that were once the people who you defended, you feel you may have abandoned.
The worst part of it is, there’s no clear way to fix the problem. There’s got to be some institution by which people have the option to stick together. And without a defined number like eight people (no matter what that number is), organizing housing would be impossible. But, although there might not be a way to fix the problem directly, there is a clear-cut way to avoid it: don’t involve friends.
If you do involve friends, you end up losing them anyway or at least somewhat altering your relationship with them in a negative way. But when you are friendless, you end up becoming the most friendly and happy person on campus, because you don’t have to go through the degrading blocking process. So there’s no reason to have any friends. In my own interest, I’ll make something clear now: If you still consider yourself a friend of mine, from now on just know that you’re not. If you consider yourself an enemy of mine, remember that I am one of the most friendly people left in the freshman class, so it’s impossible for you to be my enemy anymore—but you’re not a friend of mine either. And if you consider yourself a frenemy of mine, grow up and get yourself a vocabulary.
But if you for some reason want to have friends (and I can’t see why), you can still follow a similar route. While it is easier for someone like me not to get involved in blocking schematics, it might be hard for someone who’d prefer to live with people they know, people with whom they have similar schedules, or just people who have nice furniture. At the end of the (Housing) day, your blockmates are just the people you are kinda living with, but not really. You can choose to be friends with them, or you can choose not to be, or you can just choose to float. At most, the people you live with (kind of, but not really) should be just one social circle among various other, undefined ones. It is inappropriate for students to make blocking a process by which they make, break, or define their best friendships—it’s only real function is to define, but not really, living situations. Structuring one’s social life based on administrative housing protocol is just a mistake.
So, between the inevitable backroom meetings and long nights of worry, just try to remember the appropriately paradoxical slogan “friends don’t let friends block together.” Whether you end up floating, blocking, dropping, or whatever else next semester, as long as you don’t make the process purely about friendship, you’ll always have a friend two, or more, only a few blocks away.
But then there’s the Quad…

Can you imagine being there on the night of that first performance? The atmosphere? The build-up? The payoff! When for the first time—the first time in the history of the world—that music is being played, that artist’s vision being expressed. I’m not talking about the debut of today’s virtuosos Tiesto or Skrillex, either. No, I’m referring to the first performances from the likes of Mozart, or Beethoven, or Rachmaninoff. Maybe not technically the first times they performed, but the first times they truly performed to potential, the first times their audiences recognized them as greats.
I’m referring to classical rock stars, not modern ones—people of musical talent who were revered during their times just as our current icons are today. But the fact that similar language can describe the opening nights for either of these, for yesterday’s classical or today’s electronic, is very telling. Indeed, it only supports a wider truth I have come to know over the last few months: Electronic dance music is the new classical.
As ludicrous as this proposition may seem at first, give it a chance. It might grow on you. For example, have you taken into account the fact that, from a purely technical standpoint, both these genres engage their audiences with equally huge varieties of sounds? Rock and roll has its electric guitar, rap its thumping bass. But classical has its orchestra, and EDM its synthesizer, both of which represent a much wider collection of instruments and sounds. The only real difference is that while classical music requires a live orchestra, electronic music requires only its synthetic counterpart. Think of the synthesizer—the primary tool of EDM musicians—then, as a sort of modernized orchestra, a collection of digitized instruments and their distortions.
But the parallels existing between electronic and classical go even further than their varied selection of sounds. Both also stand, for instance, as arguably the most diverse groupings of music. They are less like individual genres and more like umbrellas, encompassing many sub-genres underneath. This comparison can be taken a step further when one realizes that many of the sub-genres of EDM directly reflect those of classical.
At an artist-specific level, this isn’t too hard to see. Take Skrillex: With his chaotic and unpredictable melodies, he’s like a dubstep version of Stravinsky—stunning, offending, but then ultimately winning over his audiences. But Deadmau5, with his minimal melodies and patience-testing (but worth-the-wait) buildups, reflects the repetitious yet emotionally moving style of composers like Philip Glass or Frédéric Chopin.
In a more general sense, both these genres tend to rely on melodies that are repeated and overlaid onto each other, building up the fullness and intensity of sound as the work progresses, until finally resolving it all in harmony. So while the characteristic, in-your-face “drop” of an electronic song might be lacking in classical pieces, its underlying concept remains.
Beyond their actual composition, the role these genres play(ed) in their respective cultures is also surprisingly similar. Young people today might see classical works as out of touch or stale, but when those works were first being composed (and performed), nothing could have been further from the truth. Just as today the fans of EDM stars live for the next performance, the fans of classical composers once lived for their next performances. And just as modern EDM figures continually push the boundaries of what we consider musically appropriate, so too did classical composers push the musical boundaries of their respective eras. Through the genres’ best artists, culture has been shifted—forced forward—by classical and electronic music in much the same way.
In the end, realizing the parallels that can be drawn between classical and EDM should only lead to a deeper appreciation of both. Here we have what at first seem to represent opposite ends of the musical spectrum: the wild and young electronic versus the stuffy and refined classical. Yet once this oversimplified and quite inaccurate differentiation is put aside, the connections between both musical forms become apparent. While the outward styles of music might have changed significantly over time—I doubt many senior citizens enjoy Skrillex—the core remains in many ways the same.
So the next time you find yourself fist-pumping and head-bobbing to an electronica bass line, take a step back and realize that the catchy synth melody accompanying it isn’t all that different from those classical melodies of yore.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As edX approaches its one-year anniversary, the rapidly growing online venture is looking to become economically self-sufficient, said edX President Anant Agarwal at a virtual education conference on Monday.
Hosted by Harvard and MIT, the  Online Learning and the Future of Residential Education Summit gathered roughly 200 academic and institutional leaders in higher education, technology, and government to discuss blending virtual and on-campus learning. Moderated panels also facilitated dialogue on the institutional barriers to online education.
Launched with $30 million investments from both Harvard and MIT last May, edX is a non-profit online educational platform whose X Consortium has expanded to include twelve institutional partners from all over the world—each of which is required to commit both funds and online courses to the initiative.
Agarwal said that revisions to edX’s revenue strategy will look to supplement this institutional support, so that edX can remain a non-profit endeavor without becoming a financial burden on its partners. Future revenue models might fill the gap between investment and income by charging users for special services such as in-person professor contact, certificates, or executive education programs.
“As edX, we have very lofty goals, but at the heart of it, we’re building a business,” Agarwal said. “We don’t have to turn in huge profits like Facebook’s $100 billion IPO, but we have to be self-sustaining.
MIT President L. Rafael Reif said that after MIT launched OpenCourseWare—a publicly available, web-based collection of nearly all MIT course content—ten years ago, it quickly learned that donor-based support was not a viable model for financing a nonprofit in the long-term.
He added that edX will need to find more funding beyond the seed grants invested last year—and suggested that some of this revenue might come from future university capital campaigns.
“Inasmuch [as] Harvard and MIT committed the money, now we have to find the money,” he said. “We have to raise it and we’re spending it, and hopefully a campaign will help us raise whatever we need.”
Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 referenced two financial responsibilities held by the University with respect to HarvardX—its initial commitment of $30 million and the cost required to prepare each new course­—as evidence that additional revenue generation will be critical. He noted that alumni have already expressed tremendous support for the initiative.
“We certainly are going to be seeking philanthropic support,” Garber said. “But we also believe that this is in our future, and anything that’s in our future, that’s a long-term project [that] needs to be self-sustaining.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A campus debate has flared up over mock eviction notices posted on students’ doors as part of a postering campaign organized by the Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee.
The flyers, which were distributed Sunday in some of Harvard’s freshman and upperclassman dorms, informed students that their rooms were “scheduled for demolition in the next three days.” The notices went on to liken the mock eviction campaign to what they say is a unlawful displacement of Palestinians from their homeland at the hands of the Israeli government. The notices were part of efforts to publicize the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week, which includes a film screening, a lecture by Noam Chomsky, and the construction of what they call an “apartheid wall” in the Science Center Plaza meant to resemble the hotly contested Israeli West Bank barrier currently being built along the West Bank by the Israeli government.
According to organizer Yacoub H. Kureh ’13, the PSC distributed mock flyers on campus at least once before, in November 2010. Though the publicity campaign generated few waves in the past, this time the mock eviction notices have been received with more resistance.
After distributing mock eviction notices throughout Quincy House, Kureh expressed dismay in a Sunday night email sent over the House list that his notices had been ripped up and thrown on the ground.
And early Monday morning, one Eliot student voiced frustration in a separate email sent out over his House list when he received a mock eviction notice on his bedroom door, rather than on the door of his suite—a placement that organizers say was unintentional. Several other students in Eliot responded to the email largely voicing opposition to the publicity campaign and the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week.
Steven J. Tricanowicz ’13, one of the Eliot residents who responded to the House email thread, said in an interview that he believes that the PSC “did a very bad job” of promoting constructive debate.
“I feel like [Israeli Apartheid Week] goes against what Harvard stands for as a place for open academic dialogue, open thoughts, and open intellectual activity,” said Tricanowicz. “I find it kind of concerning that an event is going on in a way that promotes polarization and closed-mindedness.”
Alexander R. Shams, a student at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and a member of the PSC, said organizers expected to receive mixed reactions to the campaign.
“We weren’t too worried [about offending people] because the kind of events we’re hosting are the reality in Palestine,” Shams said. “If you’re going to be offended by it, be offended by the policies, not paper notices we use for advertising.”
Though the flyers provoked ire from some, other students defended the PSC’s right to publicize its events.
Kureh’s email over the Quincy House list prompted words of support from his fellow Quincy residents.
Kureh said he was “pleased with the response.”
Still, Sara Kantor ’14, co-chair of Harvard Students for Israel, said she believes the Harvard Israeli Apartheid Week is “inherently problematic.” According to its website, Harvard Students for Israel “is founded on a belief in the Jewish nation’s right to exist as a sovereign power in its historic homeland.”
“We feel bad responding to something that is so outside the spectrum of what we are willing to engage in,” said Kantor, who is a Crimson Arts editor and a former president of Harvard Hillel. “The issue is that it no longer becomes a question of dialogue—it simply becomes rhetoric and demonizes an entire nation and people.”
But Kureh said that amid the charged politics surrounding the issues, his group is focused on remedying what it perceives to be forced segregation of Palestinians.
“This is a humanitarian crisis,” Kureh said. “We’re going to stay with that.”

Allison Macfarlane, chairman of the Nuclear Regulator Commission, argued that NRC oversight of U.S. nuclear technology is important for ensuring the adequate protection of public health and safety.
“As the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we don’t prognosticate or predict the future of nuclear energy or have a stake in it,” Macfarlane said. “We don’t promote nuclear energy; we simply oversee the existing facilities.”
Macfarlane provided examples of recent nuclear disasters, such as the Fukushima plant, to argue for the importance of adequate preparation in dealing with potentially dangerous nuclear materials. She said that one of the most important elements of regulating nuclear reactors is to make sure the reactors have a constant supply of electrical energy in order to power their air conditioning systems and avoid meltdown.
In the case of Fukushima, Macfarlane said that the earthquake, which was one of the largest in history and caused excessive flooding, prevented back up generators from being able to power the core cooling systems.
“Nuclear regulation is something we can’t ever get lax about. We have to continually be on the ball, making sure that our licensees are acting safely and securely,” she said. “We need to make sure that we are up to date with our information.”
Macfarlane also said that, in light of both natural disasters and terrorist threats, the NRC has increased evaluations of protection from excessive inundation, seismic activity, and nuclear sabotage.
The lecture was the first of a series hosted by the Future of Energy initiative at Harvard, which seeks to unify members of the Harvard community to create a dialogue about energy related issues.
Manoj Easaw, a student at the Harvard School of Public Health who attended the talk, said he came to hear Macfarlane’s  “thoughts on putting our resources in an energy source we don’t know the long term outcomes of.”
Easaw added that the use of a resource with a large potential for danger troubles him.
But other attendees said that they believe the benefits of nuclear energy outweigh the risks.
“It’s an efficient fuel and you better get used to it,” said A. Egon Cholakian, a graduate of Harvard Law School who was also in attendance.

Amahl Bishara, an assistant professor of anthropology at Tufts, challenged traditional ideas of objectivity in American media on Monday during a discussion of her new book, “Back Stories: U.S. News Production and Palestinian Politics."
The event—one in a series of speakers hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative—discussed the role Palestinian journalists play in U.S. news, and the effect of American media on Palestinian politics.
Bishara said her book provides an ethnographic approach to journalism in Palestine, and looks specifically at journalists’ experiences during Israeli invasions, attitudes towards journalists, the process of producing news, and the reasons journalists in the region pursue their work.
She said her book also examines American media’s dependence on and interpretation of Palestinian reporting, scrutinzing the concept of the “neutral American” reporter. Bishara said that American media often depends on reporting on the ground by Palestinian reporters, a relationship she illustrated by tracing a quote that first appeared in Palestinian news outlets before being used in the American press.
Bishara also said that because American and international reporters lack the institutional knowledge that Palestinian reporters have, they struggle to accurately report on the on-going conflict. She discussed issues with the media’s current attempts to appear fair by using “balanced objectivity.”
“I want to challenge the idea of objective news,” she said. “It always comes from a frame.”
Bishara emphasized that the points of focus within news articles—and the structure of news articles themselves—create a subjective lense through which the reader then sees Palestine.
For example, by presenting the Palestinian conflict through interviews with different groups involved, Bishara said international reporting suggests a sense of communication between the groups that does not actually exist.
Bishara also presented clips from her documentary “Across Oceans, Among Colleagues”, which she said was one of the first ethnographies of the Second Intifada, a period of intense Israeli-Palestinian violence between 2000 and 2005. The clips showed the experiences of award-winning Palestinian cameraman Mazen Dana, who was killed while reporting in Iraq in 2003. She said Palestinian journalists like Dana currently experience attacks on their professionalism and objectivity through both physical violence and legal obstacles.
Jeffrey P. Bieley, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he found Bishara’s talk both relevant and insightful.
“It was interesting to hear about the limitations of journalism and the expectations of objectivity placed on journalism,” Bieley said.

James J. “Jimmy” Watts ’10 died in an avalanche while ice climbing on Mount Washington in New Hampshire on Friday. He was 24.
During his time at Harvard, Watts lived in Eliot House and concentrated in molecular and cellular biology. He was also an avid climber and a dedicated member of the Harvard Mountaineering Club.
“Jimmy was such a true leader, mentor, and friend to so many of us in the club,” Mountaineering Club president Nick B. Waldo ’13 wrote in a email to the Crimson. “It is hard to imagine what the current Harvard Mountaineering Club would look like without him. We will always remember him for his caring for others, his quick laugh, and his unfailingly positive attitude.”
Watts was in Huntington’s Ravine on Mount Washington when the avalanche was triggered, pushing him 1,000 feet down the ravine, according to the Forest Service.
Another hiker found him around 3 p.m. Friday. Authorities believe Watts was alone when he died.
Watts, an Idaho native, was pursuing a medical degree at Columbia University’s medical school, and was due to graduate in 2016.
His Facebook page says he worked at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
As of press time, neither Watts’s family nor members of the residential staff of Eliot House who knew Watts could be reached.
Check The Crimson for a forthcoming obituary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the way back from a tough road trip at Princeton and Penn, the Harvard men’s basketball beat writers convened to discuss the events of the weekend. Below are the highlights from the exclusive taped conversation made available to The Back Page. 
 
On freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and pick-and-rolls…
 
David Freed: “Has Siyani Chambers been figured out by the Ivy League?”
Catherine E. Coppinger: “I don’t know if that’s true. Penn definitely figured out how to contain him.”
DF: “He doesn’t shoot from outside and he’s not getting into the lane. He’s 3-14 in his last five games.”
Hope Schwartz: “That’s crazy because he started out as one of the strongest three-point shooters on the team.”
DF: “It helps that nobody sets screens for him on pick-and-rolls. Steve’s screen is basically a show-and-roll to them.”
 
On the way the Quakers played:
 
Martin Kessler: “I was just impressed by Penn and a lot of people will look at the game and say that Harvard lost because they were considered to be favorite but I feel like Penn won that game the way they played.”
HS: “You can’t say enough about their defense this weekend. Harvard was shooting twenty percent for most of the first half. It was ridiculous and going one for ten from three, whatever it was, that was great.”
MK: “Penn is going to be very good in years to come. The Hicks-Chambers matchup will be a good one to watch going forward.”
 
On the final shot against Penn…
 
MK: “Although that last play, it was really well executed. Relatively, Webby had a fairly open look.”
CEC: “That was a lot better than the look they got two nights ago against Princeton.”
HS: “If he’d had a second or two more, I think he probably could have had an open look. He was pretty open”.”
DF: “Definitely feel like it should have been Rivard taking that last shot though.”
MK: “It was weird that all those plays were run for Webby in the second half. They didn’t find Rivard at all.”
 
On the importance of sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith…
 
CC: “I still think it’s crazy that we lost both those games.”
DF: “It’s weird how much our expectations have changed because this is basically a team with five guys that didn’t play at all for most of last year. And they’re probably only going to lose three in the Ivy League.”
HS: “After the games against Penn and Princeton, it’s interesting to think that now they have lost to both those teams and how much those wins were a fluke because of how Yatta played. He turned in a performance he probably won’t ever repeat.”
DF: “We saw against Princeton how bad it was when we didn’t have Yatta in rebounding. He’s really our only interior defender there.”
HS: “What he did besides the monster numbers was that he broke up Princeton’s rhythms and altered their shots.”
DF: “When you have a guy like that behind you that it helps a lot as far as knowing that on the perimeter you can focus more on denying them threes and not worrying about letting them go by you as much.”
 
On the growth of sophomore forward Steve Moundou-Missi…
 
HS: “I think Steve was really impressive at the line this weekend.”
DF: “Steve has been the most impressive person and most consistent Crimson player for us this weekend. He really works on us. He was out there two hours early.”
HS: “That was a major concern early in conference games it that he couldn’t hit free throws with any consistency but it definitely seems like he has figured it out and you can use him in these clutch situations down the stretch where he has a lot of composure."
 
On freshman guard Agunwa Okolie...
 
DF: “Agunwa’s an interesting player. He got the same recruiting grade at Yatta.”
MK: “He has the potential to be a Saunders-type defender on the perimeter and I think he came in a bit less raw offensively than Wes. Obviously Wes has taken ten steps forward but Agunwa is farther along at this point than Wes was midway through last season.”

On Friday night the Harvard men’s basketball team failed to overcome Princeton in Jadwin Gymnasium as it tried to retain its grip atop the Ivy League standings. An inspired late comeback left them agonizingly close as they fell just short in the final two minutes, setting up a two-horse race for the finish line in the Ivy standings.
Looking back at the history books, this is hardly the first time that Princeton has emerged victorious. Harvard and Princeton have competed in men’s basketball since 1901 and in that time the men in orange and black hold an imposing record of 129-41 in the series. Of all those losses though, a few stand out in the memory of Crimson fans:

1. Princeton 63, Harvard 62. March 12, 2011
Playing at Yale for the infamous one-game play-off, Princeton was down, 62-61, with 2.8 seconds left on the clock and inbounded the ball to Doug Davis. As he fell down to his left, Davis put up an off balance shot that had no right to drop. But as the buzzer rang, it was Princeton who had won the playoff game, sending them to the NCAA tournament as Harvard was left still waiting for its first appearance since 1946.
2. Princeton 76, Harvard 48. February 7, 1998
The Tigers ‘97-98 squad was one of the greatest Ivy teams in recent history. The team ended the season leading the country in winning percentage posting a record of 27-2 (14-0 Ivy), including a twenty game undefeated streak, and with a final AP ranking of 8th in the nation. The Crimson returned from Jersey outgunned and outclassed on the receiving end of a twenty eight point drubbing.
3. Princeton 70, Harvard 62. February 11, 2012
Arguably the strongest Harvard team of all time was ranked 25th in the nation as it travelled to New Jersey as favorites for the first time in recent memory. However, under the bright lights of national television Ian Hummer was imperious leading both teams with 20 points as the Tigers prevailed with a late surge. The win reopened the Ivy race, dropped Harvard out of the AP rankings for good, and was unprecedented enough that Princeton fans stormed the court in celebration.
4. Princeton 87, Harvard 56. February 15, 1964
One of the most famous Ivy players in history, Bill Bradley was the top player in the country coming out of high school. Averaging 29.8 points per game over his four years of college in an era without the three point line, he holds numerous Ivy records that could only be broken if the next LeBron James chooses the Ivy league and stays for four years. A three time All-American, Olympic gold medalist and most outstanding player of the 1965 NCAA tournament by the time he graduated, Bradley put clear daylight between the two teams during his four years at Princeton, easily carrying his team past the Crimson during this game. He would later go on to win two NBA championships with the Knicks (having his number 24 retired) and serve as a democratic senator in New Jersey for eighteen years. 
5. Princeton 54, Harvard 51. March 6 2010
Harvard’s best response to Bradley, Jeremy Lin, came forty years later and even he was unable to return to Cambridge with a win during his four years. He came closest his senior year as the Crimson led by seven at halftime. However, turnovers and missed free throws cost the team dearly in the second half as the Tigers scored the final four points of the game to extend their dominance in the rivalry.

Sophomore Amanda Sobhy recorded five straight sweeps this past weekend at the College Squash Association Women’s Individual National Championships at Trinity College to win her second straight Ramsay Cup.
Sobhy faced Kanzy El Defrawy of Trinity in the final, beating her, 11-4, 11-5, 12-10.
Sobhy remains undefeated through her collegiate career, a winning streak that now spans two full seasons. Even more impressive, Sobhy has only dropped one game through all of her wins, a first-game loss to El Defrawy on Feb. 6. Despite the dropped game, Sobhy went on to win, 6-11, 11-2, 11-6, 11-3.
“I think she was a little more nervous this time,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “Her opponent in the final, Kanzy, had taken a game off her in their match during the season, and this match was held on Kanzy’s home court.”
Sobhy did more than defend her title this weekend—she cemented herself as the player to beat in women’s squash. Sobhy entered the weekend as the No. 1 seed and heavy favorite, and she proved up to the task.
“Amanda was actually more dominating in this match, despite having to play on Kanzy’s home court and having the crowd against her,” Way said. “What stood out more than anything this time was [Sobhy’s] retrieving. She had some absolutely stunning gets.”
Sobhy cruised all weekend, starting off by allowing just five points in an easy 3-0 win over Gwendoline Tilgham of Yale. She also topped Rachel Goh of Penn, Danielle Letourneau of Cornell, and Yan Xin Tan of Penn by 3-0 margins on her way to the matchup with El Defrawy, who is Trinity’s No. 1.
“I just went in there and was very serious in each of my matches,” Sobhy said. “I didn’t fool around. I just went in there and got the job done.”
Coming into the national championships undefeated at the collegiate level, Sobhy had to deal with a unique type of pressure.
“She is just so much better than the rest of the competition that it really comes down to just getting the job done,” Way said. “The pressure is there because everyone simply expects her to win.”
Though Sobhy may have felt the pressure of being the favorite, her performance showed otherwise. Until the last game of the finals, no opponent scored more than five points against her in any game this weekend.
“I knew coming in that there would be a lot of pressure on me,” Sobhy said. “I just try not to think about that pressure. If I thought about it, that would create more pressure on me, so I just go in there and try to be relaxed as possible.”
Just two weekends ago, Sobhy helped lead Harvard to a 5-4 win over Trinity to capture the team’s national championship. She beat El Defrawy, 11-8, 11-7, 11-8, to clinch the title for the Crimson.
“It is an incredibly long season, so for [Sobhy] to come in and perform at her best is really impressive,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “She was just a powerhouse this weekend, and we are all so proud of what she has accomplished.”
Way, in his third year coaching at Harvard, says it is a privilege to work with Sobhy.
“When you have such an elite athlete, a coach has to look at very small details to help improve her game,” Way said. “You are looking to improve an area by two or three percent, so it is exciting to coach her from that point of view.”
Playing as the Crimson’s No. 1 all season, Sobhy also serves unofficially in a captain-like role on the team.
“Because of her level of play, there is a natural leadership about her,” Way said. “She always plays a leadership role on the team. How aware she is of that I am not sure, but [the coaches] are all very aware of it and very excited to have such leadership.”
Though she has already accomplished so much in her squash career, Sobhy cannot help but to look ahead to her next two years of collegiate squash.
“I just have to stay focused and know that it isn’t over yet,” Sobhy said. “The goal is to try and go four-for-four, so I am only halfway there.”
Way sees Sobhy’s desire to improve as the driving force in her success and understands her tendency to look towards the future.
“She has this determination to truly realize her full potential,” Way said. “We hear that a lot when it comes to student-athletes, but when you are at her level, you are hungry to prove yourself against the best in the world. She knows there is a much bigger pond out there than college squash, and that is what drives her [to keep improving].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team fell short of capturing the Sharpe Trophy in its first home regatta of the year this past weekend. After facing seven other teams in the team-racing regatta, the Crimson came out in fourth place with a 5-8 record for both days.
“Overall, our win-loss record may not have shown that we stuck with them,” freshman crew Jacob Bradt said. “In each race there was a marked improvement from the previous race.”
Head coach Michael O’Connor chose the six athletes who competed in the regatta. Sophomores Brian Drumm, Michael Drumm and Gram Slattery were the skippers competing this weekend, while freshman Sydney Karnovsky and junior Isabel Ruane joined Bradt as crews.
Harvard went 4-3 in the first open rounds, defeating the University of Vermont, No. 7 Boston College, No. 10 Tufts and No. 8 Roger Willams. The Crimson fell short to No. 2 Yale, MIT, and No. 9 Brown, last year’s New England Champions.
In the two final-four rounds, the Crimson went 1-5, which was good for its fourth-place finish.
Despite temperatures being mild on Saturday and Sunday, the weather did not work in the sailors’ favor, as there was a very light wind both days. Of the scheduled 20 races for Saturday, only three were actually conducted.
“In light air, the importance of boat handling…is really important,” Drumm said. “How you conduct [team] maneuvers depends on how good of boat handling you have.”
One of Harvard's greatest problems over the weekend was its starts. In team racing, the three boats from each school in the head-to-head match-up start in a marked area of the water. In the first leg of the there-and-back race, sailors are going against the wind, so whichever boat is in front has the advantage and ability to block the wind from its competitors in following FJs.
In its second match-up with Yale in the second round of final-fours, the Crimson went 4-5-6.
“We had two or three particularly bad starts, and it’s always a sinking feeling [when that happens],” Drumm said. “It’s always very unlikely that you’ll catch up.”
Improvement was an obvious theme for Harvard this weekend, as the relatively young squad focused on what it learned in the offseason to put forth on the water. The Crimson opened its spring season with this regatta, but has already been on the water five times for practice this semester.
“We had several opportunities in the offseason to sit down in a classroom setting and dissect some common situations in team racing,” Bradt said. “Team racing is a very technical side of the sport of sailing, so you need to have a firm grasp on these different situations and how each person in your boat has to react.”
Having extended chalk-talk with the team’s coaches, Drumm believes the team was able to get a better sense of strategy as it moves into the spring season.
“[The coaches] explained and reiterated what are some of the key maneuvers you can do to help your teammates,” he said.
In this weekend’s races, it was time to put this preparation to test. The team’s plays were both offensive and defensive, as the other schools would produce counter maneuvers.
“We had great communication on the water trying to help each other out, making sure we were all following the play,” Drumm said. “But one slip-up is all you really need to lose it.”
The time in the offseason and the exposures to the water already have been major reasons for the sailors’ belief that things are looking up for Harvard this spring season.
The Crimson squad is very young, with many freshman and sophomores amongst those who took part in the team racing at the Sharpe Trophy regatta. Looking ahead to the long-term, Bradt believes this composition will be highly beneficial after a year or two of working together as teammates.
“As a freshman, I have personally benefited from all the detail that we have gone into on the subject and the experience we have had,” he said.
Harvard’s spring season officially opened last weekend. The Crimson will be competing nearly every weekend this semester until the ICSA Championship in late May.
“Overall, I think our performance this weekend was a mark improvement from this past fall season,” Bradt said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 1.3 seconds left and Princeton up five on Friday, sophomore forward Jonah Travis tossed a lazy pass towards freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. Sprinting from the left block, Princeton forward Ian Hummer knocked the ball out of the air and out of bounds as time expired, putting a definitive stamp on his incredible night. Hummer’s 23 points and 14 boards were the driving force behind the Princeton men’s basketball team’s 58-53 triumph over Harvard. The painfully trite metaphor was very appropriate: opportunities slipping out of the team’s fingertips at the last moment.
The Crimson (17-9, 9-3 Ivy) started the weekend on top of the Ivy League and came out playing loose. Warming up for Friday’s game, the team was laughing and joking around. Assistant coach Yanni Hufnagel had guaranteed a win on Twitter; grinning sophomore forward Jonah Travis threw down a pair of windmill dunks during pregame warmups. Nearly 28 hours later, Christian Webster’s desperate final trey landed two feet short of the basket as the horn sounded at the Palestra, and the mood was anything but celebratory. Harvard had dropped consecutive road games at the Killer P’s, out-executed by both Penn and Princeton, which exposed its major weaknesses throughout miserable first halves.
Against Princeton (16-9, 9-2), the entire game was played on the Tigers’ terms. Chambers was contained, and the tempo of the game was slowed to favor Princeton, whose dizzying series of backcourt cuts made for an efficient half-court offense. Time and time again, Tiger guards found Hummer in the deep post, where he backed down anyone and everyone. Princeton is one of the tallest teams in the country and Harvard one of the smallest. The Tigers exploited this size well, collecting thirteen offensive rebounds and outrebounding the Crimson by thirteen on the night.
In the Palestra, against one of the smaller teams in the Ivy League in Penn, the Crimson faced a different set of problems. Penn’s depth and swarming defense exposed many of Harvard’s tendencies on offense. Quick hands led to a series of touch fouls, but the Quakers, who go eleven deep, consistently rotated fresh guards onto the Crimson backcourt, the members of which play nearly 40 minutes a game. A frustrated Chambers finished with more turnovers (seven) than points (five) or assists (five) and endured another struggle from the field.
The issues with depth and size were not unique to one game—Quaker forward Darien Nelson-Henry routinely beat sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith and Moundou-Missi to the basket off bruising pick-and-rolls, ending the game with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Princeton’s ability to bring quality shooters like Mack Darrow off the bench similarly bothered Harvard, whose four main guards (junior Laurent Rivard, senior Christian Webster, Chambers, Saunders) play almost the entire game, with a rotating center in the middle.
While Harvard started slow, on both nights it put together valiant comeback efforts that demonstrated the team’s heart. Down ten and showered with chants of “Where is Casey” and “Honor Code,” the Crimson went on a 15-2 run against Princeton to go up three with two minutes to play. In Philadelphia, the team was down as much as 16 late in the first half before clawing to within two on a late Webster three. Saunders routinely proved over the weekend that he is the best guard in the Ivy League, frequently creating his own offense when passed the ball with 10 seconds left on the shot clock and drawing contact in the lane. He shot 16 free throws over the weekend, and his 15 points in the first half against Penn single-handedly kept the team in the game.
Half a game back of Princeton with two home games to play, the Crimson may very well miss out on a playoff for the Ivy League title. A lot of basketball has yet to be played, and this weekend demonstrated that road games are no given in the Ancient Eight. This Crimson team, which relies heavily on a number of players who played little last year, has had a bitter first taste of March Madness. And with it comes the strong uncertainty as to whether it will get a second taste.

And here we go again, yet another set of rankings! 
Times Higher Education released its World Reputation Rankings, which its website explains "is based on nothing more than subjective judgement," albeit the judgement of "published, senior academics."
Harvard placed first in these reputation rankings with a perfect score of 100.0, just as it did in both 2012 and 2011, followed by neighboring Massachusetts Institute of Technology in second and the University of Cambridge in third. Princeton was the second-highest ranked Ivy League school, in seventh place with a "reputation score" of 36.2, while Yale rounded out the top ten with a score of 32.8.
Unfortunately, universities on the West Coast and overseas edged us out in the Times Higher Education's 2012-13 World University Rankings, where Harvard placed fourth with a score of 93.6 out of 100, behind the California Institute of Technology, Stanford, and Oxford. That's a slide from 2011-12's second place and 2010-11's first.
Oh, well. At least we have a good reputation!

The war for Yardfest opening act has been waged, and The Cantab Cowboys and Puttanesca have come out on top.
Last weekend at the Cambridge Queen's Head Pub, five student bands competed to earn a spot at this year's Yardfest.
So who of Harvard's own do we have to look forward to?
"The idea of the band is that we do interesting instrumentation on modern songs," said Nina L. Hooper '16, the harpist for Puttanesca. The band is an 11-piece ensemble that has everything from the drums to a harp to a yangqin, a Chinesen dulcimer. Hooper said she isn't sure as of yet what Puttanesca will be performing. "Were looking at maybe doing 'Sail' by Awolnation—something fun like that."
Matt R. Shuham '15, the drummer for The Cantab Cowboys, said the band plans to perform some of the songs that helped them win last weekend's battle of the bands. "We do a lot of classic country music, but also more modern stuff—a lot of indie rock and country rock mixes," he said. "We play some Mumford & Sons, some Black Keys, and a whole bunch of other stuff. We experiment with everything."
You can see both Puttanesca and The Cantab Cowboys at Yardfest in April.
