After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tim W. Wheaton, an associate director of athletics who has worked in the Athletic Department as an administrator and coach for about 30 years, will depart Harvard in January to serve as Colby College’s athletic director.
Wheaton served as a longtime head coach of the women’s soccer team, and in the 18 years of his tenure, the team played in eight NCAA tournaments and four Ivy League championships. Following his time as a coach, Wheaton worked in the Athletic Department as an assistant athletic director from 2005-2010; he became an associate director in 2010. He also assistant coached the men’s lacrosse team when he first came to Harvard in 1985.
As Colby’s new athletic director, Wheaton will oversee the school’s 32 Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference varsity teams.
“It’s bittersweet,” Wheaton said of his upcoming departure. “I’m excited about the opportunity, but I’m sad to leave a fantastic place that I owe so much to.”
Wheaton said he looks forward to taking on new challenges at Colby, but will greatly miss the Harvard community. His involvement on campus extended beyond the Athletic Department; he also served as a freshman proctor for six years, and his daughter was born while he was living in Grays Hall.
“I’m really grateful for the students and the people I was able to work with,” Wheaton said. “I’m excited to have an opportunity to take some of the things I’ve learned at Harvard as a coach and administrator and see if they can help Colby achieve their goals.”
Robert L. Scalise, Harvard’s Athletic Director, praised Wheaton in a statement in a press release detailing the upcoming departure.
“Tim had a great coaching career at Harvard and served our department very well during his tenure as an administrator,” Scalise said. “He has a real understanding of the challenges that student-athletes and coaches face. Tim is passionate about what he does, and he truly believes that athletics serve as an important educational resource.”
Katie E. Shields ’06, who played on the Harvard women’s soccer team when Wheaton coached the group, said Wheaton’s focus was “always much bigger than just soccer.” Shields now serves as head coach of the Saint Louis University women’s soccer team and credits her experience with athletics at Harvard as the reason she became a coach.
“I’m forever grateful for the way he prepared us as players and people in the program,” said Shields, who also assistant coached Harvard’s women’s soccer team before becoming head coach at SLU. “I try to do a lot of that in how I operate today [as head coach].”
Wheaton graduated from Drew University in New Jersey, where he played soccer and lacrosse. He was Drew’s 1983 athlete of the year and was later inducted into the school’s athletic hall of fame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After consecutive losses, the Harvard men’s basketball team (7-3) continues its three-game road trip looking for just its second win in five road games against Grand Canyon (8:00 p.m., American Sports Network). Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard closes out its 2014 schedule.
Failing to Close: After taking a 49-point loss a week earlier, the Crimson’s 10-point loss to Arizona State Sunday represented an improvement, but the performance was less than stellar. After putting up 23 combined points in the first half, Harvard’s starting backcourt of co-captain Siyani Chambers and senior wing Wesley Saunders had just two points on nine shots in the second half. Chambers continued his season-long struggles from the field, making just three of eight shots to bring his field goal percentage to 31 percent on the year. Harvard, which trailed by just four points at halftime, had just 18 points in the second half against arguably the PAC-12s worst team. Grand Canyon is a couple steps below Arizona State, but after failing to score 30 points in each of its last four halves, Harvard will want to jump early on the soft Antelope defense.
A Notable Trade-Off: Chambers, however, is just one-half of a struggling pair of co-captains for the Crimson. Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, arguably the team’s most consistent performer last season behind Saunders, has seen his offense shrink this year as he has taken a larger defensive role. The senior forward is averaging career highs in rebounds (6.5 a game) and blocks (2.1 a contests) but is shooting just over 40 percent from the field on nearly eight shot attempts a game after making 52 percent or more of his shots his first three years. Neither Moundou-Missi nor Chambers has provided effective spacing with what were advertised as improved jump shots, allowing opponents to clog the lane to shut down Saunders—whose game is based on his ability to get into the lane. The two co-captains are the clear players to watch as the Crimson move through the last half of its nonconference schedule.
Rounding Back Into Form: Harvard’s two worst offensive outputs of the season have coincided not only with the program’s first back-to-back losses since March of 2013. A possible explanation for the team’s struggles is the lack of practice time. Harvard had 13 days off before playing UVA during finals period and another seven days off before Arizona State, during which time many players went home for holiday celebrations. Various players joined the team directly in Phoenix instead of traveling with the rest of the squad, and the lack of practice is a possible cause for why a team that scored in the 70s five times in its first eight games barely cracked a combined 70 in its last two outings. The team has no more than six days off between each game in January, and with increased practice time may come a return to offensive form.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 13:31 left in the first half, senior wing Wesley Saunders barreled into the paint, head down, and drilled a short floater. Moments later, Saunders was calling for the rock once more. Grand Canyon had missed a jumper, and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers was pushing the ball up the court.
Chambers found his backcourt-mate waiting on the right wing. Saunders caught the ball, set his feet, and put up the trey. The shot was good, pushing the Crimson’s lead to seven.
And then, seemingly for the first time in weeks, Saunders smiled. The Antelopes called a timeout, and he chest bumped Chambers at mid-court. For the first time since its Dec. 8 game against Boston University, the Harvard men’s basketball team was rolling.
After losing consecutive contests to Virginia and Arizona State, the Crimson (8-3) outpaced Grand Canyon (8-8) from start to finish on Tuesday evening, earning the 72-59 victory at Grand Canyon University Arena in its final game of 2014.
“I thought our kids played with great energy and great purpose…[against] a terrific basketball team and in a great environment,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “It was really important for us to get off to a good start, and we did that. I thought we gained some confidence seeing the ball go through the basket, which is something we struggled with in the last two games.”
True to form, Chambers and Saunders led Harvard on the evening, with 16 and 15 points, respectively. And it was the tempo set by the Crimson backcourt that enabled Harvard to pull away from the home team early in the second period.
After Chambers found Saunders near the left elbow for a short jumper to beat the halftime buzzer, Saunders began post-break play in similar fashion. With the ball near the top of the key and the shot clock winding down, the senior stopped on a dime and drilled the jump shot, extending the Crimson’s lead to 12.
On the following Harvard possession, Chambers found his co-captain, forward Steve Moundou-Missi, on the left block. The big man connected. 38-24, Harvard.
Next, after an Antelopes' miss, Moundou-Missi sent an outlet pass to Chambers, who went coast-to-coast, using only one dribble to get from the right elbow to the left block, laying the ball in with his off-hand.
And so it went. A short corner jump shot from sophomore Corbin Miller minutes later gave the Crimson its then-biggest lead of the contest at 20, and, despite a bevy of Antelope layups in the game’s waning moments, Grand Canyon never truly threatened again.
“It was nice to get some rhythm on the offensive end, which allowed us to have some defensive energy against a ball club that, quite honestly, is an attacking, dangerous team,” Amaker explained. “We were able to get out of the box early, and [we] managed the game very well in a tough environment to do so against a team that brings a lot of fire power…. I thought our bench gave us a great lift, and our guys brought it home for us.”
Atypically, Harvard did most of its early damage from beyond the arc. In the first period, it shot a blistering 71.4 percent from downtown, while holding the home squad to only 37.5 percent from the field in the same span of time.
According to Saunders, the team’s previous two contests—its first pair of back-to-back losses in over 21 months—served as motivation to separate itself from its opponent as early as possible.
“We knew it was basically a must-win game [given the two prior losses], so we came out with a lot of energy and were able to sustain it,” Saunders said. “We knew we had to regroup…[and while] I think a lot of times we get off to slow starts and kind of build up to things, I think this game we hit first and were able to sustain throughout.”
The Antelopes were paced by point guard DeWayne Russell—who tallied 15 points, four rebounds, and three assists—and forward Daniel Alexander, who nearly doubled his season average with 15 points on the night.
For the Crimson, which ended its year just as it started it—with a double-digit win over a nonconference opponent—Tuesday’s victory was significant in that it allowed the team to get back to the style of play and the level of energy it wants to be performing at before league competition begins in mid-January.
“We’re getting there,” Amaker said. “We’re still searching for somewhat of a consistent identity, a consistent effort, but we’re moving closer. I think tonight was a big step towards that.”
Moundou-Missi echoed his coach’s sentiments, citing Amaker’s pre-game speech as key to the team’s play.
“Before [tip-off], Coach talked about coming into the game with a purpose and that no matter what, we’re going to fight until the end,” Moundou-Missi said. “So that’s what we did today. It was a focusing point to get our confidence back. The last couple games we lost that a bit, so it was important to just get into rhythm and get that confidence back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One day after gift-wrapping a 19-point loss to Louisiana Tech, the Harvard women’s basketball team completed the Georgia Tech Holiday Classic by earning a present of its own.
In the tournament’s consolation game, the Crimson (6-5) outmuscled Lipscomb (4-9) in an 84-63 victory in Atlanta, Ga. After shooting to an early lead, Harvard survived several waves of comeback attempts from the Lady Bisons to stay ahead for all 40 minutes of play.
“The game against Louisiana Tech yesterday really motivated us to fix the mistakes we made,” senior forward Temi Fagbenle said. “We were more consistent in the game today, and that is what we need to be every game.”
With 9:53 left in the second half, a Lipscomb squad that had played catch-up since the opening tip-off threatened to finally close the margin against the Crimson.
Buoyed by a trio of three-pointers, the Lady Bisons put together an 11-1 run that trimmed Harvard’s lead to seven points, the smallest gap since the opening minutes of play.
However, the combination of a Crimson timeout and a pair of substitutions quelled the damage. Over the next six minutes, Harvard outrebounded Lipscomb eight to three, nailed all six of its free throws, and rebuilt a 20-point advantage.
“We played pretty good defense other than letting them take some open shots during their comeback,” senior guard Ali Curtis said. “We knew that our offense would come as long as we were getting stops and making defensive plays.”
Senior forward Erin McDonnell, who contributed a pair of three-pointers during this stretch, led the Crimson with 19 points on the day. Fellow inside threats AnnMarie Healy and Fagbenle added 16 and 14 points, respectively.
Unlike Monday’s game, when Harvard trailed by double digits in the first period, the Crimson raced to a 35-10 advantage in the first 15 minutes of the contest.
Gritty post play underpinned Harvard’s early advantage. In the first 20 minutes of play, the Crimson came down with 12 more rebounds than the Lady Bisons.
“We learned from the scout that they don’t crash the rebounds well,” Fagbenle said. “We definitely took advantage of that at first by quickly checking them and crashing the boards.”
When the final whistle sounded, Harvard had accumulated a 46-24 rebounding advantage, with Fagbenle and McDonnell grabbing nine each. The Crimson also emerged with 21 second-chance points compared to Lipscomb’s nine.
Harvard guards played a significant role in this. Crimson ball handlers totaled a combined 16 boards, including six by junior guard Shilpa Tummala.
“The guards actually recognized that we needed to step up our rebounding game,” Curtis said. “[We] focused on helping our forwards on the boards. There was a dramatic difference, and it really aided our victory.”
Despite a disadvantage in the paint, the Lady Bisons refused to go away. During a one-minute period at the beginning of the second half, Lipscomb made three consecutive threes to eat away at a 20-point deficit.
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith responded by calling a timeout and swapping out several starters for bench players. The second unit delivered. Junior guard Kit Metoyer made two free throws, Tummala hit a three, forward Destiny Nunley grabbed a steal, and the Crimson used a 10-2 run to push the score to 59-40.
“We simply kept our wits about us and realized that we just needed to continue to attack,” Fagbenle said. “We focused on defense and stopping them from scoring all those outside three-pointers…. Our offense came as a result.”
The blowout score obscured an impressive team effort from the Lady Bisons. Four Lipscomb players finished in double figures, with forward Ashley Southern and guard Chandler Cooper tallying 14 points apiece.
Over the final four minutes of play, Harvard rested its starters. But the Lady Bisons never got closer than 18 points from the Crimson in the closing stages.
“Our game was won on the defensive end and with rebounding,” Curtis said. “Overall we needed to play our game of basketball, and that’s what we did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard and Rensselaer men’s ice hockey teams entered their final tilt of 2014 streaking in opposite directions. The Crimson made its way to the ice having won six consecutive games, while the Engineers had dropped their last five.
But after one period of play, you hardly would have been able to tell.
Playing in its first intercollegiate matchup in 24 days, No. 4/4 Harvard (10-1-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) showed some rust in the early going, mustering just four shots on goal in the opening frame. Meanwhile, RPI (6-13-1, 4-5-0) generated its best start in over a month, creating 13 shots of its own and carrying a 2-1 lead into the first intermission.
Nonetheless, sparked by a three-goal surge in the first four minutes of the second period, the Crimson notched its seventh consecutive victory, defeating the Engineers, 6-2.
“There wasn’t a lot of hanging heads or negativity [after the first period],” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “The guys responded really well right from the first shift in the second.”
Trailing after the first period for the first time all season, the Crimson offense burst onto the scene on that opening shift. Harvard got its equalizer just over 20 seconds into the frame, and it came from a likely source—junior forward Jimmy Vesey.
Vesey assumed his position just outside the slot, as junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo made his way behind the net. Seeing his linemate, Criscuolo sent a pass in the forward’s direction—one that Vesey put home for his tenth goal of the season.
“I think what makes [Vesey] so dangerous an offensive player is that he’s very versatile,” Donato said. “He’s very willing to go into the dirty areas, get the tough rebounds, and [make] plays in front of the net.”
The Crimson offense was just getting started. Harvard broke the game open three minutes later with two goals scored only nine seconds apart.
Sophomore forward Phil Zielonka logged the goal to put the Crimson ahead. Looping behind the net, sophomore winger Devin Tringale delivered a pass to Zielonka inside the crease, where he muscled it home.
Seconds later, Harvard struck again, as Criscuolo found sophomore forward Tyler Moy streaking up the slot on a two-on-one. Bringing the puck to his right, Moy fired a shot past the left pad of Engineers' netminder Jason Kasdorf.
Prior to Tuesday, Kasdorf had been sidelined by an injury for a month. In the former ECAC Rookie of the Year’s absence, RPI had dropped five straight games by an average of over five goals per game.
Thus, after the first period of play, Kasdorf’s return looked like it might pay dividends. But in the end, junior goaltender Steve Michalek got the better of his adversary, making 33 saves on the night.
“[Michalek] is one of the more talented goalies I’ve ever skated with and been on a team with,” co-captain Max Everson said. “A guy like Steve is the reason we’re able to come out of that first period only down one goal.”
The Crimson put the game away early in the final frame on a goal by Moy on a four-on-three chance from the left dot. Playing on the first line in the absence of sophomore forward Alexander Kerfoot, Moy has recorded at least a point in five straight games.
“Once Kerfoot got hurt, Moy seamlessly just started gelling with [Vesey and me],” Criscuolo said. “He’s found his niche at center with us. We trust each other, and we’re starting to learn where each other are on the ice.”
Harvard’s six-goal performance looked plausible early on after sophomore forward Luke Esposito got the scoring started 1:21 into the contest. But the reins fell off shortly afterwards.
After missing his last three games due to injury, Engineers’ forward Drew Melanson was effective in his return, notching the equalizer three minutes later. The freshman took a pass down low from captain Matt Neal and put it past Michalek for his team-leading eighth point of the year.
A barrage of RPI chances followed, and the Engineers finally jumped ahead at the 13:19 mark of the period courtesy of senior forward Zach Schroeder. The goal marked the first time the Crimson has surrendered multiple goals in the first frame all year.
That would be the last of the offense that RPI could generate, however, as Harvard grabbed control of the contest in the middle frame. Freshman forward Seb Lloyd later capped the scoring for the Crimson with less than ten minutes remaining, picking up the first collegiate goal of his career.
“This was an important game for us because we knew that in the league, we weren’t going to be able to get any points over the next two weekends,” Donato said. “We want to remain near the top of our league and challenge to win [it].”
