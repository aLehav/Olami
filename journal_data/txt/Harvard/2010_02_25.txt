After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Class Day has always been an occasion for the Harvard senior class to select a prominent public individual to deliver a stimulating and humorous speech, as a quick scan of the roster of speakers indicates. In the past, classes have invited everyone from former U.S. Presidents such as Bill Clinton in 2007 to comedians like Will Ferrell in 2003. While some of those names may be bigger than this year’s choice, we have no doubt that Christiane Amanpour, CNN’s chief international correspondent, will provide the Class of 2010 with a unique, global perspective that is very worthy of all seniors’ attention.
As one of today’s most fearless journalists—not to mention one of the most highly respected names on television—Amanpour’s accomplishments speak for themselves. From her impassioned coverage of the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War to her famed 2002 phone interview with Yasser Arafat, Amanpour has reported on location from more danger zones and interviewed more notorious and controversial figures than most of her colleagues in either Europe or the United States. With her own show, “Amanpour,” which debuted this past September, she has now begun to push the envelope for U.S. television journalism by devoting more attention to in-depth investigations viewed with an international lens. Before last year’s Class Day speech, students complained that speaker Matt Lauer was hardly a relevant choice. As such, we applaud the Class Day committee’s apparent decision to reevaluate its selection standards, and we challenge anyone to say the same of Amanpour as they did of Lauer.
Amanpour is also the first woman to speak at Class Day since 1994, when Lani C. Guinier ’71, then assistant attorney general for civil rights, was chosen. The speakers themselves send messages just as important as the contents of their speeches, and we believe that the selection of a woman—an extremely qualified, experienced, and talented woman—has the potential to inspire more than just Harvard women to achieve new heights of success.
Along the same lines, we feel that inviting a journalist of the highest caliber to speak at Class Day will serve to inspire those students interested in pursuing journalism after they leave Harvard. The College offers substantial counseling and resources for those planning to enter the celebrated worlds of finance, consulting, medicine, and law, but journalism is a career path often overlooked and, in some respects, neglected altogether. Although traditional media forms—including print newspapers like this one—may become obsolete in the years ahead, we cannot stress enough the importance of eager and intelligent young people who can usher the field of journalism into the next generation and guarantee its continued relevance to society. As members of a news organization ourselves, we at The Crimson could not have asked for a more inspiring speaker than Christiane Amanpour.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Passing the buck is one of the oldest and most often used traditions of democracy. At the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland last January, admonishment for bankers on one hand and praise for President Obama on the other were abundant.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet applauded the Obama administration’s intervention in the U.S. banking system and blamed bankers for “generating the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.”
However, responsibility for the global financial crisis cannot be blamed on bankers alone. The U.S. government and homeowners played an important part in the web of high leverage, high pricing of assets, and greed that entangled the American financial system. Much of the controversy surrounding the question of who to blame arises from the objective of proportionally allocating the appropriate blame to the appropriate party.
At issue are the misleading tactics that banks used to lure first-time homebuyers. First-time homebuyers aiming to fulfill the American Dream of owning a home were not irrational in their decision to sign a contract for a home whose mortgage they clearly could not afford. The transaction occurred between the banks and consumers who were both financially dysfunctional, their financial dysfunction stemming from amassing excessive debt and experiencing mortgage aversion.  These were, at times, educated people who made poor financial decisions and miscalculated the risks involved.
President Obama, during his State of the Union address, told the country that it was going broke. But the rules of road as they are facilitated debt accumulation and high leveraging of assets. Bankruptcy laws, first-time homebuyer tax credits, and non-recourse loans all give the uninformed consumer incentive to buy a new home. Lest we as a people and as members of the largest economy in the world go bankrupt, we need to make policy decisions that bind all parties involved to a common fabric.
At Davos, French President Nicolas Sarkozy blamed globalization for the financial crisis. However, what we need is more, not less, globalization—Michael Dawson, a political science Professor at the University  of Chicago, devised the term “linked fate,” a concept in which interdependence, which is similar to globalization, is key to promoting group interests above individual interest.  In determining public policy, powerful social concepts such as linked fate can be very useful for coming up with practical and sustainable solutions. To remedy the financial whooping cough Americans are going through, policy experts, banks, municipalities, and individuals should form a community advisory board. This panel would consist of respected members of the community—small business owners, local bank executives, parents, teachers, lawyers, etc.—who would strictly advise, not mandate, whether those seeking to buy a home are capable of deciding for themselves what is in their best short-term and long-term interests.
Creating multiple linked fate communities for the sake of financial recovery will be tough. But if defaulting on a mortgage hurts the local bank, which in turn hurts the local businesses and the community as a whole, then all parties will be much more meticulous when it comes to making financial decisions. Real estate agents who aim to make a profit will have less incentive to be deceptive because they will shop at the same small businesses that will require loans from the local bank to operate, which in turn will require the homeowners to be current on their mortgages to lend out more money.
What seems to be a complex web of interconnected and interdependent relationships in fact already exists in the form of globalization. The only difference is that, with globalization, activity at the microscopic level can have macroscopic ramifications if left unchecked. President Obama should emphasize increased globalization. By making people more interdependent and creating more linked fate communities across the globe, greed and excess on the part of bankers, laxity in regulation by governments, and poor financial decisions on the part of home buyers will be disincentivized, as individual interests will be secondary to group interests. The world as we know it will move toward greater cooperation and consensus and the buck will finally stop being passed around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, a visiting scholar at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs made a proposal that left the blogosphere up in arms. During a speech at the Herzliya Conference in Israel on Feb.3, Kramer argued that the United Nations Relief and Works Agency should cease providing the citizens of Gaza with what he deemed to be “pro-natal” aid (aid that “deliberately encourages births”) to curtail its population’s radicalization. In a clip posted on his blog, Kramer asserts that the subsidies currently offered by the UNRWA have caused the average age of Gaza’s citizens to remain remarkably low, thus creating an inordinately large youth population that can very easily turn to extremism. To facilitate a de-radicalization of Gaza, therefore, he asserts that the U.N. should cease providing its population with these subsidies. In response, numerous blogs and websites including, most notably, Electronic Intifada, have charged Kramer with promoting Palestinian genocide. While this claim appears baseless, the United Nations should flatly reject Kramer’s advice on the grounds that it is both morally offensive and strategically inept.
Kramer’s proposal is ethically unacceptable. The “pro-natal subsidies” that he recommends eliminating provide—by his own admission—guaranteed minimum standards of food and education for children. These are basic human rights, not luxuries offered by the UNRWA to encourage more births. To even call the subsidies “pro-natal” is extremely misleading, since the aid is clearly intended for children that already exist, rather than parents. Furthermore, even if the cessation of these subsidies would eventually normalize Gaza’s population, which we do not believe to be true, this shift would not take effect for nearly decades after the aid’s removal. Relying on a policy that works so slowly, when citizens of Gaza are suffering on a daily basis, is unthinkable—not to mention the Palestinians who could starve as a result.
On a practical level, Kramer’s suggestion is also unwise. In an environment like Gaza, cutting off basic subsidies would inherently trap young Palestinians in a sphere of helplessness that makes violence all the more appealing. Propagating education and a decent standard of living is a much more effective method of curtailing extremism than attempting to restrict the production of, as Kramer calls them, “superfluous young men.”
However, despite these concerns, the blogosphere clearly overreacted in perpetuating the genocide meme created by Electronic Intifada and others. While the 1948 U.N. Convention does delineate “measures intended to prevent births” as a form of genocide, Kramer was not advocating an ethnic cleansing of Gaza’s citizens, but rather a shift in the average age of their population with the intention of, in his opinion, benefiting them in the long run. Considering the content of Kramer’s speech, labeling his policy as “genocide” is unfair, and steers the debate away from his actual argument.
Although we disagree with Kramer’s politics, creating a thriving marketplace of ideas among academic Fellows at Harvard can only benefit the University as a whole. Indeed, a major goal of the Weatherhead Center is to promote “vigorous, sustained intellectual dialogue” within the Harvard community, and a diverse view like Kramer’s will certainly foster the sort of debate the center seeks to promote. Although we question Kramer’s judgment, we refrain from questioning his continued presence at the Center and the legality of his statement in light of the U.N. Convention on Genocide. We encourage the blogosphere to follow suit.

For those who doubt America’s leadership, its political system, or its economy, there is one fact that is not up for debate: Americans are charitable people.  Even during the worst economic climate since the Great Depression, U.S. chartable giving exceeded 300 billion dollars. We have seen this charitable spirit at Harvard; following the 7.0 earthquake that has devastated Haiti, Harvard students, in cooperation with the Office of the President, Harvard College Dean’s Office, and the Office of Fine Arts, established Harvard for Haiti, an organization which has raised just over 23,000 dollars so far.  Although efforts like Harvard for Haiti are absolutely a step in the right direction, Harvard, and especially its students, can offer something more valuable to the international community than fundraising.
Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with excelling at raising money. But, as the Haiti disaster has demonstrated, the main problem is not raising enough money; rather, it is making sure that donated goods arrive in an efficient manner. Harvard should facilitate finding solutions to fundamental problems like this, as well as aiding with temporary relief efforts. To do this, the administration should create a prize program named HarvardforHumanity. Modeled after the Harvard Catalyst and InnoCentive Prize for Innovation, HarvardforHumanity would be a prize competition, soliciting both answers and questions to different challenges with a focus on seeking solutions to humanitarian problems throughout the world.
As a prize competition, HarvardforHumanity could choose a series of developmental challenges to tackle and award start-up capital for winning teams to bring their ideas to fruition. With the disaster in Haiti drawing much of the world’s attention, the inaugural edition might solicit ideas to maximize the efficiency of airplanes landing and taking off from Haiti’s lone airstrip. Challenges would be specific, yet varied, such as how to maximize the efficiency of doctors arriving and departing from Port-Au-Prince or create a more portable and cost-effective way to purify drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa. If the answer to a challenge is not found, however, HarvardforHumanity would also solicit and reward entries that explain what is needed for further progress on the goal. Thus, the winning entry becomes a new challenge posed by HarvardforHumanity and even technical failure result in a step forward for the overall challenge goal.
The beauty of HarvardforHumanity is that it could have multiple prizes with different completion deadlines running at the same time.  Challenges would be created to address short-term problems or disasters that strike without warning, or long-standing issues that afflict scores of people around the world. In that sense, HarvardforHumanity serves as both a community service idea engine and a global problem solver. Thus, the point is not that the best ideas come from Harvard internally. It is that although good ideas may come from outside Harvard’s campus, it is Harvard that sees their potential and gives them a chance to grow.
Not only would HarvardforHumanity attract attention to Harvard, but it will also attract the right attention. Rather than being in the news for huge drops in its endowment, Harvard could be in the news for finding a new way to deliver supplies to disaster stricken areas. Most importantly, however, HarvardforHumanity positions Harvard as a leader in humanitarian ideals. As a premier research institute and university, Harvard has clearly set itself a goal to advance human knowledge. But in translating that goal to undergraduate education, perhaps we are aiming too low by just educating the next generation of humanitarian leaders. Harvard students come up with innovative and ingenious ideas to small problems on a regular basis—witness last term’s Computer Science 50 fair—and with a little prodding, they can set their attentions on bigger prizes right now. With HarvardforHumanity, we can certainly take big steps to ensure that help reaches those who need it the most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the politically active on the Right, Spring Break came early. Last weekend, over ten thousand conservatives descended on Washington, D.C. for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. They packed the capital’s largest hotel complex for the most scrutinized political gathering in a non-convention year. For three days a who’s-who line up of conservative Republicans and not-so-unannounced 2012 primary contenders rallied the largely college-aged crowd.
Then, on Saturday, the Right’s newest frat boy took the stage. To cheers and applause, Glenn Beck offered the keynote address—a potpourri of anti-Obama vitriol, bipartisan criticism, and personal anecdotes. But as Professor Beck leapt from the podium to his beloved chalkboard, reading glasses perched low on his nose, he lambasted the calls for a return to a “Big Tent” party, asking sardonically, “What is this, a circus?” And in one sentence he did more damage than most speakers can in a whole speech.
The problem with those who denounce Reaganesque Big Tentism is twofold. First, to condemn is to invite electoral impotence. It is neither a strategy for winning elections nor a recipe for good governance. Scott Brown did not win in Massachusetts by appealing to a narrow conservative base. The congressional Republicans of the 1990s did not pass welfare reform by refusing to compromise with Bill Clinton.
Second, and maybe more significantly, ridiculing a big tent party masks the truth and jeopardizes the party’s future.  It prevents those on the outside from seeing that the Tent truly is big, inclusive, and dynamic.  It validates James Carville when he proclaims “Reagan’s Big Tent has collapsed.” It allows The Wall Street Journal  to summarize the CPAC weekend as highlighting a “split” in the party.  But these assessments and our easy acceptance of them are wrong.  The party has its inclusivity problems, but even CPAC 2010 was a surprisingly Big Tent if you took the time to notice.
Sure, from the outside, CPAC appears to be an exercise in narrow-minded dogmatic groupthink, offering little for thoughtful discussion and more than enough material for late-night lampooning. The speakers typically spoon-feed an eager audience exactly what they paid to hear. Romney for President 2.0. Revolutionary Storytelling with Michele Bachmann. An Excoriation of Woodrow Wilson by Dr. Ron Paul: Or, Why Warren Harding was a Great Man. (Maybe not so much that one.)
But while panelists defended Bush-era security policy, an anti-war reception was filled to capacity. The audience enthusiastically greeted a surprise visit from Dick Cheney, even as others railed against the Patriot Act his team crafted. Activists defended the legalization of marijuana in the hallways, and a new group called Whole Life sought to expand the pro-life movement into one with a larger social justice message. In the Exhibition Hall two booths down from the National Organization for Marriage, members of GOProud advocated for gay rights. And this wasn’t voluntary cognitive dissonance. It was the marketplace of ideas at work. It was a Big Tent.
And here’s the irony: the man who championed the Big Tent is the one Beck and company most exalt. Any good CPAC speech pays tribute to the Great Communicator, but while Ronald Reagan was certainly principled, he was never needlessly divisive. He knew that the politics of division obscures the truth and ensures newcomers never come in; It says quite unequivocally to outsiders, “Stay out!” But while I’ll argue that CPAC is more diverse than some portray it, the obvious truth still remains: the Republican Party falls short with minorities, with youth, with the coastal intelligentsia. And divisive, purist language ensures that the GOP remains caricatured as the domain of southern white males.
Now I do give Beck some credit. The comment in question served as a segue into an indictment of Republicans who broke campaign promises and voters’ trust. But even if such language is simply a starting point for a more nuanced position on adhering to fiscal responsibility, it matters little. The sound bite  is recorded, the message sent, and the damage done. Though to be fair, Glenn Beck is neither a politician nor a strategist. He does not need to concern himself with electioneering or governing. He bills his eponymous show as “the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment.” And that means that he is a Party of One without consequence.
But the GOP cannot. Obama’s plummeting popularity has made right wing commentators overconfident. Independents have discovered why they dislike Democrats, but that does not mean they have cause to love Republicans again. The GOP has to represent more than the lesser of two evils. The party needs to grow and evolve, and telling new voters and fresh candidates they’re unwelcome will ensure they pitch a tent elsewhere.
So here’s the message, especially to those indecisively sitting in the Middle: though it must grow, the GOP Tent is bigger than you think.  Don’t believe me?  Come on in and see for yourself.  You’re always welcome.

Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert D. Putnam led a discussion about the psychological benefits of community building last night in the keynote event to Harvard’s ninth annual Mental Health Awareness Week.
Putnam, a public policy expert who has written extensively on the decline in social and civic engagement among Americans, focused his remarks on the importance of forming social networks to promote psychological well-being.
“As a risk factor for premature death, social isolation is as big a risk factor as smoking,” Putnam said in his speech, which was cosponsored by the Wellness Center, the Harvard Student Mental Health Liaisons, and the Harvard Mental Health Awareness and Advocacy Group.
Putnam also discussed a number of historical trends that led Americans to join fewer clubs, spend less time with their families, and disengage socially over the last third of the 20th century.
“Television is about half of the story, actually,” Putnam said. “Watching the news is good for your civic health. But most people aren’t watching the news. They’re watching ‘Friends,’ instead of having friends.”
Putnam also noted that the generation of individuals who grew up in the aftermath of Sept. 11 appeared to be reversing this trend by forming stronger and more lasting social connections. But he tempered this optimism by pointing out that the trend is occurring along class lines—working class youth are more likely than ever to be emotionally and interpersonally isolated.
“I do think that class gap is an important qualification on what would otherwise be a good news story—the story that this is the generation that is going to save America,” Putnam said.
Following his speech, Putnam entertained questions from his audience about Facebook, immigration, and the implications of increasing diversity on communities.
“I think he’s a fantastic speaker,” said Elizabeth A. Goodman-Bacon ’10, co-director of the Harvard Student Mental Health Liaisons. “He strikes a good balance of providing evidence with accessible discourse on what’s actually happening in America today.”
Goodman-Bacon added that she was pleased to see a diverse group of Harvard undergraduates and graduate students turn out for the event.
Paul Barreira, the director of behavioral health and academic counseling at Harvard University Health Services, said he had sought out Putnam to deliver the keynote speech as part of an ongoing effort to create a caring and supportive community at Harvard.
“If you ever check into Harvard FML postings, you’ll see things like, ‘I’m so alone, my life sucks,’” Barreira said. “That’s why we asked him to speak.”
Mental Health Awareness Week will conclude tomorrow with mental health study breaks in all of Harvard’s undergraduate houses.

A record number of 494 students are jockeying for the Institute of Politics’ Director’s Internships, though the number of open slots remains limited to 50.
The IOP expects a final total of over 500 applications, which marks a 43 percent increase from last year’s figure, according to IOP’s internship program administrator Amy A. Howell. Even last year, the program received an unprecedented number of applications upon expanding the number of available positions from 40 to 50.
IOP Director Bill Purcell largely attributed the spike in application numbers to students’ increased focus on public service. The faltering economy and difficult job market have also contributed to college students’ growing interest in public service careers, Purcell said.
“I think that the financial crisis definitely has a huge impact, but the impact isn’t just that people can’t get well-paying jobs in the private sector,” said IOP President Kenzie Bok ’11. “It’s also that when people think about what kind of meaningful work they could be doing, there’s been a swing back towards the public sector.”
In response to the increase in interest, the IOP is considering offering a larger number of internships next year and hiring a public service career counselor, according to Purcell.
The IOP has been committed to maintaining the number of Director’s Internships in spite of the University’s recent financial constraints and widespread budget cuts, Purcell said. He added that career services is an area in which the IOP can increase its contributions to the College.
The internship program offers Harvard undergraduates a $4,000 stipend for eight- to ten-week internships at domestic or international political or public service organizations. It includes placements at The Colbert Report, the offices of Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and Parliamentary offices in Great Britain.
Purcell said that the IOP has worked to create an offering of internships that represents a diverse array of political opportunities—including new placements at the Republican National Committee and the offices of New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
Christopher W. Danello ’12, the IOP’s student chair of internships, said that the greater diversity of programming has attracted more applicants. He added that students are attracted to the hands-on experience afforded by Director’s Internships.
“It’s not just doing the menial tasks that a lot of internships in politics for college students are,” Danello said.
While the deadline for most applications passed last Friday, applications to Google and EchoDitto—a Cambridge-based internet-strategy firm—are due Mar. 1.

At an open house complete with balloons and candy, Lamont Library celebrated yesterday the establishment of its new multimedia lab, providing undergraduates with a central location to edit music, video, audio, and general media projects.
Located on Level A of the library, the lab houses four state-of-the-art video centers, two image centers, and one audio center, and features both Mac and Windows operating systems and two MIDI keyboards.
The lab is accessible to all undergraduates whenever Lamont is open, all seven days of the week and even when the library is operating on a 24-hour schedule.
The lab is the product of a collaboration between the Science Center’s Technology Showcase and the media center in Lamont, as well as a joint cooperation between personnel in Faculty of Arts and Sciences departments and the Academic Technology Group—which supports technology-enhanced teaching and learning in FAS.
Prior to the opening of the center, special labs had their own policies regarding access for students of specific concentrations, such as the department of visual and environmental studies, according to Paul M. Worster, a multimedia librarian at Lamont.
Now, with the opening of the new multimedia center, undergraduates will have a convenient location to access the wide range of available equipment.
“Things are so much more cross-disciplinary now,” Worster said. “People are using media outside of disciplines that are just made for media.”
The importance of media technology is on the rise, according to Martin M. Schreiner, the head of maps, media, data, and government information in Lamont Library: “[Media] is becoming like word processing,” he said. “It’s ubiquitous.”
The new multimedia lab will also offer support services for students with questions about media projects and technology.
Kevin T. Guiney, a member of the Academic Technology Group, said that the important part of the new multimedia lab is not only its machinery, but also its staff workers, who will “consult with people through the life cycles of their projects.”
Bridget P. Haile ’11, a Music concentrator, expressed her enthusiasm for the new lab’s technological offerings.
“I’m a performing musician...It would be great to have somewhere to record music to send off for summer programs and applications,” Haile said about the new media lab. “It sounds like a great resource.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections and clarification:
CORRECTION: February 25, 2010
An original version of the Feb. 25 news article "Lamont Opens New Multimedia Lab" incorrectly stated that Lamont Library's multimedia lab will be accessible five days of the week for all undergraduates. In fact, the lab will be accessible whenever Lamont is open, every day of the week.
The article also stated that the College allowed access to special labs for students of specific concentrations. In fact, each lab had its own policies, and the College did not specifically outline the allowances, according to Paul M. Worster, a multimedia librarian at Lamont.
CLARIFICATION: February 25, 2010
An original version of the Feb. 25 news article "Lamont Opens New Multimedia Lab" stated that the lab is located on the first basement level of the library. To clarify, the lab is located on Level A of Lamont.

The hiring of a new Chinese Language Program director for the upcoming academic year remains uncertain for the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, according to Department Chair Wilt Idema.
The department currently awaits the administration’s final word on the possible authorization of a search to fill the vacancy created by current director Shengli Feng, who is slated to leave Harvard this fall, Idema said in an interview yesterday.
The decision to open a new search—a process that can take many months—will not be finalized until April, when Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith determines which searches to authorize for the upcoming year, according to Idema.
Feng, a Chinese professor who has served a key role in the development of Harvard’s Chinese Language Program, will leave Harvard for the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Feng said he will be better compensated in a tenure-track position that allows him to devote more energy to his scholarship than he currently can in the managerial post of director.
Finding a replacement for Feng is “extremely important” for the health of Harvard’s Chinese language offerings, said Idema, who added that he hopes the department will be allowed to run a search within the next year.
Though FAS is in a better financial situation than last spring, Smith has said in the past that he plans to reduce the size of the faculty through attriation to help eliminate FAS’ deficit.
This past year, EALC had two searches authorized, one of which resulted in the hiring of David Howell, who will teach early modern Japanese history beginning next fall.
“Although a search for a new director of the Chinese Language Program has not been authorized at this time, the program continues to be well-staffed, organized, and coordinated,” FAS spokesman Jeff A. Neal wrote in an e-mailed statement.
“The student-teacher ratio is low, demonstrating that we are investing seriously in the teaching of Chinese,” Neal added, citing the nine preceptors and ten drill instructors whom Feng currently oversees.
Diana Sorensen, the FAS divisional dean for the arts and humanities, wrote in an e-mailed statement that finding Feng’s replacement is among the priorities of the division.
“[Feng’s] leaving is a great loss for Harvard,” said Yu Feng, Shengli Feng’s former college roommate and a former Chinese language preceptor at Harvard who now heads Brandeis’ Chinese language program. “This is really sad to say, but that’s true. You won’t find anyone who can really replace him.”

Last night at Gutman Library, a group of students from the Harvard Graduate School of Education presented the preliminary results of their efforts to expand literary education internationally, and appealed to the administration and public to keep the project alive.
Learning Through Libraries is the brainchild of Jill A. Carlson, Eleanor B. O’Donnell, and Debra L. Gittler. Back in August, the three GSE students in international education policy envisioned a project that would help them gain teaching experience abroad—which is not provided in the GSE curriculum.
During their trip to El Salvador, the trio helped to establish three new libraries at primary schools in the poor municipality of Caluco, as well as two mural exhibits and one photography workshop to educate children through storytelling and the arts.
Yesterday, seven months after the conception of the project, the fruits of Learning Through Libraries were celebrated at an exhibition of the Caluco children’s photography.
“Books alone don’t make a difference,” Gittler said at the reception last night, “but relationships do.”
Gittler and her colleagues, who will graduate in the spring, said they hope that GSE Arts in Education Program Coordinator Scott K. Ruescher—the only staff member on the trip to El Salvador—will be able to pass their project on to a new class of GSE students.
Last night’s gathering was also attended by the joint student council of Cambridge’s Amigos School and Martin Luther King, Jr. School, which coordinated efforts to collect over 700 books for the library effort.
The collaboration at the graduate level was mirrored at the junior high school level, allowing the younger students to “connect with their peers and embrace others’ cultures through education,” said Michael C. Batt, a social studies teacher at Amigos and one of the student council coordinators.
“There are many ways to tell a story,” said Briget C. Ganske, who studies arts in education at GSE and taught the photography workshop in El Salvador. “I really believe in the power of photography to communicate emotions, and it was so wonderful to share that experience and see the kids get excited about it.”
O’Donnell said that Learning Through Libraries plans to open two more libraries by the end of the semester.
To ensure that the project endures beyond their graduation, the outgoing GSE students are working with the administration to turn the El Salvador project into a January term course for credit, according to Lisa J. Mulvey, a student at GSE who helped coordinate the administrative aspects of the project.
“We really hope to continue the project and make it sustainable and long lasting,” O’Donnell said. “This isn’t the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They met in Brazil and fell in love.
James L. Cavallaro ’84, now a Harvard Law School professor and executive director of the HLS Human Rights Program, was speaking at a conference about the military dictatorship that had menaced the South American state for 21 years. Meanwhile, Nadejda Marques was running late en route to the conference. Fate would have it that her mother was considerate enough to save Marques a seat—right in front of Cavallaro.
After the conference, the resident of the Portugese-speaking nation shocked the guest speaker with her near-perfect English. Later, Marques offered to help Cavallaro, a vegetarian, navigate the meat-heavy Brazilian restaurant scene. Language would further unite them, as their multilingualism allowed the pair to banter in what Cavallaro calls “Portuinglês.” But most important of all was their shared passion for advancing human rights across the globe.
“He’s an attractive man and he stands for the things I believe, so I was like, ‘He’s the one,’” recalls Marques, a slender woman with a bright smile and quiet demeanor.
Three years later on Dec. 30, 1998, Cavallaro and Marques exchanged vows in Rio de Janeiro. Renting an apartment overlooking the beach, the newlyweds held both a wedding party and a New Year celebration, a holiday complete with music and fireworks rivaled in Rio only by Carnival, Brazil’s most famous festival.
The couple may have begun their new lives together on the cusp of a new year, but even as they replace Professor Richard W. Wrangham and Elizabeth A. Ross as Currier House Masters this fall, they will not stray from their initial raison d’être: to share their experiences with others and promote human rights and social justice.
HARVARD ROOTS
Cavallaro, a Brooklyn native, chose to concentrate in Government at Harvard, focusing on domestic politics—but in many ways, it would be surprising for a student at the College today to make the same choices Cavallaro did at Harvard less than 30 years ago.
For one, the interim Currier House Master appointee withdrew from the traditional House system. Cavallaro lived in Cabot House—then called South House—as a sophomore, but after that year, he fled the Radcliffe Quadrangle to be closer to his older sister, then-Adams resident Rosanna J. Cavallaro ’83. He eventually settled into an apartment on 65 Mt. Auburn Street.
Cavallaro, like many of his peers, strayed from what is now a typical summer internship path. The first two summers of college, he worked in construction units. The workers used to call him “Harvey” due to his college affiliation, Cavallaro remembers.
“For me, it was an interesting and worthwhile experience living and working with folks who were not going to Harvard College,” he says. “To have a thicker sense of the world—it’s something.”
Cavallaro’s passion for social justice was more than apparent even in his college years. He  went to study groups at the Institute of Politics and participated in a mentoring program, and his coursework included classes on crime and social psychology. But while he was focused on domestic issues, his future wife was experiencing the chaos of international politics firsthand.
A TURBULENT BEGINNING
Before she even celebrated her first birthday, Marques was forced to separate from her mother and flee her birthplace in northeastern Brazil. When Marques was only nine months old, her father was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered by the brutal military regime that had taken over the country in a coup d’état nearly a decade earlier.
The terrified refugees separated and tried to escape the country. Marques’ mother fled to Chile, and a family friend took charge of the infant Marques. The child and her mother reunited in Chile, believing they had found their safe haven, but their hopes were dashed only a few days later when a military coup overthrew democratically-elected president Salvador Allende and elevated General Augusto Pinochet to power in 1973.
Over the next nine years, Marques and her mother would journey across Cuba, Sweden, Russia, and Panama to find a home before returning to Brazil, where Marques and her mother finally settled down for the first time in Marques’ memory.
A Spanish speaker from her time in Chile and Cuba, Marques initially  struggled to learn Portuguese and devoted most of her time to her studies. In high school, she earned a scholarship enabling her to attend the United World College in New Mexico, where she learned English from scratch.
After high school, Marques studied economics and held a part-time job teaching English in Brazil, where she first encountered Cavallaro.
AN ACTIVIST IS BORN
Leaving the Harvard bubble would open Cavallaro’s sights internationally—but first, he would begin at home.
Working for Mass. Representative Edward J. Markey while bartending at night, Cavallaro became increasingly interested in the causes and consequences of U.S. policy toward Central and South America. His newfound focus led him to the Annunciation House, a facility that helps poor migrants and political refugees along the U.S.-Mexico border. Provided with room, board, and a small stipend, Cavallaro worked with Central American refugees on asylum cases, leading him to become interested in using law to further human rights.
“For reasons beyond anything we can control, some people are less fortunate than others, but we have social structures that cause inequalities and we should work to empower those who are excluded,” Cavallaro says. “I started out wanting to do that domestically, and then as I became more informed about situations of injustice internationally, I became more involved.”
Cavallaro attended Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, but he did not stay long. An opportunity came by for him to work for human rights organizations in Chile.
At the time, Chile was embroiled in an election where voters were to decide whether to grant Pinochet another eight years in office. Cavallaro regularly attended anti-Pinochet rallies, facing the wrath of police water cannons and once even being detained and threatened with immediate deportation.
On Oct. 5, 1988, Cavallaro witnessed history when 56 percent of the country voted against Pinochet. He then remained in Chile through March 1990 during the inauguration of the first democratically-elected president in more than a decade.
He returned to law school, earned his degree, and returned to his pursuit of international justice. This time, he worked for Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C., eventually winning a grant to open offices for the organization and another NGO.
THE PAIR UNITES
After meeting Cavallaro, Marques began to volunteer for Human Rights Watch, where she became friends with many journalists, including a Washington Post chief based in Buenos Aires who offered her the unique opportunity to travel throughout South America and cover the ongoing political and economic developments there. Eventually, Marques became a special correspondent for the Post.
“Journalism is fascinating,” Marques says. “I’m a very curious person. I want to find out the truth.”
Marques worked with her husband to found a Brazilian human rights organization called Global Justice Center. Cavallaro headed the organization for several years before the couple would relocate to Cambridge, where Cavallaro began his work as associate director of the HLS Human Rights Program. Marques, though, travelled between Angola and Cambridge several times a year for Human Rights Watch to conduct research on freedom of speech and on resettlement issues.
Cavallaro teaches several classes on human rights and oversees projects that take him and his students abroad to investigate human rights abuses.
“At any given time, you’ll see Jim in Guatemala vetting work for Panama, translating work and also coordinating things in Boston,” says Claret M. Vargas ’96, a third-year Law School student and co-president of HLS Advocates for Human Rights. “He has boundless energy and yet never makes you feel guilty in terms of how much work he does.”
While Cavallaro ran the Human Rights Program, Marques wrote a memoir. The goal, she says, was to preserve the stories of her mother and grandmother for the day when her daughter Mara would be able to understand the memories.
“Mara is at an age where she starts asking questions. She’s too young to understand some things, but I’d like to answer her questions,” Marques says. “And then I decided that before I forget, before it’s too late, before I don’t have the energy, I wanted to write.”
“Born Subversive: A Memoir of Survival,” was published in April 2008. It is currently being adapted into a play. Now, Marques spends her time as a research coordinator at the Harvard School of Public Health working on a global health initiative project.
MASTERS OF THE HOUSE
The pair live only a few blocks from Harvard Yard in a cozy home that they meticulously redecorated themselves. Every small detail is loaded with meaning, from the African masks hanging on the walls to the music playing in the background, “Obrigado Brazil” played by cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76.
But before the next academic year, the two will pack up their belongings, rent out their house, and move back to where Cavallaro lived over 20 years ago—the Radcliffe Quad.
Along with their luggage, they will also bring their passion for bettering the world to Currier House. Indeed, the pair says they are most excited to advise undergraduates as they make major life decisions. But not everyone in the family shares the same priorities.
“My daughter’s most excited about the soft-serve ice cream,” Cavallaro says of their nine-year-old daughter Mara.
Vargas can vouch for the pair’s ability to connect with students. The couple regularly invites HLS students over to their house to watch human rights movies as they snack on food, courtesy of the couple.
For a breakfast meeting at 8 a.m. at the pair’s house, Cavallaro brought the students danishes and even offered to make them scrambled eggs, according to Vargas, a former Currier House resident.
“He’s basically the reason I went to Harvard Law School,” Vargas says. “The amount of enthusiasm and dedication to the Human Rights Program—there’s no comparison in terms of other programs and other directors.”
And Cavallaro says that becoming interim House Master might even help develop a renewed vigor for his work.
“At some level, I just find that being around students recharges my batteries,” he says. “There’s an enormous energy, idealism, and capacity that students bring to their work. I feel that energy, and it moves me as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams took home six wins and bragging rights, battling Brandeis, Boston College, and MIT in Boston and taking home the third annual Beanpot.
The Crimson fencing squads (9-6M, 11-6W) faced off against all three other Boston-area schools in a one-night marathon-style tournament. Harvard took home the two titles with some ease, as the men’s team defeated the Judges, the Engineers, and the Eagles with scores of 23-4, 19-8, and 19-8, respectively, while the women won all three matches as well, 20-7, 21-6, 19-8.
“I though [the Beanpot] went very well,” co-captain Karl Harmenberg said. “We shut [Brandeis] down completely this time. [The others we] expect to beat, but even bad teams are dangerous.”
“It was a good night for us obviously,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “I was very happy to see the men’s foil squad performing better than they had last time [out].
Harvard performed impressively all-around, dominating its three opponents in the epee, sabre, and foil competitions. Sophomore co-captain epee Noam Mills and freshman sabre Thomas Kolasa, on the women’s and men’s sides respectively, led the Crimson with strong individual efforts, each going a perfect 9-0 on the night.
This is especially impressive, considering that each Harvard fencer played three back-to-back matches last night.
“The freshmen and sophomores are really growing into their roles and winning bouts,” Harmening said.
Junior epee Wesley Talcott also came up big for the Crimson, winning key bouts against Boston College.
The leading fencers for MIT were sophomore foils Ben Nield and Daniel Levine, who finished the night 7-2 and 5-4 respectively. Having bouts of difficulty on the Engineers’ side were sabres senior Rajiv Nadadur (3-6), sophomore Vinayak Ramesh (2-7), and junior Max Brand (1-8).
The Beanpot holds special significance for Harvard, which emerged victorious from last year’s inaugural tournament as well.
“[The fencing Beanpot] is something that started a few years ago,” Brand said. “It’s a new tradition, an excellent tournament. This year we were obviously very strong but, with Brandeis especially, in any given year, [anything can happen].”
The rivalry between the Crimson and the Judges is especially strong. While Harvard took home last years’ Beanpot matchup against Brandeis, the Judges defeated the Crimson two years ago in another battle.
“Every year it’s a new experience,” Brand said. “You never really know [who’s going to come out on top].”
Interestingly, Brand’s son, senior sabre Alex Brand, competes on the Brandeis men’s squad, contributing yet another element to the Beanpot rivalry between Harvard and the Judges.
Excited about coming away with two tournament titles again this year, Coach Brand emphasized that his teams see the Beanpot as both a very important tournament in itself and a way to prepare for the Crimson’s upcoming matches.
“We win a trophy and that’s exciting. In a sense we want to show that we’re better than all the teams in Boston,” Harmening said. “Our big goal is to win Ivies and NCAAs, but [the Beanpot is] not a practice tournament; we want to win.”
Winning appears to be both a dominant theme and a trend for Harvard, which has won eight of its last ten matchups, including four out of six matches at the first part of the Ivy League Championships that took place last weekend at Cornell.
The Crimson men’s team is currently in a three-way tie for second place in the Ivy League with Brown and Yale, while the women’s team sits in fourth place. The Harvard women are the defending Ivy League champions, while Penn will attempt to earn its second Ivy title on the men’s side. The teams are looking forward to next weekend, when it resumes its quest for the Ivy League crown in part two of the Ivy Championships at Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off an undefeated season, no women’s squash program this year better epitomizes success than the Harvard women’s squash team.
The Crimson (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) has capped off its string of skillfully maneuvered victories with its 17th Ivy League title and 11th Barhite Award, given annually for the best dual match record in the nation.
Because of its strong performance, Harvard enters the CSA National Team Championships seeded No. 1. This weekend, the Crimson and seven other elite teams—Trinity, Penn, Princeton, Yale, Cornell, Stanford, and Williams—will be playing for the Howe Cup at Yale’s Brady Squash Center.
Coming into the tournament, Harvard is well-equipped to succeed. In its regular season, the Crimson did not drop a single game at the No. 1, 5, 7, 8, or 9 positions, boasting undefeated records as well 10 of the team’s 15 players—an undeniably impressive feat.
But Harvard is careful to stay focused and not let the hype affect the team.
“We’re going in as the number one seed, but by no means are we complacent in that position,” co-captain Johanna Snyder said. “The other teams are going to be ready to beat us and we respect that.”
Despite a two-week break since its last match, the Crimson has been working consistently to prepare for the championship.
“[We’ve been working on] positivity, confidence, and sharpening our skills,” co-captain Katherine O’Donnell said. “We want to remember that squash is fun and it’s what we’ve loved to do for so many years. It will make the tension-filled weekend a culmination of our hard work.”
On Friday, Harvard begins its quest for the national championship with a match against No. 8 Williams College.
Early on in the season, the Crimson faced the Ephs and soundly defeated them, 9-0. In a powerhouse display, each of the Harvard athletes won in consecutive games.
But Williams has had the majority of its season to improve following the loss to the Crimson. The Ephs put on a very strong showing in the final leg of the season, blanking four of their last five opponents.
Undoubtedly, this momentum will help carry Williams into the match.
Playing in the No. 1 position for Harvard will be freshman Laura Gemmell, already notorious in her rookie season for her unparalleled skill. During the season, the rookie compiled an impressive 8-0 record, defeating each of her opponents in straight games.
Filling the No. 2, 3, and 4 positions are sophomore Nirasha Guruge and juniors June Tiong and Alisha Mashruwala, respectively.
Freshman Natasha Kingshott will carry her regular season play in the No. 5 position into the tournament. The rookie has a 9-0 individual record with eight of her victories at the No. 5 spot.
Nearing the conclusion of their collegiate squash careers, Snyder and O’Donnell will be playing in the No. 6 and No. 8 spots.
O’Donnell alluded to the different layers of emotion surrounding the looming end.
“It’s bittersweet. This is the perfect way to end—number one going into nationals,” she said. “But, it’s definitely sad.”
For Snyder, the championship has arrived at just the right time.
“I’m really psyched that I’m peaking at the end of my college career,” she said. “That feels really good because I’ve trained really hard and it’s nice to have it pay off. I’m playing my best squash and I hope that it comes through this weekend.”
Rounding out the lineup will be sophomore Cece Cortes, junior Bethan Williams, and freshman Sarah Mumanachit.
They will play at No. 7, 8, and 10, respectively.
If the Crimson emerges victorious from its match on Friday, it will play the winner of the match between No. 4 Yale and No. 5 Princeton.
Harvard would assuredly love to get another shot to face the Tigers. In two of the last three years, the Crimson has lost the championship match to its fellow Ancient Eight rival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Basketball standout Victoria Lippert has a rather surprising item to notch on to her growing lists of accomplishments: a black belt in taekwondo. The freshman admits to trying a number of sports growing up before finally getting serious about basketball in high school. But for the Harvard women’s basketball team, her choice to pick up the ball rather than keep the belt was a blessing.
“We’re thrilled with Victoria,” says head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “She’s talented and more versatile than we thought she would be this early in the year.”
A native of San Diego, Lippert has been a dominant factor in the Crimson’s ongoing winning season. Lippert, who has been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week three times so far this season, is currently the second leading scorer on the team with 12.3 points per game. Last weekend, in conference games against Cornell and Columbia, the guard/forward racked up a total of 48 points, leading all scorers and attaining a personal best of 28 points against the Lions.
Much of Lippert’s success on the court comes from an unparalleled and determined work ethic in practice.
“You always hope to have a team full of workers like Victoria,” Delaney-Smith says. “She’s the hardest worker I’ve ever coached and constantly works to get better.”
“She inspires her teammates, and, as you can see, her work in practice is paying off,” sophomore Brogan Berry echoes.
With the help of Lippert, Harvard is currently on a five-game winning streak, its longest over the past two seasons. As a result, the Crimson has a shot at the Ivy title and the chance for a bid in a postseason tournament once the season has concluded.
“[Victoria’s] one of the people responsible for us staying in the race,” Delaney-Smith says. “We’re going to a tournament, hopefully the NCAA, and she’s been an integral part to that endeavor.”
Lippert’s command on the court has much to do with a quality her coach already pointed out: versatility.
“[Victoria’s] not a one dimensional player,” Delaney-Smith explains. “She can pull up or post up, she can drive hard to the basket, or she can shoot the three.”
With this deadly offensive combination, Lippert has been a threat to a number of the opponents Harvard has faced. But do not expect the freshman to develop a big head in the wake of her accomplishments in the game. If anything, the young star remains humble and appreciative of her teammates and coaches.
“It’s just a joy being able to play with my teammates on the court,” Lippert says. “I’m very blessed to have these opportunities and to be put in situations where I am able to succeed.”
Referring to her “incredible support system” as a main contributor to her success, Lippert may be a strong individual player, but always recognizes herself first as the member of a team.
Despite the achievements she has already accomplished so far, the humble rookie acknowledges the area of her game that needs improvement.
“The coaches have really focused on working with me on my defense,” Lippert admits. “I’ve been working to pick up my game on the defensive area.”
“[Victoria] needs to work on her defense and gain consistency with her rebounding,” Delaney-Smith adds. “But we’re pleased with where she is and she continues to get better and better everyday.”
With her impressive level of play, it is easy to forget that Lippert is only a freshman, still making the difficult transition from high school to Division I basketball. But in a new environment where new players are easily intimidated, Lippert has flourished.
“The [Division I] level is different from high school, but I love competing and I thrive in competitive environments,” Lippert says.
“She’s a great player, whatever age she is,” Brogan attests. “She may be a freshman, but she does not play like one at all.”
With five games remaining in the regular season, Lippert and her teammates will all have to step up their games to finish strong in conference play and notch wins in the postseason.
“We definitely want to get revenge against Princeton and Dartmouth,” Lippert says. “Everyone wants to beat us, but we just have to take care of ourselves at this point.”
Whatever the fate of this season’s Crimson team may be though, Lippert will remain an integral part in the years to come and will likely mature even further in her game.
“She’s going to be a great player in the future,” Brogan predicts. “She’ll do great things here.”
For now, Lippert is taking her first season, her success, and her future day-by-day.
“I have high expectations for what I do on the court and in life,” Lippert says. “I just try to push myself to be the best I can each and every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three members of the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team were honored on All-ECAC teams, the league office announced this afternoon.
Junior forward Kate Buesser, junior defenseman Leanna Coskren, and freshman forward Jillian Dempsey all earned recognition for their efforts in conference play this season.
Buesser headlines the group, as she earned a spot on the conference first team. The winger was second in the league in scoring, tallying 32 points in 22 ECAC games. Buesser leads the Crimson with 35 total points this season on 13 goals and 22 assists, and she is tops in the conference with a +22 rating for the season. The junior was named a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award last week.
Coskren, a third-team selection, is also a Kazmaier finalist. The blueliner has 17 points on the season, including six goals. She is 18th in the nation amongst defenseman with 0.59 points per contest and anchors Harvard’s third-ranked defense.
Dempsey earned a spot on the conference’s All-Rookie squad after a season in which she ranked eighth nationally among freshmen with 0.79 points per game. Dempsey is second on the Crimson with 23 points this season on 10 goals and 13 assists.
In additional news from the ECAC office, senior Randi Griffin, the reigning conference player of the week, is a nominee for the ECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year award. Griffin scored four goals over the weekend, including her first career hat trick.
Harvard earned the No. 3 seed in the conference tournament, which begins this weekend. The Crimson hosts sixth-seeded Princeton in a best-of-three series beginning Friday night. The puck drops at 7 pm at Bright Hockey Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If one theme has characterized recent Harvard wrestling history, it has been individual success overshadowed by constant injuries that stifle team performance. Watching grappler after grappler go down can undoubtedly be frustrating, but co-captain J.P. O’Connor vented his frustration at a different source over the weekend, suggesting that the problem may not be how many guys go down, but rather how few there are to replace them.
After finishing the dual season a disappointing 2-14-1 with lopsided losses to No. 6 Cornell (44-6) and Columbia (30-15) last Friday and Saturday, O’Connor reflected on the difficulty of keeping pace in the Ivy League.
“When you’re sending out guys who aren’t necessarily your No. 1 guy, it’s tough to be competitive,” O’Connor said. “It’s kind of been a trend since I’ve been here. We don’t have the depth that other schools have. We need a little more backing, by which I mean admissions backing, to be a competitive program in the dual season.”
O’Connor—not often one to mince words—did not hold back here in his implication that the Crimson wrestling team suffers from the school’s stringent standards. Of course, holding talented applicants to rigorous academic standards is nothing new at Harvard, and it goes without saying that Crimson athletics would improve with more relaxed admissions cutoffs. Still, O’Connor’s remarks serve as a reminder that often the small sports are hit hardest, when each rejected potential team member represents significant depth lost from the roster.
Nonetheless, O’Connor and co-captain Louis Caputo make the situation seem far from hopeless. Regardless of the impact that “admissions backing” has on the team’s performance, clearly two of its stars could compete for any wrestling program in the country. As O’Connor (157 lbs.) and Caputo (184) stand at No. 1 and No. 6 in their respective weight classes, Harvard can look forward to two legitimate runs at the national title in March.

What do overpriced Chinese food, expensive liquor stores, and George Daugherty, our familiar Spare Change newspaper vendor, have in common? They all find Cambridge to be a profitable spot for business. Renowned for being home to two of the most prestigious universities in the world, Cambridge can now also boast of being the 21st richest urban area in America.
Using U.S. Census data from 2008, Portfolio.com surveyed the nation’s 420 biggest cities with populations above 75,000 and ranked their relative wealth based mostly on income and real estate prices. Cambridge came out as the 21st wealthiest center, with a per capita income of $47,938, almost twice the national average of $27,589. And how expensive exactly is a house in Cambridge? With the median price of homes hitting about $579,700, Cambridge is also the third most expensive city in the Northeast region.
The rest of America may still be recovering from the real estate bubble, but here in Cambridge, it looks like prices are still sky-high.

Losing hockey teams, frigid weather, Bieber Fever. Even before the Olympics, we thought that Canada needed help. Well, we hope for the sake of our North American neighbor that help doesn’t come through the World Wide Web.
According to a new study conducted by Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society, Canada has some of the slowest and most expensive Internet services in the world.
However, according to a report released by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission last year, Canada was a broadband leader based on the benchmark of penetration per 100 inhabitants, which indicates how many people have access to high-speed internet in their homes.
Although this isn’t unlike the usual Canadian perception of themselves (Canada also sees itself as a high performer in hockey, and we all know how that turned out), the Berkman Center for Internet & Society has said otherwise.
According to the Berkman report, "Canada continues to see itself as a high performer in broadband, as it was early in the decade, but current benchmarks suggest that this is no longer a realistic picture of its comparative performance on several relevant measures."
Overall, Canada was ranked 19th worldwide, trailing the United States and the overall leaders—Sweden, Denmark and Japan.

Tiger Woods' very public apology has tongues wagging about his future value as a sports figure, including that of Stephen A. Greyser '56, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School.
Greyser spoke to New England Cable News last Friday, after Woods expressed regret for his transgressions in a 15-minute televised apology.
"How far does it go? It doesn't go very far," Greyser said in the interview. "At least in my opinion."
Woods' future seems dreary as—according to the Davie-Brown Index, a measure of a celebrity's influence on brands and consumers—his standing among the general public has dramatically decreased. Woods was ranked as number 6 last year, but he has since plummeted to number 24.
So what's Tiger to do? What he does best, said Greyser. Play golf and win.
"That's what builds his brand and that has the potential to bring it back, but that's no guarantee," he said.
