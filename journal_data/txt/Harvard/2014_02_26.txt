Swedish trip-hop outfit Little Dragon return with a single both primal and modern—“Klapp Klapp,” off their upcoming album “Nabuma Rubberband,” layers heavily compressed bass over the insistent thump of raw, tribal-sounding drums. Though the band claims that their upcoming album is influenced by the “Janet Jackson slow jams [frontwoman Yukimi Nagano] used to listen to wandering around Gothenburg during the unrelenting winter,” “Klapp Klapp” is stubbornly upbeat, peppered with trills of synth and framed around a chant-like, infectious chorus: “Falling apart, apart, apart, apart, apart.”
 
But some of the song’s appeal is lost as Little Dragon struggle to convey the verbal aspect of their message to listeners. The lyrics of “Klapp Klapp” are stilted and occasionally nonsensical—Nagano’s breathy, stratospheric vocals are forgotten in the attempt to decipher lines like “Falling through the floor on my broken butterfly wing / Gimme one more, the girl from the corridor sing / She sing.”
 
Regardless, “Klapp Klapp” melds the experimental and the familiar into a track that is oddly accessible despite pushing at the established boundaries of pop and electronica. It’s evident that Little Dragon know who they are and where they want to go with their music—it’s simply a matter of crossing the lyrical speed bumps that stand between them and their destination.
 
“Nabuma Rubberband” is out on May 13 via Loma Vista Recordings in the United States.

Just seconds into her fourth album as St. Vincent, Annie Clark walks out into the desert and takes off her clothes. “Sweatin’, sweatin’ / No one will ever find me,” she sings over the glitchy synths and filtered guitars of the opening track, “Rattlesnake.” Clark knows quite well this is a false isolation; she’s leading you by the hand out to that same desert where she allegedly did, indeed, strip down and bask in the sun—at least until a real serpent chased her, naked, all the way home.
 
The new St. Vincent album, her self-titled major label debut, won’t tell you an awful lot about who Annie Clark is. It’s a far cry from the lush chamber pop of her early days—more raw-sounding, groove-based. And while sometimes intimate, it’s just strange and creepy enough to keep you from getting too close. Even so, it’s possibly Clark’s most fully realized musical self-portrait yet. There’s a sense that everything’s unfettered here—her dark and crazy side, her roaring guitar chops, her desire to simply have fun—and at the same time, the album never loses the cleverness and meticulous songwriting that has made St. Vincent so compelling throughout her seven-year solo career.
 
Much of Clark’s music explores the intrinsic beauty of darkness and rage. For the first half of “Huey Newton,” she guides us through one of the most enthralling lyrical landscapes she’s painted, an Ambien-induced digital dream world populated by “cowboys of information” and “blind psychics / turned online assassins.” It’s not a comfortable listen; Clark’s gentle vocals clash with sustained dissonant synths, a lone synth line looped ad nauseam in the background only adding to the haunted aesthetic. When the clouds finally part, Clark’s voice soaring over shimmering major chords, it seems that the spell has finally reached full power, until suddenly, without warning, this heavenly climax is interrupted by a thundering guitar riff. For the rest of the song, now a swaggering rock jam, Clark ditches the smooth crooning and conjures up a millennial facsimile of Robert Plant, theatrically depicting “a shrine / of zeroes and ones” over fuzzy blues licks and wavering vocal pads. 
Fascination—and disgust—with the technologically saturated world is not unique to the “zeroes and ones” of “Huey Newton.” On “Digital Witness,” Clark rails against living life through a computer screen, backed up, appropriately enough, by a punchy synth sax section. Where it could have been preachy, the song is instead amusingly sardonic; Clark relishes the role of digital overlord, feistily declaring, “I want all of your mind.”
 
Perhaps in line with her skepticism of technology, the album deviates most from Clark’s previous work through its visceral liveliness. More than any of her other albums, even the guitar-and-synth-heavy “Strange Mercy,” “St. Vincent” is charged with electrical energy and driven by idiosyncratic dance beats. Dap-Kings drummer Homer Steinweiss, a new addition to the St. Vincent crew, is a major player here: lead single “Birth In Reverse” builds its complex guitar work up from a pounding bass drum, while “Bring Me Your Loves” is a New Orleans second-line march made delightfully demonic. It’s not hard to hear the influence of Clark’s recent collaborator David Byrne in the groovy freakiness of it all, but structurally and melodically, these are St. Vincent songs through and through.
 
Yet as hard as it is to find fault with an album so loaded with invention, there’s a lingering sense that something has been lost since the days of Clark’s early work. Back on her 2007 debut, “Marry Me,” Clark, fresh off tours with Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree, made music that dripped with heart, imbued with a beauty that felt jarringly real. She was never just another cute singer-songwriter, which made her sometimes-grave, sometimes-frightening songs feel worthy of their silky, woodwind-heavy orchestration. The crackling electricity of “St. Vincent” may be infectious, but will we ever again see the Annie Clark who played intimate duets with Andrew Bird and Justin Vernon, who took her guitar out into the streets of Paris and sighed her way through songs on a park railing?
 
It’s probably time to get used to the new St. Vincent, a silver-haired goddess who stares icily from her pink plastic throne on her album cover. But just when you least expect a vulnerable moment from her, Clark hits you with something like “Severed Crossed Fingers,” the unabashedly sentimental power ballad that closes the album with chiming harpsichord arpeggios and rich choral accents.
 “You stole the heart right out of my chest,” she sings, reaffirming her naked humanity even as rubble and the guts of sundered bodies lie strewn around her. And it’s at this moment, seeing her clearly through the smoke, that you realize you’ll never stop loving Annie Clark. Not if it’s the scariest thing in the world.

UPDATED: Feb. 25, 2013, at 11 p.m.
Three naïve teenagers, a tormented young man, and the boredom of suburban life come together to catastrophic effect in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Smoking Lesson” by Julia Jordan, which runs from Feb. 21 to March 1. The result is a contemplative, thought-provoking production that resonates due to the great cast and creative usage of the set.
 
The play touches upon numerous social problems, including unemployment and mental disability, but its greatest strength lies in its effective depiction of the self-destructive side of teenage boredom. Tare (Julianna N. Sass ’17), Mary Kate (Alexandra M. Kiley ’15), and Lisa Ann (Alice Abracen ’15) are 15-year-olds growing up somewhere along the banks of the Mississippi. Haunted by the memory of their friend, Pearl, an older girl who committed suicide, they gather every year to commemorate her death. It is unclear whether they put on the ceremony for Pearl’s own sake or simply for a moment of relief from the stifling closeness of adolescence. It is that desire for release, excitement, and a little danger which eventually draws the characters into a tempestuous, emotionally charged relationship with the town layabout, Tom (Archie I.H. Stonehill '17).
 The pathos of the storyline is perhaps best conveyed by Sass, who does an outstanding job as the fate-tempting, thrill-seeking Tare, the ringleader of the three girls. Sass can and does switch from humorous to angry to heartbroken in an instant without seeming false or overly scripted; her performance draws the audience into Tare’s world. In one scene, Mark Kate and Lisa Ann accuse Tare of deserting them in order to be with Tom. The fight appears seemingly out of nowhere and  is gone just as quickly; Sass accomplishes the rapid emotional shifts from hurt to defensive to apologetic superbly, making Tare a sympathetic character even in her most self-centered or reckless moments.
Her counterpart in the play is Tom, a 20-something delinquent mysteriously connected to Pearl’s death. Although slightly less relatable than Sass, Stonehill also does an excellent job conveying the complexity and emotional turmoil of his character. Held back by crippling grief and self-blame, Tom vacillates between kindness and violence. Stonehill adeptly handles these transitions, especially as the relationship between his character and Tare becomes more explosive. At one point in the production, Tom carefully keeps watch over a sleeping Tare; in the next scene, he throws her to the ground and threatens her. Throughout the play, Stonehill is completely believable; Tom’s anger, when it comes, is forceful and intimidating, yet Stonehill succeeds in showing the pain lying beneath Tom’s stormy exterior.
The play manages to thrive in a minimalist set design. Props are few and far between with the exception of a seemingly endless array of fake cigarettes. Otherwise, a rope swing, a few crates, and a wooden bridge support are the only scenery. The fact that the entire play takes place in a single location makes this easier, but the creativity with which director Lelaina E. Vogel ’15 incorporates the props into the actors’ movements allows the play to shine. Nothing is superfluous: each piece of scenery is meaningful and ultimately essential to the play’s forward motion. The play steadily picks up speed until the last few scenes, which are a whirlwind of intensity and raw emotion.
However, the play does encounter some of the issues typical of a black-box production. The intimacy of the Loeb Ex occasionally works against the play; the beginning feels somewhat stilted and the actors appear much more self-conscious in the first few scenes, particularly that of Pearl’s memorial. The actors speak directly to the audience, foregoing a connection with other actors  on the stage yet failing to relate to the viewers.
These are only details, though; “Smoking Lesson” is both poignant and effective. In the space of only an hour, it delivers a profoundly personal rendering of the ways in which grief and the claustrophobia of adolescence can permanently mark lives. Sass, Kiley, and Abracen are convincing as girls driven not only by the loss of a friend but also by the all-encompassing, suffocating boredom so familiar to most teenagers. After the play has reached its shocking, heartbreaking denouement, Sass utters her last lines: “I’ve never been anywhere! We never do anything!” Long after the words stop echoing, the sensation of desolation and loneliness lingers, proving that “Smoking Lesson” is an emotional punch to the gut.

 “Everybody always says, 'Be humble. Be humble.' When the last time somebody told you to be great, be amazing, be awesome? Be awesome!" —Kanye West

Richard Sherman just won the Super Bowl with the Seattle Seahawks, but his legacy from this past NFL postseason will almost certainly be his epic 30-second interview with Erin Andrews following his team’s National Football Conference championship game victory over the San Francisco 49ers. After Andrews asked him to take her through the final play of the game, Sherman spared no words: "I’m the best corner in the game! When you try me with a sorry receiver like [Michael] Crabtree, that’s the result you’re going to get!"
Sherman’s comments sparked a national debate. Some argued that his comments were completely inappropriate, rude, and unnecessary. Others argued that he was simply caught up in the excitement and intensity of the game and that his comments were excusable. Fewer people argued, however, that his comments were completely justified, backed by both his dominant performance in the game and his remarkable career.
I watched Sherman’s interview shocked like the rest of America, not knowing at first what to think. Not only was it probably the most fascinating 30-second interview I’ve witnessed, but it also oozed confidence, pride, and hard-earned satisfaction not normally seen in post-game interviews. It instantly reminded me of the adjacent words spoken by my favorite rapper and self-proclaimed god, Kanye West.
Now, justifying Sherman’s raw, biting interview by likening him to Kanye’s equally controversial character may not seem like appropriate justification at all. In truth, many Kanye fans don’t like to pay attention to his personality—they’d rather just focus on his music. Kanye West is undeniably one of the, if not the single, most commercially and critically acclaimed artists of the past decade. After gaining success as a hip-hop producer in the early 2000s, Kanye has released six solo albums, all of which have received huge critical praise and sold at least one million copies. He has also released an album and toured with Jay-Z, signed a clothing deal with Adidas, and given a speech (lecture? rant?) at the Graduate School of Design this past fall. For most of his fans, these accomplishments are enough to offset his sometimes off-putting personality.
For better or worse, I have a much harder time separating his personality from his music and other achievements. As is true with many hyper-successful athletes and artists, Kanye’s pride, which often manifests itself as egotism and vanity, is a huge part of what makes his music so great. His confidence is certainly what led him to believe that he could rap when music labels told him he would never succeed. Further, his unflinching self-assurance allows him to take huge, unrivaled musical risks on his albums. Indeed, it is largely due to his confidence and—in popular terms—ego that Kanye West is Kanye West.
The same is true with Richard Sherman. After his team’s victory and his ensuing interview, Sherman was both chastised for his brash, egotistical personality and praised for his athletic performance. Yet his personality and performance are undeniably linked. Sherman’s confidence likely allows him to be the spectacular, Pro Bowl football player he is. And it is likely this same pride that allowed Sherman to dominate the NFC championship game, setting up the final interception that carried the Seahawks to victory. Without his exceptional level of confidence in his abilities, Sherman may never have even made it to the NFL.
That’s not to say humility is wrong or useless, or to say that everyone should go around declaring "I am a God"(even if I sing this to myself every morning in the shower). But when celebrities like Kanye or Sherman forgo their politically correct, media-savvy filters to reveal their true confidence and pride, less of the national conversation should be on about muting them. We should instead acknowledge and even celebrate their confidence for driving them to be among the greatest at their respective crafts. By celebrating hard work and confidence, the true message of Kanye and Sherman—to fundamentally believe in yourself—will shine above the petty discourse about what is and isn’t appropriate to say.
Plus, I could use a couple more Taylor Swift interruptions to spice up my life. Thanks for letting me finish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
When "Nixon in China" premiered in 1987, it got mixed reviews. Some critics thought it was too bland; others thought it was too fluffy. And above all, the subject matter was strange. Whereas many operas are inspired by Greek mythology or exotic romances, this opera takes its cues from the newsreel, focusing on Nixon’s ground-breaking 1972 visit to Beijing and the beginning of America’s rapprochement with China. Having a man as controversial as Nixon for a hero only made the opera more complicated. Was it a satire? Were we supposed to take it seriously? Or worse yet, did the opera take itself so seriously that it became a caricature by accident?
In the opening act, bright saxophones and brasses brand Nixon with the big band sounds of the 1970s. "News has a kind of mystery," he sings. And perhaps a little too earnestly, "I know America is good at heart. An old cold warrior / Piloting towards an unknown shore." But there are other moments when he comes across as neither idealistic nor cynical, but just eerily aware of his own human limitations. "We live in an unsettled time," the president sings. "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?"
Composer John Adams gives us Nixon as a visionary with very human doubts, but does he do the same for Nixon’s counterparts, Chairman Mao Tse-tung and his wife? For an audience looking for a nuanced portrayal, they prove to be a little more problematic. The Chairman is cast as a walking ideological system who both inhabits the big character posters of the Cultural Revolution and controls the Orwellian China of the American imagination. Madame Mao is a power-hungry Lady Macbeth, whose shrieking aria "I am the wife of Mao Tse-tung" is packed with dissonant tritones and self-glorifying slogans.
"Nixon in China" may be about a ground-breaking contact between two warring cultures, but it is told through the eyes and pathos of the American adventurer Nixon, not the Chinese Mao. In the course of the opera, Nixon’s complexity makes him more than just a stand-in for an ideology. Even as Mao and Madame Mao are given the same space for private doubts, they never quite become independent from their political personas. John Adams claims he gave Madame Mao "her private fantasies, her erotic desires, and even a certain tragic awareness," but even these moments aren’t free of their orientalizing tendencies. They are reminiscent of the West’s troubling news coverage of Cixi, the hapless Qing empress who was painted by journalists as both a reactionary politician and an object of erotic fantasy.
In this way, Mao and Madame Mao are not just reduced into political cartoons; they embody the same myths that Americans had already come to expect from media outlets like CNN. Their flattening out tells us just as much about the spirit of the moment as do the nuances we see in Nixon. "Opera in itself is a media event," says Adams in an interview with the Metropolitan Opera. "Only the media involved are the orchestra and the voice and what goes on stage. So this is a media event about a media event."
For those of us who remember Bush better than Nixon and Syria better than the Soviet Union, watching an opera that treats Nixon’s visit like a real-time television headline may feel a bit strange. To the modern viewer, that event is history, not news. But for composer John Adams, I suspect that writing "Nixon in China" was meaningful precisely because he had people like us in mind. He didn’t want to write a satire because that would minimize the characters to mere political cartoons. But he also couldn’t write an epic, as that would just make a hero out of Nixon and a villain out of Mao. His desire to avoid these genres does not, however, mean that he was trying to give us the real versions of these characters, or that he was even interested in finding the "real" in them at all. For John Adams, the appeal of the characters was not their interior being, but rather their exterior selves as captured and imagined by the media.
"I think Americans have forgotten what a dark, looming menace China was portrayed to be," Adams reminds us in an interview with the Metropolitan Opera. "Today China is this strangely schizophrenic society, a hectic capitalist economy with an almost uncontrollable urge to develop." If "Nixon in China" had been written today, the story and the cast of characters would be radically different. China has become so much more like America, and America is now so much more like China. The caricatures would have been impossible, in part because the way the media reaches audiences has evolved. Because of its evolution, it’s much more difficult for the media to speak with a unified voice. Gone are the Cultural Revolution loudspeakers and the American living room televisions, to be replaced by Weibo and Facebook and QQ and Twitter. So while we might look back at a CNN opera like "Nixon in China", we should expect an Instagram oratorio for the future.

Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “In the Dark,” an original play both written and directed by Matt S. Krane ’15 that ran from Feb. 21 to 23 in the Adams Pool Theater, left the audience mostly uninformed regarding the cryptic circumstances of its protagonists, siblings Eve (Taylor K. Phillips ’15) and Zade (Matthew J. Bialo ’15). The ambiguity of the play’s exposition created an atmosphere that was uneasy, overwhelming, and intimate; while the script, generic in parts, could have deflated under the weight of its own artistic ambition, the strong cast and the lighting prevented it from doing so.
 
The play begins with Eve and Zade as they run away from their father through the forest after an unknown horror is committed. A mysterious figure, M. (Teis D. Jorgensen ’14), awaits them. Caught between impossible choices, the pair must keep themselves safe and hope that they can find their way out alive.
 
The primary issue with the play lies in the characterization in the script: the relationship between Eve and Zade—the crux of the play—is unbalanced. Zade’s mature, nuanced persona clashes with Eve’s constant immaturity, and his continued loyalty to his sister seems illogically suicidal, though noble. Her refrain of “I’m afraid” while she antagonizes Zade about everything from the number of matches left to whether they will actually make it back to civilization becomes unbearable. Eve is belligerent and impulsive without any redeeming qualities, thwarting any opportunity for sympathy.
 
Because Eve clearly grates on Zade’s nerves, the siblings’ later romantic relationship is highly unlikely and without warning.  Eve’s limited characterization became even less believable when the siblings first kiss; it seems odd because one character is three-dimensional and the other is a cartoon. What might have been a central element in the play—this sibling tryst—is instead quickly forgotten because it seems so illogical and insignificant.
 
Despite this, Bialo was superb as Zade who is portrayed as a bomb with a lit fuse. Integrating a spectrum of intense emotion with a staunchly logical perspective, Bialo portrayed Zade as a strong, complex character—the hero in the show, if one exists.  Moreover, superior execution by Jorgensen at critical moments during the show created a skillful balance between a pitiable and a gruesomely fascinating M. In the moments when M. had more than a line, such as when he talks about removing his own eyes, Jorgensen totally embodies a waifish woodland apparition who contentedly chews away on his own heart. Jorgensen managed to bring a refreshing levity with his idiosyncratic, Cheshire-cat-like statements while capturing the darkness and tension of the production .
 
Jonathan J.S. Longcroft’s ’15 portrayal of S., the figure who Eve and Zade are running from, is equally stellar. Longcroft delivered a phenomenal performance, one that allowed the audience to feel the siblings’ terror of the sinister “Daddy.” With controlled delivery and complete power in body language and speech, Longcroft is a chilling, intimidating presence, looming physically and metaphorically over the other characters.
 
With a sparse set featuring a motif of veins and vines on the stage floor to ground the space during lit scenes, the lighting by Aaron S. Graham-Horowitz ’15 takes on a greater role.  The first scene was diffusely lit, as if from a setting sun, creating a tone of trepidation that foreshadowed a plunge into night. This all-encompassing darkness made the audience imagine the woods as evil and menacing, with rustling sound effects by Mariel N. Pettee ’14 that encouraged thoughts of dangers that slither and pounce. The usages of light slightly modulated the sepulchral tone throughout the production.  In one scene, when Zade lit a fire, a diffuse, orange-red light became visible onstage,  but it lacked enough radiance to make anything visible besides the siblings’ hands: the result was eerie and strangely comforting.
While the script lacked depth in parts, the directorial choices helped elevate the performance. Throughout the production, a recording of the actors’ voices echo or in tandem with the real-time spoken word of the characters and was ominous as well as potentially risky. Rather than detracting from the production, it lent greater urgency to the show’s pacing.
 
“In the Dark” is ambitious and complex, and the talented cast and crew delivered a provocative, thrilling performance to mitigate the questionable parts of the script.

Remember when figure skating was popular—even events that weren’t the Olympics? The days of Michelle Kwan in all of her glory? What happened? Good question. The recent Olympics—specifically, the contested results of Women’s Figure Skating (“Yuna should have won!”)—brought to light some of the major problems currently plaguing the sport.
Before 2002, judges gave marks on a scale from 1.0 to 6.0, 6.0 being the perfect score. At the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, there were reports of some behind-the-scenes work on the judges’ panel, resulting in skewed judging and a complete overhaul of the 6.0 system. The International Skating Union instead implemented a system in which each of the jump and spin elements were worth a certain number of points. The judges have the power to add or subtract points from a given element, as well as full control over the artistic score.
A full understanding of the judging system requires a lot of time and experience with the sport. The ISU believed the new system would make it impossible for judges to swing scores in the favor of any particular skater. And, for the first few years after its implementation, it was probably somewhat successful. Over the course of the past few years, however, it’s become more and more obvious that competitions have been rigged. To the figure skating community—and beyond, given the uproar from fans and news sources—Sochi was simply a firm affirmation that something needs to change.
What’s wrong? Judging has evolved to the point where bias is palpable: Big mistakes seem not to matter and the audience has no clue how the rankings are decided. We saw this in March 2013 at the World Championships in London, Ontario, Canada: The skating community expressed outrage when Canadian skater Patrick Chan, who fell twice, nonetheless beat out Denis Ten of Kazakhstan who didn’t make a single mistake.
You probably didn’t hear about this instance—after all, it wasn’t the Olympics, and Yuna Kim wasn’t involved. The uproar over Sochi, at least, meant the public has become concerned as well. Admittedly, it’s a tough call to say who really should have won. Adelina Sotnikova, the Russian who won gold, skated well; her technical elements were harder than silver medalist Yuna’s. That being said, the Korean skater’s artistic ability is arguably miles beyond Adelina’s. And though the scores of Italian bronze medalist Carolina Kostner weren’t as high, her abilities rival those of Adelina and Yuna.
But it’s interesting to consider a hypothetical scenario—what if the Olympics had been held in Japan? Would Nagoya native Mao Asada, who placed sixth in Sochi, have medaled? She had a stellar free skate, but dropped like a rock in the standings after the short program–would sympathetic judges have been more forgiving? What about the 15-year-old Russian girl, Julia Lipnitskaia who placed ahead of America’s Ashley Wagner? The young girl fell a few times yet Ashley remained on her feet. The final rankings are all contingent on differences in a few points here and there, leading to placements that the audience doesn’t understand.
There are many things the ISU could do to try to reduce the bias in judging. The organization could make it so that judging is not anonymous, meaning skaters and the public could hold judges accountable for their decisions. Or it could change the way the artistic score is calculated. Humans aren’t perfect, and judging will always be somewhat subjective. But figure skating is currently in a dire state; unless the judging system is revamped, I worry that many—competitors and fans—will give up on the sport entirely.
Yuna is definitely one of the best skaters in the world. But she took time off after winning the 2010 Olympics, and only returned to competition in 2013. She is in fact technically weaker than she was four years ago. Adelina and Carolina, on the other hand, both improved dramatically over the course of the past few years. So while I don’t think the final results were fair, I’d hesitate to confirm that Yuna definitely should have come out on top. It all comes down to this: No matter how shiny that gold medal is, it will always be tarnished by judging that was questionable at best if not downright unfair.
Christina H. Gao ’17 lives in Leverett House. She has competed internationally for Team USA for five years, earned the 2012 Skate America silver medal, and contended for the 2014 U.S Figure Skating Olympic team.

In a recent column, Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14 called for the suppression of research that opposes our deepest values. She compared the American Studies Association’s boycott to boycotts of scientific research: We boycott Israeli academic institutions, she argues, because they (oppressively) restrict the freedom of Palestinian students; so too should we boycott scientific research (for example, research examining whether genetic differences in IQ exist between races) with results “justifying oppression.”
I think the column draws a misaligned analogy between boycotts like those of Israel and boycotts of scientific research. The former ones target institutions that directly counter Korn’s values (by treating racial groups unequally) and would also include research conducted with unethical methods (perhaps experiments that involve animal torture). The latter ones target research that opposes Korn’s values not by methods, but by potential results, which she believes will promote injustice.
I’d like to suggest that there is a fundamental difference here. Experimental results, unlike institutional practices, cannot run counter to our values since they are neither moral nor immoral but amoral. I’ll start by addressing Korn’s central question: If we oppose social injustice, “why should we put up with research that counters our goals?”
We shouldn’t. But the analogy carries an implicit premise; it only works if scientific truths do in fact imply moral values—if intelligence being genetic would justify oppression.
And science can do many things, but it can’t justify oppression. After all, science tells us the way things are. It tells us what is natural. But just because things are a certain way does not mean they ought to be that way. And just because something is natural does not mean that it is good or right or just. If we believe people should be treated equally, an institution that treats them unequally opposes our values. But even if it were true that people are born with unequal capacities, this would not imply that we should treat them unequally.
But the history! Didn’t Darwin’s theories validate social Darwinist episodes of racism, imperialism, and Nazism? No, not really. These same evolutionary concepts were used by T.H. Huxley to justify a very opposite notion of humanitarianism. Just because someone uses a scientific fact to justify a morally charged behavior doesn’t mean that the scientific fact does justify that morally charged behavior. Anyone telling you that science alone provides the basis for human ethics is making a fallacious appeal to nature, and should be ignored.
When we talk of egalitarianism, we tend to idealize a world that is fair, a world in which we’re all born with the same capacities and opportunities and, through our choices and hard work, rise or fall to where we deserve to be. But this is not the case—we don’t choose our parents, whose socioeconomic status and values and, perhaps, genetics, have a great impact on our opportunities. And, more importantly, it doesn’t need to be the case. People don’t need equal biological capacities (height, eye color, and potentially intelligence) to be of equal worth. We are looking in the wrong direction if we turn toward science to discover moral truths; we create our own values.
Yet my biggest concern with academic justice is the precedent it sets for future research. Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran once noted that the greatest scientific revolutions—the Copernican, Darwinian, and Freudian—all kicked our notion of what it means to be human off of an artificially elevated pedestal. Copernicus said we aren’t the center of the universe. Darwin noted that we share the same ancestor as monkeys. Freud told us we have no control over many of our actions.
How would academic justice deal with these visionaries? It would strip them of their funding or suppress their results. And why? Because their truths challenged the status quo and threatened long-cherished beliefs. And who would decide whether research countered values? I don’t know and I don’t want to find out—the idea reeks of subjectivity and hidden agendas.
Yes, facts can be perverted or misinterpreted. Truths can be uncomfortable. But the potential for human hiccups and disillusionment does not change the fact that we’re better off for having learned these uncomfortable truths (which allowed us to reach the moon, develop more effective antibiotics, and better help those suffering from mental illnesses).
Consider the case of affirmative action. It was undeniably uncomfortable to ask and discover that certain races and socioeconomic groups are more successful than others. But this uncomfortable truth—initially suggesting inequality—is being harnessed for egalitarian change; colleges can analyze disadvantaged applicants’ achievements in light of their limited opportunities and consider that inequity when evaluating their potential.
Scientific truths don’t control us morally any more than we control scientific truths. Rather than closing our eyes and plugging our ears (which, by the way, wouldn’t make these truths cease to exist), we’re better off confronting them in the long run. After all, we choose how to apply knowledge, and can leverage it to effect the change we want in the world. But we can’t start making the world what it ought to be before we know what it is. And we know what it is through research.
When exercised with ethical awareness and understanding of research’s implications, academic freedom is academic justice. So let the experiments continue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After several years without any professors specializing in Latin American history, Harvard has seen a significant expansion of the field with the addition of three new specialized faculty members within the history department over the past two years. We applaud the recent decisions of the history department to develop the field of Latin American history as way to diversify the education made available to students, as well as the culture of the university as a whole.
 
The field of Latin American studies has generally been an overlooked one at Harvard, as evidenced not only by its dearth of faculty members, but also by its absence in the catalogue of primary concentrations. African and African American Studies, East Asian Studies, Germanic Language and Literatures, Romance Language and Literatures, Slavic Literatures and Cultures, South Asian Studies, and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations all exist as concentrations at the college, spread out across several departments, while none exist that pertain specifically to Latin America.
 
This has not been for lack of student attention or interest. Indeed, two Undergraduate Council tickets last semester advocated for the establishment of a new degree program in Latino and Latin American studies. Former UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Vice President Jen Q. Zhu ’14 also supported the same policy more than a year ago when the pair ran for office, with little to no progress made on the issue.
 
From 2009 to 2020, there will be a 46 percent increase in Latino students in the U.S., compared to a 25 percent increase for both African Americans and Asians/Pacific Islanders. Harvard has been following such a trend for years, as Latinos made up 12 percent of admitted students last year versus 8.5 percent in 2003. This growth in current Harvard Latino students, along with the future growth to come, highlights an increase in demand as well as the University’s efforts to increase diversity through programs such as affirmative action. However, this goal is compromised if Harvard’s education cannot parallel its own professed ideology. The History Department’s recent faculty additions offer congruence with the University’s pursuit of diversity—along with its commitment to excellence in scholarship—and should be commended.
 Former President of Harvard University Abbott Lawrence Lowell said that “a well-educated man must know a little bit of everything and one thing well.” Mastering one area of study is no problem for students at Harvard, but knowing “a little bit of everything” certainly can be when our own college leaves a Latin American void on the world map. The History Department is taking a much-needed step to fill this void by hiring three scholars in Latin American history, and we hope other departments will take similar steps.

I am not proud to identify as heterosexual. That’s not to say that I’m a self-hating straight person, or that I’d opt to desire other men if given the conscious choice. I just don’t care enough about sex to worry about the gender identity or sexual phenotype of the person to whom I’m attracted.
At the same time, I do “know” that I am a straight male. Not necessarily a zero on the Kinsey Scale—maybe a one or even a two (more on this later)—but straight enough to realize that I am entering dangerous territory in opining on the gay rights movement. My perspective is ineluctably tainted by subjectivity, and my sexual apathy likely isn’t shared by many—Freud would tell me to see a psychoanalyst before my repression manifests itself in some more troubling form. 
As we approach the threshold of marriage equality and full legal rights for gay folks, I wonder how far we’ve progressed toward that elusive goal of social acceptance. That is to say, are we really any closer to embracing the fact that people of the same gender, or those who don’t fit the gender binary at all, are physically attracted to one another?
Gay intimacy remains taboo and sensationalized in a world in which film and print regularly depict the personal lives and bedroom activities of heterosexual couples. R-rated movies contain enough heavy petting and exposed heterosexual flesh to render this 19-year-old a squeamish mess, yet I can recall few mainstream American productions in which two men or women did the same. The recent attention bestowed upon the French film “L’inconnu du lac” by director Alain Guiraudie may herald the arrival of a new era of acceptance, though this movie remains confined to the art house. 
Why has marriage equality advanced even as progress on screen has, for the most part, stalled? The fault lies with the notion of gay pride itself. Before you burn me in effigy, however, I encourage you to at least finish this op-ed—after all, it’s the least you can do for a man who may have just sealed his political fate.
I’m not saying that sexual minorities need to accommodate the manifold sensitivities of straight people—that would simply hinder the cause of social equality while promoting a perverse sort of double consciousness. Rather, the sharp distinction between “gay” and “straight” has become a sexual binary that perpetuates a notion of otherness, when all sexual affinities should be understood as part of the same spectrum. 
The gay community, however, is just as much a part of the national landscape as any other marginalized group—to ignore this reality would be tantamount to ignoring Jim Crow for the sake of better race relations today. The challenge, then, lies in recognizing and affirming gay history while seeking integration with the rest of society on terms that recognize the equality of all sexualities.
Institutions such as the Office of BGLTQ Student Life here at Harvard are counterproductive because they promote the sort of separateness that must be overcome. A superior alternative would be a single GSD (gender and sexual diversity) office that could assist students of all sexual orientations and gender identities, from straight to asexual to transgender, as they navigate the waters of sex and relationships. 
To suggest that we need separate institutions for separate groups is to forsake commonality for an “us” and “them” mentality.
Surveys and indicators such as the Kinsey Scale are equally harmful as well as indicative of the sexual paranoia that grips our society. As Paul Rudnick points out in a 2011 piece in the New Yorker, we have a prurient compulsion to scientifically categorize our differences; just consider the burgeoning collection of letters in—and the number of groups that are excluded from—the acronym LGBTQ. For a change, let’s ditch the labels all together—not in a jejune way that overlooks difference, but in a way that accepts diversity as part of a larger whole. I’m not a number or letter, but a human being, and that’s true of us all.
Gay pride, however, seems to be here to stay for the time being, and it might just be the best response so long as the legal cards remain stacked against the gay community. After all, a separate existence is better than no above-ground existence at all. 
But at the same time, I feel that the sexual and gender identities of the people we love are of so little import that we must ultimately discard what strikes me as an outmoded, disjointed way of looking at the world. We all owe the gay pride movement our thanks for helping to bring our laws into the modern era, but it’s time to move beyond the politics of separate but equal and embrace the things that make us the same.

EdX, the open online learning platform co-founded by Harvard and MIT, has partnered with Facebook to give Rwandan students free access to collaborative, online courses. The partnership, dubbed SocialEDU, was announced Monday and will serve as a blueprint for future projects, according to a press release from Facebook.
“Improving global access to high-quality education has been a key edX goal from day one,” Anant Agarwal, president of edX, said in the press release. “In partnering with Facebook on this innovative pilot, we hope to learn how we can take this concept to the world.”
Facebook will be collaborating with edX to develop a mobile app that will deliver an educational experience through social media.
“We felt that this was just a great partnership all around,” said Matthew J. Malloy, the vice president of marketing for edX. “We’ll be working with Facebook, very closely with Facebook, to determine what are the social features that matter in learning.”
Both Facebook and edX have strong ties to developing African countries. According to Malloy, Facebook has already launched initiatives in Rwanda, and edX has also forged connections to the area. Agarwal noted that almost half of the 2 million edX students come from developing countries with nearly 10 percent from Africa alone.
As Facebook and edX prepare to launch the program, they face several technical barriers that call for additional partnerships with telecommunication companies and local governments.
Rwandan students often lack access to the smartphones they would need to participate in programs offered by SocialEDU, Malloy said.
“In the end, we know education is inherently social, and in many cases, education will be delivered on mobile devices,” he said.
According to the press release, the telecommunications company Nokia has also volunteered to give SocialEDU enrollees affordable smartphones, which the government of Rwanda also plans to subsidize.
The limited bandwidth available throughout Rwanda poses another obstacle to providing online education to Rwandan students. Courses operated by edX generally require strong internet access to transfer large amounts of data.
As a result, Airtel, a telecommunications company, will be supplying bandwidth to SocialEDU users for those who participate in the program for one year, according to the Facebook press release. The government of Rwanda has also pledged to provide free wi-fi access to school campuses throughout the country, while working with edX to adapt course content for Rwandan users.
“When you look at all the people who came together, they’re some of the top people in the industry,” Malloy said. “Together, our motivation is to figure out what makes learning social and how can we get the benefits of social learning.”
Since the program remains in the early stages of development, SocialEDU will only be offering a single course, according to Malloy.
“We’re reaching out to our consortium partners to help identify what is the right course,” Malloy said, noting that the class would probably teach students about a science, technology, engineering, or math field.

The Academic Integrity Committee has agreed to recommend a review of the disciplinary sanctions handed down by the College’s Administrative Board, with plans to bring the recommendation to the Faculty Council sometime in March, according to Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris.
The recommendation comes amidst discussion of potential reform of the College’s process of adjudicating academic dishonesty cases, a key part of a larger proposal for the College’s first-ever honor code.
If implemented as outlined in a mid-January draft, the honor code would establish an “honor board” to hear academic integrity cases, with half of the seats on the board occupied by students and the other half occupied by faculty members and administrators.
Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison said in an interview last week that such a review would be likely because of the honor board discussion.
“I would guess that any discussion of changes, alterations, additions to any of the processes covering academic integrity or disciplinary [action] should make us stop and take a look at the sanctions and see if they’re appropriate, if they’re appropriate in every case, do we need more nuances, do we need more options, what’s working, what’s not,” Ellison said.
The Ad Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, currently hears several types of disciplinary cases, including alleged academic integrity violations and peer dispute complaints.
When adjudicating a case, the Ad Board has several sanctioning options, according to its website. Those options include scratching a case; taking no action; “admonish[ing]” a student for his or her actions; putting a student on probation; and requiring the student to temporarily withdraw from the College. In extreme cases, the Ad Board may also recommend that the Faculty Council dismiss or expel a student from the College.
Harris wrote in an email Tuesday that what will happen with the sanctions review following the Academic Integrity Committee’s recommendation is “unknown.” He did not go into greater detail about who would review the sanctions or whether such a review would address the sanctions handed down in all cases or just those involving academic integrity.
According to Ellison, the Ad Board’s sanctions have been reviewed with some regularity in the past. In 2009, the Committee to Review the Administrative Board—which was chaired by now-Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister—wrote a report that called for, among other points, an expansion of the Ad Board’s possible disciplinary sanctions in academic dishonesty cases. In spring 2010, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences ratified some of the Committee’s proposed changes, approving two new sanctions that could be handed down in academic dishonesty cases.
More recently, the Ad Board process came under increased scrutiny last academic year with the fallout of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest cheating investigation in recent memory. Roughly 125 students were accused of plagiarizing or inappropriately collaborating on a final take-home exam in the case, and roughly 70 were required to temporarily withdraw from the College as a result.

Graduate School of Education associate professor Meira Levinson discussed the role of educators as agents of the state and the need for dialogue about justice within the educational sphere at a lecture Tuesday afternoon.
She greeted audience members at the lecture, entitled “Dilemmas of Justice in Schools,” with a controversial case study that featured a freshman student with a history of drug use who was caught with marijuana on school grounds. When school leaders had to determine his punishment, they faced a moral quandary—one that demonstrates, she said, the struggle of educators as they balance considerations of disciplinary actions for individual students with those for the collective student body.
“The problem with educators who care about justice is that they often find themselves in a situation where there are no just actions to think about, but they still have to act,” Levinson said. “It is not clear that there is any action—at least at school-level—that can be fully just.”
Levinson then described her new project, Justice in Schools, which aims to spark dialogue among educators regarding the role of justice when handling students so that they can approach tough decisions like the one raised in the case study. 
“My project is not aimed to answer the question of what is just,” Levinson said.  “What we are trying to do in part is to help educators, principals, school board members, and policy makers have better conversations about questions of justice.”
Levinson said that because educators become agents of the state—the body that is responsible for enacting justice—when they are hired to work in public schools, teachers are responsible for enacting justice as well. 
“[Educators] are often the most prominent and obvious and explicit representatives of the state,” she said. 
In the coming months, Levinson’s team will host pilot groups of teachers to experiment with ethical discussions. The project is “very much ideas in progress,” and she is still looking for cases that could prove instructive for teachers, she said.
“The purpose of my project is not to say that ‘A’ actually trumps ‘B’ or ‘B’ trumps ‘A.’ It is to enable educators to have that kind of conversation,” she said.
Levinson said that she and her team plan to implement the project in different schools, adding that they already have several schools that are interested in working with them.
Following the lecture, Andree-Anne Cormier, a visiting fellow at the School of Education, delivered commentary on the presentation, describing the project as “really innovative both for philosophy and education.” 
The lecture took place at Longfellow Hall as part of the School of Education’s Civil and Moral Education Initiative.

Scientists at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have moved one step closer to successfully printing three-dimensional, fully-functional tissue. The research, published early last week in the journal Advanced Materials, represents a significant leap toward a longer term goal of producing tissue that can undergo drug screening and substitute diseased or injured tissue.
Jennifer A. Lewis, SEAS professor and senior author of the study, said that the research differed from previous attempts at 3-D printing human tissue because they were able to successfully embed vascular networks into the printed tissues.
“Most of the efforts in tissue printing have been able to print cells and extracellular matrix, but they haven’t been able to include the vascular network, and that limits the complexity of the tissues you can print,” she said.
 
Building on previous work at the University of Illinois, Lewis and the team of researchers, including the study’s lead author David B. Kolesky, began working on the 3-D printing project last February. It took exactly 365 days before their research was released virally last week.
Lewis said she chose Harvard as the location for her research because the surrounding area served as an ideal backdrop for work in the biomedical field.
“Boston and Cambridge are a mecca for biomedical technology and a biomedical community, and doing the work here I thought would really be a good place to launch this effort,” she said.
Looking ahead, Lewis and her team plan on continuing research on 3-D printed tissues, beginning with further exploration of the development of the vascular network.
“What we want to do is use 3-D printing to create and direct some of the architecture in the tissue,” she said. “Then [we] let biology take over and create the finer capillaries and the things that you’d have in your blood vascular network in your body.”
After mastering tissue printing, Lewis said she hopes to use her research to tackle some of today’s most pressing scientific problems.
 
“Our first step is to explore what we can harness through 3D printing and what we can couple with biology to create the next generation of tissue architectures,” she said. “We want to explore their use for drug screening, and then ultimately, we want to be able to create more complex tissues that might even be able to be used for tissue regeneration and repair.”

Though typically associated with the destruction of structures, termite colonies may have inspired the next big innovation in construction. A team of engineers and computer scientists at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering built a “colony” of autonomous, interchangeable robots—coined the TERMES project—based on the construction strategies of termites and other insect species, according to a report published in Science earlier this month.
 
The TERMES report, co-authored by computer science professor Radhika Nagpal and graduate students and researchers Justin K. Werfel and Kirstin H. Petersen, is founded on the notion of collective intelligence. Trained as an engineer and a physicist, Werfel began collaborating with Nagpal while he was a Ph.D. candidate. Together, the two developed an interest in termites’ mound-building techniques.
 
“There are a number of insects that build,” Werfel said. “Termites inspired us by the scale of what they build. They’re less than one centimeter long, and they build the equivalent of skyscrapers.”
 
Over the course of researching mound-building termites, Werfel came across an article Petersen had published regarding a similar interest in the insects, but with an emphasis on hardware. Reaching out to Petersen, Werfel discovered that their studies aligned in “a very complementary way.”
 
“My question was how to program these robots, and hers was how would we build them,” Werfel said.
 
Unlike centralized intelligence systems, the TERMES robots are interchangeable, independent, and expendable. Each individual robot is equipped with four types of sensors that allow it to navigate its local environment. These robots are not assigned specific roles. While this model of collective intelligence sacrifices the flexibility and efficiency of a centralized system, the decentralized system compensates in other ways.
 
“One of the advantages of the decentralized system is that it is more robust to losing individual components,” Werfel said. “If some of the robots break or are lost, it doesn’t matter to any of the others.”
The researchers suggest this model of a construction crew—which requires no supervision and boasts low costs once the robots are built and programmed—opens up possibilities for human construction projects as well. Instead of delineating tasks to each worker, an architect could present an outcome to the robots, and they could be programmed to carry out the task automatically.
 
Spearheaded by engineers, the project has led its researchers into the fields of biology and architecture. All three authors have visited Namibian termite hordes to implement data collection mechanisms in native mound-building colonies.
 
“Obviously we’re not entomologists, and we’re not trying to do something they can do much better,” Petersen said. “But we’re computer scientists, so we can help them by building tools that will allow them to gather much more quantitative and qualitative data on the termites.”
Underlying Nagpal, Werfel, and Petersen’s work on the termite-inspired robots are a series of broader questions about the emergent outcomes of many individual actions.
 
“It’s easy if you have a lot of low-level rules to predict the high-level outcome,” Petersen said. “If you have specific high-level outcome in mind, it’s hard to figure out what the lower-level rules should be.”

A month after Congress passed a budget easing federal research funding cuts that had gone into effect in early 2013, Harvard administrators said last week that while research prospects may be looking up, the future remains uncertain for scientific research.
 
“They all will say there has never been a more exciting time to pursue science, and at the same time, there is a time of concern about support from the federal government and other sources to pursue that work,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications and the University’s top lobbyist in Washington, D.C.
 
In January, Congress passed a budget package that provided some relief from the effects of sequestration for the 2014 fiscal year. Casey said that “even with this budget deal, we have not returned to where we before.”
Sally J. Rockey, deputy director of extramural research at the National Institutes of Health, agreed, saying that the decline in research funding is “quite difficult for organizations like Harvard, while the NIH budget is flat and the cost of research continues to rise.”
 
Between 1998 and 2003, the NIH budget more than doubled, growing from about $13 billion to about $27 billion. Since 2010, however, the budget has fluctuated between about $27 billion and $31 billion. In 2013, the NIH had the lowest grant success rate in history and lost $1.5 billion due to sequestration cuts.
 
Casey said that NIH funding “comprises over 70 percent of the federal research base at Harvard and a larger percentage at the School of Medicine and School of Public Health.”
 
From 2012 to 2013, Harvard Medical School lost $19.3 million in federal expenditures and the Harvard School of Public Health lost $8.2 million. Harvard received more than $650 million in federal research sponsorship in FY 2012, before sequestration took effect.
 
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said that “for Harvard as an institution, the consequences are varied.”
 
Researchers across the school are constantly struggling to find sources of funding, administrators said.
 
“All of the researchers are spending a much higher percentage of their time writing grants in order to keep their work,” Casey said.
 
Constantly searching for funding has detracted from the ability to perform research, he added. And funding from outside sources may not be sufficient to replace NIH funding.
 
New sources of funds, such as from technology and pharmaceutical companies, have shifted the focus of scientific research. But Garber said that the new shift to applied sciences has left researchers concerned about basic research.
 
In addition to repercussions for faculty researchers, the decline in research funding has experts worried about students’ ability to pursue research.
 
“It’s an issue that we see at every level—it’s an issue for undergraduate students, it’s an issue for grad students, it’s an issue for postdocs,” Garber said.
 
While Garber also said that “we still do have a large number of incredibly talented students who decide to pursue careers in science,” experts worry that the daunting task of finding research funding is deterring young scientists from careers in research.
 
Despite competing priorities on Capitol Hill, Rockey said that she hopes that the importance of scientific research for public health and the economy will encourage “some sustained growth of the NIH budget in the future.”

The Democratic Party’s five gubernatorial candidates fielded questions from students and discussed campaign details at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics Tuesday night, with all candidates focusing on education reform and mental health issues.
The candidates, who include Joseph Avellone, Donald M. Berwick ’68, Juliette N. Kayyem ’91, and two current state officials—Massachusetts Attorney General Martha M. Coakley and State Treasurer Steven Grossman—opened the forum with brief presentations on their respective campaign platforms before moving on to answer questions regarding mental health and education reform.
Each candidate said that mental health is a priority in their campaign, with Berwick vowing that if elected, he would implement policies that would cut drug abuse and suicide rates in half in the next 10 years.
Coakley said that she thinks it is important to reduce the stigma that surrounds mental and behavioral health issues, discussing the story of her brother, who refused to see a specialist about symptoms of bipolar disorder and later committed suicide.
“We’ve made it a shame, a weakness to be mentally ill,” she said. “We have to encourage our vets to get help with [post-traumatic stress disorder]. We’ve seen the results of failing to do that…. I believe MA is the state that should do it. We have the biopharmaceutical industry here; we have the best doctor’s here. It’s time to end that stigma.”
Candidates also shared plans of action to improve the school system.
“My two goals for education are to close the achievement gap...and [make] sure every student is career- and college-ready.” Avellone said.  “We know [pre-kindergarten] works, and we know we can get a much higher literacy rate by the third grade. This package is my highest priority and will be funded as my first priority.”
“I think student participation defined the evening,” said Daniel R. Ki ’15, president of the Harvard College Democrats and moderator for the evening’s forum. The Harvard College Democrats co-sponsored the event.
The forum concluded with students collecting information about getting involved in the campaigns. The candidates will continue their campaigns with local caucuses this weekend.

By modifying cotton and polyester fabrics with a coating that repels almost any type of substance, a research team from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering could be close to changing the nature of several consumer and industrial products—as well as the need for laundry.
The team, headed by materials science professor Joanna Aizenberg, has exhibited various applications of the award-winning SLIPS, or Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces, a slick coating that repels water, oil, tomato juice, eggs, wax, and blood, among other substances, since 2011. 
Then, as reported in the journal Nanotechnology last month, the team displayed the same resistant SLIPS behavior in cotton and polyester materials after scientifically modifying the fabrics. Although preventing stains in everyday clothing is one of the eventual desired uses of SLIPS technology, this most recent finding has tackled the problem of providing coating to specialty textiles exposed to extreme environments. By subjecting their SLIPS-fabrics to rigorous industrial tests specified in the technical manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, they found that these fabrics retained exceptional protective properties even after rubbing, twisting, or washing. 
“SLIPS-fabrics may provide a unique solution as a stable, anti-fouling material for specialty suits in demanding applications in extreme, contaminated environments for which no alternatives exist," Aizenberg said. 
The scientists suggested a broad range of applications of this latest modification, including tactical suits for military and firefighters, medical gowns and lab coats, and specialty garments for construction and manufacturing. Furthermore, certain properties such as anti-icing would provide an advantage in large awnings, tents, and open-air buildings such as sports stadiums. 
“We believe that such SLIPS-fabric is a novel material that, for the first time, confers pressure- and damage-tolerant omniphobicity on fabric-based substrates,” said Philseok Kim, a senior research scientist on the project. 
When designing the super-slick coating, the scientists found inspiration in nature—in particular, from the carnivorous pitcher plant. The plant utilizes a mixture of fluids and a mechanical trap to ensnare insects. By replicating these defense mechanisms, the scientists were able to develop a porous material which could hold the water in the same way a sponge holds water. 
“We do a lot of innovative science and fundamental research but at the same time we wanted to fill the gap between what you can achieve in the lab on a small scale under very controlled conditions and real world applications, “ Kim said.  “Academia usually focuses on fundamental research and industry usually focuses on the practical, but we need to bridge this, to fill in this gap—this is often called translational research because you are translating core technology into real world applications.”
In keeping with the theme of translational research, scientists working with SLIPS have experimented with coating other everyday objects. They found that a coat of SLIPS improved the efficiency of various appliances, such as refrigerators, by preventing the continual defrosting in the coils, ultimately reducing costs, freezerburns, and spoiled produce. They are also studying how SLIPS acts as an anti-corrosive barrier and works against marine-fouling, which could help increase the efficiency of ships by preventing barnacles from attaching, and thus slowing down, the ship. 
Beyond efficiency, the material also has the potential to change lives. The scientists said that the material could protect patients against bacterial infections, a significant problem in hospitals throughout the country. 
“SLIPS can help in reducing this risk, as it prevents bacteria from colonizing and forming biofilm in the first place,” said Kim. “SLIPS basically provides a non-sticking surface that intervenes at the very first step of the colonization…. If it works in the future, it could save a lot of lives,” said Kim. 
Kim said that the research team has been closely working with the CEO of the startup company and talking with several larger corporations regarding applications of SLIPS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New technology being researched by professors at Harvard Medical School has made methods of gene surgery more efficient and accessible and can potentially help to address major diseases caused by genetic disorders such as sickle cell anemia.
In January 2013, George M. Church, professor of genetics at the Medical School, and Feng Zhang, an Massachusetts Institute of Technology Researcher, independently showed that a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, paired with an enzyme named Cas9 can be used to edit gene sequences in animals and humans. Last month, according to a press release from the Medical School, researchers found that adjusting the length of RNA strands in the synthetic enzymes could decrease the possibility of off-target DNA mutations.
Although several older technologies for gene surgery have been developed in the past, the CRISPR/Cas9 system allows scientists to more precisely edit portions of genomic codes of organisms.
“It opens up the possibility of editing a variety of genomes and doing it on a scale that has never been done before,” said Church.
Gene surgery works by editing sequences of DNA base pairs which encode an organism and its behavior. CRISPR, which gets its name from sequences of bacterial DNA that aid in recognizing foreign viral DNA sequences, mimics the natural technology. Previous methods of gene editing were less precise, but CRISPR uses RNA and Cas9, a protein guided by an RNA molecule that removes specific gene sequences, to perform the deletion or edit.
According to Church, CRISPR technology is on the scale of 100 times easier, ten times more efficient, and increasingly more applicable to organisms than prior methods.
Church spoke additionally about the broad benefits that gene surgery could have on organisms.
Mutations in the human genome can have significant deleterious effects, including Huntington's disease and Cystic Fibrosis. With CRISPR, experts might be able to correct these disorders.  While Church notes environmental factors play a role in many ailments, he said that genetic editing can potentially override these effects.
“If you get very fine, accurate, and inexpensive control over your genome, you can fundamentally change the kind of organism you are,” Church said. “You are extending human capacity.”
Although Church acknowledges there are many ethical considerations involved associated with gene surgery, he said he does not feel that CRISPR technology would create a larger division between the rich and the poor.
Church said that the rapid “democratization of technology” and plummeting costs are making more innovations accessible to more people.
Last November, Church helped co-found Editas Medicine, a genome editing company that he said that he hopes will help push the technology into clinical trials within the next year or two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Feb. 27, 2014, at 12:20 a.m.
A task force convened last April by University President Drew G. Faust to formulate a new policy governing searches of electronic communications on the Harvard network has recommended a single, University-wide protocol that would require formal administrative approval, careful record keeping, and ultimately faculty oversight.
In six parts, the Electronic Communications Policy Task Force’s proposal lays out a wide range of potential reasons for access, rules governing authorization and notification, the scope of access when authorization is granted, a record-keeping procedure, and details about the potential oversight committee.
The proposal and accompanying report comes more than 10 months after Faust first commissioned the task force, which is made up of 16 professors and administrators from across the University and chaired by Law School professor David. J. Barron ’89, a former Crimson president. The group was conceived amid a scandal within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences last spring, when then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith broke Faculty privacy policy by authorizing secret searches of resident dean email accounts.
The proposed policy makes way, for the first time, for a single permanent electronic communications policy governing the entire University and would replace the interim set of standards Faust installed in August 2013. Prior to that interim policy, a patchwork of overlapping and contradictory policies governed distinct parts of the University and its faculties.


 
In addition to sewing together those discrete policies, the proposal appears to target issues that were at the forefront of the controversial email searches last academic year, including questions of notification and authorization.
Under the FAS faculty email privacy policy in place when the searches occurred, any search had to be approved by Smith and the Office of General Counsel and had to include a timely notification of the user involved.
The first round of searches, though appropriately authorized, did not include the notification of a resident dean suspected of sharing internal documents related to the Government 1310 cheating case. Administrators argued at the time that resident deans’ dual appointments as administrators and non-ladder faculty members created a procedural gray area where their administrative email accounts were not protected.
The second round of searches, authorized by Hammonds and the OGC but not by Smith, lacked both the required approval and notification, while also extending to the personal email account of the resident dean in question, explicitly violating the policy in place.
The task force’s proposed policy, presented Wednesday, aims to clarify the ambiguity presented by the first round of searches, stipulating that a query of any user with an academic appointment, even one who may act in an additional administrative role, must be authorized by the dean of the appropriate faculty.
The policy would also alter the chain of command surrounding electronic searches. Mandating that “a legitimate institutional purpose” be served by any search, the policy would concentrate authorization power in a single designated position. For faculty members, that authority figure would be the dean of the relevant faculty, and for staff employees, a human resources officer or administrator. For student accounts, the dean of the appropriate school would have to give approval for access.
In certain emergency situations, the OGC may authorize searches, but in the authorization process of most searches, the office would no longer be directly involved.
While the proposed policy would require the authority figure overseeing a search to notify the user when his or her account is accessed or “as soon thereafter as reasonably possible,” it leaves the University room to withhold notification in certain cases, including internal investigations, where notification may be judged impractical.
‘CRITICAL’ ACCOUNTABILITY
The report and proposal also lay the groundwork for novel record keeping and independent oversight, for which community members argued for last spring.
Specifically, the task force’s recommendation calls on authority figures overseeing inquiries to make “reasonable records and logs of the steps taken to access the information,” which are to be shared with the University Chief Information Officer and kept on record.
Those records would be made available to a University oversight committee composed of faculty members and senior administrators. The committee would not only make recommendations of policy and amendments to Faust, but also publicly report on the policy’s implementation.
The exact composition of the oversight committee has yet to be determined, Barron said, but he called faculty representation “key” and an independent set of eyes outside of the chain of authorization “critical.”
Barron also said that he expects searches of electronic communications to continue to be rare. In the last five years, there have been fewer than 15 cases of academic misconduct requiring electronic inquiries and fewer than ten cases of staff misconduct requiring such inquiries, according to the report. Still, Barron cautioned that these numbers may be incomplete due to a lack of consistent record-keeping.
According to the report, the task force met with roughly 500 members of the Harvard community, including leaders from the Undergraduate and Graduate councils, individual faculty members, staff, and administrators, and the Council of Deans. The task force also consulted the the Board of Overseers and the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing bodies. A few dozen people attended two open forums led by Barron last fall.
In a statement, Faust thanked Barron and the members of the Task Force for their effort.
“While many of the changes we face are complex and have yet to emerge fully, I believe that we now have a much clearer understanding of how we might navigate the road ahead,” she said in a statement.
 
Smith declined to speak with reporters about the proposal or the report. Smith has refused to answer questions about any topic related the searches since May 2013, when he last met with The Crimson in a sit-down interview.
 
The policy draft will be available to the Harvard community for comments on an online discussion board for the next two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There must be something in the Sunday brunches of Columbia junior Steve Frankowski. Across 24 career Ivy League games, Frankowski has averaged 5.9 points a game overall, but in his two Sunday afternoon contests the junior has averaged 21.5 ppg. Last year,  Frankowski totaled 27 points in a 15-point Columbia home win against Harvard.
On Sunday afternoon, the junior’s 17 points were crucial in the Lions’ 59-47 win over the Yale Bulldogs. The loss dropped Yale a game behind Harvard with four contests left in the regular season. The two teams will meet on Mar. 7 in New Haven for the penultimate game of both teams’ seasons.
Overall, the loss means little for the Crimson: if Harvard takes care of business in its final four games, it will win the Ivy League. Due to a weird Ivy League tiebreaker system, were Harvard to lose to Yale and each team were to win its other remaining games, the two teams—each at 12-2 in the league—would go to a playoff despite Yale having beaten the Crimson in both meetings.
For the Bulldogs, who missed 13 of 22 free throw attempts Sunday, the slipup could prove much more deadly. Harvard, with Columbia and Cornell at home next weekend, has an easier schedule than Yale down the stretch, as the Bulldogs must go on the road to face Princeton and Penn.
Even though the Killer Ps left last weekend’s tilts bruised, looking more like the Black-Eyed Ps, Yale has lost four of its last six matchups in both locations. Before sweeping both teams last year, the Bulldogs had lost the previous three meetings at both the Palestra and Jadwin.
As for Frankowski, perhaps he should have more hash browns on Fridays and Saturdays.

It was all Crimson, all game as the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (1-1) defeated Holy Cross (0-3, 0-1 Patriot League), 17-9, for its first win of the season. The Crimson began their first home match of the season with four straight goals and never trailed in the win.
“From the opening whistle were really strong,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We were first to the ball, had crisp passes, and were first to score.”
Harvard, thanks to its opening run, played every uninjured player in the matchup and 11 different Crimson players found the back of the net during the match.
“We had an impressive number of goal scorers in today’s victory,” Wojcik said. “[This] is a true testament to the players sharing the ball and playing great team offense.”
Sophomore attacker Deke Burns led all scorers, driving the ball past the Crusader goalie four times for his first career hat trick. While Burns was unable to tally a point against the University of Massachusetts-Amherst defense last weekend in a 8-4 loss, he ended the night with five points to his name.
“I think Deke had a very good game,” Wojcik said. “He was really sharp with his passing and his finishing and moving the ball.”
Burns finished the night with a perfectly thrown pass to sophomore and long stick midfielder Jack Breit. Breit put it past Holy Cross goalie Peter Hines for his second score of the game late in the fourth quarter, pushing the lead to 15-8.
“Breit provided a really big spark for us between the lines,” Wojcik said. “It’s impressive as a [midfielder] to score a couple of goals. And Pete Schwartz just consistently leads our team from midfield.”
Captain Peter Schwartz, who led the team in goals Saturday against UMass, was only able to capitalize once against the Crusaders, but tied for the team lead with two assists. The Crimson netted12 goals from sophomores, with Will Walker notching a hat trick and Sean Mahon, Sean McDonagh, and Brendan Newman chipping in one apiece.
“Coming out of UMass it was really important for us to rise to the occasion offensively,” Burns said. “We wanted to score a lot of goals in the first quarter, and I think we accomplished that.”
While Wojcik said that the offense, which struggled in the Crimson’s opening game, showed improvement when facing the Crusaders, the coach pointed to the defense’s struggles to block a number of Holy Cross attacking drives as a possible area of improvement.
“I think Holy Cross was able to just expose the little things of our defense’s weaknesses,” Wojcik said. “There were a few times when maybe we could’ve slid or done something a little better, and they made us pay. They are a really good team, and the last three years we have had trouble stopping them. They’re a very good offense, and I think we just need to be a little more in sync defensively.”
The Crimson benefited from 18 Crusader turnovers, helping to offset a 16-13 margin on faceoffs. Harvard won 60 percent of the ground balls on the day and converted half of its man up opportunities.
Last season, the Crusaders came within four goals of Harvard before ultimately losing, 16-12. On Tuesday, the Holy Cross attack proved to once again be a challenge for the Crimson defensemen. Junior Crusader captain Terry McKenna, with nine points on the season, scored four goals against Harvard’s back line.
Although Wojcik was quick to praise McKenna, he noted the improvement by junior goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky, who gave up eight goals on just 19 shots against UMass on Saturday.
“Terry McKenna is a top middy in the entire country,” Wojcik said. “But I thought Jake was very good in goal.”
Gambitsky, who spent the bulk of the time in goal for Holy Cross, ended the night with 10 saves and came away with big two ground balls. Wojcik said that before the team’s next matchup against Albany next Saturday, the team has to shore up its defense.
“We get back tomorrow and clean up some of the mistakes we made,” Wojcik said. “[Albany] has a good offense and a good goalie. We will clean up some of the mistakes made and just build on our overall good team performance from today.”
Though the Crimson will return on the road to take on Albany, Burns said the team enjoyed its brief one-game homestand. For the entire season, the Crimson will play just six games at home. “It’s always great to be home,” Burns said. “We love playing for our own fans on our own field, and it felt great to get the win today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard men’s volleyball team played Concordia last season, the Crimson was on the wrong side of a blowout, with the Eagles easily winning in straight sets. On Tuesday night, however, the Crimson (6-4, 4-1 EIVA) and the Eagles (14-4, 2-0 NAIA) went right down to the wire in a five-set thriller, with the Crimson eventually prevailing, 15-12, in the tense final set.
According to senior captain and libero Chris Gibbons, the final set was an extremely tense affair, with both teams nervous about making mistakes and neither team able to take control of the match. Neither side could open up a lead greater than two throughout the set as the Eagles came into the final stretch leading 11-10.
In a crucial point, a Concordia killbarreled down to the left of Gibbons that would have put the win within reach for the visitors. However, with very little time to react, Gibbons managed to get the ball up, setting up a spike by junior DJ White that tied up the game.
“I mean it’s great,” said Gibbons about the defensive stop. “That’s a lot of my responsibility on the court, playing good defense, so whenever I can get out there and stop the ball from hitting the ground–job success!”
The point swung the momentum of the game permanently in the Crimson’s favor. Aside from a service error by sophomore Branden Clemens, Harvard was dominant in the late stages with a kill by junior Caleb Zimmick finally putting the game to bed.
Crimson coach Brian Baise said that sort of defensive play was typical of Harvard throughout the match, which was consistent and clinical in the win. The Eagles was coming in on the tail end of 10-match win streak but their offense was stifled by the Crimson, whoheld Concordia to a hitting percentage of .209 on the night.
“We saw a lot of fight and drive [tonight],” Baise said. “We were sharp in the ways we needed to be and we’ve been working on. Our defense was in great form tonight and that’s been a harder thing for us. Our offense has been okay, but we’ve had a hard time slowing down other teams [yet] we were able to do that tonight.”
Throughout the game, the Crimson prevented kills with play at the net and in the backcourt.
“I think the difference between the sets we won and the sets we lost was good defense,” Gibbons added. “We were blocking well at the net and being aggressive with our serves so it was hard for them to get their offense going.”
Baise emphasized that it was not only stopping the opponents from scoring but also the ability to turn defense into offensive opportunities that was key in the Crimson’s victory. Harvard had a season-high 44 digs over the five sets, with Gibbons leading both teams with 15 digs of his own.
“Our blocking got better but really we had digs and were able convert those points,” Baise said. “We haven’t really been able to do that as efficiently as we would like [in weeks past] but you have to when you play teams like this.”
After the Crimson took the first set 25-21, the second set was an even closer affair. The Concordia defense found its rhythm late. After having allowed the Crimson to post a .407 hitting percentage in the first set, holding them to a .278 hitting percentage in the second set and a nearly identical .280 hiting percentage in the third set.
Though close throughout, the home side still found itself leading, 24-21, but with its back against the wall, the Eagles fought back. Three consecutive kills by senior middle blocker Mark Metrakos tied the game up as the set came right down to the wire, with Concordia eventually prevailing, 29-27, when Clemens committed an attack error that tied up the match at one set apiece.
“That was pretty wild,” said Baise of the second set. “I felt like we gave that set away a little bit. We made a lot of uncharacteristic mental errors. I felt like we were in control, but unfortunately it went the other way. After that I wasn’t sure if we would be able to come back and we were.”
Riding that momentum, the Concordia offense then posted a .391 hitting percentage in the third set to go up two sets to one, 25-20. Staring defeat in the face, the Crimson defense bailed the team out in the fourth set, completely shutting down the Eagles’ offense to send the game to a deciding fifth, which the Crimson won, 15-12, for its sixth win in seven contests.
Baise said after the game that the victory over a team that blew out Harvard last year is indicative of the team’s competitive mindset.
“I think [the game] tells us a lot,” Baise said. “It’s a non-league game and it’s sort of easy to look past it but coming off last weekend where we lost to Penn State [and] we beat St. Francis but didn’t play our best, I felt we needed tonight to see how we were going to rebound. I think this gives us a lot of confidence going into next weekend and reminding ourselves how we can play.”

Just under a decade ago, YouTube brought Internet users across the globe (or at least in countries without too much happiness-killing web censorship) the chance to waste hours watching clips of adorable sneezing baby pandas and atrocious Whitney Houston covers. It also brought Harvard upperclassmen the chance to upload sometimes creative, sometimes cringe-worthy videos advertising their houses.Housing Day videos have enchanted wide-eyed freshmen for years. Last year’s “Get Lowell” had freshmen longing for the House’s bells, while Pfoho’s 2010 “Hitler Gets His Housing Assignment” made the Quad seem more appealing than ever. Now, the first Housing Day video of 2014 has just arrived, and it makes Quincy House seem like an idyllic—if chilly—haven compared to the rest of Harvard’s (inferior) houses.But can any of these videos claim accuracy? Like most things media, Housing Day videos are all about the spin. To do students a service and set the record straight, we’ve come up with a few suggestions for more honest Housing Day displays.Currier HouseA student dressed as a tree—Currier’s inimitable mascot—strolls through Harvard Yard waxing eloquent about the joys of his home. At Widener Gate, he walks confidently toward the Quad Express shuttle, mentioning the comfort and frequency of the service. The shuttle drives away just as he reaches the door. The student shrugs his shoulders cheerfully, breaks out in a bridge about the pleasure and healthfulness of brisk winter walks, and continues to dance toward his home. As time goes on, his enthusiasm fades, bitterness creeps into his voice, and tears stream down his cheeks, catching in the leaves of his costume. The video continues for 20 minutes, Vanessa Carlton’s “A Thousand Miles” on a loop.Winthrop HouseA group of students wander the walkthroughs of Winthrop. It’s hard to see all of them because they don’t really fit in the room, and they seem to be fighting over who gets to sit on the bottom bunk and who gets relegated to the top for the performance. As they shout their own lyrics over The Who’s “Baba O’Riley”—more commonly known as “Teenage Wasteland”—roaches begin to pour out from holes in the floor beneath the disintegrating concrete bases of floor lamps. Bit by bit, Winthrop House falls to pieces, its residents pushing each other aside and into the wreckage as they desperately strive to save themselves. Game of Throp has never felt so real.Kirkland HouseSister Sledge’s “We Are Family” plays as Kirklanders make out to the tune. The video cuts off after mere seconds when the cameraman can no longer resist the urge to join in.
