The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Laramie Project” tells the true story of Matthew Shepard, a gay man who was beaten to death in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998 in one of the most infamous anti-BGLTQ hate crimes in history. Through a deep investigation of the small town, the writers of the play, Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project,  sought to expose the underlying bigotry within the community itself.
“I think with shows with serious and sometimes troubling and traumatizing content such as this one, it’s important to set your boundaries and expectations really early on in the process,” Eli B. Schleicher ’18, the director of the show, said. “We’ve come into the material knowing it’s hard, and so we pace ourselves and take it one step at a time, taking the appropriate moments and breaks to step back and reflect on what we’ve done.” Their care was evident in their rehearsal process, which they began by “checking in” and “checking out” with each member of the cast before starting: Each actor filled in surrounding cast-mates on their general well-being before entering the heavy material itself. The cast placed significant weight on the source material, as well as their own interpretations, thoughts, and well-beings.
The actors themselves drew upon their own experiences. Milan M. Williams ’21, an actor in the show, also reflected on how the play has affected her. “If I use language that implies that certain people don’t matter, or if I make jokes that are offensive—those statements do have weight, and they make people believe that ‘Oh, I can go one step further than a joke. I can go one step further beyond that.’ It can spiral and get dangerous really quickly,” she said. Working in with this material has brought to the forefront many difficult realizations about society and individuals for the cast, who say they are evolving alongside the play itself.
“It’s something that we all need to hear. It’s so important to really grapple with these ideas,” said Mike T. Shirek ’20, who plays many characters including Dennis Shepard, Matthew’s father. “It talks about a lot of issues that are here on our campus today.”
“The Laramie Project” will be playing at the OBERON from April 11 to April 13.

“And now the civilization on this little speck of earth was falling apart… Everything around us was changing except the stars in the sky. Under the postcard-picture sunset stood the fragile, naked life of our drunken bodies,” David Faulk writes of a day he and his friends climbed the mound in Moundsville, WV, in “Voices from the Rust Belt.” The remnants of manufacturing booms of eras long past—cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, Flint, and Buffalo—are fraught with longstanding racial tension, economic stagnation, and an overall sense of disillusionment with what it means to be American. The collection of essays paints a complex and intensely beautiful picture of a world in decline as a response to what editor Anne Trubek says the media has reduced the Rust Belt to: “Clichés… At a time when it is more important than ever to understand the nuances of this complex region, what is published instead are often articles on the ‘typical’ Rust Belt resident—more often than not a white male Trump supporter.” Trubek and the writers who contributed to the anthology are attempting to help the world understand their hometowns in all their incredible complexity.
The essays are incredibly diverse, ranging from lush literary prose to sociological research studies to a treatise on environmental conservation. The works are expertly curated and arranged by Trubek, alternating in style, focus, and racial and socioeconomic backgrounds of the writers. Essays include a small snapshot of a social worker’s relationship with a construction worker under hard times; a black woman’s memories of her white friends’ moves to escape the post-desegregation influx of black people into their neighborhoods; an image of a father washing his infant daughter in Flint’s contaminated water; and a broad survey of the housing crisis and gentrification that reinforces persistent racial segregation in Detroit. The more personal essays are generally more effective and memorable than the more objective ones, simply because they are more relatable. But the data gives the collection a necessary sense of weight and realness. Despite the range of styles, the collection as a whole somehow flows seamlessly between sections.
A common theme in the commentary is the ambivalence towards the newcomers moving into the Rust Belt cities, their racist implications, and the shifting values of what “real work” is. Referred to as the “latte drinkers” by Dr. Henry Louis Taylor, Jr., a professor of urban studies at the University of Buffalo, they are usually young white hipsters who seem to invade the cities of the Rust Belt with shallow pretensions, hedonism, and an almost colonialist romantic ideal of “finding yourself” in an exciting new wilderness. Aaron Foley, a Detroit journalist, heatedly points out the “undercurrent of racism when you talk about ‘adventure’ in a city that’s mostly black.” And Eric Anderson, who chose to stay in Cleveland working in factories despite his artistic dreams because he had a “a romantic notion” that the “filthiness” of hard physical labor “was what it meant to be a man,” finds himself resenting and envying the art school-trained artists who move into his city and find immediate success in their gallery shows. The American concept of what “real work” is prevails throughout this collection, and shows signs of a fraught metamorphosis.
“The whole identity that I had built, even as a small child, was a proud Akronite,” writes Jason Segedy, the director of planning and urban development of Akron, Ohio. “This is the RUBBER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD; this is where we make lots and lots of Useful Things for people all over the world; this is where Real Americans Do Real Work; this is where people from Europe, the South, and Appalachia come to make a Better Life for themselves…” There is a deep sense of nostalgia for simpler times, and it is easy to see how important the manufacturing industry was to the region, how central it was in shaping the identities of its people, and how close it was to their hearts.
While the collection as a whole does a great job of capturing the vague, sweeping notion of the American spirit of the majority, some chapters can feel like token representations of minorities, such as the single chapter about a gay bar in Cincinnati or the one about an Iraqi woman who finds a community of Iraqi women in Cleveland. Although well-intentioned, there is something a bit troubling and superficial about adding these like decorative splashes of color to make a point about the region’s diversity. And a quick look at the brief biographies at the end of the book shows that most of the contributors are highly educated writers, teachers, and academics. Many aspiring writers in their brief memoirs mention their time in graduate school, specifically creative writing MFA programs. Although not very surprising, given that the collection is of the literary genre, this may be a limiting factor in the broad range of perspectives and backgrounds that the collection aspires to be.
Despite its limitations, “Voices from the Rust Belt” is overall beautifully written and highly immersive, thanks to its wealth of details and well-researched sociological data. Its best attribute is its ambition to depict the Rust Belt in all of its glorious messiness. As Jason Segedy writes, “We Americans are… not so comfortable with that messy and confusing historical cycle of boom-and-bust, of evolution, of creation and destruction and reinvention. But that’s the world as we actually experience it, and it’s the one that we must live in. It is far from perfect. But for all of its trials and tribulations, the world that we inhabit has one big advantage: it is real.”

Meg Wolizter’s twelfth novel, “The Female Persuasion,” is the feminist novel of our time—well, kind of. The book’s protagonist is college freshman Greer Kadetsky, whose father’s failure to properly fill out financial aid forms for Yale forces Greer to attend the much less prestigious but fully funded, fictional Ryland University. There, she meets her soon-to-be college best friend Zee and continues her long-distance relationship with her high school boyfriend, Princeton-bound Cory. Zee encourages Greer to attend a lecture held by Faith Frank, a feminist icon who Greer comes to idolize. When Greer starts working with Faith after graduation, she starts to reevaluate her relationships, especially with Faith, as the idolization that blinded Greer to Faith’s imperfections slowly falls away. “The Female Persuasion” is about about a young (white, middle class) woman’s coming-of-age journey during and after college (not wholly original in concept, and that’s okay) but in trying to address too many of today’s problems with how women are treated, depicted, even idolized, Wolitzer spreads herself too thin.
“The Female Persuasion” is set in the late 2000s but is fully aware of the context in which it was published: 2018, a politically-charged climate that the issues in the book speak to. The novel is noticeably conscious of the systemic issues of today, from poor representation to sexual assault, and makes sure to respond. Zee is queer, and Cory is the son of Portuguese immigrants. Greer becomes an activist when she is harassed at a college party, only to learn that dozens of other women have also been harassed by the same student, whose only punishment is a slap on the wrist. She questions the status quo and the lack of change. “Things like misogyny, which seems to be everywhere, kind of wallpapering the world, you know what I mean?” Greer asks of Faith the first time they meet. “It’s still acceptable in the twenty-first century, and why is that?” However, the book starts to feel hollow, pervaded with anecdotes and details that initially speak to our time but eventually oversaturate the narrative with what feels prescriptive. Just as the scales gradually fall from Greer’s eyes regarding her relationship with Faith, the scales fall from ours as Wolitzer seems to speak through her characters instead of letting them speak for themselves.
Still, her characters are fully-realized, and this is to the novel’s benefit. “You needed to find a way to make your world dynamic, Greer knew. Sometimes you couldn’t do it yourself. Someone had to see something in you and speak to you in a way that no one else ever had,” Greer thinks to herself. For her, that someone is Faith. But Greer suffers from the age-old insecurity of not seeing herself accurately. Though she is undeniably intelligent, Greer struggles to articulate her thoughts. “It was always so much easier to turn a statement into a question, because in the end you could backpedal and say you were only asking, and then you wouldn’t have to endure the shame of being wrong,” she laments about her inability to speak in public.
Greer may not believe in herself, but it is clear that Wolitzer does. The author subtly sprinkles moments of self-awareness in Greer’s narrative, hinting at a maturity that Greer embodies but is slow to understand. Be it in random thoughts that universally resonate (”Nothing was wrong with her nose, but she knew it would always be part of her view of the world. Greer had understood it was hard to escape yourself, and to escape the way it felt being you”) or in instances that characterize Greer’s uniqueness (she choses passages to annotate in “Tess of the D’Urbervilles” the passages that “‘stir [her],’ she said, without self-consciousness”) Greer is a fully realized character. Her insecurities and insights color what could easily have been a monotonous, stereotypical coming-of-age story.
But while complete, characters fail as a panacea for the novel’s gaping flaw, which Wolitzer addresses but never resolves. “Time to give another pep talk to straight white middle-class women,” a rival says about Faith magazine. Greer acknowledges the limits of the feminism Faith advocates for, and by extension, Wolitzer admits that her book cannot represent the experiences of all women—and it shouldn’t. Greer is one woman, and her circumstances are unique to her. But acknowledgement can only take one’s self-awareness so far. By the end of the novel, Wolitzer’s attempts at inclusion and representation, from Zee and Cory’s identities to Greer’s criticism of Faith’s white, cisgender feminism, feel compulsory. What initially made Greer a complex, multifaceted character—she betrays Zee by making a selfish but human and relatable decision, for example—ends up undermining Greer’s convictions and judgment of Faith. Greer may be compelling in her own right, but her hypocrisy is something the novel fails to sufficiently reconcile.
“There are two kinds of feminists. The famous ones, and everyone else. Everyone else, all the people who just quietly go and do what they’re supposed to do, and don’t get a lot of credit for it, and don’t have someone out there every day telling them they’re doing an awesome job,” Zee says when her relationship with Greer starts to devolve. The novel unknowingly, or at least unintentionally, argues that the difference between the two types of feminists lies in its inclusion (or lack thereof) of different identities and experiences. It seems like Faith is one of the famous ones; Greer’s hypocrisy makes her into one. And though the book, written with a realism that really does ring true, champions women’s voices as much as it criticizes them, it only barely scratches the surface of what feminism can look like, making the universality of its title feel more contrived than genuine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Office of Student Life recently announced it will not renew a $50,000 grant previously used to fund student organizations’ transportation to events. The OSL defended this decision in part by alleging that transportation grants had in the past been misused. However, without informing students of the impending loss of funding, the OSL has left some groups on financially shaky ground, and some are in debt after spending money on travel under the assumption that the grant would reimburse them.
In the past, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who leads the OSL, has stated that she and the Office are “committed to transparency.” By contrast, this cancellation came without warning or any indication that a cut to such funding would be occurring. This is not only unfair to the leadership of student groups who must now deal with an unexpected loss of funding, but also to students themselves, who may not be able to attend certain events without significant spending from their own budgets. Additionally, the OSL’s sudden decision calls into question whether the student body can trust the OSL (or any future office that will employ its staff) to be transparent about other issues in the future.
We accept that the OSL should maintain fiscal responsibility and ensure that the money it provides is put to good use. As it functioned in the past, the application for OSL funding was open to all student groups in good standing, as well as individuals traveling to academic conferences. We acknowledge that some students and student groups may well have misused the funding, which the OSL should strictly monitor and appropriately punish. We do not believe that voiding the entire grant for the upcoming year constitutes the latter.
The benefits to funding travel are sundry, as doing so is beneficial to enhancing students’ education, diversifying opinion, and equalizing the experience of students from differing socioeconomic classes. This type of funding is especially useful to students and organizations who cannot afford to travel without aid. Especially in light of its the recent report by the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, the University is contradicting its own focus on inclusion by cutting transportation grants. We maintain that funding student travel is a good allocation of resources, and that other solutions exist to combat the risks of the grant being exploited. We also maintain that even if the OSL needs to trim its budget, transportation grants should not be one of the first programs to go.
Indeed, in contrast to the OSL’s current course of action, the funding for this particular grant was originally increased from $20,000 to $50,000 in 2014, as recommended by a College working group on student organization transportation. The working group was originally convened shortly after a student’s death in a car crash while driving back to Harvard from a mock trial tournament. This tragic history demonstrates the importance of funding safe transportation, and we urge the OSL to reinstate it as soon as possible.
Ultimately, this course of action taken by the OSL is misguided on many levels. In order to continue to emphasize economic diversity, safety, and student extracurricular involvement, we urge the OSL to reconsider this choice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the time I learned that a student could exercise the right to look at her admissions file, I have wanted to peek behind the curtain of Harvard admissions. So against the advice of this newspaper’s Editorial Board, I filed a viewing request, waited 36 days until my appointment, and sat for 30 minutes in a conference room with a notebook, a pen, and my mysterious file.
Obviously I knew the admissions office’s final decision, but I wanted to see their steps along the way. What were their impressions of me? How were they evaluating me? I knew that their deliberation would not purely be one of merit. The myth of “meritocracy” in college admissions, particularly in Harvard’s admissions, has been debunked. There are the suspicious stories of famous, seemingly less-than-qualified candidates gaining acceptance over others. There are also the suspiciously similar admit rates for certain demographics each year.
But even if college admissions are not a true meritocracy, it does not mean that the concept of merit has been completely abandoned. When reading my admissions file, I found myself considering who exactly merited my admission, though. Me? Or the person in my file, who was not quite the same?
My file contained lines my interviewer quoted from me—lines I remembered preparing in advance. I apparently justified my aspiration to be a journalist with the reasoning, “Words have power.” I imagine I would have had to be deeply terrified and desperate to utter such a trite phrase with a straight face. Further on, my interviewer noted that I explained why I applied for a job at a museum by saying that I wanted to challenge myself to improve my public speaking skills. The statement was not exactly false, because my public speaking skills had been worse before, and the job had helped me improve. But I had thought it would be a good line, a smoothing-over of my personal narrative, and I delivered it right on cue during my interview.
One of my application readers imagined a possible mathematical future for me at the College, as evidenced from my calculus teacher’s recommendation. Here, I am sorry to disappoint. I have not taken a math class in college yet—not so much as dropped by one during Shopping Week. Indeed, I increasingly hope never to have to do so. Instead, I merely let my TI-84 graphing calculator gather dust on my desk.
As for other predictions of my future life at Harvard, I am gladly fulfilling the one that I would work on various publications, even at this moment. Interestingly enough, my interviewer also predicted that I would be an “avid participant” of the Phillips Brooks House Association. While I am a member of a PBHA program, I would not count myself an “avid” one. I especially pale in comparison to the many peers I know who dedicate much more time, effort, and genuine heart into their community service activities.
So how do I reconcile these two people—the person that the officers and interviewer assessed and admitted, and the person now attending Harvard? This question of merit grows more complex with each action the second person makes.
Admissions officers judge one’s merit by looking at one’s past accomplishments and circumstances. But merit is not just about one’s past—it is about one’s future potential. Prior success only matters in so far as it suggests that one can achieve even more success with access to the Harvard community and the Harvard name. That’s why the admissions file contains numbers predicting one’s viability as a roommate, contribution to college life, intellectual originality, and more. They want to quantify potential, distill it into some easy-to-read numbers, because this is the crucial measure.
But because merit is about potential, the success of judging by merit—whether one actually merited what one got—can only be assessed in hindsight. It will not be the person in the admissions file, or even the person in the college classroom, who determines merit. It is the person that one becomes from going through college, from living in the “real” world, which is more ruled by meritocracy than elite universities, who will determine whether the admission was justified.
Discussions of merit should therefore take the long-term view. We in the College are still in the short-term, though—the verdict on our “merit” is still out. So while I encourage those who want  to look at their admissions file and satiate their curiosity to do so, I do not believe one should linger on it too long. For me, at least, regardless of what exactly got me here, I continuously work toward a future in which I can say I merited what I got.

Get woke.
Any woke person knows what that means. You don’t need to look up the Merriam-Webster or even Urban Dictionary definitions to know I am not using incorrect grammar to try and get you out of bed in the morning. I’m telling you to open your eyes and become socially engaged. I’m imploring you to educate yourself on current events and political issues. Being woke is being plugged in and being actively aware and involved with the world around you.
However, the word holds a partisan undertone that we usually don’t even notice, and if we do, that we probably don’t disagree with. The word "woke" implies that to support the liberal viewpoint is to be socially aware. Woke people are heavily informed and actively involved with liberal social issues. If you’re leading a Black Lives Matter protest, you’re probably woke. If you’re calling your congressperson to advocate for Planned Parenthood, you’re probably woke. If you’re handing out pro-life leaflets, however, you probably will not receive the woke label.
This biased nomenclature is rooted in a belief held by some on the left that people are only conservative because they are uneducated. If only people were smarter, more informed, more woke, then surely they would see the Democratic light and switch sides. Nevertheless, it is crucial to see the fault in this mindset.
Some of the most woke—socially informed and engaged—people I know are woke from the right. I know conservatives who watch the news 24/7 and don’t let a single current event slip their notice. I know people who utilize grassroots efforts to engage with their community to raise awareness for an issue that is of the utmost importance to them: anti-abortion legislation. Conservatism is not about being misinformed and being woke is not about liberalism. There are educated, impassioned individuals on all sides of an issue.
I do acknowledge that the origins of the word "woke"  stem from the black community and its fight for equality. I understand that, historically, racial equality has been primarily driven by liberals, and hence the historical connection between the word and partisanship is natural. However, woke is spreading. It is taking on new meaning and new reach. Woke is starting to become an umbrella term for all that is just, thus making justice synonymous with Democratic political platforms.
Such a usage of language is merely one example of rampant political polarization in the United States. We would rather assume that people on the other side are misinformed or downright idiotic than acknowledge the viability of different opinions or priorities.
Furthermore, we have reached a point where we often isolate ourselves from people with differing political opinions. This is harmful in the obvious sense: It diminishes open, enriching political discourse. However, even more harmful is the reduction of individuals with whom we disagree to nothing more than their political beliefs. We allow our own self-image to be defined by our political identification. We fail to realize that people are more than their votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. People have families, friends, hobbies, passions, thoughts, and priorities. A Trump voter is not necessarily a raving racist, and a Clinton voter is not necessarily trying to leech off your hard-earned money. They are simply people who have different opinions than you. Those opinions do not make them dumb or evil. Those opinions do not have to mean that they are not woke. They are different, but they are not invalid.
If you are shaking your head right now, I implore you to pause for a moment. Can you look at yourself and label one single opinion that comprehensively defines your entire identity? I certainly hope not. We should all acknowledge our complexities as individuals and refuse to be defined by a single term. Then we should extend this same courtesy to others.
So, I don’t want to be woke. I don’t want to restrict my definition of activism and intelligence to only include those who agree with me politically. I want to be open-minded and engaged. I want to be informed and passionate. I want to be an advocate and a human being beyond political issues. Maybe we can broaden the definition of “woke” to include these characteristics from both sides of the political spectrum, but until then I remain contently un-woke.

A car engine burst into flames on Linden St. Thursday evening and burned for roughly ten minutes before firefighters stopped the blaze.
The car’s driver, who declined to give her name, said that, as she was driving, a man walking down the street informed her her engine was smoking and urged her to get out of the car.
“I watched while the car turned into a fireball,” she said.
No one was injured in the fire as of Thursday evening, though the blaze attracted at least one fire engine.
“There was a car fire,” Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Robert L. Walsh said.
The fire took place across the street from a property owned by the Delphic, one of Harvard’s final clubs.

The Cuba Studies Program of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies recently announced an effort to digitize part of its Cuba-related collection through the Harvard Library.
The Library currently contains the largest collection of Cuban monographs in the United States, with materials published on a wide array of subjects, including literature, economics, botany, anthropology, music, fine arts, and history. According to a press release, the goal of the digitization is to provide free access to the material for the general public.  The release further notes that these efforts correspond with the University’s goals to “expand academic cooperation” with Cuban scholars and institutions.
In Dec. 2017, Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education to promote increased research partnerships and post-graduate training programs.  The agreement came after increased U.S.-Cuba tensions prompted by the Trump Administration's reversal of Obama-era policies intended to normalize relations with the country .
Lynn Shirey, librarian for Latin America, Spain, and Portugal, said that she hoped the digitization would enhance future research collaborations between the U.S. and Cuba.
“There’s a clear directive that we’re trying to be more open towards Cuba, to share researchers, and to share resources, as well,” Shirey said. “Given that Harvard has historical collections that are strong in Cuba, the library feels that we should contribute to this effort.”
According to Shirey, the Harvard Library is working with a group of other U.S. universities, led by the University of Florida, to share U.S. collections of Cuban materials with the José Martí National Library in Cuba. In turn, the José Martí National Library is making their bibliographic records available in WorldCat, a global catalogue of library collections, and embarking on complementary digitization projects.
The Harvard Library is currently digitalizing the José Augusto Escoto Cuban History and Literature collection, which includes 63 archival boxes of material at Houghton library. The collection includes historical documents and letters from 19th century Cuba, a time period marked by slave revolts and independence movements from Spain.
“There are a lot of important documents about schools, hospitals, roads, setting up government in early colonial Cuba, maps, lots of interesting material in that collection, and Cuba does not have access to that, because anyone who is in Cuba would have to travel here to use the collection,” Shirey said. “And it’s a big part of their history.”
David Gonzalez ’20, treasurer of the Harvard Cuban-American Undergraduate Student Association said he appreciates the preservation and increased access to Cuban history.
“I feel like it’s really important to have accessible records to Cuba, especially before the past fifty years, which have been so dramatically transformative for Cuba,” he said.

UPDATED: April 7, 2018 at 6:55 p.m.
When Lawrence S. Bacow takes office in July, he will be the third Harvard president to oversee the development of the Allston campus since former University President Lawrence H. Summers first outlined plans for a campus there in 2001.
He will also have roughly a year and a half before the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences emerges from its Cambridge chrysalis and migrates across the river.
The University's presence in Allston was  a central issue during the search for Harvard's 29th president. The committee met with Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III multiple times in the early stage of the search. In a February interview, Shirley M. Tilghman, a Corporation and search committee member, called the campus “a once-in-a-century opportunity” with national potential.
With its new campus, SEAS will be able to provide more opportunities than ever to its faculty and student bodies, both of which have grown at breakneck pace. The campus will also bring Harvard’s ambitions to become an engineering powerhouse on the scale of rivals MIT and Stanford closer to fruition than ever before.
But the University’s project in Allston entails more complications than just managing SEAS expansion. Harvard’s relations with neighboring Allston have been rocky at times, and many Allston residents have expressed skepticism—if not downright displeasure— about the construction site and its eventual occupants.
It will fall to Bacow to make sure this “unprecedented opportunity” does not become, as some faculty called it in 2013, an “Allston bomb.” Many of his colleagues at Harvard said they think he is up to the task.
Top administrators at Harvard, like Doyle and University President Drew G. Faust, said they have faith in Bacow’s ability to manage the Allston campus.
Doyle said he thinks Bacow’s time at MIT and Tufts—he served as president of the latter—will give him a “perspective that’s different when it comes to things like engineering and the connection to the private sector.”
“I think he'll resonate with me on some opportunities I perceive that Harvard is only now positioned to be able to do in things like working with industry partnerships for students, for recruiting, for internships, for faculty projects, for a whole host of things,” he said. “So I’m really excited to sort of tap the expertise that he's built up at both his Tufts and his MIT experience.”
The presidential transition marks a seismic shift at SEAS—from a “growing phase” to a “launching phase," Doyle said.
“We've gotten a wonderful gift like Paulson’s gift, we've got these new buildings opening up, we've got a critical mass of students and faculty now,” Doyle said, referring to a $400 million gift billionaire John A. Paulson gave the school in 2015. “So what we do with that, how we capitalize on the opportunity that Drew has helped us grow, is the challenge for Larry and I going together.”
Both Doyle and Faust said they were impressed by Bacow’s extensive knowledge of Harvard’s Allston holdings—a knowledge built up over time while he served on the Harvard Corporation, the University's highest governing body.
Bacow joined the Corporation in 2011; he is still a member, though he will need to step down before he takes office as president. As a member of the Corporation, Bacow served on Harvard's official presidential search committee—until Dec. 2017, that is, when he stepped down to assume the role of candidate
Doyle said Bacow spent a lot of time working on issues related to Allston while on the Corporation. Doyle added he felt “buoyed” by “the fact that Larry comes in with momentum in thinking about the opportunity for Harvard, what we can do in Allston.”
“He was already focused on Allston,” Doyle said. “It was one of his assignments within the Corporation, so we spent quite a bit of time talking about Allston.”
In a March interview, Faust said Bacow spoke about Allston “with a degree of expertise, engagement, and granularity about real estate matters.”
“He got to the end of his sentence and I said, 'I’ll tell you, Larry, my reaction to this is wow, how lucky Harvard is to have a president that knows all this about real estate at a moment when we’re developing the enterprise research campus,'” she said.
Bacow's time on the Corporation, though, was hardly the president-elect's first foray into the world of engineering expansion.
At both universities where he has held high-level administrative positions in the past, Tufts and MIT, Bacow was responsible for a large engineering contingency—even larger than Harvard’s.
At MIT, where Bacow served as chancellor from 1998 to 2001, engineering faculty currently make up 36 percent of the institute’s professors. At Harvard, engineering professors comprise only 11 percent of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
While at MIT, Bacow’s position as chancellor meant he was forced to oversee all of the institute’s departments, including its large engineering faculty.
“He was good about thinking about things strategically. If you wanted to talk to him about direction, he was a good person to talk with,” said John Guttag, former head of MIT’s department of electrical engineering and computer science.
“So I was a great admirer of his. I thought he was really good at what he did at MIT,” Guttag added.
After MIT, Bacow became president at nearby Tufts, where in 2003 he and his new provost recruited a dean for the University’s engineering school, Linda M. Abriola, formerly of the University of Michigan.
“He is the reason I came to Tufts. I was extremely impressed by his vision for the university,” Abriola said. “I was excited by the opportunity to work with him and build the engineering school there.”
During Bacow’s term as president, Tufts enlarged its engineering faculty by about 20 professors, according to Abriola.
“It was quite a significant expansion of the faculty of the school,” she said.
Abriola said one of her top priorities during her deanship was to expand the research presence of Tufts’s school.
Engineering faculty at Tufts also spoke positively of Bacow’s leadership at the school.
“I saw him as very much somebody that was very approachable, easy to talk to,” said Chris B. Rogers, chair of the department of mechanical engineering at Tufts.
He added that Bacow was supportive of fundraising efforts for the Center for Engineering Education and Outreach at Tufts, which Rogers from 2003 to 2014.
While SEAS expansion brings challenges on the institutional front, there are also hurdles inherent to expanding into a new neighborhood. As construction concludes, and as Harvard students, faculty, and affiliates begin crossing over to Allston regularly, Bacow will need to mediate historically strained town-gown relations.
In recent decades, Harvard has come under heavy criticism for its handling of University affairs in Allston. In June 1997, Harvard announced it had secretly spent $88 million to acquire 52.6 acres of land in Allston between 1988 and 1994, a move many Allstonians saw as an unwelcome and deceptive intrusion.
Bacow, however, has experience navigating this kind of terrain. While he was at Tufts, Bacow dealt often with a town-gown relationship similar to that of Harvard-Allston: that between Tufts and Somerville.
“Those of us who grew up [in Somerville] remember the days when there was barbed wire around the campus of Tufts,” said Joseph Curtatone, the city’s mayor since 2004 and a longtime Somerville resident.
“There was always, from a Somerville perspective at least, this feeling that we just weren’t appreciated by the university,” he added.
During his time as president of Tufts, Bacow made attempts to mend historically rocky relations with the city.
In 2004, he negotiated a 10-year deal with the cities of Medford and Somerville that gave each city an average of $125,000 per year, the first such agreement between Tufts and its home cities.
The agreement promised “additional consideration” in the application process for local students, who would be eligible for special financial aid. Residents who wanted to audit Tufts classes were also eligible for reduced tuition.
“He really started to build a bridge away from the old, gated approach toward our city to one of inclusiveness,” Curtatone said. “He earned the respect and credibility of everyone in our community.”
Martha Pierce, education adviser to former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, wrote in an email that Bacow’s work was well received in the city, which is home to the university’s medical campus.
“There is no question that Larry dramatically advanced the relationship between the City of Boston and Tufts,” she wrote. “Mayor Menino often referred to Tufts as a leader, and Larry as the model President.”
But for some Somerville residents, Bacow’s efforts fell short in establishing a positive relationship between the city and the university.
Edward Beuchert, a Somerville resident and member of the West Somerville Neighborhood Association, said Bacow’s failure to construct on-campus housing inflated prices for local residents.
“One of his lasting legacies here in the community is that he basically continued the Tufts policy of increasing student enrollment without building new dormitories on campus. While he was president, there was just one relatively small one that was built in 2006,” Beuchert said.
Dorothy DiMarzo, another Somerville resident, agreed with Beuchert, saying the increase of students in the Somerville area increased demand for housing.
“It drives the prices up,” she said.
DiMarzo and Beuchert also pointed to the $125,000-per-year agreement as insufficient to fund city operations.
“Really that turns out to be very little, when you analyze the overall situation and how much it costs Somerville to support Tufts,” Beuchert said.
The issue of payment in lieu of taxes—PILOT—as these agreements are often called, will be a salient one for Bacow as he manages Harvard’s presence in Allston. Boston calculates a recommended payment for every nonprofit entity within its borders.
In fiscal year 2017, the city requested $569,899 from Tufts for its Longwood campus, which Tufts paid in full. The same year, Harvard did not match Boston’s recommended PILOT contribution of $6.1 million for its properties in the city.
Asked to respond to criticisms of Bacow, Harvard spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson did not directly answer. She separately pointed to Harvard's past record of making PILOT payments.
“Harvard has a long history of making regular and consistent voluntary PILOT payments to its host communities,” Jackson wrote in an email.
“The university seeks to strike an appropriate balance between taxes, voluntary payments in lieu of taxes, and funding direct mission-related programming in our neighborhoods,” she wrote.
In a letter to Harvard affiliates in 2003, Summers wrote he was tentatively optimistic “for the future of Harvard’s expansion."
“Planning for how best to take advantage of the Allston opportunity poses an uncommonly challenging task," he wrote.
Fifteen years later, Harvard's soon-to-be president is still talking about—and hoping for—a future in Allston.
“Allston gives us a chance to forge new partnerships, both intellectually and others, between Harvard and our neighbors, between Harvard and our sister institutions, between Harvard and the rest of the world,” Bacow said at a press conference announcing his selection as the University's 29th president in February. “It also gives us the opportunity across all of Harvard to envision the university of the future, and to bring that future to life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors Kevin A. Hassett expressed optimism about President Donald Trump’s economic policy and spoke about his work on economically challenged communities at an Institute of Politics event Thursday.
The event was this year’s Malcolm Wiener Lecture on International Political Economy. Douglas W. Elmendorf, Dean of the Harvard Kennedy School, introduced the evening’s speaker. Jason Furman ’92, a current Kennedy School professor and former chairman of the CEA under Barack Obama, moderated the discussion.
Furman began by asking what he called “the question is everyone is most interested in” —what it is like to work in the Trump administration.
“It’s not at all like you think. I’m surrounded by people I really like to work with. Everybody’s really nice to me. Nobody’s leaking bad stories about me to the press. We’re serving our country, and our spirits are high,” Hassett said.
Hassett said the hardest part of working in Trump’s White House is the administration’s turnover rate.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been in an organization where people are leaving once a month. I really liked Gary Cohn. I hate to see him go,” he said.
Many of the evening’s questions focused on Trump’s economic policy and the recent tax reform bill. Hassett was enthusiastic about the prospects for growth under Trump’s leadership.
“Everyone’s outlook for growth has gone up a lot, like about a percent,” said Hassett.
Hassett was similarly optimistic about the tax bill.
“The data have been surprising us on the upside already,” he said.
He explained, “If you go pore through the data, you see massive tax effects already in the fourth quarter. There appears to have been anticipatory capital spending.”
Later, Hassett discussed his work on severely economically challenged, or “distressed,” communities. The term “distressed communities” comes from an annual index compiled by the Economic Innovation Group, which ranks the prosperity of communities throughout the country. Hassett was a founding adviser of the group.
At Thursday’s event, Hassett explained how the tax bill provides wealthy companies with incentives to invest in these areas.
“If they invest in those distressed communities and then keep investing in those distressed communities, then they can take their investment returns and not pay taxes on them,” he said.
Hassett said he hopes “it’s going to become a social norm that the wealthy in our country want to help the distressed communities.”
“I even expect that places like Google or Microsoft will try to enforce the social norms,” he added.
Several students in attendance, including Kennedy School student Chen Liu, said they enjoyed listening to the evening’s speakers.
“They set up a very good example for us as students,” Liu, who is from China, said.
“I feel very positive, not only [for] the future of America’s economy, but also [for] China, and the world,” she added.
Furman concluded by asking Hassett about the big questions he is interested in answering in the future.
Looking ahead, Hassett said he is interested in the information revolution. He explained how the widespread availability of information in the modern era forces people to determine for themselves what they think is true.
“I think that we’re living in an information revolution right now, and deciding how it plays out is something that I’m just very obsessed with because it’s a very hard question, and I’m not really sure what the right answer is,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously voted to begin autonomous vehicle testing on city streets at a meeting Monday.
The adopted policy order, which defines autonomous vehicles as “self-driving cars,” states that Cambridge will join a regional AV testing program put forth by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Metropolitan Mayors Coalition of Greater Boston, with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the Governor’s Office.
According to City Councillor Quinton Zondervan, who sponsored the policy order with Vice Mayor Jan Devereux, autonomous vehicles have already been on city streets but are still being operated by human drivers. The newly adopted framework would allow a self-driving car to be turned on “autonomous mode” in Cambridge, given certain conditions.
Among these requirements are a minimum of two test drivers per vehicle, an adherence to all city speed limits such as new 20 mph safety zones, and the submission of data and information gathered from the tests upon the city’s request.
Another precaution consists of a step-by-step system that ensures the companies advancing the AV testing are meeting safety thresholds. The companies have to follow a “clear progression of increasingly difficult situations” before self-driving cars can be completely autonomous, Zondervan said.
This testing of self-driving cars continues after an AV operated by Uber killed a pedestrian in Arizona on Mar. 18. Following the fatal crash, Arizona Governor Doug A. Ducey suspended further AV testing in the state. After the accident, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh also ordered a moratorium on AV testing in Boston.
Zondervan said one of the problems in Arizona was the vehicle’s high speed, highlighting that testing self-driving cars in Cambridge would have to be done “very carefully and very slowly.” Devereux agreed that AV testing in Cambridge would be different.
“Arizona has different policies than Massachusetts does for the testing that they’re doing. Uber is using different software, and it’s not one of the companies that is involved in the Massachusetts testing,” Devereux said. “Fortunately, there is a better way and a safer way to move the technology forward.”
Just last week, Walsh reinstated Boston’s AV testing program, which partners with technology companies like nuTonomy, Optimus Ride, and Aptiv. According to Cambridge’s policy order, these companies have demonstrated a “stellar safety record” in AV testing across the world.
“One of the companies, nuTonomy, has also tested vehicles in Singapore, which has a very different driving culture,” Devereux said. “They recognize there are regional differences in driving styles and rules and roads.”
According to Devereux, companies would undertake AV testing within the context of Vision Zero, a strategy unanimously adopted by Cambridge in 2016. The strategy strives for zero fatal crashes, Devereux said, whether the vehicles are autonomous or not.
“I found the conversation really reassuring that safety is driving what they’re doing, and that it’s not a rush to bring to market autonomous software that isn’t ready,” Devereux said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Education hosted a panel discussion Thursday on the effects of surveillance programs that target Muslim and minority youths in schools.
The discussion focused on the Countering Violent Extremism program, an anti-terrorism initiative being piloted in three U.S. cities—Boston, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. The CVE program began under President Obama in 2011 to counter various types of radical thinking. The Trump administration has since shifted the program’s focus to primarily target Islamic extremism, according to Reuters.
Abeela Latif, an Equity and Inclusion Fellow at the School of Education focusing on International Education Policy, organized the event with the Muslim Justice League in conjunction with the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration and Rights. The MJL is based in Boston and works to advocate for communities “threatened under national security pretexts.”
“Until a few months ago, I had never heard of CVE,” Latif said. “So I set myself the task of educating myself about what CVE is. Once the picture started to take form, I realized that this is a critical issue, and it’s a critical time to have this conversation.”
The panel featured three experts and was moderated by Aaliyah El-Amin, a lecturer on education at the GSE, and Daren Graves, an associate professor of education at Simmons College. Alim H. Islam, a senior caseworker at CAGE—an advocacy organization for communities impacted by the War on Terror—called in via video-chat from London to discuss the United Kingdom’s anti-terror Prevent programme.
Islam related several case studies of young people persecuted by the Prevent programme, including a young man who wore a bracelet in support of Palestine to school one day and was subsequently tracked and interrogated by police officers.
Fatemah Ahmed, the deputy director of the Muslim Justice League, discussed the role of the U.S. government in the implementation of CVE programs. Since 2010, the Department of Homeland Security has given out more than $10 million in grants to implement CVE programs across the country, according to Ahmed. Programs often focus on specific communities. For example, one program in Boston focuses specifically on the Somali community—three of the five CVE grants that have been awarded to Boston target the Somali community, Ahmed said.
“People will say that CVE is community-led,” Ahmed said. “But when the community sees how CVE is being carried out, their members are definitely not happy.”
Aleena Durrani, of the Montgomery County Civil Rights Coalition, said that surveillance programs can be hidden from public knowledge by various program names.
“In Maryland, it’s called BRAVE—Building Resilience Against Violent Extremism,” Durrani said. “It’s essentially CVE, but it is disguised by a newer, brighter acronym.”
Latif says she hopes to follow this discussion with another event next semester.
“We just wanted to get the conversation started,” she said. “We hope to take a deeper dive into this issue in the fall.”

UPDATED: April 17, 2018 at 2:35 a.m.
Harvard students collaborated with community organizations, called their legislators, and discussed increasing rates of homelessness in Cambridge and Boston as part of the Phillip Brooks House Association’s second annual Housing Awareness Week.
The week’s housing awareness events were hosted by PBHA in conjunction with Harvard Habitat for Humanity, Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, and Y2Y, a student run overnight homeless shelter for young adults aged 18 to 24.
“The main goal is to raise awareness of the situation of current housing and issues of homelessness,” said Cora Neudeck ’19, PBHA’s Advocacy, Health, and Housing Programming Group Officer, who helped organize the initiative.
Jorge Ledesma ’19, a co-organizer of the week’s events, said he agreed.
“I think when we are really focused on our school, which we should be, sometimes we forget that there are a lot of problems going on right in our backyard,” he said.
Neudeck also said the organizers hoped the influence of Housing Awareness Week would extend beyond merely educating students on housing issues.
“We wanted to incorporate elements of action as well, so that way people can get involved,” she said.
Housing Awareness Week kicked off with a Poverty Teach-In on Saturday, during which students met with community groups to discuss poverty-related issues.
On Wednesday, students gathered in the PBHA parlor room for a conversation with Julie B. Wilson, a lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, Phillip Martin, a Senior Investigative Reporter at radio station WGBH, and Allison E. Torsiglieri ’16, a case manager for HomeStart, an organization that works to combat homelessness in the Greater Boston area.
The discussion focused on the current state of homelessness in Cambridge and Boston. Drawing upon facts, data and personal experiences working with the homeless, the panelists spoke about the complexity of homelessness in the area and also the search for solutions.
It will require “the cooperation of a lot of people from different backgrounds in order to resolve the issue,” said Sina Sadeghzadeh ’21, an advocacy director at Habitat for Humanity and panel attendee.
The panelists also emphasized the importance of humanizing the homeless.
“Even if you can’t find them a home, just listening to their story is important,” Wilson said.
Martin said he felt hopeful that students could mobilize to combat homelessness the same way that student advocates have mobilized for gun control in recent weeks.
“The very things that we think could only happen in the abstract could happen in reality with this level of commitment,” Martin said.
“There are people and professionals out in the community who want to come out and talk to students,” Torsiglieri said. “That is a really great way for students to know even what other careers are available to them that involve working on these issues.”
On Thursday, students congregated in Sever Hall to phone bank for legislative action on homelessness. Callers urged their representatives to support several bills in the Massachusetts Legislature supporting the homeless that include provisions like expanding access to ID services, increasing funding for housing and wraparound services for unaccompanied youth, and publicly recognizing unlawful discrimination of youth experiencing homelessness.
“We have so much space here and at the same time, it’s incredibly, incredibly difficult for people to look for housing,” said Boris Davidov ’19, who participated in the phone bank. “That’s always ignited a flame in me, to wonder why we have these big urban centers, and there are still so many people who can’t find a single room to live in.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 17, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Y2Y is a student-run overnight homeless shelter for minors. In fact, Y2Y is a shelter for young adults aged 18 to 24.

Citing the success of the Harvard University Dining Services workers’ 2016 strike, workers at Tufts University joined the regional union representing Harvard dining workers, UNITE HERE Local 26.
Local 26 announced the dining workers’ decision to unionize Tuesday morning. Though workers have filed for a unionization election through the National Labor Relations Board, they are asking Tufts to immediately recognize the union. In the event that the university agrees to recognize the union, the election will not be necessary.
“We would prefer to get down to a real conversation right away and without delay, and that's why workers have been making that demand on the administration,” Michael Kramer, the organizing director of the food service division of Local 26, said.
Though he could not provide exact numbers, Kramer said “an overwhelming majority” of dining workers supported the effort to unionize.
“We think the right thing for them to do would be to recognize the union, listen to the voice of the workers, and begin focusing on negotiating a contract,” Kramer said.
Both Kramer and Patricia O’Brien, a Tufts dining employee and union organizer, said that HUDS employees inspired Tufts workers’ efforts.
“After the Harvard strike, and what we saw there, and how they won everything, and how they worked together as a group, it really inspired me,” O’Brien said.
Kramer added that members of Local 26 on other campuses were inspired by Harvard’s solidarity with workers at Northeastern when they “were on the verge of the strike.”
“The local 26 members of Harvard were right there with them, because that experience resonated. They had been through it. And I think we're going to see the same thing at Tufts,” Kramer said.
In response to criticisms from dining workers, Tufts spokesperson Patrick Collins wrote in an emailed statement that the University values the “important work” of its dining employees.
“We respect the rights of employees to seek an election to decide for themselves whether unionization is in their best interests,” Collins wrote. “We think it’s fair that all workers have the opportunity to cast a vote regardless of their position on the question, and we will respect the election’s outcome.”

Wholesome Fresh, a casual restaurant-convenience store hybrid that started in Rhode Island, opened its doors to Harvard Square Thursday morning in the property formerly occupied by Market in the Square.
This is Wholesome Fresh’s second location; it started in Newport, R.I. Britni M. Price, an employee at the new location, said she was optimistic about the new location, calling Harvard Square a “gold mine.” She noted that this store is bigger than the one in Rhode Island.
Price said that what makes Wholesome Fresh unique is its dedication to offering fresh food on a daily basis. The store is “geared towards fresh deli, everything's made to order, and the menu changes everyday.”
“Most of the things we have have no artificial ingredients,” she added.
Denise Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was impressed by the store’s warm atmosphere.
“I just toured it and it’s really very nice,” Jillson said. “Based on what I have seen they have exceeded my expectations. The food looks beautiful.”
Brandon Wang ’18 said he was excited to see that the new store offered similar goods as Market in the Square, the popular store it replaced. He said he believes the organic options—which he said are probably better in quality than Market’s offerings—differentiate it from Market, which he considered more geared towards college students.
“The food is probably a little better. Definitely an upgrade on the food. It’s just a change in environment,” Wang said. “A lot of the same people working there which was nice to see.”
Market shuttered in Nov. 2017 after the Middlesex County Sheriff's Department seized the property. The seizure resulted from the deli's inability to pay rent, Jillson said at the time.

As relieved seniors turn in their Social Studies theses—a requirement for the concentration—juniors are just gearing up for their capstone project and some say they underestimated the commitment such a project would entail.
Faculty and staff say that the Social Studies’ mandatory thesis is an intense project that likely  requires summer research, leading some upperclassmen to worry about lost opportunities during their junior summer.
Bonnie M. Talbert, assistant director of studies for freshmen and sophomores in Social Studies, wrote in an email that the thesis is the centerpiece of the Social Studies curriculum.
“Our entire program is structured to guide and prepare students to write their thesis,” Talbert wrote.
Social Studies Peer Concentration Advisor Christian T. Kardish ’18 agreed.
“The whole concentration is basically developed around this project,” Kardish said.
While most students conduct research over the summer, Social Studies has no formal requirement for such an undertaking. However, Talbert wrote she advises students to “plan” for it.
“I generally tell students to plan to do some research over the summer before their senior year, so that when they begin their classes in the Fall they are prepared to start writing their thesis,” Talbert wrote.
Anya B. Bassett, director of studies in Social Studies, concurred in an email.
“We encourage students to apply for funding so that they can devote at least part of their summer to their theses,” Bassett wrote.
Bassett said she encourages students to work over the summer because funding is more readily available, and because on average, students who research over the summer have more “time and energy” and thus “write better theses.”
Talbert also said that many students’ topics demand “off-site” research.
But while students acknowledge they were warned about this expectation, some said they hadn’t anticipated how it would limit opportunities for internships.
“It’s different being told, ‘yeah, you’re probably gonna have to do some research over the summer,’ and realizing, [every internship] wants me to commit 10 weeks, and I don’t really have 10 weeks in addition to doing the four weeks that you have to commit for most research grants,” Dominique J. Erney ’19 said.
“[Summer research] is emphasized, and students might feel pressured to give up other summer opportunities,” Kardish said.
Devontae Freeland ’19 said that the expectation of summer research also “restricted” study abroad opportunities.
“I think being restricted to do research for a topic and limiting the ability to do summer study abroad programs, and needing to be in residence mid-year during the writing process, is really something that's making me rethink my plans for junior and senior year,” Freeland said.
As a result, Freeland is “reconsidering” his choice of concentration.
“Realizing that writing the thesis directly conflicts with the other things I want to do in terms of extracurricular commitments and my job has made me reconsider whether social studies is the right path for me,” Freeland said.
While Erney will be able to research and intern simultaneously this summer, she said many students are in the same position as Freeland.
“I know of people who are considering dropping Social Studies or are making plans to drop it because they decided that that was just not what they wanted to spend their time doing this summer,” Erney said.
Summer research may not be necessary for all students though. Some, including Kardish and Nuha Saho ’18, avoided summer research altogether. Kardish and Saho said that students are on “different timetables”.
“Looking back at it now, I was never actually behind. I assumed that I was, because I assumed that a lot of students were doing research over the summer,” Saho said. “But people were pretty much in the same place.”
However, though Kardish said he “managed it in the end,” he called fall and winter break research in Social Studies “stressful” and said he “felt that I was behind”.
Bassett acknowledged the “dilemma,” but said the thesis was worth the trouble.
“We are aware that spending time doing thesis research may make it harder to take long internships, and we are sympathetic to the dilemmas faced by students who want to do both. But we also think that writing a thesis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Bassett wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid fears that Harvard students are losing interest in the humanities, administrators hosted events at a two-week Advising Fortnight—meant to help freshmen plan their academic futures—that in part highlighted fields of study like English, Classics, and Romance Languages and Literatures.
Thirty-one of the 67 events included in this year’s iteration of Advising Fortnight—an annual program—focused on concentrations that fall under the arts and humanities umbrella. Harvard boasts 50 concentrations in total.
Some administrators who oversee humanities-related fields of study said they felt pressure this year to attract more students to their Advising Fortnight events—and to their concentrations—given falling levels of undergraduate interest. Traditional humanities fields of study like English and Comparative Literature have seen marked declines in the number of concentrators across the past decade.
Naomi A. Weiss, director of undergraduate studies for the Classics concentration, left nothing up to chance. She said she did a lot of “outreach” to augment her concentration’s Advising Fortnight event this week.
“I emailed every student whose name was on one of various lists of people who might possibly be interested in classics,” Weiss said. “We have to make quite an act about it, to bring people in.”
At the Classics Advising Fortnight event Tuesday, current concentrators gave public speeches touting what they called the concentration’s numerous practical benefits. Classics concentrator Richard F. Dunn ’19 said he feels he has an advantage in applying to law school with his Classics degree.
Weiss agreed, adding that analytical skills developed in the concentration are often immensely useful outside of the field.
Professor Stephen Mitchell, director of undergraduate studies for the Committee on Folklore and Mythology, seemed less stressed about the need to recruit students than did Weiss. He noted his concentration has an average of 14 to 18 students at any given time.
“We know that we have the opportunity to really help people with their time at Harvard, and we’re kind of eager to build the most out of this very precious commodity of being at Harvard for four years,” Mitchell said. “We’re eager to recruit people in that sense. It’s kind of a missionary zeal, not a survivalist kind of concern about being cut.”
Mitchell acknowledged Folk and Mythology can have trouble attracting undergraduates. He said people sometimes “scoff” at the concentration’s title, at one point prompting Folk and Mythology affiliates to develop a guide for “horrified” parents.
And Mitchell—like Weiss—has developed strategies to cope. When seeking to convince students and parents ambivalent about the concentration, Mitchell said he highlights individual student success stories.
“It’s going to take a certain amount of initiative to be successful in [folk and myth],” Mitchell said, adding there is no rigid course plan for concentrators. “We think people who do it really come away with substantial critical tools.”
But Mitchell has no immediate plans to touch the concentration’s at-times off-putting title.
There’s a “certain kind of clientele that kind of likes the nerdiness of it,” he said.
Concentrator Ailie F. Kerr ’18 said her parents were supportive of her decision to concentrate in Folk and Mythology.
“People get really worried about the employability of their degree, and I think that people worry about that too much,” Kerr said. “[My parents] said exactly what I said, if you have a degree from Harvard, who cares what it’s in.”
Kathy Richman, director of undergraduate studies for Romance Languages and Literatures, said she feels pressure to attract concentrators for a different reason. She said she is always looking for more students because she wants to share her love for the discipline.
Nonetheless, she—like Weiss, like Dunn, like Mitchell—could not resist deflating the common myth that humanities majors learn nothing useful in a practical sense and cannot find jobs after graduation.
“Employers are looking for people who can express themselves well, work well… with others,” Richman said. “And those are all things that you learn in the humanities.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 6, 2018 at 1:30 p.m.
Harvard’s Math Department has hired a woman as a senior professor for the second time in its history, ending a six-year streak in which the department boasted not a single woman of that rank.
University of California at Berkeley math professors Lauren K. Williams ’00 and Denis Auroux will join Harvard’s math department as senior faculty at the start of the next academic year, Department Chair Curtis T. McMullen said in an interview last week.
Auroux has served as a math professor at UC Berkeley since 2009 and has published articles on subjects ranging from “symplectic submanifolds” to “Lefschetz pencils.” Williams, a former math concentrator, won a tenured associate professorship at UC Berkeley in 2013—and a full tenured professor position there in 2016—and has written extensively about cluster algebras and tropical geometry.
“It’s a really fantastic place to be, so I’m really looking forward to it,” Auroux said in an interview Thursday.
Williams fondly recalled her experiences at Harvard, both as a student and as an assistant professor.
“I spent four amazing years as an undergraduate at Harvard 1996-2000 (I was in Pennypacker and Pforzheimer) and another three years at Harvard as a Benjamin Pierce Assistant professor following my PhD,” she wrote in an email. “The students and faculty at Harvard are exceptional, and I am really looking forward to rejoining the vibrant intellectual life there.”
As senior math professors at Harvard, Williams and Auroux automatically earn tenure and will be expected to conduct research. The math department’s last female senior professor was Sophie Morel, who joined the University in 2009 but left for Princeton three years later.
Math professor Peter B. Kronheimer, who served as department chair before McMullen, wrote in an emailed statement Thursday that he is “thrilled” about the department’s “successful” recruitment efforts.
“Lauren and Denis are researchers at the very top of their respective fields, and will open up new areas for our department,” Kronheimer wrote. “Their presence at Harvard will be a real boost for the mathematical sciences.”
McMullen wrote in an emailed statement that Kronheimer—who stepped down from the chairship in July 2017—played a key role in convincing Williams and Auroux to come to Harvard. Across the past few years, math department administrators have taken several steps to improve their recruitment of female candidates at the faculty and graduate student levels.
The department has offered tenured professorships to at least three women in roughly the past decade and, in the 2016-2017 academic year, debuted two new programs explicitly designed to recruit women.
These efforts follow a long history of gender imbalance in the department. Current and former undergraduate and graduate students affiliated with the math department—including both women and men—have said the department’s lack of women in senior faculty positions made them feel uncomfortable and negatively affected their experiences and performance in the classroom.
In the wake of the hiring of Williams and Auroux, though, some department faculty and students said they feel more optimistic for the future of Harvard math.
Math professor Robin Gottlieb—who is not tenured and thus does not count as a senior professor—wrote in an emailed statement that she knew Williams as an undergraduate. Gottlieb wrote she remembers  working with Williams to organize a Women in Math brunch for female students in the department.
“I am truly delighted that Lauren Williams will be joining the mathematics department,” Gottlieb wrote. “She’s a spectacular research mathematician, a wonderful teacher, an excellent speaker, and a great community member.”
Amanda K. Glazer ’18 and Meena K. Boppana ’16, two of the founders of the student organization Gender Inclusivity in Mathematics, said they believe Williams’s hiring marks a significant breakthrough for the math department.
“I’m obviously thrilled about it,” Glazer said. “It’s really great because I feel like it’s been a long time coming, and I know the department and the administration have been working super hard to try and get a female faculty member.”
Glazer recently sent a survey to math students at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, and MIT to gauge student opinion on, in part, issues of gender parity. The survey results revealed that 26 percent of Harvard female math concentrators who chose to respond reported deciding not to take a math course due to concerns over “gender imbalance” at least once during their time at the College. More than 80 percent of women math concentrators answered the survey.
Glazer said she is glad the math department hired a senior female professor before she graduates and leaves the College come May.
“I’ve just been really happy to see, over my past few years, some change,” Glazer said. “I really hope that this is an indicator of even more change, that hopefully they’ll be able to acquire even more female faculty members and that that will have, I’m sure, positive effects on the percentage of concentrators that are women.”
“It’s really awesome to see it finally come to fruition,” she added.
Boppana said she thinks Williams’s appointment will have both short-term and long-term impacts on Harvard math.
“I think that just the presence of having a female role model in a high place is going to have very strong effects on the entire culture of the math department,” she said.
Math concentrator Jennifer Hu ’18 said she can’t wait to see what Williams accomplishes at Harvard.
“I think it’s great news, and I’m really excited to see what research she brings to Harvard and what she ends up doing here,” she said.
Williams’s hiring brings the University in line with peers like MIT, Yale, Princeton, and Brown; until now, Harvard was the only institution among this group whose math department lacked a single female tenured faculty member.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
UPDATED: April 6, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Lauren K. Williams '00 won a tenured professorship at University of California at Berkeley in 2016. To clarify, she won a tenured associate professorship at UC Berkeley in 2013, and earned a tenured full professorship at the school in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard’s second unionization election fast approaching, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 sent an email to affiliates Thursday listing resources Harvard already provides absent a bargaining unit—sparking intense backlash from some union advocates.
The election, slated to take place April 18 and 19, will determine whether eligible graduate and undergraduate students can collectively bargain with Harvard. In the run-up to the vote, University administrators have walked a delicate line in communications to students: never openly declaring Harvard’s official position, but instead issuing repeated pleas that students read up on the issues and turn out to vote come April.
Unionization advocates have shown no such restraint, instead openly advertising the benefits of a union. Members of pro-union advocacy group Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers have particularly argued unionization would grant students a collective voice, enabling them to fight for the rights of international graduate students—which they say are under threat in the era of Donald Trump—and to call for reforms to the University’s processes for handling sexual harassment and assault allegations.
Garber’s email, like past missives, toed the line. But several resources he highlighted in the message appeared to target exactly these two pro-union arguments.
For example, Garber pointed to the work of the University’s Title IX officers. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences added an additional Title IX officer earlier this year.
“Please know that these resources are available to all students now,” he wrote. “They are not contingent on classification as an ‘employee.’”
Garber also mentioned two University resources specifically designated for Harvard’s international students: the Harvard International Office and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic. He added the University has worked “tirelessly, often behind the scenes” to advocate for graduate students on Capitol Hill, fighting measures like the proposed tax on tuition grants—later erased from the final Republican-backed tax bill.
April’s election marks the second time eligible Harvard graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants will head to the polls. The University’s first unionization election, held in Nov. 2016, turned up more votes against unionization than in favor—but HGSU-UAW challenged that result, sparking a roughly year-long legal battle with the University.
The back-and-forth—which saw the overturning of the results of the first election, three rulings by the regional and national iterations of the National Labor Relations Board, and two separate appeals—ultimately led to the NLRB’s Dec. 2017 ultimatum that Harvard must hold a second election.
Garber’s Thursday email triggered the latest skirmish in the long-simmering saga.
Several pro-union graduate students took strong exception to Garber’s message. HGSU-UAW organizer Sam Klug wrote in an email that Garber’s message misrepresents and overestimates campus resources currently available to graduate students.
“Provost Garber's suggestion that Harvard's administration is doing as well as it possibly can to address issues that matter to students just does not line up with students' experience,” Klug wrote. “It's time for all of us to have a seat at the table.”
In the email, Garber wrote graduate students already weigh in on major administrative decisions sans a union via “elected student government” bodies. On campus, Harvard’s graduate students are represented by the Graduate Student Council, the Harvard Graduate Council, and their counterparts at each of the schools.
“Harvard students, individually and through elected student government, have long worked together with faculty and administrators to extend and improve student services,” Garber wrote. “Their collaborative efforts began well before paid organizers from the United Auto Workers came to our campuses.”
“We value these partnerships and look forward to building upon the progress we have made,” he added.
GSC Natural Sciences representative and HGSU-UAW organizer Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email that Garber’s missive overstated the Graduate Student Council’s ability to advocate for students.
“As someone who served on the GSC for 6 years, it hasn't been a very effective avenue for student input on issues like pay and healthcare,” Nicoludis wrote. “Neither the 1.5% pay raise of last year nor the 3% pay raise of this year were discussed with the GSC prior to the Dean’s announcement email to all of GSAS.”
Some Harvard workers also took issue with Garber’s email. John Perich, a representative for the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, criticized Garber’s assertion that, should the election go the union’s way, “each school’s dean and other leaders would be legally prohibited from working directly with individual students or with student government on these matters.”
"[The] HUCTW agreement spells out areas where employees and managers have the ability to make arrangements based on department needs,” Perich wrote. “So Harvard already has experience with a union contract that grants significant department-level flexibility.” HUCTW is the largest union on campus, representing approximately 5,000 of the University’s 6,000 unionized employees. Of Harvard’s nine extant labor unions, only HUCTW includes this type of provision in their agreement with the University.
In response to criticisms from HGSU-UAW and HUCTW, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that Garber’s email “focused on incontrovertible facts” about unionization.
"Unlike union organizers, the University is legally prohibited from making unsubstantiated promises about what life with or without a union would be like for students,” Cowenhoven wrote. “The Provost's message therefore focused on incontrovertible facts about what it means to have a union, including the fact that all students in the unit would be covered by a single contract, the fact that students would pay dues or an equivalent fee, the fact that students cannot opt out of representation, and the fact that students would no longer have access to School-level channels for addressing certain matters.”
Cowenhoven also reiterated a message common to Garber’s email and to previous statements from administrators—an entreaty that all eligible students show up to the polls on April 18 and 19.
“We encourage students to carefully consider whether unionization is in their best interest and, most importantly, go to the polls and vote on April 18 and 19," Cowenhoven wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, visited Harvard Thursday to speak about how she seeks to live with both justice and forgiveness in front of a hundreds-strong crowd in Sanders Theatre.
Denhollander earned national attention after she spoke out against Nassar—and inspired scores of women to do the same. Since Denhollander’s denunciations, over 250 women have publicly accused Nassar of sexual abuse. Nassar underwent a seven-day sentencing hearing in late Jan. 2017; across that week alone, more than 150 girls and women stepped up to the microphone in Nassar’s Michigan courtroom to share stories of sexual mistreatment at the hands of the former doctor.
Nassar was ultimately sentenced to up to 175 years in prison for his proven and repeated abuse of young female gymnasts across decades.
At the event Thursday, Denhollander said she operates “within a worldview that is distinctly Christian in nature.” She also outlined her definitions of justice and forgiveness according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary.
She began with the definition of “just,” which she asserted contains five components: “having a basis in or conforming to fact or reason, conforming to a standard of correctness, faithful to an original, acting or being in conformity with what is morally upright or good, and being what is merited or deserved.”
“All of these require and appeal to a standard,” Denhollander said to the Sanders Theatre audience of more than 200.
Denhollander called forgiveness, on the other hand, a “personal internal response.”
“Justice is not dependent, one way or another, on how I respond. Because it is an outward standard,” she said. “Justice is not in opposition to forgiveness. Rather, justice is the foundation for forgiveness.”
Because justice exists as an objective standard, Denhollander said she is not dependent on societal opinion or the ruling of a jury—regardless of Nassar’s final sentencing.
In the end, Denhollander said, her path to healing has stemmed from within.
“Being able to speak the truth, and grieve the way you were damaged in ways that are non-destructive, is really the first step to healing,” she added.
The event Thursday was co-sponsored by several campus religious organizations, including Harvard College Faith and Action. The Undergraduate Council, Harvard College Women’s Center, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response also co-sponsored the event.
“The purpose of the Veritas Forum is to get people to think,” said Michelle N. Odonkor ’18, who emceed the event. “And so I hope Christians were challenged, and I hope non-Christians were also challenged. I hope that everybody can critically assess what they believe, why they believe it, and have these tough conversations.”
Several attendees said they appreciated the clarity of Denhollander’s thought process, as well as her openness in speaking about her personal experiences.
“Narrowing it down and finding the common thread in all of [the dictionary definitions of “just”] about measuring up to one standard, and how you can’t have justice without having that one standard, really rang true to me,” said Esther J. Um ’21, who attended the event. “It gave me a type of rhetoric to express what I was feeling before.”
In an interview before the event, Denhollander said she is still waiting to see whether movements like #MeToo have had a lasting effect.
“There’s always an ebb and flow to where the spotlight is,” she said. “Right now, there’s still a lot of outrage, but most of it is directed outside of people’s communities. Evangelicals are plenty happy to talk about MSU and Penn State, and the Catholic Church is great when they talk about MSU and Penn State, but they’re not so great when they talk about what happened in their church and Evangelicals are not very good at speaking out against their own community.”
“That really is the test of how much someone cares and how much they’ve changed—what they do if it happens in their own community,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took extra innings, an extra day due to a weather delay, and a great deal of resilience, but the Harvard baseball team is back in the Beanpot final.
The “Bad Boys” Crimson squad rolled into Brighton Baseball Field on a freezing Wednesday night and took down Boston College, 7-4, on junior outfielder P.J. Robinson’s three-run homer in the eleventh.
A year after losing to the Eagles (9-17, 4-8 ACC) in the annual four-team tournament final, Harvard (10-13, 1-2 Ivy League) exacted revenge in this year’s semifinal match, getting out to an early lead and overcoming multiple BC comebacks. With the win, the Crimson will play Northeastern, which beat UMass on a grand slam, for the crown on Tuesday, April 17.
Robinson, the Crimson’s Male Breakout Athlete of the Year last year, played hero for the visiting Harvard squad in extras against a strong Eagles team.
With the game knotted at four in the top of the eleventh, junior first baseman Pat McColl and sophomore outfielder Jake Suddleson started the rally by getting on base with one out. Robinson then took advantage of junior BC righty Thomas Lane’s poor command and sent an 0-1 pitch sailing over the wall to give the Crimson a 7-4 lead.
“I got a fastball away and just managed to get my bat to it,” Robinson said. “[The game] ended up going to extras and it was good to get the game over with.”
The duo of Robinson and McColl was potent all night long. Each garnered four-hit days, combining for an 8-for-11 performance that has come to be expected since the two emerged as Harvard’s offensive leaders last season.
“Pat [McColl] had a huge day, it’s always good when you can be that guy who can step up and come up big for your team,” said sophomore two-way player Hunter Bigge, who got the start on the mound against the Eagles and held BC scoreless through four innings of work.
McColl went 4-for-5 with two runs scored and has a team-leading 23 RBIs to complement a .272 average on the year. Robinson hit 4-for-6 at the dish and drove in the winning runs. He appears to be heating up halfway through the season, a good sign for his comeback from a concussion. The Melbourne, Fla. native is now hitting .288.
“We have [P.J. Robinson] back from a concussion, and it’s great to see him back in his form of just raking every single time he’s on the field,” Bigge said.
McColl and Robinson’s heroics were needed on a night when BC staged multiple comebacks to prolong the game on a freezing night in Brighton. First down 3-0 after the first inning, the Eagles tied the game at three in the seventh, and after the Crimson tallied a run in the top of the eighth, plated a run in the bottom of the ninth to force extras.
The blown leads, however, did nothing to dampen the atmosphere in the Harvard dugout.
“We were laughing, just trying to stay positive throughout the whole thing,” Bigge said. “It was freezing outside, it was a close game against a really good team. It was a really disorganized situation coming into the game, and we were kind of just like, ‘alright, let’s not care about anything, have a positive attitude, have a smile on our face.’”
Especially as the semifinal was originally scheduled for Tuesday night, the postponement derailed many student-athlete schedules. In addition, as Robinson noted, the Crimson squad is very much in the Beanpot but is also focused on Ivy League play, which continues this weekend against Penn.
The combination of light-hearted play and a collective team resilience contributed to the big team win against Boston College, ranked 104th on the RPI Division I Baseball rankings as of April 4. The Crimson, with its upset, jumped 37 spots to 153rd. Harvard’s next opponent, Northeastern, slots in at a cool 13th place.
“Collectively, we had a lot of resilience, which is something we’re trying to do as a team, build an identity around,” said Robinson on his team’s play under the circumstances. “It was really good to see that everyone was in the game, everyone was cheering on their teammates. It was really a good collective team win.”
Senior third baseman Jake Forte and freshman shortstop Buddy Mrowka collected RBIs for the Crimson. Senior Matt Rothenberg also collected a hit and an RBI in his pinch-hit appearance in the eighth inning.
A big part of Harvard’s success was its pitching, which did enough to keep the Crimson in the game and the Eagles off the board. The pitching staff collectively held BC to just six hits while the Harvard offense got 16 knocks.
Bigge, a utility player capable of pitching and playing in the field, got the start on the mound and went four clean innings, striking out two, walking two, and only giving up two hits.
“This was my first time pitching in about three weeks, and it was definitely good to get a good start this week,” Bigge said. “It’s been a fun season on the mound.”
Junior outfielder John MacLean continued his newfound hotstreak on the mound, coming into a jam in the bottom of the sixth and getting a crucial strikeout in a bases-loaded situation to preserve a 3-1 lead. Freshman righty Jack Mahala pitched tossed 1.1 no-hit relief innings and sophomore righty Grant Stone mowed down the Eagles hitters in the bottom of the eleventh to get the save.
The Crimson staked itself to a 3-0 lead on RBI singles by Forte and Mrowka, while junior center fielder Ben Skinner got it started with a leadoff single, coming around to score on a wild pitch.
Before the semifinal match against Boston College, Skinner said the Harvard team hoped to bring the “Bad Boys” moniker into not just the Ivy League, but to the rest of Boston as well. The Bad Boys of Boston now look to bring their swagger into the Beanpot finals, which, originally set for next Tuesday, has been postponed to Tuesday, April 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, all four of Harvard’s crews will take to the water to battle opponents in a full slate of competitive racing.
In the case of the No. 13 ranked men’s lightweight crew, this weekend’s races will mark the beginning of the spring dual season. After strong performances at the National Championships last year, in which the second-ranked Crimson took the overall team’s points title and the varsity with no coxswain gold medal, the rowers of Harvard will take on Cornell and Penn on Saturday in Ithaca, N.Y. They will then plunge their oars into the Charles on Sunday for a matchup against Columbia and Georgetown. Cornell, in particular, will come to the line as defending national champions.
“I respect the teams and you never want to underestimate your opponents, especially in the lightweight league where everything is so tight,” Dupuis said. “The races themselves can be won over seats, so you always have to bring your A-game to every single race. The lightweight league is always competitive almost among all the boats, so we have to be performing at the highest level.”
Especially after an intensive winter and spring training campaign, the lightweight rowers will be raring to get off the line in a competitive atmosphere.
“All the hard work from the fall and winter builds for the spring, so I think everyone on the team is exciting to get racing,” Dupuis said. “That’s why we do this whole thing, so I think all the boats are really excited to show off the work that they’ve put in over the many, many months.”
Meanwhile, the No. 6 women’s lightweight crew team will look to rebound after last weekend’s losses, in which the team was upended by both No. 8 Georgetown and Bates. Radcliffe fell in all three varsity races as the Hoyas captured the Class of 2004 Cup.
This Saturday, the Black and White will take on Princeton at Lake Carnegie in New Jersey in which the Class of 1999 Cup will be on the line. The waters will splash with the oars from crews of seven of the Ivy League programs  Last year on the Charles, Radcliffe’s first varsity boat edged the Tiger’s crew by a mere 1.7 seconds.
At the same time, the men’s heavyweight program will be traveling to Providence, R.I., to battle Brown after easing past Cornell and George Washington last weekend, including a finish in the varsity eight that was 10 seconds faster than the rest of the field’s. The Bears enter the contest after conceding the Albert Cup to Yale last weekend.
More class cups will be on the line for the No. 16 Radcliffe heavyweight crew. After being edged by Brown by three seconds in the varsity eight last weekend, the team will join its lightweight counterparts on Lake Carnegie and will vie for the Class of 1975 Cup in the morning against Princeton and Cornell and then return to the water in the afternoon to try to capture the Class of 1984 Plaque against Princeton, Dartmouth, and Penn. The Tigers enter the races as favorites after winning the Class of 1975 Cup the past four years and maintaining a perfect record in the Class of 1984 Plaque.
Sophomore coxswain Katherine Paglione said that the team is focused on the technical workings of its stroke going into the races on Saturday. Paglione said that the team will focus on each race individually and will not think too much about the class cups.
“We’re focusing purely on that first race against Princeton and Cornell and once we get that result, we move on to the next,” Paglione said. “So, one piece at a time, and then one thing leading up before the race is how we’re going about it.”
The confluence of many Ivy League teams early in the season also provides a unique opportunity for the crew and will guarantee a week of intense rivalry across the conference.
“There’s going to be a lot of things to watch, a lot of things to distract you from what you’re trying to do, so I think how our team goes about it, we don’t mention the race is this cup or that cup,” Paglione said. “We’re just trying to get the best margins we can and the best results we can against the teams. So for us, it feels like another race, but it will be a challenge to keep our heads in the boat and focus on what we need to do because it’s almost a mini championship in that way midway through the season.”

Sunday marked Harvard's annual Holi celebrations. Luckily for all the color-flinging participants, the rain didn't set in until later this week.
The former Market in the Square did what we all do when our parents are about to visit—clean up and make everything look “Wholesome and Fresh” (as this meme so aptly put it).
Harvard could always use more mental health-centric initiatives, but in the midst of midterms, cold rain, and general gloom, Mental Health Matters Week, with its petting zoo and free food events, came at a particularly good time. Shouts out to this little guy for brightening our day.
Many of you will be sad to learn that you missed out on the revelry (or wild people-watching) of last weekend’s Anime Boston Convention.
You can blame Neptune (see above) for this stormy week.
