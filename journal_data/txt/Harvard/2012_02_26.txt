After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Music Department celebrated the recent renovation of Paine Hall Friday with a performance by a string quartet of a piece composed by John Knowles Paine, Harvard’s first music professor and the namesake of the music building.
The concert—given by the Portland String Quartet—followed two short talks on the history of music at Harvard.
Daniel D. Sedgwick '03, a teaching fellow for Music 150, said he was impressed by both the concert and the renovations.
“[A string quartet] is a marriage of four people, and it's really hard to make that work,” he said.
As a member of the music department, Sedgwick said that he appreciated the renovations, especially the restoration of two grand pianos and the changes made to practice space in the basement.
“Sound proofing the practice rooms was a big improvement,” he said.
The Portland String Quartet played a string quartet written by Walter H. Piston '24, a longtime Harvard professor, as well as Paine's String Quartet in D major.
The group debuted Paine's string quartet—composed in 1855 when Paine was just 16—for the first time last fall, but Friday's concert was the first performance of Paine's piece in his namesake hall.
“To play [Piston's] work here at Harvard, and Paine's work from another century was a very special feeling,” said Ronald Lantz, a violonist in the quartet.
Robert E. Olson Jr. '70, the chief architetct of Paine Hall’s renovation, said that the primary goal of the renovation was to improve the building’s overall utility while keeping the historic performance hall intact.
“The hall has its own unique acoustic, and our role was not to try and change it,” Olson said.
Lantz appreciated the acoustics in the hall, which were not altered during the renovation.
“It has a resonance that is really fun to play in,” Lantz said.
Paine Hall, which was constructed as Harvard's first music building in 1914, reopened this semester after more than a year of renovations, including improved sound proofing for basement practice rooms and better heating and cooling.

Toscano, a neighborhood Italian restaurant in Beacon Hill, will open a second location in Harvard Square this fall, replacing Café of India at 52 Brattle Street.
The restaurant serves northern Italian cuisine, including traditional, homemade pastas, pizzas, seafood, and a newer vegetarian menu.
According to Richard J. Cacciagrani, managing partner at Toscano, the restaurant differentiates itself by always using fresh ingredients to prepare “classic” dishes.
Toscano’s chefs hope to build on a core menu from their Beacon Hill branch. Yet the new location may focus on pizza and pastas in the future to cater to a different clientele in Harvard Square, Cacciagrani said.
Simple dishes range from about 16 to 18 dollars.
Cacciagrani hopes the state will finalize the transfer of Café of India’s liquor license to Toscano by the end of April. Construction wil begin in May, and the restaurant is tentatively slated to open in November.
After a complete renovation of the interior, the restaurant will feature chandeliers, old walnut floors, reclaimed wood doors, and hand painted glass to replicate the warm, rustic atmosphere of old Tuscany.
In addition to restaurant seating, Tuscano will house a casual bar and café area. The restaurant can host a total of 119 customers.
Toscano’s Beacon Hill location caters primarily to neighborhood residents and professionals, but it also attracts customers from the nearby Emerson College. At Harvard Square, the restaurant also hopes to draw students and their parents with its unique offerings.
Although Cambridge has numerous restaurants that serve Italian food, Harvard Square currently does not have a comparable, upscale Italian restaurant, said Cacciagrani.
With its close-knit, business community, Harvard could be a “good anchor for our business,” he said.
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was glad to welcome Toscano to the Square and described their simple cuisine as “delicious.”
The original restaurant was founded in 1984 in Beacon Hill. The current owner, David F. D’Alessandro, a former CEO of John Hancock Financial Services, breathed new life into the space when he bought Toscano five years ago.
The owner of Café of India could not be reached for comment.

Deafening applause filled Sanders Theater as nine-time Grammy Award winning musician John Legend received the Harvard Foundation’s annual “Artist of the Year” Award at the 27th Cultural Rhythms celebration Saturday.
Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter, who introduced Legend and presented him with the award before the show’s finale, said “the incomparable” Legend was selected for the award because of both his musical and humanitarian accomplishments. After receiving his award, Legend made a short speech to the crowd praising the diversity of the event.
“The thing about diversity is that you see how much we’re alike, you see how much we’re connected,” he said. “This has been an amazing celebration of that.”
Legend also emphasized the need for access to quality education in America and around the world, urging Harvard students to remember to make affect positive change in the world.
“You guys have it all,” he told the crowd.  “To whom much is given, much is expected.  Take this education you have, this wonderful gift, do whatever you’re going to do in life, be successful at whatever you’re going to do in life, but don't forget to give back, don't forget to use these resources you have to make the world a better place.”
Cultural Rhythms, which consists of two different shows in the afternoon and evening, featured performances by over 60 different cultural groups. This year, Cultural Rhythms was directed by Carola A. Cintron-Arroyo '12 and Eric Lu '12.
Groups in the afternoon show were permitted to send two members to have a brief question-and-answer session with Legend. Representatives from each student group presented him with a rose.
Kuumba members, in turn, gave him the traditional scarf that they wear during their performances.
Legend, who also MC'd the event, asked the performers to give him a history of their dance, in addition to their name and concentration.
Cracking jokes and engaging with the audience, Legend performed an impromptu a capella segment of his hit song “Ordinary People” when a member of the Wushu performance group mentioned that it was her friend's birthday.
“According to my roast, I only have one song,” he said, before he began to sing. Legend also signed a dancer's notebook and another performer's shoe.
While Legend was the guest of honor, the student performance groups had no trouble holding the attention of the crowd during their varied cultural performances.
The student acts, which ranged from the impossible acrobatics and sword play of the Harvard Wushu Club to the soulful songs of Kuumba,  elicited enormous applause from the audience. After the finale, in which members from each group stood together on stage and performed different portions of their pieces, the audience and Legend gave the performers a standing ovation.
Alice Abracen '15, a student who attended the performance, said the show was “amazing.”
“It's amazing to see what students created,” she added. “I knew they were talented, but not that talented.”
Performers said that this year's Cultural Rhythms was a monumental success.
“The show was great,” said Albert J. Oh '13, who performed with the Harvard Breakers.  “We couldn't even hear the music because there was so much cheering going on.”
For Maricruz Rodriguez '12, the president of the Ballet Folklorico de las Americas, one highlight of the show was the opportunity to meet John Legend.
“It was such an honor,” Rodriguez said.  “His work, both humanitarian and musical, is very powerful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team used its strong defense to overcome early errors, extending its winning streak to three on Saturday in a 3-0 defeat of Sacred Heart.
Playing at home in the Malkin Athletic  Center, the Crimson (9-2, 3-2 EIVA) caught the conference foe Pioneers (4-11, 1-6 EIVA) on a three game losing streak. But Sacred Heart seemed undaunted by its recent losses at the outset.
The visitors capitalized off a number of unforced errors by the home team, taking an early 21-18 lead.  With Harvard on the brink of dropping the first set, junior setter Derek Jansma stepped up for the Crimson with a handful of clutch serves.
“That was huge,” said co-captain outside hitter Matt Jones. “To go down in the first game would have been huge. But Derek really carried us there in the end. [Freshman outside hitter] DJ [White] had some good blocks, but Derek set him up with some nice serves, and it made it hard for them.”
Jansma’s strong serves swung the momentum in Harvard’s favor.  The Crimson took the next six points, rallying from behind to win the first set, 25-22.
“The [first] game was much closer than it should have been because we made so many unforced errors,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said.  “Any team is going to make it close when you make that many unforced errors.”
Harvard never looked back. The Crimson took control of the match with its stalwart defense, holding the Pioneers to a .061 hitting percentage. The home team tallied 21 digs, six of those coming from White, while limiting its opponents to 11. More importantly, Harvard limited the errors that nearly cost it the first set.
“We really wanted to minimize the unforced errors on our side. That’s something we’ve been focusing on,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “If we gave them the chance to make the errors instead of making the errors first, we felt that the match would go our way.”
Harvard was able to control the net with its strong defensive play.  Sophomore outside hitter Nick Madden and freshman middle hitter Caleb Zimmick, a 6’9” freshman who is currently tenth in the nation with 1.23 blocks per game, tied for a match-high four blocks.
The Crimson went on to take the second set, 25-17, as Jones’s serve proved to be too much for the Sacred Heart to handle. Jones and White led Harvard with two service aces apiece.
The Pioneers found some energy late in the third set, pulling off a 7-2 run to cut the Crimson lead and bringing the match to 22-19.  But it was too little, too late. Harvard defended its home court, winning the final set, 25-22.
Although the Crimson won its third straight game, Baise thinks that they are some areas where his team can improve.
“I thought we played okay. This wasn’t our best outing,” Baise said.  “Anytime you can get a win in our league and get it in three games, we’re happy with that. We blocked really well. [Zimmick] did a great job and so did our outside guys.
“They had a pretty tough jump serve, and we didn’t handle it too well,” Baise continued. We have some teams coming up who are good at that so we need to get better at handling those. The back row defense and the serve receive are two things we’re going to focus on this week.”
Jones agreed that his team could have played better, but the team was happy to walk out of the Malkin Athletic  Center with a win.
“We were 2-2 in the league, and we knew a win today was important to keep us where we wanted to be in the standings,” said Jones. “Sacred Heart is the bottom of the league, and we thought they had some weakness we could exploit. We didn’t play our best match of the year, but we got a big, three-game win today.”
Harvard currently sits in third place in the eight-team conference. Next week, the team begins a six-game road trip, with three of those games on the West Coast.
The Crimson will try to extend its winning streak on Mar. 2 when Harvard travels to Northern Virginia in a rematch against conference opponent George Mason.
When the Crimson and the Patriots met on Feb. 10 in Cambridge, George Mason swept Harvard, 3-0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Entering the final weekend of the regular season, junior David Valek had scored two goals. After Saturday night, he had tripled this output, tallying two more against Clarkson at the Bright Hockey  Center for a total of six on the season.
Valek scored both the game-tying and game-winning goals, as the Crimson came back from a third-period deficit to defeat the Golden Knights, 3-2, ending the season with two straight road wins.
With playoff implications on the line, the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-8-11, 8-5-9 ECAC) earned a total of four points on the weekend, propelling itself into a third-place finish in the ECAC after beginning the weekend in fifth, thereby earning a first-round bye.
“The game really had a playoff feel to it right from the start,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “All game, I felt our effort was there…. It’s really a tremendous achievement for the players in the locker room, and I’m really proud of them.”
Harvard played a strong third period in its comeback, outshooting the Golden Knights, 16-10, as well withstanding a late charge by Clarkson (15-15-6, 9-9-4) with an empty net.
“They put a great scare in us in the end,” Donato said. “They just kept coming. [Sophomore goalie Raphael] Girard stood pretty tall there at the end for us.”
The Golden Knights were able to jump ahead with a two-goal lead thanks to a goal late in the first and another on a two-man advantage power-play early in the second, as a string of penalties killed any momentum for the home team.
But after junior Alex Fallstrom opened the scoring later in the second, the Crimson looked to be the stronger team.
Valek scored his first goal of the night early in the third after streaking up the left side of the ice across the blue line and firing a hard shot from the top of the circle that sailed right past Clarkson goalie Paul Karpowich. Assisting on the play was freshman Tommy O’Regan as well as Girard, who notched his first career assist while saving 27 of 29 shots on the night.
About five minutes later, Valek put Harvard up for good, scoring on a pass from O’Regan, who had skated through two defenders, sharply cutting back across the final defender before finding Valek open on the right across the net.
Playing in pain from a tough blocked shot the previous night, when he scored two goals as well, Valek was able to take advantage of his offensive tools once again.
“David’s got a great shot,” Donato said. “We’ve been preaching to him to try to use it more, and he couldn’t have picked a better time over this last weekend.”
Connecting twice in the third period, O’Regan and Valek provided an offensive spark that was not evident for most of the year.
“At this time of the year, it is really important to have other people step up,” Donato said. “That line was huge for us tonight”
For the most part, the first period was a fairly even affair. Both teams exchanged penalties early in the opening frame, but no goals were scored.
With under a minute remaining in the first, Golden Knight Nick Tremblay took a shot from the right point that was initially saved by Girard. But the puck bounced in front of the net, allowing freshman Kevin Tansey to net his first goal of the season.
Frustrations built late, as freshman defenseman Patrick McNally was called for interference, and concurrent roughing penalties were assessed to both junior Danny Biega and Clarkson forward Ben Sexton after tempers flared after the first period came to a close.
The visitors took advantage of a 5-3 man-advantage opportunity early in the second, as Sexton faked a shot from the left circle and passed down to Louke Oakley at the goal line, who was able to sneak in a shot from a tough angle past the right side of Girard to put Clarkson up 2-0.
But Harvard was able to turn around the momentum on its third man advantage of the night.
After the puck had bounced around the boards right of the net, junior Marshall Everson was able to poke it up to senior Alex Killorn, who then passed it up to Fallstrom who fired a shot from the right circle that cut the deficit for Harvard in half.
The Crimson was especially dominant on the face-off, almost doubling its opponents win total at a 40-22 margin.
“We struggled in the beginning of the year,” captain Ryan Grimshaw said. “We’ve been working on it a lot more in practice. It’s such a big part of the game just having that possession off the faceoff.”
While important for the Crimson in the standings, the victory also came on senior night, adding further significance.
“I think that to really give the credit where the credit is due, it’s the leadership of team and the captains and the senior group,” Donato said. “I’m very proud of the way they’ve handled all the adversity we’ve had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With one minute remaining at the Palestra on Saturday night, the Harvard women’s basketball team was in a 50-50 dead heat with Penn and at risk of losing its fourth game in five contests.
Fortunately, the team had junior wing Victoria Lippert.
Catching the ball at the top of the key, Lippert faced up, noticed the defense was playing off of her, and knocked down a three-pointer to give Harvard the lead. The teams then traded baskets in a frenetic final minute, but two free throws by sophomore Christine Clark eventually sealed a 57-53 victory for the Crimson.
“Victoria is a great 3-point, and…I’ve been trying to encourage her to take the open three more often,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She’s been hitting big shots during her whole career.”
On the night, Lippert led Harvard with 17 points. Junior Emma Golen netted 13 and Clark added 11.
The Crimson (14-11, 7-4 Ivy) and the Quakers (11-14, 4-7) battled back and forth in the first half with neither team establishing more than a five-point lead. At halftime, Penn led, 31-28, after shooting 7 of 13 from deep in the first period. According to Delaney-Smith, the Quakers took advantage of the extra guard they had on the court to spread the floor and get open three-point shots. In the second half, Harvard adjusted by playing a smaller lineup which held Penn to one of eight from behind the arc in the second half.
While the Quakers cooled down from three in the second period, the competition stayed extremely tight, though Harvard didn’t trail in the final 19 minutes of the game.
With nine minutes remaining, the Crimson opened up a seven-point advantage when junior Victoria Lippert converted an and-one opportunity to cap a 7-0 run. Penn answered right back with six unanswered points of its own on two conventional three-point plays, closing the gap to 44-43.
“We ended up getting beaten on the drive on two back-to-back three-point plays,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s just unfortunate. With a team like Penn in the middle of the pack, they are not playing for anything but pride. Now they have a put-your-head-down-and-go-to-the-hole kind of mentality.”
To stop the rally, Golen got to the line and sank a free throw before knocking down a three-pointer on the following possession. The Quakers rallied again though to knot the game at 48 going into the final media timeout with three minutes remaining. Two baskets later, the contest was tied at 50.
And that’s when Lippert sank a three-pointer to break the game’s final tie.
“The play had broken down, and she just saw that the defender was giving her too much space,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “We all had confidence in her. That shot gave us the spark we needed in the last minute and half.”
Berry extended the lead to four with a layup after Penn went one for two from the stripe on its end of the floor. A Quaker layup narrowed the difference to two, but sophomore Christine Clark made two free throws to put the game out of reach, sealing the 57-53 victory.
“We were completely confident in [Clark], 100 percent,” Berry said. “Towards the end of the game, she always hits those shots. I had no doubt she was going to sink those last two free throws.”
In the losing effort, Quaker sophomore Alyssa Baron led Penn with 20 points in the game. It was Baron’s third straight 20-point performance.
“She’s the kind of player you can’t stop from scoring,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we did a good job on her. She got some layups I wasn’t happy about, but for the most part we threw some defense at her that made her as uncomfortable as we could. I thought we stuck to our game plan against her.”
Harvard also had a tough time maintaining possession of the basketball on Saturday. A night after committing 24 turnovers, the team lost the ball 16 times against Penn.
“We are a kind of team that puts too much pressure on ourselves, and when we do that, we turn the ball over,” Delaney-Smith said. “I think this team has great potential, and I think the one area we have to continue getting better at is to stop putting so much pressure on ourselves.”
And despite having a larger team on the court for much of the game, the Crimson surrendered 16 offensive rebounds and only corralled four more total rebounds than the guard-oriented Quakers.
Still, the team played well enough to secure the victory and stay in the chase for second place in the Ivy League. Both Harvard and Yale went 1-1 on the weekend, meaning the Bulldogs are still a half game ahead in the league standings. If both teams were to win their remaining games, they would finish tied behind Princeton.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s quest for its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1994 began Saturday afternoon, as the Crimson hung on for an 11-9 win over Boston University in its season opener at Soldiers Field Lacrosse Stadium.
Entering the season ranked in the top 20 for the first time in over a decade, the No. 19 Crimson (1-0) relied on its balanced offensive attack to nab the win. Six Crimson players found the back of the net with co-captain Melanie Baskind leading the way with three goals on three shots
Junior Jennifer VanderMeulen, the reigning Ivy League scoring champion, added three goals on six shots, while senior Jess Halpern chipped in with two goals.
The Terriers (0-2) were led by junior attacker Danielle Etrasco. Etrasco, who is coming off a stellar sophomore campaign in which she finished eighth in the nation in goals per game, notched three scores and three draw controls. But besides Estrasco, the Terriers struggled to find the back of the net, as the rest of squad shot a combined 6 of 20.
Despite leading for the game’s final 39:21, the Crimson never managed to pull away. The underdog Terriers never fell behind by more than three points.
“It wasn’t our best effort,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “I thought BU played really hard.”
“It was definitely ugly,” Baskind echoed.
After junior Danielle Tetreault’s score with 16:43 to play put the Crimson ahead, 9-7, BU answered as Estrasco scored off a free-position shot to pull the visitors within one.
With less than 10 minutes to play and momentum on the Terriers’ side, BU won the draw control and set up its offense. The visitors passed the ball around the perimeter. But with 8:59 to go, Baskind picked off a Catie Tilton pass with one hand.
“I think [BU] misjudged how far away I was,” Baskind said. “I was surprised to see [the ball] in my stick.”
With the ball in her possession, Baskind pushed up the field, finding junior Micaela Cyr in transition. Cyr attacked the goal, drawing a foul on the Terriers’ Monica Baumgartner. The junior finished the ensuing free-position shot, putting the Crimson ahead by two with 8:54 to go.
Junior Danielle Tetreault won possession for the Crimson off the ensuing draw control, and Harvard elected to run the clock. After 90 seconds of working the ball around the perimeter, Tetreault attacked the goal and drew a foul but misfired on her free-position shot.
BU came up with possession and pushed it ahead to Etrasco, who drew a foul on sophomore Lauren Tomkinson in front of the net. Estrasco capitalized, beating rookie Kelly Weiss to pull the Terriers within one, 10-9 with 5:09 to play.
BU won the ensuing draw control, gaining possession and a chance to net the equalizer with just minutes remaining. The Terriers put the ball in Estasco’s stick, but the junior failed to step up in the clutch, turning the ball over with 4:08 to go. Tetreault picked up the ground ball, and the Crimson proceeded to milk the clock on the other end.
With less than 90 seconds to play, BU extended its defense in an attempt to cause a turnover, but the Crimson swung the ball to VanderMeulen, who broke down her defender and put the game away with a score with 1:12 to go.
BU had two more looks at the goal before the final buzzer but was unable to finish either, and the Crimson walked off the field with an 11-9 victory.
“We got away with a win,” Miller said.
After taking a 5-3 lead into the break, the Crimson extended its lead to 8-5 early in the second frame after Baskind notched her second and third goals of the game within 57 seconds.
“I’m glad she’s on our team,” Miller said.
The Terriers battled back, going on a 3-1 run over the next 16:10 to pull within one with 10:16 to go, setting up Baskind’s steal and Cyr’s score.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Across the gym, a group of blue and red clad Quakers’ fans chanted “I believe that we just won” as Penn’s players emerged from the visitors locker room with their hands lifted in the air.
It had been a long time since a visiting team walked out of Lavietes Pavilion victorious—27 games, in fact. But on Saturday night, the Quakers became the first team since Cornell on Feb. 19, 2010 to best the Crimson on its home court, bringing an end to the nation’s second-longest current home winning streak.
For the Crimson, the timing could not have been much worse. Not only did the loss come on Andrew Van Nest, Keith Wright, and Oliver McNally’s senior night, it also brought Penn (17-11, 9-2 Ivy) and Harvard (24-4, 10-2) even in the loss column heading into the final weekend of Ivy League play.
While a win on Saturday night would have guaranteed the Crimson at least a share of the Ancient Eight crown, Harvard now finds itself in a dead heat for the conference title and the Ivy League’s automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
With road games at Columbia and Cornell this coming weekend, Harvard still controls its own destiny. A pair of victories guarantees the Crimson at least a share of the Ivy title. But Harvard, which entered conference play as the Ivy League’s clear favorite, isn’t looking to settle for a piece of the title, like it did last season. If the Crimson is to punch its ticket to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946, it might just have to meet Zack Rosen and the Quakers again.
If both teams emerge from the rest of Ivy League play unscathed—and that’s a big if—Harvard would share the conference title with Penn, and the two teams would meet on a neutral court for a one-game playoff to determine the recipient of the conference’s automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
“I don’t like going out losing against somebody,” Curry said. “If we have a playoff with [Penn] that would be great, but if not, whatever happens, I’m fine with.”
Another matchup with the Quakers is far from a guarantee. Both squads are slated to close out the season with a number of difficult matchups. On Friday, the Crimson travels to 14-14 Columbia, which has gone 9-5 at its home Levien Gymnasium, and on Saturday Harvard faces 11-16 Cornell. Penn has the more difficult road ahead, as the Quakers host 8-21 Brown and 19-7 Yale and visit 16-11 Princeton.
“There’s a lot more to be played, a lot that’s going to play out before everything is over,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Certainly we have to go on the road and do our share of it.”
SIZE MATTERS
With the clock winding down, Amaker opted to have two freshmen on the court and the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year Keith Wright on the bench.
After scoring nine points and pulling down five rebounds in 27 minutes of play, Wright checked out of the game for good with the Crimson up by three and 3:46 remaining. The co-captain was replaced by rookie point guard Corbin Miller, who joined classmate Wes Saunders, junior Kyle Casey, McNally and Curry on the floor.
“They were playing well for us, and we wanted to go smaller,” Amaker said of his decision to stick with Miller and Saunders down the stretch. “We needed ball handlers. Wes was having, obviously, a tremendous game.… We needed defense on the perimeter with Wes and certainly with Corbin.”
The rookies struggled down the stretch, as Saunders committed a costly turnover with 2:58 to go and Miller missed a good look at the basket from deep with the Crimson down one with 10 seconds to play.
“That’s Coach’s decision,” Wright said of Amaker’s choice to leave him on the bench in the game’s final minutes. “I [was] just cheering on my teammates, being a captain and a leader on the team.”
COUGHING IT UP
The Crimson turned in one of its worst offensive performances on Saturday, posting 54 total points, matching its third-lowest total output of the year.
Harvard shot just 1.9 percentage points below its season average against Penn (44.4 percent versus 46.3 percent), but struggled connecting from beyond the arc and holding onto the ball.
The Crimson went 2 of 11 from deep and turned it over 20 times, three more than its previous high and nearly eight more than its season average.
“That definitely hurt us a lot,” said Curry of the team’s turnovers. “That was definitely key and a big reason why we ended up losing.”
This season, the Crimson is 6-3 when scoring 59 points or less and 18-1 when reaching 60.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst blistering winds at Soldier’s Field, the No. 14/15 Harvard men’s lacrosse team started its season blistering hot.
The Crimson offense scored six fourth-quarter goals and its defense allowed just nine shots all game as Harvard (1-0) cruised to an 11-4 win over Vermont (0-2) Saturday afternoon.
Sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp recorded a hat trick in the victory, while senior attack Jeff Cohen, tri-captain Kevin Vaughan, and sophomore attack Carl Zimmerman all scored twice.
“It was a good start for us,” Cohen said. “Offensively, we weren’t exactly where we wanted to be, but we played hard and pulled out the win, which is all that really matters at the start of the season.”
It was Cohen who got the scoring going eight minutes into the opening period, taking a Vaughan pass and beating Catamounts goalie David Barton for the game’s first score.
“We ran a fish-hook,” said Cohen, who led the team with 31 scores last season. “It’s a nifty little play we’ve been working on. It’s a pretty cool play in transition.”
After Connor McNamara provided an equalizer for Vermont at the 3:23 mark of the period, Vaughan and Zimmerman added goals before the quarter was up to give the Crimson a 3-1 lead after one.
Nobody scored in the second as the teams committed a combined 12 turnovers. The Crimson defense, with a number of highly-touted freshmen recruits, did not even allow an attempt on net.
“I think defensively we looked great,” Cohen said. “We really limited their shots and [goalkeeper] Harry [Krieger] played awesome.”
In the third, freshman Jack Walker recorded his first career goal—off an assist from fellow rookie Keegan Michel—and Zimmerman added his second score of the game to give the Crimson a 5-1 lead headed into the final period.
“[Both of my goals] were basically from the same spot, what we call a wing-dodge,” said Zimmerman, whose two goals Saturday equaled his total from all of last season. “I was able to get a quick step underneath my guy, beat the slide, and score. It’s a position I’m comfortable in, so I was glad I was able to take advantage of it.”
In the fourth quarter, Eipp got the scoring started quickly, beating Barton just 30 seconds in. The sophomore added another goal five minutes later to make it 7-1.
“It was a good day for our whole attack,” Cohen said.
Andrew Buckanavage and McNamara responded with two quick scores for Vermont. But Vaughan, Cohen—off Michel’s second assist—and Eipp then poured in three more goals, and freshman Will Walker added his first career score to give the Crimson an eight-point lead, 11-3.
“We had a lot of new faces out there,” Zimmerman said. “It’s a great freshman class, so it was great to see they could run with all of us in the college game. The biggest thing to making the transition from high school to college is keeping that confidence.... Seeing that they didn’t really take a step back and got right into it is great.”
The Catamounts’ Thomas Galvin added a goal with 19 seconds remaining, but by then, the game was far out of reach.
It was a dominant performance by Harvard, which outshot Vermont 41-19. Though there were eight penalties in the contest, the teams were a combined 0-for-6 on man-up opportunities.
“Our defense and our goalie, Harry Krieger, they really kept us in it the whole time,” Zimmerman said. “We ended up making a lot of mistakes on offense, but it ended up being a non-factor because our defense and our goalie played so well.”
Michel led the Crimson with seven ground balls, while senior defenseman Daniel DiMaria collected six. The Crimson also won 11 of 19 faceoffs while forcing 23 Vermont turnovers.
“Overall, it was a great team effort,” Zimmerman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 5.7 seconds remaining, junior forward Kyle Casey  took an  inbounds pass under the basket, and Tyler Bernardini slid over  to  defend. Casey went up, banked in a layup, and Lavietes Pavilion   exploded, thinking the Crimson had just retaken a one-point lead over   Penn in a vitally important Ancient Eight contest.
But lost in the  ensuing raucous was the sound of a whistle. The ref  signaled a charge,  Casey’s basket was waived off, and the Quakers  gained possession.
Out  of a timeout, Penn inbounded the ball to half court, where  Bernardini  got rid it before the Crimson could foul, and just like  that, the game  was over.
The Quakers had pulled off the upset with its season on  the line,  while for the third time in two years, Harvard had suffered a   heartbreaking, late-season, one-point conference loss in the final   seconds.
With a win on its home court—where it had not lost in 28  consecutive  games—the Crimson (24-4, 10-2 Ivy) would have clinched at  least a  share of its second consecutive Ivy title.
Instead, the Quakers’ 55-54 victory denied that  possibility, evening  Penn (17-11, 9-2) with the Crimson in the loss  column of the  conference standings, stunning the home crowd, and setting  up the  possibility of another one-game playoff in the Ivy League.
With  a victory on Saturday, Harvard would have been able to win its   first-ever outright championship by beating either Cornell or Columbia   next weekend. Now, even if it sweeps its New York road trip, the  Quakers  can set up a playoff by winning its final three games against  Brown,  Yale, and Princeton.
“It’s a devastating loss, it’s a  disappointing loss, and we should  feel those [emotions],” Crimson coach  Tommy Amaker said. “The good  thing is if we can channel it in the right  way, maybe it can help us,  and that’s what we’re hoping for next week.”
The Quakers finished the contest on a 15-5 run, wiping away a nine-point Crimson lead with eight minutes to go.
With  the Senior Night game on the line, it was Penn’s senior, Zack  Rosen,  who played like he wanted it the most down the stretch. The  point  guard—the Ancient Eight’s leading scorer—had the final nine  Quaker  points, including two free-throws to give Penn a one-point lead  with 23  seconds left on the clock.
On Harvard’s ensuing possession, the  Crimson found Corbin Miller  open for three, but the freshman’s shot  rimmed out. Harvard grabbed the  offensive rebound, and Amaker called  timeout.
The coach orchestrated a play for Casey, and the junior  attacked the  basket. But Bernardini got over in time and drew the  charge—much to  the dismay of the home crowd—and Harvard would not get  another chance.
“From where I was, it didn’t look like a charge,  but the ref made  the call,” junior point guard Brandyn Curry said.  “There’s nothing we  can do with that; we’re not going to blame the loss  on one call. There  were multiple reasons why we were in that  position.... [We had] a lot  of missed opportunities.”
The Crimson  led, 49-40, at the 8:10 mark, but Curry missed an open  three from the  right wing that would have pushed the advantage to  double-digits.
Behind  Rosen, Penn slowly began clawing back. Two free-throws by the  senior  and four points from Henry Brooks cut the deficit to five with  4:47 to  go.
Freshman Wes Saunders responded with a back-door dunk off a  pretty  pass from Curry, but Rosen answered right back with a long three  to  make it 51-49.
Casey then went one-of-two from the line on the  next Crimson  possession, and Rosen hit a step-back jumper to make it a  one-point  game with 2:27 left.
Co-captain Oliver McNally missed a  three next time down for Harvard,  but Casey was fouled going for the  rebound. His two free throws—shot  as a vociferous group of Quaker fans  chanted "choke!"—put the Crimson  up, 54-51, with 1:48 to go. But Rosen  came right back, spinning around  Miller, double-clutching, and hitting  another jumper to cut Harvard’s  lead to one.
McNally then missed  another three, and Miles Cartwright did the same  for the Quakers. But  Penn’s Fran Dougherty grabbed the offensive  rebound and got it to Rosen,  who drove and was fouled by Casey. His two  ensuing free throws proved  to be the final points of the contest.
“Give them credit, they  never folded,” Amaker said. “Rosen is a  special player.... I’m not sure  what else we could do [to stop him]. He  made some very difficult shots.”
The  Crimson led by six at the half, and the advantage got as large  as 11  early in the second. But from there, sophomore Laurent Rivard  missed a  three that would have gotten it to 14, and the Quakers went on  a 12-2  run capped by a Rosen long ball. Harvard answered with a 7-0  spurt of  its own, but the Quakers refused to let the Crimson pull away  in the  must-win game.
It was a tough final home contest for McNally and  Wright, the latter  of whom broke the Crimson career blocks record with  158, but could  only watch the final moments from the bench as Amaker  instead chose to  go with the rookies Saunders and Miller.
“Coach had a lineup out there that he thought could win the game, and you’ve got to support that,” Wright said.
Rosen  had 20 points on 6-of-14 shooting, while Casey led Harvard  with 12. The  Crimson committed 20 turnovers and shot just 32 percent in  the second  half.
The result was another devastating loss for a team that  suffered  one-point defeats late last season against Yale—on a Curry miss  at the  buzzer—and against Princeton in the Ivy League playoff on a Doug  Davis  buzzer-beater.
Tonight, it was Casey’s charge that once  again put the Crimson’s  quest to return to the NCAA tournament for the  first time since 1946 in  jeopardy.
“It’s real tough,” Wright said. “But we’ve got to move on. We have two games we’ve got to win next week.”

Digging through the archives, we discovered a few gems written by former Crimson staffers whose names might ring a bell.
Andrew T. Weil '63-64
Before Weil rose to the top of the alternative medicine field, he was defending looser, "more reasonable" regulation of marijuana ("a cubscout variety of hemp") by the government. What he hoped for? That the government might eventually realize that "getting high on pot once in a while is less harmful to body and mind than boozing it up."
Caroline B. Kennedy '80
At one point, Kennedy found herself covering a 1977 evacuation of Currier House because of a fire, which sounds pretty typical until you realize that the fire was small enough to be stamped out by foot. The Cambridge Fire Department was not pleased with the situation, which Kennedy attributed to an act of "vandalism."
"'The fire department has no comment,'" said then-Deputy Timothy O'Donnell. "'We get this kind of foolishness all the time.'"
J. Michael Crichton '64 
Celebrated author, director, and producer Michael Crichton was hailed for his thrilling mysteries, action-packed screen plays and futuristic science fiction novels. His views of Smith College, however, were definitely less progressive than the fiction for which he was known and loved. Find an excerpt from his 1963 feature story on the all-female school below:
"It is not difficult to see why Smith has been labelled the great finishing school of upper-middle class suburban wives: little imagination is required to envision these girls in fifteen years, still pretty and still smiling, in their car coats and station wagons, driving the kids around town in Stamford, Connecticut or Shaker Heights, Ohio."
He continues, "...one of the most striking characteristics of the Smith education is the marked passivity of the students. They sit blankly in lecture; large numbers of them knit."

With Sunday night's 84th Annual Academy Awards fast approaching, you only have a few hours remaining to impress your friends with your prophetic abilities (and possibly win some bets) by predicting who will win which award. This year, consider paying attention to the predictions that Ben T. Zauzmer '15 has posted on his website, Ben's Oscar Forecast.
Zauzmer, a self-professed film buff, devised his own purely mathematical means of determining the future award winners. For each nominated film, his method relies on a tally of other award wins, Oscar nominations in other categories, and quantitative scores from websites like Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. Incorporating data for Oscar nominations since 2001, Zauzmer used linear algebra to determine which factors have weighed into past wins. This process was "akin to finding a giant line of best fit," Zauzmer said.
Although there is no telling yet how successful Zauzmer's predictions will prove to be, they are pretty similar to those of Melena Ryzik, aka "the Carpetbagger," and New York Times's Oscar oracle. Like Ryzik, Zauzmer foresees "The Artist" sweeping the big awards this year, predicting wins for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor among other categories.
Can we credit Harvard with teaching Zauzmer the math skills to pull off a project like this? Apparently not. "I unfortunately didn't have time to fit math into my schedule this semester," Zauzmer said. It seems he found a way to work in math outside of the classroom, and in the process created something that you may benefit from placing a few bets on.
