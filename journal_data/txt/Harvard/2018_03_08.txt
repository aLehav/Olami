Directed by Mark Pellington, “Nostalgia” admirably tries to be a solemn reflection on time, on the transience of our bodies, and on the permanence of objects. It’s too bad that in the course of nearly two hours it melts into a puddle of sentimentality. The film engulfs you in nostalgia that is not romantic, but stiflingly sad. Each space, tinged with blue, features wan sunlight to the effect of an Instagram filter commonly reserved for lonely beach photos, so indiscriminately applied in this film to the point of being clinical and counterproductively numbing. The film hinges on a theoretically profound, yet practically cringeworthy, question: “Can what we hold in our hands be the same as what we hold in our hearts?” (The answer: Obviously.) While nostalgia proves a worthwhile emotional well to plumb in haltingly profound moments, the film drags on. Every other moment is distilled, and every off-handed glance is made quiveringly and interminably emotional, milked for thematic reinforcement.
Screenwriter Alex Ross Perry weaves a structurally inventive plot, using inherited memorabilia of a constellation of connections among the characters. An elderly Ronnie (Bruce Dern) prepares for his death, seeking to eke out more value from his possessions from a kindly insurance assessor, Daniel (John Ortiz). “I’m not a relic,” he sternly reminds him. Helen (Ellen Burstyn), a grieving widow, roams the charred remains of her home like a ghostly gravekeeper and clings to a vintage baseball, her late husband’s most prized possession. She eventually, and reluctantly, enlists the help of Will (Jon Hamm), a professional collector who generously appraises the ball, and does some excavating of his own at his childhood home with his sister, Donna (Catherine Keener). Will spends a night there, cloaked in the past, and emerges more appreciative of the treasures he plies daily. While Burstyn, Hamm, and Keener convincingly and expressively portray their characters’ inner turmoil, the plot is too unfocused to sustain investment in their emotional developments.
The dialogue, which primarily takes the form of monologues, is riddled with grandiose, not-quite-poetic axioms (“My proximity to tragedy is a smidge further away than somebody who truly has to develop a barrier”) that undermine the raw emotional tenor of the characters’ situations. Perry spotlights Ronnie’s daughter for so long. She struggles to deliver exaggerated expressions such on-the-nose observations, like, “You outgrow the tendency to assign meaning to a piece of paper,” as if she were in an awkward audition tape. He could have more simply illuminated the sadness of generational change with more judicious editing, without peripheral characters who don’t further the plot in any way and irk with their dramatic trembling. If Helen’s drama unraveled more directly after Ronnie’s (who declares his belongings garbage), their deeply divergent attitudes toward their belongings would have created a thoughtful friction: They are both elderly and face lonely futures, and must evaluate their possessions in order to stave off desperation. But Perry drops Ronnie’s plotline like it’s the yellowing, primitive tennis racquet that Donna offers her disinterested daughter Tallie (Annalise Basso).
Pellington exhaustingly shrouds just about everything in gravitas. A slow-motion sequence of Helen moving through Las Vegas with her beloved valuables, ready to part with them, wilts with comically melodramatic editing. The camera looks up at her, tracking her as she appears to make a dramatic crusade through a hospital ward under time-pressure. A shot of her looking dejected but composed against an industrial skyline looks borrowed from a sad pharmaceutical commercial. Overall, the movie weaves together a lot of uncomfortable long takes and shots of crumpling grimaced faces—these oozily sentimental cinematic standbys demand the subtlest calibrated facial expressions and are at least successfully visceral, thanks to Burstyn and Keener’s aching enactments of heartbreak.
Despite the film’s superfluous emotional flourishes, the most poignant moments are mystically and simply experiential. In a particularly memorable sequence filmed from above, the bare mattresses, musty curtains, and child portraits on the wall in Will’s childhood home make the rooms look like those of an eerily gutted dollhouse. They suggest that stepping into the past with its rotting landmarks is disquieting, especially when tragedy strikes as it does in this film. In a silent tour of Tallie’s bedroom, Pellington also trenchantly explores how in an era of digitally curated personal spaces, a tangible private space accounts imperfectly for its owner in rumpled sheets, in bedside lamps left on, in haphazardly scribbled notes-to-self.
But the touching moments are too transient. The ending is ineffectually emotional, as Tallie’s classmate approaches Tallie’s parents with sage-like solemnity, and delivers yet another grave monologue. Pellington could have indulged the clinically detached, voyeuristic perspective that Daniel provides right from the start, his professional intrusiveness serving as an apt entry point into various personal stories. If Pellington had made the film a sparser version of the documentary format it resembles, tying up loose plot digressions with a centralizing figure and fewer characters overall, the ones given the spotlight might have revelled beautifully in more silence.

It’s the kind of knowledge more commonly associated with stalkers, but all longtime fans of Taylor Swift can rattle off a major segment of her “long list of ex-lovers,” including not only A-listers like John Mayer and Harry Styles, but also her high school flings. Even casual fans (and haters) might admit some voyeuristic interest in who inspired the cutting “Picture to Burn” or optimistic “Begin Again,” and Swift undoubtedly knows it. Why else leave hints in the liner notes? Most songwriters are less quick to publicly hint at the real-life inspiration for their work. But, as any acolyte of “Lemonade” or “4:44” knows, a touch of authenticity can make every production decision feel a bit more meaningful.
Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” celebrated the 40th anniversary of its Grammy win for Album of the Year last month. It did not win for any grand social statement—which the Grammys tend to ignore—or for shattering musical barriers, though little innovations like drumming on an office chair contributed to its impeccable pop-rock sound. It won for having 11 brilliant songs—some wistful, some buoyant, some haunting, and all seemingly directed at bandmates.
“Rumours,” was forged in the ugly aftermath of breakups and divorces involving all five of its members, all in the year directly preceding “Rumours”’s release, 1976. Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, the guitar-and-vocals duo who had catapulted Fleetwood Mac to the heights of commercial success when they joined the band two years earlier, saw their relationship unravel. So did John and Christine McVie, the bassist and keyboard player respectively. So too did drummer Mick Fleetwood and his wife. The band channeled their personal pain into making some of the best, and most devastating music of their career. “Rumours” rightfully came to be considered an iconic breakup(s) album.
The legacy of “Rumours” is, in many ways, complicated to evaluate. It sometimes stands for the entirety of Fleetwood Mac’s “golden era” output (from their 1975 self-titled album to 1987’s “Tango in the Night”), which is a shame. All of those albums are classics to varying degrees, but the power and success of “Rumours” acts as a sort of black hole into which Fleetwood Mac discussions vanish. This reductionism is at least partly due to gender. Women comprise two of its three primary songwriters (Nicks and Christine McVie), making Fleetwood Mac a relatively feminine outlier in the classic-rock canon. Critics tend to minimize and simplify the female artists in that canon. Take, for example, Joni Mitchell, who had an incredible string of highly acclaimed albums in the early ’70s, but is mostly remembered only for her magnum opus “Blue.”
This trend persists 40 years later. Given her importance to the band, it is perpetually shocking to see how little space Stevie Nicks gets on “Rumours.” With only two solo lead songs (“Dreams” and “Gold Dust Woman”) and two more where she shares the microphone (“The Chain” and “I Don’t Want to Know”), she has the shortest spotlight time of Fleetwood Mac’s vocalist trio. Her impassioned and iconic “Silver Springs” was cut from the album because of its initial runtime and relegated to the B-side of “Go Your Own Way.” Contemporary critical analysis of Stevie Nicks is in retrospect stunningly problematic, with more space dedicated to her appearance than her music. One piece in the early ’80s by famed critic Lester Bangs was simply titled “Stevie Nicks: Lilith or Bimbo?”
In spite of this unfair treatment, Nicks leaves behind a legacy greater than those of her highly talented and interesting bandmates. On “Rumours,” she further develops the mysticism of earlier Fleetwood Mac songs like “Rhiannon.” Her lyrics on the closing “Gold Dust Woman,” complemented by the song’s captivating instrumentation, are more haunting and evocative than anything Fleetwood Mac had done previously. The mesmerizing two-chord simplicity of “Dreams,” the band’s only number-one single, has a similar effect. On Nicks’s third songwriting contribution, the country-inflected “I Don’t Want to Know,” she and Buckingham turn mutual bitterness into close-harmony fireworks. Often overlooked, it’s a career vocal highlight for both, which is especially clear in the vulnerability of the second verse: “You got me rocking and a-reeling / Hanging on to you.” All three of these songs poignantly turn her struggles with relationships, identity, and substance abuse into near-mythology. Nicks essentially created the image of the ethereal superstar. Artists like Lorde, Lana Del Rey, and even Madonna have all borrowed heavily from her mold to express themselves in similarly mystical ways.
Of course, the rest of the band pulls their weight, too. 1977 caught Nicks, Buckingham, and Christine McVie at their respective peaks. From the glimmering acoustic masterpiece “Never Going Back Again” to the barn-burning hit “Go Your Own Way,” Buckingham’s contributions amaze, though his chair-drumming adventurousness would peak with 1979’s “Tusk.” Meanwhile, McVie found some hope amid the despair: The album’s one unambiguously optimistic love song, “You Make Loving Fun,” alternates between grooving funk and soaring pop. But the irresistible Clinton campaign anthem “Don’t Stop” and heartrending mid-album breather “Songbird” conceal anxiety (“I know you don’t believe that it’s true / I never meant any harm to you”) and longing (“And I wish you all the love in the world / But most of all, I wish it from myself”) under their deceptively cheery surfaces.
And then, there’s “The Chain.” Tying together multiple song-fragments and crediting every member, the band’s signature song starts the second side with some of the richest vocal harmonies ever committed to record—and only builds from there. The chorus layers melodies from Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie over each other, creating a fitting echo: “I can still hear you saying (still hear you saying) you would never break the chain / (Never break the chain)” as John McVie’s bass and Mick Fleetwood’s drums crescendo, driving home this expression of betrayal and disappointment. One breakdown and bass-driven rebuild later, the vocalists sing with increasing desperation, “Chains keep us together.” We don’t need to fully understand this lyric. We know they mean every word.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s practice of admitting a disproportionate number of applicants who are related to alumni has routinely made headlines through the years. Most recently, some students and alumni of the College signed a letter to university administrators across the country asking for transparency on how legacy applicants are treated in the admissions process, arguing that preference for legacy admissions is “hampering economic mobility.”
We stand by our precedent that abolishing preferential treatment for legacy applicants would be a positive step towards socioeconomic justice. We remain steadfast in our belief that legacy status should not be a consideration in the admissions process.
While we acknowledge there are likely a variety of reasons for why children of alumni are accepted into the College at a higher rate than non-legacy students, we call on Harvard to be more transparent on exactly how legacy status factors into the admissions process. The College’s FAQ site vaguely states that legacy students “may receive an additional look.” We urge the College to be more forthcoming about what this means in practice. To that end, Harvard ought to release its relevant policies and data to illustrate how legacy impacts its decision calculus.
We are also perplexed by administrators’ claim that legacy admits are “better candidates on average” to enter Harvard. If this is true, then removing legacy status from consideration would not substantially diminish family connections to the University nor the donations that comes from them. It would simply render the admissions process more meritocratic.
If legacy admits are truly “better candidates,” their advantages likely result from an intersection between socioeconomic status and educational opportunity. While the median household income in the U.S. is about $59,000, a Crimson report found that 88 percent of surveyed legacy students matriculating last year come from households with incomes over $125,000. The college admissions process is already skewed in favor of these students, as tutoring, SAT prep, and the freedom to forgo a job during the school year are all benefits that many of these students have that many of their peers do not. Though it may be through no fault of their own, students from privileged backgrounds are already granted a huge advantage on their competition. At the very least, their parents’ personal ties to Harvard should not grant them an additional advantage.
By giving legacy applicants a leg up in the application and admissions process, Harvard displays a lack of commitment to its professed dedication to diversity for incoming classes. The College admissions website states students at the College share “an infinite range of experiences and aspirations.” This range of experiences and aspirations is dramatically compressed by the prioritization of familial connections. If Harvard’s wishes to achieve its professed objective of achieving a diverse learning environment, it should endeavor to find the most capable and accomplished students from all sectors of society. Legacy preference undermines that goal.
Harvard prides itself on cultivating the future leaders, artists, scholars, and scientists of the world. For it to maintain this reputation, it must seek out applicants who indicate great promise in their chosen field—and one’s parents should not be that indicator. We acknowledge that the socioeconomic disparities that hinder some applicants from marketing themselves to Harvard will not be eradicated overnight. Yet removing preferential treatment for legacies will be a welcome and overdue step forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicholas: To be Black in America is to be traumatized; not all at once, but little by little, stretched out over every day of your life. Stretched and minimized, because the trauma is not an event; or rather, it’s an event that predates our individual Black bodies, the seismic rumbles of some cataclysm that occured in the dawn of our history  and rumbles in the back of our brains. Which is to say that it’s generational, which is to say it forms us in the womb, and we emerge caught up in it. Which is to say that America is a bed of Brown and Black trauma, and to be born Brown and Black in that birthing bed is to be traumatized.
This sounds abstract, but it’s not. This trauma is visceral, and it manifest in daily pain, like so much crystal-cold water drowning us slowly but surely. This is what we want to focus on: Pain, real pain—the real pain of being of color in this country. To bring it even more down to earth: What we’re talking about is mental health, the mental health for which this university purports to be on a crusade. But what it, and this world, fails to understand is that for people of color, mental (un)health is synonymous with racial trauma. And the two of us, as student activists, have a particular relationship with this mental (un)health.
Salma: Trauma experienced viscerally has had noticeable effects on my day-to-day life at Harvard. For most of my time here, I’ve been unable to name those traumas.  My freshman year, I came home every day to a roommate who denied my identity as a “real Muslim” because I was “peaceful.” My first-year common room became a space where my existence was transformed into synecdoche for my entire religion or race in the eyes of those with whom I lived. I didn’t realize how much of a toll this would have on me—how much pressure would brew in that room, how viscerally anxious I would become every time I stepped foot into a space or activity that was supposed to be my own—until my lowest days, when the weight of it all crashed down on me and it felt like my body was ceasing to function.
N: In our piece a few weeks ago, we discussed anger in activism. That’s not what we’re talking about now. We aren’t angry—not here. This is what comes before the rage. This is that void that we all live in; this is the “Sunken Place.” Unlike anger, pain isn’t, and can never be, positive (in the sense of creative/generative, not in the sense of “good”). The sadness I feel is deep, destabilizing, debilitating, damning. It does not build. It buries.
The point therein is that, as you say, this is a question of mental health, not activism, and must be answered as any question of mental health. Activists like us must make time and space for ourselves. We must sit in this generational trauma and learn, not to overcome it, but to live in it, just as mental (un)health cannot be beaten, but merely survived.
S: When I reflect on growth, I reflect on how lucky I am now to have gained the ability to name my oppressions. The pain becomes more bearable when I come to recognize that these forces exist outside of me, that my anxieties, my depression, and the hurt that I feel are a direct result of structures and systems rigged against me and people like me—not as a result of my own individual actions or responsibilities.
This vital step—the act of identifying and naming that which causes my pain—has been the most important part of healing for me. It has allowed me to rid myself of shame and guilt around these struggles and given me the space to speak truth to power. It has given me the space to have these conversations publicly, with people like you, Nicholas. It’s made this feel less lonely.
N: Is self-care activism? I don’t think so. Not because it isn’t important, but precisely because of its importance. Self-care doesn’t solve any problems because it isn’t an attempt to dismantle the nation that perpetuates this trauma; it is simply an attempt to survive. Self-care is selfish. And in and of itself, that is a good. That is how the two of us survive. And when I say survive, I mean literally keep our hearts beating: Erica Garner is proof that the pain, the mental (un)health of being Black will kill us long before the police can.
S: Our existence toggles the line between progress and survival. In some moments we invest ourselves fully in social change. We sacrifice everything—time, relationships, happiness, health, sleep—to push for something bigger than ourselves, for some small step towards justice. We welcome in our mental (un)health. We stay in this space for as long as we can hold our breaths, immersing ourselves in a cesspool of oppression—dismantling, destroying, building, converting, as quickly as we can, with as much force as possible. Our lungs collapse under the weight. We break down. We freeze. We drown.
I call you. You pick up. You pull me back to equilibrium. We breathe slowly. Another email pops up in our inboxes—it’s another catastrophe done unto our people, another trauma.
We take our deepest breath. We dive back in.

It’s 3 a.m. on Housing Day 2017, and there’s nothing left to do. The shirts are sorted and stacked in the closet. The welcome letters are printed, and the video has been released to the world. Everyone with any semblance of responsibility for the coming day knows where they need to be and when they need to be there. I text a previous Cabot House Committee co-chair, Rebecca J. Ramos ’17, who is also still awake because Becca is always awake, and ask what else I should do. Go to bed, she tells me, there’s nothing left you can do.
The reality of organizing Housing Day as a Quad HoCo co-chair is that it is inherently self-defeating. No matter what we do, the lengths to which we go, or the expenses we don’t spare, we know that we will still walk into a room with many crestfallen faces. Every year, there are tears. We talk about our "n+1"  housing, the scope of our House community, and how much we love our House, but many freshmen still wish that we weren’t the ones to storm their room.
I can’t really blame them for falling victim to Housing Day’s greatest narrative. How many people, from the first day of school, tell freshmen that there is no fate worse than getting “quadded”? Whether they “River Ran” or burned miniature boats on the Charles, plenty of freshmen make a greater effort to avoid the Radcliffe Quadrangle than they do to get an A in Expos. As much as we boast about our excellent housing, vibrant house life, regular (and popular) parties, and the regularity of the Quad shuttle, it is difficult to reverse a perspective fed to freshmen from as early as Opening Days, their First-Year Outdoor Program trip, or even Visitas. Unsurprisingly, many freshmen who have been cautioned against being Quadded never get over it when they do.
So, some leave. For me, the fifth Monday of the spring semester is not just the day that add-drop officially ends. It’s the day that inter-House transfer decisions come out: It’s the day that some of my friends announce that they are leaving. As a HoCo co-chair, every outgoing transfer feels a bit like a personal indictment of the job I’ve been doing. Though I feel like I’ve failed the people who leave, the reality is most of those who leave us never gave us a chance. They didn’t try to engage in the community that we work so hard to build. People who transfer out look at what they don’t have around them, care about where they are not. They never look at what we do have, and they don’t care about what the House actually is.
It is important to remember that for every Quadling who leaves us, there are many others who choose to stay. By and large, those Cabotians who were open-minded enough to give us a chance stay until senior year, and many actively work to improve House life. A former roommate of a group that transferred to Quincy chose to stay in Cabot last spring and has since joined the House Committee. Some find their place at Cabot Café, in the Third Space Art Studio, in the House’s theater program, or amongst our intramural teams. Though many enter the Quad with trepidation, I know that the vast majority of those who give the Quad a chance will stay and graduate satisfied with their House—contrary to what a freshman might be told to believe.
Every year on Housing Day, Stephanie Khurana, one of the Cabot Faculty Deans, addresses the assembled students in our packed dining hall. She tells them that all we in Cabot ask is that they give us a chance. Though she does not state it explicitly, Khurana (not Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who by this time has already delivered the mission of the College) knows what anyone who storms dorms on Housing Day wearing a Quad t-shirt knows: many of the freshmen in the room wish they were in a different dining hall, one about a mile farther south and with a view of Boston. Some of those new Cabotians hear her message, but some will have elected not even to make the short trip to the Quad for dinner to hear her say it in the first place. Less than half a day after being housed, some freshmen will have already written off the Quad. For the roughly 25 percent of the Class of 2021 that will be lucky enough to be visited by polar bears, trees, or codfish on Housing Day this year, I can only ask of you one thing: come to dinner. Give us a chance, and I can promise you that you’ll want to stay. For the rest, come visit. We’re just 0.7 miles away.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, with two hours to go until the 5 p.m. deadline, I found myself watching the man at the copy store hand me inch-thick reams of off-white paper on which was printed my senior thesis.
It’s an odd sort of feeling—having pondered, labored over, drafted, edited, and re-written something for the past year—to finally hold the thick stack of paper that is its final, physical manifestation. I don’t know what exactly I expected. But to slide the printout into its binder, to head out into the rain towards the Government Department offices at the Center for Government and International Studies, and to finally hand over the two black binders was remarkably anticlimactic.
The senior thesis lives as a sort of larger-than-life being in my imagination. It feels, despite what the department tells you, like the conclusion of my academic career. When discussing theses, words like “milestone,” “capstone,” and “culmination” get thrown around. I recall thinking freshman year that it seemed fantastically impossible that any one person could conceive of an argument that required such a daunting number of pages—a hundred, no less—to outline.
I must confess that even this year it was often difficult to see precisely where the end lay. I had accumulated enough books in my dorm room to strike out on my own and found a new library, and yet I did not feel any closer to crafting a living and breathing argument. (I’ve heard not a few jokes from fellow thesis writers about its similarity to another roughly nine-months-long process, but fortunately for both me and my thesis, this will not consume the better part of my disposable income for the next 18 years.)
I spent much of my time at Harvard writing, either for class or The Crimson, and yet still a senior thesis remained shrouded in a sense of mystery and improbability. Looking back on it now, it almost feels like an act of magic, turning all those endless piles of books from Widener into something I could run off a copy machine.
I was undoubtedly fortunate to have friends who felt similarly. (Thesis writing also became a bit of gallows humor. I had a pact with one friend that we would not mention our theses in each other’s presence.) I have been touched by those around me, how they reminded me that to wander only sometimes means to be lost.
Yet, candidly, it was sometimes hard to convince myself of the feasibility of writing a thesis. An original contribution to the existing literature, mounds of research, and over 100 pages of text seemed far beyond the horizon of a 21-year-old undergraduate. Even though I felt at home with my topic, I did not fully know, until relatively recently, what the full nature of my argument would be.
In those moments of doubt, I convinced myself of my thesis’s inevitability. As I meandered through different potential areas of research, considered divergent approaches, and found unexpected results, it sometimes felt like I was blindly stumbling towards a destination that I still told myself I could see.
And yet, with every step, sometimes forward but also to the side or rear, I could look back and see that I was just a bit closer to the end. It was not in the places or ways I had necessarily imagined, and an outside observer who asked me to describe my topic once a month for the past year would no doubt think me a flip-flopper extraordinaire. Slowly, however, the notion that I had convinced myself of—that by March 7 there would be a thesis—began to take shape. The page count began to tick upwards, out of my research emerged results, and not a few times after some late-night thesis work, my brain, willed to sleep, instead forced me to get up again to jot down a few extra ideas.
Ultimately, that I could not see the end from the beginning did not matter. In fits and starts, the fog slowly began to clear. As I continued to hope and believe that the process of thesis writing would end in a product halfway decent, the thing that had seemed like both a rite of passage and an improbability began to seem like neither.
It felt like just another paper, albeit (quite) a bit longer. It was the conclusion of a year-long writing process, sure, but still only one portion of my time at Harvard. One hundred pages, but each one could be—and was—written. I have felt a renewed confidence reminding me that to walk through a bit of a fog does not mean that the destination is not there, waiting.
These thoughts may all seem rather cliched. Of course, writing a senior thesis is a privilege, not a condemnation. All the same, it is the most significant academic project I have ever undertaken.
And yet from my post-thesis perch I rather feel that the climax of this story took place in little bits over the course of the past several months, rather than all at once yesterday. The moments when the fog began to clear, bit by bit—not when the finished product was produced—those were the truly special moments of it all.
In some sense, writing a thesis has a quasi-spiritual aspect to it. It’s the performance of an act of faith that, even as you’re picking through the murky early months and even as the length and scale prevent you from grasping the whole thing until near the end, the destination is worth the trek.

Heels click neatly on the slick pavement; fog settles faintly down on a warm February night. It’s hard to keep up with Elsie A. Tellier ’19 as she marches down the mostly empty streets, talking—and walking—a mile a minute.
“A lot of people in my freshman year knew me as that one girl who made this really long post in the Facebook page explaining the history of women’s sizing and why women’s sizing is messed up.” She pauses. “It’s a long story.”
Today, Tellier is wearing blush-colored heels, light-wash jeans, a magenta blouse, and a coral sweater. It’s “pretty obvious” that pink is her favorite color, she says. Only one accessory doesn’t match the theme: a cotton face mask adorned with Disney characters—Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck—which is, she explains, the only design available in her size.

She’s wearing the mask because it’s flu season, and, as she explains, she has to be “careful about getting sick.” Tellier has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that affects her lungs, pancreas, and other organs.
“I like to explain it by saying that the one lever that manages the salt and water in my body just decided to quit, and so all of my organs are filled with a thick and sticky mucus,” she says. We’re sitting in her room now, a quiet single in Leverett with a view of the Memorial Drive headlights streaming by, and beyond, the Charles, aglow in the dusk.
Tellier’s room is not quite cluttered, not quite spare—little white roses garland one side, where her bed and desk are, and her wardrobe is filled with more shades of pinks and creams than I knew existed. On the other side of her room, “Star Wars” and anime posters mingle on the wall. Princess Leia and Sailor Moon figurines dot her shelves and cabinets. Her wheelchair rests near the door. The right wheel is painted with swirling roses, petals flying in the wind, and the left features a constellation of stars and planets, light pinks and blues.
 
She’s telling me about cystic fibrosis, or CF, and how, unlike some other chronic illnesses, it’s both congenital and incurable. “It’s not something that’s reversible; it’s not something that can be treated. It can only be sustained,” she says. “Everything I do to treat myself is just a life-sustaining treatment, something to keep me alive longer.”
The disease’s congenital nature also differentiates it from other illnesses which are “biographical disruptions [that] onset later in life,” she says. “It’s not something that you can think of in this narrative of pre-CF and post-CF.” Instead, it’s an “immediate identity.”
Tellier says she was diagnosed at 12. The diagnosis finally explained why she was “continuously sick” as a child. “Certain things changed,” she says, “but it was never like the symptoms didn’t change, they just got worse over time.”
“My identity as someone who’s sick”—her consonants take on a hard edge—“or where it felt like something was really wrong, that didn’t change.”
***
Tellier was raised by her aunt and father in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Winnipeggers “basically live in Hell,” she says, laughing. Winnipeg temperatures range from 40 below in winter to near 100 in summer.
On the day of her diagnosis, she says she made a decision: “I wanted to go to college before I died. At the time, I was told my life expectancy was 30… I was 12. I was told basically [that] my life was half over.” Her eyes roam around her room as she remembers.
Despite missing nearly two years of high school due to her illness, Tellier graduated first in her class. Though she didn’t make her dream school—Oxford—she landed here, where she is concentrating in sociology.
It was during those high school years that clothing became more than something she wore for Tellier. As a child, she would marvel at models on television and in the pages of “Harper’s Bazaar” and “Vogue.” Yet fashion remained “an ideal, something that I couldn’t afford but could appreciate as some art form.”
“I think [my interest] grew as I stopped thinking about fashion as something that was exclusively what people put on models,” she says.
“Over time fashion became a really comfortable space for me to be, because I was never really happy with my body. Not quite in a body image way, but because I was always sick—I’m so used to seeing my body as something that’s…” A pause. “‘Defective’ is not a nice word to use for myself, but I never had a sense of really liking my body, because it fails me.”
So fashion became “something that was fun, and something that got me up in the morning. It was like, I need to get out the door because people need to see me today, they have to see how cute I look,” she says, smiling.
Her dedication to fashion grew as she started sharing it with other people on her Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr. In the spring of 2016, she posted a picture of herself dressed as Princess Leia, seated in her wheelchair. It accumulated nearly 100,000 notes and responses from “a lot of other young people who were disabled and had chronic illnesses, [who] expressed how great it was to see someone like them looking cute and having fun.” The post’s popularity culminated in Tellier meeting Carrie Fisher, a photo of which she shared with the caption, “UPDATE: SPACE MOM WANNABE MEETS REAL SPACE MOM!!!”
“Over time, sharing my fashion and talking about fashion became a way to cope with chronic illness, and a way not to hide my illness, but to make things that are typically seen as unattractive and generic be fun and creative,” she says. “Wheelchairs aren’t usually thought of as cute, but I said, ‘I’m gonna paint my wheelchair to make it cute.’ I would often wear cannulas—cannulas are never cute, but if I have to wear it in public, I’m going to tie a ribbon around it, bedazzle my oxygen tank.
“So it’s finding cute covers, finding ways you can deal with different medical supplies but still make it cute, still make it a part of your personality. My idea of fashion is never to dictate a certain sense of style… but to make sure that for my own sake, I wasn’t feeling controlled by my illness.”
***
We’ve reached Harvard Square by now, and we duck inside an Ann Taylor. Tellier greets a saleswoman with a cheery “Hello!” and removes her mask, unwinding the slender ear loops with care. She’d brought up certain “fashion rules” earlier, and I ask her—nervously—if I’m breaking any rules today.
“You’re fine!” she says, not looking up from a rack of blazers. “You can wear any four colors plus any neutral.” I nod, relieved.
A silence follows—I let her shop—until she begins to talk with a new urgency, unprompted.
“For me, I see fashion as the middle ground between people. Everyone has their own style,” she says. “I feel like when I dress up a lot and make my chair super cute… it breaks the ice for a lot of people, makes it easier to talk about me being in a chair, or my chair itself.
“I find that when some people see someone being disabled and dressing up and having fun, it helps challenge that stereotype that all disability is inherently terrible and your life sucks. Because it doesn’t. Not for the most part, anyways, not more than anyone else’s. There’s a lot of rhetoric, like, ‘Wow, it’s amazing that people just wake up in the morning!’ But we’re just living our lives. And part of that is dressing up and having fun, having fashion sense—or having no fashion sense. Either way, we’re normal people.”
She turns her attention briefly to a rack of pantsuits, and then looks back at me.
“I want to make sure that people acknowledge that I’m disabled and know that it’s a part of me, but it’s not the only part of me. It’s something I have to incorporate [into] the way I live and the way I dress, and so much of my life revolves around [the] schedule of being sick, and that doesn’t mean I can’t take that extra step of dressing up and making sure that I feel good in the morning. That I feel good about myself.”
We take one last circuit around the store and head back into the night. It’s stopped raining; the wet tarmac reflects the streetlights. In the early evening gloom, the white of her face mask is luminous.

I enter the Harvard Art Museums on a windy, rain-soaked day. Perhaps gay, artistic energies travel like Mary Poppins: at the behest of the winds. If so, this is a good omen for my quest: find the secret gays of the museum. If not, I have been well-trained by years of convincing myself that Taylor Swift is in love with her former best friend Karlie Kloss. If anyone can find the gays in this bastion of marble and oil paint, it is me.
I abide by a strict set of criteria: if the figures portrayed in the art seem gay to me, they are. My rationale is incontrovertible, regardless of any irrefutable art history evidence to the contrary. Let. Me. Have. This.
I begin in the gallery directly to the right of the main entrance (labeled “Fogg Museum,” for those of you following along at home). I am immediately greeted by a nude bronze female form, sculpted with overtones of heterosexuality by Aristide Maillol. The metal woman stands chest first, holding a towel stiffly behind her—she’s allegedly wading in shallow water, but I’m unsure how her washcloth can help her. This is not a good sign.
But lo! I catch a glimpse of Picasso’s “Woman with a Chignon” across the room and I am saved. She slouches forward, elbows on a table, enrobed in blue and yellow paint. Her eyes gaze blankly at the viewer. She is very clearly a bored bisexual. Picasso may have looked to depict pure human ennui, but in doing so, he clearly wrote, “I am a young, sad bisexual” in the paint swirls above this woman’s head. I need not qualify my assertion any further—this is quite obviously sufficient evidence. It is early yet in my odyssey for gays and the tides are turning in my favor.
I turn away from Miss Chignon and am immediately struck by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec’s “The Hangover (Suzanne Valadon).” Toulouse-Lautrec’s model, Suzanne, was a former circus performer and his mistress for two years. This suggests heterosexuality. However, her authoritatively cut blouse says otherwise—she reads more Rachel Maddow than artist’s mistress. Suzanne is drinking alone, pondering her past in the circus, and fully above any 19th-century heteronormative nonsense. I see you, girl.
The rest of the room is full of overwhelmingly straight landscapes; sure, they’re dense with curved, rolling hills, but those hills have never cried while listening to Sufjan Stevens. In the next room over, I find “Red and Pink” by Georgia O’Keeffe. One could explain away these organic forms, likening them to flowers, flames or the “sanguine recesses of the body” as the placard does.
Please.
Sanguine recesses? Please. Any gay woman worth (The Price Of) her salt can sense the deep aura of lesbianism radiating from this painting. GAAAAAAAAAAY.
The first works I see upon moving into the Busch-Reisinger section of the museum are two Amazonian women: a small sculpture next to an evocative oil painting. These works may be placed next to each other due to their thematic similarities, but out of those thematic similarities comes the concentrated essence of lesbianism.
The gays are more sporadic in this section of the museum; less portraiture and more religious imagery makes queering too trying for even me. I eventually stumble upon “Self Portrait with Cat” by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Kirchner’s cat is named “Boby,” the room is bathed in pinks and purples, and the man is wearing a red suit that can only be described as jaunty. If this portrait is not gay, it at the very least has strong lesbian energy.
I am not foolhardy enough nor confident enough in my queering abilities to broach the topic of our founding fathers. However, early colonial favorite John Singleton Copley painted some choice gays. Most notable are the paired portraits of the Boylston brothers, each wearing ornate green robes and what look like silk pink shower caps. I can only describe this as a Tegan and Sara situation.
I don’t want to proliferate the narrative of sad gays, but man: “Miss Alice Kurtz” painted by Thomas Eakins is both incredibly sad and incredibly gay. Her father described her as “healthy and athletic,” which I interpret to mean “flaming lesbian.”
Somewhere in this second floor dead-zone of founding fathers and Christianity, I find the clearly gay imagery I’ve been waiting for: “Summer Scene (Bathers)” by Frederic Bazille. I count eight strapping young men in various states of undress, two “wrestling” in the background.
Attempting to queer the second floor of the museum was tiring, but I soldiered on to reach the motherlode on the third floor: Grecian art. Patroclus didn’t die in Achilles’ armor so that I could ignore the blatant homoeroticism in each and every sculpture and vase on this floor.
Unfortunately, the third floor has more partial torsos and fragmented pottery than fully formed homosexual relations. There is no Sapphic imagery to my knowledge, and Achilles and Patroclus lack significant representation. Still, I manage to draw the conclusion that every Grecian urn is, at the very least, bisexual.
Note: all incidences of male homosexuality verified by self-identified “resident homosexual” and friend of the writer Frank M. Cahill.

“You are in the matrix.”
The DJ switches the track to an unrecognizable, slowed-down EDM remix of a 1990s pop hit. The mass of bodies suddenly begins to move in slow motion. Discarded mini-cans of limited-edition Polar Unicorn Kisses™ seltzer and half-eaten pouches of chia seed pudding litter the floor of the dimly lit, underground club. A brass ensemble adds to the cacophony.  Mysterious staff members dubbed “mischief makers” push through the crowd, one carrying a large traffic cone and another a set of bongo drums.
It is 7:50 a.m. EST.
***
Thirty minutes prior, we’re standing on Tremont Street in the morning light, next to a small crowd of people in brightly colored leggings and parkas. Are we early?
A gruff construction worker approaches the motley crew and asks us what we’re waiting for.
“A dance party,” replies a woman in leopard print leggings; she qualifies that you have to pay to enter.
“What time?”
“7 a.m..”
We are waiting to enter Cure Lounge (described as “Boston’s Sexiest Lounge” on its website) in the wee hours of a Thursday morning to attend Daybreaker: an “early morning dance movement” that holds events in 22 different cities. The group’s first event took place in New York City in 2013, and several Daybreakers have been held in Boston since then.
Daybreaker believes that starting the day with dancing—and a yoga class “pregame” for an extra fee—will provide the energy needed to get attendees through the next 24 hours. Their website breaks down the Daybreaker D-O-S-E™, the combination of brain chemicals (Dopamine, Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Endorphins) conducive to an improved mood.
We are not morning people. We enjoy dancing, but not before the sun is fully in the sky—or before the sun is up at all—and even less so sober. We are very, very skeptical.
The doors open promptly at 7 a.m., and we are welcomed by two exceedingly chipper women wearing a variety of brightly colored spandex items in a loose interpretation of this morning’s “90’s Throwback: Radical Rewind” theme. Our hands are stamped with glow-in-the-dark, vaguely Illuminati-esque logos, and we blearily descend the stairs of Cure Lounge.
We emerge onto the dance floor, soundtracked by long-forgotten top 40 hits of 1995. People roll up their yoga mats and mingle by a snack table piled high with pink himalayan sea salt chips and packets labeled “Discover Hemp.” The scent of vodka and vomit, leftover from the previous night’s debauchery, hangs in the air. There are significantly fewer people than we had anticipated.
We look at each other. “Shit.”
*NSYNC’s “Bye Bye Bye” changes everything. By 7:26 a.m. the room is packed and the party has started.
“Can I see a bit of engagement and hope from your entire body,” yells the emcee, the first of a seemingly endless stream of aphorisms. A dance circle emerges, led by dancers too polished to be here of their own volition. iPhone cameras flash almost constantly; everyone is Snapchatting as if their lives depend on it. One dancer yanks off tear-away pants, another spins on his head.
The emcee continues, “Do I got MIT in the house?” An unsynchronized, soft cheer is heard above the din of “Oops, I Did it Again.”
“I expect for you to be leaders on the dance floor.”
Taking this invitation to heart, a group of college-aged males push their way to the center of the circle. They’re very enthusiastic—are they planted dancers? Are we in the matrix?
“Happy Purim to the Jews!” the emcee shouts.
A man in a full body Godzilla suit (including mask) and a young woman dance in a tight embrace reminiscent of Guillermo Del Toro’s  “The Shape of Water.”
We glance at our phones. It’s only 7:42 a.m.
On the other side of the room a woman in an NPR shirt dances furiously, and a tall, bald man in a TEDxHonolulu tee moves slowly and gracefully to the throbbing bass. A woman we had spoken with earlier spots us and asks if we’re enjoying ourselves. We sputter out a response. “I can see it in your face,” she says with a wide grin.
Sensing a lull in the action after a spontaneous round of limbo, the 90s’-clad mischief makers—members of the collective that organize Daybreaker—emerge with a large multicolored tarp. They lift the rainbow parachute above the audience, evoking memories of first grade P.E. class. A single couple locks lips on the outskirts of the ring as everyone else jumps underneath the billowing fabric.
Not five minutes after the parachute appears, the mischief makers whisk it away. The Spice Girls’ “Wannabe” shakes the dance floor, and the bongo-drum toting emcee shimmies over to us. He thrusts a microphone in our faces, encouraging us to sing along with a toothy grin. The lyrics escape us. Zig-a-zig… ah?
It’s getting late—almost 8:45 a.m.—and the crowd thins as people make their way to their morning shifts.
Mischief makers hand out intention cards: well-designed cardstock squares emblazoned with the question “How will you stay wild?” and a quote from Victoria Erickson. Erickson is a creative writing coach, holistic health guru, and a “grounded idealist,” according to a cursory Google search.
“Give yourselves a round of applause,” says the emcee. He proceeds to instruct all those remaining to ignore the thin layer of stickiness on the ground and take a seat. “This is our sweat. We did this, we made this.” We read the quote on the back of the intention card in unison before being sent forward into our day.
On the T ride home, we dig our intention cards out of our pockets—“How will you stay wild?” The quote seemed believably magical when read sitting on the floor of a dimly lit club next to a man in a sailor costume. In the light of day, headed to our 10 a.m. sections, the carefully orchestrated wildness of Daybreaker already seems a distant memory. We are left with Britney lyrics ringing in our ears and a deep sense of physical weariness. Now, it isn’t so much a question of staying wild as staying awake.

*Is “explainer journalism” obnoxious? Basically, we got a bunch of people who know way more about this topic than we do to explain it to us, so we can tell you about it.
If there’s one thing the two retired auditors at the back of your English class, Google, and the Mayor of Cambridge will definitely agree on, it’s that housing is just too expensive in Cambridge.
In an interview with Fifteen Minutes, Mayor Marc C. McGovern lamented the state of housing in Cambridge.
“We have people everyday who come into this office begging for housing,” McGovern says. “And I have to look at them and say ‘In two years, that project will be done and maybe you’ll get a place.’ I’m sick of saying that to people.”
It’s not a particularly new problem — rent has been increasing relentlessly in the area since the mid-90s — nor is it unique to Cambridge. Pick up a dart and throw it at any major metropolitan area on the Eastern seaboard and you’ll likely encounter a region struggling to manage its housing costs. For a city like Cambridge, walled on either side by some of the largest and richest research universities in the country, the problem seems especially salient and complex.
Depends on who you ask.
The City of Cambridge designates “affordable housing” for tenants or homeowners that shell out less than 30 percent of their income for housing costs. The designation almost overwhelmingly affects low-to-moderate income families.
However you slice it, “affordable” means a different thing depending on who you ask. It goes without saying that what’s affordable for a tenured faculty member is not the same as what’s affordable for a unionized clerical worker, or even a graduate student for that matter. The term gets even more complicated when you consider the bearing that other factors like family size, personal health, and commuting costs have on the affordability of a location.
As anyone who has taken Ec 10 knows, it all ties back to the market. The simple answer? Demand is high, but supply is low.
Cambridge is an increasingly attractive locale for a population trending downwards in age. A burgeoning biotechnology scene and the presence of several universities attracts 20-somethings fresh from college who are either seeking to deploy their new degrees at an edgy start-up or continue their education. Unlike their parents, millennials are staying in cities longer—traveling, working, and being single—instead of buying homes.
Harvard is also a major part of the allure. It’s a big employer that attracts a wide array of people: unionized workers, graduate students, lecturers, and tenured professors.
But the requisite supply of housing just isn’t there. Due to a combination of zoning laws and lack of available land, the amount of non-Harvard housing being built simply isn’t matching the interest levels. “On the regulatory side, a lot of zoning is necessary and too much. Those costs limit where you can build, and how much you can build,” says Jennifer H. Molinsky, a Senior Research Associate at Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Would you believe us if we told you it is as self-explanatory as it seems? Essentially, when the government places restrictions on the amount a landlord can charge tenants for rent, that policy is called rent control.
Rent control was the standard in three Massachusetts cities—Brookline, Boston, and Cambridge—up until the mid-90s. In 1994, residents across the state narrowly voted in favor of a referendum that eliminated the policy state-wide. Consequently, a 1970 mandate in Cambridge—which placed limits on rent in buildings constructed before 1969—was abolished.
The 1994 referendum gave landowners much reason to rejoice. Under rent control, property owners were forced to lease houses at a rate 25-40 percent less than they otherwise could have, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The value of their property had depreciated severely in the years between the 1970 mandate and its abandonment in 1994.
The repeal of rent control policies across the state reversed this trend dramatically—housing valuations spiked by 1.8 billion between 1994 and 2004—but gave way to a new host of challenges. How could residents who relied on these rent-controlled properties keep up with exploding prices?
After rent control was abolished, rents in Cambridge jumped by more than 50 percent between 1994 and 1997. Twenty-four years later, rents are still on the rise.
There are two primary ways to lower the cost of housing: (1) lower the market rate price and (2) create more designated affordable housing units. It sounds simple, but politicians and economists don’t exactly agree on how to reach these ends. Easier said than done, right?
So how can Cambridge lower the market-rate price of its housing?
“The standard economic answer would be that if you want to bring down the cost of housing, you have to expand supply,” Chris Herbert, the managing director of Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, says. “The question is whether or not you can achieve development at a scale in Cambridge that will actually result in us seeing market rates come down.”
Cambridge’s two major housing advocacy groups, A Better Cambridge and Cambridge Residents Alliance, would likely disagree on the validity of Herbert’s answer. In fact, the biggest distinction between the two groups is their stance on the market’s role in addressing housing demand in Cambridge. ABC strongly supports private development to increase housing supply and lower prices, whereas CRA is generally satisfied with rates of market-rate development. More on that later.
The other option is to just create more affordable housing units; both ABC and CRA support this solution. That means the city would have to allocate more money for affordable housing. Right now, it primarily comes from (a) individuals, via low-income housing tax credits which incentivize people to invest in the development of affordable housing (b) organizations or nonprofits, and (c) Cambridge’s affordable housing trust, which raises money for these projects.
The city allocates vouchers, both to properties and to individuals. Project-based vouchers are given to development sites, and individual vouchers are given to low- or middle-income residents who qualify. That way, constituents that live in affordable housing will only pay, at most, 30 percent of their income.
Cambridge has two primary nonprofit organizations completely dedicated to lobbying for, building, and maintaining affordable housing complexes throughout the city: Just-A-Start and Cambridge Housing Authority. JAS owns 594 units of affordable housing and CHA has built 399 units, with 40 more on the way. Both are continuing to acquire new properties.
When the affordable developers bid for a property, they have to put together a projection for the city of Cambridge that balances their funding and the revenues from rent with the cost of building and operating the development. Even with all the financial support, the price of land is so high that affordable housing developers often lose money and take on debt. Many of their proposals aren’t approved.
Private developers are also required by Cambridge to ensure that 20 percent of the housing they build is “affordable” by the city’s definition.
Either way, it seems like the answer is build, build, build.
In Cambridge, ABC and CRA each advocate for a different solution.
ABC advocates for the production of more housing—period. It was founded several years ago by Cambridge native Jesse Kanson-Benanav, a project manager for an affordable development organization in Somerville. ABC wants to see more housing developments, both 100 percent affordable and mixed-income complexes. As Kanson-Benanav says, ABC is a strong advocate for affordable housing development, but “we also do believe that private developers that do majority market-rate housing have a role to play in meeting demand for market rate housing and giving back to the community through affordable housing.” In short, ABC believes that increasing the amounts of both market-rate and affordable housing will lower the costs of housing overall.
In contrast, members of CRA, founded by Cantabrigian Lee Farris, believe that the primary solution should be creating more affordable housing complexes. “We don’t think you need to do anything to encourage market-rate housing because I don’t think Cambridge has a lack of housing being built,” Farris explains. “It’s a question of whether you think the market just needs minor adjustments, or whether you think the market is broken and needs to be fixed.” While CRA advocates have historically supported certain instances of private development, they generally believe that increasing market-rate housing won’t sufficiently stymie demand. What’s really needed, they argue, are zoning policies that benefit affordable housing developers, giving them a leg up over private developers in buying land.
Each election season, the two advocacy groups each endorse a different slate of candidates. Housing is typically a hot-button issue in the race, and the City Council electees are typically split between both organizations. This year, CRA’s candidates earned four seats and ABC’s earned three seats.
Though each organization has drastically different principles, both founders agree they share the same overall vision for the city. “We are working for a livable, affordable, diverse Cambridge,” Farris says. “The ultimate goal for both organizations is to build a Cambridge that is inclusionary of everyone and is affordable for everyone,” Kanson-Benanav says.
The Cambridge City Council’s biggest move towards a solution came in November when they voted to increase the number of “inclusionary” housing units mandated in Cambridge. Zoning ordinances have, since the late 90s, required that properties with ten or more units allocate a portion of those units for “low- and moderate-income tenants or moderate and middle-class tenants.” The November vote boosted that requirement up to 20 percent. Both ABC and CRA endorsed the change.
The City Council has also been involved in lobbying for universities, primarily MIT, for more graduate student housing. MIT filed a rezoning petition to redevelop a large piece of land in Kendall Square where the Volpe Transportation Systems Center currently operates. The Council approved MIT’s proposal, but they also supported a MIT graduate student petition calling for the University to turn some of that land into graduate student housing. Ultimately, MIT agreed to a net increase of 250 graduate student beds. According to Jan Devereux, Cambridge vice mayor, the Council lacks the grounding to encourage Harvard to undertake a similar endeavor since Harvard is expanding in Allston, on the other side of the Charles River.
Everything. Think about it this way: Harvard is a big draw for the city of Cambridge. New residents are drawn en masse by its scholarship, research, and employment opportunities. Recent data from the 2017 Town Gown report, an annual snapshot of Harvard’s “presence” in the city, shows that some 25,000 Harvard affiliates—including faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students—are spread out across the city in a mix of University-affiliated and non-University-affiliated housing.
For many of the 12,000 Harvard staff members who live in Cambridge, the affordable housing crisis is a real issue with daily implications. Their ability to reside in proximity to the University impacts how and when they work, so Harvard has a real stake in the process.
Harvard has taken an active role in addressing the housing crisis by helping to build and preserve Cambridge’s affordable housing. Seventeen years ago, the university launched the 20/20/2000 initiative, committing $20 million over 20 years to establish low-interest loans for affordable housing units throughout every neighborhood in Cambridge. So far, $14.6 million of Harvard’s money has supported affordable housing. More than 1657 units across 33 projects in Cambridge were renovated or developed with Harvard’s money. And even though it’s not in Cambridge, Harvard’s new SEAS campus is slated to include affordable housing units for city locals.
That said, many experts and Cantabrigians say that Harvard, at least indirectly, has been contributing to the problem. One reason, says Chris Herbert, the managing director of the Joint Center for Housing studies, is that the Harvard graduate student population is increasing but the amount of graduate student housing isn’t. “That adds to demand in the housing market,” he explains. “Graduate students can live together with other graduate students, pool together their resources, and have more effective demand than families can—driving prices up.”
Herbert suggested that, as a result, universities have an “obligation to provide housing opportunities for grad students.” That’s something that both Farris from CRA and Kanson-Benanav from ABC have agreed on.
In an emailed statement, Ann P. Hall, the Director of Communications for GSAS, wrote that “the GSAS Office of Residential Life manages four residence halls, which provide affordable, on-campus housing for graduate students.”
Just under half of the University’s buildings are used for housing. Harvard houses 98 percent of its undergraduates, and has the capacity to house 48 percent of its graduate students, which to some degree reduces the amount of non-Cantabrigians flooding the market.

–“The Script,” 2013
Sometime in my sophomore year of high school, a couple of friends and I began to write a rom-com. The idea was to take “Superbad,” but make it badder. We were the main characters, of course, and we wrote ourselves into the three most charmingly awkward, witty, and resourceful 16-year-olds on the planet. We got the girls we’d never talked to. We caricatured the hell out of people we didn’t like. We always said the perfect things.
Its codename was “The Script,” and it started out as an exercise in teenage passion. But it soon became a little more than that. At one point, we were talking about things that had transpired in our story—car chases in a neighboring town, extra-dramatic band practices, intoxicating romances after midnight—as if they had actually happened. (None of us had our licenses, band was our most boring class, and we were all painfully single.)
As we grew a little older, these elements began to shift, and “The Script” became the obvious point of comparison, the North Star to which growing up pointed. And more often than not, after nights of reckless driving, friend group drama, and talking to girls who actually knew who we were, I would walk home under the moonlight, disquieted by the sense that I’d seen all of this happen somewhere before.
The best analogy I can give you for this pseudo déjà vu is the experience of riding in a car with the windows down. Imagine the radio music dancing at you, smudged by the wind and the roadscapes that skip by. Your sunglasses are on, and you’re smiling. With friends. The sun is out, and the opposite of anxiety saturates the air.
The reason you’d notice a moment like this—the riding-in-a-car moment—is because it feels like it’s right out of a road movie. Something about noticing that you’re riding in a car has a cinematic quality that makes it interesting and memorable in a way it otherwise couldn’t be. Which makes sense: It’s exciting to feel like you’re living in a movie moment.
But where did that movie moment come from? You could say that someone wrote it down and decided to film it long ago, before it entered the cultural consciousness. But knowing that doesn’t make it any easier to imagine what made the first riding-in-a-car moment special.
It might help to look at the first movie moment ever. In Jan. 1896, Auguste and Louis Lumière showed “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station” at a theatre in Paris. “Arrival of a Train” is a 50-second short film of a train pulling into a station, as you might guess from the name. It’s not impressive by today’s standards, but the story goes that audience members sitting in the front rows ducked when the train pulled in towards the screen, setting a precedent for the sort of reality-bending work movies have done since.
That the Lumière brothers were inspired by the experience of watching a train needs no explanation, but it’s important to note that the moment that stuck to our cultural memory was the movie version. Once you’ve seen “Arrival of a Train,” every train afterwards, from the Hogwarts Express to the trains that pull daily into Grand Central Station, follows in its echo. It’s not for no reason that IMAX’s first full-length animated 3D feature was “The Polar Express.” And after you’ve watched the riding-in-a-car moment in “Bonnie and Clyde,” or even “The Hangover,” every riding-in-a-car moment you experience becomes derivative of that template.
There’s something about the process of moviefying that transmutes ordinary experiences—like riding in a car or watching a train—into experiences that define other experiences. Which, if you think about it, has really disturbing implications. It means that every awful breakup is a shadow of “500 Days of Summer.” Every struggle to start up a company parrots “The Social Network.” Every cruise you go on is a ghost of “Titanic.” The glittering idea that there are new possibilities in the world grows exceedingly bleak when you realize that most of the important moments you’ve gone through and will go through have already been shown in a movie.
Art imitates life, but life imitates art, too. Yet art and life aren’t the only players in the imitation game—the rest of us, caught inside, can’t be hopelessly stuck. There must be some way we can break out.
One option, if you don’t want to feel like an echo, is to avoid watching movies. But I imagine that’s impractical. Pop music, books, and all the other materials of popular culture do the same definitional work that movies do, if to different degrees.
Another option is to play the game. Last winter, I went back to my hometown and saw my high school friends for the first time in a while. It had been four years since we started and ended “The Script,” yet funnily enough, the essential arcs of our lives bent surprisingly close towards what it augured: “Kirk” became the type who went to parties; “Zachariah” went through a few relationships, or at least the motions; and I wrote.
Before I started this piece, I often wondered about the forces that engineered these uncanny evolutions. I suspect now that it was us all along. We wrote a script for a world we liked better. Life simply followed it.

The signature move of Chris A. Ricciotti, founder and head organizer of the Boston Gender-Free Contra Dancers, is to call dances from the floor. His very contemporary headset mic, which he uses to maintain mobility, is juxtaposed with his very 19th-century newsboy cap. His bouncing tonal quality glides as effortlessly as he does, weaving through the long lines of dancers grouped together to form distinctive sets. Every person in the room of about 20 to 25 is operating within their own conception of gender expression: some dancers choose to wear long skirts and flowers in their beards, while others wear work shirts still marked with the unmistakable signs of a long day on the job.
“I want to be with the people, which really helps me focus on what’s going on,” Ricciotti says, as though it were the obvious choice.
Ricciotti has been “with the people” since 1988, when BGLTQ-identifying Boston residents first gathered at the First Church in Jamaica Plain, between Pondside and J.P. South. The group he heads now is here to dance contra, a form of social folk dancing with Scottish and French origins dating back to the 17th century. In a contra dance, participants are organized in couples that form sets of two in lines that stretch down the length of the dance hall.
It is beautifully ironic that the gender-free contra-dance—a rebellion against tradition and norms—takes place in an 18th-century church.
Ricciotti says the sense of egalitarianism that drives him today stems from the fact that he didn’t always find it in spaces he’d been in before. “There was a gay men's social group I belonged to [in the late ’80s],” he says. “I found out being in the bars is mostly like being in a high school locker room. There are hierarchies and stupid rules—people were always complaining that there was nothing to do.”
And so, Ricciotti created a space for others to dance freely, without “hierarchy or stupid rules,” as a community. The group was originally called the Jamaica Plain Lesbian and Gay Contra Dancers, and it has expanded over the years to welcome queer people of all identities into the community under the “gender-free” umbrella.
The language utilized in the space has similarly evolved over time. The traditional, gendered terms of “ladies” and “gents” has been replaced by gender-neutral terms. In the early years, the group used “arm-bands” and “bare-arms” to distinguish between the two roles. This idea had its limitations: individuals were less likely to change roles throughout the dance because they had to wear “armbands” throughout the entire dance. Because of this, members of the organization decided to switch up the labels again. Now, the group refers to the roles as “ravens” and “larks,” with ravens on the right, following the larks who lead on the left.
“The change in terminology was not something that came from me initially,” Ricciotti says. “It came from a need in the community to make the dancing more accessible and less gender-identified so they could feel more comfortable.”
According to Ricciotti, dialogue traditionally existing in this world of contra—permitted intimacy, sexual assault, and the gendering of spaces—has now reached the public sphere. More groups that do not refer to themselves as explicitly for the gender non-conforming community are taking on the terminology of gender-free dancing, he says.
The comfort and integrity of the contra dance lies largely in its sociality. In a contra dance, one interacts with everyone else in the set with moves that require actions typically reserved for one’s most intimate acquaintances: hand-holding, extended eye-contact, and the balancing of shared weight. But, in contra, dancers advance up and down the line until they have danced with everyone in the room. The intimacy is everywhere.
“In a contra dance, you can dance and touch every person in the hall by the end of the night, particularly if you are swapping roles. You can’t help but build community,” Ricciotti says.
And because one must focus intensely on the comfort of one’s partner in one’s desired role, Ricciotti says “there is a level of intimacy...permission to touch and connect and say hello. You walk into the room not knowing anyone and by the end of the dance, you know everyone.”
A moment that particularly stood out to Ricciotti was the memorial dance for Linda Leslie, a longtime caller and friend of the Boston Gender-Free Contra Dancers who passed on Feb. 11, 2018. The dance, attended by approximately 90 participants according to Ricciotti, magnified the intimate nature of the contra. “She was an advocate...generous with her mentorship and her time. [The dance] was an emphasis on who she was...a lovely tribute to her,” Ricciotti says.
This moment could easily be imbued with meaning from an outsider with reactionary interest; but members of the Boston Gender-Free Contra Dancers say this would be a grave mistake. What is significant about this moment, and the Boston Gender-Free dance community more broadly, is that it means a great deal to those living it. Ricciotti says it is not the most surprising or provocative aspects of the organization's nature that make it worth careful attention: it is the passion and warmth within the group that makes it a home.
Near the end of a meeting last month, then-Quincy House Representative Wyatt M. Robertson ’18 rose to address the Undergraduate Council, Harvard’s student governing body. In an at-times emotional speech, he announced he planned to step down from the UC.
But he had some parting advice: look to Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15.
Mayopoulos served as UC President in 2014; he won a surprise victory after running on a joke ticket that promised more tomato basil ravioli soup and thicker toilet paper. Nonetheless, though, Robertson said he thinks student engagement with and interest in the UC under Mayopoulos’s tenure was far greater than it is today.
He particularly pointed to a student rally organized by Mayopoulos and then-Council Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 in Feb. 2014 to demand a $250,000 increase in UC funding from the University. The rally drew roughly 100 students to the Yard—and ultimately helped secure more money for the Council.
“The student body was so involved with the UC because [the Council] shed all their formalities and they really got on a level with all the students,” Robertson said.
Now, though, Robertson and other representatives say they think the student body is growing increasingly disengaged with the Council. He and other Council members reference low voter turnout in recent years, arguing it reflects a broader lack of student engagement and stems in part from a failure on the part of the UC to communicate with the student body in a streamlined way.
The most recent Undergraduate Council presidential election—held Nov. 2017—saw the lowest-ever voter turnout since the Council first began electing its leadership via popular vote in 1996. Just 2,074 undergraduates voted in the election, a 32 percent decrease from the previous year.
Some on the Council also say they fear UC members themselves are becoming less engaged with the body and its work.
These worries are not new: the Council has grappled with a lack of engagement for years. At a meeting in late 2014, for example, UC representatives discussed whether structural problems within the body could be helping foster general apathy towards its work.
“I definitely see that there's an issue where the student body kind of does have this blasé towards the Undergraduate Council,” UC Secretary Jackson C. Walker ’21 said. “And I think that's in part due to our failure to communicate what we do on a regular basis.”
Amidst these concerns, UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 say they are taking steps to improve the Council’s communication with undergraduates.
“When we started our term, something that was really important to us is that we are interfacing with students, most importantly, and constituents,” Zhang said. “If we are not engaged with students, and not engaged with administrators, we are not doing our jobs.”
Mayapoulos’s Feb. 2014  rally failed to win explicit approval from administrators for the funding increase. But money nonetheless began to trickle in—funding that eventually helped free up some of the UC’s budget for other priorities.
Later that same year, the College provided $21,000 to support a UC initiative that promoted collaborative events between student groups and considered footing the bill for the funding of two student groups—Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors and the Phillips Brooks House Association—to which the UC had previously provided over $35,000 annually.
These tangible results may have drawn in part from visible student buy-in at the rally. Robertson says he thinks the level of student excitement seen during Mayopoulos’s term has largely disappeared—a change he lamented at the February UC meeting.
Mayopoulos declined a request for an interview Monday, saying he did not want to “interfere” with the Council’s current operations.
In recent years, many undergraduates have shown interest in specific UC initiatives, like the push for a multicultural center and a new UC-run program that facilitates faculty-to-student interactions over catered dinners. A January town hall about the proposed multicultural center, led by two Council members, drew over 70 attendees.
Nonetheless, some representatives point to last fall’s electoral turnout figures—as well as the larger downward trend in engagement—as proof the Council is now facing serious issues of student disengagement. Asked about possible reasons for the low voter turnout, at least two Council members said the apparent lack of enthusiasm from students could result from a deeper disconnect between representatives and their constituents.
“Too many students don’t necessarily know everything that the Council is working on, or just don’t know the scope of issues that we cover,” Education Committee Chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said. “So I think that kind of creates this disconnect where people maybe don’t feel as invested in what the UC is working on.”
Lowell House Representative Michael E. Scherr '20 said he thinks the UC's lack of focus on the day-to-day lives of undergraduates is eroding its influence among undergraduates.
“Over the past couple of years, the Undergraduate Council has been failing to act on things,” Scherr said. “They’ve been issuing a series of statements and endorsements that are important, but ultimately don’t really do a whole lot to impact the lives of students.”
“On the big issues here at Harvard, the Undergraduate Council consistently misses the ball,” he added.
In interviews this week, both Zhang and Boucher conceded the Council’s communication with the student body has been poor in the past. The duo said they are seeking to improve the situation; in one example, they are working to debut a new Council website meant to better facilitate the dissemination of information and College resources.
Zhang also argued the lower turnout can at least partly be attributed to issues with the voting system.
“I can’t even tell you how many students came up to me and said that they were so frustrated with the voting system and that they just stopped even trying to vote,” Zhang said. “So that was honestly really frustrating during the election, just hearing how many people just got disengaged because of technology troubles.”
Even putting aside last year’s especially low figure, though, turnout for UC presidential elections has been trending downward for years.
In six of the seven elections between 2004 and 2010, over 3,500 students cast ballots. Only once since then—in 2012—has turnout again surpassed that figure.
The Council has been forced to respond to this continually low turnout. Prior to last year, UC-sponsored referenda could only be considered binding if a majority of undergraduates voted in November elections. But the Council scrapped that requirement last year following two consecutive years in which a majority of the student body did not cast ballots.
In addition to external student disengagement, the UC may also be facing lowered internal enthusiasm. A perceived lack of engagement on the part of some Council members has caused tension on the UC during general—meaning body-wide—meetings this year.
Zhang announced in January that general meetings—which begin at 7 p.m. most Sundays—would conclude at 9 p.m., barring successful motions to extend them.
On multiple occasions this semester, the Council has voted down motions that sought to extend meetings to permit members to finish voting on scheduled legislation.
Tensions boiled over at last Sunday’s meeting—the body’s last before the College’s scheduled spring break—after the Council voted down two such motions. As a result, two pieces of legislation were tabled, including one that would have subsidized bicycles for low-income students in the Quad.
The second vote to extend the meeting ended in a tie. Amid some confusion about whether the Council would consider a further motion brought by Winthrop House Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Zhang broke the tie and ended the meeting.
The exchange prompted Bonsall to sharply criticize the UC’s leadership, arguing that not extending the meeting represented a failure of the Council to serve the student body.
“What are we doing as UC reps, if we, not only the leadership of this organization, but also the collective membership, vote to not do our jobs?” he asked the Council. “Can we please be responsible?”
In an email sent to Council members after the meeting, Pforzheimer House Representative Rainbow Yeung ’19, an inactive Crimson blog editor, repeated Bonsall’s concerns.
“I am incredibly disappointed by the lack of commitment and the general laziness of the Council, not only from members at large, but also (especially) from our leadership,” wrote Yeung, who co-sponsored the bicycle legislation.
Zhang said in an interview Tuesday that she decided to end the meeting in order to make sure representatives wouldn’t miss their scheduled office hours and to “honor” the vote earlier in the evening in which the Council had struck down a similar motion.
“When it ended up being a tie, I said, ‘Let me honor what was originally voted by members in this Council,’” Zhang said.
In addition, attendance at certain general and committee meetings has been somewhat spotty so far this semester. At multiple committee meetings this semester—including two Rules Committee meetings—legislation could not be considered because quorums were not met, according to Rules Committee Chair Wilfried J. K. Zibell ’21.
Attendance at general meetings is in line with those of the past two semesters, according to records provided by former UC Secretary Ruiqi He ’19. Four representatives have missed three or more meetings within the first six of this term so far, compared to three last fall and two last spring.
Zhang and Boucher say they are working to improve the Council’s communication with undergraduates and to more stringently enforce attendance requirements for UC members.
The pair particularly referenced their planned overhaul of the Council’s website—one of the duo’s key campaign promises, which they said they will debut in the coming weeks. The redesign will provide students with a platform to better connect with not only the Council but also the vast resources of the College, according to Zhang and Boucher.
Last year, the UC’s leadership renewed efforts to enforce the Council’s requirement, outlined in its bylaws, that representatives hold weekly office hours. This semester, at least one representative from each house and freshman yard will sit in a central location—usually a dining hall—after general meetings to meet with constituents. At a recent meeting, the Council passed funding slated to allow for food and raffles at office hours.
Though some representatives say they have had trouble attracting students to their office hours, even a small amount of engagement with constituents is important, Boucher argued.
“One thing that we hear more than anything else is, ‘I like having the exposure to the UC,’ or ‘I like hearing what the UC is doing,’” Boucher said. “We want to make sure that the UC is not only accessible but is visible.”
Zhang also highlighted the Council’s new centralized email system, which she said will “streamline” the Council’s communication with students. The new system will feature a weekly email from the UC to all undergraduates containing updates about key UC initiatives.
Still, the duo said there are areas for improvement.
Boucher says he thinks the Council could do a better job of “branding.” Students often are unaware that events they attend are funded in part by the UC’s Finance Committee, he said.
“One of the stipulations on getting those grants, is that you’re supposed to put the little UC logo, on, say, the program to your event, or on the poster or the flyer,” said Boucher. “And things like that where the UC is having a tangible influence is not always visibly tied to the UC.”
At its Wednesday meeting, the Finance Committee considered a change to the policy guide requiring flyers for UC-funded events to include the Council’s logo, but failed to implement any changes.
“We all agree that some change will be made, but we don’t know exactly what it would be,” committee chair Henry Atkins ’20 said after the meeting.
In addition, Boucher said that, though past UC executive committees had only “loosely enforced” the official UC attendance policy, he plans to change that going forward.
The policy mandates that committee members who miss more than three meetings in one semester be placed “under review.” If the UC representative under review is not “exonerated,” the Council’s leadership must expel that individual from the Council and enforce that expulsion until fall elections of the following school year, according to the UC’s constitution and bylaws.
“We are actively choosing to enforce it this year,” Boucher said. “The reality is that Harvard students find themselves pulled in a lot of different directions but that is never an excuse for the UC.”
Despite what some call the Council’s communication troubles and the declining voting figures, Boucher insisted that the ability of the UC to improve the lives of students should not be underestimated. He recounted a Finance Committee meeting last year that he called the “most meaningful” he has experienced in his time on the UC.
“A student comes up to me...with tears in his eyes and he gives me a hug,” Boucher said. “And he says, ‘I just want to thank you, because your advocacy for giving us this funding meant that a group of people that would normally have no resources...was able to come together because of this.’”
“It was mind-blowing to me because the grant in question was some grant that was one of our smallest grants,” Boucher continued. “But yet something that small had the ability to move a person very dramatically.”

The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—will have an open seat on their 13-member board when Lawrence S. Bacow ascends to the Harvard presidency this summer.
The board comprises 12 members and the sitting University president. Bacow will take current Harvard President Drew G. Faust’s place on the Corporation when Faust steps down in June. 
Bacow has served on the Corporation since 2011. Along with his fellow Corporation members, he was initially a member of the search committee seeking Faust’s successor. Without public notification, Bacow stepped down from the committee in December and entered the search as a candidate for the 29th University president.
Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 referred in an emailed statement to the Corporation’s 2011 governance reforms as direction for the Corporation’s process of selecting a new member to replace Bacow.
“Since adoption of the governance reforms in 2011 and the creation of a new Corporation committee on governance, that committee has had an ongoing process to identify possible nominees for future Corporation appointments,” Lee wrote.
Lee said Corporation has employed the same process to search for replacements on the body “over the past several years.”
In an April 2017 interview, former Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane said the governance committee works with the Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—in this nominating process. A nominee must be voted in by both the Corporation and Board of Overseers to be installed to the Corporation.
“Both bodies have to vote, and, therefore, it’s in principle to include two or three members of the Board of Overseers, so they are part of the nominating process and can suggest names, and can react to possibilities, and ask their colleagues for some names,” Keohane said.
In addition to taking suggestions from the Board of Overseers, the Corporation’s nominating committee also solicits names from faculty and staff to “build a pool” of possible nominees, according to Keohane.
The Corporation employed their committee process in the nominations of billionaire philanthropist David M. Rubenstein and former Princeton University president Shirley M. Tilghman, according to Keohane. Rubenstein and Tilghman were installed as members of the Corporation in July 2017 and Jan. 2016, respectively.
Keohane said having a nominating committee helps the Corporation to “think about the strengths that we need to maintain.”
In the search for Bacow’s replacement, Lee called on Harvard affiliates to nominate individuals or provide advice to the Corporation via emails sent to corporationsearch@harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several new junior faculty members have recently joined the Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, according to Department Chair John H. Shaw.
Roger R. Fu ’09 and Rebecca A. Fischer began working as assistant professors of Earth and Planetary Sciences this past year, while Marine Denolle, another junior faculty member, began in Jan. 2016.
“This is my first faculty position,” Fischer said. “It’s a lot of new experiences kind of all at once: teaching for the first time, having grad students for the first time, setting up a lab. But it’s been really fun.”
This past fall, Fischer taught Earth and Planetary Sciences 142: “Mineralogy.” This spring, she is focusing on conducting research about processes in the earth’s interior during the planet’s formation.
Fischer said she enjoys the intellectual curiosity of EPS faculty.
“One of the things I really like about our department is the casual interactions that we have, both seriously or by the coffee machine on the fourth floor,” Fischer said. “People actually sit down and chat about science.”
Denolle has been in the EPS Department for two years, but she expressed equal enthusiasm about Earth and Planetary Sciences 55: “Earthquakes and Tectonics,” which she teaches during the fall and spring semesters.
“We’ve done fun lab experiments with shaking buildings, or creating earthquakes on a block on a board with springs to model the plate tectonics, and we build mountains with sandboxes,” Denolle said. “We also run some image processing using MATLAB scripting. So we’re bringing quantitative and qualitative skills to those labs.”
Shaw praised Denolle’s groundbreaking work in earthquake prediction.
“[Denolle] has pioneered the use of what we call seismic noise, which is all the stuff that we used to throw away on a seismogram that records earthquakes,” Shaw said. “It turns out to be a tremendously valuable resource. We can actually use it to simulate the ground shaking that’s going to occur in an earthquake before that earthquake even occurs.”
Fu said he uses the magnetic properties of rocks to understand magnetic fields in the deep past.
“If we look at ancient Earth rocks, we can do things like trace the motion of continents and plates because you can figure out the latitude that a rock formed at by using paleomagnetism,” he said. “You can also use it to understand the Earth’s magnetic field through time—if it varied more than now, whether it was weaker, or simply didn’t exist.”
A former EPS concentrator himself, who has taken many of the same classes as his students, Fu said he has a “better sense of what students know and don’t know.” He said this background has helped him better structure Earth and Planetary Sciences 120: “Introduction to Planetary Sciences,” the course he currently teaches, so it best fits his students’ needs.
“I took the earlier version of this class before, so I kind of cherry-picked the things I liked about it,” Fu said. “I also added some things, like the lab and the field trip [to look at rock formations in western Massachusetts and Connecticut].”
Above all, Fu said he is “really happy to be back” in the EPS Department.
“It’s a great department, and I’m happy to be promoting the next generation of geologists that come out of Harvard,” he said.

Melinda Barber, a managing director at Harvard Management Company—the University’s investment arm—will leave the University, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
Barber, who has worked at HMC since 2012, will move on to a position at Pilot House Associates, the family office of billionaire and former cable TV magnate Amos B. Hostetter Jr. Barber specializes in private equity and was promoted this year to her position of managing director at HMC, according to Bloomberg.
Her departure comes at a time when HMC’s CEO N. P. “Narv” Narvekar is reducing staff and shifting assets to external managers. Last month, the real estate team spun off to Bain Capital, and Harvard has invested in the hedge funds of former HMC money managers.
Last January, Narvekar announced he planned to cut HMC’s 230-person staff by more than half. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Narvekar has cut around 100 jobs since he joined HMC in late 2016.
Since taking over in Dec. 2016, Narvekar has also implemented a shift towards generalist management. Narvekar announced in his September letter to Harvard affiliates that managers formerly responsible for individual portfolios will be responsible for the entire portfolio and will be compensated based on overall returns.
HMC spokesperson Patrick Mckiernan declined to comment on Barber’s departure or the reductions in staff.

The Cambridge City Council voted unanimously to begin working on new laws and regulations regarding recreational cannabis at a meeting Monday.
The policy order, authored by Councillor Quinton Zondervan and Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui, addresses the need to enact policies regulating retail cannabis given statewide sales of recreational marijuana are set to be legalized on July 1. Recreational marijuana stores must apply for a license from the state Cannabis Control Commission by April 1.
Recreational marijuana was legalized across Massachusetts via a state ballot question, approved Nov. 2016 and effective Dec. 2016. Two years later, cities are finally starting to grapple with the new law, Councillor Craig Kelley said.
“It is something completely new for us to try and figure out,” Kelley said at the Monday meeting. “Where does it go? How do we fit these new uses, these new regulations, these new parts of an economy?”
The policy order adopted by the City Council begins to answer some questions surrounding implementation. Cambridge should enact “zoning and licensing” laws regulating marijuana stores while correcting previous “racial and economic injustices,” the order states.
One such issue stems from the use of the word “marijuana,” according to the order. The municipal legislation outlines what it dubbed the term’s “racist” origins in the early 20th century after former Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry J. Anslinger began using the word to falsely associate cannabis with Latino immigrants.
In response to this historical context, the council ordered that the City of Cambridge use the word “cannabis” when referring to the drug in official documentation.
The order also referenced a 2001-2010 ACLU study citing over 8 million arrests associated with marijuana. The report found a black person was almost four times more likely to be arrested than a white person, despite similar rates of cannabis usage.
Kelley asked the council to consider how Cambridge could adapt to the recent legalization, reminding the councillors of the drug’s disparate racial impacts on incarceration.
“It’s something that for years and years and years has been outlawed. It’s been criminalized. It’s put a defined segment of the population in very marginalized situations,” Kelley said.
Consequently, the order called for the city to draft regulations of cannabis “as quickly as possible” to prevent a delay in implementation that councillors said might perpetuate the disproportionate impacts of marijuana criminalization.
The Public Safety Committee is expected to discuss the recent legalization of recreational cannabis, according to the order. Vice Mayor Jan Devereux, a member of the Public Safety Committee, raised potential concerns over marijuana smoke in public.
“It is different and it is uncharted, so I think that is something we can certainly talk about, that balancing act at the Public Safety Committee,” Devereux said at the meeting Monday.

University President Drew G. Faust joined 48 other higher education leaders in penning a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday to express “deep objections” to the new federal tax on endowment returns and to ask Congress to “repeal or amend the tax.”
The letter, which includes signatures from every Ivy League university president except for Columbia’s—which does not currently qualify for this tax—specifically addresses the schools’ concerns about the tax’s potential to limit financial aid resources.
“[The tax] will constrain the resources available to the very institutions that lead the nation in reducing, if not eliminating, the costs for low- and middle-income students, and will impede the efforts of other institutions striving to grow their endowments for this very purpose,” the letter reads.
The 1.4 percent tax on endowment returns, a provision of the Republican-endorsed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December, applies to institutions of higher education whose endowment values amount to at least $500,000 per student. Harvard would have paid $43 million if the endowment tax were in effect for fiscal year 2017, according to an estimate offered by University Provost Alan M. Garber in November.
The letter concluded by urging congressional leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, to revisit what the document's authors called a “misguided” tax policy.
In the past, Faust has repeatedly denounced the tax and its expected impact on Harvard.
“What [the endowment tax] will do is put constraints on our ability to fund the variety of undertakings that are central to our mission—financial aid and research, public programs, the variety of endeavors across the University," Faust said in an interview in January. “Its ultimate impact will be on limiting the growth in the endowment, and the growth in the endowment is what funds the programs.”

Mass. Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Matthew A. Beaton questioned the Department of Transportation’s recent evaluation of Allston’s West Station, urging the agency to review the hub’s planned transit use and to consider an earlier construction timeline.
Beaton's calls echo suggestions previously put forth by Harvard administrators. In a Jan. 2018 letter to MassDOT Secretary Stephanie Pollack, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp proposed MassDOT “reconsider” delaying the construction of West Station to 2040.
The construction of West Station forms part of a larger project to realign the Mass. Turnpike in Allston.
In Jan. 2018, Harvard pledged $50 million to fund West Station, a commuter rail stop on the Framingham-Worcester line, and up to $8 million to help construct another, interim station in Allston.
The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Oct. 2014  announced plans to develop Harvard-owned land near Beacon Park Yard into West Station, a transit stop meant to connect Allston to downtown Boston and the greater Boston area. In late 2017, the agency wrote a Draft Environmental Impact Report and announced that it would delay construction of West Station from 2025 to 2040 due to financial concerns.
In recent months, Allstonians have rallied to protest vehicular traffic and promote public transit.
On Feb. 16, Secretary Beaton from the Mass. Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs authorized the environmental report. Beaton recommended MassDOT build an interim station earlier in the project.
Beaton wrote to summarize trends from his review of the more than 500 comment letters he received.
“The majority of commenters, including elected officials representing Boston, Brookline, and Cambridge, urge MassDOT to construct West Station in Phase 1 of the project based on its ability to support the project’s multi-modal transportation goals and local and regional transportation needs,” Beaton wrote.
Beaton also questioned MassDOT’s low ridership estimate for West Station, noting the popularity of the nearby station Boston Landing and asking the department to re-analyze ridership estimates for 2025 and 2040.
MassDOT spokesperson Patrick Marvin wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that, while working alongside the City of Boston and MBTA, MassDOT will perform additional analyses and complete two studies on possible transit services and ridership demand.
“The first of these will be a rapid, tactical examination of the existing impediments to reliable bus transportation through the Allston area, and the second will be a longer-term review of different potential land use scenarios and accompanying transit investments,” Marvin wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the University is happy with Secretary Beaton’s response.
“We’re pleased that Secretary Beaton has asked MassDOT to investigate implementing an interim West Station,” he wrote. “It is our hope that the review requested by the Secretary, along with Harvard’s financial contributions, will result in added public transit service to the area.”

Short-term renting may be the reason why a luxury residential complex in Allston has reached full capacity, according to a local real estate agent.
Continuum, a 325-unit residential and retail complex located on Harvard-owned land by Barry’s Corner, offers one, two and three-bedroom apartments. After it began leasing units in Aug. 2015, Continuum initially struggled to fill its residential spaces. In Oct. 2015, 23 percent of the housing units had been leased to residents, and in Feb. 2016, that number rose to 40 percent.
Kevin Cleary, a real estate agent for Re/Max in Boston, said he thinks Continuum has been leasing residential units to third-party investors. He said this maneuver would allow third parties to list the apartments as short-term rentals, which permit individuals to lease a unit for fewer than 30 consecutive days.
Molly Kalan, a marketing activations and PR manager for Samuels & Associates— a firm Harvard chose as the developer of the property in 2012—wrote in an emailed statement that the “vast majority” of tenants at Continuum are long-term renters.
But Continuum does rent out units to third-party operators, according to Kalan.
Cleary said he thinks short-term rentals—which he called a new phenomenon in Allston—may allow Continuum to boast “artificially” low vacancy rates.
Calling the strategy “convenient,” Cleary said he believes leasing apartments to third-party operators allows Continuum to continue to ask for high rents for its apartments. As of 2015, the average rent for an apartment in Boston was $2,100, around $200 less than the price of a studio apartment in Continuum.
“Most landlords don’t want to have short-term renters in their building—it’s just not good turnover, you have the wear and tear and all that,” Cleary said. “But in buildings like Continuum, if you can rent large blocks of apartments to a third-party operator, then that’s their responsibility.”
Kalan, though, wrote in her email that short-term rentals form a logistical necessity.
“Because of the close proximity of the building to the colleges, healthcare organizations, and large businesses of Cambridge and Boston, as well as public transit options, there is interest from a wide array of individuals... for shorter periods in conjunction with business needs or executive education programs,” Kalan wrote in her email. “We do provide leases to operators to support that need.”
The topic of short-term rentals is not only impacting Allston, but is also sparking conversations in the surrounding area about the housing market.
In Jan. 2018, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh submitted an ordinance to the City Council meant to establish guidelines for short-term rentals in the area.
“We know that the unchecked commercialization of short-term rental uses in residential properties has potential to increase pressure on our already strained housing market,” he wrote in the ordinance. “This ordinance outlines reasonable restrictions on short-term rental uses designed to mitigate the loss of long-term housing units to a short-term market.”

Worker cooperatives are a viable alternative to corporate capitalism, yet they are rarely brought up in political discourse, two speakers at a Harvard Law Forum event argued Wednesday.
Nathan Schneider, an assistant professor of media studies at University of Colorado Boulder, and Jason Wiener, a worker cooperative lawyer, came to the Law School to argue the case for democratic cooperatives—speaking on how they work, why they’re important, and why so few people have heard of them.
Both Schneider and Wiener said they have made it their professional goal to advance worker cooperatives as an alternative to traditional capitalism.
“We need to convince people that the model that exists [of co-ops] is readily adoptable,” Wiener said.
Harvard Law Forum President Peter D. Davis ’12 said the talk aimed to explore one way to approach a larger dilemma. “If you don’t like state communism, and you don’t like corporate capitalism, what do you like?”
Schneider and Wiener both proposed their favored solution: democratic worker cooperatives. In a co-op, a company’s workers run their business democratically instead of placing investors in charge.
“I call it the iPhone of business models—it should be as intuitive and self-explanatory as possible. But we have to deprogram so much conventional wisdom and conventional learning,” Wiener said.
Schneider’s talk looked specifically at local control, fair bureaucracies, and protecting the rights of creators. Wiener focused more on logistics, including cooperatives’ taxes and the history of co-op law.
Naushard Cader, a Harvard graduate student who attended Wednesday’s event, said he thinks the co-op discussion is an important one.
“I think it is fantastic, and something that is actually taking place across the country and the world,” he said. “It’s very timely to talk about this particular topic.”
Both Wiener and Schneider highlighted how underrepresented co-ops are in current political discussions.
“I don’t think I heard the word ‘cooperative’ while I was in law school,” Wiener said, garnering a few laughs from the law student-heavy audience.
Davis said he hopes Wednesday’s event changed that—and helped get the word out.
“We had a full house. I’m always happy when the public is here, and there were a lot of people who were from out of Harvard Law School,” Davis said. “I hope that people walk away today thinking that there are more possibilities than they thought before.”
Another audience member, Tracy Bindel, said she did.
“I was really excited that this event was here at Harvard today,” Bindel said. “I really appreciated learning much more about the government structures and alternative co-op models that exist.”

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton will receive the Radcliffe Medal on May 25, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study announced in a press release Thursday.
According to the press release, the Institute will present Clinton with the award on Radcliffe Day, an annual celebration held during commencement week.
Past medalists include U.S. Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor, tennis player Billie Jean King, writer Toni Morrison, and University President Drew G. Faust.
The annual event will begin with a panel called “Toward a New Global Architecture? America’s Role in a Changing World.” Kennedy School Professor Nicholas Burns will moderate the panel, which will also feature Michèle A. Flournoy, David R. Ignatius, Meghan L. O’Sullivan, and Anne-Marie Slaughter.
Former U.S. Secretary of State and Radcliffe Medal recipient Madeleine K. Albright will deliver a tribute to Clinton, followed by a conversation with Mass. Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92.
Radcliffe Institute Dean Lizabeth Cohen praised Clinton’s accomplishments in an emailed statement.
“We selected Secretary Clinton in recognition of her accomplishments in the public sphere as a champion for human rights, as a skilled legislator, and as an advocate for global American leadership,” she wrote.
Asked how the 2016 election influenced the Institute’s decision, Cohen pointed to the importance of persevering through setbacks and losses.
“We recognize in her a model of what it takes to transform society: a lifetime of relentless effort combined with the vision and dedication to overcome one’s inevitable defeats,” she wrote.
According to Cohen, senior Institute staff partner with internal and external advisers to choose each year’s medalist.
The Institute’s website states that the medal is awarded to a person “who has had a transformative impact on society.” It is usually—but not always—given to a woman, though former University President Derek C. Bok received the medal in 1991.
Clinton’s acceptance of the medal will not be her first time visiting Harvard since the election. Last March, she came to campus to speak about her time as Secretary of State and to attend a luncheon at Kirkland House.

Staff for Harvard’s most popular Computer Science class have changed the way they report academic dishonesty cases to the Honor Council roughly a year after a wave of cheating in Computer Science 50 swept the class and stretched the Council to its limits.
Course staff also for the first time “collaborated” with an “academic integrity fellow” on issues of “academic honesty” every single week of the past fall semester, course head David J. Malan ’99 announced in a blog post Tuesday.
The Crimson reported in May 2017 that over 60 CS50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” students—roughly 10 percent of the course’s total fall 2016 enrollees—appeared before the Honor Council to face charges of academic misbehavior.
In the wake of the cheating scandal, CS50 drew criticism from students and Honor Council members for staffers’ method of reporting all allegations of cheating in one batch at the end of the semester. Under this system, Malan did not check for cheating until near the end of the fall semester, when he ran an algorithm that flagged potential plagiarism, according to five current and former staffers.
Undergraduates and at least one member of the Honor Council said this method of checking for cheating caused CS50 Honor Council cases to take longer than other cases. Current and former course staff also said they believed this method disadvantaged enrollees, meaning students remained in the dark about possible violations of course policy for months.
Now, Malan has updated the way he and course staff report allegations of cheating to the Honor Council, according to his post. He wrote Tuesday that the majority of fall 2017 CS50 Honor Council cases were “referred within days of the submissions in question,” rather than together at the end of the term.
Malan detailed the responsibilities of the new academic integrity fellow—Erin Carvalho, a preceptor in Harvard's Division of Continuing Education—and explained she is also working with other Computer Science courses across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in addition to CS50.
Carvalho serves as the “primary point person for preemptive conversations” and “students’ confidant” in CS50, according to Malan.
Malan wrote he thinks some of the changes to the course last semester—particularly Carvalho’s involvement—helped reduce the number of CS50 students referred to the Honor Council for academic dishonesty between fall 2016 and fall 2017. Last semester, just 29 students appeared before the Council, representing roughly four percent of total course enrollees.
In a blog subsection titled “From Reactive to Proactive,” Malan called the reduction in cheating allegations “leaps forward.”
CS50 is also updating its penalties for late assignments, according to Malan’s blog post. Under a new policy slated to debut in fall of 2018, course staff will “minimize or waive” penalties given to students who request extensions specifically to avoid the temptation to cheat, Malan wrote.
The new lateness policy is inspired in part by a “near occasion of sin” policy previously instituted in a Princeton Computer Science course, according to Malan’s Tuesday post. The rule—established by Princeton professor Christopher Moretti—allows students to receive extensions with little or no penalty if they email the professor and explain they need more time because they will otherwise feel tempted to cheat.
“Christopher shared that he offers students faced with panic and temptation an even more proactive solution, this one for students themselves,” Malan wrote, referring to the “near occasion of sin” policy. “So will CS50 have something similar in Fall 2018.”
CS50’s current course syllabus already contains a “regret clause”—first introduced in fall 2014—that allows students who admit to cheating to avoid referral to the Honor Council if they self-report their dishonesty within 72 hours. Undergraduates who report themselves are subject only to “local sanctions,” including a possible failing grade on the assignment in question.
The update to lateness penalties follows several other changes to CS50 course policy Malan made in Sept. 2017. Malan recommended that enrollees attend class—rather than watching lecture videos—and announced that CS50 would be graded on a “Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory” basis by default, though students could elect to take the course for a letter grade if they wished.
Malan also required as part of these changes that students attend a session in part dedicated to discussion of “how to navigate issues of academic honesty” before the start of the fall 2017 semester.
In his blog post Tuesday, Malan also published data detailing the exact number of CS50 students referred to the Honor Council—or the Administrative Board, which adjudicated academic dishonesty cases until 2015—for every year since 2007. The number consistently ranged from around 10 to 30 individuals, but in fall 2016 it surpassed 70, confirming The Crimson’s May 2017 report.
Malan’s blog post also included data on the number of students who invoked the “regret clause.” Only seven students did so in 2016, the year of the cheating scandal, compared to 26 in 2015—the most per year since the creation of the clause.
In the post, hosted on Medium, Malan wrote that CS50 “unfortunately” refers more students than any other Harvard course to the Honor Council.
Malan wrote he has “higher confidence” that the course would catch instances of cheating given recent changes he made to the course’s policies of checking assignments for improper collaboration.
Though he used to be the only staff member who reviewed potential cheating cases, in recent years, a “pipeline of multiple staff” has begun to look them over, too, he wrote.
Malan further detailed CS50’s process of checking for cheating in his post.
“For each problem set, the software ranks those pairs of submissions, with the most similar pairs up top,” he wrote. “With human eyes do we then review those ‘matches’ and decide if the similarities are indeed worrisome, unlikely to be the result of just chance.”
CS50 software and staff conducted 1,766,888 pairwise comparisons in fall 2016, according to his post.
The course’s 2016 cheating scandal also drew attention from University administrators. At CS50’s newly required orientation session this past fall, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris—whom Malan described as a “surprise” visitor—implored students not to cheat.
“No one should leave this room not understanding 100 percent what it is that you may and may not do in this course,” Harris said, adding he thinks cheating is “boneheaded.”

Atul A. Gawande, an award-winning author and a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, spoke candidly about the opioid epidemic—admitting he unknowingly played a part in the crisis—at an event held at the Institute of Politics Wednesday evening.
With torrential rain pouring outside, hundreds of raincoat-clad attendees flooded the event, titled “The State of Public Health.” Event moderator Cristine Russell, a fellow at the Belfer Center, asked Gawande about a series of topics ranging from gun violence to the opioid epidemic to unaffordable health care coverage.
Gawande said he has had direct experience prescribing  opioids.
“I had no idea. And I was handing it out with prescriptions which were giving people 50 pills when they would use three,” Gawande said, adding he thinks unused pills made their way to the black market.
Gawande said he thinks many doctors, himself included, were unaware of how addictive opioid prescription drugs could be.
“I can’t tell you how many people—I’ve been in practice since 2003—have said, ‘I don’t want to take the narcotics because I might get addicted. I knew someone who got addicted.’ And I would say, ‘You don’t have to worry. There’s no chance of addiction,’" Gawande said. " And the answer was was that if you took an opioid for one week, eight percent of people would be on that opioid one year later.”
Former Ohio governor Theodore “Ted” Strickland, who attended the event, said he thinks Gawande speaks about “difficult medical issues in a way that is easily understood.”
“He talks about [these issues] as a problem solver, and we need to listen to him, as a country and as a society. I think he has a voice that can lead us to making better decisions if we listen to his sage advice,” Strickland said.
Kathleen D. Malloch ‘18, who also attended the event, said she appreciated Gawande’s familiarity with the topics he discussed.
“I love that he had a ton of facts memorized that he could use at any moment," she said. "And he used them quite effectively to create arguments that were compelling.”
Another attendee, Lee Ann Song ‘15, said she found Gawande’s overall message very powerful.
Kennedy School professor David Ellwood said he most admired what he called Gawande’s ability to admit candidly to his past oversights.
Ellwood listed what he called Gawande's accomplishments: his skill at surgery, the many awards he has earned over the course of his career, and the four bestselling books he has written.
But Ellwood said he was most struck by three aspects of Gawande's personality.
“One is his heart. Second is his humility. And third is his humanity," Ellwood said. "Those things are in very short supply right now throughout the world."
Gawande concluded the conversation by giving advice to the younger people in the audience.
“Before the age of 40, say yes to everything, and after you’re 40, say no to everything,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s finance committee voted to recommend legislation that would bar religious group Harvard College Faith and Action from all Council funding at a weekly policy meeting Wednesday evening.
The motion, titled “An Act in Solidarity With the LGBTQ Community,” requires that HCFA leadership make “tangible” reforms before the group can—pending finance committee review—again receive UC funding. The act passed by a vote of 8-2, meaning it will be docketed by the UC’s executive team before appearing for a vote at the next UC general meeting, slated to be held  after spring break.
The College placed HCFA on a year-long “administrative probation” last month. The Crimson reported Feb. 22 that the punishment was most likely due to the religious group’s Sept. 2017 decision to ask a woman in a same-sex relationship to resign from her leadership position.
After administrators announced HCFA’s probation, the finance committee voted down a previous draft of legislation intended to bar the group from UC funding. During that vote, members operated under the assumption that “administrative probation” meant HCFA was automatically prohibited from UC funding.
But at the Wednesday meeting, UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller told him the Office of Student Life has not deemed HCFA ineligible for UC funding.
“What I know is that they have said they’ve created a plan of what needs to change over the coming year,” Boucher said. “I have not seen a plan… but when we asked if that plan included being limited in funding from the UC they said no, that’s not the case.”
The decision to allow HCFA to continue to receive UC funding seems to fit with the OSL’s larger approach to enforcing the group’s probation to date. Christian Union, HCFA’s parent ministry, wrote on its website on March 1 that the Office of Student Life has chosen not to deny HCFA the ability to reserve rooms or recruit students on campus—both key privileges afforded to recognized student organizations on campus.
Miller previously declined to answer a question asking whether HCFA is still allowed to book College rooms while on probation. Last week—post probation—the group hosted its weekly worship session in Yenching Auditorium, a Harvard-owned space.
The OSL website only details what probation means for recognized student groups who specifically fail to complete the annual mandatory renewal of their recognition. For these groups, administrators revoke privileges including the ability to reserve campus spaces and receive funding from the UC and College offices for one semester, according to the website.
Henry S. Atkins ’20, the chair of the finance committee, said Wednesday he had reached out to Miller via email, but had not received a response as of that evening.
Many committee members at the meeting said that they did not believe the Council should be funding HCFA in light of the group’s behavior in Sept. 2017.
“I think that what happened was particularly egregious, I think that it merits this response,” Atkins said.
“I don’t want gay and bisexual people’s money to go to an institution where they are not eligible to be leaders because we need to remember we are giving out students’ term bill money and we’re giving out the money from people that identify with these communities,” Ivy Yard representative Seth Billau ’21 added.
Other representatives—like Dunster House representative Gevin B. Reynolds ’19—said they want to gather more viewpoints and information before moving forward with the funding ban.
“My hesitation with this is we don’t have the same factual documentation that what was alleged in fact happened,” Reynolds said. “If someone from the OSL sat down with us, someone from HCFA sat down with us and said here’s what we did… then I could say, ‘Yes this response is certainly warranted.’”
Council executives previously debated inviting HCFA co-presidents Scott Ely '18 and Molly L. Richmond '18 to speak at a meeting of the full body, but ultimately decided against the invitation after discussions with "administrative advisors."
Much of the debate at Wednesday’s meeting centered on what members called the need to separate the decisions and opinions of HCFA’s leadership from the sentiments of the rest of the membership.
HCFA’s leadership comprises four individuals: two presidents and two vice presidents. Ely and Richmond have repeatedly said student leaders make all policy decisions for the organization.
“If what happened actually happened, it wasn’t because of Christian values, it was because of what one or two people may have done, right, so trying to lump everybody into what had happened I think is really unfortunate and can really hurt a lot of people,” Elm Yard representative Jordan M. Silva ’21 said at the meeting. Silva also said he is a member of HCFA.
The discussion led UC members to add a clarification to the proposed legislation specifically noting that the actions of HCFA’s leadership—rather than HCFA as a whole—violated “values held sacred” by the Council.
The first draft of the legislation specified HCFA would again be able to receive UC funding once the College chose to remove the group from probation and after HCFA demonstrated “contrition.” After debate, though, the finance committee deleted that provision.
Instead, committee members added the clause requiring that the committee must approve of HCFA’s “tangible action to reform” before the group can again receive funding.
Before the committee’s final vote Wednesday, Boucher urged members to seek more information about HCFA, its recent actions, and the College’s decision to punish the group.
“As an individual, I feel like I’ve heard a lot on this,” Boucher said. “I don’t feel like I know everything because to be explicit I have not talked to HCFA in this setting and engaged with them and the conversations that I’ve had with the OSL have been in private advising meetings.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2018 at 1:50 a.m.
Activists, students, and faculty gathered this week at a three-day event to discuss prison education reform at Harvard, demanding the University implement a degree-granting program for incarcerated people and lower barriers to the admission of individuals with criminal records.
A Tuesday panel at the Beyond The Gates conference featured speakers including University professor Danielle S. Allen and Michelle Jones, a graduate student at New York University who garnered national headlines last fall when her application to a Harvard Ph.D. program was rejected. The New York Times reported in Sept. 2017 that administrators rejected Jones in part because of her criminal history, though several faculty members had advocated for her admission.
Some organizers and attendees of the three-day event had three demands for the University: that Harvard implement a degree-granting education program in prisons, offer support for formerly incarcerated students after they are released, and establish a “ban the box” non-discrimination initiative preventing the University from inquiring about applicants’ criminal histories during the hiring and admissions process.
More than two dozen student groups, including the Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, the Undergraduate Council, and the Harvard Black Students Association, co-sponsored the list of demands. Before Tuesday’s panel, students organized a rally in Harvard Yard in support of the conference’s goals for prison education reform.
During the panel, Jones said she thinks the University is losing a valuable perspective when discluding incarcerated individuals.
“Leaving us out with exclusionary practices based on race, sex, class, and criminality, you are lost,” Jones said. “You're missing the beautiful critique. You're missing that extra examination that comes from my experience having been incarcerated.”
“You cannot teach what you do not know. You cannot lead where you do not go,” Jones said repeatedly.
Asked about the three demands and about Jones’s criticism, University spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven pointed to a statement Harvard released at the time news of Jones’ rejection broke.
“The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) is committed to recruiting and enrolling students from groups underrepresented in graduate study and strives to create an inclusive and supportive environment where all students can thrive and grow academically and personally,” the statement said.
Jones emphasized Tuesday that incarcerated individuals are capable of attending academic institutions like Harvard, but have historically been denied access.
“There are thousands of incarcerated people who've been lucky enough to have access to a higher education that allowed them to display what they already had within them,” Jones said. “I think we need to remember that because we are people who happened to be incarcerated as opposed to some monster that has been transformed by the magic of education.”
Evan C. MacKay ’19, student director of Harvard Organization for Prison Education and Reform, said he thinks Harvard should implement a “mixed classroom model” that would take students from campus to prison to learn alongside incarcerated students.
Harvard used to have such a program. From 2008 to 2013, the Prisons Studies Project sent Harvard students to take classes at Norfolk Prison in Norfolk, Mass. in conjunction with incarcerated individuals. The program later ceased due to a lack of funding.
Two members of Liberation Literacy, a group in Portland, Ore. dedicated to educating incarcerated individuals, also attended the panel. One member, Paul Henry Grice III, said the program transformed his life trajectory.
“I had a chance to expand my mind and get challenged. And that's the biggest accomplishment that you can do while being incarcerated, is challenge somebody to be better than what they are,” Grice said. “I don't know if you understand that you are a number inside. My name was not Paul Henry Grice III, and I say it all the time, let me say my full name, because for four and a half years I was 15980751.”
The Undergraduate Council endorsed the conference’s demands in a vote Sunday.
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, a UC representative for Leverett House, said she believes the “ban the box” initiative would lead to a more diverse student body.
“That is a step forward in making sure that Harvard doesn't further incarcerate formerly incarcerated people by barring them from entering institutions that they're qualified to enter simply because of a criminal history or criminal record,” Abdelrahman said.
Harvard asks applicants to its undergraduate program to disclose any criminal or discipline history on the Common Application, which most students use to apply to the College. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences application, however, does not inquire about applicants’ criminal histories.
The GSAS admissions office describes how it takes into account applicants backgrounds—presumably including their criminal histories—in a statement on the FAQ section of its website.
“Program admissions committees review all applicants in a comprehensive way, considering their past educational attainments and the contributions they can make to the academic community and to their field of study. Applicants will not be denied admission based on their disclosure of conviction and should not be discouraged from applying,” the statement reads.
Nicholas T. Wyville ’20, a UC representative for Eliot House, pointed out that some of Harvard’s peer institutions—including NYU—offer degree-granting programs to prisoners. Last August, Louisiana became the first state to bar public colleges and universities from inquiring about applicants’ criminal histories.
“Harvard is not trying to do something radical, but instead we're just trying to get on the same page as everyone else,” Wyville said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 9, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Yale and Columbia offer degree-granting programs to prisoners. In fact, Yale does not offer such a program; and Columbia offers a program that gives prisoners credit they can use toward obtaining a degree at peer institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Xiao-Li Meng will step down at the end of June and current interim Dean Emma Dench will take over the position July 1, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced Thursday.
Over the past year, Meng—a statistician by training—has been on sabbatical to pursue research on “foundational issues” in new data science fields, with Dench assuming his duties as interim dean.
Meng has held the GSAS deanship since 2012. During his five years in the position, he helped create the Harvard Horizons, a program which offers eight Ph.D. students the chance to receive mentorship from professionals and present their research at an annual symposium. He also helped found the GSAS Center for Writing and Communicating Ideas, which provides graduate students discipline-specific support for academic papers, dissertations, and presentations.
Meng’s tenure saw the formation of the Harvard Data Science Initiative, a University-wide program launched last fall that aims to elevate Harvard to the forefront of the field.
After his resignation, Meng plans to take on a new leadership role in the Data Science Initiative, Smith wrote. He will also serve as editor-in-chief of a new data science journal debuting next academic year and will assume the presidency of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, an international society of statisticians.
“I am grateful to Dean Meng for his willingness to lend his leadership and internationally recognized expertise to this important academic priority,” Smith wrote.
Dench, who has concurrent appointments with the History and Classics departments, previously worked as the graduate studies director for the Classics department before becoming interim dean.
“Dean Dench has demonstrated a deep and nuanced understanding of the needs of graduate students and a sincere commitment to supporting them in their academic journey,” Smith wrote. “She has won the respect of her faculty colleagues for her thoughtful outreach and of GSAS staff for her steady guidance and her ability to forge creative and practical solutions to meet the needs of students.”
Dench’s transition comes at a critical time for GSAS and its students. On April 18 and 19, eligible graduate and undergraduate students will vote on whether to form a union, thus earning the right to collectively bargain with the University. Like many other schools, GSAS is also grappling with the University’s subpar endowment returns and an uncertain political climate for international students.
Smith wrote that he asked Meng to partner with Dench to “build philanthropic support for graduate education” going forward.
“Our students and programs are fortunate to have two such able advocates for their important work,” Smith wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball will head to Philadelphia this weekend, with hopes of winning the second annual Ivy League Tournament, and punching its ticket to March Madness.
The Crimson (18-9, 10-4 Ivy) face the unenviable task of taking on hosts Pennsylvania on Saturday night, needing a win to advance to Sunday’s final. Despite Harvard’s overall youth, the team has experience at the Ancient Eight tournament, losing to Princeton in the first round of last year’s inaugural event.
“Knowing what to expect, knowing what the atmosphere is going to be like, is definitely going to be helpful,” sophomore guard Katie Benzan said. “Having that experience, and that first year under our belt is going to definitely make us more comfortable.”
Although the Crimson has not advanced to the NCAA tournament since 2007, this season marks the 20-year anniversary of No. 16 Harvard’s shocker of top-seeded Stanford, the only time an upset of that level has been accomplished in the men’s or women’s national tournament.
In order for the Crimson to win the divisional tournament and represent the Ivy League on the national stage, it must win two consecutive games away from the friendly confines of Cambridge.
“I’m glad we were there last year, and we know what it’s about,” said coach Kathy Delaney-Smith of the tournament.
The Quakers (20-7, 11-3) enter the weekend as the second seed, and will prove to be a stiff test for the third-seeded Crimson. Worse for the visitors is the fact that game will be played at the Palestra, a home court at which Penn tallied a 9-2 record on this season, including a 69-49 win over Harvard in early February.
“Last time we were at the Palestra, we just weren’t ourselves,” Benzan said. “This coming weekend we have a chance for redemption, and a chance to show that this tournament might be at their home court, but we can win this game.”
The Crimson split the two contests against the defending conference champions this season, with Harvard’s 55-52 win over Penn two weeks ago representing its first win over its Philadelphia-residing foes in five seasons.
“We haven’t played well against them for a number of years, given their height, given their system,” Delaney-Smith said. “It does feel like we’ve figured it out, it does feel as if the monkey is off of our back.”
Harvard, which entered last weekend with just one road win in Ancient Eight play, was able to complete a road sweep of Cornell and Columbia, despite a snow storm that delayed both games by a day.
“This past weekend was so weird and unusual because of the snow, and playing on Sunday,” Benzan said. “We just had to focus on what we were doing in the moment.”
The Crimson is eyeing the wins this weekend by an impressive combined 53 points as indicative of a change in seasons and results on the road.
“I was impressed by our maturity that’s really started to come out,” Delaney-Smith said. “The New York road trip to Cornell and Columbia is never easy.”
Crucial to Harvard’s chances will be limiting the play of senior center Michelle Nwokedi, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year. Nwokedi scored a season-high 30 points in Penn’s home romp over the Crimson, but was held to a mere six points on 3-13 shooting in the matchup at Lavietes Pavilion.
For Harvard to shut down Nwokedi, the interior presence of sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm and freshman forward Jadyn Bush will be essential. In last season’s Ivy League tournament loss to the Tigers, Boehm struggled from the field, shooting 3-11 and finishing with just seven points.
More importantly, Boehm and Bush will have to step up defensively to stop Nwokedi and center Eleah Parker. Boehm starred in the Crimson’s win over Penn in February, tallying nine rebounds and a season-high five blocks. The Winnetka, Ill., native’s defensive ferocity must once again be present if Harvard hopes to pull of the road upset.
Bush’s recent performances have offered reason to suspect that the rookie could break out in Philadelphia. In the Sunday’s road win over Columbia, she registered a career-high 21 points on an impressive 80 percent shooting from the field.
“My team is young still,” Delaney-Smith said. “There’s a maturity that has started to come, learning about ourselves, understanding that our challenges don’t have to let us lose.”
Another key element for Delaney-Smith’s team will be the performance of Benzan, whose steady play has been paramount to the team’s success. The Wellesley Mass., native struggled as a freshman at the tournament last season, scoring just eight points on 3-11 shooting.
“It’s a big stage, and I was so pumped up, my adrenaline was so high, I was playing too fast,” Benzan said. “We just have to remember that it’s a 40-minute game.”
Benzan has performed exceptionally well in conference play this season, shooting at exactly 50 percent from three-point territory, while recording over 14 points per game and knocking down 88 percent of her free throw opportunities.
The perimeter play of Benzan and junior guard and co-captain Madeline Raster will be crucial, especially considering the strong play of Quakers’ guard Anna Ross, who doggedly defended Benzan in both meetings this season. Ross helped hold Benzan to one of nine in shooting and one of seven from beyond the arc in the Crimson’s 55-52 home win.
Ultimately, Harvard’s chances will come down to whether or not the team can replicate its aggressive play from the past two weeks against the defending Ancient Eight champions on their home court.
With tough interior defense and sturdy outside shooting, Benzan and the rest of the team will have a chance to pull of the upset and advance to Sunday’s final, looking to book a ticket to its first Big Dance in 11 seasons.
“I don’t really care how many points or assists, or three-pointers I have,” Benzan said. “As long as the Harvard score is more than the Penn score, I’ll be happy. I just want to do everything in my power to make that happen.”
