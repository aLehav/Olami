After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — On a recent Friday night, I saw Harvard Yard in a way I hadn’t seen it since my freshman year. There were no harried, sleep-deprived students hustling to class; no stumbling revelers on their way to the River, braving the New England winter in hopes of forgetting a week’s worth of stress. There were only dimly-lit walkways surrounded by trees and history, a picturesque tableau that someone with an engaging and fulfilling college career ahead of them would find easy to imagine. Of course, I’m going to be a senior in a little over a month, and the promise that the Yard held for me three years ago was dampened that Friday night by the prospect of having just one year left to make up for lost time before being exiled into the barren wasteland that the “real world” has become. Feeling old and washed up, I needed a cure for my little quarter-life crisis. The only thing I could think of: watching a couple of guys in their 60’s rock out on the piano as if it was still 1975 and they had just blown a few lines in the dressing room. Luckily, my best friend Danny and I had tickets to see Billy Joel and Elton John play at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass. the following night. I have to admit, at first the scene at Gillette didn’t provide much more than further proof that a Constitutional ban on white people dancing might be enough to end the recession. It was still light out when we arrived, and while the two performers started the show combining on classics like John’s “Your Song” and Joel’s “My Life,” the crowd—mostly aged middle and beyond—seemed more concerned with finding the bathroom than listening to a pair of Rock and Roll Hall of Famers. As for the Hall of Famers themselves, they were belting out tunes with the enthusiasm of the house band at the resort in the Catskills my grandparents took me to when I was a little kid. I began to vaguely wish that instead of sharing my musical taste with my mom, I knew who MGMT was or gave a crap about Ratatat, like a lot of my much cooler friends. But as darkness began to envelop the stadium, the crowd's collective restless bladder suddenly became more manageable and the old men on stage suddenly remembered who they were, or at least who they once were. Soon Joel left the stage and John launched his audience through a frenzied stretch of songs in which he became Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis and his younger self all at the same time, fingers blazing across the piano in electrifying performances of “Saturday” and “Crocodile Rock.” Defiantly and accurately proclaiming, “I'm still standing," John strutted around the stage like a fabulous hobbit, decked out in a black coat emblazoned with the sparkling image of a yellow brick road on the back. Through a thrilling display of rock and roll at its finest, climaxing with a thunderous rendition of "Rocket Man," Sir Elton showed why he is music royalty. Joel had a tough act to follow in his solo portion of the set, and he rose to the occasion. While his pianist and showman skills can’t rival John’s, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better opening number than "Angry Young Man," in which Joel exploded through the pitch black in a burst of light and fury, maniacally pounding the keys as he announced his arrival. But flashiness isn’t Joel’s game. Unlike the aristocratic Elton, whose immense individual skill outshines everything else in the stadium, Billy’s at his most entertaining when he’s featuring those around him. That Saturday, he left most of the face-melting solos to his talented band and made sure to get the crowd involved, rambling between songs like someone’s drunk uncle at Thanksgiving dinner. It’s easy to take Joel lightly, especially when he’s attacking bugs with a giant yellow fly swatter, putting on an awful mock-New England accent, and commiserating with the people in the nosebleeds (“You probably paid way too much for those shitty seats”). But as Danny pointed out, Billy’s laid-back attitude is carefully constructed, just like his songs. In numbers like the epic “Scenes from an Italian Restaurant” and the working-class anthem “Allentown,” Joel made clear why he’s lasted so long: He’s an incredibly gifted storyteller with a knack for playing a diverse range of music that has appeal across generations. Eventually, John returned to the stage and the duo wrapped up the concert in style, finishing with two of Elton’s songs before playing (what else?) Joel’s “Piano Man” for the encore. I’d like to say that I left Gillette Stadium that night with a new sense of clarity about my uncertain future, but I didn’t. In the end, it was just a concert. But after seeing two sexagenarians—both of whom have hit rock bottom enough times for multiple lifetimes—prancing around the stage like the glory days never ended, I think I’ll be able to view my next trip to Harvard Yard with a little less melodrama, and a little more perspective.

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif.—This summer I'm interning at the San Francisco offices of a Chinese solar panel company, which by some measures is the biggest manufacturer of solar photovoltaic panels in the world. For a couple years I have avidly followed the course of climate legislation in the United States as well as in the international community, but getting to watch that debate unfold from within the "green economy" bubble has been an eye-opening experience, made all the more interesting by the fact that my employer is Chinese. In brief, the last couple of months have left me with the strong impression that unless America begins making massive investments in renewable energy and pledges sharp cuts in emissions, we are effectively dropping out of the race to become the world's leading provider of these technologies.
Whatever your thoughts on the causes of climate change, the irreducible fact is that enough people around the world are sold on the threat of global warming, as well the long term problems from the air pollution, dwindling supply and ever-increasing costs of fossil fuels, that trillions of dollars are going to be spent over the course of the next century on renewable energy technologies. No country, nor even any American state, can expect to stake a leading position in this emerging industry unless there is a strong base of domestic consumption underpinning the industry. One person who seems to have gotten the message Governor Rick Perry seems to have gotten that message, along with his Republican cohorts in Texas, some of whom remain unconvinced that global warming is even a man-made threat to the planet but are nonetheless aggressively seeking to attract high-tech renewable energy companies. Not surprisingly, Texas has long since surpassed California in installed wind capacity.
The U.S. currently trails Japan, Europe, and China in the  number of top renewable energy companies. America currently ranks third behind Germany and Japan in installed solar capacity, and is first by a slim margin in installed wind capacity, ahead of Germany, a country  with less than a third of our population. The American Clean Energy and Security act (ACES), the federal climate and energy legislation under consideration this summer, which has cleared the House, but is likely to be watered down, if it ever passes the Senate, would aim for between 12 and 15 percent renewable energy by 2020. If other countries follow through with already-existing commitments, in 2020 we'll be well behind all of Europe, Japan, and China in installed renewable energy (as a percentage of our total energy demand). The company I'm working for, like many solar photovoltaic companies, has relied on sales in Germany and, until the market collapsed, Spain. It is thought that the Chinese market for photovoltaic  panels could grow tenfold by 2020. 
In the debate over ACES,  the Republicans and coal-state Democrats opposing or at least seeking to neuter the legislation repeatedly speak about the competitive disadvantage America will suffer if it takes the lead in fossil fuel regulation, particularly in relation to a still developing country but major rival such as China. Yet China, for all its unwillingness to commit to carbon caps, stands poised to seriously outpace us in the global renewable energy market. The Chinese are actively pursuing a beefed up version of what Republicans like to call an all-of-the-above energy policy. Yes, plenty of coal-fired power plants, but also generous emphasis on wind, solar, and nuclear. It appears as though China will have little difficulty surpassing its 15 percent renewable energy target by 2020, and will end up closer to 18 percent—between three and six percent more than the U.S. To give just one example, the so-called "Three Gorges of Wind" project—named after the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest—aims to produce 20 gigawatts of electricity by 2020, and is merely one of six similarly-sized projects currently in development. To give you a sense of how big that is, the entire U.S. today has 29 gigawatts of installed wind power. Oil-tycoon-cum-wind-power-magnate T. Boone Pickens’ roadmap for energy independence, the "Pickens' Plan,"which got so much press last summer, involves only four gigawatts of wind.   
Servicing a billion-plus person domestic market, the Chinese energy industry looks to a future of being both the world’s biggest polluter and source of carbon emissions, as well as the globe’s largest and most mature market for renewable energy. As a result, China could come to dominate the international market for renewables. America, which only very recently ceded the title of “top carbon-emitter” to China after a century of unchallenged dominance, and is still living down the Bush administration’s rejection of the Kyoto treaty, seems poised to position itself as an also-ran in perhaps the most critical industry for the future world economy, despite the best efforts of the Obama administration, It is troglodytes in Congress who are putting America at a “competitive disadvantage” vis a vis China.

MANCHESTER, Conn. — Next year, Senator Chris Dodd may shave his pompadour. Last week, Quinnipiac University released a poll in which half of Connecticut’s voters disfavored the Democrat. Buoyed by this billow, three Republicans—Rob Simmons, Sam Caligiuri, and Tom Foley—are vying for their party’s nomination to dislodge Dodd. To increase chances of victory, some Republicans want to pick a candidate speedily. But they should choose carefully, because voters won’t trade Tweedledum for Tweedledee.
Why did Dodd’s political health deteriorate? He caught Connecticutitis. When you spend 27 years in the Senate, presidential ambitions cloud your mind. You move to Iowa and win zero delegates in the primary. Then, you get sloppy. You wait 193 days to disclose documents about your cheap mortgage from Countrywide Financial, which you oversee on the Banking Committee. And you scold American International Group, a donor to your campaign, for paying bonuses with taxpayers’ money, before admitting that you loosened the loophole.
Unfortunately, Connecticutitis is contagious. Just ask Senator Joe Lieberman. Republicans must select a candidate who, through personality and policy, shows immunity to corruption.
Simmons, a former Congressman, casts himself as the go-getter. With 22 years of legislative experience, Simmons says he will be effective “from day one.” He is prepared: From 1981 to 1985, he was staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I briefed Mitch McConnell when he first came to the Senate. The Senate is not a new institution to me,” Simmons said. But this experience may be a liability if voters want change. Still, Simmons argued, “Do you want someone in Washington D.C. who knows what he’s doing?”
Caligiuri, a state senator, and Foley, the former ambassador to Ireland, call themselves outsiders. “I’m not a career politician,” Foley said, before touting 25 years of corporate experience. Meanwhile, Caligiuri cited his pledge to serve only two terms, unlike Dodd: “Dodd’s interest is in perpetuating his existence.” But why take a newbie instead of an old pro? Dodd, for example, is leading the debate over health care. “The fact that he’s in front of every issue imaginable is a cynical ploy to show people he’s interested in doing his job again,” Caligiuri replied.
On most issues, the candidates sing in harmony: They all oppose President Barack Obama’s plans to reform health care and stop global warming. But listen closely, and you’ll hear subtle differences. For instance, Caligiuri wanted “strong financial incentives” to curb emissions, while Foley acknowledged, “I think the cap and trade system should be a small part of the solution.” 
Some Republicans think that Simmons is the strongest candidate because he has the most name recognition and money. But message is more important, and Republicans should let the candidates distinguish themselves before making a pick. There may be a few surprises. Foley raised over $500,000 in June, almost beating Simmons. And Caligiuri, whose name Senator John Cornyn botched on national television in April, told me, “Senator Cornyn couldn’t pronounce my name six weeks ago, but he can now.”
In the Senate, Simmons, Caligiuri, or Foley would outshine Dodd. Still, the incumbent will be tough to beat. Already, his approval ratings are recovering. Republicans should wait until each candidate’s message is better defined; then, they should decide. Otherwise, voters may stick with Dodd. The people of Connecticut are notoriously stubborn—they call their state, “The Land of Steady Habits.” I hope that isn’t their way of saying they make the same mistakes twice.

NEW YORK, N.Y.—Last week, as Bronx native Sonia Sotomayor testified before the Senate and President Barack H. Obama visited New York to commemorate the centennial of the NAACP, I sat on the Lower East Side, a neighborhood that has been home to immigrants for generations. I work at Henry Street Settlement, founded by Lillian Wald, an early supporter of the NAACP. She hosted the informal reception that kicked off the 1909 National Negro Conference that helped launch the century-old organization. In a stuffy office across from housing projects, I read drafts of college essays written by New York high school students, including many by poor immigrants. I remembered Sotomayor’s controversial statement—“a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experience would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life”—and wondered: What creates wisdom?
My own personal statement demonstrated a commitment to an extracurricular activity, and ended on a cheery note about personal growth. The students I work with at Henry Street have many ideas about what makes a college essay, and they are usually less comfortable. One of them, P, who came here with his brothers from Panama just two years ago, wrote about his parents’ divorce and his abandonment by his mother. P and many of his peers have never written about their tumultuous personal lives before. Their essays serve many functions that mine didn’t: venting, confiding, and forgiving.
P’s emotional depth does not get in the way of his writing style. His recently acquired English is textured like Nabokov’s, and he likes to prick the imagination with unexpected words and fantastic metaphors.  His transition from Spanish to English has improbably recreated the early twentieth-century’s revolution in consciousness—he writes unpunctuated streams to rival James Joyce. When I teach him grammar, I provide dashes and colons to preserve his extraordinary phrasing.
Though he is only 17, P possesses uncommon ambition and resilience. He has come by my door, smiling, every day for the past two weeks—but his SAT scores are low enough that many colleges will not even bother to consider his vivacious essays. Fortunately, P lives here in New York City, so he has two attractive options. The City University of New York runs a strong and vast network of community and four-year colleges, which cost in-state families less than $5,000 a year. And if P’s academic performance and income fall within state standards, he may qualify for financial aid and support services from the State University of New York’s Educational Opportunity Program or its siblings at CUNY and New York’s private colleges. These programs ask students like P to write about the hardships they have endured. Their difficult experiences become their qualifications for acceptance. The implication is that these resilient students, perhaps like Judge Sotomayor, have something important to share—because of race, poverty, and even plain adversity. I wonder: How can one compare the wisdom granted by different kinds of hardships? I also wonder about the opportunities available to poor high school students who live outside of New York City. Do they have the chance to attend affordable colleges, and write about their inner selves? 
I imagine that if his teachers had encouraged him to write about his painful private life, P would now be even more at home in his lucid streams of consciousness.

SANTIAGO, Chile — Hoping to get out of the sprinkling rain and into our warm beds (well, at least as warm as possible in a country where few homes have central heating), two friends and I hailed a cab to take us home from the restaurant where we had been celebrating a birthday.   
One of them pulled open the door, and the three of us hopped into the cab. As I waited for my turn to say, “Francisco de Aguirre y Luis Carrera, cerca del Club de Polo”—the directions to my host family’s house that I have given dozens of times since my arrival in Santiago—I started to notice that my surroundings were a little…unusual.
All the seats, the ceiling, the dashboard, the steering wheel, even the doors were completely covered in fabric—cow fabric. Everywhere I looked, white cloth with black spots. Oh my.
It was clear that I was not the only one blown away by the fact that we were in a “Cow Cab.” My friends were equally astonished by our surreal surroundings and we laughed harder and harder as we noticed the cow stuffed animals lining the dashboard and the blue light on the ceiling that made the cow fabric glow. 
Then it happened. “MOOOOOOO!”  The taxi mooed.  
We lost it.  
“Do you like cows?” my fellow passenger asked the driver, his words broken up by laughter. According to the cabbie, it was not so much a penchant for the four-legged animal that drove him to convert his taxi into a bovine on wheels, but a yearning for his rural hometown and life away from the bustling streets of Santiago. Supposedly having a cow taxi reminds him of the countryside.  
Reflecting on the experience over Gchat the next morning, my friend and I talked about how the TaxiVaca (or “Cow Cab”) reminded us of the popular Discovery Channel show “Cash Cab.” I laughed at her suggestion that the TaxiVaca should require passengers to moo the answers to trivia questions in Spanish. We would have lost horribly. 
The last of the three to get dropped off that evening, I paid the driver and stepped out onto my driveway. I had barely closed the door when the nighttime quiet of my residential street was pierced by a final “MOOOOO!” as the Cow Cab bid me adieu.  
If I had to choose, I might take the TaxiVaca over winning $500 on the streets of Manhattan.

LOS ANGELES, Calif. – I grew up in Los Angeles, and I can't drive. I never thought that not having this semi-basic skill would be a very big deal, but it is becoming increasingly embarrassing. It's not that I'm averse to cars. I just never got around to enlisting in driving school after I left home for college, and before then, it was simply out of the question.
Late one night during the summer before my senior year of high school, I was sitting in the passenger seat when my friend Christine made a left turn and collided with a SUV. Our significantly smaller car skidded several yards and was totaled upon impact. An airbag erupted in my face and violently threw me against my seat. It smelled like someone had tried to make cupcakes out of plastic and failed.  For a split second, I actually believed the car would explode and, had I not been in such a hurry to get out, my shell-shocked friend might've actually remained inside the vehicle for the rest of the evening. (A paramedic later informed me that explosions only happen in movies.) Against all odds, we only suffered a few cuts. My bruises were mostly from the airbag, which left a purplish ripple down the side of my face.
I was shaken, but not traumatized. To my mother, on the other hand, I might as well have been hooked up to tubes and on the brink of death. I was forbidden from riding in cars with friends. As for my own license? If even Christine, my "responsible" friend, managed to get us into an accident, then I shouldn't ever be allowed behind the wheel. Since I was in no position to pay for my own car or insurance, I didn't argue.
And so it was for many years. At some point, I could have reopened the topic for discussion, but after I went to college, learning how to drive seemed so irrelevant when I spent most of the year within the same half-mile radius. Besides, being immobile in Los Angeles didn't bother me. I was used to it. I'm one of the few people over 14 and under 65 who's actually set foot on the "subway," a Metro-run underground train that is approximately one-twentieth the length of any other metropolitan rail system in America. Starting at age 16, I worked three summers in L.A. without a license, which meant daily hour-and-a-half-long commutes (and that's just one-way). On subsequent visits home, having to beg for a car ride from a friend never seemed as bad as those mind-numbing hours on public transportation.
But now, my inability to drive has become somewhat embarrassing and extremely inconvenient. When I want to visit my grandfather, who lives in a nursing facility two miles from my house, I have to jog there after sundown because it's too hot to wait for a bus during the day. My mother regularly drops me off at lunch with my friends; she's even offered to drive me to bars before. At the end of a night out, my pals jokingly yell "Not it!" when it comes time to decide who drives me home. Once, a kind girlfriend drove me to the other side of the county so that I could attend a meeting with a literary agent, while she waited downstairs at a Coffee Bean. As much as I wanted to pretend that it was sort of like being an executive with a car service, it really wasn't.
Last week, my mother chauffeured me to a meeting with my thesis adviser. That was the final straw. While I attempted to engage in a discussion about conservative social movements, she waited for me outside, parked under the shade and ready to emerge at a phone call's notice. Next month, it's my 22nd birthday. I envision turning 28, with my mother ready to drive me to work, and determine that I'd rather risk another encounter with an airbag.
My adviser, surprisingly, could empathize. Born and raised in England, the Cambridge graduate never learned how to operate a vehicle until he decided to relocate to Los Angeles. He enlisted in the Brookline Driving School beforehand and received his license in a matter of weeks. He assured me it was easy to get the hang of it.
"But what if I pass the test in Massachusetts and can't drive on the freeway in L.A.?"
"Don't worry," he said. "When I came out here, I just practiced with my mother."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The trial of a Boston University graduate student accused of illegal music downloading is slated to begin today, as his legal team, headed by Harvard Law School cyberlaw professor Charles R. Nesson, seeks to set a legal precedent that would protect digital file sharers from prosecution and avoid as much as $4.5 million in damages.
It will be only the second case to see trial under the landmark Digital Theft Deterrence Act—which imposes up to $150,000 in penalties for each instance of willful copyright infringement. Approximately 30,000 people have settled fines averaging $3,000 to $12,000 out of court since the law's passage in 1999. The first case tried in court ended in a mistrial.
As a result, 25-year-old Joel Tenenbaum's fight against the music industry has the potential to set a precedent for the treatment of future cases of illegal file-sharing pursued by the Recording Industry Association of America, an association that led the industry's legal and lobbying battles against online file-sharing.
Nesson, who co-founded the Berkman Center for Internet and Society in 1996, is expected to defend his client by challenging the constitutionality of the damages Tenenbaum faces. Nesson has argued that the RIAA and the plaintiffs—which include Sony and Warner Brothers—are "seeking to punish him beyond any rational measure of the damage he allegedly caused," and such a punishment would violate the 5th and 8th Amendments.
Tenenbaum was initially accused of illegally sharing seven songs, a tally later increased to 30 songs. The RIAA estimates that illegal music-sharing worldwide costs $12.5 billion each year and causes 71,000 job losses in the United States.
A well-known proponent for freedom of Internet use, Nesson wrote that he does not dispute the need for copyright laws. Instead, he wrote, existing copyright laws should be modified to reflect the evolving social norms of a digital, interconnected world.
As such, Nesson plans to argue that Tenenbaum's actions constituted "fair use" of the copyrighted songs he allegedly downloaded. Fair use is determined by four factors—the purpose of one's use, the type of work under copyright protection, the amount and importance of the portion used, and the effect of the use on the market.
If Nesson's strategy succeeds, the case could set a precedent that legalizes all non-commercial file-sharing, on the grounds that such behavior in a digital society does not violate existing copyright laws.
Not all cyberlaw professors at Harvard agree with Nesson's unorthodox approach. In an emailed exchange, Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, who argued against copyright extensions before the Supreme Court, wrote that Nesson did "the law too much kindness by trying to pretend (or stretch) 'fair use' excuses what [Tenenbaum] did."
But Nesson is no stranger to controversy, most recently defending two men accused of smoking marijuana by calling for jury nullification--for the jury to return a vote of "not guilty" despite acknowledging a violation of the law. (Lessig wrote in an email that jury nullification would be "the only honest frame for Joel's case.")
The trial will take place at the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under Judge Nancy Gertner. It is expected to be completed by the end of this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale's School of Medicine has recruited its second major Harvard faculty member this year as part of an aggressive three-pronged expansion into clinical neuroscience, cancer, and cardiovascular disease research—initiatives sustained despite ongoing financial duress.
David A. Hafler, a world-renowned multiple sclerosis researcher and the director of molecular immunology in the Department of Neurology at Harvard Medical School, will leave Boston in September to chair Yale's Department of Neurology. Hafler said that he was very happy with his position at Harvard, but ultimately the opportunity to organize and run an entire department at Yale prompted him to accept the offer.
"[Yale] is very much still in expansion mode," Hafler said. "In spite of the downturn, Yale is going ahead with number of major recruits and and expanding number of programs." He added that though Harvard is "clearly not in expansion mode right now," the University already benefits from a "credible strength across the board" and what many regard as "the best medical complex on earth."
In April, Thomas J. Lynch, Jr., former chief of hematology and oncology at the Mass. General Cancer Center, left Harvard after 23 years to become director of the Yale Cancer Center and physician-in-chief of the Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Yale had also appointed a new chief of cardiology from Dartmouth last summer.
Robert J. Alpern, dean of the Yale School of Medicine, said in an interview that he was willing to "invest heavily" in building his neurology department despite the school's slumping endowment. He said that Harvard, with a larger endowment but similar financial difficulties, may be focusing on other priorities.
"I want [Hafler] to be able to build a great program, I want him to recruit a lot of faculty, and I want our neurology program to get much bigger than it is now," Alpern said. "I actually want someone with his great taste to come here and recruit a lot of clinical and research faculty, and so we put up a package that would allow him to do both."
Hafler joined the Harvard faculty in 1984 and led a team that identified the genes implicated in causing multiple sclerosis, which he said is likely his "most important and long-lasting" accomplishment. But Alpern said that what makes Hafler exceptional among researchers world-wide are his leadership skills and ability to translate research work to the clinical domain.
"Every department needs leadership if the department is going to go from outstanding to more outstanding," said Stephen Waxman, Yale's current neurology chair, who also praised Hafler's work in organizing international research consortia. "Among people who are really good scientists, very few have the innate ability to build programs and collaborations and cooperative efforts, and he has that ability."
Hafler, who will also become chief of neurology at Yale-New Haven Hospital, said that in building and organizing a new and larger clinical department for Yale, he would likely be hiring many new faculty and researchers—possibly from Harvard. He said that Yale is offering attractive positions for new researchers, and that he certainly hoped he would be able to move his entire lab, which according to its Web site includes two assistant professors, four junior faculty instructors, and almost 10 post-doctoral fellows.
Kevin C. O'Connor, an assistant professor of neurology who has worked with Hafler for over 10 years, said that Hafler has expressed interest in taking his senior staff with him to Yale, but that nothing has been finalized.
Alpern said that while Yale does not specifically target Harvard in searching for new faculty, many top quality medical researchers happen to be in Boston. Most of them, he said, are not interested in leaving Harvard unless Yale is offering an attractive position in an high-priority, visionary program.
Nancy Tarbell, HMS's dean of academic and clinical affairs, said she was not concerned about the recent departures marking a trend, as she viewed Yale's successful recruitment efforts as more of a testimony than a threat to Harvard's ability to train leading researchers. That peer institutions have set their sights on Harvard faculty and offered them leadership positions should be viewed as "a positive," Tarbell said.
"We're really helping to influence the leadership around the country," Tarbell said. "But of course, retaining some of our best and brightest is always something we care about."
Even before Harvard felt the full effects of the financial crisis, the Medical School had been working to revamp faculty development and diversity efforts. These initiatives, Tarbell said, had been identified as one of the many priorities spawning from Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier's strategic planning process launched in Oct. 2007, soon after Flier assumed his post.
But once Harvard found itself in financial straits, the Medical School had to rein in its efforts and focus instead on "things that are not very expensive but improve faculty morale," Tarbell said. Tarbell declined to discuss details, as the initiatives have yet to be officially announced.
Like Harvard's other schools, the Medical School was forced to limit its faculty searches to "very selective ones [that] made sense going forward" in the past year, Tarbell said.
"We followed up a little more slowly given the financial constraints," Tarbell said of faculty development efforts. "We're trying to be realistic and not do things we can't afford to do."
Alpern said that Hafler's decision to leave for Yale would likely not hurt Harvard's neurology program significantly, given its depth of researchers, but noted that the appointment would be a "major improvement" for Yale's department. He also said that Harvard and Yale have traditionally collaborated in research, despite their friendly competition, and that Harvard faculty had helped Yale build its cancer center.
"Harvard is very strong in neurology and has a lot of depth. [Halper's departure] is no doubt a loss, but it's not a catastrophic loss," Alpern said. "We very much want to grow our clinical practice, and Harvard already has a much larger clinical practice in neurology than we do, so this will be an opportunity for us to really expand on that."
