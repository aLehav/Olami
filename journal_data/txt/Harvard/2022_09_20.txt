In the world of fine dining, established restaurants and chefs set the standards for trends in global food culture. The early 20th century introduced the food world to the gastronomic innovation of Lyon, where the legendary Eugénie Brazier opened La Mère Brazier, her flagship restaurant. Brazier’s light yet classical French dishes became the epitome of gastronomy and the beginning of nouvelle cuisine.
Later, other icons emerged from under Brazier’s wing, including the famed Paul Bocuse. With respect to a long culinary tradition and history, Bocuse refined and cultivated older recipes to maximize their potential, positioning him as a leading figure in nouvelle cuisine. Following in Bocuse’s footsteps, restaurants around the world continued to contribute to the evolution of food culture, most famously with the Adrià brothers at the impeccably avant-garde El Bulli, launching gastronomy into the future by being persistently innovative and unique at all costs.
In more recent years, fine dining establishments have taken a less uniform approach to gastronomy and innovation. Modena-based Massimo Bottura focuses on the revitalization and reinterpretation of tradition and terroir in his renowned restaurant, Osteria Francescana. On the other side of the world, Mashama Bailey’s The Grey, in Savannah, Georgia, examines the history of the American South, both in cuisine and culture. In Chicago, Alinea, led by Grant Achatz, follows in El Bulli’s footsteps by relentlessly pushing molecular gastronomy to a somehow even more molecular level –– think floating balloons made of sugar, fruit, and helium, among many other inventions.
Clearly, these chefs have brilliantly mastered their crafts and philosophies, paving their own paths in the global food culture. Yet, with so much variation, it is hard to say what this generation’s defining movement will be in the evolution of cuisine.
Recently, veganism has attempted various coups d’états in haute cuisine establishments across the globe. In 2021, Daniel Humm’s Eleven Madison Park made its pivotal switch to a plant-based menu. Generally, Humm’s transition to veganism received poor reviews in its early stages, most notably with a devastating account in the New York Times by Pete Wells. While Humm is, without a doubt, an extremely talented chef, his vegan dishes remained in their infancy a bit too long after the switch was implemented. Despite an initial setback, Eleven Madison Park gradually regained its prestige.
While most restaurants have not eliminated the use of all animal products, the emphasis on vegetarian and pescatarian offerings has undeniably gained more attention and thought. In 2001, Alain Passard announced that his Parisian restaurant, L’Arpège, a famously meat-focused establishment, would convert to a vegetarian menu. While Passard eventually reintroduced some meat and fish to his menu, L’Arpège remains mostly vegetable-focused, prioritizing the utmost respect and reverence for each ingredient.
Likewise, in San Francisco, Dominique Crenn removed meat from her menus, leaving diners with a delightfully pure and subtle pescatarian experience. While Passard limited meat to give vegetables the spotlight they’ve historically been refused, Crenn announced that the decision was made primarily for environmental reasons.
Passard and Crenn, among many others, have pioneered the movement of restricting meat-centered experiences from fine dining and placed their emphasis on often underappreciated ingredients in the world of haute cuisine. This subtle transition of global food culture from meat to vegetables has not cut out all animal products from menus, but only refocused the lens.
Veganism, or at least vegetable-centered food, seems to be a promising step forward in the future of fine dining. But, it is imperative to remember that plant-focused dining experiences will only succeed should each dish be made for the ingredient: A dish that would have originally relied on meat should not count on vegetables as a worthy substitute. Dishes have to be constructed for the ingredient, not in spite of it. Only then will fine dining realize veganism’s potential.
If the world of fine dining continues on this path, this generation’s defining moment in the evolution of cuisine may just be on the horizon.

El Jefe’s Taqueria has a new location? Kung Fu Tea has a new competitor in town? Why does Harvard Square have not one, not two, but three ramen restaurants? The capricious nature of the restaurant scene in Harvard Square has never been more hormonal than now.
In the past year, students have witnessed restaurants come and go in the blink of an eye. From the consumer’s perspective, new restaurants mean exploring new options. From the business side, however, the rapid overturning of Harvard Square restaurant staples is indicative of the competitive business landscape.
For many Harvard students, 2022 is only their second year back on campus. As a result, many businesses may have used the past in-person year as indicators of student interest. Ones that were profitable remained, while others that were less profitable left. Therefore, while restaurants such as Hokkaido Santouka Ramen have managed to stay on 1 Bow St., businesses like Pressed Juicery and Spyce have had to shut their doors. Owning a physical location in the Square is a costly endeavor due to the valuable Cambridge real estate, so businesses must perform on extremely tight margins.
On the bright side, the rapid overturning of Harvard Square restaurant staples also makes way for contemporary, more appealing competitors to conquer these “hangry” college students. College towns are inherently unique in nature, as their consumer base mostly consists of young people. In many ways, the future of Harvard Square rests in the brilliant mouths of Harvard students.
Furthermore, Gen Z is not the most patient generation. After all, in this day and age, attention spans are becoming shorter and shorter, resulting in impatience and a desire to constantly want the next brand new, shiny thing. The lives of this fast-paced generation revolve completely around 280-character Tweets, sound bites, TikToks, and Instagram Reels.
As a generation that was exposed to technology early on, current college students are collectively seen as lacking patience and diligence. However, this shortcoming gives this specific age group a propensity to consume information and crave innovation. Consumer culture, though, does not merely apply to knowledge gained at Harvard, but also to new foods in the square!
Trends abound both online on social media and in Harvard Square itself. The recent rise of acai bowls, which originated from Brazil, have spread like wildfire across the U.S. and has even made its way to Harvard Square through Playa Bowls. Health foods and smoothies are also incessantly praised by Gen Z, resulting in Mother Juice’s fresh presence in the Smith Campus Center. Even macarons, a French speciality, are found in Cambridge at Le Macaron French Pastries.
More recently, when Gong cha launched its grand opening in Cambridge, they announced a sweet deal for college students on Instagram, {one of Gen Z’s primary social media platforms. Their 29K-follower Instagram account @gongchatea amassed over 400 likes on their Sept. 7 post announcing their buy one get one free deal from Sept. 9 to 11. Gong cha was certainly met with eager students on those three consecutive days, as their lines were out the door, spilling onto Church Street.
Harvard Square businesses have also partnered with startups such as Toppings and Snackpass to offer special discounts to students. Reaching potential consumers through their phones, with food only one tap away, is a clever business strategy that will hopefully continue to appeal to our technology-driven generation for decades to come.
This generation revolves around the internet, technology, and social media, with a trend cycle that never stops accelerating. While trends can come and go in a flash, all businesses can hope to do is remain relevant. Ultimately, the central message for current and future businesses in Harvard Square is quite loud and clear: Gen Z dictates your future.

Directed by Marianna Bassham, the Speakeasy Stage production of Will Arbery’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” is rich, raw, and fresh. This bold performance challenges audiences by presenting a surprisingly unconventional way of listening to and thinking about politics, successful due to excellent work with characterization.
Some people avoid discussing politics, race, and religion and others seek to amplify marginalized voices. “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” offers a surprisingly underrepresented and risky approach: listening — really listening — to the perspectives of white right-wing conservatives.
Set in 2017 during the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency, five Catholic white Republican characters hold the audience’s unadulterated attention for two hours and five minutes, sans intermission, while they argue, disagree, and concur about sociopolitical ideas in the context of religion. The minimal action never leaves its backyard setting, rendering the focus on white right-wing ideas and discourse.
Bassham’s production develops distinct, contrasting, and compelling characters who not only represent different archetypes of white conservatives but also have the depth required for audiences to access them as people with believable emotions and desires, both of which are critical tools for the presumed goals of the play. The actors’ outstanding performances and the simple but effective costume choices contribute to the successful depiction of the characters.
Elise Piliponis and Dayna Cousins deliver remarkable, convincing monologues that draw audiences into their characters’ lives and opinions, both in isolation and in opposition to each other. Piliponis’s Emily, a gentle, deeply pro-life, deeply religious Republican, pulls audiences into her pro-life monologue with a sense of genuine care (about helping women), while Cousins’s Teresa, a headstrong, Trump-loving, Karen-in-training, “Connecticut” Republican, pulls audiences into her pro-life monologue with fiery passion (about preventing murder).
Jesse Hinson’s strong-armed portrayal of Justin, the aggressively masculine, pro-gun Republican works well against Nathan Malin’s Kevin, the not-too-smart, perhaps considered “white trash” Republican, whose well-executed, uncoordinated and unbalanced physicality brings the character’s substance abuse issue to the forefront. Karen MacDonald conveys a striking and formidable Gina, the old-school, anti-Trump, pro-George H. W. Bush Republican, with her commanding stage presence and ownership of the role.
The masterful performances from the actors are complemented by costumes that further emphasize the variety of conservatives represented in the play: a warm and understated cardigan and dress for Emily, a classy pantsuit for Teresa, a flannel shirt and outdoorsy vest for Justin, an untucked and eventually unbuttoned shirt for Kevin, and a neat, mom-appropriate ensemble for Gina. These choices help audiences easily differentiate the characters, which eases the work of differentiating their political positions.
By embracing the differences between these white Republicans, and by humanizing them — which makes audiences more willing to listen to their points — Bassham’s “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” gives viewers a chance to deeply consider hot-button topics from a potentially new vantage point. The characters delve into the nuances of their ideas. They are not just homophobic and transphobic; they push and pull and poke and stretch different aspects of and approaches to homophobia and transphobia until audiences truly grasp their perspective.
Today, after the Jan. 6 insurrection, the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and the Uvalde school shooting — events that had not yet happened when Arbery wrote this play — it seems crooked to listen to people refer to Trump as “the more human” candidate, claim that Planned Parenthood is part of “a system that is evil,” and suggest bringing guns to a school for student “marksmanship training.”
But Bassham’s production neither celebrates nor encourages conservatism or Catholicism. “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” does not push the audience to agree with its characters; it pushes the audience to listen and use that information for whatever purpose — even if just to deepen confidence in liberal beliefs. Examining alternate opinions allows people to better own, grasp, and defend their personal opinions, especially when those alternate opinions are shown in a neutral light.
Audiences will enjoy the humor, the beautiful set (creative lighting combined with a black scrim results in a gorgeous starry night sky effect), and the chemistry and dynamics between the actors on stage — but the greatest impact of Bassham’s production of “Heroes of the Fourth Turning” is its ability to place audiences on an intellectual obstacle course.

Eclectic and full of energy, South London band shame took the stage at The Sinclair on Sept. 7. Returning to North America for the first time in three years, the quintet was excited to perform live for Cambridge’s rock fans. Playing hits from their most recent album “Drunk Tank Pink,” along with several unreleased songs, shame showcased not only their musical breadth but also their lyrical depth while grappling with the anxieties of reality, performance, and finding a place in the world.
After returning home from several years of touring, the band had to transition to “normal life” and experienced internal turmoil that led to the creation of “Drunk Tank Pink,” lead vocalist Charlie Steen told GQ in 2021. Steen barricaded himself in “the womb,” a room painted the shade of pink used to calm drunk tank inmates, and refocused himself from partying to reflecting and making new music. shame’s choice to perform “Alphabet,” “Nigel Hitter,” and “Born in Luton” reflect this shift inwards in their music, becoming a surrealistic exploration of dreams, frustration, heartbreak, and confusion.
“Alphabet,” a track dissecting the dynamic between an entertainer and their audience, received a warm welcome from fans. Enthusiastic shouts of “Monkey see and monkey do” from the crowd were matched by vibrant lyrical responses from Steen. Confronting the absurdity and responsibility of people “waiting to feel good” from shame’s performances, “Alphabet” is a catchy exploration of an artist’s creative frustration. Depicting the cyclical nature of life, “Nigel Hitter” continues this trend by showcasing the ongoing repetitiveness of life, like a never-ending day.
“Born in Luton” continued this crisis of confusion, taking the mundane experience of a lockout and using it to illustrate being an outsider, working towards something you think will make you happy, but could actually hurt you. The slow tempo build-up in the backing guitars as Steen sang “I’ve been waiting outside for all of my life” let fans sit with the lyrics, creating a sense of catharsis before picking up speed again.
shame also showcased their unreleased song “Adderall.” Soft vocals accompanied mainly by the drums were a departure from the commotion of previous tracks, taking things slow and building contrast before returning to the full-bodied sound and vocal fry typical to shame’s music.
After previewing their upcoming releases, the band expressed how excited they were to be back in Boston. Recalling the last time they played in the city to a venue with no more than 20 people, shame was grateful for how much their fan base has grown and the heights they’ve reached, promising they’d be back soon. Steen got up close with the crowd towards the end, crossing the stage and holding his mic out, letting the audience sing with him.
Closing the show with songs “One Rizla” and “Snow Day,” shame kept spirits high. Evoking chants of “well if you think I love you, you’ve got the wrong idea” from fans, “One Rizla” set in motion a sense of confidence and resolution, ultimately achieved by the finale “Snow Day.” Centering the idea of natural beauty that is often overlooked, “Snow Day” took a step back from constant ambition. Accepting the excitement of the unknown, the song ended with a fast-paced instrumental working in tandem with the outro lyrics to paint the picture of a thrilling future ahead.
Shame’s return to the stage was one full of passion and zeal. With songs tackling existential questions and occasionally venturing outside the post-punk genre, the band surely has a promising future ahead.

On July 22, K-pop group NewJeans surprise released their debut single “Attention,” a glittery and Y2K-inspired mix of R&B and pop. The group consists of five members and was born out of a 2019 global audition hailing from ADOR, an independent label under HYBE. Prior to their debut, NewJeans remained a mystery to fans: “Attention” was dropped as a stand-alone piece without a teaser or any information about the group, even the members’ names. Perhaps the strategic silence is what propelled them to attention. NewJeans topped domestic charts and made a debut on Billboard Global within nine days of its release.
Authenticity and effortlessness are at the core of “Attention” and NewJeans’s broader artistic identity. The track begins with echoes of chants and claps, setting a rhythmic motif that underlies the rest of the piece. The opening sequence is joined by a rhythmic layer of syncopated beats, which emerges with an effervescent shimmer. Following a whispered countdown, Hyein’s voice enters the mix. While multilayered, the instrumentation is simple and does not overshadow the vocals. Rather, the syncopation brings out the natural fluctuations of the vocal line, emphasizing its freestyle-like and conversational tone.
The heart-on-your-sleeve lyrics reinforce the authenticity of the voices. “You got me looking for attention . . . One thing’s for sure, I know you’re the one,” the members sing in a bold confession. The vocal line in the chorus is especially simple, each member pursuing a clear and airy falsetto in a solo that they pass around. Their tone is pure, straight, and natural with moments of playful vocal dips that add a whimsical touch. Sincerity and confidence shine through both the lyrics and voices that deliver them, which are enhanced by nostalgic synths in the background.
Deeply Y2K-inspired, the musical and visual direction of NewJeans fall in line with “newtro,” or new retro, a trend in South Korea that recalls the past with a contemporary twist. Considering that the age of the members ranges from 14 to 18, the past they are musically citing is before their time. The group reimagines nostalgia for the past they have never lived through ’90s sounds and visual hallmarks like arm warmers, butterfly clips, and arcades.
Min Hee-jin, the head producer and creative director of NewJeans, explained the idea of timelessness that the group pursues: “Just as jeans have withstood the test of time and found popularity among many regardless of their age and gender, NewJeans aspires to become an icon of generations — one you never grow tiresome of putting on.” With “Attention,” NewJeans promises to rediscover and reclaim the past as well as recast it in modern ways.

Death Cab for Cutie’s 10th studio album “Asphalt Meadows,” released on Sept. 16, isn’t the indie rockers’ first attempt at picking up the pieces of a world in disarray. 2015’s “Kintsugi,” which took its name from the traditional Japanese practice of using metallic lacquer to repair pottery, fused its narrative fragments into a softly lustrous meditation on temporal and spatial distance. Now, instead of smoothing life over with the silver-tongued charm of their early days, the band lets “Asphalt Meadows” grow like weeds fighting through concrete.
Over a snappy guitar riff and offbeat claps on album opener “I Don’t Know How I Survive,” lead singer Ben Gibbard tries to give some reassuring advice: “Listen to the sound of your heartbeat / Growing louder, gaining speed / You’re breathin’ out, breathin’ in.” After a brief pause for air, the music unravels into a strident outburst. Gibbard lets discord engulf his mellow voice while admitting that “These nights, I don’t know how I survive.” He delivers each subsequent recurrence of the phrase with rising intensity until, in the outro, the volume drops to a “whispering, whispering” lull.
The next song, lead single “Roman Candles,”shatters the calm with a bang. Relentless drums and bass herald Gibbard’s initial declaration of conflict. “It’s been a battle just to wake and greet the day,” he sings — but even as sonic sparks fly around him, he never loses his cool. Even his prolonged howls sound more melodic than melancholy. The second verse offers a possible reason for this uncanny composure: “I used to feel everything like a flame / Now it’s a struggle just to feel anything,” Gibbard mourns the former ease of emotion. The chorus highlights his refusal to add fuel to the fire by rekindling the past: “But I am learning to let go / Of everything I tried to hold / Too long ‘cause they all explode / Like Roman candles.”
Similarly forceful percussion fills the title track with resentment against the soul-crushing monotony of urban “asphalt meadows,” where “There’s only one thing that grows / Finding the life through the concrete / Getting trampled under our feet.” A backbeat that lands like heavy footfalls weighs almost too heavily on what might have flourished as a dreamy ballad.
Though Gibbard described “Here to Forever” as a testament to “our impermanence and the anxiety of these times,” the album’s second pre-release single boldly reaches for eternity. “I want to know the measure from here to forever,” Gibbard declares in the chorus, revealing profound curiosity about his near future and eventual legacy. Whether Death Cab will go the way of the ’50s movie stars with whom Gibbard “can’t help falling in love” lies beyond his control, a fact that causes him increasing worry: “Now it seems more than ever there’s no hands on the levers.”
In the face of this uncertainty, Gibbard concludes the album by celebrating one of the most important choices he has the power to make. “I’ll never give up on you,” he repeats over and over on the track of the same name, seemingly addressing both a single person and society at large while raspy guitars lend his declaration a fitting tenacity. “Asphalt Meadows,” Death Cab’s first LP in over four years, will leave many hoping that the band never gives up on music either.

“I eat boys like you for breakfast / One by one hung on my necklace,“ sings American singer and actress Dove Cameron in her latest single “Breakfast.” With her newest release, Cameron offers fans a feminist pop anthem that combines its deliciously dark, classy sound with social satire and political activism by flipping traditional gender roles.
Since coming out as queer in 2020, Cameron — who first found fame as a Disney child star — has taken a more mature and politically charged turn in her music, resulting in songs like “Breakfast.”
The track, released on June 24, focuses on inverting traditional, often oppressive gender norms. In response to the overturning of Roe v. Wade this summer, Cameron felt the need to reinvent the previously less political music video of the same song. “This [decision] feels like we’re going back to the 1950s,” she told Vogue in an interview, so she decided to use a ’50s aesthetic for the setting, objects, and cinematography of the music video.
Its brilliant twist is the reversal of traditional gender roles, highlighting the oppression that people have grown so used to that it doesn’t stand out until turned on its head. Before the song starts, Cameron’s voice plays in the background: “You wanna talk about power? My husband gets to stay at home and watch TV while I work every day,” making clever use of the song’s pre-chorus: “Ooo so you wanna talk about power? Ooo let me show you power.” Sung with an excessively sweet, rich voice, these lyrics attain a mocking, ironic character to satirize men who control and belittle women.
Cameron demonstrates gendered power inequalities in multiple ways: All the executives of the company shown in the music video are female, while male actors play their underlings who serve coffee and deal with unwanted touching. The leading character, played by Cameron herself, mistreats her house husband as he brings her homemade breakfast, intoxicates one of her subordinates, and sexually assaults him. "It's uncomfortable to watch at parts, and that was the aim," Cameron told People. "I wanted to show people how ludicrous these situations are, and how damaging, limiting, trapping and diminishing it feels to be a woman every day."
When the victim later storms out of the office to get an abortion, she laughs with her co-workers: “Oh my god, men are so f*cking emotional, like, get it together, you know,” satirizing the stereotype of irrational, volatile female behavior. Perhaps the video’s most uncomfortable and poignant scene is when the man, after getting the abortion, is told by his doctor that “everything will be okay, but next time, make sure you don’t drink so much and make sure you’re dressed appropriately so you’re not provoking women!” and hands him a brochure titled “Good Moral Behavior for Young Men — How to Stay Pure for Your Future Wife.”
The music video touches on so many crucial and timely topics in feminist discourse — including sexual assault, reproductive burdens, the glass ceiling, abortion rights, and stereotypes — that it far surpasses the song itself in significance. One could also describe them as two sides of the same coin of female empowerment, with the song being a ruthless anthem criticizing male dominance.
“Breakfast”’s instrumentals consist almost entirely of strings with a groovy cello bass line, which surprisingly makes for a remarkably catchy pop song while simultaneously achieving a classy, dramatic sound. Cameron’s raspy, smoky voice placed on top contrasts deliciously with the classical instruments, resulting in a refreshing genre blend. With unapologetic, maniac lyrics such as the chorus’s “I eat boys like you for breakfast” or “let me show you power,” the song, by itself, is a trendy female empowerment song, but the music video adds complex layers of societal critique.
Cleverly evading the cliche of simply revealing the whole thing to be a reverie, the video does not end with the fantasy of flipped gender roles — instead, in a sudden, goosebump-inducing return to our world, a TV reporter announces the overturning of Roe v. Wade with the words “This decision feels like a huge step backward.” Then, the phrase “NOT THE END” appears on the screen, followed by a call to action in the form of voting and donating to selected organizations.
All in all, “Breakfast” is a truly remarkable feminist achievement that demonstrates the myriad ways in which the patriarchy constrains and harms women while simultaneously being an objectively pleasing, catchy pop hit.

With the start of the fall semester, many Harvard students face long reading lists and packed Google Calendars — gone are the lazy summer days of “hot girl reading.” Problem sets and essays might be sucking up every minute of your free time, and the thought of reading for fun might even make you a little queasy right about now, but don’t worry: The Crimson has you covered. If you need a break from studying or if you’ve exhausted Netflix, cozy up with a captivating, quick read recommended by The Crimson. Here are our top book picks for the busiest students:
“Thin Places: Essays from In Between” by Jordan Kisner
Essay collections are a great way to read if you are pressed for time. Each essay is a self-contained topic, so you can easily read as many or as few as you want. Jordan Kisner’s collection of essays is fresh and interesting, on topics ranging from colonial ceremonies on the Texas-Mexico border to experimental religion. Her writing is lucid, and these essays will have you thinking about American culture in a new way.
“The History of Love” by Nicole Krauss
“The History of Love” is short and packs a punch. Krauss, an astoundingly talented writer, crafts a story about a 14-year-old girl’s journey to find the author of a book her mother is translating. Set in New York City, this novel blurs the line between memoir, fiction, and reality itself through its book-within-a-book structure. Full of life and energy, this book posits itself as the anti-obituary, seeking to memorialize and immortalize living people.
“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” by Taylor Jenkins Reid
The entire internet seems abuzz about this book, and for good reason. If you haven’t read Taylor Jenkins Reid’s masterpiece yet, it’s a must. “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” is a sexy, speedy novel about a Hollywood star’s complex public and private life. It’s glamorous and fast-paced, with loveable characters and a twisty, surprising plot. This is fiction at its finest.
“Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood” by Trevor Noah
Generally fairly compact, memoirs are a great way to engage with reading because, as the stories of real people’s lives, they are inherently accessible. And who doesn’t love to read about other people’s drama? Trevor Noah’s memoir is poignant and deeply hilarious. He tells the story of growing up in apartheid South Africa and his journey to becoming one of the most famous comedians in the world. The particularly engaging audiobook, full of Noah’s signature comedic timing and impressions, is another great way to consume this gem.
“When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir” by Patrisse Khan-Cullors and Asha Bandele
“When They Call You a Terrorist” is the must-read memoir by one of the founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Treated as a terrorist by the U.S. government for fighting against racism and white supremacy, Khan-Cullors’s life story sends a compelling message about the state of American justice, the power of speech and resistance, and what it takes to lead a nationwide movement. In 250 pages, Khan-Cullors reveals her difficult, harrowing, and inspiring work. It is a fascinating and important read.
“Night Sky With Exit Wounds” by Ocean Vuong
At just 89 pages, “Night Sky With Exit Wounds” is slim, but it leaves quite an impact. Vuong deftly engages figurative language in his series of poems about grief, family, and love. While his poems are not always transparent, the art is in his word choice. Vuong’s poems are achingly beautiful and well worth reading in your (however limited) free time.

In 1932, science-fiction author and social critic H. G. Wells took to BBC Radio and began to tell the future. Soon, he predicted, anyone would be able to “pack up a parcel of explosives or poison gas or incendiary matter or any little thing of that sort and send it up into the air to travel to just any chosen spot in the world and drop its load.”
Wells found it absurd that hundreds of thousands of students and professors were working diligently on records of the past while nobody worked full-time on estimating the impacts of new inventions and technologies.
“There is not a single Professor of Foresight in the world! But why shouldn't there be?” he asked. “Will there be no Foresight until those bombs begin to rain upon us?”
Ninety years later, many of Wells’ prophecies have come true, but his warnings remain mostly ignored. Many government agencies and companies scramble to anticipate the future — not until 2018 did the U.S. Government Accountability Office create a center that identifies trends affecting policymakers, for example — yet only a smattering of academic programs research and teach necessary skills to navigate the complexity and uncertainty of the future. More often, I hear “the future” used as a buzzword to advertise upcoming products in “the future of work” or “innovation” or “cancer therapeutics.”
Both collectively and individually, we must start deliberately interrogating the future. What do we make of this ongoing verb tense? How different are our visions, and how might we mediate the differences between them? How ought we think about what a good future would look like, for ourselves and others? And how much does our future-imagining influence our future-making?
Over the course of this column, I will interview University professors, professional thinkers, and a broad array of other citizens to collect visions of what’s to come 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 years from now. Their insights are bound to weigh different priorities, and I won’t try to mold them into a coherent fantasy. Instead, I hope to provide some food for thought about where our present ends and our future begins.
According to Hal Hershfield, an associate professor of marketing, behavioral decision making, and psychology at UCLA who agreed to speak with me over Zoom, the relationship between our present and future selves may be more uncertain than we think. Hershfield’s research suggests that the neural patterns that are evoked when considering our future selves often more closely resemble the neural patterns evoked by considering other people than when considering our current selves — one could say that we often treat our distant selves as if they’re strangers.
By contrast, when we perceive our current selves as continuous with our future selves, we experience an emotional sense of connection that correlates with long-term exercise, saving, and potentially even more ethical behavior. Hershfield suggested that I could try to actively draw my future self closer to who I am now by writing letters to and from my future self or witnessing simulations of aged-up versions of myself in virtual reality.
It seems like building a good future will require concretely envisioning our future selves, dilemmas, and decisions. Then, we can connect those projections to our present selves and actions.
How can we more concretely envision the future? Various future studies techniques can help, whether in policymaking or our personal lives. “Backcasting,” for example, asks us to define criteria of a desirable future and then work backwards to specify which programs and actions best achieve those criteria; “horizon scanning” presses us to detect and communicate budding needs or threats. Both techniques draw our distant selves closer.
A decade ago, UNESCO, the United Nations agency which aims to foster peace through the creation and sharing of knowledge, began to teach “futures literacy” as an essential 21st century skill. In UNESCO’s “Future Literacy Laboratories,” participants walk through their explicit assumptions and hopes about the future and then critically imagine and evaluate alternative scenarios. One Laboratory, for example, brought together Egyptian students to imagine shock-resilient wellbeing in 2050, while another assembled Finnish researchers to discuss safety and networks in future cities.
So, let’s think through the years together. I still find it incredible that Cleopatra lived closer to the iPhone launch than to the building of the Great Pyramids. In the next 2,000 years of human existence, what will become of, say, biotechnological warfare, academic institutions, consumer protection, the concept of aging, the practice of data collection, our relationship to non-human life, or what it means to be happy?
Such answers will not come easily. Imagining and developing the future requires futurists trained in sociology and evolutionary biology and game theory and empathy, and it requires us to all seriously interrogate our visions and values.
Our future is a work in progress, and we cannot wait for the bombs to rain upon us.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I want to tell you a story.
It’s the story of an awkward and nerdy, but fundamentally kind-hearted, man. Living alone with his dad, this young man is going nowhere in life — until the fate of the entire country is unexpectedly thrust upon his shoulders. While many doubt and belittle him, our hero grits his teeth and gets to work. After an emotional journey through challenging personal obstacles and difficult interpersonal relationships, he ultimately ends up learning to be more confident in himself than ever before. Over time, we also see him discover that he is adopted, and work to build a healthy relationship with his birth father. We watch him grow closer to his peers, sharing a particularly close yet refreshingly platonic relationship with a female coworker, and winning the affection of his stoic mentor.
Now I’m going to tell you something else. The hero of our story is an anthropomorphic panda. His adoptive father is a goose, and his best friend is a tiger.
Many readers will probably recognize what I’m talking about. Perhaps fans could sense it from the beginning.
I’m talking, of course, about the cinematic force that is the “Kung Fu Panda” trilogy. Using this film, I want to make a case for the unapologetic and sincere enjoyment of children’s films.
By no means am I claiming that all kids’ movies are artistic or complex; certainly, that’s not the case with the “Despicable Me” or the “Trolls” franchises (although even they have delivered their fair share of fun and enjoyment to the TikTok generation). I’m also not advocating that viewing children’s films should replace our consumption of other content. What I am asserting, however, is that movies marketed for kids and families can actually be some of the most well-crafted, thoughtful, and life-changing works of art out there. And they deserve our genuine attention.
When it comes down to it, the beauty of the children’s movie form is that it has to capture and communicate big, complex ideas in easily digestible ways. Admittedly, this is sometimes done by dumbing things down, or by avoiding heavy subjects altogether. But occasionally, kids’ films will strike gold. They will deliver nuanced and touching portraits of life, love, and loss — in simplistic yet deeply symbolic ways.
In other words, what is mundane or understated in a kids’ film out of necessity could actually manifest as just the right level of holding back — what people in the artistic world like to call “subtext.”
As an example, I’ll return to the value of the children’s franchise I opened with: “Kung Fu Panda.” I’m not going to argue that it provides the most refined portrait of body positivity out there (unfortunately, plenty of casual fat jokes are made without hesitation), but it can’t be denied that the films consistently deliver upbeat — and sometimes astonishingly philosophical — messages about self-love and confidence. Amazingly, there’s never a superficial makeover scene or weight-loss montage; instead, the protagonist’s arc is about learning to trust himself, and earning the respect of his peers. The animated fight scenes feature homages to real kung fu techniques, and to top it all off, the films are scored by the prolific Hans Zimmer and John Powell. The visuals are vivid and captivating, the messages are solid, and the musical experience is almost like no other. In fact, the famous piece “Oogway Ascends” is known to be one of the most emotional film soundtracks out there — if you don’t believe me, one clip of it has over 20 million views on Youtube.
Pandas and film scores aside, there’s something crucial that happens when you sit down and earnestly, shamelessly enjoy a good children’s movie. Yes, you’ll probably have a great time, and actually end up realizing it’s a work of art in its own right. But you’ll also slowly grow. When we break down our barriers of what we consider “artistic,” we chip away more and more of the snobbishness and conceit that has often been ingrained in us our whole lives. We become more open to considering a wider variety of content as being worthy of our time; worthy of the lofty title of “Art.” And is there anything more central to art than openness and inclusivity?
I had an English professor once who said that art is anything that moves you. I never asked him to clarify what he meant — mostly because I was terrified of him — but I’ve paraphrased his words into something that makes sense to me. Art is anything that moves you, and not necessarily in the emotional sense, but in the literal sense of movement, where you begin and end in different places. (Something merely making you emotional doesn’t automatically mean it’s art; the fact that I cried watching “Love is Blind” the other day is proof enough of that.) All in all, art is simply anything that means you’re not the same person you were before consuming it, in some meaningful — spiritual, philosophical, personal, or even artistic — way.
I’m not ashamed to admit that I’m not the same person I was before watching “Kung Fu Panda” as an adult. And if you take the time to do so just like I did, neither will you — and it’s not just because it’s an objectively fantastic film. It’s because you’ll be taking your next step, perhaps your first one, towards having a better, wiser view of the world of art around us.

I imagine that hearing of the death of Queen Elizabeth II must have been a paralyzing moment for citizens of the United Kingdom, a collective experience so totalizing that the Kingdom’s ten days of mourning just might not suffice to properly memorialize her tremendously long rule. After all, the world she departed has aged quite a bit since she assumed her reign in 1952, exactly 70 years ago.
But for me, the Queen’s death — her ability to now peacefully populate the pages of history — solemnly reminds me that time can be too kind to institutions of power and their agents; that for the Queen to now inhabit the past is a privilege which her colonial subjects, tortured well into the present by the consequences of British imperialism, will never hold.
In particular, it is a luxury the people of Kashmir — my people, forever shackled to her memory — will never hold. And while the Queen likely forgot Kashmir by the end of her life, the people of Kashmir will not be spared from remembering her name and the suffering she sowed in their land.
Although the Partition of India, Pakistan, and Kashmir in 1947 — a treacherous bloodbath architected by the British that claimed the lives of approximately one million people — predated the Queen’s rule, the Indian subcontinent was still well-inscribed within Britain’s colonial playbook.
Indeed, the nations born of Partition hardly belonged to themselves. India and Pakistan did not triumph post-1947 as paradises of independence; rather, the footprints of the British who had so callously mapped borders and bodies in the Indian subcontinent against each other based largely on religious demographics were not only visible, but also alive. Manufactured by Partition were not new nation-states, but still-breathing artifacts of British coloniality. What had been performed as a profound gesture of decolonization on the international stage had instead only reproduced the horrors of British imperialism.
Kashmir, in particular, became the connective tissue that Britain leveraged to maintain and tighten its colonial gaze in the Indian subcontinent — and, most remarkably, it became the biggest loser in this imperial exchange. It was Queen Elizabeth’s Britain that had consolidated tensions between India and Pakistan by inflaming and prolonging both states’ colonial dreams of acquiring Kashmir, all with no intention to formally intervene in fears of losing economic support in the region.
Indeed, to the British, Kashmir was not a people to protect or a land to be liberated — it was a political balancing act, lives cruelly contorted into the grooves of its colonial imagination. It was Queen Elizabeth’s Britain that trivialized the self-determination of the Kashmiri people, deftly dangling above their heads the fantasy of conducting a plebiscite in Kashmir that would determine whether the region would join India or Pakistan or become its own internationally-recognized state. To this day, almost a century after Britain’s 1948 United Nations Security Council vote in its favor, such a plebiscite has never been held. And it was Queen Elizabeth who considered her political interest in the Indian subcontinent one of “noninterference,” which, frankly, makes me chuckle — because what is more invasive and political than colonialism?
But despite the violence she engineered in my homeland, I do not wish Queen Elizabeth pain in death. I only wish to puncture this protective veil we seem to cast on figures of history, who, upon their death, are allowed to luxuriate in the past, untouched and beautified.
In Kashmir, there is no such thing as the past. Genealogies of occupation in the Kashmir Valley can be traced to the late-sixteenth century, when Sultan Yousuf Shah Chak — the final indigenous ruler of Kashmir — was deposed by the Mughal emperor through a trick of deception now all too familiar to the Kashmiri eye: settler-colonialism, disguised as a call for peaceful negotiations.
Colonization in Kashmir is uniquely embodied. From the toppling of the Shah dynasty to the Valley’s infamous reputation as the most militarized region today, settler-colonialism has crystallized in the bodies of every Kashmiri. For us, one occupier is no different than the other, no history more past than the other. Life in Kashmir bends time and space — and to breathe in Kashmir is not to inhale, but to gasp for air, for relief.
I resent the Queen because, when Kashmiri people die, there is no space in the past for them. When Kashmiri people die, they just disappear — no ten days of mourning, but just ten more days, months, years, and centuries of the same, endless nightmare of occupation.
But these histories are not forgotten; they are erased. Harvard, in particular, knows well the violence inflicted by its own effaced colonial histories, as well as the promise of decolonial knowledge production — knowledge committed to deconstructing our sanitized public memory and honoring the silenced victims of colonialism.
Harvard must expand its probing into colonial encounters, though, beyond its gates. From Harvard to Kashmir and beyond, it is through this kind of counter-hegemonic engagement with institutions of power that we may learn, for once, to empower communities like the Kashmiri people. And it is through this radical attempt at unlearning that we may no longer worship a woman who, before she became a queen, bled the color of a colonizer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, more than 200 Harvard undergraduates took final exams within the first month of the semester.
The Faculty of Arts and Science Registrar administered a total of 208 makeup final exams in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. Students who were unable to take their spring 2022 finals last semester were required to make them up last week — roughly four months after classes concluded.
Some students who took makeup exams expressed mixed feelings about the policy, citing difficulty preparing for the belated test.
“It’s a blessing and a curse. I got more time to study, but at the same time, over the summer, I forgot a lot of material,” John P. Ho ’25 said. “I think it could be more convenient to have the final take place in May. Having alternate dates for you to take the final within the same week that you missed it.”
Scott W. Arbery ’24 said he utilized class resources, including office hours, to prepare for his Ec10b: “Introduction to Macroeconomics” makeup exam.
Julian Giordano ’25 said he received minimal support and communication from course staff for his makeup final.
“The exam, as it turns out, was a different format from the exam that I was expecting to take in May, which was not communicated to us,” said Giordano, a Crimson multimedia editor.
For certain classes, the final exam could make or break a student’s grade.
“Knowing that it was out of my hands, if I did poorly, it was more of a reflection on the fact that it was such a long time in between when I was studying for the class and when I took the exam,” Giselle Chiprez ’25 said. “It definitely felt like I was on my own.”
For some students, making up last semester’s work meant sacrificing this semester’s.
“I had to, obviously, miss classes that day,” Adam S. Mohamed ’25 said. “I guess I would have liked to have more time to study, but since that didn’t happen, retrospectively, I would have preferred to do [the exam] last semester.”
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on student criticisms, pointing to the policy guidelines.
“Regarding makeups, there is quite a lot of communications with both faculty and students,” Dane wrote. “During makeups last week, if a student missed an exam due to positive COVID diagnosis, the Registrar invited them to reach out to exams to see if they could accommodate them on a day this week.”
“The Registrar is holding a special makeup exam day this Wed. for those students who are out of isolation and feel well enough to take it,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A University report issued last week called on Harvard to expand its climate change offerings by hiring new faculty and staff in the field and establishing a standing committee to direct the school’s efforts.
The report, titled “The Future of Climate Education at Harvard University,” was written by a committee tasked with studying the school’s climate change programming. The group consisted of 29 Harvard faculty members and senior teaching administrators from across the University.
The report comes three months after Harvard announced plans to establish a new institute for climate and sustainability that will serve as a hub for climate research and education.
The report offered four overall recommendations for shaping the future of Harvard’s climate education. It called for “faculty hiring, institutionalizing a standing committee on climate education, staffing and substantially funding a climate education accelerator program, and establishing an external climate education advisory committee.”
The committee surveyed students, faculty, and alumni and held focus groups on Harvard’s climate education. The report included testimonies from current affiliates and statistics about student satisfaction with the school’s current offerings.
Only 20 percent of student survey respondents “said there were sufficient opportunities to engage with climate topics outside of class,” according to the report.
About 80 percent of alumni respondents “expressed interest in playing a role in climate education opportunities for current Harvard students,” and 90 percent of student respondents “said they would like to engage with alumni on climate topics as part of courses or in extracurricular capacity,” the report said.
Though there are educational offerings from the Harvard University Center for the Environment and several climate-related classes and undergraduate concentrations, “there are few clear paths for students within schools/departments or across schools to deepen their knowledge and skill set in a structured manner,” the report said.
The committee called on the University to hire more faculty in order to increase the number of advanced climate classes and improve current offerings.
The report also said Harvard should establish a Standing Committee on Climate Education to advance programming, degree, and concentration offerings and explore the potential for a College climate education requirement. Additionally, it suggested the school could “create a climate education accelerator program charged with catalyzing institutional innovation, scaling expertise and impact, and developing partnerships with organizations outside of Harvard.”
In addition to curricular programming, the report called on the University to support opportunities outside the classroom. Harvard’s upperclassmen houses, for example, could help facilitate cross-school interactions between College students and other affiliates, according to the report.
In a message at the front of the document, James H. Stock, Harvard’s vice provost for climate and sustainability, wrote that the report “summarizes the rich offerings in climate education already at Harvard and, importantly, presents a vision of the great potential for expanding Harvard’s efforts in climate education, both on campus and beyond.”
The co-chairs of the committee that authored the report, N. Michele Holbrook ’82 and Dustin Tingley, wrote in the executive summary that the group’s approach “emphasized a process where local groups could meet with their community to understand their needs and develop a vision to share with the larger University committee.”
“A strong and multidisciplinary educational program must be a cornerstone of Harvard’s focus on climate and sustainability,” they wrote.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study welcomed its new cohort of fellows last week who will tackle a range of year-long projects from waste management strategies to feminist poetry.
The Harvard Radcliffe Institute Fellowship Program "offers scholars and practitioners in the humanities, sciences, social sciences, and arts” the opportunity to conduct research at Harvard. This year’s cohort includes 50 fellows and four graduate student fellows from 14 countries.
Throughout the academic year, fellows will carry out projects across various disciplines. Projects chosen by the new fellows include constructing a robotic fish to better understand fish behavior, researching medical technology for chronic disorders, and creating a music series based on models like stock indexes and animal migration patterns.
Lisa I. Iezzoni, a Harvard professor and new Radcliffe fellow, looks forward to working on her project, which will focus on at-home support for individuals with disabilities.
“I am going to be working on a project about the professional support that people with significant disability might need to be able to continue living in their homes rather than being put into nursing homes,” Iezzoni said.
University of Chicago professor Brodwyn M. Fischer ’91, another fellow, said she is excited about the diversity of this year’s class of fellows.
“There’s a lot of racial and ethnic diversity, there's a lot of international fellows, there’s a huge diversity of disciplines,” Fischer said. “And there's also a huge diversity of generations.”
Fischer praised the fellowship program for bringing together a group of professionals who are “so different from one another” and eager to hear each other’s perspectives.
“One of the things that's really special about this fellowship is that it's one of the few places that I've ever experienced where a group of adults — that don't have a lot in common in terms of their work — come together and are actually really curious about each other and really want to enrich each other's work and learn about it,” she added.
Fellows also said they are eager to participate in the Radcliffe Research Partnership program, which pairs them with Harvard undergraduates. Throughout the year, the undergraduates will assist the fellows with their research and receive mentorship.
“I find that having students engaged in the research project is really challenging because often they ask good questions and look at the problem differently,” said Radcliffe fellow Christina L. Davis ’93, a Harvard professor.
“I think that the Radcliffe Research Partnership is a really valuable program for students to get a chance to engage in research and be part of the process,” she added.
Iezzoni said the program has exposed her to “new ways of thinking and new attitudes” so far, adding that she aims to leave her comfort zone during her time at Radcliffe.
“All I can say, a week in, is that my head is spinning — but in a very good way,” she said.

Cuando Rodrigo Ventocilla no estaba estudiando en la biblioteca del Harvard Kennedy School, se dedicaba a algo que realmente amaba hacer: compartir largas veladas con su grupo de estudio en las que los comensales disfrutaban de platos tradicionales de su país de origen, Perú.
La última cena del grupo de estudio fue organizada por un compañero de clase de China. Habían quedado todos para comer hotpot, pero más de una hora después de la cita original de la reunión, Ventocilla no había llegado.
En efecto, llegó a la cena — tarde — pero con un plato propio en la mano: arroz con pollo peruano.
“Llegó tarde porque todavía lo estaba preparando”, dijo Ana Rocío Castillo Romero, amiga de Ventocilla e integrante del grupo de estudio. “Quería compartir el arroz con pollo”.
“Así que hicimos espacio en la mesa y pusimos el arroz con pollo justo al lado del hotpot”, dijo Castillo. “Estaba delicioso”.
Rodrigo Ventocilla nació en Lima, Perú el 7 de julio de 1990. Se graduó como bachiller en economía de la Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú. Ventocilla, un hombre transgénero, era un activista por los derechos de las personas trans en Perú, donde también trabajaba para el Ministerio de Educación y el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas del país.
Ventocilla murió el 11 de agosto mientras estaba bajo custodia policial en un hospital de Denpasar, Indonesia, a donde viajó para pasar su luna de miel con su esposo, Sebastián Marallano. Su familia dice que fue golpeado y discriminado por la policía en Bali. Las autoridades indonesias han negado todas las acusaciones de irregularidades.
Ana Ventosilla, la madre de Ventocilla, contó que su hijo pasó los primeros 40 días de su vida en una incubadora, debido a que ella entró en trabajo de parto cuando tenía solo seis meses de embarazo.
Ventocilla ha sido un luchador desde que era muy joven, dijo su madre.
“Nosotros — yo de religiosa, iba todos los días y rezaba a la virgen para que [lo] pudiera salvar, para que pudiera salir adelante de lo que había nacido [prematuro]”, dijo Ventosilla en una entrevista el mes pasado. “El médico me dijo que [él] era muy [luchador] por su vida porque salió adelante”.
Más adelante en su vida, Ventocilla se convirtió en un luchador por las personas LGBTQ+ en Perú.
Ventocilla había sido un activista LGBTQ+ desde sus años universitarios, cuando le pedía permiso a su madre para conducir su viejo automóvil para asistir a manifestaciones en apoyo de los derechos LGBTQ+, dijo Ventosilla.
“Y yo asustada le decía: ‘sí vas a ir, pero ten cuidado por favor”, dijo Ventosilla. “Alguna que otra ocasión inclusive yo le acompañé”.
En junio de 2015, después de graduarse de la universidad, Ventocilla cofundó una organización de defensa de los derechos de las personas trans, llamada Diversidades Trans Masculina.
Morgan K. Benson, egresada del Kennedy School en el 2022, dijo que gran parte del activismo de Ventocilla consistía en ayudar a las personas trans a encontrar espacios inclusivos.
“Así comenzó DTM”, dijo Benson, refiriéndose a Diversidades Trans Masculinas. “Quería que las personas que necesitaban una comunidad pudieran tener eso”.
Ventocilla conoció a Sebastián Marallano en la época en que fundó Diversidades Trans Masculinas. Si bien se conocían del mundo del activismo y compartían amigos en común, su encuentro “definitivo” ocurrió en una fiesta en el distrito de Barranco de Lima, dijo Marallano en una entrevista este mes.
“Yo ya tenía un crush con Rodrigo”, dijo Marallano. “Él ya me gustaba”.
Después de que Marallano vio a Ventocilla en esa fiesta, un amigo le dijo que se acercara a Ventocilla y le confesara sus sentimientos.
Marallano siguió el consejo.
“Al inicio no me creyó”, recordó Marallano. “Me preguntó si estaba tomando del pelo y le dije que no, que era en serio, que quería conocerlo”.
Durante una manifestación para Ventocilla en Boston el 4 de septiembre, Vic Hogg, un estudiante de HKS de la clase de 2023, dijo que recordaba cómo Ventocilla hablaba abiertamente sobre su amor por Marallano.
Uno de esos momentos ocurrió durante una reunión del “club de los corazones rotos queer”, un grupo formado por Hogg y algunos amigos que estaban pasando por una ruptura.
“Pasamos todo este tiempo hablando de lo deprimidos que estábamos y bla, bla, bla”, dijo Hogg riendo. “Entonces Rodrigo se acercó y empezó a hablar de lo jodidamente enamorado que estaba de Sebastián y de lo emocionado que estaba por todo lo que iba a pasar y por la celebración que iban a poder tener”.
Tras finalizar el semestre de primavera, Ventocilla y Marallano viajaron a Chile, en donde se casaron el 25 de mayo.
“Una de las cosas por las que nos queríamos casar, además de porque nos amábamos, es porque queríamos ver la posibilidad de que yo pudiera ir a Cambridge”, dijo Marallano.
Pero Marallano, quien vivió en Perú mientras Ventocilla pasó su primer año académico en HKS, dijo que nunca tuvo la oportunidad de visitar a Ventocilla en Cambridge porque no pudo obtener una visa.
Colegas de Perú y amigos del Harvard Kennedy School recuerdan a Ventocilla como un defensor de los derechos LGBTQ+ y un estudiante dedicado que pasó muchas horas enfocándose en su trabajo.
Rocío Béjar, quien fue jefa de Ventocilla cuando trabajaba en el Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas de Perú, lo describió como una persona “apasionada” y un “muy buen trabajador”.
Béjar dijo que obtener una maestría en Harvard era el “sueño” de Ventocilla, pero que su objetivo siempre fue regresar a Perú.
“Quería volver, siempre, para hacer algo por su país”, dijo Béjar.
Ventocilla trajo su naturaleza estudiosa a Harvard, donde pasaba muchas horas en la biblioteca del Kennedy School, según Benson, quien se graduó de HKS en 2022.
“Ojalá tuviéramos más recuerdos juntos porque gran parte del año estuvo en la biblioteca”, dijo Benson. “Estudió allí y lo hacía todo el tiempo”.
Benson dijo que algunas de las cosas que más recuerda de Ventocilla provienen de su viaje a Palestina durante las vacaciones de primavera, el cual sirvió de inspiración para que Ventocilla pensara en formas en las que podría “ser solidario con Palestina” en su futuro trabajo de organización.
“Fue un viaje realmente intenso, pero el único día que tuvimos relajado, fuimos al Mar Muerto”, dijo Benson, quien fue compañero de cuarto de Ventocilla durante el viaje. “Nadamos y me corté todo el pie, por lo que fue muy dulce”.
Durante su primer año en HKS, Ventocilla se postuló para vicepresidente de diversidad, equidad y antirracismo en el gobierno estudiantil del Kennedy School. En un mensaje anunciando su campaña, Ventocilla escribió que “el trabajo de diversidad, equidad e inclusión, especialmente la defensa LGBT”, era una de sus pasiones desde la universidad.
“A través de mi experiencia como trabajadora del sector público y activista LGBT en Perú, sé que los temas de racismo, sexismo, colonialismo no deben quedar al margen, deben ser el centro de lo que aprendemos y hacemos en HKS, y después”, escribió Ventocilla en ese momento.
Ana Rocío Castillo Romero, compañera de clase de Ventocilla en HKS y excolega de Perú, escribió en un mensaje de texto que Ventocilla “siempre luchó por sus creencias, por quién era y por sus derechos”.
“Rodri era valiente”, escribió Castillo. “Aunque no lo logró, eso no lo detuvo en su lucha e ideales”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association drew criticism Monday after Harvard Primus — a campus group for first-generation, low-income students — alleged the student government rejected its efforts to establish an HUA diversity, equity, and inclusion team.
A Monday Instagram post by Primus, which had garnered nearly 700 likes as of early Tuesday morning, said the HUA “Rejected PRIMUS’s Plans for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.” HUA leaders refuted the group’s claim in an interview Monday, calling the post “misinformation.”
Primus’ post claimed the HUA “voted against a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Team” over the summer “after a Primus representative reached out to HUA Co-Presidents and Officers.”
The HUA responded in a statement posted on Instagram Monday evening, claiming the organization was “never formally approached by PRIMUS” about the creation of a diversity, equity, and inclusion team.
“Over the summer, a member of PRIMUS spoke to various HUA members informally about her personal idea for a DEI team,” the post from the HUA’s Instagram read. “We asked that student to reach out to us along with other students who might be interested in making a structural change for a discussion. No effort was made to reach out to us after that point.”
According to HUA co-presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24, the Association’s Wellbeing Team currently handles diversity, equity, and inclusion issues, but the HUA is open to establishing a dedicated team for the topic.
The HUA’s bylaws do not grant its executive board the authority to create new teams. The creation of a new team would require amending the organization’s constitution via a College-wide referendum.
A referendum can be initiated by a vote in favor by all members of the executive board or a petition signed by 5 percent of the student body.
Estabine and Johnson said Monday they hesitated to call such a referendum halfway through the year, when the new officer would only be eligible to serve for half of a term. Further, the creation of the team would require two school-wide votes — one to establish the team and one to elect a team leader.
The pair said they planned to reevaluate the need for a dedicated diversity, equity, and inclusion team next semester when officer elections take place.
But Primus representative Laila A. Nasher ’25 said she felt unfairly excluded from discussions over the summer, when this decision was made.
“They do value FGLI voices — however they didn’t value it enough to include us in the meeting when it was not convenient for them,” Nasher said.
Nasher, Primus’s vice president of advocacy, previously served as an Oak Yard Representative in the Harvard Undergraduate Council, which was replaced by the HUA last spring. She also sat on the UC’s DEI Committee, which was chaired by Johnson.
Without immediate support from the executive board, Primus sought to trigger a referendum by a petition for the creation of both an “Inclusion Team” and a “First-Year Class Team,” which they urged students to sign in their post.
“This referendum is a last resort of an unwilling & ineffective student government,” the petition reads.
HUA leaders took issue with the tone of the Primus’s post, which they characterized as incendiary.
“We don’t want tensions to rise as a College community,” Johnson said. “This statement does the complete opposite of that.”
Primus President Mateo J. Velarde ’24 disagreed.
“We personally don’t think it’s harsh because our best intentions are really only for helping the FGLI community at Harvard. We didn’t specifically target anyone for that post,” Velarde said.
Representatives from both organizations expressed interest in continuing discussion. In an email obtained by The Crimson, the HUA requested to meet with Primus leaders along with a representative from the Dean of Students Office.
Still, Nasher said Primus already made consistent efforts to work with the HUA.
“We extended our hand 50 times. You cannot be mad when we didn't do it for the 51st time,” Nasher said. “And we are going to do it for the 51st time.”
Correction: September 25, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated a referendum can be initiated by a vote in favor by all but two members of the Harvard Undergraduate Association's executive board or a petition signed by 5 percent of the student body. In fact, a referendum can be initiated by a vote in favor by all members of the Association's executive board or a petition signed by 5 percent of the student body.

Goodbye hot girl summer, welcome to cuffing season. Here are ten places you can maybe find ~love~ at Harvard (even if it’s just for a semester because you realized all your classes are gems and are now looking for some unnecessary stress in other departments).
The Quad Shuttle
You’re going to the Quad. They’re going to the Quad. Except you’re late for the bus, and you run to catch the shuttle even though the last time you ran was four and a half months ago. Like anyone would, they hold the door for you, but then your eyes meet, and sparks fly. Suddenly everything is clear: your wedding will take place on the steps of Memorial Church, and you’ll be the Harvard couple everyone wishes they could be.
3 A.M. at Lamont
If you’re both Lamonsters — isn’t that already a date? There’s just something about the ~secluded alcoves ~ in the Lamont basement. All those whiteboards on wheels — it’s almost like the librarians knew what they were doing. Your confirmed compatibility rating is nothing short of 11/10.
Any of the Gyms. Any. 
Mac or QRAC, House gym or Hemenway — anyone at the gym has (or is at least faking) a balanced lifestyle. Find someone who puts themselves first, before grades and all the 74,383 club comps. Or don’t. We would have to go to the gym to confirm this, so this is just a hypothesis.
Elliot & Adams Tunnels
From one entryway to another, we hope you meet your match (and not the rats) as you escape from blockmates and everyone in between. A romantic rendezvous after dinner? We think yes. Just try not to get lost in this Romeo and Juliet love affair — the tunnels won’t be fun if you can’t find your way out.
Pfoho Bell Tower
Allegedly where Mark Zukerberg, our most famous alumni-ish, met his wife while waiting in line for the bathroom after a party. Maybe the Quad isn’t all that bad? Or maybe, love just blossoms in cursed places. Either way, we don’t mind — go find yourself a future billionaire!
Cronkhite. 
With hot breakfast in the mornings and more privacy than the other accommodations, Cronkhite may be a blessing in disguise. Located away from the other eleven swing houses, Cronkhite offers the perfect duo: singles and seclusion. Walk the walk, minus all the shame. Need we say more?
Sanders Theater 
We get it, you’re into security and financial stability. Go get your Computer Science and Economics cutie and let us know if the pset-to-lovers pipeline is real. Try out this location, and you may end up with the gift of having perpetual scooter access for the rest of your time at Harvard <3
Cambridge Common
Picnics? Frisbee? In a small-to-medium-sized park filled with members of the greater Cambridge community? Sounds like the perfect place to meet someone as long as you can avoid all the children… Also where one-fourth of freshmen have their first date (source: trust me).
Smith Collaborative Commons
Situated right in the Square, you can grab food after classes and then head to your study date in an area designated for chatting away. You could finish that Pset or plan for the next big startup. Alternatively, study here every day for one week, and you’ll meet half the student population. Attempt the art of study speed dating and hop from table to table until you find the one.
Lowell Co-Ed Bathrooms
With only a few sinks and stalls, the Lowell bathrooms are still limited in number and used by everyone. Although every now and then you’ll get a shocked civilian who enters and exits within 0.0003 seconds — eventually, you may find yourself brushing your teeth next to the same person every day or having the same nighttime routine. Get married.
Hope you find the LOYLFTS (love of your life for this semester),
Xoxo,
flyby
