After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When  English renaissance poet John Lyly famously quipped, “All is fair in  love and war,” he probably did not want to be taken literally.  Unfortunately, the characters in Thomas Kyd’s masterpiece, “The Spanish  Tragedy,” did not quite understand the nuances of this expression. If  they did, then their story probably would not have devolved into a  spectacular orgy of violence.
“The  Spanish Tragedy,” being staged at the New College Theatre (NCT) through  October 30 and directed by Meryl H. Federman ’11, is the Hyperion  Shakespeare Company’s latest offering. It is also the first play they  have put on not penned by Shakespeare. However, this work was the ideal  piece to expand the company’s artistic horizons. Although Kyd was a  rough contemporary of Shakespeare, “The Spanish Tragedy” predates most  of the Bard’s classic pieces of theater and utilizes many dramatic  devices that were later made famous in plays like “Hamlet,” such as the  play-within-a-play structure and the use of ghosts onstage. Although  Federman’s adaptation has some flaws, the production is carried by  commendable acting from the leads and some ridiculously over-the-top  stage fights.
The  play is a classic revenge tragedy set in the Spanish court, which is  celebrating its most recent victory over the Portuguese and the capture  of Portugal’s crown prince Balthazar (Nathan O. Hilgartner ’14).  Bel-Imperia (Harleen K. Gambhir ’14), the niece of the King of Spain,  falls in love with Balthazar’s captor, Horatio (Peter K. Bestoso ’14).  Balthazar, who is in love with Bel-Imperia, is peeved by her lack of  interest. To remove his competition for Bel-Imperia’s hand, he decides  that the best course of action is to team up with her brother Don  Lorenzo (Spencer J. Horne ’14) and kill Horatio. Horatio’s murder, in  turn, makes Horatio’s father Hieronimo (Joshua O. Wilson ’13)  understandably incensed, and his quest for vengeance dominates the rest  of the play.
This  production approaches the violence in the play with the type of gusto  that is usually found in Quentin Tarantino movies, as the stage is  literally drenched with fake blood while the cast members stab, shoot,  and hang each other. The various murders and revenge killings are campy  and excessive, and the technical aspects match this playful spirit. For  example, when Lorenzo kills Horatio, who has been tied to a tree, he  shouts and runs him through with his knife. He then stabs him again for  good measure, and the audience clearly sees that Horatio’s shirt is  soaked with an appropriate amount of fake blood.
However,  the play never lets the audience forget the ethical consequences of the  characters’ bloody deeds. The ghost of Don Andreas (Nathaniel Koven),  Bel-Imperia’s ex-lover who was killed during Spain’s war with Portugal,  is on stage for the entire play. His outrage at the actions of the main  characters serves as a moral compass that reminds viewers how they  should react when witnessing the murders of innocent people. This detail  is a smart touch by Federman, who also handled the large set pieces  admirably.
However,  this meticulous attention was not evident throughout the whole production.  Several moments of the play suffer from blocking so awkward that the  actors have their backs to the audience. The spotty lighting,  particularly in one scene where the entire stage goes dark just as an  actress is walking down the stairs to deliver a monologue, detracts from  the viewing experience as well.
While  the performances are generally respectable, it is Wilson in his role as  Hieronimo who steals the show. His portrayal of the character as a  pained old man grieving for his son and at points dipping in and out of  sanity is very compelling. He especially excels with his monologues  during the second act, where he lets his veneer of strength fade to show  the audience a glimpse of the emotional torment he is suffering. Horne  also distinguishes himself in his interpretation of the brutal and  cynical fop Lorenzo, whose over-the-top aristocratic airs are at once  hilarious and chilling.
At  three hours and 15 minutes, “The Spanish Tragedy” is a lengthy affair  not for the faint of heart. Yet for those who thought the excess of  blood in the movie “Saw” was tame, it is worth sitting through various  awkward blocking mishaps and some mediocre scenes if only for the  stellar lead performances and a truly ridiculous ending. This adaptation  is a treat for literary purists and violence junkies alike.

Audiences  unanimously exclaimed “Madhouse!” when Luigi Pirandello’s “Six  Characters in Search of an Author” was first performed in Rome in 1921,  and it’s no wonder why. The show is full of twists and turns as its  characters—some aware of their identity as fictional beings and others  ignorant—reveal secrets to each other and the audience as they try to  explain the significance of drama.
The  Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) production of this show—which  ran from October 21 to 23 in the Loeb Experimental Theater and was  directed by Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13—proves a gut-wrenching rendition.  Aided by the impeccable performances of its main actor and actress, “6  Characters” successfully portrays the poignant storyline of an  almost-century-long show in a fun and modern context.
The  play starts with a ruthless director (Nee-Vogelman, who plays his own  technical role onstage, as does the rest of his staff) bossing around  the comically incompetent actors in his show, when six individuals who  claim to be perpetual characters enter and demand to have their story  performed. This strange family—which consists of a mom, a dad, and four  children from two different fathers—is clad entirely in black and white,  creating a striking difference between them and the other, more  vibrantly dressed actors on stage.
The  issues in their interpersonal relationships are immediately obvious, as  the older son (Benjamin A. Silva ’14) refuses to look at or acknowledge  the rest of his family. The plot further thickens when nuances of  deception and incest are detectable between the father character (Daniel  W. Erickson ’14) and his step-daughter (Renee R. Donlon). Throughout  the play's 95 minutes, these  characters struggle through their deep-seated issues with one another in  order to explain the importance of their story. A crushing discovery at  the end reveals the true source of their devastation and the reason  they must remain characters, instead of real people.
“6  Characters in Search of an Author” is so bizarre at some points that  this show might not have worked if its main actors aren’t completely  dedicated to their roles. Erickson and Donlon are, in a word,  captivating. They fully embody the actions of their characters, whether  through maniacal laughter or displays of deepest remorse. Their riveting  performances bring energy to both the stage and the other actors upon  it. They also effectively find a balance between being ridiculous and  serious, evoking laughter from the audience in one scene and then  sophisticated thought in another. Displaying their range of talents,  Erickson and Donlon even perform a musical duet toward the beginning of  the show, with Erickson playing violin and Donlon singing.
Their  performances don’t trump those of the other actors, but certainly give  them a run for their money. Silva, who maintains a dark and disturbed  air throughout the production, also entertains, while the regular actors  on stage provide comic relief. Cracking jokes at each other in a  presumably improvisational style, these actors keep performing  throughout all of intermission, the funniest by far being the Lead Actor  (Cyrus Dahmubed).
A  simple set, which is supposed to resemble a stage in a theater, accents  the show. However, intense theatricality is not missed, as the  relatively small venue in which “6 Characters” is performed allows the  actors to come right into the audience with ease.
What  is kept plain in this production is made up for in modernism. The play  was originally written in Italian by Pirandello and then translated for  this performance by Brandon J. Ortiz ’12. This new translation allows  for some creativity with regard to specific lines and costumes, such as  references to Lady Gaga and the flannel-shirt-clad stage crew,  effectively updating the show while maintaining its original themes and  messages.
Full  of both profound messages about the world of theater and subtle nuances, “6 Characters in Search of an Author”  proves highly entertaining for such a modest production. The script  keeps both viewers and actors on stage guessing until the very end, and  the powerful performances of several main characters create a  captivating energy. Audiences may walk out still confused about the  truth of what happened in the story, but as the Director exclaims, “The  truth? This is theater, the truth is what we say it is.”

Anyone  who has ever been in an acting workshop can attest that what happens in  these classes—improvisational exercises where actors, for example,  produce bizarre noises and tell stories one word at a time—bears few  similarities to a final product onstage. Yet, these silly exercises and  games often contribute invaluably to an actor’s performance.
Annie  Baker’s Obie Award-winning “Circle Mirror Transformation” takes this  idea one step further. The play—which runs through November 14 in a  Huntington Theatre Company production at the Calderwood Pavilion's  Wimberly Theatre—suggests that these games tap into the spirit not just  of performances, but also of the people behind them. A compelling  conceit to engage in profound character exploration, this concept  becomes theatrically lethal as the play goes on. The Huntington  production suffers from this slow pacing, but otherwise proves to be a  sturdy version of an ultimately absorbing show.
Presented  as part of the Shirley, Vt. Plays Festival in conjunction with the  SpeakEasy Stage Company (“Body Awareness”) and Company One (“The  Aliens”), “Circle Mirror Transformation” follows six weeks of a  community-center acting class run by enthusiastic instructor Marty  (Betsy Aidem). As the weeks go by, Marty and her four students connect  with each other—as well as learn about themselves.
The  theater games they play prove to be a window into these relationships,  sometimes blurring the line between acting and reality. At the start of  each class, a character delivers a monologue about one of the others,  often providing as much insight into the speaker as the subject. Marty,  nurturing and motherly, comforts distressed teen Lauren (Marie  Polizzano) as she discusses the girl’s troubled past. Divorcé Schultz  (Jeremiah Kissel) gushes about former actress Theresa (Nadia Bowers),  with whom he went on a recent date, and reveals his penchant for  over-enthusiasm that only comes back to hurt him.
Yet,  these exercises and games grow tiresome and repetitive. Not all of them  make for gripping onstage moments—the “counting” activity repeated each  week takes up too much stage time—and cause the show to drag. Director  Melia Bensussen brings an understandably natural feel to this world,  allowing pauses to linger—but without the tension to sustain such  silences, they fall flat.
Still,  such introspection framed by relationship dynamics is by and large  fascinating to watch, particularly due to the generally strong  performances delivered by the small cast. Baker provides an unusual  temporal scenario—six weeks in the characters’ lives depicted only  during class and select short breaks between games—through which these  actors can slowly reveal their characters. Some do so more effectively  than others.
Kissel’s  performance in particular is heartbreakingly authentic, positioning  Schultz as less a caricature of a hopeless sad sack than a man desperate  for renewal and excitement. As Marty, Aidem sometimes does fall into  caricature. However, her final moments in the play almost make up for  earlier superficiality when she gains sudden depth as a woman broken by  her marriage to husband James (an excellent Michael Hammond).
Polizzano’s  Lauren starts as easily the most forgettable character on stage; she  barely speaks, let alone interacts with the rest, and quickly sinks into  the background. Yet by the play’s stunning conclusion—well worth the  repeated tedium that occasionally precedes it—Polizzano is entrancing.
This  ending, which leaves its nature to the opinions of the audience, proves  an exercise itself in the metamorphic power of theater. Lighting  designer Dan Kotlowitz beautifully shifts the dance studio set—designed  with precision by Cristina Todesco—into an abstract reality, and the  characters feel at last whole and real. Just as the game of the play’s  title suggests, they have transformed.

Whether in ABC’s “Modern Family” or the recent film “The Kids are Alright,” pop culture reflects an increasing heterogeneity of the family unit—a fact that current U.S. law fails to recognize. The rule that a child can have at most two legal guardians is antiquated and should change to recognize the complex family structures that exist today.
The law, which now limits the number of parents to two, represents a Western conception of the family unit that is not standard across cultures. Many traditions feature a closeness of kin that may put other relatives, often grandparents, in parent-type roles, and the law should accurately recognize this intimate connection.
Moreover, the law as it stands is unwieldy, particularly in the case of divorce. In such situations, it is common for a new parental figure to enter the equation. Preventing that new figure from certain rights or pushing out the biological parent can lead to a contentious upbringing for the child. Given the prevalence of divorce in the U.S., and 40 percent of divorces involve couples with children, a failure to adjust for this situation is socially irresponsible.
Another increasingly common circumstance that ought to be treated with more flexibility is the case of sperm donations and adoptions in which a third party or parent remains a significant player in the raising of the child. Fortunately, two 2007 cases—one in Ontario and one in Pennsylvania—resulted in sperm donors receiving full parental status and custodial rights, respectively. However, this is not typically true. Without adjustment, unconventional-family disputes could result in outcomes detrimental to a child’s upbringing.
Some critics have expressed concerns that legal and logistical headaches will undoubtedly arise if the law recognizes multiple guardians. However, if the end result of the inclusion of more parents benefits the child’s well being by guaranteeing that child a caregiver and sustaining a connection between parent and child, it is well worth the added legal complications.
Others argue that children will now find themselves acquiring any number of parents simply because adults can legally gain this status. However, we do not expect any such influx to occur, as the notion of a parent remains serious and brings with it significant financial and familial responsibilities. We instead expect the vast majority of children to maintain just two parents, with the law allowing flexibility for more parents in situations that warrant it.
It is unfortunate that the law has not yet changed to mirror the realities of children’s lives and instead relies on an antiquated, arbitrary notion that misses the nuances present in the modern-day family. Whether due to divorce or cultural customs, adoption or in vitro fertilization, the family unit of today is complex, and a child should not be harmed because of America’s resistance to acknowledging that fact.

Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether or not vaccine manufacturers could be sued outside the traditional “vaccine courts” over damages potentially caused by their products. Its hearing has brought renewed interest on vaccine safety and has been used as a rallying cry for thousands of families with vaccine-injury cases in the litigation pipeline. The impact of the court finding against manufacturers is enormous; their spokespeople, both in the past and today, have warned that lawsuits would make it economically infeasible to produce vaccines.
There is a problem here, and it isn’t the current litigation model in place for vaccine compensation. The problem is that overly permissive public discourse has allowed vaccines to be framed as dangerous products without strong scientific backing, confounding Americans who have begun to question the safety of public health’s arguably greatest innovation. A September 2009 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 40 percent of Americans had at least some degree of uncertainty about whether MMR, polio, and whooping cough vaccines were safe, despite those vaccines being scientifically proven to carry only an infinitesimally small chance of causing any sort of severe reaction. Blogs focusing on autism have picked up the Supreme Court story, committed to the belief of a causal link between childhood vaccinations and autism. A vast number of the pending vaccine-injury cases are brought by parents of autistic children, convinced of the role that immunizations have had with their child’s condition.
Arguing with facts alone has not been helpful. Though numerous epidemiological studies have been carried out debunking that assertion, more and more Americans are becoming skeptical and making the choice to opt out of some or all vaccinations over fears of autism. That choice has threatened this country’s combined immunity against illness and brought about a resurgence in vaccine-preventable illnesses such as whooping cough. In the face of all this evidence, anti-vaccine crusaders have been able to successfully frame vaccines as “a matter of choice,” grounded in alleged scientific literature including a famous, now-debunked Lancet article that suggested the initial link. Vaccinations have been permitted to become an issue of personal liberty, rather than an essential health benefit that we should feel compelled to embrace.
The public health and scientific community is getting pummeled in the battle for America’s attention, as numerous news and media sources allow people to hear multiple sides to vaccines, not all of which have rigorous scientific backing. The discursive permissiveness may be due to the very nature of science, which bases its progress on innate skepticism toward convention. Science requires there to be uncertainty in measurements and analysis, yet that inherent uncertainty is not necessarily translated accurately from the scientific realm to the public arena. In addition, the heavier reliance on statistics within public health means researchers cannot give the “100 percent” that is so revered among a public seeking concrete, definitive answers, yet for all intents and purposes a statistically significant finding ought to carry that same weight.
It is imperative for public health officials to be able to construct the debate over vaccinations in a manner that is easily accessible to the average individual. The Risk Characterization Theater, a model that darkens seats on a seating chart of a theater to express odds and risk, is the type of analogy that should be considered when trying to conduct outreach to wary Americans; it promotes a mode of understanding that can be quickly grasped by the average person. In addition, public health officials must recognize there exists a conflict in values that explains why some refuse to comply despite proof to the contrary. Officials would do well to remember the case of Singapore during SARS, which proved the importance of building trust and engaging in active dialogue to maximize compliance with a populace that did not always possess a full understanding of the facts and issues.
Any continued fall in our country’s vaccination rates will be amplified many times over as time progresses. It is crucial to reverse this trend and encourage Americans to have the same faith in the public health apparatus that allowed it to eradicate smallpox and polio. We must battle falsehoods and cure the fear that inhibits the progress of our health. The horrors of diseases past have no place in our modern society.

Hooked on the arm of editor George Andreou, wrapped in a black jacket that made him appear even more diminutive than usual, author V.S. Naipaul put in a Cambridge appearance Friday evening to read from his new book “The Masque of Africa.” His voice had the quality of a well-preserved old recording, managing to find its way into every corner of the room while still remaining somehow beyond it. Following a brief discussion, an audience member inquired how one might rebuild post-apartheid South Africa given the presence of a super-cycle. Naipaul clearly did not understand the question, but his magisterial British accent reinforced his answer-in-triplicate: “I don’t know, but they have to. They have to. They have to.”
Edging on 80 years old, Naipaul is, at this point, a literary institution. Crowned with a Nobel Prize in Literature in 2001, his work—spanning 30 books and 50 years—has shifted over time increasingly into the realm of nonfiction. The “Masque of Africa,” his newest book, takes Naipaul into familiar territory, featuring provocative interviews and descriptions of “superstitious” belief systems based in places (in this case, West Africa) far from his reader base in Britain and America.” In fact, it is territory so familiar that at this point, one must wonder about the ambitions of an increasingly shaky Naipaul in taking off yet again to what he sees as the world’s darkest corners.
Naipaul made his name at the start of his career with “An Area of Darkness,” the disillusioned 1964 chronicle of his visit to India detailing the then-still-extant caste system, religious conflict, and bureaucracy he encountered. A pet target for reviewers keen to lambast him, the book is often cited as bitter evidence of the immigrant tendency to establish oneself in a new society by very pointedly denigrating one’s roots. But to me, at least, the collection of crisp sketches remains gripping. Although one must read critically, understanding the less-appealing aspects of the country remains necessary. “An Area of Darkness” was assigned reading at my father’s Bombay university at a time when Naxalite movements were sweeping the east and central regions of the country; today, Naxalism in India is experiencing a resurgence as villagers in conditions of stark poverty resort to violence against landlords when illiteracy, lack of access to legal process, and isolation from cities leave them without options. Both believers and those seeking economic equality, in other words, continue to face challenges.
If Naipaul’s early work was head-clearing, however, Naipaul didn’t build on it. “My theme is belief, not political or economic life; and yet at the bottom of the continent the political realities are so overwhelming that they have to be taken into account,” he introduced his new book—a promising start. Yet he never actually does get around to writing on how belief can coexist with the political. (The way “economic life” disappears in this sentence is also odd.) In “The Masque of Africa,” it’s the quaintness and brutality of primitive religion, the “malaria, witchcraft, and mangoes,” that draws him: “I had a romantic idea of the earth religions. I felt they took us back to the beginning, a philosophical big bang, and I cherished them for that reason.” He describes with relish the native consumption of the eboga plant intended to induce the trance-like state required for ancestral communication, the axe-split deer heads sitting at market, the guinea pig blood drunk under the supervision of a medicine man, the crocodiles in a moat fed live chickens.
Naipaul goes on to concede that paganism can also be a “dark abyss,” which, while providing meaning, can also condone savage acts. Upon seeing evidence of animal sacrifice in South Africa, he writes: “I thought it all awful, a great disappointment… I expected that a big struggle would have created bigger people, people whose magical practices might point the way ahead to something profounder.” The “profounder” way ahead for Naipaul, however, remains unnamed. It is not Christianity or Islam, which in previous books he has said assume fundamentalist tones when transplanted; areas in Africa adopting “foreign” religions—like northern Nigeria—receive his dismissal. But as one who has never practiced any other career than writing, Naipaul provides no alternative. For Naipaul, to be a writer and interviewer means to embody the “objective,” secular West, no matter the opinions that his books actually put forward. Indeed, this lack of experience is something of which he is proud; on the back flap of “Masques of Africa” and in every one of Naipaul’s books is printed the line: “After four years at University College, Oxford, he began to write, and since then has followed no profession.” At bottom, despite his fascination in this book with primitive religions, his preference for a content-free, “ objective” Western secularism may lead him to continue advocating a transition away from belief altogether.
In that sense, perhaps we must read Naipaul against himself. Naipaul’s fascination with the beliefs of the countries that he visits can also suggest a recognition that the worth of any culture lies not in its economic success but in the strength and variety of its beliefs, in the individual humans, and the groups and institutions they create. Sitting in Harvard Book Store and taking notes on Naipaul’s book, I could hear the journalist Robert Kaplan speaking on the “rise of India and China.” In its loving attention to the smallest details of belief, Naipaul’s book is itself a potent attack on the economically reductionist image of the “Asian tiger.”
On the surface, though, Naipaul’s elegiac prose confronts us with a blank face. Like Naipaul, we might travel to “exotic” distant countries (even if they are technically our roots); we might, like him, collect picturesque details of ancient traditions, remarking on how much better off these places would be if nothing Western—religion? capitalism?—had wormed its way in. The scattering of aesthetically pleasing anecdotes we’d collect might even fill a modestly sized book. But a few months later, settled in an armchair in Brattle Street Theatre, we’d find ourselves addressing an audience of Cantabridgians expecting insights on what to do next. What, then, would we have to say?

In modern society, desensitization is rife. Few would disagree on this point; people of all ages are bombarded with an unprecedented level of content—much of which is sexual or violent in nature. Studies have even proven the existence of “a physiological desensitization to violence.” In that sense, the main point of contention on this issue is not whether desensitization occurs, but how large of a problem it presents and the degree to which regulatory bodies or ratings agencies such as the Motion Picture Association of America should actually take action to shelter consumers (and especially young consumers) from such content.
The implication here is that desensitization refers to the process of becoming numbed to material that would shock an unprepared individual and that this process of numbing somehow erodes our natural inhibitions toward the subject matter in question. Incidents such as the Columbine massacre have been held up as evidence that violent video games increase the chances of violence, while many media outlets jump at any opportunity to decry the objectification and degradation of social mores that they attribute to the influence of overtly sexual music videos. The news, too, consists too often of a mix of calamity and pablum that all too quickly becomes the norm.
This use of the word “desensitization,” however, does not capture its full meaning. “Desensitization” is used almost exclusively today to refer to a transition from a state of unfamiliarity with, and therefore sensitivity toward, negative material to a state of jadedness to such content. Rarely, though, is it used in the opposite sense: the transition from a state of wonder at the amazing things in our world to a state of indifference towards them.
The reason for this would seem to be a lack of appropriate exposure. After all, with so much suffering and mediocrity on the daily media menu, what’s left to acclimate us to those few things that are truly special? Yes, there may perhaps be the occasional brilliant sunset or moving film that impresses upon the observer the inherent beauty of the world, but these are few and far between—certainly not common enough for us to become used to them.
Here it’s important to recognize the distinction between the desensitization that is occurring now and the desensitization that has already occurred in the past. Essentially, we have already been utterly desensitized to most of the central rules that exert the greatest influence over our lives.
The best example of such a rule—because it provides the basis for so many consequential interactions for humans—is evolution. While the actual process of evolution is not observable on a personal scale, it nonetheless has made possible every incredibly complex and improbable action that allows us to exist, from our ability to transform food into parts of our bodies to our ability to absorb light, sound, chemicals, and pressure from our surroundings and integrate them into a cohesive interpretation of reality. Such abilities and the excruciatingly long and slow path taken by life toward achieving them are but one example of the myriad factors that have combined by coincidence to make possible literally every facet of the human existence.
The key point to take away here is that, despite what one may assume based on common usage of the word “desensitized,” we’ve been desensitized to the good in life far more than to the bad. Although there are many ills in the world that deserve our attention, we should take time to reflect on how lucky we are to exist in such an advanced state at all.

Innovations in communication technology are poised to play a crucial role in resolving the national economic crisis by stimulating job growth, according to Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski.
As part of the ongoing Views from Washington series at Harvard Law School, Genachowski said last night that he believes governmental transparency is at an all-time high, and the ability of citizens to access and act on information is “nothing like we’ve ever seen before.”
The move toward more open channels of communication, particularly on the Internet, is crucial for the stimulation of economic growth, according to Genachowski. He cited the FCC’s own efforts in this regard, such as the digitalization of documents, the creation of a broad data map, and the publication of data in the FCC system’s application programming interface.
“I’m a big believer in the idea of opening up our data and information to a broader audience,” he said. “We have to keep the Internet open for innovation, open for speech.”
But Genachowski said that the government still needs to accelerate its efforts to broaden access to the informational infrastructure for Americans with disabilities.
Nongovernmental sources have developed significant innovations to promote informational access for people with disabilities, such as Apple’s series of iPhone applications specifically tailored for disabled individuals, according to Genachowski.
Moreover, America’s success in the realm of technology during the last century actually makes it more difficult to maintain the same level of performance today, he noted. Innovations made in the 20th century have “created a series of legacy issues that pose a challenge for us to be globally competitive in the 21st century,” Genachowski said.
Jonathan T. Thrope, an HLS student who attended the talk, said that he felt relieved to know that the FCC chairman was conscious of America’s struggle to remain competitive in the global technological economy.
“It’s nice to hear that he is very aware of that and working to make sure America doesn’t fall even further behind,” Thrope said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences has experienced nearly a decade of  overall faculty growth, but its subset of junior faculty has  dramatically fallen in the last two years—partly due to reduced hiring  in the wake of the financial crisis.
The number of junior faculty—professors who are eligible for promotion to tenure—increased in proportion to the overall FAS faculty throughout the early 2000s. But the cohort of junior faculty decreased from a stronghold of 207 in 2006 to 178 members today, according to the FAS Dean’s Annual Report released last week.
In contrast, the University’s largest school has expanded its overall tenure-track and tenure faculty from 701 in 2006 to 721 members today. The FAS faculty has grown about 16 percent over the past decade alone, the report shows.
FAS administrators and faculty members partly attributed the lacuna in the junior faculty to the slowdown in hiring instituted in response to the financial crisis that rocked the school for the past few years. In Dec. 2008, FAS announced a hold on a bulk of current searches for tenure-track and tenured faculty as part of cost-cutting measures.
According to the report, recent hires have not kept pace with the usual attrition to the ranks of junior faculty, including departures and promotion to tenured positions within the school.
But the FAS ratio of junior to senior faculty is considerably smaller than that at peer institutions. Junior faculty at FAS compose about 25 percent of the tenure-track and tenured faculty.
At Yale, for instance, junior professors compose about 36 percent of its tenure track and tenured faculty in the arts and sciences as of last fall. At Princeton, 34 percent of the tenure track and tenured faculty are junior professors.
Over the last decade, FAS and the University as a whole have emphasized  the tenure track process at an institution that has traditionally focused on drawing experienced academics from outside Harvard and hiring them to tenured positions.
History Professor William C. Kirby served as the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences when the school transitioned to a tenure-track system in the early 2000s.
“I don’t think there is a magic ‘formula’ or ratio between tenured and untenured faculty,” he said in an e-mail statement. “But again: a strong and sizeable cadre of assistant and associate professors is in my view essential to the academic excellence and vitality of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.”
The social sciences division in FAS has experienced the most significant drop in junior faculty numbers, according to Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Elena M. Kramer, who spoke at last week’s Faculty meeting on behalf of the Standing Committee on Women, which conducted a year-long review of the hiring and promotion process.
In the History Department, less than 15 percent of the faculty listed on the department website—or six of the 48 tenure-track and tenured professors—are junior faculty. Two are on leave for the current semester.
“We are weaker in several fields than we would like to be,” James T. Kloppenberg, chair of the history department, wrote.
“Of course Harvard will continue to appoint very distinguished senior faculty, a step that is important to maintaining our standing,” he wrote.
“But we must also continue to appoint junior faculty, who bring energy and new points of view,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Deborah Bial, president and founder of the youth leadership development program Posse Foundation, highlighted the differences in quality of higher education and career opportunities faced by students from different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds yesterday at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
Bial, a 2007 MacArthur Fellow and 2004 HGSE graduate, challenged the concept of “merit” as defined by traditional indicators such as standardized test scores and GPA in front of an audience of about 100 students and local educators.
These indicators, she said, jeopardize equal opportunities for education and success for students from poorer backgrounds, many of whom are black and Latinos who do not perform well on standardized tests due to a lack of resources.
Black and Latino students are largely underrepresented in the nation’s top-ranked universities and in leadership positions in the U.S. workforce, Bial said.
Of the Fortune 500 company chief executives, five are black and seven are Latino, she said.
But the solution is not to redirect resources based on race, Bial said.
The United States needs a system of “meritocracy...in which everyone has the chance to succeed based on behavior or conduct worthy of award,” she added.
The Posse Foundation, a nonprofit that partners with higher education institutions to award qualified students with four-year, full-tuition leadership scholarships, emphasizes these values, Bial said.
“Posse doesn’t screen for race.” Bial said, adding the foundation uses broad measures to determine nominees’ merits, such as problem solving and communication skills.
Several Posse Scholars currently studying at Boston University in the audience shared their own stories of growth and education.
Lynette Correa, founder and CEO for Career Coaching 4 Kidz who attended yesterday’s talk, said she found some of the statistics useful for educators like herself, which included information as recent as 2008-2010.
But some audience members said they were disappointed with the talk’s narrow focus.
“The talk only addressed the result of the politics of race and class, but not the causes of the result,” said Ely Dorsey, a physicist at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy. According to him, the talk did not touch on why race is used against the American population to maintain a class system. “Only addressing the fact is [like] putting your finger in the dike.”

Contrary to expectations, the salt intake of Americans has remained consistent over the past five decades, according to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Adam M. Bernstein, a research fellow in nutrition at HSPH, and Walter C. Willett, chair of the HSPH nutrition department, found that Americans consume around 3,700 milligrams of sodium per day—about 50 percent over the recommended amount. The study indicates that sodium intake has remained steady over the past 50 years.
The duo analyzed the results of 38 past studies from 1957 to 2003 that examined the amount of sodium excreted in urine samples over 24 hours to gauge the overall daily intake of sodium.
The researchers said that this method is more reliable than that used by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which tabulates people’s reported intakes instead of performing direct measurements. The survey concluded that the salt intake of Americans increased over the past few decades.
Bernstein and Willett initially expected to see a similar increase in salt intake over time, given that people consume more processed foods than in previous decades. But their recent study indicates the opposite trend.
Bernstein said that one possible explanation for the unexpected result is the greater use of table salt in the past, which balances out the greater consumption of processed foods today.
High sodium intake is linked to an increased risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and even stomach cancer. The American Heart Association and the Institute of Medicine recommend a daily sodium intake of 2,300 milligrams, or the equivalent of one teaspoon of salt per day. Bernstein said that he would recommend 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day for young adults.
He added that he disagrees with the notion that Americans require a certain amount of salt in their diets because some populations around the world—such as those in the Amazon or Japan—have traditionally consumed much lower levels of salt compared to the average American.
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 27, 2010
An earlier version of the Oct. 27 news article "Salt Intake Remains the Same" incorrectly stated that the Harvard researchers analyzed the results of 28 past studies. In fact, they analyzed 38 studies.

The Harvard Farmers’ Market concluded its four-month season in front of the Science Center yesterday with a tour of the 18 stands for students and local community members.
The market, open every Tuesday afternoon since June, was founded in 2007 to promote local healthy foods to the Harvard and Cambridge communities.
“It’s been great, people really get it here,” said Ward’s Berry Farm representative Steven Catanese, who was selling fresh produce including squash and carrots yesterday. “[Community members] like the idea of supporting farms.”
Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ Food Literacy Project Administrator Dara B. Olmsted ’00 led five undergraduates and one Divinity School student through the market, explaining the origins of the local products on the stands.
The squash served in the College’s dining halls all come from Ward’s Berry Farm, Olmsted said.
During the tour, Olmsted shared her personal experiences working at Plato’s Harvest Organic Farm, the only certified organic farm with a stand at the market.
“We harvested potatoes,” Olmsted said. “[It] was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.”
Dale Wentworth, another farmer and a former professional motorcycle racer who co-owns The Warren Farm and Sugarhouse with his wife, introduced visitors to his maple syrup, noting its versatility as a good.
“It’s not in every single product I make,” he said, “but it’s damn close.”
That and other goods were available for sampling and purchase at the booths throughout the market, which boasted vendors including Somerville-based Taza Chocolate, which sold stone-ground organic chocolate, and Flower Folk, an herbal skin care vendor.
Visitors had the opportunity to try Taza’s chocalate and other products for themselves.
For some of the students on the tour, it was their first interaction with the market’s vendors.
Gary D.J. Gerbrandt ’14, a Food Literacy representative, marveled at the array of different locally grown foods.
“I haven’t really explored all the different farms,” Gerbrandt said, “I didn’t know so much food was made so close to Harvard.”
The market will re-open next June.

Hundreds of Planned Parenthood condoms labeled “Proper Attire: Required for Entry” awaited more than 60 students at Ticknor Lounge yesterday for the Campus Contraceptive Campaign Kickoff.
Organized by Harvard Students for Choice, the event marked the start of a nationwide push for free contraceptive access for all women under the new federal health care reform—a goal that would effectively eliminate all co-pays for birth control.
“This would revolutionize access to birth control in this country—not just for people in this room, but for millions of women across the country,” said guest speaker Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
The health care bill adopted last year stipulates coverage of preventive care for women, and a government-appointed panel will rule on the types of preventive care to be covered, according to Richards.
“This is a basic economic, health care, and social justice issue,” she said. “It’s important to weigh the cost of this against the 750,000 pregnant teenagers a year—the highest unintended pregnancy rate in the Western world.”
Although controversy surrounds some areas of reproductive health, Richards said that people on either side of the abortion debate have gotten behind the movement for universal contraceptive access. The investment in providing free birth control, she said, would save the government money that is now spent on unintended pregnancies, pregnant teenagers, and other forms of maternal care.
College students play key roles in advocacy and outreach to the politicians involved in making these decisions, according to Richards.
“Members of Congress are sick of hearing from me, but they’re very interested in what young people have to say,” she said.
“This room could start the campaign amongst colleges nationwide if the group of you gathered together here worked to figure out the campaign on campus and beyond,” said Gina Glantz, a former fellow at the Institute of Politics and chair of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.
Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, a member of the Students for Choice board, said that Harvard students are already working to get the movement off the ground.
“It’s up to us to use our position of privilege as students at Harvard, a university with so many resources, to stand up for our reproductive rights, as well as the rights and health of women who aren’t in a position to advocate for themselves,” she said.
Members of SFC will accompany the Harvard Democrats to campaign in New Hampshire over the weekend. In addition to the Dems, groups including Peer Contraceptive Counselors and Latinas Unidas have already signed on, and SFC plans to reach out to other organizations on campus and nationwide to take part.
“This is for anyone interested in working on shaping a big campaign that could have national significance” Reis-Dennis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stacy L. Rush had all the makings of a typical Harvard student. She enjoyed taking biology courses and spending time at Harvard Hillel. She had even founded an officially recognized student organization. Yet when she e-mailed Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Lecturer Andrew Berry with a question about her coursework, he was perplexed.
Upon receiving the student’s e-mail, Berry looked her up on Harvard College Facebook and was surprised to find she was unlisted.
“Who are you?” he asked, bewildered, when she walked into class the next day. Laughing, Rush explained that she was a Visiting Undergraduate Student.
Rush and her fellow VUS (pronounced “vuzz” by those in the know) come to Harvard from universities around the world to study for a semester or a year. Though the VUS become involved in most aspects of Harvard life, the existence of this program remains unknown to many at the University and nearly unadvertised outside of Harvard.
GOING ABROAD—TO HARVARD
The Visiting Undergraduate Student Program allows undergraduates from any university in the world to apply to attend Harvard for one or two semesters.
Many of those who participate in this program are international students. Others come from small liberal arts schools in the U.S., and a few come from Harvard’s peer institutions—last year, one visiting student hailed from Princeton and another from Brown.
The students list a variety of reasons for coming to Harvard, but most center on academics. According to Sarah R. Cole, a lecturer on History and Literature who serves as the advising coordinator for the VUS Program, most of the international students major in economics in their home countries and hope to gain an American perspective on the field. The domestic students, she said, tend to be math or science concentrators who feel they have exhausted the course offerings in their subjects at their colleges.
Jiajia Wang, who came from Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain to participate in the VUS Program in 2009, said that she was planning to apply to graduate programs in economics in the U.S. and wanted a preview of the American educational system.
Damie Park said she thought that Harvard would offer her more opportunities in her field of study—Women, Gender, and Sexuality—than Ewha Womans University in Korea where she was an undergraduate. Hoping to transfer to Harvard in 2008, she learned that transfer admissions had been suspended—Harvard did not accept any transfer students in 2008 and 2009—but that she could spend a year at Harvard as a VUS.
For Grant A. Justin, the VUS Program offered him “a second chance,” he said. A self-described “terrible student in high school,” he cleaned up his grades while attending the University of Oregon for a year and Montana State University for two years. Adding a year at Harvard to his resume before his final year at MSU, he said, “definitely looks good.”
The application process for visiting students is similar to the regular admissions process, but it differs in several significant ways. First, VUS can enter Harvard in either the fall or spring semesters, so applications are evaluated twice each year.
Rather than focusing on personal characteristics or experiences, the essay portion of the application asks them to “Be as specific as you can regarding your academic interests and the curriculum you expect to follow.”
And though they do have the opportunity to indulge in shopping week once they arrive on campus, prospective VUS must list in their applications the four courses that they might enroll in during their first term at Harvard.
The number of VUS applications and the admissions rate for the program contrast starkly with the Harvard admissions norm. Whereas 614 students applied for transfer admission and over 30,000 sought regular admission in fall 2010, just 47 applied for the VUS Program. Of those applicants, 32 were admitted, and 30 decided to attend—21 are here for just the fall semester, and 9 will stay for the full year.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the program receives a low number of applicants because the admissions office does not promote it heavily. Though there is a page on the admissions website about the program and the admissions office prints an informational card about it, Fitzsimmons said that his office does not “recruit” VUS applicants as it does for degree candidates.
“Maybe half of the people I talk to [at Harvard] have never heard of it,” Justin said. “I think if it was well known a lot of people would apply.”
HARVARD THROUGH THEIR EYES
As visitors to Harvard from varied backgrounds, VUS have unique perspectives on life at Harvard.
Coming from York University, a “commuter school” in Ontario, Canada, Rush said that “Harvard has a lot of school spirit.”
Leon Zabel, who is spending the current semester as a VUS, said that at his school in Germany, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, “social life is not centered at the university. We don’t have a campus at all, just some buildings right in the city.”
Wang expressed a similar sentiment, saying that Harvard has “a lot of student life that we don’t have so much in Spain. We just go to classes, lectures. We may have some student organizations, but people are not so active—and not, I would say, so power-hungry, wanting to be president.”
“I was mystified a little bit at Harvard,” Wang added. “I thought the people would be so amazing and myself would be so, so small. I arrived there and I actually felt, yes, these people are so hardworking—and so lost. They have to go to therapy...this is not normal. We should be competitive, but in a sane way.”
Some VUS also pointed out academic differences between their home universities and Harvard. Park said that in Korea her classes were mainly large lectures with no opportunity for discussion; she enjoyed the chance to participate in sections at Harvard. Wang praised the lower requirements towards earning a degree in the U.S., saying she was surprised that an American undergraduate could complete a concentration by taking around 12 courses in a field.
The VUS have become involved in a wide variety of extracurricular activities during their time at Harvard, ranging from Model United Nations to the Harvard-Radcliffe Chorus to the Harvard Financial Analysts Club. Justin is currently working in a biology lab and Zabel is rowing with the freshman crew team, although he’ll be back in Germany by the time they have their first competitive meet in the spring. Park, who spent a spring semester and then a fall semester at Harvard, participated in the Harvard-Radcliffe Women’s Leadership Project’s annual conference during the summer break. Rush even left her mark on Harvard by co-founding the Quidditch team.
PAYING A VISIT
Despite their immersion in most academic and extracurricular facets of Harvard, VUS are not included in one important area of undergraduate life: the House system.
On-campus housing is not offered to any of the VUS. Cole explained that, “There hasn’t been room to house all the VUS in Harvard housing, so as a matter of fairness we ask them all to live off campus.”
She acknowledged that this is a source of frustration to most VUS. “Their one wish is that there could be on-campus housing, because that’s such an important Harvard experience,” she said.
Aside from Justin (who said he meets Harvard students through his brother, a current Harvard sophomore), all of the VUS interviewed for this story expressed a strong desire to have the social experience of living in a House.
Another concern for some VUS is the cost of the program. Visiting students are not offered financial aid and thus must pay the full rate of $17,488 per semester to take four courses, in addition to the cost of off-campus housing.
Most students said that their semester or year at Harvard carried a far heftier price tag than their home universities. Zabel pays 500 euros (about $700) per semester, which he said is the maximum that a public university can charge students in Germany. In Montana, Justin spends just over $6,000 per year in tuition; he said he was “surprised” to learn that Harvard does not offer financial aid to visiting students, though he said he would not have applied for aid regardless.
“Frankly speaking, it adds like one more zero” to her usual tuition in Korea, Park said. “It was a little bit burdensome...personally, I think it was worth it. I learned a lot from that one year at Harvard.”

Jeannie Suk, a law professor who is best known for her work on family and fashion law, has recently become the first tenured Asian-American woman at Harvard Law School.
The faculty voted to grant tenure on Oct. 14 and notified Suk later that afternoon while she was observing her five-year-old son’s music class, she said.
Suk—who currently teaches courses on criminal law and on performing arts and the law—joined the Law School faculty in 2006, having graduated from the Law School herself only four years earlier.
When Suk was originally appointed, she was only the second woman of color to join the faculty after Law School Professor Lani Guinier ’71.
“It was a proud and joyful moment for me,” Guinier said, who added that she is now “overjoyed” to have Suk as a colleague.
Suk said that students often comment that it affects them positively to be taught by a successful female professor.
“I’m used to being one of the few women [at the Law School],” Suk wrote in an e-mail. “But I’ve been a professor under two women deans. It’s hard to say why, but personally I am not that aware of my life as a professor having been more difficult because of being a woman on a mostly male faculty.”
When Guinier first met Suk in 1999, Suk was a first-year student at the Law School interviewing for a research assistant position with Guinier.
Suk “wrote the most brilliant response I could imagine,” Guinier said. “She knocked my socks off with her intellect and insight.”
Last year, Suk entered the spotlight in the fashion world after she co-authored an article in the Stanford Law Review arguing that American fashion designers should have their designs protected by law against imitations or knock-offs.
Shortly thereafter, New York Senator Charles E. Schumer ’71 recruited Suk to assist in crafting legislation that would give copyright protection to fashion designs.
Suk—who immigrated to the United States from Seoul, Korea as a child—was also awarded a 2009 Guggenheim Fellowship to research the legal construction of trauma.
She has served as a law clerk to Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court and to Judge Harry T. Edwards on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Suk also published a book last year entitled “At Home in the Law: How the Domestic Violence Revolution is Transforming Privacy,” which received the Herbert Jacob Prize by the Law and Society Association.
She has also written articles for publications that include the Yale Law Journal, the Stanford Law Review, and the Columbia Law Review.

Harvard officials fielded questions on the College’s drug, alcohol, and amnesty policies during a panel attended by an audience of about 20 undergraduates yesterday evening.
The talk—organized by the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors—included a warning against the dangers of the popular alcoholic drink Four Loko and a frank discussion about marijuana and underage drinking on campus.
The chief of the Harvard University Police Department, College administrators, and a Harvard University Health Services medical director worked to reassure the audience that the College prioritizes the safety and well-being of undergraduates.
“How many people here know anybody we’ve arrested for underage drinking?” HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley asked the audience.
When no one raised their hand, Riley said, “In the 15 years I’ve been here, we’ve never done it.”
“For a student to get arrested by us, they have to work really hard,” he added.
John “Jay” L. Ellison, secretary of the Administrative Board—the College’s primary disciplinary body—recounted one incident when he, a Cambridge Police Department officer, and a HUPD officer encountered a student passed out under a parked vehicle.
“A police officer asked him for an ID and he pulled out a bag of pot,” Ellison said.
The officer proceeded to empty the marijuana into a nearby patch of grass. The student was not arrested, nor was he asked to meet with the Ad Board, Ellison said. Instead, he received medical care.
When students are brought to UHS, their follow-up tends to consist of a meeting with their resident dean and medical consultations, which Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson called “a philosophical decision that Harvard has made.”
“What research tells us is that one of the most effective ways to intervene is a follow-up consultation, and we’re treating it like what it is: a medical issue,” Nelson said.
Harvard officials also expressed concern over a new popular 24-ounce drink called Four Loko. Gregory Johnson, medical director for the Stillman Infirmary and after-hours/urgent care, said the drink was troubling because of the combination of stimulants with concentrated amounts of alcohol.
“It’s a real bad brew,” he said. “Badness in a can.”

American conservative political writer William Kristol ’73 discussed the new era of politics, former Vice Presidential candidate Sarah L. Palin, and the changes that will result from the midterm elections last night at an event called “Kristol Clear” before a full Kirkland Junior Common Room.
The event—hosted by Conversations with Kirkland, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Harvard Salient—focused on the current state of politics for the Republican party.
“We’re now in an era where we continue to be very volatile, very fluid, very dramatic,” Kristol said of politics today.
From former U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan’s election in 1980 to former President George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004, Kristol described the American political system as generally conservative, characterizing even former Democratic President Bill Clinton as a moderate.
“In the last three elections, we will have had three change elections in a row; three elections with dramatic results and dramatic changes,” Kristol said.
Kristol predicted that after the upcoming midterm election occurring next Tuesday, current President Barack H. Obama will shift his stance to the right and the Republican party will gain traction.
“I think Obama will at least try to appear to be more of a fiscal conservative,” Kristol said. “My slightly contrarian view is that we will have more bipartisanship. I don’t think that Obama is such an ideologue that he will decide he doesn’t want to get anything done for two years.”
The dialogue and subsequent question and answer session were also littered with jokes about the Democratic party and cutting funding to National Public Radio.
“I have to indulge myself and ask the Sarah Palin question,” said Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11. “Is the woman running for president?”
“I really don’t know if she’ll run,” Kristol responded. “If you forced me to bet, I’d say yes. Why not take a shot?”
But he wasn’t certain about whether she would be a competitive candidate.
“Fairly or unfairly, she’s picked up a lot of baggage,” Kristol added.
When asked whether the Republican failure to address climate change would negatively affect the party, Kristol said that Americans are currently more focused on the economy.
“Honestly, I’d be willing to sacrifice some more climate change to get a few million more people out of poverty in India and China,” he said.

Thomas E. Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, urged Harvard Law School students to pursue careers in public service, pointing to his own work in civil rights over the past year.
Speaking to a crowd of 40 students in Austin Hall yesterday, Perez, who graduated from Harvard Law in 1987, stressed the government’s role in enforcing civil rights legislation.
Perez opened the talk, sponsored by the school’s Office of Public Interest Advising, by challenging the notion that America has moved beyond the civil rights problems of the past.
“I wish we had entered a post-racial America,” Perez said. “I wish we could shut down the Civil Rights Division and put up a big ‘Mission Accomplished’ sign.”
Perez pointed to recent cases his division has handled, including attacks on African Americans on the night of the 2008 presidential election and schools’ refusal to address the bullying of gay students.
In what some attendees said was one of Perez’ most interesting examples of his division’s work, Perez addressed the Arizona immigration law that the Department of Justice successfully blocked earlier this year.
“Under federal law, there is only one quarterback in immigration law,” said Perez, explaining the government’s argument against it.
Assistant Dean for Public Service Alexa Shabecoff said she was pleased with the discussion’s broader message.
“Sometimes students think there aren’t many issues left to work on. This reminded them of everything that’s left,” she said.
The attorney, who has spent his entire career as a public servant, said while the financial compensation in the public sector is not as appealing as in the private sector, he has never had a job he did not love.
To close, Perez assigned homework for his attendees: write obituaries to identify what they would want their legacies to be.
“What do you think your purpose on this planet is?” asked Perez, challenging students to choose a career in public service.

After the Harvard women’s soccer team lost two of its first four Ivy League matches, the team’s chances for a third-straight league crown looked bleak. The squad’s 2-1 overtime loss to non-league opponent Siena on Oct. 19 seemed to indicate that the Crimson was headed in the wrong direction.
That’s when Melanie Baskind took things into her own hands.
The junior had the best game of her collegiate career Saturday at Princeton, scoring two goals and adding two assists in Harvard’s 4-0 thrashing of the Tigers. Her six points were a career high.
“She was in the zone,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “She was just seeing the ball, she was making great runs, [and] she was receiving it with good vision and composure. It was a fantastic performance.”
Prior to the Princeton contest, Baskind had been in a slump, failing to tally a point in the previous four matches.
The Quincy House resident turned that drought into merely a memory less than 20 minutes into the match. After fighting her way through the Tigers’ defense, Baskind beat the goalie in a one-on-one faceoff.
“She just committed to score,” co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh said of the goal. “I guess what was so special about her play was she didn’t let up.”
With the visitors only leading by one goal midway through the match though, Baskind took her play to an even higher level the next half.
About 16 minutes into the second period, Sheeleigh knocked in a blocked Baskind shot that had slipped away from Princeton’s goalie.
Within the next six minutes, Baskind added another goal of her own, and sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro scored Harvard’s fourth goal of the game after corralling another deflected Baskind shot and firing the ball into the back of the net.
The Tigers just couldn’t handle the Baskind blitzkrieg.
In total, the junior took six shots. All six were on goal, and four directly led to Crimson scores.
“Mel was unbelievable on Saturday,” Sheeleigh said. “She couldn’t have been any more dynamic, [and] she made stuff happen for us. She was basically awesome.”
“[Baskind] was responding to our team not doing that well on Tuesday [against Siena], and [she] just [said], ‘This is it,’” Leone added. “And we played with that kind of [attitude], and Mel led the way on that.”
For her efforts, she earned Ivy League Player of the Week honors for the second time this season.
It seems that the only person who wasn’t impressed by Baskind’s performance was the standout herself.
“There’s one person that gets the stats at the end of the game…[but] it’s someone else who’s making runs to make movement or following up shots,” Baskind said. “It really was just a reflection of how everyone played, being able to put in four goals [Saturday] night.”
The Framingham, Mass. native continued her high level of play against Quinnipiac on Monday night. Though she failed to find the back of the net, her four shots on goal were twice the amount of anyone else on the team.
Baskind has long been a force on the offensive front. With her two goals against Princeton, she ran her year total to seven, tying her for the team lead with Sheeleigh.
“She has awesome foot skills, and she works hard every single game,” Sheeleigh said. “She just makes things happen defensively [and] offensively.”
While Baskind is a powerhouse on the field, she exerts a strong presence off of it as well.
“Everybody loves her,” Leone said. “She’s just got an ability to connect with every single player on the team.”
The squad has two matches with Ancient Eight opponents remaining, including a bout at Dartmouth this Saturday. If the team wants to capture the league title once more, the contest against the Big Green is a must-win.
“All that really matters is that we beat Dartmouth on Saturday,” senior co-captain Gina Wideroff said.
As the team looks ahead, it can certainly build off of its performance Saturday against Princeton.
“It was a good night for me, [and] it was a good night for the team,” Baskind said. “It’s time to take that positive energy into what’s next.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As if junior Pili Mayora wasn’t already distinct by being one of the few international students and athletes from Argentina, the field hockey athlete has another unique experience that makes her stand out even more: she joined circus school in Buenos Aires before coming to Harvard.
When Mayora graduated from high school in November of 2007, she was looking for something that would keep her busy until attending Harvard in the fall. Due to a different school calendar that runs from March to November in Argentina, Mayora had nine months of free time before coming to college. And with those nine months, she did what any recent high school graduate would do: she decided to go to circus school.
Students in America have decided to take unique gap year experiences before, but usually not something like this. Yet, this idea is not as crazy as it might sound at first. The trend of attending circus school has actually been growing in Argentina in recent years.
“The idea of attending circus school is becoming culturally important in Buenos Aires,” Mayora explains. “Actresses [in Argentina] recently started doing it for fun. They appear on TV and then teenagers say, ‘I want to do that.’”
And when Mayora was done juggling both school and field hockey, she viewed it as the perfect opportunity to jump on the bandwagon. She leaped at the chance to go to “El Coreto” Circus School, which focuses on teaching the arts of the circus in Buenos Aires. She attended the basic training program, in which performers learn all of the general circus skills before moving on to professional school for three years.
“The major [motivation to go to circus school] was when the first Cirque du Soleil came to Buenos Aires and I went to one of their shows my junior year [in high school],” Mayora says. “I just thought it would be really cool to do.”
Her family and friends were surprised at first that Mayora decided to attend circus school, but eventually came around to the idea.
“My friends were just like, ‘Oh Pili, you would do this’,” Mayora laughs. “They saw it as this really cool and eccentric thing to do.”
“My first reaction was that we were surprised because she was always the mathematics girl in high school, and it was a very different activity,” her father, Armando Mayora says. “When we saw that she was happy, we were happy for her also.”
Even though Mayora only attended for nine months, she learned many things kids wish they could do when they watch a circus performance for the first time. She learned to use the trapeze and tightrope. She learned acrobatic techniques and tricks on the trampoline. She learned how to use the rings and harnesses. But the most important thing she learned was the quintessential part of any circus performer’s routine: she learned how to juggle.
“I really liked juggling the most, even though it was not my strongest,” Mayora says. “I also liked silk and trapeze a lot, but they were really hard. [The skills are] like riding a bike though: once you learn, you never forget.”
The skills that Mayora developed turned out to pay dividends in her development as a better field hockey player.
“I think Pili has definitely improved,” sophomore Emma Keller says. “Her conditioning has gotten better…Pili is super-skilled and the girl has tricks.”
“[Circus conditioning] has made my core super strong,” Mayora noted. “We had an hour of conditioning a day and did a lot of abdominal work. My core was really tight and developed afterward. In field hockey, because you’re bending down all the time, you need to have that strong core. The style in Argentina is based more on individual skill and creativity, while in the U.S., it is more about strength and fitness.”
After completing her nine months of training, Mayora can either go back for more basic training or move on to professional school for three years.
“I would definitely do it again,” Mayora said. “I was thinking of maybe doing basic training for another year and then going to professional circus school. Everyone was really cool there and it’s just a very different scene from real life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard students, we’re often spoiled by the history around us. We know many of the basic facts—the date of incorporation and the names of at least a few of the presidents that came here—but often not much more.
At the same time, we give Harvard’s monuments and plaques about the same attention as we give disruptive Hahvahd tour groups when we’re walking from the Science Center to Sever: as little as possible. I know from walking by the same tour every Tuesday and Thursday at 11 that Matt Damon lived in Matthews.
I cannot say that I’m at all above this lack of attention. Leaving Ec 10 lecture in Sanders Theater, I paid more attention to the fact that one of the names on the wall—Benjamin Franklin Peirce—is almost identical to the legal name of Hawkeye, the protagonist from M*A*S*H, before I thought about the building’s original purpose as a Civil War memorial.
This observation, for one, demonstrates my affinity to 1970’s sitcoms. But it also shows how even the most interesting landmarks become banal when they become familiar. It’s why we never go to museums in our own hometowns.
As the adage goes, you can learn a lot by looking. We’re surrounded by historical markers in the Yard, the Square and our Houses.
The ones we might ignore the most are those in Allston. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that we rarely wander purposelessly into the athletic complex.  The people who take the time to admire the history are the same ones who photograph squirrels and touch John Harvard’s foot.
Like in Memorial Church and Sanders Theater, many of the monuments are war memorials—not surprising, given that formal (but little-used) name of the whole complex is Soldiers Field.
Without exploring beyond the standard path to Harvard Stadium, you can find tucked-away monuments that provide some insight into Harvard and Boston history.
The first, on the right after walking through the gates, is a memorial to five men: two are Lowells, all have Boston Brahmin-ish names. The obelisk doesn’t list when or where these men died, or why just these five were chosen.
Ordinarily, Lowell means three things—the house, the lecture hall, and frustration for freshman who show up at the wrong one for section. But the five men, including both Lowells, were Civil War casualties. Soldiers Field, in fact, is named for them. When Henry Lee Hugginson, another Union soldier, donated over 30 acres to Harvard, he did so in honor of these five friends from college who died fighting for the North.
Walking toward the stadium, on the left, is a plaque to “Tack” Hardwick ’15. As the memorial reads, Hardwick was a three sport varsity athlete, though it doesn’t mention his involvement in World War I as a captain in the army.
Nor does it mention (perhaps more importantly to Bostonians today) his involvement in building the Boston Garden, home of the Bruins from 1928 to 1995 and of the Celtics from 1946 to 1995.
Harvard Stadium itself is more significant than most people realize, both athletically and architecturally. A marker on the visitor’s side of the stadium gives a brief history. A gift from the Class of 1879 in 1903, Harvard Stadium was both the first “massive structure of reinforced concrete in the world” and the first permanent stadium for American college athletics.
The age and throwback Romanesque architecture, to be sure, adds a certain intangible Harvard gravitas to even the most insignificant of games. And it probably explains the lack of bathrooms and bleachers that are about as comfortable as a middle seat between two sumo wrestlers.
The last memorial on the way in is a three-part plaque to Percy D. Haughton. The College Football Hall of Famer coached Harvard football—the team trained on his private island when he did—and was at one time a part owner of the Boston Braves.
So next time you’re on your way to a football game, check out the monuments. It’s a reminder that Harvard played a critical role in the early development of big-time sports.
But more importantly, were it not for some of these men, Harvard Stadium and Soldiers Field wouldn’t be there in the first place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the women’s ice hockey team opening its season at home on Friday against Yale, the Back Page gives you an opportunity to meet co-captain Kate Buesser, the team’s scoring leader as well as an All-ECAC and All-Ivy first team selection. In this exclusive interview, Buesser reveals her pre-game routine that includes Celine Dion, her embarrassing fall during practice, why she considers herself like Yale, and her love for a Patriots player. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference. 
Name: Kate Buesser
Year: 2011
Stats: In three seasons, Buesser has played in all of her team’s 99 games, scoring 28 goals and 38 assists. Last season, Buesser played in 33 games, racking up 16 goals, 24 assists and 119 shots, all team highs. 
Now, to the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal.
I will usually have the standard two pieces of grilled chicken (sometimes with BBQ sauce, other times with a little A1 on the side), a generous portion of pasta with sauce, and some veggies or yogurt with fruit. I finish out the meal with a cup of water and a little Diet Coke for some caffeine.
2. Songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Celine Dion "I'm Alive" and a whole lotta techno and mashups.
3. Favorite team to play against and why.
I love playing against UNH at the Whittemore Center because when I was younger I used to go and watch the women play. UNH is usually in the top 10 teams in the nation as well, so we can be guaranteed a good game.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
We used to have a blow-up bounce-back (the toy that you can punch to the ground and it comes back up at you) in our locker room and depending on which team we were playing we would post their seal on it. The night we were playing Brown, our coach came in to give the "serious" pre-game talk and without saying a word she round-about kicked the bounce-back into one of our players. I'm pretty sure none of us heard a word she said after that because we were dying laughing.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the ice.
We were playing a game in practice where one player has to go around a net to have a one-on-one breakaway against the goalie. I attempted to go around the net...and I say ATTEMPTED because I cut my turn a bit too close. I ended up slamming myself full speed into the side of the net with nobody around me, resulting in one of the biggest yard sale falls of my life.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I regret to admit that I play most like the mascot of our rivals in New Haven...a bulldog. I am extremely physical on our forechecks and in front of our offensive net. I have an aggressive style of play that aims to wear down our opponents.
7. The most ridiculous thing you've heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
I honestly can't remember where we were playing but one of the comments was directed at one of our taller defensemen (who we affectionately call FFD's). She had been playing very aggressively and had been knocking down a ton of their players, eventually getting a checking penalty for one of the plays. As she was skating towards the penalty box, I heard one of the fans yell, "Get off the ice Ray Lewis!" I'm not sure if it was a compliment or an insult but regardless we died laughing on the bench.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I think I would like to try fencing. I saw the national championships that were at Harvard last year and was amazed at the skill of the sport. To be honest, I had no idea of any of the rules but they looked awesome in their get-ups! Plus, who doesn't want to practice their sword fighting skills? (Or is it sabre skills?)
9. Position you'd play in Quidditch.
I would absolutely be a Chaser. I love the passing aspect of these players. 
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be?
There are so many to choose from...but if I had to only go with one it would be Wes Welker. I am a huge football fan in general but I love, love, love the Patriots and he is such an integral part of the team's success. I am also very impressed at how he came back from such a devastating injury last year to be extremely effective again in the first five games of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s used to being at the top of plenty of lists, and every once in a while so are its athletes. And with a series of impressive performances the past few weeks, Gino Gordon has become one of those athletes.
Gordon, the COOP Athlete of the Week and Ivy League co-Offensive Player of Week, is ranked number two in the nation in yards-per-carry (7.8). That mark is also far and above the highest in the Ivy League, followed in second by fellow Crimson running back Treavor Scales (6.4 ypc), who is also ranked 10th nationally.
Gordon’s stats were boosted by his play in this weekend’s 45-28 win over Princeton. He rushed for a career-high 204 yards on 20 carries and a 26-yard touchdown. Gordon also had four receptions off returning quarterbacks Andrew Hatch and Collier Winters.
Gordon has run for no less than 100 yards in each of Harvard’s last four games to jump to fourth on the Crimson’s all-time list with 2,295 career yards.

February of 2011 may seem far away, but the College Events Board wants you to start thinking about “Harvard Thinks Big,” the second edition. “Harvard Thinks Big” consists of an all-star team of professors from diverse backgrounds, each delivering a 10-minute speech about topics in his/her field of expertise. The first annual “Harvard Thinks Big” took place this past February in Sanders Theatre, filling the venue to capacity after hundreds more were turned away.
Long before the event takes place again, CEB is already encouraging to nominate potential speakers for “Harvard Thinks Big 2.” Students can nominate as many speakers as they choose and Professors and Lecturers from any Harvard school are eligible. Those who are interested in helping organizing “Harvard Thinks Big” and other campus-wide events are encouraged to run for the College Event Board House Rep position.
Some of the speakers last year included CS50 Professor David J. Malan ’99, who shared his own story of how he began as a Government concentrator only to discover Computer Science. HKS lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy delivered a controversial speech about the future of protest and psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert discussed why global warming has not elicited a stronger response.

According to Respectably French’s latest video, Stephen Colbert has “deprived the entire Harvard community of our [N. Gregory] Mankiw.” The video, which features the Ec. 10 professor, is a response to a comment Colbert made (starting at 2:59) mocking Mankiw’s recent New York Times column on taxes and their effect on his incentive to work.
Mankiw first reacted with amusement to the Colbert comments, posting on his blog, “I find Stephen Colbert funny, even when it’s at my expense." He also posted Respectably French's video, in which he is jokingly titled an “Ex Harvard Economics Professor.”
Of course, this whole story revolves around tax policy, so if you are looking for more information, we've got it. The guy who currently holds the job Mankiw used to have (Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers) has put out a video where he discusses his perspective.

As The Crimson reported two weeks ago, a Sigma Chi party, which was billed as “Conquistabros and Navajos” received some criticism from some students on campus. Students were encouraged to dress up “as anything related to exploration in America, e.g. Columbus, pilgrims, conquistadors, Native Americans and cowboys/girls” for the party which took place over the Columbus Day weekend.
While initial negative reactions to the festivities were at first limited to students on campus, it has now sparked some outrage outside of the Harvard community.
Adrienne K., a Cherokee graduate student in the Boston area, posted an e-mail signed “The Members of Sigma Chi” on her blog Native Appropriations.
“The brothers of Sigma Chi invite you to our Columbus Day party this Friday: Conquistabros and Navajos. Start off the long weekend right with one of our best parties of the year. The theme is lighthearted and flexible,” the e-mail reads in part.
The claim that “the theme is lighthearted” seems to have struck a nerve with Adrienne K. “First of all, lighthearted?! You're calling the genocide of millions of Native peoples lighthearted? What if we re-wrote their invitation...to a new party called ‘Jew-bros and Nazi-hos’?” she wrote.
Another blog also criticized the party’s theme.
“All in all, it seems like a stupid idea, even if we don't know the details. If we did know the details, I'm sure it would seem much worse,” commented Newspaper Rock, a blog “where Native America meets pop culture.”
Sigma Chi has issued a formal apology, calling the theme “insensitive” and an “error of judgment.” The fraternity has pledged to donate the proceeds from their annual food drive to the Native American Heritage Association “to help rectify, in a small way, the ongoing pervasive deprivation and hunger on our nation's reservations.”
Here’s Sigma Chi’s full apology, addressed to members of the Harvard community:
“We would like to apologize for the theme of the party that we recently held. It was insensitive and hurtful, especially for the Native American members of our community. We are deeply sorry for the offense our actions have caused.
As a group that strives to be inclusive, and embraces members of numerous ethnic backgrounds and nationalities, including Native Americans, we recognize that this was a serious error of judgment on our part, and we expect better of ourselves. We have taken steps to increase oversight over future chapter activities to prevent offensive mistakes like this one. You have our promise that we will not allow it to happen again.
The chapter has decided to donate the proceeds from our annual food drive to the Native American Heritage Association to help rectify, in a small way, the ongoing pervasive deprivation and hunger on our nation's reservations.  Again, we are deeply sorry for the lack of judgment.
Sincerely,
The Members of Sigma Chi at Harvard”
