After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Captain Christina Cornelius and junior hitter Grace Roberts Burbank both had standout performances as Harvard women’s volleyball picked up a weekend sweep, defeating Princeton and Pennto remain undefeated at home. Cornelius had double-digit kills for the seventh time this season and led the team with 12 kills against a vaunted Tigers team that is consistently one of the top contenders in the Ivy League. The Los Angeles, Calif., native only tallied one error en route to a season-high attack percentage of .524. Burbank also had double-digit kills against Princeton after a phenomenal outing against the Quakers in which she had 13 kills.
After suffering three successive losses coming into this past weekend, the Crimson had a strong showing in its past two games, spearheaded by Cornelius and Burbank. A dominant victory against Penn on Friday winning in straight sets (25-19, 25-21, 25-19) had Harvard coming into its game against the Tigers on Saturday confident and motivated for a win. Princeton had yet to lose a conference game and had a strong record of 11-4. However, the underdog Crimson was not intimidated by Princeton’s attacking prowess, and exploited the visitors’ errors throughout the game. After a defensive start, Harvard won the first set and capitalized on Princeton’s errors. During the next two sets, clutch play and strong defense allowed the Crimson to pull away and win in straight sets (25-20, 25-19, 25-23). Harvard’s victory against the Tigers demonstrates that it has the capability to compete with the best in the league and is a promising indicator that the team can close out the season with a strong record.
The leadership and clutch play of Cornelius propelled the Crimson to its dominant performance this weekend. At the end of the game-clinching set against Princeton, Cornelius had three kills and was critical in winning the set and the match. She has had consistently strong games throughout the season and acts as a stabilizing force for the team. Burbank has also been integral to the team’s recent string of success. Without her in the beginning of the season, the team was 2-4, and since her return to the lineup, the team has been 5-3 with six double-digit kill performances from the junior. After a weekend that has changed the momentum of the season, the women’s volleyball team will be a force to reckon for the rest of the Ancient Eight if it keeps up this level of play.
Next week, Harvard will go on the road against Brown and Yale where it will look to build off its stellar games this past weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a rocky last few weeks against Ivy League opponents, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-7, 2-3 Ivy) was able to turn the tides this weekend and pull off back-to-back sweeps.
These unanticipated wins came against another pair of Ancient Eight rivals. On Friday, the Crimson took down the Pennsylvania Quakers (4-11, 0-4), keeping Penn from attaining its first conference win. Harvard faced a much fiercer opponent at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday, but a strong offensive effort by the Crimson was more than enough to sweep the conference-leading Princeton Tigers (11-5, 4-1).
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 0
A standout game by captain Christina Cornelius was the highlight of Harvard’s victory against the Tigers on Saturday. The senior connected on 12 kills, leading the team in that category. Close behind was junior hitter Grace Roberts Burbank, who amassed 10 kills over the course of the game.
The first match began as a defensive brawl between the two teams, as neither squad seemed to be able to pull away from the other. However, once both teams were tied at eight, the Crimson offense started on a hot streak, denying the Tigers any chance of taking back their early-game lead.
“Going into Princeton, we knew it was going to be a challenge, but I think every person on our team believed that we could handle it,” senior attacker Jocelyn Meyer said. “By the time we finished that first match, it was such a great feeling to see that we had come together as a team to overcome any the obstacles we had faced in the past weeks.”
For Harvard, the latter two matches were defined by momentum. Though the Crimson’s 8-3 lead at the start of the second match was threatened by a 3-0 run by the Tigers, the Harvard defense came alive and kept Princeton to 19 points. The Crimson sealed the deal with a game-changing kill from freshman Jaimie Rao.
“All of our freshmen, at different times, have stepped in and contributed some key moments to our team,” Meyer said. “[Rao has] seen the court a couple times this year, but this was her first opportunity to really contribute her all…. It really didn’t show that she was a freshman on the court.”
Offensive pressure from the Tigers during the third match put Harvard’s chance of securing a sweep in jeopardy, but a kill streak by Cornelius, coupled with a continued strong defensive performance by the Crimson, allowed Harvard to clinch the match, the game, and the sweep.
“In practice, instead of thinking, ‘Oh it’s just practice,’ I am going to play with the mentality that I would play with in a game,” Cornelius said. “[We’re] making sure that we are intentional about every pass, every set, every hit that we do.”
This weekend’s games proved that this mentality has paid off for the Crimson. The Crimson’s win on Saturday gave Princeton its first conference loss this season, resulting in a three-way tie for first in the league between the Tigers, the Yale Bulldogs (10-4, 4-1), and the Cornell Big Red (9-6, 4-1).
HARVARD 3, PENNSYLVANIA 0
Harvard’s first match against Penn began in gridlock, with neither team appearing to have a strong advantage over the other. However, the intense point-for-point duel between the Crimson and the Quakers was ended with a powerful kill from Roberts Burbank, who paved the way for a Harvard hot streak. Two kills by Rao toward the backend of the game secured victory for the Crimson.
“In other weekends, when we got stuck in rotation or were going point-to-point with other teams, we shut down a little bit,” Meyer said. “But this weekend, we were able to turn that around, stay confident, and really trust our training.”
The theme of gridlock persisted into the next two sets, as the cutthroat competition between Harvard and Penn only got closer. Both teams traded the lead throughout the entirety of the set, with the Crimson coming out on top after strong offensive pressure from the backend.
However, the offensive battle between the two teams quickly turned to a defensive brawl during the third match, making for yet another tight game. The scoreboard displayed a tied match a total of nine times, resulting a heart-pounding 17-17 tie between the two teams at the tail end of the set.
Blocking and ball-handling errors by the Quakers provided Harvard with the perfect opportunity to take the match, an opportunity that Meyer was sure to take. Two kills by the Springboro, Ohio, native clinched the game for the Crimson, handing Harvard its first conference win of the year.
“I think we really thrived while embracing [this weekend’s] challenges,” Meyer said. “By the time we finished up the weekend, it was such a great feeling to see that we had come together as a team and prove to ourselves that anything really can happen in the Ivy League.”
The Crimson’s Ancient Eight battles will continue next week as the team heads south of the Massachusetts border to take on Yale and the Brown Bears (8-7, 1-4).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Junior forward Maddie Earle collected three of the four goals Harvard scored this weekend as the field hockey team extended its win streak to eight games, which ties the program record set in 2016. Earle and the No. 11 Crimson squad defeated Brown and Boston University over the weekend to move to an 11-1 overall record on the season.
“We played how we wanted to play,” Earle said. “We stuck to the plan and really executed and trusted the process.”
HARVARD 2, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 0
On Sunday, Harvard (11-1, 3-0 Ivy League) faced off against the 23rd-ranked Boston University (7-5, 3-0 Patriot League). Throughout the first half, the Crimson was unable to find the back of the board even with five shots on goal.
It took 24 minutes after the break for Earle to connect off a Terrier turnover, scoring her seventh goal in the last six games. Only three minutes later, freshman midfielder and forward Rachel Greenwood scored her second career goal.
Earle, who now has nine goals and two assists this season, attributed her offensive explosion throughout the Crimson’s win streak to her teammates.
“We have some fantastic players in the midfield, like Tessel [Huibregtsen], Bente [van Vlijmen], Rachel [Greenwood], who make me look fantastic up front,” Earle said. “It is definitely not just a me thing, it is a whole team effort.”
Defensively, freshman goalie Ellie Shahbo collected her fourth career shutout. With the Terriers only having two shots on goal, Shahbo recorded two saves and her fifth win of the season in the net. For co-captain Kathleen Young, this game saw the freshmen on the team take the forefront.
“We had our freshmen really step up this weekend,” Young said. “The second goal at BU was a freshman to freshman connection. It was nice to see how well they are doing and it was really energizing to our team to have Rachel playing so well.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 2
The Crimson traveled to Providence on Friday afternoon to face Ancient Eight rival Brown (4-7, 0-3) in its third conference game on the season.
While Earle, assisted by Young, quickly found the back of the net six minutes into the first-half to give Harvard a 1-0 lead, the Bears continued to fight. Earle scored again 17 minutes later, putting the Crimson up 2-0, but Brown’s freshman back and midfielder Danielle van Rootselaar countered less than a minute later. Before the end of the half, the Bears had scored another goal to tie the game.
“Brown was a particularly tough game for us,” Earle said. “We always struggle when we play at Brown. I think it’s just sort of the atmosphere when we are there.”
Following the first-half defensive struggles, the Crimson protected its half of the field. In the last 35 minutes, the Harvard defensive front prevented the Bears from taking any shots, allowing for a second-half shutout.
With 15 minutes left in the game, Young scored the game-winning goal, her fourth on the season, with an assist from Greenwood. According to Young, some of the struggles seen throughout the Brown game come with the territory of conference play.
“I think Ivy games always have a certain amount of pressure associated with them. I think Brown was a good team,” Young said. “We went out and had a lot of good chances that didn’t get converted so that is definitely something we worked on and talked about.”
As the season continues, the Crimson does not have any weekends with more than one game. According to Earle, the light schedule helps as the team recovers from injuries and attempts to maintain the momentum from an 11-1 start.
“We have got the foundation down to be able to really execute and give the Ivy League championship a real good shot, but to really make it ours, we really need to work on the little things and really keep our head in it,” Earle said. “To keep the momentum going we just have to keep doing what we are doing and making every practice a little bit better.”
Harvard will continue its quest for the Ivy League title this Saturday, hosting Cornell at Berylson Field.

As if mourning Harvard Time weren’t enough, we must now grieve the loss of our favorite meal of the day — lunch. Sure, breakfast is supposedly the most important, but let’s be honest here: how many of us take those 9 a.m.s or even get up in time for breakfast? With the new schedule leaving many without time for an adequate midday meal, we have been left with a hole in our lives that isn’t easy to fill. Other than reinstating Harvard Time, here are some ways the higher powers could alleviate our hanger.
Eating in Class
A shout out to the numerous good samaritans on our teaching staff who already allow this, but could we please add this to the Harvard College Handbook for Students just so it’s official? (Looking at you, evil math professor).
BoardPlus
Picture this: you are stranded at the Science Center, miles away from your House. You smell food and follow its scent all the way to the first floor and take out your Harvard ID before you realize that Greenhouse is gone, Clover does not accept BoardPlus, and nor do those tantalizing food trucks outside. We need more restaurants on Board and while we’re at it, an allowance if we’re not dining back at the home front.
24/7 Dhalls
If CVS can be 24/7, why not HUDS? Who doesn’t feel hungry at 9 p.m. when they eat lunch at 4:30? And Brain Breaks? Do they expect us to survive the night on fruit and cookies? We don’t necessarily want the works (immediately, that is), but we demand adequate nutrition.
Fly-By
Nope, not us; we are not forever bound to the hyphen like our friends at HUDS. Nor are we bound to the principles of cold, stale, flavorless, unhealthy food with disposable packaging. If we’re expected to rely on bagged lunches or Fly-By lunches five days a week, they need to be better.
Express Lines
This request is from the freshmen who are constantly battling lunch lines in Annenberg. Why can’t we pick three delicious items, gulf them down in five minutes, and not be starving through class? That way, we don’t have to hate the new schedule or that person ahead of us in line WHO JUST CAN’T DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT.
Lunchbox Couriers
If it works for the denizens of Mumbai, then why not us? All we need are roughly 50 volunteers willing to bike around the campus and deliver hot lunch to all bagged lunchers. Dishes can be left at designated spots or returned to dhalls at night and voila! We have successfully emulated a very successful lunching model.
If all else fails, at least we know what to say if HUDS rejects these suggestions: let us eat cake!
