After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In less than a month, I will be graduating from Harvard University. I will spend the rest of my life hiding the fact that I bleed Crimson—while subconsciously finding any opportunity to show off the alma mater to which I worked so hard to gain acceptance—and make jokes about Harvard Time to people who don’t care or understand (i.e., everyone). Since the gravitas associated with my termination as a Harvard student somewhat outweighs that of my time as a Crimson columnist, I will use this last piece as a final goodbye to an institution that has given me so much over the past four years.
Reflecting on my time here, there is nothing I would rather do than thank Harvard for all that it has done, and how better to thank an academic institution than to list all that it has taught me. So Harvard, a sincere thank you for teaching me the following:
How to deal with failure. I am a strong proponent of the maxim that hard work can take you anywhere. But at Harvard, trying your best does not always lead to success. I have been rejected from several job offers, scholarship awards, and even extracurricular activities. A proud person in a similar situation would have called it quits. But these failures built in me a resilience I could not obtain any other way. As many of my peers can probably identify with, I was not used to failure at my public high school, where I accomplished whatever I set my mind to. Ask me during high school about failure, and I would have stated it was not an option. Now, perhaps drunken from senioritis, I understand failures are a part of life. There will be people better than me, and working hard might not be enough to compete against them—but that’s okay. Failure doesn’t mean the end; it just means you have to find a more interesting route to get what you want.
How to relax. Perhaps an addendum to the last item, in which I learned that everything tends to work out in the end as long as you keep trying. Harvard has taught me the importance of relaxation. To paint a picture of how nerdy I was before coming to Harvard, I was the girl who chose to attend a Future Problem Solvers competition during Harvard’s pre-frosh weekend. I never relaxed in high school, and so I didn’t enjoy what I was doing as much as I could have. From Harvard, I take away the term “brain break” and will apply it to my everyday schedule.
But also how to not relax too much. I remember how relieved I felt after my five o’clock moment—humbled beyond belief, but also glad that my life seemed set. I was going to a great institution and there was no way I could end up failing after graduating from there. What I didn’t realize until coming here, however, is that Harvard does a great job of ensuring greatness from its students, but these countless opportunities need to be sought after. So underclassmen, shamelessly take advantage of these opportunities! Take a class from a Nobel laureate, experiment at Harvard’s Innovation Lab, and go to that next talk by a Supreme Court Justice. Because you will never get opportunities like this anywhere else, let alone for free.
How to seize the day. A friend once joked with me about how she flashes her Harvard ID at museums hoping to gain free admission. Riffing from the previous point, take advantage of what Harvard has to offer and use it for your benefit. Materialistically, this means getting any free merchandise that comes your way—I have more water bottles than could possibly be useful. But Harvard’s “carpe diem” extends to other opportunities that might add more to your intellectual and personal wealth, like taking challenging classes and talking with professors who are leaders in their fields.
 
How to be appreciative and thankful. It is easy to complain about Harvard, but when we stop to really think about how much Harvard has shaped us and helped us with our future plans, we should sheepishly accept that these complaints are meaningless compared to what Harvard offers us. If you’re still skeptical, take a minute to think of all the great things you’ve done at Harvard that would not be possible anywhere else.
This list could extend for pages, but these top five items are the ones for which I am most thankful. Harvard, it’s been a great four years, and I wouldn’t take back any of it for a second. Thank you for making me the person that I am today, a more relaxed, more confident Harvard graduate, ready to pursue my dreams without abandon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was not until I left China for Cambridge that I realized how much political and economic issues dominate Western representations of China.  At that time, I also began to realize how much these issues had dominated the domestic discourses in China. Renowned writer Saul Bellow once lamented the fact that political and economic discussions in the U.S. had replaced humanistic and philosophical concern for human wellbeing.  Now, I think he could say the same about China. Although it is understandable that China must use economic opportunities to attract foreign interests, the emphasis on China as an economic power has dehumanized China, making it easy to forget that it is a nation made of people. The Chinese Dream that President Xi Jinping promised when he took office cannot be just about the material wellbeing of the people. To make China a strong and impactful nation, China must take human and character development into its agenda.
The overemphasis of China as an economic powerhouse, both at home and abroad, has drastic implications. For one, it suggests that China can only influence the world through economic power rather than through the power of its culture. Second, the Chinese may become indifferent to the characteristics of the individual, thus diminishing the personal responsibilities that good citizens should have for their country and society as a whole.
We have repeatedly seen the impersonal, obedient representations of China and Chinese people in international media. Economic figures, mass labor, pollution, violation of human rights, and IT hacks are some examples of how China is seen through the Western lens. Due to market incentives, Hollywood movies often add a scene in Shanghai or Hong Kong and throw in a few minor Chinese characters. These representations are often faceless, mysterious, and uninteresting business or political men or women. Recent controversy on a Chinese edition of Iron Man 3, the only version that includes Chinese actors, exemplifies how the representations of individual Chinese characters are of marginal importance to the rest of the world; these characters are included in movies because of Chinese market demand rather than any sort of international appeal. We must chide the movie producer for selectively excluding these characters and thereby perpetuating the representation of their insignificance.
However, some Chinese people also have to take partial blame for the marginalization of their countrymen. In recent years, some Chinese people have not made a good name of themselves. From Hong Kong to the U.S., Chinese tourists are increasingly characterized by their buying power and their unsocial and disrespectful behaviors. They are welcomed largely as an economic necessity.
The marginalization of the Chinese as individual persons is partially caused by the focus on development that can be measured in numerical scales. Since Deng Xiaoping opened up China’s markets to the outside world, we have seen economic development and political reform at an impressive pace. Some of what people say is true: Chinese people are diligent, hardworking, and oftentimes put the group before the individual. But the modern Chinese also often focus more on things that can be measured, like achievements and gains, rather than on personal growth and development, which is naturally more ambiguous and difficult to measure.
Great nations leave a legacy to the rest of the world. Economic benefits come and go, but crafts, actions, and beliefs are passed on to the rest of the world for centuries to come. The U.S. has many problems with its democratic system, from an inability to carry out meaningful policies to chaotic congressional discussions. However, one thing the U.S. does have is its resilience. Despite its many past mistakes, including the recent failure to pass background checks on weapons, its people have shown instances where they are willing and able to "run again." So I must ask: What is China's legacy and character as a nation and as a people?
China must take human and character development as an important building block to fulfilling the "Chinese Dream." Besides offering its citizens the opportunity to own a car and a house, China must take on something more substantial and long lasting. It needs more than ephemeral wealth to characterize and glue its people together. Culture and personality will be the key. Only through a realization of human and character development can China truly offer more than what the misleading, dull representations suggest. From an economic lens, this type of development would enhance innovation and creativity. From a humanistic lens, the Chinese people would maintain a higher level of happiness through community, in spite of economic fluctuations, and offer their rich and historical array of cultural and spiritual ideas to the rest of the world.
Representations of Chinese by both themselves and the West do not present a full picture. I have known many Chinese friends who have equal potential for empathy and creative thinking as the entrepreneurs and humanitarian workers we see in mainstream media. These people, who could truly contribute to the wellbeing of their fellow man, have yet to be able to exert themselves as a representation of the Chinese character. China has the ability to offer its own citizens and the rest of the world much more than material progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent adoption of new examination policies comes as welcome news in the midst of this academic year’s own finals period. The proposal, put forth by the Committee on Undergraduate Education and recently approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, represents a meaningful effort on the part of administration to alleviate the sometimes overwhelming pileup of assignments that can occur at the end of semester. This attention to student experience is commendable. However, there is no clear indication that the changes by themselves will significantly improve the workload problems that can accompany reading and finals period.
Certainly, some of the reforms are quite refreshing. We are glad to see that regular classes are no longer allowed to take place during reading period. This mainly affects language courses, which previously would often continue to meet and cover new material during reading period. This change better reflects the spirit of reading period as a time for study. Under the new policy, it is clear that reading period is a time for review of the past semester’s content in preparation for a culminating assessment, as opposed to simply another week for more content to be squeezed in before finals.
Other issues are left ambiguous. The language of the new finals period, now officially titled “Final Examination and Project Period,” specifies exams “up to three hours in length.” Currently, classes holding exams are required to schedule a three-hour test. This model is unreasonable for all classes, especially those that also include other forms of final assessment like a project. In some circumstances, a one- or two- hour exam could suffice to assess students’ knowledge of relevant material. Briefer and more concise exams would certainly benefit students, freeing up time and reducing the stress of lengthy testing. As such, we hope that the new phrasing in the exam policy translates into increased flexibility for professors in constructing exams.
But the revised plan also leaves untouched several fundamental problems with reading and exams periods. Under the new policy, final assessments such as papers or projects must be due “no earlier than the fourth day of Reading Period” but before a class’s assigned examination date. While modifying the formally permissible range in which these assignments could be given, in all likelihood this will not meaningfully change students’ schedules. Papers and projects can still be due during reading period at professors’ discretion, and students can still easily be left facing multiple major assignments with closely coinciding due dates. In addition, by shortening reading period and extending finals period, the new plan simply recategorizes the time in which papers and projects can be due. While under the new plan assignments would be due during “finals” period, it is not clear that this would be substantially different in practice from the status quo.
FAS’s new reading and exam period policy brings much-deserved attention to the stress involved in finals period. Though a small step forward, this change is far from sufficient.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Massachusetts Senator and former Harvard Law Professor Elizabeth Warren introduced her first piece of legislation, a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to allow students to take out student loans at the same interest rate as banks. The bill addresses the important affordability issue facing higher education, but it fails to do so with sound economics.
In her unveiling of the bill, Warren pointed out that it “isn’t right” that the Fed charges banks an interest rate of .75 percent, while the unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan program charges students 6.75 percent. There are, however, many right reasons why the rates are different. The .75 percent discount rate is for overnight loans, which are loans only available to banks in good financial condition and which provide collateral for their loans. It is also not a day-to-day financing option for banks, but rather a last resort to ensure financial stability during events such as the September 11 attack. Student loans, on the other hand, are mostly risky long-term loans to individuals without credit history and collateral. Banks are very unlikely to default on their overnight loans, while 17.3 percent of student loans which originated in 2009 are expected to default over their lifetime. The suggestion that banks and students should have the same interest rate may be politically popular, but it shows Warren’s lack of understanding of debt and finance.
Senator Warren’s legislation aims to give young Americans access to artificially cheap financing options, but it could end up hurting the same people she is trying to help. The federal student loan programs make it easier to finance higher education, which increases the demand for higher education. The laws of economics predict that higher demand would increase both the price and enrollment of higher education. Indeed, between 2000 and 2010, college enrollment increased by 37 percent, while tuition increased by 71 percent. Tuition hikes cause students to borrow even more for their education, as student debt soared nearly 500 percent to $900 billion during the same period. The supply of artificially cheap loans has caused an arms race between tuition rates and increase of individual debt, and yet Senator Warren’s solution is to make student loans even cheaper.
One does not need to look far to find a historical metaphor for the student debt crisis. In many ways, the growing student debt is looking increasingly like the subprime mortgage bubble that plunged America into a recession. Both home-ownership and college education are part of the American Dream, the crux of the once-prosperous American middle class. In both cases, the government supported the expansion of credit to low-income communities. The political aura of equality and gauzy temptation of the American Dream disguised both bubbles as infallible "investments" that cannot possibly go wrong while ignoring the less promising economic reality.
Unfortunately, if the subprime bubble is any lesson, the student debt bubble will eventually pull down those who try to climb the increasingly steep economic ladder. Students who are encouraged by the government to make bad financial decisions at 18 may be excluded from future economic opportunities due to their poor credit histories. As more young people face an economically incapacitated life, the economy also suffers, as a generation of home buyers, consumers, and entrepreneurs are indentured to their student loans. The graduates’ ability to manage their debt is further deterred by persistent structural unemployment and global competition. A recent meeting between the Federal Reserve and an advisory body highlighted the macro-economic risks of high student debt, as the total student debt surpassed credit card debt and automobile mortgages. Given these grim signs, passing Senator Warren's bill would not be dissimilar to providing government-backed 0.75 percent home mortgages to everyone in the home-buying age at the brink of the subprime crisis. In the unlikely event that this bill becomes law, the bill’s poor timing and cavalier language will almost certainly make Senator Warren an easy target for political blame for a mess that she did not create but to which she merely added the final straw.
Given the poor economics of the bill, I can only hope that Senator Warren’s real intention is to garner publicity and popularity rather than actually implementing her policies. Senator Warren could, however, tone down her rhetoric and propose more realistic solutions. First, most student loans have notoriously inflexible terms. Making financing options more flexible will give graduates more financial autonomy on their existing debt. A floating rate on student loans can also allow new applicants to enjoy the current low interest rate. An ideal student loan system should also be more market-oriented. Students with different majors and who attend different types of colleges should have different risk profiles, and their loan rates should reflect these differences. Differentiating student loans would also encourage students to make more prudent educational and financial choices.
During her successful Senate campaign, Senator Warren established herself as a hardline liberal. However, as the subprime mortgage crisis and debt ceiling debate have shown, simple-minded rhetoric does not create good policies on complicated economic issues. It is perhaps time that Senator Warren puts more economic reasoning and less political point scoring behind her future bills.

Harvard completed a $168.5 million sale of Watertown’s Arsenal on the Charles to electronic health records company athenahealth, Inc., according to a Monday announcement by real estate firm Avison Young.
The sale, which was announced in December, includes the entire 11-building office park that sits on the Charles River less than 10 miles outside of Boston.
The 29-acre site was originally an armory for American troops in the Civil War and first and second World Wars and includes buildings that are around 200 years old. As an office park, the Arsenal on the Charles has served as athenahealth’s headquarters since 2005, and the company already takes up a large portion of the property’s 760,000 square feet.
A Harvard spokesperson said in December that Harvard has been reviewing its off-campus properties to see if they fit with the University’s mission of education and research—a process that led administrators to sell the property.
In the press release, athenahealth CEO Jonathan S. Bush said that the property’s location made it particularly attractive for the company’s expansion.
“We are excited to deepen our roots in Massachusetts; Watertown is our home,” Bush said. “The Arsenal on the Charles offers athenahealth everything we could ask for in a headquarters; its open and expansive architecture, outdoor campus feel, strong community, and proximity to Boston fit with our culture, strengthen our standing as a top employer, and provide an inspirational backdrop as we work to be medical caregivers’ most trusted service.”

More than a month after stepping down as head of Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs in protest of a Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ financial policy, government professor Beth A. Simmons said that top FAS deans have not formally acknowledged her resignation.
Simmons’ decision, which she announced in separate letters to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith and her colleagues on April 10, came after a long back-and-forth with administrators over a recent policy that requires regional centers to give large portions of their own excess funds to FAS.
Administrators instituted the so-called “taxation” policy in the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, which severely reduced the University’s endowment and the FAS budget—half of which is funded by that endowment.
Although originally implemented to temper FAS’ budget constraints, the policy was not dissolved when the FAS balanced its budget on schedule last summer. Simmons said that the Weatherhead Center has been asked to contribute more than $800,000 a year to FAS since the policy was put into place. Though the Center was happy to make that contribution on a temporary basis in the immediate aftermath of the crisis, Simmons said that the decision to make the policy permanent puts the center on dangerous footing.
“If the current policy continues, the Center’s reserves will dwindle so substantially as to compromise its ability to organize a serious program of research in international affairs for the hundreds of student associates and faculty affiliates across the University that have depended upon WCFIA for support,” Simmons wrote in an email to The Crimson.
But top FAS administrators did not acknowledge these reasons when they announced Simmons’ departure.In a letter to faculty members affiliated with the Center sent late last week, Dean of the Social Sciences Peter V. Marsden wrote that Simmons had decided to step down to pursue teaching and research.
In a statement to The Crimson last week, Smith commended Simmons’ leadership, but did not comment on the financial policy that she was protesting.
“Professor Simmons has led the Weatherhead Center with great distinction through very difficult financial times, overseeing an intellectually exciting program of scholarship and dialogue for Harvard faculty and students, as well as visiting scholars,” he wrote. “She is currently concluding her five-year term as director, which expires at the end of this academic year, and I wish to thank her for her significant dedication and service.”
Weatherhead affiliates familiar with the details of the resignation lamented the situation, saying that the departure of Simmons—who has led the center for two three-year terms—is a significant loss.
“Her resignation is a serious blow, since Beth is widely recognized as one of the top specialists on international affairs in the world today, in the prime of her intellectual career, and a fine, steady institutional leader,” government professor Robert D. Putnam said. “Losing her intellectual leadership in this way ought to be of concern to the University.”
A member of the Weatherhead executive committee, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitive nature of the subject, said that the FAS policy points to a larger shift in the way FAS administrators view international centers.
"She did all in her power to protect the interests of the Center and she tried to further invigorate international studies at Harvard, but encountered an administration determined to ‘tax’ the center to such an extent that it endangered its core activities,” the executive committee member said, adding that “effective” communication between the faculty and the administration has become difficult. “An atmosphere of distrust has poisoned relations between the Dean and the faculty at the WCFIA.”
Simmons has continued to perform many of the director’s duties since resigning in April and will continue with her teaching and research duties full-time in the fall. Marsden wrote in his email to Weatherhead affiliates that administrators will accept nominations for Simmons’ replacement through May 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 14, 2013, at 11:15 p.m.
Before she was accepted to Harvard, Emily seriously considered getting married. A high school friend had offered; he was an American citizen, and marriage would have provided her with a sure path to citizenship. However, Emily, a freshman at the College, is now hoping for another path to citizenship. Emily, whose name has been changed in order to protect her privacy, is one of the 11 million undocumented immigrants who would be affected by the new immigration proposal in Congress.
The bill would provide undocumented immigrants who arrived before 2011 with a 13-year process that would lead to legalization and eventually citizenship. It would provide a quicker path to citizenship for students like Emily, who would have qualified for the DREAM Act, a proposition from immigration reform that was voted down by the Senate in 2010. However, it also gives the opportunity for citizenship to their parents and other immigrants not encompassed in previous immigration proposals. For Emily, the bill’s passing would mean real, comprehensive immigration reform and security in her future here.
LIVING WITH UNCERTAINTY
Emily’s family came to the United States when she was six, largely for economic reasons. While she considers her family to be fairly well off, she said feels constant uncertainty about their future here. “One of my biggest worries is coming home from school and finding out that my parents were taken in a raid,” she said.
Deborah E. Anker, a clinical professor of law and director of the Harvard Law School Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, said one of the largest difficulties facing undocumented students here is “living with tremendous insecurity and uncertainty.”
This is a feeling that Emily knows only too well. Even though she has grown up in the United States, she says she lives with the fear that she will be forced to leave.
“There was a raid like two blocks down from where my dad worked once, so all these things are just always on your mind,” she said. “What happens if next time the raid is at my dad’s work? My whole life has been here. I can’t imagine going back and just starting a new life all over again.”
Emily has applied for and received DACA, a temporary two-year permit that allows her to live and work here. While it does give her some security, she said it still makes her feel unsure about her future. “I still don’t feel like a legal immigrant.”
Although Emily can renew DACA, it does not offer any permanent solutions. “What happens in two years, or in 4 years when Obama isn’t in office anymore? It depends on the administration if they want to keep up with it, and Romney was against it, so what makes me believe that another Republican won’t come and take it away?” she said.
Unlike DACA, the new proposal would allow Emily to stay here permanently as an American citizen. “My future would be more secure,” she said.  There’s no chance of me going back to a country and having to learn everything all over again.
SHOULDERING THE RESPONSIBILITY
Like many teenagers, Emily plans to get her driver’s license. But unlike other teenagers, she may also obtain a mortgage. Emily’s parents cannot legally obtain a mortgage, but since Emily has DACA, they may be able to take out a mortgage under her name.
This is one of several responsibilities that Emily thinks will be eased if the new immigration bill passes. Unlike the DREAM Act, the new proposal would also give her parents the opportunity to become citizens, and would be able to legally take out their own mortgage.
Knowing that her parents would be able to legally stay in this country would give her a lot more peace of mind about being away from home. She said that one of the hardest things about being at college is worrying about something happening to her parents, and not being there to care of her two younger siblings.
“Knowing that my parents will be included in this bill, it’s a huge weight lifted off my shoulders,” she said. “It would allow my parents to get their own education and fulfill some of their own dreams as well.”
The bill would also impact her experience at Harvard, and allow her to concentrate in a subject about which she is truly passionate.  Emily said that before receiving DACA and learning about the new immigration proposal in Congress, she felt that she had limited choices about what she could study.
“I was supposed to be the next breadwinner,” she said.  “A lot of the things I was looking at were things I didn’t want to do. They were just things that I could take to another country and make a lot of money.”
However, knowing she might be able to become a citizen has made her reconsider her academic options. She is thinking about studying English, something she said would not help her if she were forced to leave the United States.
Emily also thinks that national immigration reform would impact her experience on campus.  She said she has spun “a web of lies” for her roommates, and has only told one other student that she is undocumented.  She thinks that passing the new proposal would make her feel more comfortable talking about her undocumented status.
THE HARVARD BUBBLE
For Emily, the attitude on campus towards immigration has largely been supportive.” I feel like Harvard keeps you in this bubble,” she said, adding that she feels this bubble protects her from some of the problems that usually face undocumented teenagers.
Francisco D. Hernandez ’13, however, has not experienced the protective benefits of this bubble.  He said he thinks administrators could be more supportive of undocumented students, that immigration reform is not a prominent issue for most of the student body.
“There’s not a lot of talk on campus about immigration. We stay in the shadows,” Hernandez said of himself and other undocumented immigrants at Harvard. “If students don’t see or don’t know that we’re struggling, there can’t be a lot of push (for reform).”
However, he said that he has seen some change in attitude over his four years here.
“When I was a freshman, I felt like no one knew we were here,” he said.
He thinks that, because of movements towards immigration reform such as DACA, people are becoming more aware of immigration, though he said the shift is very slow.
“I don’t think we’d be having these talks on our camps if there wasn’t so much happening at the national level.”
While students here may not be well informed about the immigration debate, Anahi D. Mendoza Pacheco ’15, co-director of Act on a Dream, said that most are supportive. For example, she said some believe that the DREAM Act was for in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants, rather than citizenship. Mendoza also said that there is more support for undocumented student immigrants, since people believe that being undocumented is “not the fault of the student,” than for comprehensive immigration reform overall.
HOPING FOR CHANGE
Emily speaks of the opportunities the proposal would give her family in the future tense, and said she tries to stay positive about the bill’s chances. However, she does have her doubts. “Since I started following politics more, I’ve become very cynical about these things,” she said, citing the rejection of the DREAM Act.
Emily has thought her future if there is no reform. “We’re going to have to seriously start considering the marriage thing again,” she said.
Hernandez shares this cynicism, and said that he has stopped following the immigration debate because of the emotional toll it took.
“I used to follow the DREAM Act big-time,” he said. “It creates a lot of excitement. It creates a lot of hope. And to hear the results and that no, it didn’t pass, it just shuts me down.”
From a policy perspective, Anker sees immigration reform is inevitable.
“I don’t think we can continue on in the country this way with this underground population,” she said.
Anker also said she thinks a rejection of this bill would be “a setback to democracy and national security,” antagonizing the United States abroad and damaging relations with Mexico.
However, Emily said that it is important that people look beyond the politics.
“I think what a lot of people are forgetting is that these are people’s lives,” she said. “This is a human rights issue.”

When Peter D. Davis ’12 found a Cambridge Public Library book at his front door, wrapped in a bow, he knew who might have left it: Joanna Y. Li ’12.
Davis said that he had been going through a difficult time, and his friend had hoped to cheer him up with a quirky gift—a library book about a topic that interested him.
“She was deeply empathetic in a real way,” he said.
Li, a Kirkland House resident and neurobiology concentrator who had been on leave from the College since last spring semester, died in her Somerville apartment on May 7. She was 22. In an email to the Harvard community last Thursday morning, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds wrote that Li had lived off-campus since first taking time off from Harvard in February 2012. Hammonds wrote that medical examiners have not yet determined the cause of Li’s death, but that they do not believe foul play was involved.
Classmates and advisers remembered Li as a kind and discerning friend who often went out of her way to help out those around her with a well-timed gift, a meaningful conversation, or a ukulele serenade. Li applied her characteristic thoughtfulness to all aspects of her life, excelling in a number of academic fields and extracurricular activities while consistently downplaying her own accomplishments, they said.

Sima ’12, who dated Li for approximately two-and-a-half years after the two met at the beginning of their freshman year, said that when one of his friends took a leave of absence during their junior year, Li found a unique way to cheer him up—she decided to cut out a picture of the missing friend’s face, paste it to a pillow, and snap photos of the dummy “hanging out” with his friends.
“She was the kindest, most compassionate, most thoughtful person I knew,” Sima said.
Friends said that Li’s interest in other people carried over into everyday life as well.
Amy Guan ’12, a former Crimson news editor who shared summer housing with Li after their freshman and junior years, said that Li could have “long conversations about other people’s problems” without seeming overbearing or judgmental.
“I remember how great of a conversationalist she was,” Davis said. “If you were excited about something, she always had a new fact about it.”
Many acquaintances remarked on Li’s broad interests and general curiosity, which led her into a number of fields and activities during her seven semesters at Harvard.
In her freshman year, she took home a prize for a paper she wrote in her Expository Writing course—an essay that some students currently enrolled in the class are now assigned to read as a model of good writing.
“I always told her she should be a writer,” said Sima, who recalled Li’s interest in philosophy and poetry.
In the classroom, Li incorporated her varied interests into her primary field of study of neuroscience, often dabbling in bioethics and computer science.
“Those areas are difficult to integrate and very few students even attempt it,” said Ryan W. Draft, assistant director of undergraduate studies for the neurobiology concentration. “It was a promising academic trajectory.”
Draft said that Li often went out of her way to help out fellow students by attending advising events and serving as a teaching fellow in the courses Molecular and Cellular Biology 80 and Computer Science 50. She also worked for Harvard Brain, an on-campus neuroscience journal.
“She had a pretty big presence in the concentration when she was on campus,” he said. “I felt like our relationship with her was a little bit more substantial than it is with most students.”
Other friends remembered that Li, who volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and worked with the Elizabeth Warren campaign, cared deeply about social problems.
“She didn’t just care on paper; she cared with her whole heart on these issues,” said Davis.
And in each of these pursuits, friends said, Li exhibited grace and humility without fail.
“She was never showy with all her talents and she probably didn’t give herself as much credit as anyone else who knew her would,” Sima said.
Guan said that Li often checked up on friends, generally steering the conversation away from her own successes or struggles.
“I really think she underestimated herself,” Guan said. “I just really hope she was able to realize how much people loved her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust received $899,734 in salary and benefits in 2011, according to a recent filing with the Internal Revenue Service.
While that figure is about the same as last year’s, Harvard’s chief investment manager, who is paid far more than most administrators, saw a 52 percent increase in her earnings.
Faust’s compensation package includes $729,106 in reportable compensation, and the rest refers to benefits including her residence at 33 Elmwood, the Cambridge mansion that Harvard presidents have occupied since the early 1970’s.
In 2010, Faust’s total compensation equaled $875,331. Faust’s earnings are still significantly lower than those of many other University presidents, some of whom make well over a million dollars per year. The highest-paid University president in 2010 was J. Robert Kerrey of the New School, who made $3 million that year, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. Its review of executive compensation found that 36 presidents of private colleges made more than a million dollars in 2010.
But Faust’s pay is much lower than that of other top Harvard employees. The compensations of officials at the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s $30 billion endowment as well as its other investments, as usual far outpaced those of any administrators involved directly in the University.
HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo took home $5,323,753 in 2011, according to a press release Wednesday, while the company’s Head of Alternative Assets Andrew G. Wiltshire received $6,608,581 in total compensation, making him the top earner at HMC that year. HMC’s Head of Public Markets Stephen Blyth, who is also a statistics professor, made $6,161,489.
Those figures are significantly higher than their compensation in 2010, when Mendillo received $3.5 million and Wilshire, $5.5 million.
Still, they are far lower than those in the more distant past. In the early 2000s, some HMC investment managers earned more than $25 million per year, but those salaries fell following outcry from students and alumni.
The press release noted that more than 90 percent of the HMC officials’ compensation is variable and based on the performance of investments in a given year.
“This compensation system is designed to closely align the interests of the University with its investment professionals,” said James F. Rothenberg ’68, who is the University’s treasurer and chairman of HMC’s Board of Directors, in the announcement. “HMC’s market-beating performance in the reporting period once again added value to the resources upon which Harvard depends to fulfill its teaching and research mission.”
In addition to Faust, Harvard’s recent tax filing details the compensation of several other administrators in 2011. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, who took office in September of 2011, received $432,808 in salary and benefits from Harvard that year, while Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp made a total of $620,534.
Including benefits, Dean of the Business School Nitin Nohria was the highest-paid school dean with a total compensation package worth $662,054, followed by Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier at $621,373 and Public Health School Dean Julio Frenk at $606,612. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith received a total of $509,613 in salary and benefits.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: May 16, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that compensation packages for Harvard administrators were reported for fiscal year 2011 when, in fact, those figures are for their compensation during the 2011 calendar year. The story also incorrectly stated that University President Drew G. Faust’s 2010 calendar year earnings were for 2010 fiscal year.
