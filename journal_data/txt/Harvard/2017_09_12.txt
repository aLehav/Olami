Stephen King, the author of the 1986 novel upon which “It” is based, advises audiences to “enjoy the show, if you can.” As he creates a world that is simultaneously terrifying, comical and eerily normal, director Andy Muschietti dares the audience to do exactly that: Find beauty and joy in the horror.
Creating a movie based on such a classic novel, especially one with an earlier adaptation, is a dangerous game. “It” certainly rises to the challenge. Not only does the film skillfully bring to life Pennywise the Dancing Clown and other terrifying figures from King’s novel, it hones in on the essence of what makes the author’s books so engrossing and so terrifying: Despite the horrible creatures, supernatural events, and plenty of blood and violence, the novelist’s genius is clearest in his ability to make everyday activities terrifying. The new adaptation of “It” translates that quality to the big screen.
The film certainly does not shy away from blood and gore, and there are plenty of jump scares and moments of pure adrenaline. Some of the most chilling moments of the film, however, are not supernatural at all. As 6-year-old George first descends into the cellar, the music and lighting make the old dusty shelves as terrifying as Pennywise. George spins around to see two white lights that look like glowing eyes staring back at him. He desperately fumbles for a flashlight as the suspense grows until he flips the switch and reveals that the eyes were simply two glass balls, reflecting light side by side. Moments like this rekindle childhood fears, render them scary to the adult eye, and, later in the film, lend them a terrifying legitimacy.
In addition to the scares, “It” also offers some lighter moments. Again like King’s novels, the film creates believable and likable characters with lives beyond the horror. There are friendships, fights and scenes of young love, which, if slightly cliché, lend the film a normalcy that makes the horror feel more real. The constant wisecracks and jabs of the young protagonists—if mostly just curse words, sex jokes, and insults—yield laughter and provide some relief from the constant suspense.
In Muschietti’s adaptation, the lines between real and supernatural blur. It is never clear what is in the kids’ imagination and what is a real threat—in fact, in this film there may be no difference. The antics of the twisted bullies are just as terrifying as those of Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Violence between families and friends mixes with the supernatural evil at work.
The scenes of terror are also strangely beautiful. In fact, Pennywise’s gaping teeth reach their most terrifying and most alluring at exactly the same moment. From an egg standing on end, to rushing water, to a bleeding drawing, there are plenty of aesthetic moments. The film shows an incredible attention to visual detail which makes the most horrific points entrancing and ensures that, try as one might, it is impossible to look away.
The humor is equally disturbing. Actor Bill Skarsgård lends Pennywise a weird dance-like, singsong nature that makes him seem comical as he terrorizes the town. In this way, Skarsgård brings the concept of a demented clown and the twisted humor that comes with it to its full potential.The middle-school wisecracks also continue on through the moments of highest suspense. Meanwhile, scenes of friendship and love are casually permeated with blood. Fear and happiness occur not in alternation throughout the movie, but simultaneously.
In one scene, the group of kids known as the “losers” clean up a room covered in blood from floor to ceiling. Somehow, the scene is perhaps the most lighthearted in the movie. As the kids methodically wipe up blood and cart waste away in garbage bags they exchange comical loving looks and tease each other, eliciting laughter from the audience. The blood becomes normal, and the scene fun. Nothing registers as strange until after its conclusion.
“It” is terrifying, yet it is not depressing. Rather, the fear becomes energizing and the whole film feels like a powerful adrenaline high. Happy moments have a shadow of foreboding and fear, while the most gruesome and terrible moments become playful and fun. The horror of “It” is enjoyable, and that might be the most disturbing thing of all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the evening of Sept. 5, a crowd gathered in Brattle Theatre to hear best-selling novelist and Harvard creative writing professor Claire Messud discuss her latest work, “The Burning Girl,” with radio host Christopher Lydon. Organized by the Harvard Book Store and sponsored by WBUR-FM, Messud’s event sold out several days in advance––half an hour before Messud was scheduled to speak, a standby line of ticketless devotees stood waiting outside the venue for a chance at admittance.
Messud began the event by reading a passage from each of the novel’s three parts. Told from the perspective of 17-year-old Julia Robinson, “The Burning Girl” recounts the story of Julia’s friendship with a girl named Cassie Burns. Each of the novel’s parts details a different time in the girls’ lives, beginning from the hazily remembered origin of their relationship. The theme of knowledge and subjective truth, a topic Messud discussed at length following her reading, permeated each passage Messud read. “One of my preoccupations … [is the way] we tell stories in order … to resolve and cover over our uncertainties,” Messud reflected. “We think that we know people from this constellation of points … ‘I know that story, I know that girl … I’ve heard that story a thousand times.’ But actually, you never know that story.”
In “The Burning Girl,” Messud explained, Julia must grapple with what she knows and does not know to be true about her friendship with Cassie and its eventual end. “‘Cassie and I became friends in the second week of nursery when we were four years old. That was always the story,’” Messud read from her book, “‘though I can’t tell now whether I remember it, or have just been told so many times that I invented the memory.’”
Messud explained that obsession with knowing and not knowing has its roots in an experience Messud had as a child, when she relocated with her family from Australia to Canada, keeping in touch with her friends through mail. Thousands of miles away from her old life, Messud began to receive letters telling––in bits and pieces––of the death of an elementary school classmate. “[I was] haunted all my life,” Messud recounted, “that I only had those fragments [of information].” Decades later, Messud searched through digitized newspaper archives and was able to find articles covering her classmate’s death. When the official narrative conflicted with the details Messud remembered receiving from her pen pals, she began to consider more deeply the question of how certain truths come to be accepted as such despite the inherent subjectivity of human experience.
It was through this lens of memory and uncertainty that Messud approached writing from a teenage point of view. Describing “The Burning Girl” as “a children’s book for grownups,” Messud admitted that a great challenge she faced while writing the novel was creating content for adults while maintaining the perspective of an adolescent. However, she rejected the notion that a young narrator would be incapable of having adult thoughts or dealing with adult issues. “I’m a big believer in the complex realities of young people’s lives,” she said.
The event concluded with an audience Q&A session followed by a book signing, the line for which stretched across the room. Many of the attendees had long been admirers of Messud’s work, though some, like Lexington, Massachusetts resident Caroline F. Fitzgerald, were drawn to the event by the recent press Messud and “The Burning Girl” have received. “[Our book club] came primarily because … the feature on her in the Sunday New York Times magazine a few weeks ago really intrigued us about her as a person and author,” she said. “We feel the interview fell a little short of teasing that out of her. More about her personality, her process, the topics she might be interested in, the last question talking about her childhood and her mother and how she was raised in her family could have been an interesting conversation.”
“[This event] makes me want to read the book for sure,” Sabine B. Clark, another member of Fitzgerald’s book club, added.
Audience member Joyce Devlin, a Professor Emerita at Mount Holyoke College, left the event feeling similarly enthusiastic. “[Messud] has such an incredible vocabulary and her writing has such depth … I felt like I saw her thinking and her process, and I’m looking forward to reading more of her work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was well after five o’clock last Thursday, Sept. 7, and the Harvard Art Museums pulsed with life.
 
Hundreds of students sipped berry spritzers in the Calderwood Courtyard, bobbed to the ambient music, queued up to see brightly colored Andy Warhol prints, and milled about sculptures and paintings at the Museums’ Student Late Night. With offerings like miniature chocolate mousse parfaits, laptop sticker giveaways, and a live DJ, the annual event has continued to draw students since the Museums reopened in 2014. “We really believe in a generous welcome here, and this is our first chance to do that,” said Martha Tedeschi, director of the museums.
Throughout the night, visitors participated in undergraduate-led tours, viewed the Museums’ current exhibitions, and tried out image transfer techniques in the Materials Lab. All the while, DJ/rupture (Jace Clayton ’97) spun his electronic music in the Courtyard. His smooth jazz nudged people together in small clusters, and, later on, his house-music-style beats prompted a brave few to dance. “You’re putting all of these sort of different sounds and styles into a shared space, and you’re kind of creating a narrative of your own,” he said during an interview before the event.
Students from across Harvard’s schools swayed in the courtyard and trickled upstairs to the galleries.  Chao Gu, a student at the Graduate School of Design, said he typically frequents the Museums to break up his day, relax, and perhaps find inspiration. “I spend like an hour or two here. You need that sometimes,” Gu said, adding that he was pleasantly surprised by Thursday’s crowd. “I didn’t expect so many people. It’s like a whole ocean. It’s amazing.”

Nearby, Jessica S. Edwards ’21, Cassandra J. Marando ’21, Anna Kate Cannon ’21, and Sarah K. Lucioni ’21―new visitors to the Museums―chatted around a slender cocktail table cloaked in orange. “I had no reason before today to check out the Harvard Art Museums,” said Edwards, who learned about the Student Late Night during freshman orientation programming. Smiling and laughing with her friends, Marando said she was enjoying the night’s swanky vibe. “I feel classy. I can’t wait to walk around,” she said.
In addition to setting the evening’s soundtrack, Clayton curated a Spotify playlist in conjunction with a new exhibition which features Enlightenment-era artifacts from Harvard’s past. The exhibition—called “The Philosophy Chamber: Art and Science in Harvard’s Teaching Cabinet, 1766-1820”—showcases paintings and prints; animal, mineral, and plant specimens; scientific instruments; and other natural philosophy artifacts. Chris Molinski, the Museums’ Associate Research Curator for Digital Initiatives, helped orchestrate the sonic collaboration with Clayton. “[Clayton is] one of the leading thinkers imagining what the role of sound is in culture, in our lives, and in our creative lives,” Molinski said during an interview before the event, adding that Clayton’s work allows visitors to consider sound in addition to the visual art on display. “How can we use sound as part of the daily experience, walking through the galleries? How can we use sound to engage in playful ways, in scholarly ways, in ways that spark our imagination, and in critical ways?”

Tedeschi said the staff intended for the after-hours event to make the Museums accessible and comfortable, encouraging students to return. Before even entering the galleries, some students might have to work up the courage to approach the building’s physically imposing facade on Quincy Street, Tedeschi said. “If you don’t really know what’s in here, and you have lots of other choices for how you might spend your time, you know, what’s going to bring you in here? Well, if you’ve had fun with your friends here and if you found a few things you love in the galleries, you’re much more likely to feel comfortable coming back.”

John Wang ’16 is the current winner of the Radcliffe Institute’s 2016 Public Art Competition. The biennial competition, open to both undergraduate and graduate Harvard students, seeks submissions proposing a site-specific installation for the Susan S. and Kenneth L. Wallach Garden in Radcliffe Yard. This particular piece of land was the second-to-last plot purchased by Radcliffe and has played host to a collection of different buildings over the years. 2017 marks the centennial celebration of Radcliffe’s ownership of the plot.
Wang’s installation, “100+ Years at 73 Brattle,” won in the spring of 2016 and was built over this past summer. This site opened on Sept. 7 and contains a granite outline of former building footprints, commemorating the unique architectural history of the site. His piece also offers the public a space for sitting, gathering, and—he hopes—contemplating.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your academic background during your undergraduate years at Harvard?
John Wang: I studied History of Art and Architecture. In my freshman year, the department started an architectural studies track with the Graduate School of Design, so they started offering studios as part of the track. I was in Social Studies for most of sophomore year, and then I saw the studio offerings for concentrators only and decided to give a try at the studio courses. I ended up really liking it, so I stayed in the concentration.
THC: Do you feel like your background at Harvard prepared you well for this type of project?
JW: It was certainly helpful to have had some studio experience in thinking about design and manipulating a software and doing representations like collage necessary to convey the idea. But I think, now having completed the installation, what I also came to appreciate was the emphasis on history that comes along with being in the HAA department. The installation is driven of course by the history of the site and of buildings that are no longer there.
THC: What led you to submit to the competition?
JW: In my senior year they decided to start offering a J-term workshop for the competition. I think The Radcliffe Institute figured out that most people can design quite well, but they don’t know how to put together a budget that makes sense. And that’s a big part of the competition—how well conceived not only in terms of the design concept but also in terms of how this might actually materialize. Because it’s not just a competition of ideas but also execution.
THC: Where did you get inspiration for the design you proposed?
JW: As part of the workshop, we also had a session in the Schlesinger Library with the librarians there to just get a sense of what Radcliffe is and what it does. In the library, we were shown these historic maps of Cambridge, and it was there that I found out that there was something here before this blank-canvas yard situation. That map was from 1916. After getting the good news of winning the competition, I spent a summer doing more research about the history, and that’s when I found out there are all these maps of Cambridge starting in 1890, 1886, and there’s a whole series of atlases. You can also see the building footprints changing over time, you can see Harvard gradually expanding.
THC: Why did you find the maps an interesting source to draw on for a public art piece?
JW: It’s about history, in a very literal way an excavation ground, kind of digging-into the earth in an experiential way. It speaks to a process of looking and searching and thinking about materials as well. The stones that I proposed, and that we ended up using, were reclaimed granite. So they were granite that had been salvaged or reclaimed from other buildings, building foundations, bridges, pavings. These blocks of granite that had clearly been used before, there are drill marks and rust all over it here and there.
THC: How do you envision the community interacting with it?
JW: This is a hard question for me, because I don’t like to give a definitive take on the thing. I think the excitement for me in looking at something is to figure out for myself what it is about and to really let it be more opened-ended. When I designed it, I really imagined it to be more of a contemplative space. Originally when I designed it there was no wood, there was no garden, it was just stone. So it’s a very solemn space. Now it’s very lively—it’s got plants, there are bees flying around it all the time. The way the wood deck is shaped, it suggests a theater space, it suggests a performance space. And actually at the opening ceremony yesterday, one of the fellows, a playwright, walked past it and said she could write something and have it be performed right there.

Harvard professor and Mahindra Humanities Center director Homi K. Bhabha opened his conversation with world-renowned author Salman Rushdie on Sept. 8 by addressing the “elephant in the room”: similarities between Nero Julius Golden, protagonist of Rushdie’s new novel “The Golden House,” and President Donald Trump. The passage Rushdie read to begin the evening was a description of Golden—a septuagenarian real estate tycoon from Bombay with a “loud, animal quality” and “large, dangerous hands.” When asked whether the inhabitant of the Golden House was Trump, Rushdie deadpanned, to laughs from the packed house at the First Parish Church, “He’s not—he’s much more interesting. And he has a different relationship with his hair.” Despite a conversation laden with heavier themes, Bhabha and Rushdie continued to exchange quips, from Bhabha’s opening joke that “It’s wonderful to see you in a church again” to fun poked at Norman Mailer.
“The Golden House,” Rushdie’s thirteenth novel, follows the Golden family, Indian immigrants living in a secluded mansion in Greenwich Village, through the eyes of their neighbor, René. (Rushdie insisted that René is not Nick Carraway, although René actually mistakenly identifies with Nick Carraway in the novel.) The self-proclaimed “gangster novel” explores not only New York and America but also, through the dark presence of the Indian mafia that the Goldens fled, crime, politics, and power in contemporary India. The resonance between Golden and Trump seems an unintended byproduct of Rushdie’s ambitions for the book as a “big social novel.”
“The Golden House” diverges from its predecessors in having what Bhabha described as a “Balzacian density” of realism, but Rushdie’s novels have always lived at the nexus of politics and fiction. “Shame” and “Midnight’s Children” depicted, through their particular style of magical realism, the independence movement and Partition of India, respectively. Rushdie’s 1988 novel “The Satanic Verses”—as one is reminded every time Rushdie’s name comes up—was regarded as blasphemous by many Muslims and led the supreme leader of Iran to pronounce a fatwa, or death sentence, on Rushdie. One of the pre-selected audience questions that concluded the night, alluding to the fatwa and Rushdie’s vocal support of free speech, asked: “How do you suggest we counter extremists who use the guise of free speech to hold rallies that incite violence and hate? Where do you see the line between free speech and hate speech?”
Rushdie responded that he had “changed his mind three times” since the riots in Charlottesville, having initially disagreed with the ACLU’s decision to defend the white supremacists’ freedom of expression. “Now I think maybe they’re right, because it’s better to know who the assholes are,” Rushdie said wryly. “[T]hey were not rocket scientific because they didn’t put their hoods on, so we can find out who they were and deal with them.”
Despite starting and ending on explicitly political notes, Bhabha and Rushdie maneuvered throughout the evening to discuss the ways in which fiction can uniquely enrich our understanding of contemporary events. In “The Golden House,” Rushdie sets a characteristically globe-spanning stage, abundant with contemporary cultural references to Greek tragedy. Bhabha described the geographic juxtapositions and dense allusions as aspects of Rushdie’s myth-making, and Rushdie noted that the novel’s depiction of an individual’s collapsing faith against the rich background of various mythologies perhaps echoes the discord in our current cultural mythologies, where contentious issues like the American presidency or Kashmir are “described in such radically different language that there’s no meeting point.”
To bridge and reframe seemingly unrelated places and stories is something the novel is uniquely well-adapted to do, according to Rushdie. “The novel is not a good place for received ideas,” Rushdie concluded. “[I]t’s skeptical, it deconstructs people’s realities.” The abundant realities in Rushdie’s fiction are products of his own migrations, from India to London to America. In one of the most uplifting moments of the evening, Rushdie highlighted the ways that the newest generation of American immigrant authors are wielding fiction’s reality-changing powers to reshape the country’s literature and self-conception. Junot Díaz, Yiyun Li, Nam Le, and Jhumpa Lahiri, among others, are, in Rushdie’s words, “bringing into American literature a knowledge of the world which American literature historically hasn’t possessed and an enormous enrichment of the literature of this country.”
Familiarity with and personal relationships to Rushdie’s life and work brought many audience members to the event. Naman Patel, a researcher at Harvard Medical School, said that “Midnight’s Children” had helped him come to terms with his identity. “As far as understanding myself and my childhood, the animosities and hostilities—Rushdie helped me understand the Partition.”
Yasmine Flodin-Ali, a graduate student at Harvard Divinity School, said that she wished he had talked even more about his relationship to his inherited Muslim identity, and “the fact that he doesn’t identify as a believer, but that in the current climate he is seen as a Muslim despite that.” Overall, however, she was impressed by Rushdie’s candor: “I liked how unapologetic he was today and in his work about transcending boundaries. His answer about the boundaries of free speech was very honest; he was human in his response.”
Audience member Eric M. Fell, a scientific researcher in Boston, felt pleased by the political overtones in the conversation: “I think he really talked about what people wanted to hear: tensions in the world and how that affects people from different cultures and communities.” He  expressed optimism about “The Golden House” and Rushdie’s future work: “The way he’s lived his life, a book could already be written. He has so much more to tell, I think, and it’s inspiring.”

The danceable seven-minute songs that LCD Soundsystem produced before their disbanding in 2011 continued to shape the world of alt-electronica during their hiatus. “American Dream,” their new album released Sept. 1, does not disappoint—LCD Soundsystem creates catchy beats and alternative acoustics like those that brought them to prominence in the indie-alternative scene years ago. Superficially, this album doesn’t sound drastically different from LCD Soundsystem’s previous works. The same jolt-you-awake drop that distinguished “Dance Yrself Clean” makes its way into many of the tracks on the album, but here they are more subdued. In fact, the entire album sounds more mellowed-out than most of their previous works. But more importantly, the album takes the sentiments that old LCD always referenced, about change and (not) caring, and states them explicitly.
The opening track, “Oh Baby,” is the kind of song that you can put on the background for almost any audience. The sounds are perfectly compatible, blended, sweet to the ear, nonoffensive, but also have the least character, like a vanilla ice cream cone. Contrastingly, “how do you sleep?” has a much faster tempo that induces a degree of anxiety. The percussion sounds like a soundtrack for war, perhaps, or a run through a jungle. James Murphy, the lead singer, sprinkles in drawn-out calls resembling Tarzan’s that align perfectly with this theme. But the intensity doesn’t mean that this song is all serious—it’s definitely one of the groovier tracks in the album.
One of LCD’s last album’s hits was “I Can Change,” to which “i used to” presents a stark contrast. In this album, the earnestness that inspires “I Can Change” is gone. Instead, “change yr mind” shines as the statement song of the album, an anthem to detachment. LCD Soundsystem has always claimed in its music to be a band that’s just trying to figure it out for themselves, and this song emphasizes furthermore that the band doesn’t care about popular opinion. Murphy dismissively sings, “I’ve just got nothing left to say.” To emphasize that statement, the jarring pitches from the synthesizer in this song play over dissonant chords.
“American Dream,” the title track, is pensive and blue. Resignation flows under the rhythm, and the story is not a Horatio Alger story but rather a failed American dream. The song reflects on succumbing to the challenges of reality. LCD disbanded in 2011. The fresh-eyed band’s dreams died, and this song sees LCD regretting those mistakes and acknowledging the flaws in a musician’s dream.
Most of the album is rooted in the electronica genre, but LCD’s rock influences repeatedly enter throughout the album, especially on “Emotional Haircut.” With more guitar, in fact, the song could feel like a Cage the Elephant hit. Its aggressive words may make a stronger statement than “change yr mind,” but the musical and lyrical disjunct between this song and the others in the album make it somewhat of a poor fit.
The album ends on the longest track, the 12-minute “Black Screen,” but every second of those 12 minutes is worth the listen. The last quarter of the song actually sounds more like a beginning than it does an end, with sounds associated with morning—which is ironic, as the lyrics are grasping for something that’s already gone. As much as this album is about aging, it’s also about sorrow for the mistakes ignored on LCD’s previous albums.
After years away, perhaps Murphy needed to just pick up where he left off. Except for the sense of recognition of mistakes that occasionally comes through the lyrics, “American Dream” is missing something new. The quality of music is good, but Murphy’s lyrics aren’t enough to set the album apart from or above their previous work. LCD Soundsystem hasn’t lost its touch for music to dance the night away, but it comes back in “American Dream” with more thought-provoking themes that can also keep one listening, glued to the chair.

Politics can be a real witch. Directed by Steven Bogart, “The Weird” opened at the Calderwood Theater Pavilion in Boston. The experimental play imagines four scenarios in which witchcraft and supernatural powers could explain our current national political situation: from inadequate healthcare coverage to brainwashing and indoctrination, from censorship to millennial political inaction and pseudo-activism.
“The Weird” is predictably, well, weird. The play is brazen, strange, and un-ordinary. It is unafraid to be whatever it wants, to ask important questions, to demand your attention. The problem is clarity, or lack thereof: A nuanced and veiled approach to political statements can sometimes obfuscate the essence of the allegory. There’s little to establish unity between vignettes: The jumps are often abrupt, the disconnects from scene to scene jarring, verging on inaccessible.
Still, what is accessible—the immediacy of raw emotion—packs a powerful punch. “Gather,” written by Kirsten Greenridge, is the most fragmented of the four vignettes, in which Ciera-Sadé Wade plays Olivia, an extraordinary woman whose mother dies as a result of terminal illness and insufficient healthcare. In the climax of the play, Olivia ultimately confronts Richard (Eliott Purcell), an inattentive senator responsible for the vote that minimized her mother’s healthcare availability. Wade’s performance as Olivia grips: “I have been calling,” she says. “I prayed so hard. The universe did not accommodate me. I just know I prayed, and you listened to my phone calls.”
And the mood swings wildly, and often. In “Era Era,” the fourth vignette, Kara Arena and Alexis Scheer play Victoria and Patricia, respectively, hosts of a caricature of a progressive radio show. Arena and Scheer’s performances are some of the most free-spirited and unabashed in the play: at one point they even impersonate Matthew McConaughey, thumping their chests and muttering “all right, all right, all right.” At another, Patricia whines, “White women are the worrrst,” and identifies as a woman of color because she’s “half… I’m Italian-Irish.” Obehi Janice’s script is an insightful and sharply funny satire of millennial progressivism and inaction, reminding us that sometimes resistance looks like two women on a frivolous radio show—or, as one caller to the radio show demonstrates, the cathartic act of crushing a peach with one’s bare hands, a symbolic act of therapeutic brute force as opposed to “freaking out and taking on the burden of humanity.”
If these excerpts sound odd, they are not only emblematic, but perhaps an understatement of the extreme strangeness at work in “The Weird.” (The other two involve a Puritan pastor’s sex fantasy and a girls’ boarding school specializing in brainwashing, the only cure for which is eating apples.) “The Weird” is the kind of postmodern play that does not cater to anyone or give answers; it asks you to put the pieces together on your own, to parse and ponder the material even after the production, in all its complexity and peculiarity and, well, weirdness. It isn’t easy, but neither are times like these. And as Vicky reminds us in “Era Era,” “There’s something in the air … This isn’t normal.”

“Bad” has always been my favorite Michael Jackson album. “Thriller” functions too much as a collection of singles, albeit an extremely high-quality one. “Off the Wall” is exceptional, but lacks a certain spark. “Bad” is a far more exciting album than Jackson’s most acclaimed because it’s not only a cohesive album, but it also represents Jackson’s greatest and most experimental foray into rock.
For years, most critics discussed “Bad” predominantly in the context of “Thriller.” Jackson wanted the follow-up to what was already the best-selling album ever to sell twice as many copies. This was in the mid-’80s, when he was by all accounts the biggest star on the planet, but Jackson had yet to make, in his eyes, a complete solo album. “Bad” was supposed to be the biggest album ever, supposedly with planned appearances from Whitney Houston and Prince, so by the time it was released, the expectations were high. It obviously didn’t live up to expectations, and while it was the first album ever to send five hits to the top of the charts, it was seen as overpolished, trying too hard to emulate “Thriller” with less success. Over time, however, it’s become easier to separate the two, and “Bad” on its own is easily the boldest album Michael Jackson ever made.
While “Bad” isn’t sonically cohesive, there’s a subtle unity between the songs as Jackson attempted to prove his maturity through a rock sound. On “Thriller” and on “Off the Wall,” Jackson sounds friendly and almost childlike; “Bad” sees him as more mature and sinister. This isn’t to say that “Bad” is entirely dark—tracks like “The Way You Make Me Feel” and “Just Good Friends” are pretty affable—but  more adult themes, like lust and anger, coat the album. For all the contemporary complaints about “Bad”’s overproduction, the album is sonically all over the place, with everything ranging from quieter piano ballads to hard rock.
Jackson and Quincy Jones were masters of album construction, so “Bad” mellows from hard funk on the title track to the softness of “Man in the Mirror” and “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You,” and eventually grows into the hard rock of “Dirty Diana” and “Smooth Criminal.” The varied instrumentation helps express the darker, more mature facets of Michael Jackson: The seductive funk showcases his lust, while the heavier guitars and louder drums expresses a rage and frustration with the world around him.
Michael Jackson’s venture into hard rock is a big part of what makes “Bad” great. The album’s harder sound creates an enthralling sensation that keeps it delightful despite the darker tone and themes. The gated reverb on every song creates a whip-like sensation that gives the album an immensely powerful feeling, punctuating every emotion Michael Jackson feels. On the angriest tracks on “Bad,” these sounds combine to showcase Jackson’s frustrations. “Dirty Diana,” for example, sounds especially dire because of the howling guitars and the way they pair with Jackson’s pained yelps. Jackson and Jones build even the softer tracks with a rock sensibility. “Speed Demon” builds up the same way any typical classic rock song does, if somewhat more understated. But there’s a forcefulness on almost every song that Jackson never possessed before or after, and the rock construction meshes with this to galvanize the album.
Every moment of “Bad” feels huge, and nearly every song gleefully defies what one would expect to come next on a Michael Jackson album. Yet everything comes together seamlessly through the rock instrumentation. The forcefulness on “Bad” meshes with the rock instrumentation in large part because of what it represented in Michael Jackson’s maturation. When “Bad” was released, Jackson was attempting to assert himself as a fully solo artist and wrote nine of the album’s eleven songs. Jackson was able to utilize a harder sound to represent his adulthood and independence. The rock guitars are louder and theoretically less radio-friendly than the pleasant funk pop of Jackson’s youth. Part of why “Bad” is so stellar is the way that Jackson sonically and thematically forces public acknowledgement of his talent through a new genre. By asserting himself as an adult in this fashion, Jackson could gain the respect of people who previously disliked him or didn’t think he made his own music. Even though he wasn’t given the credit he truly deserved for this venture, 30 years later, it’s time he was praised for his riskiest and most experimental work.

No, “Lindsey Buckingham/Christine McVie” is not quite a new Fleetwood Mac album. But it comes pretty close: Between them, the singer-songwriters whose names comprise the clunky title wrote the majority of the band’s peak-period pop rock (with Stevie Nicks rounding them out), and a few tracks feature the band’s trusty titular rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Luckily for fans of that band, Buckingham and McVie recreate much of their old band’s appeal—instantly catchy hooks, shimmering production, and irresistible vocal harmonies. While a few fillerish tracks make Nicks’ absence felt, “Buckingham/McVie” (the album’s working title, which it should have kept) includes some real standouts that would fit right in on “Tusk” or “Mirage.” Any Fleetwood Mac fan would do well to give it a listen.
True to the structure of its title, “Buckingham/McVie” alternates between songs sung by Buckingham—the guitarist of heyday Mac—and by McVie, the keyboardist. Buckingham begins the album with a fakeout: He nearly croaks the first lines of the hook-filled romp “Sleeping Around the Corner,” leading at least your reviewer to wonder, horrified, if Buckingham, now 67, had recorded the album with his voice shot. But a couple lines later, Buckingham’s voice opens up just as the pop-rock arrangement blossoms. “Corner” and its immediate successor, the reggae-inflected “Feel About You,” impressively announce that their writers have retained their musical powers, though each track features lyrics nearly as awful as their melodies are engaging. Interpreted generously, “Feel About You” is not so bad: The chorus line “That’s how I feel about you” insists that McVie truly means the devotional figures of speech, however cliched. “Corner,” on the other hand, includes lyrics like “I never meant to give you a frown.” Lyrics, especially Buckingham’s, are not the album’s strong point. “In My World,” which boasts a charming guitar riff, might have better overcome its overslick production with subject matter less grandiose or better executed. Do nights really “unfurl”? Apparently, if one needs a rhyme with “world.” (Even worse, that rhyme is recycled from 1983’s “Eyes of the World.”) “Love Is Here to Stay,” an overlong acoustic piece with less going for it, also suffers from familiar and stuffy wordcraft.
But those lyrics are no match for Buckingham’s gift for melody. His best offering, “Lay Down for Free,” is nothing short of pop-rock perfection. Like most of the album, it shares with classic Fleetwood Mac a superabundance of instrument overdubs, a Buckingham technique that risks overproduction but immensely rewards repeated listens with undiscovered hooks and flourishes. McVie, who had retired from music for almost a decade, seems to have benefited from the time off. In “Red Sun,” the album’s other highlight, she again achieves her signature feat—combining mature emotional content with the sheer joy of her music. “My mind is filled with journeys echoed with your smile / No, you won’t take that away from me, even if you tried / Sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me? / And it’s worse for me at night, you know, when the red sun kisses the sea,” she sings with equal parts defiance and longing heartbreak.
Like the Buckingham- and Nicks-led comeback album “Say You Will,” “Buckingham/McVie” largely sees its songwriters rewriting their glory-days hits rather than breaking new ground. “On with the Show,” a personal anthem for the still-touring Buckingham, uses the same ringing guitar line as “You and I, Part II” from “Tango in the Night”; the vocal interplay on “In My World” recalls the same album’s “Big Love”; McVie herself compared the piano ballad “Game of Pretend” to the old concert-closing favorite “Songbird” while introducing it at the end of the duo’s Boston performance in June. But even if the approach is familiar, it did dominate airwaves and sell tens of millions of records—and fans spinning the latest from the 67- and 74-year-olds rightly expected more of the same: conventional pop-rock, expertly crafted by veterans of the genre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As University President Drew G. Faust prepares to leave her position at the end of the academic year, we commend her prudent leadership amid the wide-ranging changes that have marked her tenure.
Faust’s decade at the helm of the University has been marked by political and economic turmoil. Only a year after she took office, the Great Recession slowed many planned University projects (such as the Allston campus expansion) and slashed the endowment by $11 billion. Though many, us included, viewed her leadership as too conservative at the time, we applaud the way Faust calmly stewarded Harvard through the crisis.
While many painful cuts were necessary, we are glad she performed triage and maintained priorities such as financial aid. And while we do wish that she had taken more decisive action with the endowment during the past several years, Harvard is in a much better position to grow today thanks to Faust. This is not an achievement to be taken lightly, nor is a capital campaign that has been the most successful in higher education. And now, as the finances normalize again, we hope that some budget cuts can be reversed, such as reductions to workers’ compensation—and, dare we suggest, hot breakfast in the Houses?
Finances aside, Faust’s tenure has been remarkably wide-ranging. Her ability to mend relationships with the Faculty—particularly after the stormy clashes of her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers—has not gone unappreciated. The resurrection of the Allston campus expansion, particularly after the stalled construction incited passions among campus and community members, has been remarkably expedient, considering the campus is slated to open in two short years. And we cannot forget her tireless lobbying efforts in Washington, which have advanced the interests of the University and its students. Her most controversial action—imposing sanctions against the members of single-gender social organizations—has also helped to further campus discourse surrounding the nature of these clubs and led many groups to change their policies.
Of course, despite all this, Faust was not perfect. We remain aware of many painful issues on this campus that she could have attempted to address more substantively. For example, issues of diversity and inclusion, with which the campus has grappled over the last few years, have not been fully addressed. In addition, as we learn more about the actions taken by Harvard in its past, we wish Faust had gone farther in aggressively recognizing the uncomfortable parts of our history. The superficial changes to seals and alma maters do not resolve the underlying issues. And as those who witnessed the HUDS strike recall, Faust’s opposition expanding workers’ benefits serves as a reminder of her administration’s reluctance to enable campus workers to join in the University’s wealth.
Overall, though, President Faust’s accomplishments are wide-ranging, and Harvard is in a much better place to move forward than just a few short years ago. She has undoubtedly strengthened the University; we hope the positive changes she worked to affect are not lost under her successor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first time I was asked to recite a roster, I was probably 11 or 12 years old. The joke was on the guy who’d challenged me, because I owned a calendar depicting the team in question, Liverpool. (I know, I know, withhold your judgment.) I’d rattled off all 12 players on the calendar before he conceded. In retrospect, I could’ve made up my own lineup and he might not have realized; he wasn’t even a Liverpool fan himself.
The last time I was asked to recite a roster was a few months ago; the asker didn’t watch the sport in question. I’ll give him this: He was honest. “You only like the team because you think their star player is hot,” he’d said, as I sputtered with indignation and listed off the entire team. At first, I was pretty proud that I’d remembered 20-something names. Once the self-satisfaction faded, and I’d made enough jokes about it, I was angry.
Quizzing is a phenomenon that no newbie fan—especially no female newbie fan—is a stranger to. One could even classify these variations into different species. There’s the classic: “Name more than one player on that team.” There’s the evergreen: “What’s offside?” or “What’s icing?” or “What’s a no-ball?”—every sport has its own version. Beyond that, the quizzing gets even more eclectic: “Name the reserve players on the 1984 world championship team, if you’re such a big fan.” Well, I was busy memorizing the blood types of the 1980 team, so I’m afraid I left that one out. Sorry!
There’s so much to unpack about this flat-out ridiculous questioning. Where does it end? What’s the catch-all question that really, truly proves I’m a gold standard fan? New fans aren’t limited just by their lack of experience. They’re also limited by age. I was born in 1998; naturally, that means I don’t know much about teams that came before that. No matter how much I read or how many highlight reels I watch, I’ll never have the same experience as someone who’s watched Wayne Gretzky play live. Does that make them automatically a more legitimate fan than me? Am I already a better fan than the generations after me that won’t see Alex Ovechkin, or Wayne Rooney, or Roger Federer play? Because I don’t want to be. I don’t even want to be ‘better’ than the fan who just watched their first game. It’s arbitrary, and it has, I think, something to do with the human tendency to romanticize the past. In our minds, the golden age of every sport has already passed, and we’re blind to the countless golden ages being written in front of us, every day.
But quizzing isn’t just about not letting in newcomers. It’s about dismissing and invalidating the voices of people who’ve been there all along. The real problem with gatekeeping is that it’s almost always at a woman’s expense, or an LGBT person’s expense, or a person of color’s expense. It’s sexist, it’s homophobic, it’s transphobic, it’s racist. Sometimes it’s all at the same time. Since you’re so fond of asking questions, quizmasters, ask yourselves: Would you really have said the same thing to a “typical” white cis male sports fan? If not, then it’s time to admit that quizzing is about more than allowing only the truest of fans to join your ranks. It’s about keeping those that you see as different, as outsiders—as not the right audience for sports—on the outside. It’s about you, as a sports fan, deciding that someone isn’t worthy, before they’ve even answered your question. The decision is made in the asking.
As fans, we should be delighted when someone else enjoys what we watch, because a wider, more diverse audience means an improved product. It shouldn’t matter if some kid bought a Messi jersey after watching Barcelona play yesterday. After all, it’s money to your team, and that can only help. This isn’t just about inclusion and allowing the game to grow; it’s about accepting that some “unconventional” sports fans have really always been around. It’s time that the straight white cis male sports fan made space in the stands, because the rest of us are tired of standing all the way in the back.

If you go to the room on the second floor of The Crimson, fondly called the Sanctum, you’ll find our archives. Decades worth of the daily print version of the newspaper line the walls of the room. Critical moments in which Americans learned to understand themselves are immortalized in its pages: South African divestment, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Iraq. But among the pages and pages of thin newspaper paper, one story has been remembered in the archives and forgotten by American memory.
Last week, I opened one of these bound books to find a story from December 14, 1981. It spread across an entire page of the paper, included two photographs, and had the glaring headline:  Forgotten El Salvador. It rebuked the American public for ignoring the escalating state violence against Salvadoran citizens, even though Americans had just held protests in response to the killing of an American missionary and three American nuns by the Salvadoran National Guard just a year before. As the article claims, “It is an old axiom that only the threat of American deaths will arouse American concern; El Salvador seems a case in point.”
What the Crimson editor who wrote 35 years before me might have guessed, but couldn’t have known for sure, is that America would continue to forget El Salvador. The Reagan Administration continued funneling hundreds of millions of dollars towards a repressive El Salvadoran government that killed over 1,000 peasants in a single day in 1981, a fact that the Salvadoran Ambassador in Washington then falsely denied.
The final death toll of the conflict was over 75,000 Salvadoran men, women, and children and millions more displaced. Despite its heavy involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War, the United States government has not apologized for training murderers, and the American public has largely forgotten its repulsive involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War.
American forgetfulness spans much further than the 1980s, however. El Salvador’s 12 years of civil war forced people to leave their country for safety in the United States. Yet, the United States did not grant Salvadoran immigrants refugee status (even though most fleeing El Salvador during its Civil War met the conditions set forth by the United Nation Convention of 1951 and U.S. Refugee Act of 1980).
Instead of acknowledging its role in displacing millions of people, the United States has instead engaged engaged in a political rhetoric that criminalizes undocumented Salvadorans, speaks of short-sighted walls, and advocates for ripping families apart. American political consciousness views undocumented immigrants from El Salvador as part of an “immigration crisis,” but fails to acknowledge the role American foreign policy had in their migration.
There’s a moral argument to be made about our responsibility in handling the fallout of our involvement in El Salvador. When I spilled milk as a child, my mother made me clean it up. But apparently if it’s blood—and you’re the United States—it becomes someone else’s responsibility. But if the countless lives of people in the countries whose political systems we’ve tried to “shape” are not compelling enough, let’s make this about Americans.
There are more than two million Salvadoran-Americans living in the United States today, including the  handful of us who study here at Harvard. Those who are second-generation, meaning that they were born and raised in the United States or who came as undocumented youth when they were children, know nothing but America. Our childhoods are held together by the sounds of the Pledge of Allegiance in the morning and PBS television shows in the afternoon. We grew up learning about the founders of our nation who, for reasons we didn’t understand, didn’t look like us. And we try tirelessly to be “American” enough.
But no matter how hard we try, we are still treated as an Other and are forced to live in the hyphen, cautiously straddling the link between the part of us that is Salvadoran and the part that is American. For those of us with connections to our parents’ home country, there’s an inexplicable conflict.
As Americans, we carry the burden of the United States’ military oppression and slaughter of thousands of people in the country where our parents took their first steps. As Salvadorans, we grapple with poverty, violence, and criminalization in the United States that stems from military involvement by the very country we now call home. As we embody both the oppressor and the oppressed, American collective memory forgets its role in fabricating the contradiction inherent to our identities.
By erasing our military involvement in El Salvador, America ignores a central part of who I am. My birth is the direct result of U.S. foreign policy, a military project in which I had no say. While certain Americans can afford to forget the various military projects we’ve embarked on abroad, there is a substantial number of Americans who don’t have that luxury. Those who make this country great, vibrant, and diverse are most damaged by its short memory span in remembering its imperialistic military history.
The United States continues to involve itself abroad, with missile strikes on Syria serving as just one example. When we attempt to shape political systems abroad, we inevitably begin the process of creating a new group of Americans whose lives fall between two nations. To reject these Americans, by refusing to settle refugees or immigrants, is to forget critical parts of American history and disrespect the hyphenated-Americans already living here. We have already forgotten El Salvador. We can’t afford to forget anyone else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Robin Kelsey, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Dean of the Arts and Humanities, has formed a student committee to more directly engage undergraduates, he said in an interview last week.
Kelsey, a History of Art and Architecture professor, said that the committee will include members from all four undergraduate classes and several different concentrations. Kelsey took over the deanship from Comparative Literature professor Diana Sorenson in March 2016.
“Over the course of last year, I came to think that there was tremendous untapped potential for stronger student engagement,” he said.
Kelsey said the board’s membership is not final, though the group’s first meeting happened last week.
The board’s establishment coincides with several other developments in the division. Most notably, the History and Literature concentration introduced an Ethnic Studies track after calls from student activists for more coursework in the field.
But because History and Literature is not a department and cannot tenure faculty, some activists have been disappointed by the dearth of ethnic studies faculty on the tenure track.
“I think one of the advantages to putting the track in Ethnic Studies is that, by its very nature, the interdepartmental program is more nimble than some of its departments which rely more extensively on ladder faculty,” Kelsey said. “In the long run, any significant intellectual initiative within the FAS needs to have as part of its resources ladder faculty.”
Kelsey said he hopes to find “the faculty resources to support our ambitions.”
Another change that will affect all divisions within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the transition to a new General Education system. Additionally, Harvard will roll out a new course schedule that will eliminate the seven minutes of passing time between classes known colloquially as “Harvard time” and extend the standard class block to 75 minutes. Both are set to take effect in the fall of 2018.
Kelsey said he can’t predict how the new Gen Ed program—which includes distribution requirements across the four divisions of FAS—will affect the number of students taking Arts and Humanities courses, but that he “welcomes the challenge” of developing new courses that will attract students.
He is similarly optimistic about the change in standard course length.
“I think that this kind of shaking up of the habits of pedagogy can be a very good thing,” he said. “My hope is that this will get us out of lecturing to a passive audience.”
While most students must take courses in the division to fulfill General Education requirements, the number of concentrators in the Arts and Humanities remains comparatively low. According to the Crimson’s annual survey of incoming freshman, only 11.2 percent of the class of 2021 anticipates concentrating in the division.
Kelsey said he is focused on ensuring that all Harvard students experience the Arts and Humanities “at their best.” For Kelsey, this focus includes producing compelling freshman seminars and Gen Ed courses. He added he isn’t interested in “twisting anyone’s arm” to get them to pick a concentration within the division.
“No one studies the Arts and Humanities because their parents insist upon it,” he said. “That’s something I cherish about the Arts and Humanities.”

UPDATED: September 12, 2017 at 11:44 a.m.
Harvard University Health Services has confirmed a few isolated cases of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease on campus, prompting Currier House staff to alert students of prevention efforts.
In an email sent to House residents on Monday, Currier House Resident Dean Amanda S. Lobell ’99 warned students to be vigilant of cases of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease going around campus and Cambridge.
The disease—a viral illness which can result in mouth sores and skin rashes —is the latest unconventional ailment to hit campus in recent years. Though HFMD is most prevalent among infants and young children, adults can still contract the illness, although they may not show symptoms.
HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry confirmed that there have been isolated cases of HFMD on campus in an emailed statement, though he did not specify which Houses were affected.
Although Lobell wrote that HFMD “ordinarily isn’t debilitating and passes after a few days,” she added that it was best to take preventative measures, including “frequent handwashing” and “cleaning up shared private bathrooms.”
“As with the spread of any illness, HUHS encourages good hand washing and avoidance of contact with sick individuals,” Perry wrote in his statement.
Lobell’s email went on to state that HFMD can be transmitted through saliva or blisters. Earlier symptoms include fever and a sore throat, which can develop into mouth sores and skin rashes.  The email also cautioned that although some infected people may show no symptoms, they would still be able to spread the virus to others.
Many Currier residents said that the email was the first time they had heard of HFMD.
“I don’t know what to think because I don’t know what this is in comparison to a cold,” Brennan Dizdar ’19 said. “I don’t know what the magnitude is.”
Other students said the email reminded them of past infectious disease outbreaks on campus. In spring 2016, a mumps outbreak spread through campus, infecting more than 60 Harvard affiliates. Several students were quarantined in an effort to mitigate its spread. In March, Cambridge and Massachusetts health officials investigated Mather House residents after a resident was suspected of contracting tuberculosis.
“Is this mumps again?” Ali Dastjerdi ’19 asked. “Why do weird diseases keep spreading on our campus?”
Still, several students in Currier said that they were largely unconcerned with the disease.
“I wasn’t really scared or anything,” Ziyad “Ziko” J. McLean ’18 said. “ I’ll just be more mindful of not sharing drinks and washing my hands more often.”

Students at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will have access to subsidized child care through Care.com, which matches families to caregivers for children, seniors, and people with special needs.
The school recently announced a new program that provides all Ph.D. students free membership to the site, which normally costs $140 per year, as well as 10 days of childcare per year subsidized by Harvard.
GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall said the Graduate Student Council, GSAS’s student government, developed the idea for increased child care benefits.
“During a meeting with the GSAS dean, the Graduate Student Council (GSC) asked GSAS to investigate the possibility of providing Care.com access to students,” Hall wrote in an emailed statement. “In response to the GSC’s advocacy for student parents, GSAS is pleased to fund this new benefit.”
Blakely B. O’Connor, the Graduate Student Council’s secretary, originally had the idea to offer Care.com benefits. O’Connor, a student and a mother, had used Care.com and realized it could help other student-parents balance the responsibilities of graduate school and caring for children.
“I am pleased to see the implementation of this benefit for graduate students with children. I think it is a step in the right direction toward alleviating the financial and scheduling burdens that can be especially difficult for graduate-student parents,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
In addition to serving on the GSC, O’Connor is a member of the Harvard GSAS Student-Parents Association. The group “advocates for increased institutional and financial support, identifies and addresses problems that are unique to international graduate student parents, and increases awareness of issues regarding housing, childcare, and community,” according to its website.
In addition to babysitters for children, GSAS students will be able to look for care options for senior citizens through the new program, and book care in their homes or in child care centers.
While the cost of membership on Care.com is free through the GSAS program, students will still have to pay small fees for using the site. According to the GSAS website, benefits will launch later this fall.
The announcement comes as some students have criticized the benefits Harvard offers them. Graduate students received a smaller-than-usual stipend increase this year, and some said they saw their healthcare costs increase after the University switched its pharmaceutical provider.

As students return to campus for the new school year, completed and attempted bicycle thefts have seen a slight uptick at Harvard and in areas surrounding campus.
Since the first freshmen arrived on campus for pre-orientation programs on August 15, there have been 17 bike thefts or attempted bike thefts, Steven G. Catalano, Harvard University Police Department spokesperson, wrote in an email.
These thefts represent a roughly 20 percent increase from the same period last year. They have occurred in several locations around Harvard’s campus, including the Yard, River Houses, Business School, and Longwood campus housing the Medical School and School of Public Health.
According to Catalano, HUPD advises students to register their bicycles and take proper precautions when locking them. Of the 17 bicycles stolen since August 15, only one was registered with the police.
“When locking your bicycle, use a steel ‘U’ lock rather than a cable lock. Lock the frame and tire together to a stationary object. If the bike has an easily removable seat, we recommend you remove the seat and take it with you,” Catalano wrote.
Since the late 1990s, HUPD has amassed nearly 14,000 bicycles in their registration system, with almost 8,700 bicycles registered in the past ten years, according to Catalano.
The Cambridge Police Department, in a summary released in August, reported an increase in bike thefts in August, with an approximately 4 percent increase from July. The Mid-Cambridge neighborhood, which includes Harvard Yard, the Inn at Harvard, and Central Square, reported the highest number of total bike thefts in August, with 12 bicycles stolen.

The Office of Student Life will await a finalized policy before imposing punishments on members of single-gender social groups, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in an interview Monday.
Though the College’s sanctions penalizing members of single-gender fraternities, sororities, and final clubs is now technically in effect for the Class of 2021, the OSL will not implement the policy on the books—which prohibits members of subject clubs from holding campus leadership positions and captaincies or receiving College endorsement for some fellowships—until a committee charged with reviewing the policy issues its final report later this month.
“We stand ready for further guidance from the faculty committee,” O’Dair said. “We will be the implementers, so we will need to look at our structures, policies, and processes. All of these things will need further development until we know what the final policy will look like.”
In the meantime, OSL administrators have been meeting with leaders of unrecognized single-gender social groups that have reached out to the office seeking guidance on how to operate in line with the current policy.
“[We] remain open to working with student groups that have been in contact with us or will be in contact with us to be in good faith compliance with the policy as it stands now,” said Christopher M. Gilbert, an OSL administrator and former Dudley House resident dean.
Since the announcement of the sanctions in May 2016, a handful of groups have made changes to their membership policies.
Currently, of Harvard’s 23 traditionally unrecognized social groups, three clubs—the Seneca, the Oak Club, and the Sab Club—and two fraternities have adopted gender neutral membership policies.
Earlier this month, the all-female Bee Club and all-male Delphic Club announced that they would share membership and the clubhouse historically owned by the Delphic on 9 Linden St, becoming the first female and male final club to merge in the wake of the sanctions.
But if the committee revising the policy accepts its preliminary recommendation—to phase out all unrecognized social clubs, co-ed or not—the changes may not be enough. Gilbert said that providing guidance to undergraduate leaders at a time when a final policy remains elusive is difficult.
“We would never want to give guidance to folks that would put them in a tough decision with all the information that we have now,” he said. “There is such a large unknown, so I have been really frank with student leaders about exactly that.”
The committee is expected to release its final report late this month. In the meantime, O’Dair said, a previous plan to pilot inter-House dining societies—touted as an alternative to participation in single-gender social groups—is stalled.
“The urgency in having conversations about social groups on campus, in a formal way generated by students, will likely follow some finality in the policy,” O’Dair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Security and communications experts joined a panel discussion on digital threats to democracy and cybersecurity at the Institute of Politics’ JFK Jr. Forum Monday night.
On the panel were Robby E. Mook and Matt Rhoades, who managed Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns, respectively, and now work together on "Defending Digital Democracy," a project at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center that looks to prevent foreign influence on future elections.
The pair kicked off the event by lamenting cyber attacks on their respective campaigns. Mook spoke about Russian government’s influence on the Clinton campaign, and Rhoades said that during Romney’s campaign, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that Chinese hackers had compromised the effort.
“What I worry the most, from a campaign standpoint... [is] having some hacker decide that they’re going to change the course of history by hacking into some rising star’s email and misconstruing something they wrote or targeting someone close to them, and having that candidate just stop on the launching pad,” Rhoades he said.
Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and expert on cyber warfare, said that countries around the world—not just the United States—are vulnerable to breaches of cyber security. He added that Russian digital influence on the 2016 election may already be irreversible.
“They now have influence over a nationalist agenda that stretches through Russia, through Germany, through France, through the United States,” he said.
Rhoades said he thought the possibility of a truly hacked election—in which individual ballots are tampered with—is even more worrying than cyber attacks. He said he fears that not even hard evidence of hacking could legitimize an election that had been interfered in to such a degree.
“In the polarized world that we live in, no one would believe the results [of a hacked election], and it would create absolute chaos,” Rhoades said. “That’s what these hackers and outside foreign entities are trying to do the most, they’re trying to create chaos.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 12, 2017, at 1:11 a.m.
If history is any indication, faculty on the committee advising the search for Harvard’s next president will be involved until the very end of the search, even reviewing lists of candidates, while the students chosen to advise the search will play a far more limited role.
With University President Drew G. Faust’s announcement in June that she will step down at the end of the academic year, Harvard has begun a nationwide search for her successor that could last months. For only the second time in the University’s 381-year history, the committee leading that search will consult groups of faculty and students to inform the search.
The search process has long been an insular one. Members of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, and the Board of Overseers meet on campus and in cities across America for months, gathering information and whittling down a list of potential candidates until they arrive on the next president.
But in 2006, Harvard announced the formation of advisory bodies to the committee searching for a new president—an unprecedented step toward formally involving students and faculty in a presidential search.  Unlike Yale, which has allowed faculty on its search committee since 1992, and Stanford and Princeton, which allow both students and faculty, Harvard opted for the formation of committees to provide official input.
The change came on the heels of criticism from former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 and other faculty who felt that their thoughts were not taken into consideration in the run-up to former University President Lawrence H. Summers’s selection. From meeting with professors and members of the Faculty Council over breakfast to extending an invitation to every department chair, the search committee that elected Drew Faust sought to take faculty concerns seriously.
Robert N. Stavins, a Kennedy School professor on the 13-member faculty advisory committee in 2007, wrote in an email that the committee was “one of several avenues through which the Corporation gathered the information it required.”
“Those of us who served on the faculty advisory committee certainly felt that we had a very adequate voice in the process. It was an intensive process, and we met regularly with members of the Corporation,” Stavins wrote. “It was also, for me at least, a very interesting and intellectually satisfying experience.”
Another faculty member of the 2007 committee, English professor Stephen J. Greenblatt, said he loved the experience and felt he had enough of a voice. The search committee met with the faculty advisory group every few weeks that fall.
And aside from meetings with department chairs and Faculty Council members, Law School professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz said the search committee reached out to individual faculty members.
“I know I generally get an email or a call for a personal assessment—what’s important and who might be the candidates,” Dershowitz said, adding that he has not yet been contacted this time around because he is an emeritus.
Dershowitz said he hopes the next president promotes freedom of speech and a diversity of viewpoints. “I hope the committee will reach wide and seek advice from lots and lots of people,” he said.
The 14-member student advisory committee, made up of students from the College and Harvard’s graduate schools, was “not involved in reviewing and commenting on particular candidates,” said committee chair Matthew J. Murray, who was at the time a joint degree candidate at the Law School and Kennedy School. “It was about what are the qualities of a candidate that the search committee should be looking for.”
The group met several times to decide how to solicit input from students at their schools. Some opted for surveys, while others spoke to student government representatives, Murray said. The findings were compiled into a report that Murray presented to the full search committee in a nearby hotel conference room.
“They probably had a relatively short list when we gave the report, but they certainly had not decided on who they were going to pick, is my guess,” Murray said. “I do believe that the committee took the input from the student group seriously and thoughtfully, that it was not just a going through the motions.”
Although he was satisfied with his voice in the process, Murray said he’d like to see a student on the actual search committee.
“That would be more input. I understand why they don’t do it,” Murray said, saying that students might be more likely to publicly discuss the confidential search.  “But from my sense I think it would be good to have somebody in the room,” he added.
The Corporation decided to maintain the same advisory committee model as last time around, and has announced the 13 members of the faculty advisory committee, which will be headed by History of Art and Architecture professor Robin Kelsey, who also serves as the FAS Dean of Arts and Humanities. A committee of staff from around the University will also advise the search.
Prominent donor Paul A. Buttenwieser ’60 said he thought naming Kelsey was a good choice for the faculty committee.
“I just think he’s a great person in many ways and I’m very glad that he’s leading the faculty advisory committee,” Buttenwieser said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Making a return to tournament fairways for the first time since NCAA Regionals in May, Harvard men’s golf opened the season competing at the Doc Gimmler.
In recent years, the Crimson has tended to start the year at the two-day invitational hosted by St. John’s at Bethpage Red Course in Farmingdale, N.Y. Further following tradition, Harvard returned as Ivy League champion for the second-straight season.
After 54 holes of play, the Crimson found itself in the fifth-place position in a field of 14 squads, one spot better than last year’s placement. Yale, the only other Ancient Eight competitor at the invite, bested Harvard by two shots to secure fourth.
Florida State brought home the first-place trophy. The Seminoles concluded play with a combined score of 827, 10 shots in front of runner-up Loyola. Third place went to UConn. Rounding out the top ten were Villanova, Rhode Island, Navy, Hartford, as well as the hosts from St. John’s.
“Generally, I’m very pleased about where we are, especially considering we are a much younger team this year,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Everyone was very strong mentally and in terms of their approach, which is most important at this time of year as we all try to sharpen our games following differing amounts of play over the summer.”
The tournament featured three rounds spread over two days, with the first two rounds taking place on Saturday and round three commencing early Sunday.
The 7,092-yard Red Course played at a par 70 for the weekend. The course features two holes that play at par five, with four par-three holes.
The Crimson modeled consistency on Saturday, firing identical scores of 283 over each round. On Sunday, the team put together a total of 285, locking in one stroke ahead of Johnson & Wales University.  This finale improved upon last year’s total of 852 by one shot.
Harvard placed third on both par-three and par-four holes. However, the team struggled on par-five holes, placing in a tie for last with Navy in that category.
Also competing over the weekend were squads from Hofstra, Towson, and Iona College.
Individually, captain Greg Royston set the pace for the Crimson. The Durban, South Africa, native finished in a sixth-place tie overall at -2. Royston performed particularly well on par fours, finishing with the second-lowest shot total on such holes at four-under-par. Junior Aurian Capart rocketed 12 spots up the leaderboard during the final round to earn a share of 17th. The individual champion was Yale’s Eion Leonard, who hit 11 strokes below the watermark.
“Given the success we have been able to achieve over the past few seasons, we certainly believe in the ability of this team moving forward,” Royston said. “The veterans on the team, including myself and Aurian, hope to do our best to use everything we learned from those who came before us to help the newcomers grow and improve their performances.”
Royston’s first-round tally of 66 matched a career low at the collegiate level. He first reached that mark one season prior at the same tournament. In that opening round, Royston finished behind only two competitors—Leonard of the Bulldogs and Connor Daly of Villanova.
Harvard sophomores Rij Patel and Ryan Rhee finished tied for 22nd and 31st, respectively. Rounding out the scoring squad and making his tournament debut was freshman Grant Fairbairn. Competing as an individual for the Crimson was freshman walk-on Peter George. Harvard came away with 33 birdies overall on the weekend, ten of which were tallied by Royston.
“Obviously we had a huge amount of leadership and talent graduate last year, so that leaves plenty of space to be filled by the underclassmen,” Rhoads said. “For them to get going right away at the first tournament gives them a lot of room to grow early on, particularly considering how difficult it has been to qualify for our traveling team in recent years.”
