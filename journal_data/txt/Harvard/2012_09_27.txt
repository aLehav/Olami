After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall semester of 2009, a group of Harvard students founded a college chapter of Students for a Just and Stable Future. The group has made it their mission to further the battle against climate change by seeking to construct a fossil free future. They have recently announced their desire that their respective universities should cease to invest in corporations involved in the extraction, production, or distribution of fossil fuels. We agree with the qualms raised by SJSF about the future of our environment and welcome their goals to increase investment in green technology. We hope that Harvard Management Company’s investments could be closer to the goals and ideals of SJSF but caution strongly against the logic and practical ramifications of divestment.
SJSF has a worthy goal, and we applaud the efforts of individuals at Harvard to take on climate change. We recognize that climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing this generation and it must be addressed in the near future. SJSF has pointed out on its website that world food prices have increased by 10 percent over the past year as a result of drought in the United States and that more of the Arctic ice sheet has melted this year than during any year previously; the situation is dire. The failure of the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change Conference to produce any concrete solutions for our degenerating climate has shown us that we cannot just rely on politicians to lead the fight against climate change.
Nonetheless, calling for universities like Harvard to divest in companies involved in the extraction or processing fossil fuels goes too far. Harvard has divested only a few times in the past, and has done so predominantly in instances of human rights abuses being linked to their investments.
What is more, these companies are often multibillion-dollar corporations, to whom divestment by universities will have little impact on their current practices. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell are the world’s largest companies by revenue, having earned $486 billion and $470 billion, respectively, in 2011. If the group’s intention is to use divestment embarrass these oil companies into ceasing to profit from fossil fuels, these efforts are all but guaranteed to be fruitless. These companies are more than capable of handling bad press; British Petroleum earned $5.3 billion in profits in 2011 despite its phenomenal catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. Several human rights groups sued Shell Oil in 1996 for human rights abuses that included allegations of collaborating in the execution of members of the Ogoni tribe in Nigeria. Shell has never accepted liability for these abuses despite paying a settlement in 2009, and continues to dominate the oil market as the second largest petroleum company in the world. Surely the divestment of funds by a few American universities will have little impact on the reputation of these so-called oil and gas “supermajors.”
It makes more sense for our university to use its expertise and resources in the field of climate science to work on tackling the core engineering problems behind our dependence on fossil fuels, which is the root of the problem.
We thank Students for a Just and Stable Future for taking on what seems to be veritable Gordian knot However, the use of divestments is unwarranted. There are many other tools SJSF can use to promote alternative energy sources and stop our reliance on fossil fuels.
UPDATE: The original version of this article incorrectly referred to the Students for a Just and Stable Future as Students for a Just and Sustainable Future. It also incorrectly said the group had been formed this year.

Harvard prides itself on its accessibility to low-income students. Indeed, Harvard’s financial aid packages are some of the best in the country. For example, students whose families make below $65,000, like 62 percent of families in the U.S., pay basically nothing for their Harvard education.
Yet Harvard’s student body is still much, much richer than the average group of American residents. As Justin Lanning ’12 noted in The Crimson last year, calculations based on information from the Harvard Financial Aid Office “come to the stunning conclusion that approximately 45.6 percent of Harvard undergraduates come from families with incomes above $200,000, placing them in the top 3.8 percent of American households. Even more shockingly, only about 4 percent of Harvard undergraduates come from the bottom quintile of U.S. incomes and a mere 17.8 percent come from the bottom three quintiles of U.S. incomes.” Despite the Financial Aid Initiative launched in 2004 and the efforts of Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, Harvard still has relatively few working- and middle-class students.
Of course, some of this disparity is due to Harvard’s admissions practices. For example, Harvard’s Admissions Office still considers legacy status in its admissions decisions, which advantages students whose parents have not just attended a university, but have attended Harvard, one of the most exclusive universities in the country (and financial aid packages weren’t nearly as generous one generation ago). Harvard also uses the SAT as a measure of aptitude, despite data suggesting that SAT scores correlate strongly with family income.
But beyond this, Harvard undoubtedly accepts more upper-class students than working-class students simply because it receives many more “strong” applications from students who have attended private schools or well-funded public schools than those who have not. Because of this, if Harvard truly wants a more socioeconomically diverse student body, it must address the structural issues that lead to well-off high school students producing better transcripts, test scores, essays, teacher recommendations, and alumni interviews than their low-income peers.
Our administrators and admissions officers do seem to believe in creating a more socioeconomically diverse Harvard. Former Harvard President Larry H. Summers, who launched the Financial Aid Initiative, declared in 2004, “We need to recognize that the most serious domestic problem in the United States today is the widening gap between the children of the rich and the children of the poor. Education is the most powerful weapon we have to address that problem.”
If Harvard’s administrators wish to reduce that gap, they cannot simply parade around statistics about the millions spent on financial aid each fiscal year. Instead, they must address structural issues in the U.S. education system that currently prevent working- and middle-class high school students from gaining admittance to “elite” universities.
For example, Harvard should stop opposing bills intended to tax universities. Rather, Harvard should either voluntarily pay taxes or increase its Payments in Lieu of Taxes to the cities of Cambridge and Boston (which are currently a small percentage of what Harvard would owe if it were not exempt from property taxes), which could be used by these cities to increase funding for public programs. Furthermore, Harvard should deploy its lobbying power and political force behind legislation that will increase funding to public schools across the country, especially in poor neighborhoods, so that schools can afford to pay teachers more and strengthen educational infrastructure.
This summer, Harvard President Drew G. Faust signed a letter urging the federal government to cut back spending on “entitlement programs” in an effort to prevent “slashing valuable investments in education.” Yet entitlement programs like the Child Care Tax Credit, food stamps, unemployment insurance, and subsidized housing are essential to Harvard’s mission of matriculating a more diverse student body; students from poor families depend on these social services as they make their way through the public education system.
Of course, even when working-class students do gain admission to Harvard, simply offering generous financial aid packages to compensate for high tuition prices is not a perfect solution. Students across the world have noted that, if education is a human right, it must be free: groups ranging from Students United for a Free CUNY to CLASSE, a student organization in Quebec, have recently demanded free public higher education. But Harvard’s tuition continues to rise at a much higher rate than inflation each year, and Harvard seems unlikely to take the lead in moving towards inexpensive higher education.
If Harvard’s administrators are committed to increasing the number of working-class and middle-class students at Harvard, they must address the structural roots of educational inequality. Of course, Harvard doesn’t seem likely to do this soon—but meanwhile, the Admissions Office should recognize that simply touting Harvard’s Net Price Calculator or even allocating a million more dollars to Harvard’s financial aid budget will not make Harvard’s undergraduate population more socioeconomically diverse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This semester, Harvard’s chapter of the regional student coalition Students For a Just and Stable Future launched a campaign to persuade the Harvard Management Company to divest from fossil fuels.
The campaign, Divest For Our Future, marks something of a last-ditch effort for the environmental movement. Activists have campaigned for decades to enact legislation that limits the use of fossil fuels, which are the greatest contributors to global warming, to little avail. Today, our domestic political climate is such that ending our dependence on fossil fuels through the legislative process is all but impossible. SJSF’s campaign for divestment represents a novel, far-reaching, and strategic approach to confronting climate change. The HMC should divest from the fossil fuel industry not only to expose the inviability of fossil fuels, but also to shift public consciousness on the urgent and systemic nature of the current climate crisis.
Virtually no disagreement exists among the scientific community about the reality of climate change, and its implications are disturbing—the Environmental Protection Agency reports that global warming will likely result in water shortages and other life-threatening crises. Historically, activists have lobbied for protective legislation, but it’s time to acknowledge that political activism simply won’t do: It is no secret that governmental policy is fraught with the interference of the enormously powerful fossil fuel lobby. Oil, gas, and electric corporations are among the top ten highest spenders on lobbying in Washington.
Nor can we expect to end climate change through individual initiative. If we are serious about addressing the climate crisis, we must slash our consumption of fossil fuels, and that means a lot more than using fluorescent light bulbs and lowering our thermostats. Put simply, it is nearly impossible to function in our culture without relying heavily on fossil fuels. The fossil fuel industry has maintained a stranglehold on our way of life not because of consumer choice, but because consumers are effectively given no other choice. Climate change should be solved not by expecting individuals to make choices that are hardly within their power to make, but by challenging the structures that are at the heart of the climate crisis.
To this end, divestment from the fossil fuel industry will expose the institutions that exacerbate climate change and withdraw economic support of a socially irresponsible industry. Harvard’s history of divestment from socially irresponsible industries such as tobacco producers sets a powerful precedent for divestment from the fossil fuel industry, which poses no less significant a threat to human wellbeing. By refusing to invest its endowment in fossil fuels, Harvard can also ensure that its investments are not used to fuel an enterprise that endangers all life on our planet.
While we are not yet accustomed to viewing climate change as a structural issue, Harvard can begin to shift public discourse on the source of and solutions to the crisis by holding fossil fuel suppliers accountable for environmental damage and interference in the democratic process.
All told, it comes as no surprise that government policy has not even begun to adequately address climate change. Legislation follows public opinion—not the other way around—and Harvard ought to take advantage of its position as an esteemed university to shift public discourse and strike at the root of climate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Running for elected office is never a waste of time.
Whether in the midst of stagnant policy change on Harvard’s campus or in a culture of gridlock on Capitol Hill, devoting your energy to political change is not a futile effort.
It’s action. And it’s admirable.
In the midst of one of the most pivotal elections of our lifetimes, there is no room to promote a culture of inaction and apathy towards our elected institutions on this campus, or anywhere. As members of the leadership of the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics, we were alarmed to see these sentiments epitomized in a recent Crimson editorial titled, “Don’t Waste Your Time,” which implored female candidates not to run for Undergraduate Council, arguing that the institution was broken and therefore worthy of abandonment.
Whether these sentiments are targeted at our own elected student body and the candidates who aim to serve our campus community, or targeted at our American democracy and the candidates who aim to serve our nation, we have to rise above this cynicism.
While the criticisms that have been directed towards the Undergraduate Council are certainly worthy of debate, there should be a clear distinction between criticizing a democratic institution and undermining the democratic process.
We should encourage motivated candidates to run for office—especially when systems are weak. When democratic institutions are struggling to bring about the results we seek, we don’t leave them to deteriorate.  We run. And we fix them. That’s how we bring about positive change. Apathy won’t bring about change, and abandonment simply can’t.
On a national level, we see repeatedly that neither Congress nor outside advocacy groups can solve problems in isolation. They work together, push each other, and bring unique capabilities to the work of democracy.  Both the Undergraduate Council and independent student initiatives are vital to change at Harvard. We need dedicated students to work in both.
And yes, that includes women.
As former Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill once said, “All politics is local.” To promote an ethos on Harvard’s campus that devalues public service and the efforts of a woman candidate to serve her community and achieve greater parity in leadership has deleterious implications.
At an institution that has a history of producing world leaders such as John F. Kennedy ’40, the namesake of our Institute and a president who inspired generations to dedicate themselves to public service, the dialogue we promote on this campus matters.
It matters if we want able and motivated candidates to run for the Undergraduate Council. It matters if we want to see change in our community, our dining halls, our homes, and our classrooms. It matters if we want this change to come from the only governing body that we all have a voice in.
And it matters if we want to promote a culture in which everyone—man and woman alike—is encouraged to engage in their democracy.
In a poll released earlier this year through Harvard Public Opinion Project at the Institute of Politics, we found that 79 percent of Americans aged 18-29 don’t consider themselves to be politically active. As members and future leaders of the Millennial Generation, that is a statistic we shouldn’t settle for. We can’t.
That’s why we need to encourage rhetoric on campus that acknowledges the power and potential of political action. If you aren’t happy with what the Undergraduate Council is doing or isn’t doing, do something about it. Doing nothing won’t get us anywhere, and leaving the job to independent initiatives on campus neglects the role that the Undergraduate Council plays as your institutionally sanctioned democratic voice.
With just over a month left before we elect the President of the United States and not much longer before we elect the next President of the Undergraduate Council, you face a choice.
You can listen to a rhetoric of apathy. You can engage in a culture of inaction.
To that, we say: Don’t waste your time.
Do something: Vote.
Or better yet: Run.
Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, Julia B. Konrad ’13, and Victoria E. Wenger ’14 are members of the Student Advisory Committee at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics and alumna of the IOP’s Women’s Initiative in Leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
The legal status of hate crime laws is far from “questionable” or in “tricky legal waters” as Sarah Siskind asserts in her article “It’s a Love-Hate Crime Relationship,” September 21, 2012.
The United States Supreme Court upheld enhanced sentences for bias-inspired criminal acts back in 1993 when it unanimously recognized that these crimes inflict greater individual and societal harm and are consistent with the Constitution.
The Matthew Shepard/James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which formed the basis for the Ohio convictions that Siskind references in her article, does not create special rights for different classes of victims nor does not it punish free thought. Hate crime laws punish the actions of individuals whose violent acts were motivated by their hatred. When an individual or group of people commits a crime based on biased beliefs and intentionally targets another for violence, the law is triggered.
It is too simple to characterize “hate” as the basis for all crimes. Hate violence is intentional, targeted and designed to send a message of intimidation.  The Ohio victims were targeted solely because of their religious practice and the violent act of cutting their beards was intended to send a message.
The law does not carve out, nor should it, an exception when the victim and perpetrator are of the same religion or race. Police, prosecutors and jurors are focused on motive. The Ohio jury was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that religion formed the basis of the defendants’ actions and reached a verdict on that basis.
America is a unique country where building a single nation out of many diverse ways of life requires a strong set of laws making clear that attempts to divide us by intimidation will not be taken lightly. Hate crime laws help fill that purpose.

 
Sincerely,

Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, sits in his crimson-walled office, wearing a black suit and royal purple shirt. Walton was appointed in April 2012 to the position previously held by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes. Tributes to his sports fanaticism decorate his office: A basketball signed by Tommy Amaker sits atop one of the bookshelves.  FM munched on some peanut M&M’s with Walton, and talked about Memorial Church air conditioners, tailgates at Sparks House and his 3-month-old son Baldwin.
1. Fifteen Minutes: Again, congratulations on the new position! A few months into your duties as Pusey Minister, do you finally feel that you have settled into this new role?
Jonathan L. Walton: I’m learning that this is a marathon, not a sprint, and I’m trying to keep that in mind. I’m having a wonderful time, and the people and the community have been so supportive. And I think that’s made all the difference.
2. FM: What psalm do you think would be most appropriate to describe your current state of mind as Minister?
JLW: “Psalm 121.” It’s the psalm that says “I would look to the hills from whence cometh my help. All of my help comes from the Lord.”
3. FM: What is its significance for you?
JLW: My prayer life has been enriched by being in this position. I go to bed every night just thankful for all that I’ve been given. So I’ve really been looking to the Lord both for sustenance and in appreciation.
4. FM: Surely there have been some surprises along the way—what have you encountered that you didn’t expect when you accepted the position?
JLW: I’ve been surprised by how busy everyone is at this University, waking up every day and looking at my calendar and seeing that I’m running from meeting to meeting. I thought I was busy before as a member of the faculty, and I thought I was busy if I couldn’t get three hours of reading in or two hours of writing. Now if I have 15 minutes to take a break, that would be a surprise.
5. FM: With such little time on your hands, what do you do for fun?
JLW: I’m an avid sports fan, and I’m an avid Harvard fan. For the past couple of years here, I’ve been a season ticket holder for the football games, the basketball games, and the women’s volleyball games. I’m a huge women’s volleyball fan here at Harvard. And so that’s what I do. Every Saturday of home games, you’ll find me over at the stadium cheering on the Crimson. You’ll find me Sunday afternoons sitting in front of the TV cheering for the Atlanta Falcons.
6. FM: Is that something that you and your family do together?
JLW: We’re all huge sports fans: Cecily, my wife, the twins, and even little Baldwin—my baby three-month-old—he has a little Harvard t-shirt. Now that we’re getting settled, in the next few weeks—for the football games and leading up to basketball—we’re going to start tailgating at Sparks House.
7. FM: Sounds like a good time. I imagine that you must be a very proud father of your new little one.
JLW: He’s beautiful. Beautiful. That’s all I can say. We’re blessed. We’re looking forward to raising him and the older kids in this wonderful community.
8. FM: So you moved into Sparks House over Labor Day weekend—how has the adjustment been? Do you miss Lowell?
JLW: Oh, of course we miss Lowell. The kids are begging every night at dinner time to go back to the dining hall. Not only are they upset with my cooking, but they really miss the fellowship with students over at Lowell. So, we’ve tried to head over and dine with some of the students at least once a week.
9. FM: What do you think of the new paint job at Sparks House?
JLW: I’m happy with it. The Cambridge Historical Society wanted to restore its original color and make it historically appropriate. And I think that it blends in perfectly with the community. I think it represents, you know, my family’s personality: We just want to blend in and be part of the community.
10. FM: Between the paint job and the ending of the Wednesday Tea tradition that Gomes had started as Pusey Minister, do you think that Gomes’ s legacy on the Harvard campus has been diminished? Some people have said that now that they don’t see the yellow, they feel as if Gomes is really gone.
JLW: Gomes was so much more than a canary yellow paint job. His words of wisdom, his many publications, all of the students that he touched, all of the fond memories that people have of his sense of humor—that’s who Peter Gomes was. That’s his legacy. So a canary yellow paint job and a weekly tea—all of those things were part of him, but they did not “represent” him to this community. It was his intellectual and spiritual legacy, not this kind of aesthetic façade.
11. FM: Was that, then, the motivation behind creating MemChurch Café—as a sort of replacement for Wednesday Tea? Has there been a strong turnout now that it’s coming out of its incipient weeks?
JLW: I wouldn’t say that MemChurch Café is replacing weekly tea. I think weekly tea, from my understanding at least, kind of ran its course even before my appointment. So much of that was bound up with Peter’s hospitality and his home and his charisma. So, the weekly tea belonged to him. When he was taken out of the mix, as I was told, numbers really dropped. What we’re trying to do here now is to find new exciting and creative ways to create community, and Memorial Church Café just happens to be one of them. Just as I said earlier, I hope one of those things is our regular tailgates at Sparks House. And I think that’s something that’s more representative of my family. So I never want to think of things as “we’re replacing something that was before,” but rather that we are a living organism and we develop and change and grow.
12. FM:  Of these new and exciting developments, what has been your favorite part of the job so far?
JLW: The people that I’m able to meet. I’ve been on this campus for three years, and in a week I’ve probably met more members of the Harvard community than in the previous two years. That’s really exciting because there are just such cool, smart people here. I find that I have to leave earlier now for meetings because I just want to stay and talk to everybody. To hear about where students come from, what they’re majoring in, what activities they’re involved in—that’s been the best part for me.
13. FM: What do you hope to accomplish over the course of your freshman year leading Memorial Church?
JLW: Letting everybody know that everyone may not belong to Memorial Church, but Memorial Church belongs to everyone. We belong to you, no matter who you are, no matter your religion, no matter your concentration. We may not be your cup of tea on Sunday morning, but hopefully, whether it’s for morning prayers or other activities that we hold during the week, this is a place where people can come, and recharge, and become a part of a larger community.
14. FM: You seem so excited to be here, how do you maintain such exuberance?
JLW: You know, I’ve never understood Christians who say they have the joy of Jesus and the love of God in their souls, and yet they always look like they’ve been sucking on a lemon. Somehow, spiritual depth takes on a somber tone. I don’t get that. I wake up every morning excited and happy about the opportunities that I have had and that God has provided me with. Why wouldn’t I be smiling?
15. FM: By the end of your time as Pusey Minister, what sort of legacy will you hope to have left?
JLW: For one, I told President Faust that I think I will be a success here if we are able to name the Jonathan L. Walton Memorial Air Conditioner so that students will not have to sit through another baccalaureate exercise sweating through their robes. That will be a success. But, also, at the end of the day—whenever my time comes—if people would just say, “he cared about us, he cared about students, he cared about their well-being.” If that’s on my tombstone—“He Cared.”—I would be happy.

Zadie Smith, author of “White Teeth” and “On Beauty,” visited the Cambridge Public Library last week to read from her new book, “NW.” A half hour before Smith was slated to speak, the library staff was shepherding the overflowing crowd into a second room from which they could watch the event live on screen. Several floors above the chaos, in an office at the end of a labyrinthine corridor, Smith sat down with FM.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You said recently that you consider “NW” to be the first book that you’ve written as an adult. And it’s stylistically very different from your previous novels. Could you tell me anything about where you think you’re moving to—or maybe away from—as a writer?
Zadie Smith: I don’t know. I don’t really think of it that way. The funny thing is, when I was writing it I didn’t think of it as that different. You know, when you’re within your own consciousness and your own mind, it’s all you. So I didn’t see it as such a different approach. And actually I noticed when I read it out loud, people think it sounds just like my other fiction. The way I think of it, the way I read it, it’s quite naturalistic but people are sometimes thrown—I’m surprised at how much…the way things look on a page makes so much of a difference to the way people read. So I don’t think I’m moving away from anything. To me, each novel is quite different…. “The Autograph Man” isn’t much like “White Teeth,” so they’re all different. I try and interest myself, which I guess means moving forward or backward or I don’t know what direction, but moving, anyway. I can’t imagine writing the same thing over and over.
2. FM: In a 2011 interview in Harper’s Magazine, you spoke about how you had ti actually walk around Harlem to understand and appreciate the prose in “Harlem is Nowhere,” by Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts. You’ve written primarily about Northwest London but you’re now living part-time in New York, and you were here in Cambridge for a while. Do you think that had any effect on your writing?
ZS: Yes, I mean, place does mean a lot to me one way or another. I wanted to try and be honest to what my sense of living in a city is like—living in a modern city. So that’s part of the reason for, I suppose, the fragmentation or the disconnection in parts of the novel. Also, because I like the idea of gaps. I find it quite oppressive, when I’m reading, to have every single detail filled in, as if your imagination is kind of colonized by this other person, the writer. I like to have a bit of space. And you know, to survive in Northwest London or any busy city, you have to do quite a bit of improvising—you know, quite a lot of quick moves. I wanted to try and replicate that. And Sharifa does such a good job of that in her Harlem book; there is a kind of dreamy atmosphere in Harlem, and a sense of constant intrusion of the past on the present. Reading it, I understood it, but when I was physically moving through Harlem, I really saw how accurate she’d been to the atmosphere of the place.
3. FM: In your writing, you talk about families as collective entities. There’s a line in “NW” where you refer to the character of the Caldwell family with the phrase, “a Caldwell assumption.” Does family define identity for you? Where does this pattern come from?
ZS: I suppose I think of families as mini-societies, you know: repressive, sometimes dictatorial, hard to live in, sometimes very freeing. Some families are very healthy. But most families, I think we can all agree, are not particularly healthy. It’s not a very healthy structure, just because you’re forced to live with people that you really don’t know from Adam. It’s a kind of accident that you’re thrown into a living arrangement with them. So that situation always strikes me as quite comic. Obviously it can have tragic aspects in its extreme manifestations, but for most people, the pain of family is quite funny. I have an example: Today I was on the train and there was a woman about 65 years old or 70 phoning all her various siblings to discuss what was going to be done about mother, for a series of arguments with the various siblings. It was very political. It was like watching a kind of, you know, international negotiation. She would phone and say to Sharon, “I’m not trying to suggest we do this, but we might do this.” She’d phone Ian, and then finally, toward the end of the call, I was really wondering, who was this ogre mother? Then she phoned [her] mother, who was obviously like 98, and I heard her say to her mother, “Yes, Mom. Yes, Mom. Well, you’re going to your final, most important journey, Mom.” It was awful, but you know, it takes a lot of negotiation to live in a family.... And everyone keeps on saying that they love each other, but there are all kinds of anxieties and envy and stress underneath the surface. I think that’s perfectly normal, but it just seems to me more interesting than writing about romantic love, for example.
4. FM: Changing directions a bit, you recently wrote a profile of Jay-Z in The New York Times Magazine, and you’ve mentioned music in your writing. What’s your taste in music?
ZS: Well, I am a long-term hip-hop fan, and then apart from that, I like show tunes, I suppose. Somebody said in my college yearbook that I had the worst taste in music known to man. Maybe that’s true. I like a lot of thirties, forties musicals and jazz, a lot of torch singers, a lot of black women singers—vocalists—I guess that’s what I’m interested in, and hip-hop. So voice, I guess, is what connects all of them. I like people with voices. I don’t have much time for indie rock. It’s not the way I was brought up. So I like black music, I suppose, in all its variation.
5. FM: You wanted to be an actress in musicals when you were very young.
ZS: When I was a very small child, the same way that people want to be firemen or astronauts. It wasn’t really a serious ambition. But that’s what I did, you know, it was my hobby as a child. I sang and danced, that was my thing.
6. FM: And now you’re teaching at NYU.
ZS: I teach at NYU, yes, I do. Only for one semester a year, so it’s quite low-key, in its way.
7. FM: Has that made you think about writing any differently? Are you teaching creative writing?
ZS: I teach in the Creative Writing department, but I actually teach literature. I teach novels, and my students write me essays. I’m aware that they want to write fiction, but we don’t really discuss that or go into it. I don’t read their fiction, and they’d never give it to me—only because that’s the way I was taught. I never took a creative writing course, I took an English degree. So as far as I’m concerned, that’s the most useful route to writing. I can only teach what I know. I don’t know how to do a workshop. I have no experience of that kind of thing, so I don’t do it.
8. FM: You have mentioned that you thought, when people were reading your novel “On Beauty,” they might think, “Oh, she came from an upper-middle class family in a university town,” which is not what your experience was like at all.
ZS: A lot of people do assume that. I didn’t realize that until [my book] came out. I’ve read lots of reviews which took it as writ that this was my experience, which was funny. But nobody thought I was a Jewish-Chinese man when I wrote “The Autograph Man.” They were convinced by Zora [a character in “On Beauty”], I guess. No, it couldn’t have been further from my own family and my own experience, but it was fun to write for that reason. It was fun to imagine what it would be like to come from an intellectual family. But it really just came from the realization that when I was a kid I was so curious about those kind of families, because you always thought, “Well, if I was a writer in a family like that, I could sit at the breakfast table discussing my novel with my father. Wouldn’t that be interesting?” And of course you meet people who are born in that situation, and they tell you it’s living hell. I found that very illuminating. I never understood that a family of that kind would have its own difficulties. As a child I didn’t realize it at all.
9. FM: What was your experience like coming to Cambridge after having a working class upbringing?ZS: My Cambridge or your Cambridge?FM: Your Cambridge.
ZS: It was a shock. I was one of about three black girls, I think—at least that I ever saw.
[A booming loudspeaker announcement silences Smith: “Attention! Now is the time to go to L2 if you have a blue ticket. We will be closing the door to the auditorium in approximately four minutes. If you’re holding a blue ticket, to ensure your seat for Zadie Smith, please come straight to L2 now. Thank you.”]
ZS: What was I saying? Oh, Cambridge. I know those three black girls, actually. Naomie Harris was one of them, the actress; a girl called Danielle Allen, who became Dean [of the Division of Humanities] of [the University of] Chicago. A lot of the black girls I knew who went there said that they really hated it and found it very stressful, and I can completely comprehend that feeling. Cambridge is not just one university, it’s a series of colleges, and they have quite different characters. I think if I’d gone to Trinity or John—or in fact, practically any other college in Cambridge—I would have found it very painful and hard, but it happened that I was advised—correctly advised—to go to King’s, and King’s is a college the intake of which is mostly North London kids—not from my background, Jewish kids, lower-class kids, but kids that I had some familiarity with. I knew them from the streets, I knew them from parties. I was familiar with those kids. So it wasn’t so strange to me, because they were London kids, so I knew what I was dealing with.
10. FM: The characters in your books are from all sorts of backgrounds. It seems like you’ve spent a lot of time getting to know people.
ZS: Well, in my line of work it’s hard not to meet a lot of people, one way or another, and they tend to be from different parts of the world. Also because, you know, your life moves forward, but where you came from stays the same. So you’re constantly involved in these kind of juxtapositions.… A lot of my life, when I’m back in London, it’s very the same. So I feel like I’m still in touch with a lot of what I came from. But obviously, living in Manhattan is a long way away—a different culture entirely. But that’s always been my life. Straddling things.

It’s safe to assume that most Harvard students want to leave a mark in the books. This week, FM emailed professors to find out which artistic work in their field they think most shaped history. Please note: If you’re in a class with one of these professors, we just figured out your final paper topic.
Amanda J. Claybaugh, Professor of English, gave us two picks: “Well, the obvious choice is ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’ which persuaded northern readers to advocate for the end of slavery. But I’m guessing everyone else will have already chosen that one, so I’ll say ‘Gone With the Wind,’ the movie, which continues to shape how people think about the Reconstruction period even today: people watch the film for its compelling love story, and, in the process, they absorb a depiction of the Confederacy as a heroic Lost Cause and, much worse, of Reconstruction as a time when corrupt carpetbaggers oppressed noble southern whites and uppity former slaves sexually threatened white women.”
Suzanne P. Blier, Allen Whitehill Clowes Professor of Fine Arts and Professor of African and African American Studies, opted for an African sculpture: “The famous head of Olokun (the goddess of trade and the sea), a c.1300 C.E. cast bronze head from the city-state of Ife in what is today Nigeria. This extraordinary work, first discovered and publicized by the German anthropologist Leo Frobenius, not only was featured in publicity for the 1977 FESTAC (an international festival of Black arts and culture), hosted by Nigeria, but also in the memoir by Nobel Prize winner, Wole Soyinka, ‘You Must Set Forth at Dawn.’”
Matthew B. Kaiser, Associate Professor of English, took a turn for the sciences: “Charles Darwin’s ‘The Origin of Species.’ Though it is not a work of literature per se, it is the Victorian text that had the most profound historical impact, not only because it redefined what it means to be human, but because it dramatically rewrote human history, conflated biology in the popular imagination with historical change itself.”
Richard Beaudoin, Preceptor in Music, couldn’t choose a single work: “Once, while a student London, I heard Sir Georg Solti (whose conducting scores were just donated to Harvard’s Loeb Music Library) being interviewed by the BBC before his conducting of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Beethoven’s Ninth is often spoken about as the most historically important work in the Western Canon, and the interviewer was trying to get Solti to say the same. And I recall Solti replying that, on the contrary, there were hundreds of works, some large and some small, that had enormous impact on the history of music. And that to try and single out one work was to miss the point, both of music and of history.”

To everything there is a season. For the Harvard college community, the cooling last days of September coincides with the first days of punch, typically calling for a surge of bow ties and formal wear on campus. However, this fall, rumors of a concerted HUPD and Cambridge Police crackdown have caused several student groups and final clubs to cancel events, leaving many students without a weekend outlet. At a place like Harvard—where tradition is practically sacred—a threat to the classic rituals of 3p.m. suit-wearing and theme parties is a serious concern.
Clearly, this situation calls for expert attention.
Re-enter the Harvard Hoochies, the infamous “BU Biddies who hooched and husband hunted at Harvard Final Clubs.” Despite graduation and their move to New York, the girls remain true to their roots (Mount Auburn Street), and their principles (never sorry). Fifteen Minutes caught up with the Hoochies via email, and learned that, while seasons pass and biddies come and go, the sass is here to stay.
Fifteen Minutes: When the police are threatening parties, what's a biddie to do?
Harvard Hoochies: Leave, try another final club, or go to a party in one of the Houses. Adams is great because it has large rooms. Kirkland is great because you can waft in the spirit of Zuckerberg.
FM: Any suggestions on how to save a night?
HH: Keep drinking–always. Don’t drunk eat–ever. And finally, sext like you mean it.
FM: If the Hoochies aren't around, who can save Harvard nightlife?
HH: Sluts in bandage skirts are everywhere.
FM: When the party shuts down, is there any hope for a Random Ugly Harvard Girl (RUHG)?
HH: Yes! If a party is shut down, Harvard bros are less likely to meet a BU biddie that night. Therefore, it’s more likely that they’ll be calling on the Harvard girl they hook up with during the week. Maybe RUHGs are behind the parties getting shut down.
FM: To make matters worse, many athletes are in hot water for the Introduction to Congress cheating allegations. Suggestions for what will keep Harvard athletes going strong?
HH: Let’s hope none of the athletes eat their feelings over this. No one likes a chunky guy in spandex.
FM: With fewer athletes on campus, would you ever consider looking at different Harvard groups/clubs for “man-meat”?
HH: We already stalk all of them….
FM: And finally, concerning your graduation: Can we expect to see you all back for a return visit?
HH: See you in the Square for Head Of The Charles and Harvard-Yale.

With Cambridge Police hot on the trail of now-illicit bacchanals, students require musical catharsis. For those of you whose social lives are under threat from The Man, we present a playlist featuring artists who share your pain.
1. “Fuck tha Police” by N.W.A
The crown jewel of protest songs. Understandably, this ballad has becomea rallying cry for the Compton youth, and, maybe a little more surprisingly, the Crimson youth as well. Want people to think you have street cred? Then get caught reciting a line from this song. We suggest “Beat a police out of shape / And when I’m finished, bring the yellow tape.”
2. “Fuck the Police” by Mellowhype
Inspired by N.W.A.’s song of the same name released 20 years prior, Mellowhype’s take starts with the typical anticop rhetoric but takes a plunge toward the absurd when they start rapping about raping female cops. The song is filled with lyrical gems, including “Kidnap a detective, tie his ass to a cross.”
3. “Police On My Back” by The Clash
Next to hip hop, no genre loves to hate the establishment more than punk rock—cue the Clash. This is one to blast the next time you’re fleeing from the Phoenix or springing from the Spee—Joe Strummer knows how it feels to have the police on yo’ case, wondering what you’ve done to deserve it.
4. “Freedom for a Policeman” by Chad VanGaalen
On the other hand, if the sociology concentrator/bleeding heart in you has ever worried that traditional power structures might be oppressing the oppressors, Canadian indie rocker Chad Van-Gaalen’s got you covered. With such plaintive lyrics as “Policeman, you’ve become such a drag / Why won’t you be our friend / And drop your gun in hand?,” you’re sure to appeal to the marshmallow interior beneath that cold authoritarian veneer.
5. “They Don’t Care About Us” by Michael Jackson
This song is characteristic of Michael Jackson’s life: inspiring, provocative,and very, very controversial. Originally intended to be a rally against police brutality, the song includes ambiguous lyrics such as “Jew me, sue me / Everybody dome”—we’ll let you figure that one out.
6. “Every Step You Take” by The Police
What’s creepier than a band called The Police declaring they’re following every step you take? Answer: The Cambridge police doing it in real life.

For the average college student, mornings can be one of the trickiest and most frustrating times of day. If you happen to be awake between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 a.m., there is an 85 percent chance that you are highly annoyed with the behavior of someone else who is awake between those hours as well (sleepers tend not to cause trouble). In order to avoid early-morning hatred for friends, blockmates, and not-so-innocent bystanders, you should first identify the type of riser with whom you are interacting and proceed to practic  proper morning etiquette accordingly. At a time when it is so very easy to offend, it is essential to proceed with extreme caution.
 
Energy Levels
Morning liveliness is a touchy subject. For those of you who wake up perfectly full of vim, ready to chatter your way into te day, we commend you. However, please know that your chipperness, while admirable, is wildly frustrating to essentially everyone else. Attempt to gauge the levels of conversation that seem appropriate. Should you be alone in your room with someone of the same morning tendency, prattle away. But, do make sure to know your audience. Some of the less-chipper among us are perfectly happy to allow you to talk at us while we slowly chomp our cereal, provided at least 50 percent of the responses are adequately met by a meaningful grunt. Others cannot abide even this amount of exertion, and will make it fairly obvious through the employment of so-called “death stares” and, sometimes, “bitch faces.”
As for the most common form of morning conversations, you must think of them as something like a small, fragile bird: Bring up the wrong topic, get overly excited, or make any sudden movements, and these subjects will shut down or play dead. Gentle treatment will result in the gradual strengthening of their conversational means; by the end of breakfast, they may be as chipper as yourself, but the time this requires will depend on the subject.
For those on the other side of this conundrum, and the opposite end of the table, be aware that the giddiness you feel when encountering a small puppy for the first time roughly approximates how “morning people” awake each morning. Be sympathetic. Such enthusiasm is difficult to contain. While it may be an honest expression of your emotions, staring down friends and close acquaintances is not a socially acceptable form of behavior. If you are not yet physically in control of your face, warn others the day before to avoid unnecessary offence. Do not overextend yourself, but do try to use words, at least occasionally.
Noise Levels
Ah, the sounds of the morning: The birds tweet sweetly, soft whistles of wind rustle the fall leaves, and a few friendly dogs offer up their barks. While it’s tempting to add your own playlist of death-metal bands or loudly-bellowed bars of an opera libretto to the symphony of the morning, please refrain. Morning sounds should be enjoyable to all, and unnoticeable to those aslumber. Moreover, some sounds should not be shared to anyone at any point in the day. To the couples who refuse to let the break of day separate the course of love, you have our full respect and Harvard singles’ collective envy. However, no one should be awakened by the not-so-neighborly cries of “Ohhhhh Tommmm...” or “Yeah, baby. Yeeeeaaah!” It’s more than aesthetically jarring; it’s rude. Please be cognizant that four walls don’t rule out an unwitting audience and adjust the volume of your sweet music accordingly. The walls are thin, the night is long.
As concerns actual music: This is a sensitive issue, but a good rule of thumb is to assume that the mornings are not the best time to impress upon your neighbors your excellent music taste or vocal abilities. While you may one day tempt the girl from across the hall into your room with the irresistible strains of  80s German synth-rock, attempting this in the morning will likely have the opposite of the intended effect. Harvardians with ample singing ability (and especially those without), be aware that your songs of praise may not be so praiseworthy in the eyes of your neighbors in the early hours.
For those who hold the mornings to be a sacred and meditative time, and particularly for those who practice alternative forms of spirituality—you have our deep admiration. But, a word of caution for morning practices that might involve loud circular breathing patterns, worrisome-wheeze-sounding exhales, or Gregorian Chants: Care of the soul is wonderful. Psychological damage inflicted upon others is not.

“That Place Next To Daedalus” died August, 2012 in its home on Mt. Auburn St. It was four years old.
It took weeks for the untimely death to be discovered by Quincy residents from their dining hall window and even longer for drunk students looking for late-night snacks and electrolytes at Tommy’s Value to notice, too. Eventually, two people lacking in conversation topics reported to their peers, “Did you hear about what’s going on at ‘That Place On Mt. Auburn That Looked Alright’?” They received blank stares in return.
The little restaurant that couldn’t, Tràta was many things to many people—restaurant, bar, place to walk past on a trip to Dunster. It will be remembered by some as the place they went to freshman year with their parents before they heard about Cambridge 1, by others as the place they thought about going to with their parents freshman year before they went to Cambridge 1, and by seven people as the best restaurant in Harvard Square.
Like a dependable friend, “You Know, That Italian-Slash-Pizza Place? No, Not Otto But The Sit Down Place That Starts With A ‘T’”, was always there for the four Harvard students who needed it. Among Tràta’s achievements was its role as a pioneer in the field of pulled pork and blue cheese pizza.
True to a misguided translation of its name in Spanish, if at first you don’t succeed, Tràta again.
Tràta is survived by The Boathouse.

I am too cool for Tumblr. Even so, it’s hard to resist the impulse to collect all the awesome stuff I come across in my Internet perambulations. Herein lies the dilemma: If I’m too cool for Tumblr, the next logical step might be to turn to Pinterest or a similar service, but because I’m too cool for Tumblr, then I’m ipso facto too cool for Pinterest. What’s an intellectual polyglot like me to do these days?
The answer lies, I think, in a physical artifact: the commonplace book. Just about nobody knows what these are ca. 2012—that’s why they’re cool, of course—but they were pretty big back in the days of horse-driven carriages and Jane Austen, when she wasn’t dead yet. Many people use social media today basically the same way people used to use commonplace books, which were essentially scrapbooks for collecting the turns of phrase, lines of dialogue, nifty quotes, and whatever else inspired and resonated with them. Cool stuff.
Not sold yet? Think about how much more solid and tactilely pleasing a book is than a Tumblr or Pinterest. A hypothetical scene: Your friend says, “Hey, you should check out my [generic social media apparatus].” Nonplussed, you silently—ominously—remove an elephantine, gilt-edged leather bound tome from your otherwise impoverished shelf across the room and drop it on his or her Macbook. Books are more better than Tumblrs, Q.E.D.
Plus, all the coolest people used commonplace books: Mark Twain, Darwin’s grandpa, 19th-c. Harvard undergrads (our ancestors!), and that guy who wrote “Paradise Lost”—Tom Milton or something. Who uses Tumblr? Zooey Deschanel, adolescent girls who want to be Zooey Deschanel, college girls who are secretly deep down still adolescent girls who want to be Zooey Deschanel, et al.
The only thing that Tumblr-ites have over commonplace folk is the whole digital sharing thing. Luckily, we have scanners now so you can upload pages of your book to share with the world. I acknowledge, however, that there does exist another pressing argument against reverting to analog, viz., it’s pretty tough to include videos and .gifs in your book. My riposte: You could always make a flipbook.
It’s a win-win situation: Ditch the Tumblr. And if that doesn’t work out, at least you’ll finally have something to blog about.

 A note to my readers who I recently found out may or may not exist:
Good day, and a merry weather to you! You may notice that this week’s last week’s weather is strikingly similar to last week’s last week’s weather. This is not an error; the weather has just been boring and routine for this week’s and last week’s last week’s weather, respectively. Get those Chinese weather-influencing salt-cannons ready, we’re hoping for some good stuff in next week’s last week’s weather.
Signed, Weathermen
This week in last week’s weather, we talk about the weather from last week: A real meteorologist predicted that this week’s weather would be “mostly pleasant.” I’ve only been able to apply that description to one thing in my life: getting kicked in the testicles by my childhood crush, Becky “The Whore” Banini. I heard she recently developed a Xanax addiction. If I had any sensation left in my groin, I’m sure it would feel like justice. Anyway, in between lapses of consciousness and “time commitments,” I may have noticed the sun once or twice this week. It seemed nice—like the gentle caress of an innocent child, its arm reaching out in sub-lethal doses of cosmic radiation as atoms explode in radiant death at the heart of the sun. It was also a good week to go running by the Charles, if you’re into that kind of thing. A “friend” asked me to jog to MIT with him on Tuesday. I said, “Okay, if the weather is good.” It was. I hate running.
 Aggregate score: 5 out of 10.

Harvard was missing something. Surrounded by peers at the annual Latino Ivy League Conference in Ithaca last November, Daniel J. Artiga ’15 came to this realization: As students active in the Latino community described the resources provided on their respective campuses, he had little to add. “Yale spoke, Brown spoke, they all had something great to say,” he remembers. But then it was Harvard’s turn. “The other delegates and I mentioned how it would be awkward beforehand, because we didn’t have a lot to say,” recalled Artiga, vice president of the Latino Men’s Collective. “But it didn’t hit me until I was actually sitting in a room listening to other students bragging about how well their Latino community is treated—and how ours is, I feel, neglected.”
Harvard prides itself on being at the vanguard of new inquiry. Yet when it comes to the study and support of the nation’s—and higher education’s—fastest-growing demographic, some students and professors believe that Harvard is falling behind.
“Spanish was spoken in many parts of what’s now the United States long before English was spoken,” says Professor David Carrasco, a Professor of Latin American Studies at the Divinity School with a joint appointment in Anthropology. Carrasco is Mexican-American and has been studying and teaching about Latinos and Latin America for years. A friendly, intense man with a jovial voice that switches effortlessly from English to Spanish as students stop by his office, he says that some histories of our nation just don’t get taught.
“We’re not trying to say this here because we want to raise up the ethnicity of Spanish speakers,” he clarifies. “It’s just a historical fact.”
Latinos are part of the nation’s past. They are part of Harvard’s past, too. They are a vibrant and undeniable part of its present. And the Latino population is growing. Fast.
Research on this swelling demographic and its impact is expanding at a rate similar to the population’s growth. And for good reason: The 2011 U.S. Census Bureau reports that the Hispanic population has almost doubled in size over the past decade. The nation’s largest ethnic minority, it accounts for 16.7 percent of the population—a number expected to reach 30 percent by 2050. And Latino students make up 11.2 percent of admitted students for the class of 2016.
Many of Harvard’s peer institutions offer either specific programs for scholarship of Latinos or cultural centers for their students. Students at Yale can go to La Casa Cultural, a cultural center founded in 1977. Stanford’s El Centro Chicano was established in 1978. Studying at Cornell? Minor in the Latino Studies Program.
Harvard has no equivalent.
“I’m struggling to find the resources and opportunities to explore my culture,” says Victor M. Flores Jr. ’13, who has been involved with College Latino student groups since he was a freshman. “There are still groups of color on campus that feel like learning about their culture and their communities and their history, and it’s difficult to access,” he says.
Efforts to bring such resources to Harvard, including attempts to create a center where students can have access to researchers and resources related to the Latino experience, stretch back approximately 40 years. This past April, Michael J. Trejo, a joint Kennedy and Business School student and the president and co-founder of the Harvard Latino Student Alliance (HLSA), published an op-ed in The Crimson, once again bringing demands for a Latino Studies Center to the fore.
Beyond drawing attention to the need for a more focused Latino Studies program, Trejo’s op-ed revitalized discussion of a student demographic that, while expanding, is—according to many of its members—talked about too little.
Visions for such a center at Harvard range from a social space where Latino student groups can meet and hold events, to a center or institute for scholarship and research opportunities, to a program of academic study within the College. The most cohesive plans embrace them all: a physical space where students and scholars can meet to discuss and disperse funds for the research and study of Latinos, accompanied by curricular offerings for College students.
Resistance to establishing a Latino Cultural Center is in keeping with Harvard’s long-standing policy on how it chooses to support ethnic and cultural student groups. With the exception of the Harvard University Native American Program, a University-funded office and space dedicated to supporting and educating about Harvard’s Native American community, no cultural student groups on campus have University-allocated centers. While this is true, many advocates of Latino Studies and of a Latino Studies Center laud the work done by the Department of African and African American studies, and the W.E.B. DuBois Institute, as models for what such resources might look like.
With the expansion of the Committee on Ethnic Studies—which, through curricular offerings and collaboration with student groups, offers support for those interested in the study of Latinos both in and outside the classroom—students and professors believe that Harvard is heading in the right direction.
Yet they worry that it’s not getting there fast enough.
¿QUE SIGNIFICA SER LATINO?
“It’s a sense of family, family ties, a kind of relationship to a whole way of expressing your interest, your emotion, yourself generally. And there’s not a small portion of nostalgia for a culture that you partly represent.” —Diana Sorensen, Dean of Arts and Humanities
“It’s a way of living.... Everything has this sort of umph.” —Maria Barragan-Santana ’14
Hispanic. Latino(a). Chicano(a): n. a human being struggling to unify the international part of her identity with the other part, domestic.Trejo provides this definition while sitting in the Kennedy School’s Belfer Building.
Trejo is half-Mexican—his Spanish-speaking heritage reaches back four generations, to when his great-grandfather moved to the barrios of Phoenix, Ariz., where he worked as a tailor.
“Latino is a self-identified ethnicity, something you have to actively choose to be,” he says.
Nelida Garcia ’14 always identified herself as Mexican—until she went to Mexico when she was 12 years old.
“They were like, you’re not Mexican, you’re American, and for me that was a shock,” says Garcia, who was born in Chicago. “I’m neither from here nor from there—it was a discovery that being Mexican didn’t cover the whole thing.”
It was only when she arrived at Harvard, and met other students with ties to both Latin America and the United States, that she began identifying herself as Latina. It was then that she realized her peers, though they came from different backgrounds, were experiencing a similar struggle.
“Being Latino is engaging in this constant negotiation of your identity,” Garcia says. “Simply check-marking ‘what is your ethnicity? what is your race?’—it’s always been hard for me.”
The only consistent definition of the Latino experience is one of diversity.
“I think we can be seen as this monolithic group, when in reality we’re all—depending on class, race, nationality, language, there’s a lot going on,” Flores says. “And there’s a conflict between whether I’m Hispanic, Latino, Spanish, El Salvadorian. It’s hard to measure that.”
Maria Luisa Parra-Velasco, a senior preceptor in Romance Languages and Literatures who hails from Mexico, agrees. “What is interesting is that there is not an isolated group. You have a continuum of Latinos,” says Parra. She is the course head for Spanish 59: “Language and the Community,” the College’s only Spanish-language course that focuses primarily on the study of Latinos in the United States.
For many students at Harvard, the Latino community is a family away from home.
“I think that’s one of the reasons why the familia ideology has to be kept strong, because we’re away from our families,” says Artiga, one of Harvard’s delegates at last year’s Latino Ivy League Conference. “It can get lonely, because family is such a strong part of the culture.”
Steven R. Strickland ’13, president of the campus chapter of Phi Iota Alpha, Harvard’s Latino fraternity, emphasizes the concept of family as one of the key foundations of his brotherhood.
“Our initiation process doesn’t have alcohol. We basically teach the kids who want to join about Latino history—it’s pretty much a leadership class,” he says. “I think it gives you the support system and family that you miss from back home.”
But this is a family who says they have never had a home.
BOK AND THE BALKANS
“It is a great step forward to have broadened Harvard’s diversity by enrolling thousands of minority students without compromising academic standards.” —University President Derek C. Bok in his 1980 Commencement speech
The present movement is part of a cycle which dates back to 1980, when student voices and administrative response set the tone of today’s debate.
Bok’s statement reveals an uneasiness surrounding the rapid diversification of the University. The day before Bok’s Commencement speech, members of the Harvard-Radcliffe Third World Center Organization stood before John Harvard sporting a banner that proclaimed: “Harvard’s commitment to diversity is a sham.”
The students had demands. They wanted to establish a Third World Center—a student-run, University-funded space where minority students could gather for support. The press took notice; the administration, soon after. Bok convened a committee to discuss their demands.
Headed by Reverend Peter J. Gomes and comprised of both students and faculty, the committee Bok established had a mandate: Consider the requests for a Third World Center, study how this is handled at other colleges, come up with a plan.
The committee studied precedents set by Harvard’s peer institutions. They studied Yale’s model, wherein Asian American, African American, and Latino students each had their own cultural house—a structure which exists to this day. Next they looked at Brown’s and Princeton’s model, where minority groups shared a common space. Yet to the committee, each of these models seemed too restrictive, inspiring segregation rather than co-existence.
The Committee’s argument is a concept called Balkanization: If we give minority students a center, pretty soon each minority group will want its own. The Latino students will want a center. The African-American students will want a center. The Asian-American students will want one, too.
 Then the Latinos will split into

Each group will want its own room, and pretty soon ethnic groups on campus will be hopelessly fractured, isolated in their own worlds. The university wanted to integrate.
So, in 1981, they created something new: the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, a space that would cater not to one specific ethnic group, but rather use intercultural dialogue to address the needs of all students on campus.
“Every building at Harvard is a multicultural center—every building at Harvard,” says S. Allen Counter, the Foundation’s founding director, reflecting on the events of that year.
Since the Harvard Foundation’s founding, it has sponsored numerous events, panel discussions, and forums for intercultural dialogue. It has invited prominent guests, from Shakira to United States Treasurer Rosa Rios ’87 (a former intern at the Foundation), and sponsored, among other forums, a writers’ series and student dialogues on race.
The Harvard Foundation has fulfilled the goals that the Gomes Committee set out for it. But for some, there is still an unmet need.
ROUND II
“I would rather have Latino Studies 10 than anything else.” —Steven R. Strickland ’13, president of the campus chapter of Phi Iota Alpha
Advocates of Latino Studies emphasize that the establishment of a physical center alone is not enough. While social space and student support is important, it is scholarship that moves our culture forward, says Carrasco.
“You can’t just have a third world center on campus and think that these issues are going to be handled because students of color get together in a place where they can talk,” Carrasco says. While this is good, he continues, “Someone’s got to be doing the very serious scholarship.”
Carrasco would know. About 10 years ago, he and a group of colleagues created a proposal for a Center that would encourage such scholarship at Harvard. By 2001, when their efforts started, strides had already been made for deeper engagement with the study of ethnicity at the University. Much of this impulse came from the Committee on Ethnic Studies, which was founded in 1988 and was originally devoted to the study Asian American, Native American, and Latino populations in the United States. In 1999, the committee began hiring permanent faculty members. Other departments were also beginning to offer courses incorporating more focused study of ethnicity.
The 1994 establishment of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies provided a new impetus for the study of Latin Americans—yet the Center’s focus did not include the study of Latinos in the United States, an absence Carrasco and his colleagues hoped to remedy.
It was for the sake of this serious scholarship that Carrasco and a group of colleagues joined together to create a proposal for Latino Studies at Harvard.
The group of professors, which included Carrasco, Doris Sommer, Gary A. Orfield, Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, and John H. Coatsworth, presented a proposal to the provost.
“We met with the provost, we developed a proposal for this initiative, and the initiative was accepted,” recounts Carrasco. The group was even told—informally—that they would get funding. Yet the promise was short-lived.
“We were told at the end of the summer, four months later, that the funds had been withdrawn,” Carrasco says. The reasons were nebulous. “I was told that the then president of the university, Lawrence Summers, withdrew the funding because of an uneasiness about studies at Harvard that were focused on ethnicity, ethnic studies—but having heard that second hand, I’m not really sure what the reason was.”
Orfield, who was involved with the initial proposal, elaborates. Had it been realized, the institute, he wrote in an email to The Crimson, “would have made Harvard a leader in studies of what soon became the nation's largest minority community,” a minority group whose growing importance, Orfield says, the administration did not understand.
“We worked out an outline plan for creating this enterprise but it was shot down by Pres. Larry Summers who, the Provost told us, thought that if Harvard began such an effort it would divide the country,” wrote Orfield, “and that if there was anything that deserved to be studied someone in the regular faculty departments would study it.”
“It was a deeply discouraging response,” he continued.
In the years since the failed proposal, some of the faculty members originally behind a Latino Studies Center have left the University, sometimes taking valuable scholarly resources with them.
Suarez-Orozco is now at NYU. Coatsworth is at Columbia. While he was at Harvard, Orfield co-founded the Civil Rights Project, a prominent think tank which focuses on Civil Rights for a broad demographic, including Latinos. He moved, with his entire think tank, to UCLA, which, according to Orfield, “is vastly more supportive of this kind of work.”
GOING FORWARD / YENDO ADELANTE
“Why now? It should have been done years ago. There’s no better time than now.” —Michael J. Trejo, co-founder of HLSA
The struggle for a Latino Studies Center is more than philosophical: It’s logistical, and it’s far from accomplished.
“Every tub has its own bottom; every school has its own endowment,” Trejo says. “The existing infrastructure is so ad-hoc. You have to believe if it were coordinated and well thought-through, [a center] could be amazing.”
Trejo says it will take much more than administrative consensus and funding to make the center a reality.
Dean of Arts and Humanities Diana Sorensen stresses that student participation is key.
The administration is “extraordinarily receptive,” to student efforts, she says. Sorensen has strongly supported the Committees on Human Rights and Ethnic Studies. Latina herself, she envisions Ethnic Studies as a supportive place for the study of Latinos. Sorensen details a recent collaboration between the Committee on Ethnic Studies, Fuerza Latina, and Mather House to host an event about Spanglish as an example of what such a collaboration could look like.
“When Michael Trejo came to speak to us about a Latino Studies Center that would be University-wide,” she says, “Professor Shelemay [the chair of the Committee on Ethnic Studies] and I said, ‘You’re welcome, let’s do things together.’”
Carrasco concurs: “Students have much more power than they think.”
Sections
"Man on the flying trapeze and his brother,” “rock the baby,” and “walk the dog” are all yo-yo tricks for those talented enough to compete in the World Yo-Yo Contest. For me, however, the most basic yo-yo move—up and down—is tough enough. In my youth, I had three yo-yos: one green, one opaque, and one purple. At one point or another all of them ended up with tight knots that prevented any motion. Attempts were made to revive them, but inevitably the yo-yos found their way to the back of a desk drawer that got emptied out into the trash to make room for old Gameboys. Eventually, the drawer was emptied a final time because we were moving for good.
Two weeks before moving, I learned that the “inventor” of the yo-yo, Louis Marx, had lived a few blocks away from my then home. Although he didn’t come up with the idea for the toy, Marx found a way to make the product cheaper and more efficiently than anyone else. Accordingly, he’s been credited with the mass production and popularity of the yo-yo (playsets and dollhouses, too).
Listen: The story goes, as I heard it from my friend, that Marx made it through the Great Depression with his own toy company. He was friends with Dwight D. Eisenhower and many other generals who no one mentions because everyone remembers them less. Supposedly, Marx was called the “toy king.” He read the dictionary for fun and had the words “live it up” stitched into the ties he gave as presents. On Halloween, he’d have kids from the neighborhood over to his mansion where he gave out his toys (laid out on in the dining room) and money ($1 each).
Here I would like to assert that I was one of the first people in my town to know—and by this I mean think—about the unoccupied mansion in years. I’m willing to fight whoever challenges that, depending on size. It was a spontaneous late-night drive one night during those two weeks before we moved; a friend showed me his favorite spots in some neighboring towns—a train station overlooking the Long Island Sound, a park with an old ampitheater, a gazebo with a view of the George Washington Bridge. We didn’t stop at any place for too long. Just a pause, Velvet Underground still playing, and then we’d move to the next.
Driving the route back to my house, he turned down a road with 29 identical houses that I hadn’t known existed. He didn’t need to point out the eighth one down on the right. Unlike the others—stout, asymmetric—this one, situated further back from the road, did not require proximity to confirm that it had stood there for years. Even in the dark, four white tall columns, deep red brick, and a stone frieze compelled my friend to lower the volume on music he had recently rediscovered from the sixties.
Marx, he told me, had owned the whole street. Where the 29 houses now stood, there had only been lawns before—nine children and 13 dogs, a four-car garage and a paddle court. Without someone to attend to them, the grounds had become overgrown; I had the feeling that before we arrived that night, no one had paid attention in 25 years. From where we stood outside the mansion flanked by oaks, I could see that one of the floors was sunken in. Many of the windows were broken and boarded up messily with planks of wood. We walked on the other side, out back, and saw that one of the columns, meant for holding up the unoccupied home, lay in the grass.
I thought of my own home. Rooms had fallen into disuse for the first time in 13 years after my dad moved out and my brother and sister had left for college. Dust had accumulated, showers had broken, a tree had fallen on the roof after a storm. Baseball in the backyard and movies in the basement were cloudy memories that now resembled my damaged home less than the century-old mansion that bent before me.
Months later, I saw the first pictures on Facebook of girls posing by the mansion’s exterior (pouting by some of the columns) and interior (draped on an elaborate staircase). A classmate bragged about having a party there. All the while, the floor was sinking even lower. The legend of the mansion became about beers that had possibly been drunk and hook-ups that had probably never accumulated.
When the string that kept the Marx house in use began to fray is unclear. Throughout time, the story of Louis Marx and his home has gone up and down, dipping in and out of awareness. Wound in the early 1900s at the house’s construction, the story was finally released, decades later, when Marx rose to fame. When he died, the story and the home zipped into hiding until my generation. Maybe that motion caused friction that began the break.
Years before, the home had been declared a landmark. Now, the mansion is past salvaging attempts. In February the current owners were reportedly given permission to tear it down.
My old home, in contrast, found a new owner. Instead of throwing the house out or leaving it at the back of the drawer, a family with four young children (two are twins) fixed it up and used every room, taking out the knots, and replacing the string.
After all, that’s the thing about houses, stories, and other seemingly transient things: Even when they seem to be lost, too far gone to save, they never really are. Things that matter aren’t forgotten that easily.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Sept. 26, 2012, at 8:10 p.m.
Harvard’s endowment dipped in value for the first time since the 2009 fiscal year, its investments dropping 0.05 percent and the overall level of endowment funds dropping to $30.7 billion in the 2012 fiscal year, University administrators announced Thursday.
In its annual report, the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University's endowment, noted the volatility in the global financial markets in the last fiscal year, which began on July 1, 2011 and ended June 30, 2012.  U.S. stocks ended that period slightly up in a year that included the Standard & Poor's downgrading of U.S. debt in Aug. 2011.
“The markets during the last year continued to be choppy and highly sensitive to unresolved macroeconomic headwinds,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in a press release. “While investment performance over the last twelve months was well below long-term averages, we nevertheless found good investment opportunities through both internal and external management that we believe will sow the seeds for future growth.”
The annual endowment return was less than the 1.7 percent growth of the S&P 500 Index, which weights the growth of the 500 largest publicly-traded companies in the U.S and serves as a benchmark that tracks the overall performance of major US stocks.  Public equities, however, are often seen as more volatile than university endowments, which tend to carry less risk than stocks and therefore might yield lower returns.
According to the report, Harvard’s endowment nonetheless beat HMC’s benchmark Policy Portfolio, a set of assets determined by the HMC board to best serve Harvard’s long-run financial needs, by about a percentage point.
Last year, Harvard’s endowment grew by 21.4 percent to $32 billion. Over the past 20 years, the Harvard’s average annual endowment return has averaged 12.3 percent.
Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, Harvard’s endowment reached an all-time high of $36.9 billion. After the crash the endowment fell 27.3 percent, losing $11 billion--a loss which has yet to be fully recovered.
Many of Harvard’s peer institutions have yet to post endowment returns for for the fiscal year 2012. Princeton has yet to release endowment figures, but Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman told Bloomberg News recently that she expected the school’s endowment to post a return between zero and five percent. The University of Pennsylvania recently announced a 1.6 percent return, bringing its endowment to approximately $6.8 billion.
Harvard’s flat returns can primarily be attributed to HMC’s unusually large stake in foreign equities, which fared far worse than many other asset classes this fiscal year.
Harvard’s endowment is broken into five asset classes—public equities, private equity, fixed income, absolute return, and real assets. Of those broad asset classes, only public equities, which include foreign equities, posted negative returns for the 2012 fiscal year.
Among Harvard’s foreign equities, the value of investments in developed countries dropped 10.81 percent and the value of investments in developing countries dropped 17.43 percent. Overall, the value of Harvard’s public equities dropped 6.66 percent.
“Despite difficult markets, we are pleased that investment performance remained steady and the endowment was able to provide substantial support to the University,” University Treasurer James F. Rothenberg ’68 said in the press release. “In such volatile economic times, it’s important to note that results in any 12 month period can vary dramatically. Jane and her team have done an excellent job strengthening Harvard’s portfolio and I’m confident the endowment is well positioned for the long-term.”

CORRECTION: Sept. 27
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard’s endowment dropped 0.05 percent in the 2012 fiscal year. In fact, its investments dropped 0.05 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
College administrators expect to cap the number of registered programs offered this year for students returning to campus before the start of spring classes during Wintersession, halting the growth in the number of activities the program has offered over the past three years.
At a reception on Tuesday for faculty members and freshman and sophomore advisers, College administrators voiced their intention to prioritize improving existing programming and maintaining the flexibility of the program, instead of focusing on increasing the number of activities.
“We’re not looking to significantly expand the number of programs...but to strengthen the ones we have and to really respond to what student interests are.” said Lisa M. Boes, who leads the Winter Break and Wintersession Planning Committee.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds voiced enthusiasm for the development of Wintersession, saying she thinks the program “is really taking off.”
In last year’s ten-day Wintersession, 140 programs were registered. That marked an increase from about 100 registered programs in 2011, when the then-eight day program was called Optional Winter Activities Week. OWAW represented the first time all students were allowed to return to campus for January activities.
In 2010, the first year after the overhaul of the academic calendar created a gap between semesters, a limited number of students were permitted to return to campus to pursue independent activities during January. That first year, no formal programming was offered.
This January, Wintersession will last for ten days between Jan. 18 and 27, featuring new and returning program offerings and a streamlined funding process for student-initiated programming. Boes said she expects approximately 140 programs to be registered this year.
Undergraduate Council President Danny P. Bicknell '13 said in an interview that he wants to see more days and more activities added to Wintersession. Still, Bicknell said he supports the College’s effort to improve existing programming.
“There was a lot of existing programming last semester that could be definitely improved,” Bicknell said. “I definitely see the point of making sure we have a very solid programming base moving forward.”
Hammonds emphasized the administration’s desire to avoid rigidity in Wintersession programming to allow students to pursue their own interests.
“The way we envision it, going forward, right now, is the programs will change some each year based on student interest and what faculty, staff, and some other students come up with,” Hammonds said.
Boes, who is also resident dean of Pforzheimer House, said the administration decided to cap the increase in program offerings because of a lack of sufficient demand.
“If we had 200 programs, I don’t think we’d have the students to populate them all,” Boes said.
Boes said it is difficult to estimate the number of students who return to campus for Wintersession because not all students formally register for programs.
Boes also said this year’s later start date of spring classes, Jan. 28, could encourage students to pursue extended off-campus activities during Wintersession.
Boes added that the planning committee is focused on ensuring continued progress for Wintersession.
“We’re just really trying to build on the success of last year,” she said. “We had a really successful week. Students were really happy.”

In a push to increase transparency in Harvard’s administration, the Undergraduate Council will publish reports from student-faculty committee meetings on their website this academic year, according to UC Vice President Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13.
“Transparency is a huge part of why we do this,” UC Education Committee Chair Terah E. Lyons ’14 said. “We want there to be transparency in the administration but also in the UC.”
Student representatives plan to regularly post updates of every committees’ progress to the council website, though it is still to be decided whether the few committees dealing with confidential information will similarly publicize their workings.
In conjunction with the launch of Navigate Harvard, a new UC initiative that maps out the hierarchy of the University’s administration, the website will allow students insight into the inner workings of Harvard’s higher levels, according to Yalamanchi.
“The Harvard administration can seem like a huge black box and no one knows what goes on inside,” she said. “This will help us to see who is responsible for what and who we can go to with concerns.”
The council will also factor undergraduate input into areas of student life that are of growing interest to the administration by implementing three new student-faculty committees on Wintersession, relations with University Health Services, and library support. The UC will accept applications for nearly 60 open positions on 17 committees until the Sept. 29 deadline, at which point the interview process will begin.
Applicants will progress to the interview round after review by Lyons and Student Life Committee Chair Michael C. George ’14, who is also a Crimson news writer.
“We look for students who are dedicated to a cause and passionate about whatever committee they are a part of,” Lyons said.
For many students, involvement in student-faculty committees serves as a convenient introduction to the UC as an organization. For example, newly elected Currier House representative Sietse K. Goffard ’15 said his work with the Harvard University Dining Services committee to implement both healthy and festive options in dining halls across campus inspired him to run for the UC this fall.
“HUDS motivated and inspired me to become a more active advocate for the student body—not just about food, which is a very important issue, but also about student life,” Goffard said.
After being involved with his high school student government, Donny R. Yung ’16 said he hopes to increase swipe access, expand social space, and work closely with administrators by applying to the Committee on Student Life.
“In my high school I did a lot of working with faculty and administrators to enhance student life and experience, and I want to try to help to do that here as well,” Yung said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tampons, toothpaste, and condoms have taken the place of potato chips, candy bars, and water bottles in a vending machine in the basement of New Quincy that was installed this Monday.
The Quincy dorm-essentials vending machine is the first launched by Momba, a new entrepreneurial venture launched by Steven R. Duque ’09. The company’s name, according to Duque, the company’s founder and CEO, describes it’s product’s role as a “second mother” in caring 24/7 for students’ needs.
The machine installed in New Quincy will be the first of two placed at Harvard before Duque expands to other universities in the Boston area. A second machine will replace a Coca-Cola machine that was moved out of Weld Hall on Wednesday.
Duque, a former Quincy resident who built the machine with his wife and CFO Heather, said that Momba aims to be a safer and more convenient alternative to CVS, a seven-minute walk from New Quincy.
“I know [safety is] not top of mind for all students, but from administrators’ and parents’ standpoints, this is great,” he said.
Students said that the vending machine’s installation will be an asset in terms of both convenience and safety.
“Any measure to increase student safety and to reduce students walking through late night streets is a good measure,” Akshay M. Sharma ’14, an Undergraduate Council representative from Cabot House, said.
Sharma also added that the machine will be especially useful “with winter coming.”
According to Duque, the benefits of Momba extend beyond convenience and safety. Duque, who said that he is committed to philanthropy in business, has pledged to contribute ten percent of profits to the host schools’ financial aid programs.
Students said that this would provide additional incentive for using the Momba machines installed on campus.
“I would definitely go there instead of CVS if ten percent of proceeds are going to financial aid,” Quincy resident Constantin C. Bosinceanu ’14 said. “I hate the walk to CVS.”
Having relied on financial aid while at Harvard, Duque said he is dedicated to making a positive impact on the communities at host schools by contributing towards financial aid endowments and providing students with entrepreneurial exposure.
The company has worked with local college students to offer practical business experience to those studying at host schools. Duque emphasized his commitment to philanthropy and said that he has “turned away applicants not interested in social good.”
With help from students at future host schools, Duque is preparing for Momba’s debut beyond Harvard. Students at Boston College, Boston University, and UMass-Amherst are already promoting the machine in return for performance-based compensation.
Harvard students will have the opportunity to learn more about Momba, including potential employment opportunities, when Duque speaks at the Innovation Lab during this weekend’s “Startup Scramble.”

With the sounds of sawing metal and large trucks filling the air around Old Quincy’s Plympton Street construction site each day, students who live in surrounding buildings say that the noise from the renovations has escalated in the past few weeks as the renewal of the building proceeds.
Construction on this first “test project” for Harvard’s ambitious House Renewal program began this summer, but with students back in classes and dorms, many say that loud noises and early-morning wake-up calls have become an increasing reality.
Taylor C. Zangara ’13, who lives in a room facing the construction on the sixth floor of New Quincy, said she has been bothered by the noise, both in the morning and during the day.
With work beginning at 8 a.m., Zangara said it has woken her up several times before her alarm goes off.
“It’s annoying especially when it’s warm out and I have my window open,” she added.
During the day when Zangara is studying in the Qube—Quincy’s House library—she said the noise creeps up into the library as well.
“It’s going to bother me for the rest of the year,” Zangara said.
The noise issue, however, has affected residents of surrounding Houses, students say.
Andrew M. Garbarino ’13, who lives in a room in Old Leverett’s B-entryway with windows facing the construction, said he often hears little rumbles that remind him of hydraulic pipes.
Though Garbarino said the noise has never woken him up, he explained that it has bothered him when he is lying in bed after his alarm goes off.
Beyond the noise, most students have said that they have faced other inconveniences related to the construction.
Christopher M. Wankel ’13, a self-proclaimed deep sleeper, said the noise from his bedroom on the third floor of New Quincy is nothing unreasonable. Yet, he said it has become difficult to enter Quincy courtyard at night because the back gate that leads to Leverett House is locked at night.
Likewise, Garbarino pointed out that only one side of the pedestrian path on Plympton Street is open.
For Quincy residents, the lack of access to the Quincy courtyard has also been inconvenient.
Regina C. J. Hodge ’13 said she misses hanging out with her friends in the courtyard when the weather is nice.
“I sit in the courtyard less than I used to,” she said. “It looks ugly, but I guess it can’t be helped.”
Zangara, who said she used to play soccer or lounge around in front of Old Quincy, said that this is no longer an option.
“It’s not pleasant to sit outside,” she added.
Despite the inconveniences, Zangara said she would still rather live in New Quincy, nearer to the noise, than the three apartment buildings used as swing spaces to house the 180 residents displaced by the construction.
“I like being in the House,” she said, “because it’s close to the dining hall and everything else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two letters addressing recent controversies touching both Massachusetts candidates for U.S. Senate pulled the campaign trail rhetoric deeper into issues of character Wednesday, adding new pressure for transparency from both candidates.
In one letter, U.S. Senator Scott Brown demanded Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren release a comprehensive list of corporate legal clients she counseled while at Harvard. Brown’s campaign then came under fire in a letter from Bill John Baker, the principal chief of the Cherokee Nation, denouncing two Brown staffers who were videotaped doing tomahawk chops and calling out war chants at a political rally earlier this week.
The letters point to what has increasingly become the contest’s dominant theme: character. Brown has raised various questions about Warren’s transparency in the past, specifically whether or not she benefited from her claims of Native American ancestry while at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.
The issue resurfaced quickly at last week’s senatorial debate, followed by new allegations by Brown that Warren fought against victims of asbestos exposure while representing Travelers Insurance. On Monday, Brown pointed to another case in which Warren helped LTV Steel avoid paying into a retirement fund for miners.
“In each case, your work for these corporations is at odds with the image you portray on the campaign trail fighting for the middle class and the little guy,” Brown wrote in his letter Wednesday.
Harvard Law School professors must report annually any outside work they take on. The Law School does not release this information.
Warren responded to Brown’s letter at a rally Wednesday morning, where she received the endorsement of the Professional Fire Fighters of Massachusetts.
“Since I went into public service in 2008 I have released all of my financial disclosure. I have released all of my client contacts. And I must say I’m a little surprised to hear this from Senator Brown. As I understand it, he has been in public service now for 25 years and has never released the name of a single client,” Warren said.
Released less than an hour later, Baker’s letter came in response to a video put online earlier this week that showed two Brown staffers performing a “tomahawk chop” and shouting mock war cries at a political rally. Baker said the incident “goes far beyond what is appropriate and proper in political discourse.”
“The use of stereotypical ‘war whoop chants’ and ‘tomahawk chops’ are offensive and downright racist,” Baker wrote. “A campaign that would allow and condone such offensive and racist behavior must be called to task for their actions.”
Brown said his campaign did not condone such action, but has yet to take any specific action on the incident.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a screening of the documentary “The Prep School Negro” on Wednesday night, students, faculty members, and the film’s director Andre Robert Lee discussed the questions of what is gained and what is sacrificed by life inside the elite ivory tower.
Lee, who grew up in poverty in Philadelphia, based the film on his own disorienting high school experiences after receiving a full scholarship to Germantown Friends School, one of the most prestigious preparatory schools in the country.
“Though my tuition was covered, I still paid a great cost,” Lee said.
Aubrey J. Walker ’15—an intern at the Harvard Foundation, one of the sponsors of the event—organized the screening after he saw the film more than a year ago.
Walker and Lee met through the Gates Millennium Scholars program, and, when Walker first came to Harvard, he approached the Foundation about screening it.
“It really allowed me to reflect critically upon my own experience and let me know that there are other individuals going through the same thing as myself,” Walker said.
The film focused on the divide between Lee’s life at home and his life in a predominantly white school. Because he saw his culture as often clashing with his education, Lee said he felt like an outsider in both his home life and his school life.
At the screening, he joked about how he would pronounce the word “ask” differently from his classmates and how a classmate once said, “Well, if you axe me, I will bleed.”
After watching the movie, the audience participated in a discussion about the implications of the film and what message they would walk away with. Lee’s remarks stressed the fact that students are not alone.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said that the film has broader implications for the diverse members of the Harvard community.
“It relates very much to our fall exercise Community Conversations where we assign the introduction to ‘Whistling Vivaldi,’” he said. “We’re all the time encouraging people to consider who they are, what assumptions they carry, the privileges or special challenges they bring into the community, and how we can develop a community that’s genuinely understanding and mutually respectful.”
Lee said that, while the title of the documentary—“The Prep School Negro”—may not seem politically correct, he chose it to be provocative and express an identity he had felt for a long time.
For Lee, the best part about screening the movie is listening to students share their own stories.
“I had five people come up to me and say ‘Thank you for telling this story. This is my story. You’ve ended my loneliness,’” Lee said. “I was like ‘Yeah home run.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than twenty students began their quest for academic dominance, local television fame, and part of a $15,000 grand prize during auditions Monday and Tuesday for Harvard’s delegation to the New England Sports Network’s game show “AT&T Schooled: NESN’s College Face Off.”
Though the show is in its second season, this is the first year that Harvard will be represented in the seven-episode series.
The show will pit teams of three students from eight local colleges in a competition focusing on academic knowledge and intelligence, possibly including logic puzzles, memory games, and trivia, according to Scott Masterson, the show director.
The challenge will involve head-to-head face offs between teams, with chances for cash and prizes throughout the rounds, and the winning schools advancing in a tournament bracket.
Teams from Boston College, Williams College, Amherst College, Norwich University, University of New Hampshire, and University of Vermont will also compete, all vying to dethrone returning champions Providence College.
Masterson said that Harvard is expected to do well this year, but Boston College and Providence College both have strong teams.
Akanksha Sharma ’14, a Cabot resident, auditioned for the show this week after seeing the booth in the Square.
“I was just walking by and one of the guys caught my attention,” said Sharma. “I ended up talking to him for a minute and auditioning. I thought that it was a fun thing to do.”
The audition process included a written questionnaire, a test, and an on-camera interview.
John M. A. McCallum ’16 said that his favorite part of the process was the question about his biggest regret in life. McCallum’s answer: “applying to Yale.”
Kim-Mai T. Le ’16 said that she had never heard of the show before, but might consider watching it this season.
“It depends of the questions. I’ll watch the first episode and see if I like it,” said Le. “I think it might be like ‘Jeopardy!’”
Filming for the show will begin on Oct. 8 at Harvard, when Harvard’s team will take on Boston College. Filming will take place at the Harvard Stadium, the Bright Hockey Center, and along the banks of the Charles River.
Michael Showalter, a Brown alumnus and comedian known for his work on MTV’s “The State” and the film “Wet Hot American Summer,” will host the show for its second season.
The show will air starting in the last week of October, with the final set to be shown at the end of November.

Leaders with higher levels of responsibility experience lower stress levels than their peers with less on their shoulders, according to the results of a recent study published by researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Business School, Stanford University, and the University of California at San Diego.
The research team, led by Harvard Kennedy School professor Jennifer S. Lerner, conducted two studies to measure the levels of stress indicators in different populations.
The team—which also included Gary D. Sherman, a postdoctoral fellow at the Business School, and Business School associate professor Amy J. C. Cuddy—compared these metrics between leaders and non-leaders and then designed a second experiment to measure stress levels among leaders of varying responsibility.
The first study worked with a diverse range of volunteer participants from the Boston community active in a variety of different industries. The researchers found that the levels of the stress hormone cortisol, as measured with saliva samples, were lower for the leaders—defined as those who manage other people—and higher for the non-leaders. Self-reported anxiety followed a similar pattern.
“It is important to stress that when we talk about stress, it’s not when students walk around saying ‘I’m so stressed out’—that’s a subjective feeling,” said Lerner. “These are biologically measured differences in stress hormone levels.”
The second study was performed with only pre-defined leaders—the majority of whom were government officials and military officers—in order to determine if there are differences in stress among groups of leaders. Those with higher levels of leadership, as measured by the number of subordinates, were found to have lower cortisol levels.
The research team also began to explore why there was this discrepancy between different leaders.
“We found it is because of perceptions of control,” Lerner said.
The results indicate that leadership responsibilities provide one with a greater sense of control. However, since the study measured only a correlation between leadership and stress, Lerner said that the opposite may be true as well.
“Of course, it’s quite possible that the reverse causal direction occurs as well—people may rise to positions of leadership because they have a skill for insulating themselves from the stresses that go with increased responsibility,” Lerner said in the press release.
Lerner, who is currently teaching a class on “emotional influences on decision making,” said she plans to weave in the ideas behind this study into her teaching in the future. She also sees ways to incorporate the findings of this study into everyday life.
“The more a student can take control of his schedule, the better,” she said.
The results of the study were released online on Tuesday and will be published this week in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Trinity College head baseball coach Bill Decker has been named the new Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 Head Coach for Harvard Baseball, Athletics Director Bob Scalise announced Tuesday night.
In Decker, the Crimson has found its replacement for Joe Walsh, who suddenly passed away from an apparent heart attack on July 31 after serving as manager of the Crimson for 17 years. Walsh’s assistant Thomas Lo Ricco had served as interim head coach while the Harvard athletic department conducted a nationwide search for a permanent replacement.
“Obviously it’s a situation that nobody in baseball wanted to be in with the untimely passing of Joe Walsh,” Decker said in a statement Tuesday. “Nevertheless this is a tremendous opportunity at a world-class institution, and I greatly look forward to both those opportunities as well as the challenges to come.”
Decker served as head coach of the Bantams for 22 years, accumulating a career record of 529-231. The all-time winningest coach in Trinity sports history, he was named the ABCA National Coach of the Year in 2008 after leading the Bantams to an undefeated regular season and the Division III National Championship, finishing with a 45-1 record overall.
“I am thrilled for Bill and his family and am extremely supportive of his decision to pursue this great opportunity at Harvard,” Trinity Athletic Director Michael Renwick said in a statement.  “Bill has been such a catalyst over the years in Trinity's great athletic tradition.... His leadership of our baseball program will be missed.”
Trinity’s 44-game winning streak in 2008 is the longest in Division III baseball history, and its .978 winning percentage that season set an NCAA record for any sport. During his tenure, Decker managed the Bantams to five total conference titles and nine NCAA tournaments—including four College World Series appearances—and was named the New England Coach of the Year four times. Last season, Trinity finished 34-11 while winning the NESCAC Championship.
“I have been fortunate to spend 22 years at a wonderful place in Trinity College that's been home to me and my family,” Decker said in a statement. “I step away from that program knowing it's healthy and knowing that I can share a similar situation with the wonderful people at Harvard.”
The coach will be looking to turn around a program that recently struggled greatly under Walsh, going 61-150 over the past five seasons. Members of the team said that while they were still mourning Walsh’s passing, the presence of a new manager would allow them to turn their attention towards the future.
“The team’s ready to move forward and get ready to play some baseball,” outfielder Jack Colton ’14 said. “[Coach Decker] really built a successful program down at Trinity, and we’re excited to see what he’s all about.”
Pitcher Baron S. Davis ’14 said the squad would be introduced to Decker on Wednesday.
“I’m pretty excited to meet him,” Davis said. “He has a great record coming from Trinity; he’s won over 500 games, so we’re pretty psyched. He seems like a pretty straight-edged guy.”
Decker is a graduate of Ithaca College, where he was a football and baseball star. He took over the Trinity baseball program before the 1991 season after a year as manager at Macalester College in Minnesota, and he also served as an assistant football coach during his first years with the Bantams.
A member of the 1997 USA Baseball National Trials coaching staff, Decker has had eight former players go on to play baseball professionally over the past seven seasons. He will begin his duties with Harvard immediately.
“We are extremely excited to have someone of Bill's character and background to lead our baseball program,” Scalise said in a statement. “We are particularly impressed with Bill's successes at a well-respected academic institution such as Trinity. Harvard has a lengthy tradition of excellence in baseball, and we trust that our program will thrive under Coach Decker.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some nights, the ball just seems to refuse to find the back of the net. It was that kind of night for the Harvard women’s soccer team (3-3-2, 0-1 Ivy), which posted a season-high 31 shots, including 13 on goal. Ultimately, though, the Crimson came up empty handed in a 0-0 double overtime draw against Central Connecticut State University (1-8-1, 0-2 NEC) on Tuesday night at Soldier’s Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
Even though  Harvard didn’t pick up a win, the team seemed happy with its performance according to junior co-captain Peyton Johnson.
“We can walk away knowing that we can create a lot of chances,” said Johnson, who leads the team with four assists this season. “It was definitely an improvement after [last Friday’s loss at] Penn. We learned things we’re good at, things we’re not good at, and we worked for 110 minutes and competed until the end.”
In first halves this season, the Crimson has had trouble jumpstarting its offense, scoring just three goals total in the first half of its games, and, accordingly, was looking to set the tone early.
“We were definitely trying to be more opportunistic—coming off of the Penn loss, I don’t think we practiced anything differently,” Johnson explained. “It was just a mentality switch. In the Penn game, there were opportunities that we didn’t take, and today I don’t think you could say that happened.”
Sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten agreed, stating her team’s intention to attack the goal.
“We didn’t have too many shots on goal against Penn,” Kanten said. “So a lot of the focus on offense was to get in and shoot and force the keeper to make a save.”
Harvard came out of the gates strong, putting up two shots in the first two minutes and posting 10 in the first half overall, including three by sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby.
In the 30th minute, her shot from the right side smacked off the crossbar and bounced down into the box, where a brief frenzy ensued before Blue Devil goalkeeper Nikola Deiter secured the ball.
The Crimson would have several more near-goal chances throughout the match, many set up by Casscells-Hamby, who had eight of Harvard’s 31 shots.
“Meg is a dynamic player,” Johnson said. “She always finds a way to make things happen. She works on both sides of the ball and makes the best of a lot of crummy situations.”
It was Casscells-Hamby who set up what was perhaps the Crimson’s best chance to score on the evening. At the 92:40 mark, she streaked down the right side and crossed the ball to junior forward Elizabeth Weisman, whose shot went off the crossbar. Senior defender Taryn Kurcz slid to knock the ball in, but Deiter was able to make the save.
Harvard’s defense remained consistent all game, allowing just five shots in the last 65 minutes of the game, and just four shots on goal for the match.
“The great defense from the back allowed us to be in attacking mode the whole time,” Johnson said. “We had a mentality of team defense today that meant the other team wasn’t able to get out of their half [of the field].”
Kanten credited her defensive players with providing the help necessary to hold Central Connecticut scoreless.
“The defense is new to working together, but they have such a great attitude, and their work ethic is through the roof,” Kanten said. “It’s great working back there with them.” While the defense effectively stymied the Blue Devils for much of the game, Central Connecticut had one serious chance in overtime. In the 92nd minute, Blue Devil forward Jewel Robinson broke away and took on Kanten one-on-one. But Kanten did not allow Robinson to capitalize, running and sliding to make the save.
It would be the last time the Central Connecticut offense would be a threat. The Crimson, though, would make a bit more noise. In the 96th minute, Kurcz’s header off of senior midfielder Aisha Price’s throw-in clanked off the crossbar.
Then, three minutes into the second overtime, Johnson crossed the ball to the left side of the box. Weisman’s shot tipped off of the leaping Deiter’s hand and over the goal. She finished the night upping her season save percentage to 80 percent, adding 13 saves for a total of 64 for the season.
“[Deiter] was awesome,” Kanten said. “We definitely could’ve put a little more pressure on her, but she really just had a great game.”
But Harvard is not letting a mere draw to deter it from moving forward, Johnson said.
“Playing a midweek game after a tough loss [against Penn] was definitely beneficial,” she explained. “We got out there and saw what it felt like to dominate a game, what it felt like to get shots off.”
Weisman believes that patience will be the key moving on to the rest of the Ivy season.
“We’re just excited to be able to take some shots,” Weisman said. “Obviously, we want to score some of them, but the goals will come, and it’s just taking a little time. We’re willing to wait a little for them and get them when they really count.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an average day in Harvard Yard, you may find tourists taking pictures by the John Harvard statue, students rushing from class to class, or a squirrel scampering up a tree, but you may also encounter a different spectacle of seven guys tanning in the grass listening to Korean pop music.
Those seven guys may stand out in the Yard, but they have also managed to stand out as crucial members of the Harvard water polo team.
“We started a club,” said freshman attacker and San Diego-native Blake Lee. “It’s called SOGO, which stands for ‘Sun’s out, guns out,’ and all five of the California freshmen created it so we can keep our tans. We even have tank tops.”
The freshman water polo players love their sport, a good tan, and a bit of “Gangnam Style,” but once they enter the pool they are all business.
Lee and fellow first-years Robbie Fluegge, Noah Harrison, Chris Miao, Austen Novis, Colin Woolway, and Ben Zepfel have combined for 93 goals, 89 steals and 52 assists between them this season and have helped catapult the Crimson (9-5, 4-0 CWPA) to a six game winning streak, its longest in ten years.
“They’re bringing a whole new focus to the program that I didn’t necessarily see in the past few years,” junior attacker and co-captain Will Roller said. “They’re all very intense.”
Leading Harvard to a six-game winning streak and a successful four-win weekend, the freshmen have proven their prowess offensively and defensively in the pool. Harrison with 22 goals, Zepfel with 30 goals, and Lee with 30 goals have spearheaded the offense, while Lee has also chipped in 27 steals and 23 assists. All three have also been recipients of the CWPA Rookie of the Week award this month.
On the defensive end, Woolway has made his mark between the pipes, notching 51 saves so far while splitting time with junior Jimmy Field.
“They’re all doing a great job,” Crimson coach Ted Minnis said. “I’m very happy how hard they are working and how quickly they’ve adapted to the system and adapted to Division I water polo. They’re a pretty special class.”
The water polo team is relatively young with seven freshmen, five sophomores, and just three juniors and two seniors, and transitioning into a new school and onto a new team can be an intimidating process.
But the freshmen give credit to their support system of upperclassmen, family members, and each other for easing the transition.
“There are not a lot of upperclassmen, but they’re all really nice and inclusive,” Woolway said. “It was easy to fit in.”
For many of the Harvard rookies, the older team members played a huge factor in the college decision-making process. For some, it was even a family matter.
“My brother [Evan Zepfel ’12] just graduated from Harvard in the spring, and he was on the water polo team, so I came to visit a bunch and really liked it,” said Zepfel, who has also contributed 16 steals and 5 assists this season.
In the process of getting used to college life, the freshmen have also bonded as a class. Fluegge revealed he actually keeps a list of movies on his iPhone for freshman movie nights.
“We all love ‘Anchorman,’” Fluegge said. “We can all quote the entire movie.”
Fluegge’s list is full of titles like ‘Anchorman,’ ‘Superbad,’ ‘Ted,’ and even ‘Mean Girls,’ ensuring that the squad’s upcoming road trips to the Bison Invitaional in Lewisburg, Pa., and the Claremont Convergence in Claremont, Calif., will include plenty of movie nights as well as tough competition.
“We’re pumped about traveling to California in a couple weeks because we’ll have the opportunity to play some good teams,” Harrison said. “I’m also excited about walking around in a speedo, getting bronzed, and eating burritos.”
But much effort as Harrison, Fluegge, Lee, Miao, Novis, Woolway, and Zepfel put into their tans, they also put into their play. The rookies take their roles in the pool seriously and have pushed each other and their veteran teammates in practice.
“Everyone has improved because of the freshman class,” Field said.
“They’re a great group of guys, they’re a fun group to coach,  and they bring enthusiasm to practice,’ Minnis added. “They make it fun to come to work every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After snapping a six-match losing streak on Tuesday night, the Harvard women’s volleyball team hopes to build momentum as it enters the heart of Ivy League play this weekend, welcoming Princeton and Penn to the Malkin Athletic Center.
“We took a lot of lumps, but we got better,” Crimson coach Jennifer Weiss said of the team’s performance during a challenging non-conference preseason, which the Crimson (3-9, 0-1 Ivy) concluded Tuesday evening with a home victory over Holy Cross (0-16).
The 3-1 win marked the first time this season the Crimson went on to win a match after dropping a set. Senior setter Beth Kinsella hopes that Harvard will display a similar resilience this weekend.
“In some of our other losses, I think we’ve gotten a little rattled once we’ve started to lose control, and [Tuesday] we were able to just maintain our confidence throughout the whole game,” Kinsella said.  “I think that knowing that we can push back when a team is pushing at us is something you really can’t learn in practice.”
Now Harvard’s focus shifts entirely to the Ivy League as the team prepares to host Princeton (4-7, 1-0 Ivy) on Friday and Penn (5-7, 0-1 Ivy) on Saturday. The Crimson dropped its Ivy League opener at Dartmouth (2-9, 1-0 Ivy) in a close five-set match last Friday.
“Penn’s a strong blocking team, and Princeton is a very scrappy, defensive team, so we have to prepare, scout, and do our homework,” Weiss said.
Last Saturday, Princeton visited Penn for the two teams’ Ivy League opener. The Tigers rallied from a 2-1 deficit to win in five sets.
Both squads have traditionally been near the top of Ivy League volleyball as the two programs have combined for 24 Ivy League titles in 35 years. In 2011, Princeton finished one game behind Yale to place second in the Ancient Eight with an 11-3 record against conference opponents, and Penn finished one game ahead of Harvard to place fifth. The Crimson went 0-2 versus the 2011 Tigers but swept its season series against the Quakers.
But according to Kinsella, past results are poor predictors of this year’s contests.
“The Ivy League is always really variable. One team might be good the next year or not as strong,” Kinsella said. “Each Ivy League game any team can win, so when it comes down to it, it’s about maintaining composure and confidence.”
For a successful weekend, Harvard will look for a pair of strong performances from Kinsella and captain Taylor Docter. Kinsella has recorded a Harvard-high 5.42 assists per set this season, and Docter leads the Crimson with 3.00 kills per set and six double-doubles, but the disciplined Tiger and Quaker defenses will provide an interesting challenge for the two veterans.
The senior duo will have the support of young talent as freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace, freshman setter Hannah Schmidt, sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey, and sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters will also take the floor this weekend. Schmidt has recorded two double-doubles this month for the Crimson, while Wallace, Casey and Walters have earned All-Tournament team selections during Harvard’s preseason play.
Princeton will bring offensive power of its own to the MAC on Friday. Senior outside hitter and 2011 First Team All-Ivy honoree Lydia Rudnick leads the Ancient Eight with 3.91 kills per set. Freshman outside hitter Kendall Peterkin and junior middle blocker Leah Jordan, who average 2.89 and 1.38 kills per set, respectively, will also challenge the Crimson.
On Saturday, Harvard will have to contend with the defensive prowess of Penn’s Dani Shepherd.  The junior libero and First Team All-Ivy honoree leads NCAA Division I volleyball with 6.61 digs per set this season.  In addition, Quaker freshman stars Ronnie Bither and Alex Caldwell have already won a combined three Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors.
Harvard looks forward to this home stretch after spending much of the month on the road.
“It’s nice to be home,” Weiss said. “Having the home court advantage does matter in the beginning of the Ivies.”
“There’s that extra level of comfort and excitement playing for a home crowd,” Kinsella added.
According to the team, this weekend is when the season really begins for the Crimson.
“These are the games that really matter for our record and for our conference play,” Kinsella said.  “There’s that added pressure of the Ivy League.”
