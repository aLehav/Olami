After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA, PA — With a minute left, and Harvard trailing by six points at the Palestra in a rematch of the 2018 Ivy League Championship, the writing appeared to be on the wall for Harvard men’s basketball. But someone forgot to tell Bryce Aiken that, and what ensued was a performance that left the over five thousand Penn fans in attendance in utter disbelief, as the visitors stormed all the way back to a 75-68 overtime win at the Cathedral of College Basketball.
At some point, words fall short of describing Bryce Aiken’s heroics. Two threes in the final minute of regulation, including a jaw-dropping 30-footer with five seconds left, knotted the game at 61 and sent what had already been an incredible contest into overtime. Just 55 seconds before, Aiken had knocked down a triple to cut the deficit to three points, but he was hardly done, drilling a three-pointer that will likely go down as one of the greatest moments of the season — capping a weekend sweep for the visitors.
Once the Crimson (13-8, 6-2 Ivy) entered the extra period, momentum was firmly in the its hands. Harvard never trailed in the five overtime minutes, as the Quakers (15-9, 3-5) showed signs of fatigue in their second overtime contest in as many nights. The Crimson were able to complete the comeback, winning at the Palestra for the first time in five seasons. Saturday night’s game was more than just another game for Harvard, as the team was able to avenge its Ivy League Championship loss from last season.
“This was a big game for us, this was a redemption game, we had a lot of pain in this building last season,” said sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic, who cited the highlight video playing in the Palestra pregame as extra motivation, which prominently featured clips from last season’s championship game. “We really wanted to come out, play hard, and represent our program, and this was a huge win for us.”
A night after scoring 33 points at Princeton, Aiken tallied a crucial 25, none bigger than the final six points of regulation. Perhaps most impressive about the Randolph, N.J., native’s performance, was the 40 minutes he played, to lead all Harvard players. Just a matter of weeks after returning from injury, there can be no doubt that No. 11 is back to his vintage self, playing with the same swagger and moxie that earned him Ivy League Rookie of the Year two seasons ago.
"Not just all the basketball plays that he makes and obviously they are all key, we have seen that, but his presence gives our team a great deal of confidence,” said Coach Tommy Amaker of having Aiken back in the lineup. “He’s a very confident player and carries himself like that and deservedly so. But it rubs off and becomes contagious with other players and I think that’s as big of a deal in that regard as any.”
Saturday night marked history for Coach Amaker, who registered his 400th victory at the collegiate level. Amaker’s head coaching career has taken him from Seton Hall, to Michigan, and finally to Cambridge. The victory had to be especially sweet for Amaker, who quickly deflected any added emphasis that might be placed on beating Penn.
“Everything’s different you move on to the next situation, next game, next situation,” Amaker said. “There are memories of moments here we have had, we have had some good ones too. Certainly the most recent one last year was not very pleasant one to have.”
Amaker’s 400th victory was in large part due to the Crimson’s three-point shooting, as Aiken and Justin Bassey combined to shoot 11-of-17 from deep, helping the team to a 46 percent mark from three-point territory. Not to overlooked was an absolutely heroic performance from junior wing Justin Bassey, who drilled a remarkable 6-of-8 three-pointers, two more than his previous career high. Bassey also led the team with 11 rebounds, hardly a surprise as he has cemented himself as the team’s most versatile player.
“JB does everything for us, Coach says he’s our most valuable player,” Djuricic said of Bassey. “Like you see tonight, he can have some great offensive nights, he was lights out tonight.”
Just as Harvard excelled from deep, Penn faltered in one of its most important games of the season. With the Quakers entering play at 3-4 in Ivy play, in fifth place in the conference, they were let down by their three-point shooting, which has bailed them out so many times before.
Despite boasting a series of excellent three-point shooters, including Bryce Washington, Devon Goodman, Jake Silpe, Michael Wang, Antonio Woods, and even big man AJ Brodeur, Penn was only able to convert on 7-of-28 triples. Many of the Quakers’ three-point looks were wide-open, and the cold shooting from the field allowed the Crimson to hang around and pull off the comeback.
Washington had a particularly difficult night for Penn. Despite shooting over 40 percent from deep this season, the freshman from Southfield, Mich., was unable to enter the score-sheet, and went 0-of-7 from beyond the arc. More than making up for Washington’s performance, however, was the resilient play of junior AJ Brodeur.
Brodeur’s 23-point performance on Saturday night was almost enough to give the Quakers a crucial second win on the homestand. Were it not for Aiken’s heroics, Brodeur would probably be a shoe-in for Ivy League player of the week -- the Northfield Mount Hermon product scored 36 points Friday night against Dartmouth, and was practically unguardable for much of Saturday’s contest.
“Brodeur was so tough to defend in the post, we had no answers for him,” Amaker said. “I thought we did as best we could to give ourselves a chance and I’m very pleased with the effort that we put forth.”
Brodeur’s matchup with junior forward Chris Lewis was one of the focal points of the duel between the Ancient Eight’s two best teams last season. Lewis started Saturday night slowly, but came into his own in the final minutes and in overtime, scoring several crucial baskets and ultimately finishing with 12 points in 28 minutes.
The statline wasn’t all pretty for the visitors, who incredibly, tallied just four assists. And as Harvard has become well-accustomed to, the four assists accompanied an eye-popping 19 turnovers. Nevertheless, the Crimson was able to persevere on another classic night in the Ivy League. Resiliency, and a willingness to fight back in a game that meant more than just another win in the standings, were what carried Harvard to victory Saturday night.
“It’s been a tremendous weekend for us, with the effort that you need to fight back and claw on the road,” Amaker said. “It’s not easy, but our kids, they deserve a lot of credit.”
The truth of the matter is, the Crimson are two ridiculous Bryce Aiken shots away from a 4-4 Ancient Eight record. But as the old adage goes, the league is won on Saturday nights, and in a results oriented business, the Crimson will happily take the two victories and speed off on I-95 into the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the regular season winds down, the N0. 18/15 Harvard men’s hockey team still has a lot to play for. This past weekend, the Crimson took a trip to upstate New York looking to lock down four crucial conference points.
While Harvard (14-8-3, 10-6-2 ECAC) completed a season sweep of St. Lawrence (4-24-2, 2-14-2), it stumbled against No. 11/10 Clarkson (20-10, 11-7). Timely scoring helped the Crimson pull ahead of the Saints on Friday, but an early lead proved insufficient to best the Golden Knights on Saturday. The loss puts an end to Harvard’s six-game winning streak in conference play. The Crimson is now three points short of first-place Cornell and tied with Clarkson for third, with two weekends of games left.
“It was a frustrating game,” said Harvard head coach Ted Donato ’91 of Saturday’s defeat. “I thought we did enough good things to give ourselves a chance to win the game. But I feel like we gave up too many careless opportunities against…a good team.”
CLARKSON 5, HARVARD 3
The Crimson’s clash against the Golden Knights began much the same way as the last meeting between the teams ended. Just 39 seconds into the contest, freshman Jack Drury won an offensive-zone draw back to sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh at the blue line. Walsh’s seeing-eye shot beat Clarkson junior net-minder Jake Kielly to put Harvard up, 1-0.
But these squads tend to rack up the goals at Cheel Arena, and this game proved no exception. Though the first period ended with a 2-1 Crimson lead courtesy of junior Frédéric Grégoire, the Golden Knights came back roaring in the second, scoring two quick goals to pull ahead. Harvard co-captain Michael Floodstrand evened it at 3-3 shortly thereafter, but the team’s real misfortune came then.
Senior goaltender Michael Lackey was shaken up after a collision at the net front and the coaching staff elected to swap him for junior backstop Cameron Gornet. Lackey (2.23 GAA, .920 SV%) has started all but one game for the Crimson this season, and a late-season run for the team will certainly count on his performance.
To make matters worse for Harvard, Clarkson junior forward Haralds Egle notched the go-ahead tally for the hosts not long after the goalie change. Despite outshooting the Golden Knights 11-6 in the final frame — and 33-26 in the game overall — Harvard could not catch up again. An empty-netter sealed the result, ending the season series against Clarkson in a split.
The Crimson’s inability to pull ahead was not for lack of trying. The team had six power play opportunities but could not find the net on any of them, and has not scored now on 15 straight chances. Instead, Harvard has found recent success on the penalty kill — a sore spot in the squad’s statistics — although its streak of perfect kills ended on Saturday. For a group that has had much success on the offensive end of special teams and owns the best power play efficiency in the country (31.8%), the dry spell is a concern, but also an opportunity to retool.
“The power play’s been great for us all year, and we know that there will be adjustments that need to be made every weekend. We had some looks, just didn’t find the back of the net. We had some good opportunities, we had some good puck movement. But we could’ve certainly used a power play goal tonight.”
HARVARD 3, ST. LAWRENCE 2
The previous day, St. Lawrence offered far more resistance to the Crimson than it did in a 7-3 shellacking in late January. The Saints sit at the very bottom of the ECAC points table this season, but that didn’t stop the team from jumping out the gate.
Harvard has struggled to start on time, especially early on this season, and the visitors were staring at a deficit after St. Lawrence rookie forward David Jankowski bested Lackey just six minutes into the game. Junior Ryan Garvey extended that margin not long after.
“I give them a lot of credit,” coach Donato said. “They gave us everything we could handle, and I thought we battled hard, but they played well. You can see, now that they have a few more healthy bodies, that that’s going to be a very dangerous team in the playoffs.”
The Crimson came back to life after the 2-0 tally. A solid shift in the offensive zone for the top line had Drury circling the net; he centered for his linemates in the slot, and the puck bounced from sophomore forward Henry Bowlby to the waiting stick of rookie Casey Dornbach, who stuffed it short-side.
Dornbach’s goal put him in sole possession of second place in team scoring (6–19—25), a spot he now shares with Walsh. The new-look line comes after former top-line rookie Wyllum Deveaux sat out the Beanpot consolation game after a collision against Union the weekend before.
Harvard threw everything and the kitchen sink at SLU in the middle frame, outshooting the hosts 18-4. Rookie net-minder Emil Zetterquist proved up to the task, however. The squads returned to the ice for the final 20 with the score still at 2-1 in the Saints’ favor.
“I think [SLU] battled physically,” coach Donato said. “Our guys, I think, stayed with it. The puck wasn’t finding the back of the net, [but] we had plenty of chances, hit a few posts, took the game back in the second period.”
Seven minutes into the third, the Crimson continued to pressure, having just killed a penalty and had a shorthanded chance that hit the pipe to boot. Zetterquist fended off a shot from freshman defenseman Jack Rathbone at the point, but the rebound made its way to rookie forward Baker Shore in the slot. The puck was scooped out of the ensuing scrum by co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage, who fired it far-side from the left circle. Zerter-Gossage’s team-leading 14th goal knotted the game up at 2.
As time ticked down and Harvard continued to hold an edge in shots but could not beat Zetterquist, the contest seemed destined for overtime. Until, with 1:22 left on the clock, junior defenseman Adam Fox called for the puck at the top of the left circle and fired the puck towards the net. The screened Zetterquist could not stop the shot from finding the back of the cage after deflecting off Crimson sophomore forward Jack Badini. St. Lawrence pulled its goalie for the 6-on-5 advantage not long after but the 3-2 score held.
“We had a good little cycle going there, and we knew there was only a minute or two left in the game,” said Badini, recounting his game-winning goal. “...I was just trying to go to the net. I didn’t even see [Fox] shoot it, I guess it went off my leg. I’ll take it.”
