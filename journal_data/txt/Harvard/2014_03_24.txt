The frenzy of the Housing Day video drops has finally subsided; Spring has sprung, freshmen wear the swag of their respective houses, and the staggering crop of clips have already started to fade into obscurity. With distance, however, comes esoteric critical reassessment. Arts Blog presents a pretentious analytical examination of the Housing Day videos, complete with stylistic comparisons to famed directors (play clips of the directors’ works simultaneously with the Housing Day videos for optimal effect). Look out later this week for the remaining three installments of our Housing Vid Critique.
 
Adams – Royals
Director of inspiration: Phil Pinto
 


One of the most coveted houses on campus, Adams House gives its incoming sophomore class even more reason to anticipate house life with its excellent rendition of Lorde’s “Royals.” This charming video would fit in perfectly with Phil Pinto’s other works, including music videos for Sleigh Bells’ “Infinity Guitars” and Black Lips’ “Raw Meat.” The refreshingly clear storyline is coupled with intriguing direction, and the hodge-podge of emotive detail is barely but succinctly held together by thematically linked alternating washes of sepia and full color that act as subtle supplements to the driving plot. Tasteful music production by Jamie Dickerson ties together a riveting emotional journey.
 
The parallelism between Adams’ video and Pinto’s alternately frenetic and static camera work in “Infinity Guitars” is overwhelming 
 
 
Currier – What Does the Tree Say?
Director of inspiration: Andrew Adamson


 
The “Shrek” tetralogy is a testament to director Andrew Adamson’s tendency to stick with what works. Currier House also takes this to heart in its arrangement of the viral hit, “What Does the Fox Say?” Though not the most innovative housing day video, “What Does the Tree Say?” has a tireless energy that more than makes up for its tendency to feel strangely like a tired sequel at times. Contemplative shots of singing Currierites are juxtaposed with coordinated dance scenes, turning an empty pop tune into a rewarding short film. At the right times, the songwriters include incisive lines such as “Spread your roots up the hill, / yet you’re always standing still” that add philosophical dexterity to an already multifaceted work.
 
The inspired vocal performances and clever pastiche of Currier’s video evokes “Holding Out For a Hero” from Shrek 2 
 
 
Quincy – “Frozen” medley
Director of inspiration: Todd Phillips


 
Not every set of sequels is successful, however—Todd Phillips’ “Hangover” trilogy comes off as tired rather than inventive. Perhaps it was too obvious—a sitting penguin. Quincy’s mascot lives in the polar regions. In these regions, it is cold. And covering Disney’s “Frozen” soundtrack ties this all together. But this decision unfortunately derails what is, in truth, a work that showcases frustratingly tremendous talent. The video is derivative from the start, opening with a rendition of “Do You Want To Build A Snowman?” that features seven uncomfortably warm-looking Penguins. As the video progresses, not very much changes, and the storm of trite imagery peaks somewhere between singing on top of furniture and iMovie slideshows. The only fact in which Quincy House may take solace is that it wasn’t the only house that made the exact same mistake.
 
The repetitive allusions in Quincy’s video resemble Chow’s tired antics in “The Hangover Part III”

A record release is always a gamble—and in cases like Schoolboy Q’s major-label debut “Oxymoron,” released this month, the game is even more complicated. The Los Angeles rapper’s mixtapes and digital albums have likely done less for his solo career than his membership in the Black Hippy posse with Kendrick Lamar, hip-hop’s Grammy-nominated (ouch) phenomenon of 2013. With “Oxymoron,” Q is out to establish himself as a star independent of his associate’s fame.
 
He’s in good company. This week’s Playlist celebrates four other musicians who came out from behind the shadows of imposing contemporaries:
 
Casey Veggies
The youngest founding member of radical hip-hop collective Odd Future, Veggies released his first mixtape at 14. He left Odd Future shortly thereafter, but is still close with the group, contributing verses to Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, The Creator’s albums while featuring them and other OF members on his mixtapes. In the meantime, tours with Mac Miller and others led him to a management deal with Roc Nation and record deal with Epic, with his first solo album due this year.
 
“PNCINTLOFWGTKA,” and “Hive,” collaborations with other Odd Future members, showcase Veggies’ harder side:

 

 
 
Veggies’ debut album is likely to include more introspective cuts like 2013’s “Baby Don’t Cry”:

 
 
 
 
Alan Parsons
Parsons was a recording engineer for several of rock’s greatest albums—“Abbey Road” was his first assistant engineer credit, followed by “Let It Be,” and his first Grammy nomination was for “The Dark Side of The Moon.” He and manager Eric Woolfson formed the Alan Parsons Project to flip the studio dynamic, with a free-floating collection of musicians under the producers’ purview. With contributions from Parsons-produced bands like Pilot and Ambrosia, the Project’s first album, the Edgar Allen Poe concept record “Tales of Mystery & Imagination,” charted well—with nine subsequent releases for the prog-rock masterminds.
 
 
Clare Torrey’s legendary vocals in Pink Floyd’s  “The Great Gig in the Sky,” were included at Parson’s behest: 

 
 
“The Raven,” a reworking of the Poe poem, is a chilling track from the Project’s debut album: 

 
 
 
 
The Kills
The duo’s first three albums made them indie favorites, leading to a tour with the Jack White-fronted Raconteurs. When White lost his voice, singer Alison Mosshart stepped in; they formed supergroup The Dead Weather with Raconteurs and Queens of the Stone Age members and released two successful albums, while Kills multi-instrumentalist Jamie Hince married Kate Moss. The Kills returned in 2011 with “Blood Presures,” their best record to date and their first to chart in the Top 40. A festival circuit and TV credits followed. This year, they’ll release a new album and tour festivals including Governor’s Ball.
 
Mosshart buoys Dead Weather’s layered and kinetic rock:

 
 
The first single from “Blood Pressures” is stripped down but just as energized: 

 
 
The Band
Levon and the Hawks—that was the band Bob Dylan hired for his first “electric” tour in 1965-6. The well-regarded backing group developed into a creative force under Dylan, and their 1967 debut “Music From Big Pink” secured drummer-vocalist Levon Helm and his ensemble’s place in rock history. Dylan co-wrote three of it’s songs (and painted the indelible cover art), and the record received adoring reviews; The Band’s self-titled follow-up was better than “Abbey Road.”
 
“The Basement Tapes,” a 1975 release of sessions from seven years earlier, is the best aural document of the interplay between Dylan and The Band:

 
 
“The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,” from The Band’s eponymous album, and the first without Dylan’s explicit involvement, exemplifies the group’s fascination with the intersection between Americana and rock:

The stereotype is that Harvard students are an army of necktie-donning robots who would much rather spend their spring break studying for the LSATs than watching sports. That stereotype was proven firmly wrong this week, as Harvard men’s basketball competed in the NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship for the third year in a row. As others may be quick to point out, this is also the fourth time the Crimson has competed in the tournament, period, in the entirety of the program’s history. But while the stereotype of our school may persist, no one can deny that men’s basketball is setting a trajectory for future success—and excellence both inside and outside the classroom.
 
Normally, “athletics” and “Harvard” only come together in the context of the Harvard-Yale Game in the fall. It is fitting that Harvard clinched its ticket to the NCAA Championship with a 70-58 victory at Yale. The team ended the season with a 27-5 overall record, marking the most wins in the program’s history. The team defeated the Cincinnati Bearcats in the first round, thereby advancing to play the Michigan State Spartans.
 
Although Harvard ended up falling 80-73 to Michigan State, the Crimson’s run in the tournament proved that there is more to competition than winning. Thanks to the work of the basketball team over the past three seasons, campus pride has skyrocketed. Last year’s March Madness bid drew student-organized viewings of the game in house common rooms. This year, students and alumni tuned into the big game, and expressed their joy and pride on Facebook and Twitter. Falling in the midst of Harvard’s weeklong spring break, the championship bid provided a unique opportunity for the greater Harvard community to bond without the stress and rigor of academic commitments.
 
While the response to Harvard’s championship run is remarkable, what is more so still is that this run even occurred at all. As an Ivy League institution, Harvard does not provide athletic scholarships to its athletes. All financial aid at Harvard is need-based and all admissions need-blind. We applaud this policy, for it insures that a Harvard education truly is for anyone with the drive to succeed, no matter their background. While such a policy may shrink the pool of interested sport talent, we believe this is a small price to pay in order to make Harvard a more egalitarian institution.
 
Schools that prioritize athletics over academics might mock Harvard’s decision to emphasis the “student” in student-athlete. But as the representative of the Ivy League in the NCAA Championship this year, and therefore the representative of the Ivy’s unique method of enrolling athletes, Harvard has done well. By defeating the Cincinnati Bearcats, seeded 5th to Harvard’s 12th, the Crimson has shown that student-athletes can be just as passionate and skillful as athletes from other schools.
 
But pride in securing a place at the NCAA tournament should not be used as an excuse to compromise academic priorities. Harvard's reputation has always been one of scholastic quality, and this must not be sacrificed simply to fill our rosters with talent that only expresses itself on the court. While the Crimson values holistic development of students in both the arts and athletics, the expectation should be that all students can compete in the classroom as well. It is comforting to know that in spite of the pressure of athletic recruiting, coaches maintain a respect for academic requirements as well, and we hope this will continue to be the case.
 
 We hope that Harvard’s victories will provide a compelling case defending its admission and recruitment policies. By saving scholarship dollars for students who actually need financial assistance, Harvard has proven that it can remain true to its principles while also managing to produce a dedicated and winning athletic team. We hope that the last three years are just a taste of what the future will bring, and will inspire more school spirit. Go Crimson!

Forty-six million young people are eligible to vote, while only 39 million seniors are eligible to vote. Yet, campaigns always seem to care more about what the senior citizens say.  
Why?  
Because they vote.  
Of those eligible to vote in 2012, only 45 percent of citizens aged 18-29 voted, the “millennial” generation, as opposed to 72 percent of those over the age of 65. Additionally, voter turnout among millennials has actually decreased by six percentage points from 2008 to 2012, while turnout among seniors increased by two percentage points over the same period. Until that trend changes, elected officials will not address the issues that most affect the millennial generation—the cost of entitlements, the high cost of education, and the overall lack of investment in the future.  
According to the Social Security Administration, there were 2.9 workers for each retiree in 2012—in 2035 that number will fall to 2.1 workers per retiree and the ratio will continue to decline from there. Additionally, the fund will be exhausted in 2033, requiring either greater taxes on young people to recapitalize the fund or a reduction in benefits. Either one will dramatically affect the financial stability of millennials as they try to make their own way in the world.  
In order to get lawmakers to focus on the policies that most impact the generation born between 1980 and 2000, young people must become more engaged in the political process, not only by voting but also by volunteering with campaigns and speaking out on issues of importance.  But that doesn’t seem to be the case. A poll conducted by Bipartisan Policy Center and USA Today on attitudes toward public service found that while 62 percent of young people say that giving back to their communities is either very important or one of the most important activities, only 17 percent are interested in writing a letter or email on a political issue. 
Young people should be commended for the rate at which they volunteer in their communities and use social media to bring awareness to causes, but we need them to engage in the political process as well. For the past year, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Commission on Political Reform has been exploring issues related to the dysfunction of our electoral and legislative systems. 
We believe this dysfunction has contributed to apathy among young voters. Addressing the apathy requires us to fix our democracy.  A recent Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that nearly 59 percent of young people under the age of 30 agreed that elected officials are motivated by selfish reasons. And only 35 percent believe that running for office is an honorable thing to do.  
  
On March 26, the commission is holding the final session in a series of National Conversations on American Unity at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, in partnership with the library, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, and USA Today. This meeting will focus on congressional reform. Previous events in the series held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, and the Ohio State University examined the root causes of political dysfunction and obstacles to public service as well as reforms to our electoral system.  
The Commission on Political Reform was formed to investigate the causes and consequences of America’s partisan political divide, to address the dysfunction and gridlock resulting from the polarized atmosphere, and to develop and champion specific, concrete reforms. The commission will release its findings on June 24 in Washington, DC.  
Throughout these town hall meetings, the commission has heard from every generation, especially young people disenchanted with their government. We are very concerned that the only model of democracy that today’s high school and college students have seen is one of government shutdowns, partisan name calling, and political showdowns. This is not the government for which we once worked, but we know that with just a few changes, it can once again be the beacon of hope it once was for countries the world over. In the meantime, young people need to run for office, help those who are running, vote in large numbers, and make their voices heard. They need to give lawmakers the courage they require to tackle these incredibly difficult public policy problems.  
In the short term, please join us on Wednesday at the Kennedy Presidential Library or tune in online on the Bipartisan Policy Center’s website and become a Citizen for Political Reform at www.bipartisanpolicy.org. 
Demand better of your government. Help restore order and sanity to our political system. 
Former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson ’94 is the director of Harvard's Institute of Politics and a member of the Presidential Commission on Election Administration. Former US Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman is co-chair of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Commission on Political Reform and previously served as director of Harvard’s Institute of Politics.

It’s the first day of class after spring break. First-years are still giddy about their housing assignments; sophomores and juniors have started scoping out desirable suites for this spring’s room lottery. House pride at Harvard is real and strong. But what are the limitations of the House system—and what would happen if more students were to move off-campus? 
As every Harvard undergraduate was reminded this month, all Houses were not created equal. Physical structures determine many of the differences between houses: Mather guarantees sophomore singles; Adams, Lowell, and Quincy are close to the Yard; Eliot and Winthrop boast back gates onto the River. These are not simply aesthetic matters. Only a few houses include the option of living in the DeWolfe apartments, which boast kitchens and air-conditioning. Even fewer houses are wheelchair accessible. 
But much more of the difference between houses is due to house culture—and culture is largely shaped by Masters. In 1929, President Lowell wrote about the importance of House Masters, noting, “The atmosphere, the aspirations, the enjoyment of the Houses, will take their tone from them.” House masters decide what events to host, which speakers to invite, and what tutors to hire. They also decide whether to implement gender-neutral housing. This affects the quality of life of the sophomores, juniors, and seniors in each House—and can reinforce inequalities that fall hardest on students of color, queer students, and working-class students. 
Harvard emphasizes how integral the houses are to the undergraduate experience. Indeed, those who see their friends weekly at Stein Clubs and babysit tutors’ kids undoubtedly get a lot out of their House life. But for others, living in a dorm with hundreds of other undergraduates, tutors, and house masters who may not share their interests or values can be unpleasant, stressful, and anxiety-producing. 
What would happen if students who dislike their House simply moved out? 
Leaving your House is not nearly as easy as it sounds. The difficulty of transferring has frustrated undergraduates for years—as the Crimson explored last week, many students who apply for house transfers are denied. But transferring is not the only way to leave your house: after their first year, undergraduates also have the option of moving off-campus.
Living in an apartment or multi-story home near Harvard Square may seem a daunting prospect for some—and indeed, if you hate cooking and enjoy having clean laundry delivered to your door weekly by HSA, off-campus life is not for you. For me, though, despite my tutor’s repeated discouragement, moving to an apartment near Inman Square has been vital to my senior year wellness and happiness. Off-campus life has not only let me experience the vibrancy of the Cambridge community, it also makes me feel calmer and more centered.
Even those who move off-campus officially belong to a House, so more students living off-campus would not upset the administrative structures that currently depend on the Houses—from the resident deans and tutors to UC representation to intramurals. I’ve encouraged my friends to move off-campus, too—but I’ve begun to wonder whether my decision to live in an apartment is truly scalable.
Living in an apartment walking distance from Harvard Yard is not nearly as expensive as it’s made out to be. If you’re willing to share common spaces and cook your meals instead of going out, it’s very easy to survive on much less than the $14,100 per semester that Harvard’s room and board costs. Nonetheless, financial considerations confine many to the Houses. 
Perhaps Harvard’s existing model for alternative housing could be scaled-up. The Dudley Cooperative House, which is owned by Harvard, actually costs about $3000 less per year than traditional housing. The Co-op caters to those who desire a culture of co-habitation, complete with vegetarian dinners and collective decision-making. Harvard could hypothetically buy up more property to create more co-ops and similar living situations. Yet previous expansions of Harvard-held housing options have displaced long-time Cambridge residents from their homes, reduced the amount of mixed-income housing in our city, and driven market rent rates upwards.
Neither would it be ideal for Harvard undergraduates to move en masse to off-campus apartments. Across the river, long-term Allston residents are plagued by transient Boston University students who host loud parties and have little commitment to neighborhood development or community.
The House system is wonderful for many reasons. The fact that all students live in the same housing and eat from the same meal plan, regardless of class background, certainly fosters the image of an inclusive and diverse campus. Yet the Houses are not right for everyone. Undergraduates who are less than pleased with their randomly-assigned House assignment should not silence their discontent in the name of House pride. 
Whether it’s implementing a more streamlined and sympathetic transfer system, exploring allocations of financial aid that can make living off-campus affordable, or encouraging unhappy students to move off-campus, tutors and advisers can do a better job than they do today of addressing the problems of house life. It would be a shame if fear of missing out on an “important Harvard experience” led undergraduates to continue living in a place that made them unhappy.

Charles D. Baker ’79 clinched the Republican nomination for governor at the party convention Saturday, edging out Mark Fisher, a more conservative Republican candidate, for the gubernatorial nomination.
 
As a result, Baker will be the only Republican candidate to appear on the ballot during the September primary.
 
The decision to let Baker run uncontested in the Republican primary may give him a leg up by allowing him to focus on gathering support for the general election rather than working to fend off a conservative challenger.
 
“He can now run a general election [campaign] between now and November,” said Mary Anne Marsh, a democratic strategist for the Dewey Square Group’s Boston office. “That’s always an advantage. He won’t be having the Tea Party Republicans nipping at his heels like he would have if Fisher had made the ballot.”
 
Karyn E. Polito, a former state representative for the 11th Worcester District, received the nomination for lieutenant governor at the convention Saturday. Polito ran against Steve Grossman for state treasurer in 2010, and, although defeated, drew the highest vote count of any Republican candidate statewide.
 
Polito brings some political baggage to the race for lieutenant governor.
 
During the 2010 election cycle, Polito was accused of allegedly misusing her influence to secure rare Red Sox commemorative license plates for family and friends, according to the Boston Globe.
 
The Democrats may bring up the controversy again to tarnish her reputation, or they may also refrain from targeting the candidates and instead focus on lambasting national Republican policy.
 
According to former Boston City Councilor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71, the Democratic Party will likely attempt to align Baker with national Republican policy rather than going after his personal and political beliefs.
 
DiCara noted that if the Democrats manage to portray Baker as a more conservative Republican, he may have trouble attracting swing voters.
 
The Democratic convention will not take place until June, but the field of Democratic gubernatorial candidates has already grown competitive.
 
Marsh said she expects two or three candidates to secure the delegates needed to appear on the Democratic primary ballot.  She expects the ballot to include Martha M. Coakley, Grossman, and Juliette N. Kayyem ’91—three candidates with high levels of public, financial, and delegate support.
 
Recent polls showed Baker to have more public support than all Democratic candidates except Coakley, who led Baker by 13 points.
 
“Republicans benefit time and time again by not having a lot of primaries,” DiCara said. “He is as prepared to be governor as anyone who has ever run for governor in the state of Massachusetts. He got today what the Democrats won’t have for almost seven and a half months. Now he can focus on the demographics he needs to.”

Harvard Business School formally announced Friday that it will enter the online education market, unveiling HBX, a new digital learning platform that will provide business-focused online courses for students and professionals not enrolled in the Business School.
While the initiative aims to open the school’s curriculum to students around the world, it differs significantly from existing MOOC—massive open online course—platforms like edX or Coursera, involving both a selective admissions process and a tuition requirement for enrollees. Courses offered under the platform will model the participation-centered discussion central to the case method style used in classrooms in the Business School.
“Moreover, HBX will provide a powerful channel for communicating ideas to and engaging with new and wider audiences, complementing the work we do through Harvard Business Publishing,” Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said in a statement.
The platform will also bring a new revenue-generating branch to the Business School at a time when it is facing growing constraints in revenue derived from its executive education and publishing programs.
The initial offering of HBX, entitled “Credential of Readiness,” or “CORe,” will comprise three courses on business analytics, accounting, and management economics, and will be taught by Business School faculty members.
Enrollment for CORe will be restricted to between 500 and 1,000 students from institutions of higher learning in Massachusetts, but will eventually expand to address undergraduates, graduate students in non-business fields, and young business professionals.
The first term of the course is scheduled to begin in June, and the school will provide applications in April. The course will cost $1,500, according to the Boston Globe.
The announcement indicated that HBX will later this year add courses on topics such as entrepreneurship, the microeconomics of competitiveness, and disruptive innovation and growth strategy. The Business School is also developing HBX Live, a space that will allow for virtual engagement, which is being developed in partnership with public broadcaster WGBH in Boston.
While HBX will be a distinct platform from edX and HarvardX, a University-wide initiative to support faculty members in developing digital tools for instruction, the three services could potentially share technologies and best practices, according to Brian C. Kenny, chief marketing and communications officer at the Business School.
“The X in all of these initiatives underscores the intended synergies between them—namely best practice and research,” he wrote in an email. “There is already a good amount of information sharing and collaboration between the 3 entities.”
 
HBX, Kenny wrote, will employ online tools customized to the teaching style of the school. Notably, students will be digitally “cold called” to answer a topical question in a limited amount of time, as they are in a traditional classroom setting at the Business School.
 
According to Regina E. Herzlinger, a Business School professor and the instructor of the edX course entitled “Innovating Health Care,” such features are necessary to duplicate the level of engagement and energy typically found in an MBA classroom.
 
“We have to have standards in a case-based platform where we can view the interaction in the classroom as to be about being a productive, prepared, creative, and supportive meddler of the group,” she said. “These are the things that make a course more involving than just sitting in front of a monitor or reading a case.”
 
Bloomberg first reported that the Business School was developing an online learning initiative in the fall. The Crimson reported at the time that the platform had been in development since at least June 2013.

John Briscoe, a Harvard professor who specializes in water management and economic development, received the 2014 Stockholm Water Prize, a prestigious award for achievement in water policy and administration, on Friday.
Briscoe was honored as the Stockholm Water Prize Laureate “for his unparalleled contributions to global and local water management, inspired by an unwavering commitment to improving the lives of people on the ground,” according to a press release by the Stockholm International Water Institute.
Briscoe earned a Ph.D. in environmental engineering from Harvard in 1976 and returned to Harvard as a faculty member in 2009. He currently holds appointments at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Public Health, and the Kennedy School. He teaches undergraduate and graduate-level water management and development courses and has been nominated for prizes for exceptional teaching and mentoring of Harvard students.
The Stockholm Water Prize Committee stated that Briscoe “has combined world-class research with policy implementation and practice to improve the development and management of water resources, as well as access to safe drinking water and sanitation,” according to the press release.
Briscoe’s career, which has focused on water management issues and economic development, spans nearly four decades and multiple continents. He has worked as an epidemiologist in Bangladesh, an engineer for the government of Mozambique, and a country director for the World Bank in Brazil.
Briscoe said he was “completely surprised” when heard he had won the Stockholm Prize.
“I feel the award to me is a recognition of a class of people who work on water—practitioners with one foot in practice and another foot in ideas,” Briscoe said. “I’m a representative of these ‘thinking practitioners.’”
Originally from South Africa, Briscoe said his home country provided him with the formative experiences for his later work. In addition to growing up in a semi-arid region of South Africa with “an acute sense of water scarcity,” Briscoe said he came of age during the era of apartheid.
“My mother ran an orphanage and day-care center in Soweto, and as a child I was inculcated with a sense of tremendous inequality and a quest for the rights of people to develop,” he said.
Founded in 1991, Stockholm Water Prize honors “individuals or organizations whose work contributes broadly to the conservation and protection of water resources and to improved well-being of the planet’s inhabitants and ecosystems,” according to the Stockholm International Water Institute’s website. The Stockholm Water Prize Laureate receives $150,000 and a crystal sculpture.
 
The king of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, will present Briscoe with the prize during the 2014 World Water Week in Stockholm in September.

Sarah Kay, a spoken word poet known for her TED talks, performed some of her latest work in honor of the official release of her new book for a full house at the Oberon theater Sunday night.
The poetry collection, entitled “No Matter the Wreckage,” includes poetry written within the last decade, beginning when she was 14.
Hosted by comedian Lori Strauss, the launch event had both emotional and humorous moments. Kay, along with friends and artists such as poet Laura Lamb Brown-Lavoie and singer Kayla Ringelheim, presented poems on a range of topics, including love, pain, and womanhood.
She recounted stories of her first love, New York City roots, and passion for teaching.
“The thing I love about Sarah is [not only] her poetic genius, but the stories she has to tell,” said TEDGlobal Fellow and guitarist Usman Riaz, who also joined Kay at the launch event.
A graduate of Brown University, Kay founded Project V.O.I.C.E., a movement to encourage students worldwide to express themselves through spoken word poetry, in 2004. Her widely popular TED talk, entitled “If I Should Have a Daughter,” has been viewed over five million times online. She appears in a number of other YouTube videos with similar success.
“I am always excited about poetry,” Kay said. “I continue to be excited by this book and that people continue to be excited to hear poetry.”
Despite her online success, Kay said she still faced many obstacles in the process of creating “No Matter the Wreckage.” 
“I write spoken word to be performed,” Kay said. “I had to find a way to put my poems on paper in such a way that when you would read them it sounds to the reader the way I intended.”
Kay previously published a book entitled “B,” which is a transcription of her TED talk “If I Should Have a Daughter.”
When teaching at workshops around the world, Kay said she is frequently asked about her writing process and difficulties she faces as a writer. She often jokingly offers wisdom to her younger students.
“A poem is like pooping. If the poem is inside you, it has to come out,” Kay said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Graduate School of Education student Geoff E. Marietta has collaborated with MIT game developer Jeff Orkin to create “SchoolLife,” a video game designed to reduce bullying in the classroom. The idea for the game has attracted attention and acclaim in the past year, winning the 2013 Harvard Education Innovation Contest and earning a $150,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.
The game features a 3D virtual school environment in which players assume the roles of simulated bullying victims and bystanders.  SchoolLife enables players to interact with these various characters and gain insight into their emotions and social skills.
SchoolLife developed out of Marietta and Orkin’s creation in May 2013 of GiantOtter Technologies, a company that creates “data-driven models of personality, social interaction, and communication, for applications in simulation, assessment, education, and games,” according to the company’s official website.
“Educating kids about anti-bullying social skills seemed like a natural application of my technology,” Orkin said.
SchoolLife is the first development out of Marietta and Orkin’s larger “SocialLife” platform, which will ultimately include other projects like “RestaurantLife” and “OfficeLife.” RestaurantLife will allow those with neurological impairments to practice everyday social interactions in a restaurant, while OfficeLife will allow players to assess personality traits through common social interactions in the workplace, according to Orkin.
The pitch for SchoolLife was one of the winners of the 2013 Harvard Education Innovation Contest, and also a winner of the MIT iGame Entrepreneurial Competition.
“When I found out that I was one of the winners I felt that my idea had been validated,” said Marietta. “It was worth the time and resources to make the idea reality.”
Marietta’s idea to create a virtual game that addressed these issues of bullying also earned the company a Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Grant from the NSF in January.
After receiving the 6-month grant, Marietta worked with Orkin to develop the initial structure of the video game.
“We contracted a professional 3D animation studio in Seattle (Turnstyle Studios, who has previously worked on Harry Potter and Stuart Little franchises) to create the 3D artwork,” Orkin said. “We have also worked with a local interactive narrative designer, Adam Singer, to refine the script.”
SchoolLife is still an ongoing process, according to Marietta, as he and Orkin are refining the design by pilot testing different versions in schools across the country and meeting with anti-bullying experts.
The pilot version of the game is currently accessible through any web browser, and will be available on Android and iOS mobile applications soon.
Marietta and Orkin said they hope for widespread adoption of the game and a measurable improvement of social relationships in schools.
“We hope to inspire a new game-based approach to social-emotional learning,” said Orkin.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Molecular and Cellular Biology concentration will revamp its requirements and extracurricular programming to allow concentrators greater flexibility and incorporate recent “astonishing changes in biomedical research,” MCB head tutors Susan Mango and Rachelle Gaudet announced in an email to concentrators on Monday.
MCB, one of the nine concentrations that make up the Life Sciences cluster, will also undergo a name change to reflect these revisions, which, along with the other changes, will take effect this coming fall. Mango and Gaudet will solicit recommendations from faculty, concentrators, and other members of the Harvard community as they search for a “more accurate name,” Mango said.
“We thought it would be fun to change it because we have made such sweeping changes to the concentration,” Mango said. “We will crowdsource to get suggestions and then think about what would be a good descriptor of our new curriculum.”
The culmination of a year and a half’s work, the revisions to MCB’s course offerings aim to emphasize the link between basic research and its practical applications to biomedicine and human disease. Updates to the MCB programming follow the release of the Life Sciences Review, an evaluation of the cluster six years after its formation.
To increase flexibility for concentrators, MCB will offer a modified gateway course for sophomores in the fall, MCB 60: “Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine,” which will replace MCB 52: “Molecular Biology.” Instead of requiring concentrators to take MCB 54: “Cell Biology,” concentrators can choose from a broader selection of four intermediate courses, which will make up the newly created MCB 60 series. Each class will have a slightly different disciplinary focus, ranging from cell biology to physical biochemistry.
“We’re trying to provide a spectrum of options that progressively increases, so there is more flexibility in the new curriculum,” Gaudet said.
The new MCB concentration will also accept summer research experience for credit instead of the current system, in which all concentrators are required to complete term-time research.
“We’ve realized we have so many outstanding summer programs, and summer programs are full-time immersion into research,” Gaudet said. “They are just as valuable as a course where you spend a quarter of your time immersed in research.”
Since they no longer need to take a research class during the semester, concentrators will have an opportunity to take an additional intermediate, advanced, or research course, further increasing the amount of choice students have in their plan of study. Recognizing summer research for academic credit will also encourage students to take advantage of well-established fellowships like the Harvard College Program for Research in Science and Engineering and other approved programs.
“Having a summer experience is more than equal to a term-time research position,” MCB concentrator Yucheng Pan ’15 said.
In addition to academic changes, MCB will also provide greater extracurricular opportunities for students to engage with related areas of biology and the MCB community. Concentration advisors will work to facilitate student-faculty relationships through dinners in undergraduate houses and other mentorship events. Mango and Gaudet cited movie nights and debates about conflicting research papers as examples of related new programming.
“We want students to have the skill of being able to keep current,” Mango said. “It’s the informed citizen concept, whether they become scientists, or doctors, or go into policy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council considered and passed two policy orders designed to benefit the city’s least advantaged residents at their meeting Monday night. One proposed a Cambridge-wide job fair and another explored the possibility of introducing free internet access across the city.
The first resolution, proposed by Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan, aims to launch a job fair exclusively for Cambridge residents.  According to Benzan, the fair would serve to connect the top 25 regional employers, start-ups, and other companies to the local talent of Cambridge.
Benzan hopes that such a job fair would reduce unemployment as well as bolster economic growth for Cambridge. “We have the capacity to reduce our unemployment rate from 4.3 percent to almost 0,” he said.
Several Cambridge residents showed their support for the resolution. During the portion of the meeting for public comments, they noted that it is difficult to find jobs despite the seemingly strong economic prospects of the major companies that call Cambridge home.
The council members concurred that a job fair could help promote the employment of Cambridge youth and, in particular, encourage them to stay in the area after attending high school or college.
The council also considered a resolution to create a task force to investigate the possibility of offering free municipal broadband to Cambridge residents. The resolution, which was proposed by Councilors Nadeem A. Mazen, Leland Cheung, and Dennis J. Carlone argued that Cambridge is dominated by a single broadband provider, Comcast, and thus lacks the competition that would normally lead to affordable pricing.
If the task force decides in favor of municipal broadband, Cambridge residents who would otherwise be unable to afford internet access would be able to enjoy free or subsidized broadband service.
Residents also came out in support of this resolution, with one calling the lack of affordable internet access a “human rights violation.” They said that in the digital age, having access to the internet is crucial for civic engagement, education, and employment opportunities.
The resolution noted that over 400 communities across the United States have already implemented and managed their own municipal broadband networks, often operating them in competition with private firms.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team (3-11) traveled to Winter Haven, Fla on Tuesday to duke it out against UConn and North Dakota State in three contests. After dropping its first game to the Huskies, the Crimson split two games against the Bison, clinching a win in its third and final contest, 2-1.
"UConn and NDSU games really tested our identity as a team and our resolve," freshman pitcher Kevin Rex said.
The trip to Winter Haven followed a similar three-day stint in Greenville, S.C., when Harvard dropped its first two contests but tallied a victory in its final game against North Dakota State.
HARVARD 2, NORTH DAKOTA STATE 1
Harvard rallied against the Bison and clinched a victory to close out its Winter Haven stretch. The Crimson shut out North Dakota State after the opponent’s single score in the first, while Harvard responded to tie the game up in the next inning. A run in the top of the seventh allowed the Crimson a lead for the remainder of the contest.
“We realized we mentally broke down and were sluggish [in the first game], so we got it out of our system,” said junior pitcher and infielder Tanner Anderson. “We came back and were like, ‘You know what? We are going to take it to these guys and take a win off of them,’ and we played much better—all-around defense was better, pitching was better, hitting was better.”
Senior pitcher Matt Timony (W, 2-2) pitched seven full innings, causing two strikeouts and allowing zero walks. Credited with a save, Anderson (Sv, 3) took the mound for the final two innings, forcing two strikeouts. The junior also tallied an RBI after a double to left field in the top of the second to tie the contest.
Despite striking out at two of his four at bats, senior second baseman Kyle Larrow drew a walk and hit a single that allowed Harvard to grab the run that would win the game.
In contrast to the prior contest against the Bison, the Crimson only allowed one error rather than six.
 "We knew we needed to respond the next day with much better execution on all sides of the ball," Rex said."The offense did a great job to take the lead and then the bullpen slammed the door in the late innings to secure a good team win heading into the Army series."
NORTH DAKOTA STATE 15, HARVARD 2
Failing to rebound from the previous day’s loss, Harvard went down by 15 runs by the top of the fourth inning. The Crimson only tallied two runs, and the contest was called after the seventh inning.
“To be pretty truthful, I think that day we didn’t come out to play,” Anderson said. “We were pretty sluggish. It was one of those Florida-hot days, and we didn’t come out with enough energy, and they took advantage of it.”
Harvard responded to four early runs from the Bison with a run of its own, but North Dakota State held the Crimson scoreless until the sixth inning. While Harvard failed to put up numbers on the scoreboard, the defense tallied six errors.
“They laid up a bunch of runs on us,” Anderson said. “They laid [the runs] up pretty quickly, so we began to shut down. That game was tough. We’ll be okay with a loss by one or two runs, but that was a bit over-the-top.”
A single to centerfield from junior outfielder Jack Colton allowed junior outfielder Mike Martin to register a run in the sixth inning, but the offense lacked a final surge to close the scoring gap. Colton finished the day 2-for-3 at bat, along with junior first baseman Nick Saathoff. The first baseman also registered an RBI with a single through the right side in the first.
Five pitchers took the mound for the Crimson, with freshman Kevin Rex (L, 0-1) starting the day pitching two innings.
UCONN 9, HARVARD 4
After holding a two-run lead for three innings, the Crimson defense slipped, allowing seven runs against UConn in the sixth and seventh innings. The lead came after Harvard tallied three runs at the top of the third, but the Crimson remained scoreless for the remainder of the contest, which ended in a 9-4 loss.
“UConn could hit the ball pretty good—they were swinging,” Anderson said. “Half their lineup could hit pretty good balls. We played some pretty decent defense behind them. To be honest, I think that day things weren’t really falling our way.”
Junior outfielder Brandon Kregel grabbed a double and tallied two RBIs for Harvard in the third inning, with the other two runs being batted in by Colton. Also chipping in two stolen bags, sophomore infielder Mitch Klug helped progress the Crimson offense.
Starting on the mound for Harvard, senior pitcher Danny Moskovits forced three strikeouts over the course of five innings. Five additional Crimson pitchers saw mound time during the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before returning home from its spring break trip to California, the Harvard women’s tennis team underwent one final tune-up Saturday afternoon.
Presumably playing in its last outdoor match for a few weeks, the No. 37 ranked Crimson (7-4) fell to Long Beach State (12-2) at the Rhodes Tennis Center, 4-3.
The match wrapped up a busy week for Harvard, in which the team took the court three times. Earlier on the trip, the Crimson split a pair of matches with Cal State Northridge (6-5) and San Diego State (6-9).
“Overall, I’m proud of the way the team competed this entire week,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “We got a lot of tough matches in, and our goal was to improve every match, and we did that.”
On Saturday, looking to avoid losing consecutive matches for the first time all season, the Crimson did not get the start it was looking for.
In doubles play, the 49ers’ freshman pair of Maeva Razakasoa and Hayley Thompson got things started with a win on court two over June Lee and Hannah Morrill, 8-4. Then, Laura Eales and Ebba Unden managed to knock off the No. 63 ranked twosome of Spencer Liang and Monica Lin, earning the first point of the match for Long Beach State.
“Spencer and Monica are a dynamic duo,” Green said. “When they’re on, they’re very tough to beat. They were grinding today—[really] all three days—but today just didn’t go their way.”
Harvard did have some success at the third doubles position, where Amanda Lin and Amy He led Karolina Rozenberg and Holly Reid, 5-3. But the sophomore duo did not get a chance to finish its match since the 49ers had already locked up the point.
LBSU carried its momentum right into singles play. On court five, Thompson added onto her team’s lead, earning a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Morrill. Next, Julie Gerard defeated Lee, 6-2, 6-2, at the third singles position, putting the Crimson in a large hole.
Nonetheless, with its back against the wall, Harvard came crawling back. At the sixth singles position, Amanda Lin got the Crimson on the board, notching a 6-2, 6-1 win over Reid, prompting flashbacks to the team’s come-from-behind victory over Clemson back in February.
But this time, history would not repeat itself. The 49ers sealed the contest on Court Four, where Rozenberg defeated He, 7-5, 6-2, giving Long Beach State its third win of the week.
But even with the outcome of the match already having been determined, Harvard continued to fight. After falling as a doubles pair, Liang and Monica Lin made sure not to experience the same fate in singles play.
Court one featured a matchup between two of the game’s top freshmen—the Crimson’s Liang, who is ranked No. 107 in the nation, and the 49ers’ Razakasoa, who entered the match with an 11-1 record on the year. In what proved to be the longest match of the afternoon, Liang outlasted her opponent and came out on top, 6-3, 7-6(5).
One court over, Monica Lin also came up with a win for Harvard. Matched up against Unden, the Crimson freshman won a first set tiebreak before going on to win, 7-6 (4), 6-4. The victory for Monica Lin extends her unbeaten streak at the second singles position to eight games.
Despite the loss Saturday and the team’s 1-2 record over the course of the trip, Green said she was pleased with the effort her team put forth in the Golden State.
“Our team was trying to change from indoor to outdoor tennis, and we got a lot of tough matches in,” Green said. “Each person competed hard, and that’s what we wanted to get out of this trip, so overall, it was a successful trip. We didn’t get as many W’s as we would like, but overall, it definitely got us one step closer to being prepared for Ivy [League play].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s winter track season was defined by broken records. Week after week, Harvard runners and field competitors etched their names in the record books, and after the first meet of the spring season it seems like nothing has changed.
This weekend, the Crimson track and field program headed to Houston, Tex., to compete at the Texas Southern Relays. Overall, three program records fell or were matched over the two days of competition. The men and women combined for eight first place finishes, with the women excelling on the track and the men impressing on the field.
“We go down to Texas each year primarily for the warm weather, some spring training, and it’s nice to also have a competition while we’re down there,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “The way our student athletes competed and the performances they were able to achieve were nothing short of spectacular.”
The transition to the spring season also includes a shift of some events. On the track, some of the sprint events change distances while in the field, athletes compete in the hammer throw, discus, and javelin, which is different from the winter season.
During the winter season, junior Danielle Barbian broke her own record multiple times in the 60-meter dash, ending the season with a time of 7.44 in the Ivy championship race. In Texas, Barbian added her name once more for the 100-meter dash record, claiming the top of the podium with a time of 11.65. Junior Ashley Collinsworth may not have been able to catch up to her teammate, but her third place finish of 11.83 seconds put her at third in the Harvard record books and was a personal best.
Barbian and Collinsworth also joined freshman Sylvia Deppen and sophomore Autumne Franklin for the first place 4x100 meter relay. The team crossed the line in a program-record 46.27 seconds, a mark that Franklin and the Crimson intend to lower come the championship season.
“[The record] is not really in my head because my goal right now isn’t to break any records in the first meet,” Franklin said. “For the 4x100, our record was really, really, slow and we intend to demolish it, so breaking the record doesn’t really resonate with us…. We know we can do so much better than that.”
On the individual side, Franklin was victorious in the 400-meter hurdles with a time of 59.25, edging out teammate freshman Jackie Modesett by a little over a second.
Franklin and Modesett weren’t the only teammates to stand together in the top three.
On the men’s side, junior Ben Glauser and senior Dustin Brode took first and third, respectively, in the hammer throw.
In the shot put, Brode and junior Igor Liokumovich took first and second.
Junior Malcolm Mason Rodriguez and freshman Efe Uwaifo took the second and third spots in the triple jump.
With the outdoor season in full swing for the track program, runners and throwers must transition to competing in the elements. While it doesn’t feel like spring yet in Cambridge, the Texas heat was an issue on the second day of competition. Wind was a factor in the evening events.
“The first day, the weather was pretty perfect—you couldn’t complain about it,” Franklin said. “The second day it was really hot. You had to modify your warm ups, drink a lot more water, and kind of not let the exhaustion get to you.”
Harvard athletes took advantage of the few bye weeks following the indoor championship meets. After an intense period of training, the Crimson began the outdoor season perhaps a little sorer than usual.
“If anything, I like to have a lighter schedule when we get to the season because you have to kind of get used to it and its also some time to get some really good training in,” Franklin said. “I was joking with my teammates saying that it felt like fall training all over again the week after Heps because everything we did hurt.”
The team will compete next in the Snowflake Classic next weekend at Tufts. The meet will give the athletes a chance to compete locally before spending most of the season on the road.
“We as a coaching staff take a very concerted effort to make sure our student athletes have the right balance,” Saretsky said. “We pick and choose our spots wisely so that we’re not on the road too much. We are very selective about who competes where.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s water polo team wrapped up its 10 game California road trip with losses to two top-ranked teams.
UC Santa Barbara 12, Harvard 9
Rounding out its West Coast tour, the Crimson (11-13, 0-1 Ivy) came close but could not close the door against the No. 16 Gauchos (9-11).
“I think we really wanted to beat a top twenty team, but I think we worked really hard and gave it our all,” co-captain Shayna Price said. “Playing West Coast teams makes us better in our all-around play because it makes us more aggressive and more physical. We learned what it takes to be a top water polo program.”
With the loss, the team ended its spring break trip 3-7.
UCLA 18, Harvard 7
Facing off against the No. 2 ranked Bruins (18-2), the Crimson knew that the team was in for tough competition.
“When you schedule a team like UCLA you’re scheduling it for a couple reasons,” Minnis said. “The atmosphere of playing there is awesome, having the opportunity to see where they’re at and maybe see[ing] things they do that we don’t do—how they warm up, what they are doing on offense, and what they are doing on defense—that we can take back with us.”
UCLA jumped out to a quick lead at Spieker Aquatics Center and did not look back. Junior attacker Emily Donohoe led the Bruins with four goals while sophomore Rachel Fattal and senior Becca Dorst also finished the game with hat tricks.
By halftime, the Bruins were up 9-3, and put in backup goaltender Alex Musselman for redshirt junior starter and U.S. National Team member Sami Hill. With Hill out of the net, the Crimson outscored UCLA, 3-2, in the third quarter.
Despite Harvard’s brief offensive push, the Bruins responded with seven goals in the final eight minutes of play.
“I think it’s really all about the mistakes we make,” Price said. “Whether it’s not getting up on our legs when we shoot or making a pass not perfect, these are the things that top teams are going to capitalize on and take the ball the other way. It’s a lot of little details that we need to work on to play perfect water polo.”
The Harvard offense was led by senior Jelena Cyr, who tallied two goals in the game. Freshmen Melissa Balding, Zoe Osbourne, Michelle Martinelli, junior Kalina Grabb, and Price all added a goal in the loss. Five different Crimson players tallied assists in the game.
On the defensive side of the ball, junior goaltender Ariel Dukes had five saves and two steals in goal for Harvard. Sophomore Charlotte Hendrix, Price, Martinelli and classmate Lexi Del Toro each recorded a steal.
“We learned how to play more as a team,” Price said. “When we were playing well we were looking out for each other. It’s hard to be a top seeded team and play individually. This trip we learned more team offense and team defense and how to really work for each other and not against each other.”
Although the Crimson’s effort came up short during both games, the team is not disappointed, as facing tough west coast competition will prepare them well for the upcoming conference season against fellow east coast competitors.
“The trip is a great opportunity to grow as a team,” Minnis said. “We really focus on using this as a training trip to get better before we face our conference because those are the games that count for us so I think the fact that we had a lot of time in the pool playing a lot of water polo was a good thing for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of an impressive defeat of No. 23 Louisiana State at the Purple and Gold Challenge, the Harvard women’s softball team (11-11) traveled to San Diego to take part in the San Diego Classic II tournament held Mar. 15-17. Though the Crimson went a disappointing 2-3 on the trip, the team used the early losses as teaching points to help spark its previously dormant offense, picking up a pair of wins as Harvard prepared for the second half of its west coast swing and the start of its Ivy League play.
SAN DIEGO STATE 3, HARVARD 0 
 
In its final game at San Diego State (24-9), Harvard got a second look at the home team after suffering a 10-6 loss two days prior. By the fifth inning, Harvard had gone 17 straight innings without allowing a run in the tournament.
The Crimson defense then cracked, as freshman pitcher Taylor Cabe allowed two earned runs. The freshman received little support from the bats, as Harvard’s offense was stymied on the afternoon. Despite only allowing four hits, Cabe suffered the loss and dropped to 2-4 on the season.
While Katherine Lantz and Catherine Callaway each recorded two hits, the rest of the Crimson’s offense struggled. Despite having scored 24 runs in the past three games, Harvard couldn’t cross home plate.
The Crimson managed only six hits in the game, and two homeruns from SDSU proved to be the difference on the day.
HARVARD 6, TEXAS-TECH 0
In its second-to-last game of the tournament, Harvard drew Texas Tech (27-9), its opponent from the 2012 NCAA Regional Tournament in Seattle.
Though the Red Raiders had already played twice as many games as the Crimson this year, Harvard still managed to come together and find some team chemistry in San Diego. With a Texas Tech team hungry for revenge, the Crimson delivered a convincing performance and a repeat of the result from two years ago.
“We were coming off of two losses the day before…and we have a history with Texas Tech,” pitcher Laura Ricciardone said. “It’s always competitive when we play them, so the team was really excited to have a very competitive opponent.”
On no days rest, Ricciardone returned to the circle and continued her dominance from the mound. The junior posted the complete-game shutout to improve to 4-3 on the year.
“Our defense was incredible and stayed on point,” Ricciardone said. “Our offense made some good adjustments, and we were firing on all cylinders.
Allowing only three hits and no walks, Ricciardone was able to compile a streak of 13 scoreless innings in less than 24 hours. After junior Adrienne Hume put Harvard on the board in the first inning with a single to center, the Crimson hung onto the narrow lead until the fifth inning.
Harvard’s offensive juggernaut then burst for five runs, thanks to RBIs from Shelbi Olson and Kasey Lange. Hume then added her second RBI of the day, and Savannah Bradley then followed suit by driving in two runs on her own.
HARVARD 12, TEXAS-ARLINGTON 1
Coming off two straight losses to open its California trip, the Harvard team looked completely different as it took the field for its second day of action. But after Ricciardone gave up a run in the first to Texas-Arlington (14-18), it seemed like it would be more of the same for the Crimson.
That one run would prove harmless, though, as Ricciardone dominated the rest of the game. Throwing a complete game, the junior allowed only four hits the rest in the remaining six frames. Ricciardone moved to 3-3 on the season, as she struck out six batters to earn the win.
From there, Harvard’s offense exploded. In the second, Lantz scored on a single by Callaway, opening the floodgates. Bradley then drove in a run on a sac fly, and Harvard marched in four runs.
The Crimson showed the promise of what its offense could be this season, as the team added eight more runs. Lantz was the star with four hits and an RBI, and Emily Gusse and Olson each drove in two runs.
SAN DIEGO STATE 10, HARVARD 6
Harvard faced off against the home squad in a quick turnaround from its opening loss. The Aztecs came out firing on all cylinders, as SDSU scored eight runs in just two innings. Ricciardone struggled in the circle, giving up six earned runs and eight hits in only 1.2 innings pitched.
Harvard chipped away at the lead, responding with two runs of its own in the second. Smart base running and heads up softball helped easy the score, as Hume and freshman Lindsey Hagberg crossed the plate.
The defense quickly tightened up for the Crimson, as they held the Aztecs scoreless for the next four innings. More small-ball in the fourth inning added four more runs for Harvard including RBIs from Lange and Callaway.
In only her second time in the circle this year, junior Gabrielle Ruiz came in and pitched well for the Crimson. The junior went 5.1 innings, striking out four and allowing only two earned runs.
Nonetheless, down just two runs heading into the seventh, SDSU managed to respond, putting Harvard away for good. The Crimson suffered its second loss of the day, as it couldn’t rally the bats one last time.
LONG BEACH STATE 6, HARVARD 5
In its, the Crimson squared off against Long Beach State (23-9). After the second inning, the scoreboard read 3-0 Harvard, as Katherine Applebee and Gusse got their bats going early.
Despite the early offensive production, Harvard quickly surrendered the lead, giving up three runs in the ensuing inning. Cabe only allowed two earned runs and nine hits in the circle, but the Crimson struggled defensively.
“Taylor Cabe coming in as a freshman has had an immediate impact,” Ricciardone said. “She’s a hard worker and a competitor.”
Cabe pitched all six innings for Harvard, doing her best to give the team a chance. Though she recorded two errors, the real problem was Harvard’s offensive woes.
The Crimson’s bats disappeared, and Harvard went scoreless for the next four frames. Down, 6-3, heading into the final inning, Lange doubled to left centerfield, advancing to third on a throw and driving in classmate Olson.
“Kasey (Lange) has been a great leader,” sophomore pitcher Morgan Groom said. “She was our leader last year and again this year. She shows it with her bat.”
On an error by the shortstop, Lantz was then able to advance Lange home for the run. Nonetheless, down only one run, Harvard failed to complete the rally.
Junior Amanda Hansen recorded the win for LBSU, as Harvard’s offense was unable to find any more production in the final frame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Harvard men’s tennis team took home the title at the Mission Valley Spring Classic, defeating Drake. This year, the Crimson again reached the final, but failed to defend its crown as the same Bulldogs got their revenge in the rematch.
The No. 28 Crimson (10-5) breezed through the first rounds of the Mission Valley Spring Classic, defeating Denver, 4-1, and blanking host San Diego, 4-0, to earn a berth in the championship.
Last year, Harvard took down No. 43 Drake (14-5) by a score of 4-2. But it was not to be this year, as the Bulldogs upset the Crimson, 4-1, on Saturday afternoon to close out the tournament.
“It’s obviously disappointing when you’re not able to go all the way after having won the championship last year,” junior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “But we played three high quality teams and competed well against them all week. We just came up a little short in the finals.”
DRAKE 4, HARVARD 1
In last season’s matchup, Harvard jumped out to a hot start by claiming two doubles matches in quick succession. In this edition, the Bulldogs returned the favor.
To open the match, freshman Sebastian Beltrame and junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder fell in a close match on the third court, 8-7(4).
Drake’s Robin Goodman and Ben Lott upset the Crimson’s top tandem of junior Denis Nguyen and co-captain Casey MacMaster—ranked sixth nationally—in an 8-5 win to hand the Bulldogs a 1-0 advantage.
In singles, No. 37 Nguyen opened up with a 6-2, 6-0 victory, but it was all downhill from there for Harvard. Beltrame and Chaudhuri each went down in straight sets to give Drake a 3-1 lead, and then the Bulldogs’ Matt Frost beat freshman Brian Yeung in three on the fourth court to end the Crimson’s hopes for a repeat.
“Drake was a very tricky opponent, and has been strong all year,” Chaudhuri said. “They came out pretty fast in doubles, and then in singles they took it to us on almost all the courts. They just played better on this given day.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO 0
Harvard’s semifinal matchup went more smoothly than the championship, as the Crimson easily downed the No. 61 Toreros (8-6) on their home courts, 4-0.
This time, it was Harvard that showcased its doubles strength. Yeung and Steinroeder took an 8-5 win on court two, and junior Christo Schultz and Beltrame followed that up with an 8-1 victory to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
In singles, freshman Andrew Ball won, 6-4, 6-0, and Chaudhuri took a 7-6(4), 6-4 victory. Beltrame dropped one set, but otherwise had no trouble closing the match out with a 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 win.
“It’s always hard to take on a team on their home court,” Chaudhuri said. “But we competed well and were able to come out on top.”
HARVARD 4, DENVER 1
On Thursday, Harvard opened the tournament with a 4-1 win over No. 73 Denver (6-8), which would lose all three of its matches in San Diego.
The Crimson got off to another hot start, with Nguyen and MacMaster clinching an easy 8-3 win. Schultz and Beltrame then won by the same score to take home the doubles point.
In singles, Beltrame fell on court two, but Harvard turned things around from there. Steinroeder won, 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-3 on the fifth court, and Ball clinched a 6-2, 6-2 win. Yeung then rebounded from an early hole to pull out the 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 victory and finish off the Pioneers.
With the spring break tournament in the rearview mirror, Harvard has just one match against the St. John’s Red Storm before diving into Ivy League play. The Crimson will be shooting for its third straight conference crown.
“We’ve had a good year so far,” Chaudhuri said. “We’ve had solid showings in every tournament, and there are just a couple things to fine-tune. Every day is an opportunity to become a better player, to understand our limitations better. If we can all make minor improvements, we’ll be very deadly in league play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing at the New York Yankees spring training complex in Tampa, Florida, the Harvard baseball team concluded its eight-day training trip with a three-game set against Army.
The Crimson started off on a high note, riding strong pitching and consistent offense to a 5-1 win. But Harvard (4-13) could not build on the momentum, as the Black Knights (14-6) earned victories in the following two contests by tight scores of 3-2 and 6-4.
ARMY 6, HARVARD 4
In the final match up of the series on Saturday, the Crimson fell into an early hole and trailed, 6-0, after four innings. Harvard would stage a rally in the top of the ninth that resulted in three runs, but it would not be enough as the team fell, 6-4.
Army struck first in the bottom of the third, when Patrick Mescher smacked a grand slam with one out to put four runs on the board. The Black Knights tacked on two more in the next inning, as a sacrifice fly and a single extended the lead to six.
Four Crimson relievers would hold the Army bats silent for the rest of the game, providing the Harvard offense with a chance to claw its way back.
After tacking on a run in the top of the seventh, the Crimson found itself trailing, 6-1, entering the ninth. Two consecutive errors from the Black Knights brought home one run, and a single from senior Carlton Bailey plated two more.
Bailey led the team with three singles, and junior Jack Colton and junior Jake McGuiggan each added two knocks of their own. Despite amassing eight hits to Army’s seven, Harvard ultimately would have to settle for the loss.
ARMY 3, HARVARD 2
After earning a win in the first game of Friday’s doubleheader, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead but could not hang on in the late innings as the Black Knights walked off with the victory.
Harvard struck first with runs in the first and third innings, but Army had tied the game by the time the bottom of the ninth rolled around. The contest would end with one out, as a leadoff single, sacrifice bunt, and another single from Army’s Mescher brought home the winning run.
Despite outhitting the Black Knights, 12-8, Harvard left 11 men on base and could not break through offensively in the later innings.
The Crimson received strong hitting performances from junior Mike Martin and senior Kyle Larrow, who contributed four and three knocks, respectively, at the top of the lineup. The duo accounted for both of Harvard’s runs, as Martin scored on a sacrifice fly from junior Brandon Kregel in the first inning.
Two frames later, a sacrifice fly from junior Ethan Ferreira brought home Larrow, who had singled to lead off the inning.
Freshman Nick Gruener made his fourth start of the year for Harvard and finished six innings, allowing one earned run on six hits. Sophomore Nick Scahill contributed six outs of scoreless relief before being replaced by classmate T.J. Laurisch in the ninth.
HARVARD 5, ARMY 1
The Crimson began the doubleheader on a strong note, as early offense and a strong pitching performance from sophomore Sean Poppen propelled Harvard to a clean, 5-1 victory.
Poppen skillfully guided the Crimson through seven innings, striking out six while allowing just one unearned run. Army could never figure out the sophomore and did not advance a runner to second base until the sixth inning.
Poppen has completed at least six innings in each of his four starts this season, and he has posted a sparkling 1.44 earned run average while holding opposing hitters to a combined .220 batting average.
The Harvard offense stormed out of the gates with three runs in the top of the first, highlighted by a double from Ferreira that plated two. The team added another run in the second when Colton smacked an RBI two-bagger of his own. A single from junior Steve Dill in the eighth stretched the Crimson’s lead to four.
Four players – Colton, Ferreira, Dill, and sophomore Mitch Klug – registered two hits on the game, and Kregel walked three times.

When I was eight years old, my parents took me to one of those living-history towns. You know, the kind of place where you watch costumed tour guides churn butter, and when you ask where the bathroom is they say something like “Well here in colonial Something-town, public toilets haven’t yet been invented—we use chamber pots!” It’s great and all until you really have to go to the bathroom.
Anyway, the big activity for eight-year-olds was collecting authentic historical eggs from an authentic historical chicken coop to make an authentic historical breakfast for an authentic historical $20 extra charge on your hotel bill. Well, when we entered the coop, instead of walking around slowly and petting the chickens like the other kids (those wimps), I ran around the room and grabbed every single egg for my basket.
My parents were horrified. They apologized to the other kids and the parents and the costumed tour guides. (I imagine that they responded, “Well here in colonial Something-town, apologies haven’t yet been invented—we use chamber pots!”)
I always felt bad about this, but since I read about Sheryl Sandberg’s “Ban Bossy” campaign, I’ve realized that I was just exhibiting the kind of domineering, pushy behavior that’s called “leadership” for boys and “bossy” or “taking all those poor kids’ eggs” for girls. Sandberg’s campaign centers around studies showing that boys encouraged exhibiting “assertive” behavior adopt leadership positions later in life, while girls taunted for the same exhibit lower self-esteem by middle school.
Therefore, I have decided to follow Sheryl Sandberg’s “Leadership Tips for Girls,” and stop apologizing for my “assertive behavior.” Instead I will “lean in,” stand tall, and generally orient my body in whatever direction it takes to become the first female president with an Olympic-level center of balance.
I can start by following Sandberg’s advice to raise my hand in class “even when you’re not sure about the answer… try not to worry about being wrong.” This will come in handy when I haven’t done the reading. I imagine section will play out something like this:
TF: So, what did everyone think of this week’s text?Me: I think that Nietzsche’s argument about… post-modernism… symbolized…. the cultural ramifications of… The Civil War!TF: Maia, this is organic chemistry.Me: But would you say that if I was a MAN?
In all seriousness, I fully support any effort to increase girls’ confidence and leadership skills. Girls certainly should feel that they have the right to speak without making qualifying statements like “I’m not sure if this is right, but…” and “Does that make sense?” It’s outrageous, as Sandberg’s site points out, that women make up only 19% of Congress and 5% of Fortune 1,000 CEOs.
But assertive behavior is kind of like egg-collecting. If you run into the coop, pushing the other kids aside, yes, you’ll grab all the eggs. Your basket will be the fullest. But you’ll also be the biggest eight-year-old jerk in colonial Something-town.
So maybe the solution isn’t to ban bossy, but to ban bossiness, for both boys and girls. Redefine leadership so that it emphasizes collaboration, and not domination, and encourage children of both genders to be confident and ambitious but not pushy and bullying. There has to be a happy medium between being afraid to raise your hand in class and not caring whose face you hit when you shove your fist in the air.
Does that make sense?

Welcome to The Veritas Project.
 People featured on this series will simply be asked to talk about something, anything, that matters to them. This blog is a combined inspiration from Humans of New York (HONY), and Harvard’s First-Year Outdoor Program (FOP).
I spent my FOP trip last August backpacking with nine other people on the Long Trail in Vermont. Two were rising juniors, leading the trip, while the other eight of us were incoming freshmen. A lot has been written about the magic of FOP, so I won’t spend all the time I could describing how real it is (or maybe I will, some other day).
There was something special about being in the woods, where the ten of us talked about ourselves so openly, in a way I never thought people who had known each other for a mere 48 hours could. In those five days, I became closer to these nine people than I did in months with other people I met, once we were all back on campus. It may have been how the ten of us went five days without showering together, or how we learned very quickly to be transparent about our bowel needs.
But I think a lot of it was the vulnerability and openness with which we talked about ourselves, whether it was sitting together around a campsite at night or chatting one-on-one as we were making our way through a trail: what moments in our past had defined us, when we had failed, what we hoped to make out of our lives and ourselves.
These conversations, which were refreshingly common on the trail, became rare gems once we arrived back on campus. And it isn’t that we no longer valued them. It’s that on a typical day, as we rush from class to lunch to extracurriculars, every minute is fleeting. We’re thinking of ten different things, and don’t make much time to take a break, and simply spend an afternoon talking with someone. Our busy schedules are exciting, and what we spend our time doing is important to us in some way or another. However, it was beautiful to see on FOP what slowing down was able to do for us, when we could just spend all our energy hiking up a trail and getting to know one another.
The Veritas Project will be a place for these open conversations. It will be like HONY in format, profiling many people, and like FOP in substance (minus the BO), communicating what is important to each of us. And the name, The Veritas Project, hopefully captures the goal of the series, as well as the fact that it will focus on the Harvard community, from students to faculty to those in the Square.
I am so grateful that our very own Dean Pfister is the first person to be a part of The Veritas Project. He loves fungi, and you will find out why tomorrow.
What matters to you? If you or anyone you know would like to be featured on The Veritas Project, please email bessie.zhang@thecrimson.com.
