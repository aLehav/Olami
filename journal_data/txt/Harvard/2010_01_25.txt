After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 14, 2005, Lawrence H. Summers, then president of Harvard University, gave an infamous speech in which he implied that the reason few women seem to excel in mathematics is genetic. Perhaps he would cite as evidence the “indisputable” fact that girls play with dolls and not chemistry sets. After all, as we write, little girls are still playing with fresh new dolls from Santa and boys are blowing up their bedrooms and the family cat.
Some physiological and psychological studies do give girls the big gold star for communication skills and boys gold stars for spatial acumen, which is correlated with mathematical ability, but the truth is not so simple.
Some argue that the genetic difference is explained by societal necessity. According to paleontological models, in prehistoric times, males were hunters who required spatial abilities when considering questions like: “How far do I have to throw my spear to kill this sumptuous dinner before me?” and “How far and how fast do I have to run back to the cave if my spear does not kill said dinner?”
Prehistoric women, who lived without the benefit of strip malls and catalogs, filled a different societal role—they were gatherers. They also spent their time gathering developing the verbal skills to win any argument.
MIT professor Nancy Hopkins ’64 walked out of Summers’ speech in disgust, but, to Summers, that should not have come as a surprise—she was just being an emotional woman.
If someone had asked, “What about Hypatia of Egypt, Sophie Germain, Ada Lovelace, Emmy Noether, Julia Robinson, Hedy Lamarr, Rosalind Franklin, Marie Curie, and Lise Meitner?” perhaps Summers would have replied that these women would not have gotten tenure at Harvard under his watch, based on discouragingly low promotion rates for women during Summers’ presidency.
“Besides, they are the exceptions that prove the rule,” Summers might have added, the rule being exemplified by Newton, Einstein, and Will Hunting.
Is the Summers of our discontent correct, that XX does not equal XY when it comes to mathematics?
There are differences between the brains of men and women. Women have lady-parts, about some of which monologues have been written, and those lady-parts, like every organ, are regulated by the brain. A true scientist must concede that some of those differences may have an impact on cognition. Those lady-parts certainly prevent teenaged boys and the occasional state governor from thinking clearly.
The problem with Summers’ theory is that he unscientifically rejects a factor that would prevent anyone from measuring his alleged genetic differences. He said that the reason you do not find many female mathematicians and scientists at top American universities has nothing to do with gender discrimination, because it does not exist. He gave a game-theoretic argument: As soon as one university recognized the talented women that others were rejecting, it would hire those women, and its competitors would eventually recognize what they are losing by discriminating and stop doing so. Of course, the United States Constitution was ratified in 1788 and the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, so this epiphany might take a while.
In fact, two studies published in 1990 and 1995 found “a slight female advantage in computation in elementary and middle school,” and, according to the 2009 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States, “Girls have now reached parity with boys in mathematics performance in the U.S.”
Still, only 31 percent of U.S. doctorates in mathematics went to women in 2007, with women making up only 12 percent of the math and statistics professors at the top 50 universities.
This may not all be a result of sexism, but it seems odd to jump immediately to the conclusion that it is biology.
“Compared with men,” a report by the National Academies says, “women faculty members are generally paid less and promoted more slowly, receive fewer honors, and hold fewer leadership positions.” The report goes on to say that “[t]hese discrepancies do not appear to be based on productivity, the significance of their work, or any other performance measures.”
So if biology is not the determinant, what about society? Mattel once made a Barbie doll that said, “Math class is tough.” The doll also said, “I’ll just have celery sticks and water, please.” “Like...like so there I was and like...what-ever.” And: “Oh. My. God.”
In our culture, it may be that math is less appealing to girls. To change this equation, actress Danica McKellar has written math textbooks with covers resembling Cosmopolitan, and Austrian artist Peren Linn has designed jeans with Fermat’s Last Theorem imprinted on them, to merge elliptic curves with feminine ones.
Want to see how bad girls aren’t at math? Watch how quickly they can figure out the marked-down price of any clothing item during a sale. This is especially impressive when the price consists not only of the number marked down on the tag, but also of another percentage listed on a big sign inviting shoppers to “Take an Extra 20, 30, 40 Percent Off!”
Or maybe that’s just one of those gathering skills yet to be explained.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We are living in difficult financial times. Open up your average newspaper and stories of layoffs, stocks rising and falling, and the Federal Reserve’s latest attempts to rescue the economy abound. Most Americans are antsy. A lack of financial literacy has only exacerbated this mood. Until the federal government takes an active role in the basic economic education of its constituents, things will not get any easier. From Warren Buffet to Joe the Plumber, the economic vitality of the United   States is a source of concern whether one seeks to prosper or to secure a leisurely retirement.
While the news media disseminates a ton of financial information with the intention of informing the public, the barrage of numbers, pompous words, and economic jargon (no-load index funds, moderate growth fund, treasury-inflation protected securities) often tunes the average American out. While many Harvard students read the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times on occasion, some religiously, not everyone is the average Harvard student.
Financial literacy is important in today’s world. Without a balanced understanding of how to save, invest, and spend one’s money, one can develop dangerous habits in all of these three areas that can have disastrous ramifications. People spend, save, and invest on a daily basis, and, without a proper understanding of how to handle one’s personal finances or how the financial markets work, the American economy and its participating members are left without a buoy.
In order to reengage the American public, the Obama administration needs to devise a line of communication to verbalize how the performance of the economy is directly affecting their lives. Some call it “kitchen table economics” or “economics light.” The constant bombardment of dreary economic news loaded with obscure facts, numbers, and forecasts leaves the average American unable to digest what can be useful information.
One improvement would be for the administration to publish weekly documents that help us understand how our pockets are affected by the latest tides sweeping the markets. An up-to-date depository and a glossary of simple financial terms for the average person would do wonders for financial literacy and financial responsibility in an age where the urge for rampant spending so often overcomes common sense.
The financial crisis that struck the world this past November reminded all Americans just how important literacy of the financial markets and sound business practices are to economic vitality. President Barack Obama and the leading economists at the world’s biggest bank proclaimed that this was the most severe economic shock since the Great Depression. Articles were written, memos were circulated, and legislation was signed, but all to no avail.
It is a bonanza on Wall Street. One of the Obama administration’s purported goals was to help Main Street. The stimulus package, health care reform, and tax credits were all ways in which it was and is trying to achieve this goal. But when John Smith opens up the newspaper, he reads about “Bonus Day” on Wall Street. There is very little about how President Obama is directly working to inform the public of his plans to salvage a deepening recession and how the financial markets are affecting their daily lives.
Issues such as retirement, social security, and health care premiums have been eclipsed by economic jargon spewed out from economists who are reputed to say things that are 100 percent accurate but 100 percent irrelevant. Ask an economist for his address and you will receive his latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, which are perfectly correct but useless to those without a compass or navigation system.
The government should resolve to educate the American public about the fundamental idea of economics: the idea of having unlimited wants but scarce resources. To be fair, the government established a Financial Literacy and Education Commission in 2003 and the treasury established its Office of Financial Education in 2002. But most Americans have not heard of these commissions because of a lack of publicity. With a little more accessible financial knowledge and understanding of how things such as interest rates can affect one’s pocketbook, Americans will make smarter decisions, invest more money into the economy, and participate to a greater degree in the dialogue that dominates our newspapers and our thoughts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Helen Molesworth of the Harvard Art Museum will take over as chief curator at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, ICA officials announced earlier this month.
Molesworth, who has headed the modern and contemporary art department at Harvard since 2007, was chosen from a pool of 50 candidates to replace ICA’s Nicholas Baume, effective Feb. 22.
After it became clear that Harvard’s plans to build a new contemporary art museum in Allston would not move forward for several years, Molesworth decided to apply for the ICA position, she said in an interview with the Boston Globe on Jan. 13.
“I had been hired to help Harvard build a new museum across the river,” Molesworth told the Globe. But she said that one day she thought, “The ICA is that building. I should probably call.”
Molesworth could not be reached for comment yesterday.
“She will be missed, but our commitment to modern and contemporary art is unwavering and continues across several curatorial departments here at the Art Museum,” the museum’s director Thomas W. Lentz wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Lentz added that the Art Museum will begin a search for Molesworth’s replacement soon but did not specify a time frame.
As Harvard’s first curator of contemporary art since the museum established a department dedicated to contemporary art in 1997, Molesworth organized a number of noteworthy exhibitions, including this fall’s “ACT UP, New York: Activism, Art, and the AIDS Crisis, 1987-1993.”
“Helen is a curatorial force and will elevate the ICA to a new level of leadership,” Jill Medvedow, director of the ICA, said in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen L. Burt, an associate professor of English, was named a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism on Saturday.
“Close Calls with Nonsense: Reading New Poetry,” the book for which Burt was nominated, is a collection of critical essays on both modern and contemporary poetry from the last 30 years.
Burt, whose course offerings for the spring semester include an English seminar on 21st century American poetry, said that his interest in contemporary poetry is two-fold.
“First, I like to see the way poets respond to the way we’re living now,” he said. “Second, I like introducing poets who move me and stay with me to other readers.”
“I like trying to convince people that my favorite poets are worthy of sustained attention,” Burt added.
While Burt said he admires traditional poets, such as Keats, who have adorned the syllabi of English classes for years, he noted a distinction between writing about classic and contemporary poetry.
“Keats doesn’t need me to tell you that Keats is worth reading,” Burt said. “Writing about some of the living poets I’ve written about might help the poetry of the present survive into the realm of the future.”
Although several of the pieces included in “Close Calls with Nonsense” had previously appeared in various publications such as The London Review of Books, Burt said that he began to speak with publishers about compiling them into a book in 2005.
The book, which was published last year, includes essays on the work of several of Burt’s favorite contemporary poets, such as Rae Armantrout and Laura Kasischke.
The National Book Critics Circle, an organization that includes around 600 book reviewers, was founded in 1974 and has been giving annual awards ever since to highlight the best books and reviews written in the English language.
This year’s winners will be announced at New York City’s New School on March 11.

When it was founded in October, the Student Alliance for Global Health at Harvard was a unique kind of organization—one of few that aimed to bring together student groups from different schools across the University.
“The idea of the SAGHAH network is to link global health groups and campaigns across Harvard and to provide them with a common platform to collaborate, but to otherwise support individual groups in what they do best,” said Cecil M. Haverkamp, a staff member of the School of Public Health and member of the SAGHAH board.
At the time it was formed, SAGHAH’s members could not predict that four months later, the organization—which now consists of representatives from 10 schools—would be given the opportunity to put its connections to work. SAGHAH is now in the midst of coordinating student groups on both sides of the river in a collective effort to help a country in need.
“Haiti is really on top of many students’ minds, especially those interested in global health and social justice issues,” Haverkamp said, explaining why SAGHAH is part of the “Harvard for Haiti” campaign. Whereas faculty-based organizations such as Partners In Health and Harvard Humanitarian Initiative have the resources to provide on-site medical aid, student groups in SAGHAH are seeking to develop feasible response efforts on campus.
SAGHAH’s short-term goal is to raise as much money as possible, while the long-term goal is to cement Harvard’s commitment to Haiti so that other organizations, such as PIH and HHI, can focus on their on-site response.
While SAGHAH has been instrumental in bringing student groups together, the organization also recognizes the responsibility of individuals.
“We are very supportive of [the efforts of] individuals—individual students or student organizations,” said Hummy Song ’08, a student at the Kennedy School and co-founder of SAGHAH. “We see it as our role to encourage and support these kinds of activities, in addition to helping coordinate university-wide efforts.”
Organizations within SAGHAH are already planning an upcoming joint initiative. The Harvard College Global Health Review and the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition will be holding a “dough-raiser” at Uno Chicago Grill this Friday evening, according to the Review’s Co-Editor-In-Chief, Michael T. Henderson ’11. Uno’s customers who present a coupon that will be handed out during this week will have 20 percent of their purchase donated to the “Harvard for Haiti” relief effort.
“Haiti is always talked about in global health, so we’ve heard a lot about Haiti,” Henderson said. “It’s just the realization that our actions now, even if small, really do have the chance to save lives.”
Song and Haverkamp also emphasized the need for the public to understand that aid requires a long-term investment.
“I know there are efforts to try to establish various ways to raise awareness beyond just the immediate aftermath—to keep awareness levels high in the weeks and months to come,” Song said.
One of the coordinated endeavors aimed at longevity is an upcoming benefit concert to be held on Feb. 12 in Sanders Theatre.
Song explained that prior to communicating through SAGHAH, both the Cambridge campus and the Longwood campus had organizations that were planning to hold the similar concerts on either side of the river at the same time.
“[We thought], why don’t we bring together the entirety of the Harvard campus instead?” Song said. She stressed that though it was acceptable for both these campuses to do the same thing, it was also important that they were aware of what others were doing in order to combine their efforts.

The Honorable Lucy H. Koh ’90 was nominated by President Barack Obama last Wednesday to serve on the State District Court for the Northern District of California. If Koh, who is also a 1993 graduate of Harvard Law School, is confirmed by the Senate, she will become the nation’s first Korean-American federal district court judge.
“This is a terrific appointment and we at the Law School are proud of her,” said HLS Dean Martha Minow, who taught Koh in a civic procedure class during Koh’s time at the Law School.
Minow described Koh as a “fine law student” who exhibited “talent and accomplishment” even in her early twenties.
“She will be a great judge,” Minow said.
After Law School, Koh amassed considerable legal experience in the public and private sectors.
Prior to her 2008 nomination to a judgeship in the Santa Clara County Superior Court, Koh began her career at the Department of Justice and then moved to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles to prosecute violent crime and fraud cases. She later worked as an intellectual property litigator in Silicon Valley with the firm McDermott, Will & Emery.
Bijal V. Vakil, Koh’s former coworker and the Regional Governor for the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, said that placing Koh on the federal bench would send a positive message to the Asian-American community in Northern California.
“In the San Francisco Bay Area, we don’t have a single Asian-American district court judge [though] the is over 35 percent Asian,” Vakil said. “It’s kind of shocking.”
Second year HLS student Jennifer A. Lee, who serves as conference co-chair for the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association at HLS, said she believes Koh’s nomination is an important symbolic step.
“Asian-Americans and, I think, all students of color still face a degree of uncertainty. There is definitely concern about how their ethnicity will impact their success,” Lee said. “For law students, we have a greater degree of faith in our ability to succeed when we see these ground-breaking types of appointments.”
Koh is married to Stanford Law Professor Mariano-Florentino Cuellar ’93, and the couple have two children.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team of Harvard Medical School and teaching hospital affiliates, led by Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter Jr., traveled to Haiti in a relief mission last week.
The team spent five days in Haiti after the country was devastated by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on Jan. 12.
Prior to the trip, Counter collected 76 boxes of medicine donated by several benefactors, including Harvard University Health Services.
According to UHS Director David S. Rosenthal ’59, the UHS pharmacy was able to collect a large amount of medicine that would have been otherwise outdated in three or four weeks.
“We were able to donate a significant box of medicine, in addition to medicinal supplies like crutches and bandages,” Rosenthal said.
Counter had previously assisted with relief efforts following an earthquake in Ecuador, an experience which he said was crucial in determining what supplies to bring on his relief mission to Haiti.
Drawing on his work in Ecuador, Counter brought to Haiti 100 family-sized tents, which he and actress Debbie Allen donated.
“I’ve been in this kind of  disaster before,” Counter said. “A number of people die, but more are injured and in need in of not only medical help, but also shelter.”
The Haitian Embassy had also requested that Counter’s group bring 100 body bags, in addition to medical supplies and tents. All the supplies were shipped down to the Dominican Republic for free by Jet Blue.
Ultimately, Counter’s team was able to provide shelter to around 500 people, as well as medical attention to a similar number of individuals.
Counter attributed the efficiency of his relief trip to his collaboration with Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernández Reyna.
Fernández, who is friends with Counter, provided the relief team with two helicopters, allowing Counter’s group to fly directly into Port-au-Prince, Counter said.
“We were able to bypass problems with transportation other relief workers are facing,” Counter said. “We flew over airports that had supplies just sitting there due to transportation issues.”
Counter said that he plans to return to Haiti in the near future with one thousand body bags and one hundred tents, all donated by actor Will Smith.
“Tragedy seems to bring humanity together,” he said. “In Haiti, people from all over the world were reaching out to help human beings in need, and this brought tears to my eyes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 60 Cambridge residents met for the second session of the Climate Emergency Congress on Saturday to vote on a list of recommendations responding to the city’s climate challenges. Four hours and 52 minutes later, the delegates came to the consensus to reconvene for a third session.
The community members originally hoped to pass two proposals that had been prepared by a 13-member committee following the Dec. 12 session—the first recent city-wide discussion on how residents and local businesses can adopt more environmentally friendly practices.
The attendees, who received drafts of the proposals the day before, voiced concerns about what they characterized as a rushed process and quibbled over details throughout the meeting. A third session, they argued, would allow time for revisions and closer scrutiny of the document.
Once the group decided to postpone finalizing recommendations that they plan to later send to the City Council, the delegates decided to hold unofficial votes on the proposals.
The first proposal focused on broader tasks, such as tracking the city’s annual progress and ensuring that changes meet community needs. The proposal was generally met with acceptance, with 47 delegates voting in support and 12 opposed.
The second proposal contained a more specific list of actions, including the creation of a Climate Emergency Response Board to coordinate city action and change Cambridge’s green infrastructure. After some modification, the measure also met widespread approval, with 40 votes in favor and 11 opposed.
Earlier in the day, the delegates split up into small groups to hone in on key recommendations from the December session. The delegates were then divided into action-specific groups­—focusing on areas such as energy waste, solar power, forestry, and accounting methods—to brainstorm further steps Cambridge residents could take.
City Council member Henrietta J. Davis summarized the city’s environmental goals for the future as a three-tiered process, starting with citywide advocacy, community group work, and individual responsibility.
Davis also reminded the delegates of the financial constraints that may limit extensive environmental projects.
“It’s not a great time of huge new money to do things,” Davis said, listing the $3.9 million shortfall in the school budget as an example. “It doesn’t mean you can’t reallocate, but money isn’t growing on trees right now.”
In her closing words, former Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons concluded that more important to effecting a change quickly was the power of working together.
“The Congress has also demonstrated that there are important things we can do working together as a city-wide community at all levels,” Simmons said. “This is a lesson I hope we can take from the Congress—that it’s not just going to take one of us, it takes all of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—In the Ivy League season, nothing is guaranteed—especially the second time around. Despite having dominated Dartmouth just two weeks ago back home, the Harvard men’s basketball team found itself struggling to repeat that performance Saturday night at Leede Arena in front of 1,555 fans.
Coming off a nail-biting win over St. Francis, the Big Green was looking to avenge a 74-57 drubbing at the hands of the Crimson—which hadn’t played a game since the squads’ last matchup.
Add in a cold shooting night for Harvard, and the time seemed right for Dartmouth to take advantage.
But Crimson freshman Kyle Casey scored 19 points to go along with 10 rebounds, and co-captain Jeremy Lin chipped in 19 points and six assists to help Harvard (13-3, 2-0 Ivy) slip by Dartmouth, 62-58.
The Big Green (4-12, 0-2) was led by guard Ronnie Dixon’s season-high 15 points.
Dartmouth basketball has found itself in the headlines recently due to a head-coaching change, as well as the drug-related arrest of a player last week, but the squad was anything but distracted in its league home opener.
The Big Green’s energetic play surprised the Crimson with a 13-0 spurt in the game’s early going.
“They play with a lot of heart, considering the stuff that’s been going on with their team,” sophomore center Keith Wright said.
While Dartmouth played well, Harvard’s field goal attempts—whether they were wide-open threes or lay-ins up close—simply weren’t falling.
“Usually a lot of the shots that we were taking go in,” Casey said. “Our shots were in rhythm for the most part...shots weren’t falling today, so [we’ve] just got to go back and fine-tune some things.”
After missing all but one of its first 10 shots, Harvard settled down and slowly clawed its way back, tying the game at 22 when freshman guard Brandyn Curry whipped a quick pass to Wright for an easy lay-in.
The Crimson would close out the half’s remaining 3:30 on a mini-run, and Casey’s buzzer-beating three-pointer sent his team into the locker room with a 31-27 lead.
“I was really complimentary of our guys for getting us back in the game in the first half,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we made a tremendous effort to make it close.”
Dartmouth responded with increased defensive intensity in the second frame. Capitalizing on the game’s slower pace—each team only picked up four fast-break points—the Big Green took a one-point advantage with 15:12 to play on a three-point play by guard Robby Pride.
But the lead would be short-lived.
When his team fell behind, Lin stepped up. Finding little success from long range, the star guard drove to the basket and drew opportunities at the foul line.
His playmaking ability helped to spark a 15-1 Harvard run, which helped extend the team’s lead to 13 with just under seven minutes to play.
But the Crimson could not put the game out of reach, as missed free throws down the stretch would allow Dartmouth the chance to attempt a comeback.
As a team, Harvard shot only 39 percent from the field, and the situation was no better at the free throw line, where the Crimson shot an uncharacteristically poor 14-of-26.
Freshmen Christian Webster and Dee Giger continued to have difficulty finding their strokes.  The guards missed all eight of their combined three-point attempts, and Webster made only two of his 12 tries from the floor.
“They’re freshmen, and I think sometimes they need to see the ball go in the basket before they can get a little more confidence,” Amaker said of his rookies’ first conference road game. “Sometimes being away from home, it’s a much tougher situation than they would probably expect.”
With its shooters having an off night, the Crimson turned to its big men for baskets—primarily Casey and Wright, who finished with 13 points (6-of-9 from the field) and eight rebounds.
Fellow post player and co-captain Doug Miller had a strong workmanlike performance, picking up seven boards—including five offensive rebounds—in only 15 minutes.
A scary moment came early in the second half, when forward Pat Magnarelli leapt for an offensive rebound and fell hard to the floor. The senior had to be helped off the court by two teammates.
Following the game, Magnarelli called the injury a high ankle sprain and said he would receive an X-ray yesterday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—Despite entering Hanover as the 15-point favorite, the Harvard men’s basketball team struggled to defeat a Dartmouth team predicted to finish in the cellar of the Ivy League.
The Crimson has traditionally run into trouble against its travel partner on the road, falling to the Big Green in four of its previous six trips north of the border.
Last season, Harvard arrived at Dartmouth riding a wave of high expectations following its upset of then-No. 17 Boston College. But despite the Crimson’s momentum, it took a last-second shot from then-freshman Oliver McNally to secure the one-point victory.
Sophomore Keith Wright, who has been a part of the two close victories, is unable to explain his team’s poor performances in New Hampshire.
“I can’t even tell you,” Wright said. “Maybe it’s the rims.”
Harvard’s highly-touted freshman class struggled in its first conference road game, shooting a combined 1-of-10 from deep and turning the ball over six times.
“It was a really intense atmosphere,” freshman Kyle Casey said. “I wasn’t expecting that, to be honest—definitely a learning experience for all of us freshmen.”
The Crimson will have to quickly get over its road woes if it hopes to compete for the Ivy League title. Harvard will embark on its toughest road trip of the season next weekend when the team travels to New York City and Ithaca on back-to-back nights to take on Columbia and Cornell.
CASEY TIME
Casey arrived at Lavietes Pavilion this fall surrounded by high expectations—he was picked by numerous media outlets to haul in Ivy Rookie of the Year honors—and a tremendous amount of hype.
And so far this season, Casey has lived up to that hype.
Two games after scoring a career-high 27 points against Santa Clara, Casey notched 19 points and 10 rebounds Saturday, recording the first double-double of the season by any Harvard player.
“[I was] just doing what I could to help my team win,” Casey said. “I just happened to get the double-double tonight—could have been anybody.”
Casey not only turned in an efficient performance—he shot 6-of-7 from the field—but also demonstrated his offensive versatility.
The Brimmer and May graduate knocked down three outside jumpers, soared through the air to catch and dunk an alley-oop, and secured a number of crucial defensive rebounds.
“I thought Kyle played incredibly well for us,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “Kyle has just been coming on, as we’ve seen for a while now, with how well he’s been able to play and knock down shots and get big defensive rebounds.”
While Casey contributed throughout his 30 minutes of play, his biggest shot came with time expiring in the first half and the Crimson up by a single point.
Co-captain Jeremy Lin controlled the ball at the top of the key as the seconds ticked off the clock and then made a move toward the basket. When the defense shifted its focus to Lin, the playmaker skipped a pass to Casey, who was set up for the three along the left wing.
As the buzzer sounded, Casey’s shot sailed through the net, giving Harvard a four-point lead heading into the break.
Casey showed off his athleticism in the second half, thundering home an alley-oop thrown from sophomore point guard Oliver McNally.
“I didn’t think Oliver was going to throw it,” Casey said. “He just zipped it in there so I jumped. I was pretty pumped afterward.”
FINISHING PROBLEMS
Sporting a 10-point lead with just 1:21 remaining, the Crimson appeared ready to start warming up the bus back to Cambridge.
But two Dartmouth three-pointers and four Harvard missed free throws allowed the Big Green to make the finish too close for comfort for the Crimson.
Dartmouth’s Ronnie Dixon got things started for the home team, knocking down a three-pointer to cut Harvard’s lead to seven. The Crimson’s free-throw woes kept them from putting the game away.
Wright and McNally each went 1-of-2 from the stripe in the final minute, while Lin went 2-of-4 and the Crimson escaped with just the four-point victory.
Harvard’s shooting woes down the stretch underscored a poor shooting performance throughout the night. The Crimson shot 14-of-26 from the stripe—53.8 percent—and 2-of-17 from deep.
“It was a really tough shooting day for us from an offensive standpoint,” Amaker said. “I don’t know what you’d call it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much has been asked of the veterans of the women’s basketball team (9-6, 0-1 Ivy) this season, but on Thursday night it was a pair of freshmen who stepped up in Harvard’s 96-52 loss to No. 15/16 Florida State (17-3, 3-1 ACC) at Tucker Civic Center.
“They were number six in the country for a while—they’re a talented team,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “You don’t ever understand that level until you’ve played in it.”
The Seminoles weren’t quite as dominant as expected early, as Harvard was able to keep the game close for eight minutes.
Sophomore Caitlin Rowland hit two free throws to bring the game within four, but Florida State’s Alysha Harvin netted a jumper with 11:56 remaining in the half, putting the Crimson back in a hole.
From that point, Harvard struggled to keep pace, as it could not cover up the absence of junior co-captain Claire Wheeler in the post.
“Claire, who’s our starting center, hasn’t played in two games,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a big part of what we do, especially against [a team like Florida State]. We don’t match up one-on-one with that kind of front court, so we did it as a team, which left the perimeter open and they hit some threes.”
The nationally ranked Seminoles never looked back after Harvin’s jumper, putting the Crimson at a 16-point deficit by halftime, one from which the team would be unable to recover.
The second half was even worse for Harvard, as Florida State scored 52 points, doubling up the Crimson’s 28 in the frame.
“Overall, they’re just a better team,” junior co-captain Christine Matera said. “We were just outmatched and outplayed.”
None of Harvard’s starters scored in double digits, with Matera coming the closest in a nine-point effort.
But amidst the slaughter were breakthrough efforts by Crimson freshmen Elle Hagedorn and Miriam Rutzen, who led the team in scoring and rebounding, respectively.
Both have been gaining momentum with increased playing time over the course of the season, but neither has cracked into the starting lineup.
“Miriam and Elle have gotten better and better and better,” Delaney-Smith said. “They didn’t back down.”
Hagedorn got on the board before 11 minutes had expired in the first half, but the majority of her points came later as she scored a three-point shot to close out the half and accounted for six of Harvard’s 28 points in the second half, totaling 11 for the contest.
Rutzen also raised her game in the second half, finding four of her six rebounds after intermission.
“[Rutzen] spends so much extra time working on her game that there’s no doubt that she’ll be one of the greats,” Delaney-Smith said. “I’m trying to [make rebounding an asset]. Miriam is the kind of player who hears the call.”
The game marked a stark contrast to the Crimson’s Ivy opener, in which Hagedorn and Rutzen combined for four points and four rebounds. On Thursday in Tallahassee, Hagedorn filled out her stat line with three rebounds, two assists, and a steal, while Rutzen bolstered her six rebounds with two points and three steals—the most of any player on the night.
The efforts of the pair were far from enough to keep the game competitive, as five Seminoles scored in double figures with red-shirt freshman Chasity Clayton carrying the day with 17 points. But the continued emergence of relatively anonymous freshmen would provide a boost in conference play as stars Emma Markley and Brogan Berry have both earned targets on their backs throughout the Ivy League.
“[Rutzen and Hagedorn] are going to be big parts of our future success,” Matera said. “If we’re going to win the Ivy title, our freshmen are going to be a big part of that.”
Meanwhile, Harvard showed that it still has a ways to go before it can compete with top contenders such as Florida State. But the challenge provided an opportunity for the Crimson to recover from its heartbreaking loss to Dartmouth before launching into more Ivy play.
“We obviously had nothing to lose,” Matera said. “They’re the ranked team. It was a great experience. Unfortunately, we didn’t have our best showing.”
While the blowout loss provided little respite, it allowed Harvard to discover two new weapons, both of whom could prove important in future Ivy battles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some hockey games are dramatic, hinging on key penalties and last-minute heroics. For the Harvard women’s hockey team, Friday night’s win was not one of those games—but the Crimson’s not complaining.
No. 6 Harvard (10-4-4, 8-4-2 ECAC) dominated from whistle to whistle, blanking conference bottom-dweller Union (5-19-1, 1-11-1), 4-0, at Bright Hockey Center.
“We used a lot of people, we got better as the game went on,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “Our puck protection was real good, our transition game was excellent today, and I’m pleased with how we played.”
Junior Liza Ryabkina scored a pair of goals and freshman Laura Bellamy—starting in place of injured senior Christina Kessler—made 13 saves for her first career shutout.
“It’s [Bellamy’s] first win, so everybody was extremely excited for her,” Ryabkina said. “It was really important for us as a team.”
Harvard outshot the Dutchwomen, 53-13, for the game, while accumulating just two penalties to Union’s seven.
One of those Dutchwoman penalties set the stage for the Crimson’s first goal.
Union’s Kayleigh Melia went to the box for hitting after the whistle with just under five minutes to play in the first period, and Harvard didn’t take long to capitalize.
Co-captain Cori Bassett fed the puck to freshman Jillian Dempsey, who in turn crossed it to junior Leanna Coskren left of the goal. Coskren’s one-timer hit the back of the net just 17 seconds into the power play.
Through its seven power plays on the night, Harvard racked up 15 shots.
“We changed up our power play a week ago, and I think we’re getting some pretty good chemistry going,” Stone said. “We’re getting good looks at the net, and that’s the key to any power play—finding kids [in] underneath seams…We’ve got to bury a few more, but we will.”
Though the Crimson would have plenty of power-play chances through the game, it failed to score again with the man advantage—including through 49 seconds of 5-on-3 play in the second period.
“We could have scored more,” Ryabkina admitted.
In fact, the Dutchwomen’s best scoring chance of the night came with Harvard on the power play. Though Union’s Lauren Hoffman was whistled for bodychecking, an icing call on the Crimson set up a faceoff in its defensive zone.
The Dutchwomen won the faceoff and ripped off a quick shot that hit the left pipe and skirted wide.
The Crimson netted its second goal at even strength at 14:40 of the second. Senior Anna McDonald, who led the team with seven shots on the night, won the puck on the boards and passed it back to Ryabkina, who was crashing the net.
Ryabkina lit the lamp to make the score 2-0.
Harvard came back from the second intermission to play its best hockey of the game, generating 18 shots in the final frame and creating opportunity after opportunity.
Midway through the period, the Crimson notched its first shorthanded goal of the season. Though junior Katharine Chute was in the box for tripping, her linemates were entirely unfazed.
Having pushed Union back into its defensive zone, junior Kate Buesser intercepted a pass and found Dempsey in the slot for the easy goal and the 3-0 lead.
The Dutchwomen came close again as their power play expired, firing a shot that just grazed the crossbar, but Harvard added a fourth goal three minutes later.
Fresh off the bench, Ryabkina picked up a loose puck and fired an unassisted top-shelf shot that Union goaltender Alana Marcinko barely saw coming.
“It was me and Anna McDonald, and I called for the puck,” Ryabkina explained. “I knew where the net was, so I just shot it through the screen and it went in high glove.”
Bellamy made three saves in the final frame to preserve her shutout and earn her first win in three starts.
But on an evening of total Crimson dominance, Ryabkina was quick to point out that the victory belonged to the entire squad.
“All of it was the team plays,” she said. “That’s how we win games, and that’s how we want to continue winning games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s hockey team saw Rensselaer on the ice, the Engineers were celebrating the overtime victory that sent them to their first-ever ECAC championship game.
Back then, the Crimson was stunned as its season ended unexpectedly. But when Rennselaer picked up its second-ever win at Bright Hockey Center on Saturday, Harvard wasn’t quite as surprised.
The Engineers (10-10-5, 7-4-3 ECAC) scored two early goals and never looked back, handing the No. 6 Crimson (10-5-4, 8-5-2) a 4-2 defeat.
“[It’s] very disappointing,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I was really hoping that our kids were going to come out with a lot of urgency and fire, and we were flat early on and played catch-up all game.”
Rensselaer controlled the first 10 minutes of play, getting on the scoreboard less than two minutes after the opening whistle.
From a scrum in front of the net, Engineer Laura Guillemette picked up an Allysen Weidner rebound and buried it for her first collegiate goal.
Rensselaer’s Laura Gersten was credited with the secondary assist, the first of her three points on the afternoon.
The Crimson took two consecutive penalties in the opening minutes, and at 8:06, Rensselaer broke through again.
Gersten, high in the offensive zone, took a pass from Allison Wright and beat Harvard rookie netminder Laura Bellamy for the 2-0 lead.
The Engineers had 10 shots on goal before junior Kate Buesser got the puck on net nine minutes into the game.
“We were back on our heels, and we’re not that kind of team,” Stone said. “We’ve got to get on our toes and get after it and stay aggressive.”
Harvard came back in the second half of the period, ripping 12 shots before the first intermission. And with just over a minute to play in the opening frame, co-captain Cori Bassett cut the deficit in half.
Fresh off the bench, Bassett scooped up a loose puck and let a slapshot fly from just inside the blue line that sizzled over Engineer netminder Shannon Ramelot.
“That’s a big goal,” Buesser said. “As a defensive team, you never want to give up a goal like that, and it gives us a lot of momentum going into the second period.”
The Crimson picked up its play in the second frame, outshooting Rensselaer, 20-8. Harvard’s defense also came together, tightening up after its early-game lapses with a number of blocked shots—the most impressive from Bassett, who dove across the crease to redirect a puck away from the net.
“We play very good defense, but that doesn’t mean we want to play defense,” Stone said.
But for all of the Crimson’s shots in the second, it was the Engineers who came away with a goal.
Seven minutes into the period, a trio of Rensselaer players broke towards the goal, catching co-captain Kathryn Farni in an odd-man rush.
Gersten wound up with the puck on her stick and placed it in the top right corner of the net for the 3-1 lead.
But Harvard hung tough, picking up its offensive game in the third to create its best scoring chances of the contest.
The Crimson’s top line had plenty of looks at the net, including one from junior Katharine Chute mid-period that required a beauty of a glove save from Ramelot. And with 3:40 left in the game, the line’s chemistry finally translated into results.
Dempsey brought the puck up the left side of the ice and unleashed a shot. Ramelot made the initial save, but Buesser was there to slam home the rebound.
“Dempsey, I think she had like four people on her and was able to finagle her way out of there,” Buesser said. “Every player knows that if you shoot for the far pad it will pretty much go right out to the middle, and it rebounded right to me.”
With the score 3-2, Stone pulled Bellamy with just under a minute to play. But Harvard couldn’t net the equalizer, and with 30 ticks left on the clock, Engineer Alisa Harrison scored an empty-netter to secure the win for Rensselaer.
Bellamy made nine saves in the third on her way to a career-best 25-save performance. She will get plenty of chances to top that mark, though, as senior Christina Kessler’s season is over due to injury.
“I’m sure she’d like a couple back, but [Bellamy] did a real good job in the third period keeping us in the game,” Stone said. “She’s got to grow up fast, and she needs to take advantage of this opportunity. You’ve got to look at it as an opportunity, you can’t look at it as a bummer.”
But with just seven league games remaining, the Crimson will need to play better from top to bottom to maintain its third-place conference seat.
“I don’t think we played how we wanted to play by any stretch of the imagination,” Buesser said. “We’ve got to get back to practice and start playing the way we know how to play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As it raced in its second carnival in as many weekends, the Harvard skiing team gained momentum for the upcoming season.
With six top-40 finishers between the four Crimson teams and an impressive fifth-place finish in the women’s nordic relay, Harvard offered a strong showing at the St. Michael’s College Winter Carnival.
The women’s nordic team was led by captain Audrey Mangan, who placed a team-high 24th in Friday’s 10k individual race.
“Historically that’s a pretty good result for us as a team,” nordic coach Chris City said about Mangan’s finish. “Anything in the top 30 is an encouraging result.”
Other top finishers for the women’s nordic squad were freshman Esther Kennedy and junior Cara Sprague—who is also a Crimson cross-country runner—as the two finished 34th and 39th, respectively.
These three Harvard competitors also had a notable finish in the 3-by-3 women’s sprint relay, placing fifth in a pool of nearly 30 teams.
“It was the highest finish this team has ever had,” City said. “We beat a lot of teams that we typically finish behind. It was a really solid result.”
The men’s nordic performance was not as consistent as the women’s due to critical mistakes during the races.
“The guys’ side skied okay,” City said. “Each of our guys made a few mistakes on the course, and unfortunately a few mistakes can really add up.”
The men’s relay team, composed of freshmen Anthony Ryerson and Kevin Sprague and captain Trevor Petach, posted an 18th-place finish.
Like the women’s nordic team, the women’s alpine had several Crimson athletes finish in top spots.
Heading the alpine team was freshman Catherine Sheils, who finished 21st in the individual race on Friday and 17th in the race on Saturday. Also placing in the top 40 were freshman Megan Luck and Tenley Malmquist, who finished 27th and 39th for Harvard.
“This weekend has brought one of the better women’s results we’ve had in a long time,” said alpine assistant coach Erik Kankainen. “We’re certainly happy with the direction we’re going.”
Also akin to their brother team, the men’s alpine squad had a little more trouble finding success on the course.
“It was a tough hill and there was a pretty high rate of [competitors] who weren’t able to finish the course,” Kankainen said. “A few of our guys weren’t able to make it down cleanly.”
Still, despite the difficulty it may have had, the Crimson was able to post two top-40 finishers with one not far behind.
Captain Christopher Kinner placed 35th and junior Sam Harrison and freshman Andrew Spielvogel followed closely with 40th- and 41st-place finishes, respectively.
“Overall, on the alpine side, we’re making progress,” Kankainen said. “Our men have been very fast in training, but we just have to build the consistency to put that speed into races.”
On the whole, the performances of the four Harvard teams are encouraging, particularly because the skiing program has only recently begun to gain real competitiveness and attention.
“We just celebrated our 75th anniversary,” City said of the skiing program. “But [it’s] only in the past five or ten years that we’ve started putting effort into getting our team to a competitive level in the league.”
According to City, this progress has been made by a steady coaching staff, support from the athletic department, and stronger recruiting classes.
“We have some talented athletes who came in with the freshman class,” City said. “Now, we’re really starting to catch up with the rest of the league.”
The carnival at St Michael’s this weekend offered an opportunity to see the new and seasoned talent of the team in action.
“This is by far the strongest team we’ve had in a long time,” Kankainen said. “We’re looking forward to good results in the upcoming weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before the Harvard and Brown women’s swimming teams met at Blodgett Pool on Saturday, there was little doubt who the better team was—one was undefeated, and one hadn’t won a meet since November.
When the meet’s final race was over, nothing had changed.
The Crimson (5-0, 5-0 Ivy) swept the Bears (2-5, 1-3 Ivy) Saturday to take a 177-66 victory in a meet where many of its swimmers were competing in events outside their specialty.
“I think we were really pleasantly surprised by the fact that we were able to win all of our races,” co-captain Alexandra Clarke said. “We put in a lineup where people weren’t swimming their best events.”
Clarke is a freestyler who won the 1000-yard event in last year’s Ivy League Championships. And while she won that race on Saturday—leading a Crimson sweep of the top four spots—she also took home the victory in the 100-yard butterfly.
“[Clarke] always races to win,” junior Katy Hinkle said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen her race the 100 butterfly before, but she did a great job.”
Hinkle was arguably the brightest star in a meet where Harvard had many. The junior led the 200-yard medley relay squad to a victory in the first event of the day, as the Crimson defeated Brown’s second-place lineup by .21 seconds.
“I love the relays,” Hinkle said. “It’s not just about me.”
It was all about Hinkle in the 50-yard freestyle, which the junior won with a time of 23.92 seconds. Hinkle chose to compete in the event, which she considers to be one of her stronger races, in preparation for next weekend’s Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet and the upcoming Ivy Championships.
“[The 50-yard freestyle] is hard to do without practice because it’s so short,” she said.
Hinkle’s third victory came in the 200-yard freestyle relay, the last event of the day, in which her team knocked off the senior entry of Clarke, Natalia Festa, Katie Faulkner, and Sophie Morgan.
But the foursome, along with co-captain Kay Foley, wanted one more go-around on Senior Day, so all five of them competed in an unofficial exhibition relay at the end of the meet.
“It was just a fun way for them to finish,” Harvard coach Stephanie Morawski said.
Before the Senior Day meet, the five seniors were honored for their contributions to the team over the years.
“For the seniors, it’s been a long four seasons,” Clarke said. “It was nice in our last [dual] swim meet at home to be able to get the win.”
Among the Crimson’s accomplishments over the years was last year’s Ivy title—one Harvard will defend back in Blodgett in late February. The Crimson can only hope its next trip goes as well as this one did.
Junior Kate Mills won the 200-yard freestyle and the 400-yard individual medley, while classmates Holly Furman and Christine Kaufmann and sophomore Meghan Leddy also claimed individual victories.
The Crimson swept the diving events as well, as junior Jenny Reese won the three-meter dive and sophomore Leslie Rea led a top-four sweep on the one-meter board.
But Saturday’s meet was likely the last of Harvard’s drama-free victories. The pressure will increase exponentially in the coming weeks as Harvard takes on Yale and Princeton at the Tigers’ DeNunzio Pool. Like the Crimson, Princeton is undefeated, and Yale just surrendered a four-meet winning streak to Navy on Saturday. It was with these races in mind that Morawski decided to mix up the lineup.
“Our plan was to go in there with a little bit of an off lineup and try to have some really good races,” she said.
By switching people around, Morawski sought to increase the competiveness of the races, forcing her swimmers to pay more attention to detail.
“We were making sure people were doing the little things rights: don’t breathe from the flags, fire it in the wall,” Morawski said. “It was an opportunity for us to focus on technical details. Against Princeton and Yale, we’ll be able to not worry about little things—hopefully those will be automatic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team came out strong this past weekend, narrowly topping Ivy League opponent Brown (2-6, 1-3 Ivy) on Friday and blowing out cross-town rival Boston University (5-4) on Saturday. The wins raise the Crimson’s record to 6-1 (5-0) for the season.
The weekend also marked the last home meets of the Harvard seniors’ collegiate swimming careers. The Crimson celebrated Senior Day in Blodgett Pool by thrashing the Terriers, 201-99.
“It was a tale of two different meets this weekend,” co-captain Tommy Gray said. “Against Brown we came out kind of flat—I think we underestimated them a bit...Saturday against BU was the complete opposite.”
HARVARD 201, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 99
Harvard powered past the Terriers Saturday, claiming 13 of the day’s 16 events to post its second-largest winning margin of the season.
In the culmination of a dominant diving weekend for the Crimson, junior Zac Ranta took first in both the one-meter and three-meter events. Ranta claimed the one-meter dive with a score of 274.50, followed closely behind by freshman Michael Stanton, who posted a 273.00.
Sophomore Niall Janney captured the 400-yard individual medley and the 200-yard butterfly, with a 4:04.08 finish in the 400-yard race. Janney touched the wall in 1:52.48 in the butterfly event, followed by freshman Ryan Cutter and sophomore Ross Ford for a 1-2-3 finish.
Sophomore Rob Newell was the third Harvard athlete to claim two individual events on the day, bringing home the gold in the 100-yard and 200-yard backstroke. Newell finished the 100-yard race in 51.62 and posted a 1:51.04 finish for the 200-yard backstroke.
Senior Mason Brunnick and co-captain Alex Meyer combined for three victories in the distance freestyle races. Brunnick claimed the 200-yard and 500-yard events in times of 1:41.28 and 4:32.82, respectively, while Meyer finished the 1000-yard freestyle in 9:18.62 for the win.
Junior Justin Davidson grabbed two races for Harvard, adding to the Crimson’s already-sizeable lead. Davidson placed first in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 58.24 and the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:06.13.
Sophomore Nicholas Tan wrapped up the day’s individual wins with a victory in the 100-yard butterfly. Tan touched the wall in 50.37.
Harvard also bested the Terriers in the 200-yard medley relay. The team of juniors Jordan Diekema and Will Heyburn, freshman Owen Wurzbacher, and sophomore Eric Taylor captured the race with a time of 1:33.33.
“From top to bottom, everyone swam really well,” Gray said. “It was a really good way to get the momentum going for next weekend.”
HARVARD 127, BROWN 116
Harvard squeaked by Brown on Friday to keep its undefeated conference record intact.
“The Brown meet was a little rougher than we expected,” Brunnick said. “The second half of the meet we were able to get our act together, but the first half we were losing close races.”
Brunnick himself claimed Harvard’s first victory of the contest in the 1000-yard freestyle. The senior finished with a time of 9:32.37, followed by freshman Greg Roop at 9:38.36.
The Bears bested the Crimson in the next six events, but Harvard stayed strong and fought back in the 100-yard freestyle. Tan won the event for his team with a 46.49 finish, while Heyburn took second in 46.63.
Meyer and junior Blake Lewkowitz led the charge in the 500-yard freestyle, claiming first and second place, respectively. Meyer posted a 4:36.63 finish, while Lewkowitz touched the wall in 4:43.25.
Wurzbacher won the 100-yard breaststroke in a close race with Brown’s Conor Carlucci, beating out the Brown swimmer with a time of 57.33.
But Harvard secured its victory through its divers, who captured both of the contest’s diving events. Ranta and Stanton brought home the top two places in the three-meter dive with scores of 331.88 and 313.28, respectively. Stanton took the one-meter event as well, keeping the divers’ record perfect for the weekend’s dual meets.
The Crimson will face its toughest competition of the season next weekend in the two-day Harvard-Yale-Princeton (HYP) meet, held in the Tigers’ home pool.
“It’s going to be really interesting and a great challenge,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We need to be prepared to swim better than we have all year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The turnaround has begun for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
After a dismal start to the season, no one has been able to beat the Crimson (5-10-3, 5-5-3 ECAC) in its last four games. In that same stretch, the team has outscored its opponents, 14-7.
“We’ve worked hard in practice,” freshman forward Louis Leblanc said. “We worked a lot on our offensive play, and all four lines have been clicking lately, and we’re starting to put the puck in the net.”
Notably, Harvard also notched its first away win since its Oct. 30 season opener against Dartmouth with a 4-1 win over No. 13 Union (13-5-5, 7-1-3 ECAC) on Friday night at Messa Rink. The Crimson then skated to a 3-3 tie with Rensselaer (13-11-2, 6-5-1 ECAC) the following evening at Houston Field House.
“It’s very difficult winning on the road in our league, and we’re very happy with the result and getting three out of the four points this weekend—especially at places [like] Union and RPI with their atmosphere and the support they have,” captain Alex Biega said. “We’re happy to have found our stride this week, and it’s definitely a positive sign.”
HARVARD 3, RENSSELAER 3
Leblanc once again proved to be the key playmaker on Saturday night against a stalwart Engineers defense.
With less than three seconds left in regulation, the rookie slammed home the rebound from sophomore Alex Killorn’s shot to give the Harvard the tying goal and send the game into overtime.
“I got one shot,” Leblanc said. “The goalie made a great save, and after that I was able to jam it into the net. It was a great feeling to be able to tie the game for the team.”
Despite holding a 3-2 shot advantage during extra time, the Crimson wasn’t able to carry forward its third-period goal-scoring momentum. Harvard scored all three of its goals in the final frame of regulation.
Down 2-0 at the action-packed start of the third, Killorn got things going for the Crimson just 20 seconds into the period when he found the back of the net following a Renssealer turnover forced by Leblanc.
Though the Engineers were able to get one back less than a minute later, Harvard again pulled to within one when senior forward Doug Rogers fired home a shot from the left hash-mark to make it 3-2 with 2:30 to go in the frame.
“We just had to elevate our game going into the third,” Leblanc said. “We had a good pep talk and we came out strong. We kept battling hard and were able to tie the game up.”
HARVARD 4, UNION 1
The Crimson notched its third-consecutive win over a ranked opponent when it handed the Dutchmen their first league loss of the season on Friday.
Junior goaltender Ryan Carroll made a career-high 47 saves as Harvard overcame a blistering Union offense that outshot the Crimson, 48-25. With the win, Carroll improves his record to 3-2-1 overall.
“[Carroll] and Kyle Richter have been stellar when they’ve been on,” Biega said. “As of late, Carroll’s had great performances and carried the team along and has made some great saves.”
With Carroll at the helm of Harvard’s defensive efforts, the Crimson shut the Dutchmen down on the power play, holding the fifth-ranked unit 1-for-8 on the night.
The Crimson offense was led by the excellent play of a group of underclassmen. Early in the second period, freshman Conor Morrison shot home sophomore Eric Kroshus’ rebound for the team’s first goal just two minutes after the Dutchmen got on the board, knotting the game at one.
Kroshus then tallied the game-winner at 12:07 in same frame when he deflected a shot from Biega into the net.
“[Kroshus] definitely brings a big element to our team,” Biega said. “We’re not really a big offensive team, and we really rely on our defensive play. But it’s nice to see guys like Eric, who’s a very skilled forward, score goals and get rewarded.”
Freshmen Danny Biega and Alex Fallstrom added insurance goals late in the third after Union goaltender Keith Kinkaid was pulled with just over a minute left in regulation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If Harvard keeps getting results like this at home, it may want to host a few more meets next season. The Crimson track and field team welcomed Connecticut and Brown for the Harvard Select Meet on Saturday, the squad’s second of three-straight events at Gordon Track and Tennis Center. The women won the contest in a dual matchup with Brown, 65-57, while the men finished second behind the Huskies with 45 points.
“It was the first time [this season] that we came together for a team score,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “To be able to beat Ivy League rival Brown...was a great step for the program, but we still have work to do.”
Harvard enjoyed a number of dominant performances on the day and added another IC4A and ECAC qualifier. Sophomore Darcy Wilson earned his invitation to IC4As with a 1:54.88 in the 800 meters, good for second place. Still, the young runner was not completely successful, as Connecticut’s Alex Bennatan took the event by just six thousandths of a second.
“Darcy is a great competitor, and that’s two weeks in a row that he’s been able to qualify for IC4As in an event,” Saretsky said. “Each time it’s come down to the absolute wire.”
Junior high jumper Dina Emde did not have to sweat out such a close finish as she cruised to an ECAC bid. The Crimson notched a sweep of the event, taking all four places, as Emde came out on top with a jump of 1.70 meters. Harvard’s dominance in the event showed that the women’s high jump continues to be a Crimson strength, even after the departure of four-time All-American Becky Christensen ’09.
“The women’s high jump has a great tradition at Harvard, and we’ve got some outstanding athletes this year,” Saretsky said. “It was fun to see Dina get the ECAC qualifier this early in the season.”
But the high jump was not the only strong performance for the Crimson women, as the squad took six events on the day. Although some races featured very few competitors, Harvard still took encouragement from individual winners Olivia Weeks, Sydnie Leroy, and Ashtynn Baltimore—all rookies. Weeks took the long jump in 5.53 meters, while Leroy claimed the pole vault title and Baltimore the 60-meter dash.
“The freshmen have done an outstanding job,” Saretsky said. “They’ve handled the transition well in part because of the great leadership of our upperclassmen...but also because they want to get after it and shake things up.”
In addition to its standout crop of freshmen, the Crimson demonstrated tremendous depth throughout its roster, as Harvard claimed both the 4 x 440-meter and distance medley relays. The 4 x 440 team topped Brown by nearly 10 seconds.
While the men could not post as dominant results against a talented Huskies squad, the hosts still notched a number of noteworthy results. The Crimson took three individual events, as well as the distance medley relay, and perhaps no effort was more impressive than co-captain Jack Brady’s double win in the shot put and weight throw.
The IC4A qualifier continued his run of solid performances, notching personal bests in the shot (16.53 meters) and the weight (18.20 meters). Brady and Crimson freshman Edward Brucker were the only two competitors to place in the top nine of both events.
“[Brady] has been doing a great job,” co-captain Justin Grinstead said. “All season he’s been performing, setting personal bests...He has a really good, competitive spirit.”
Rookie Kenneth Kan Wang also enjoyed an individual win, jumping 6.72 meters to take the long jump by a healthy margin, and junior Brian Hill placed second in his first 400-meter race of the indoor season.
With so many standout efforts early in its indoor campaign, Harvard knows it is well prepared for the conference meets.
“In years past, with reading period and exams we haven’t been able to have as good training [at this point in the season],” Grinstead explained. “Now we’re able to focus on training and getting into a really competitive position.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It can only go up from here for the Harvard men’s volleyball team (0-2), which lost its first two contests of the season this weekend against Juniata (1-1) and St. Francis (5-1) over the weekend.
The Crimson expects to keep improving over the course of the season, after following up a 3-0 loss to Juniata in the Kennedy Sports and Recreation Center with a 3-1 loss to St. Francis in DeGol Arena. The improvement was palpable, but both games ended in disappointment.
“They’re two of the toughest teams on the schedule,” sophomore Matt Jones said. “It kind of showed us where we are and what we need to work on.”
ST. FRANCIS 3, HARVARD 1
Jones had just recorded his 17th kill of day to give the Crimson a 28-27 lead in the fourth game when St. Francis’s Alex Fortney made an attack error to put Harvard up by two. It looked like the Crimson, down two games to one, was due for a rally.
But the squad was undone by its own errors.
The first of these was a service error—Harvard’s kryptonite the day before against Juniata. Three attack mistakes later, the match was over and the Red Flash was walking victorious.
“We had a chance to push it to the 5th game,” Jones said. “[There were] a couple small errors, mental breakdowns on our side.”
The ending spoiled a game in which the Crimson showed it could compete with a top-15 team.
“I thought we showed moments of brilliance,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “As our coach was saying, we know we can play at this level. It’s going to take practice and hard work.”
St. Francis came out strong early, taking the first game 28-22, but Harvard was able to rally, winning the second game 32-30.
“We showed them that they had to take us seriously,” Weintraub said. “They started off really well...we weren’t in the right frame of mind. As the game wore on, we started to figure them out.”
But even in the second game—the Crimson’s lone victory of the weekend—errors pushed it to the brink. After Harvard took a 29-23 lead, the Red Flash won six consecutive points to even the score.
“We let them get a service run,” Jones explained.
This time the Crimson was able to hold on for the victory, but St. Francis apparently learned its lesson, winning the next game, 30-24, before the fourth-game heartbreaker.
JUNIATA 3, HARVARD 0
Sometimes it really is just a matter of getting the ball over the net. The Crimson learned that lesson the hard way as it racked up 21 service errors in its Saturday loss.
“We had the first-match-of-the-year jitters,” Jones said.
Serving woes kept Harvard on the defensive end of things all night, but it was the Eagles’ defense that shined, earning a 9.0-6.5 advantage in blocks.
“Because they outserved us, we were out of the system,” Jones said. “The block on the other side of the net was always set up better. We allowed them to play better defense and get more blocks.”
But even in Saturday’s sweep, the Crimson got better over the course of the match.
After losing the first game, 30-22, it came one point closer in the second (30-23) and drew within one point at the end of the third game before falling, 30-27.
The weekend was far from a success, but the men’s volleyball team can take solace in sustained improvement throughout its pair of contests. Combine that improved play with strong performances from freshmen—Rob Lothman had 33 assists and four kills Saturday while Derek Jansma had nine digs—and the Crimson may even have cause for optimism.
“Everyone stepped up their games,” Weintraub said. “We have a lot to look forward to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s squash team’s quest for an undefeated season came to an end on Saturday, as the No. 5 Crimson (4-1)  fell, 7-2, to No. 3 Rochester (5-2) after a series of close point-for-point matches ended in the Yellowjackets’ favor.
“We were prepared, we weren’t outclassed, we were hanging with them until the very end, but it just went the other way,” co-captain Frank Cohen said.
With a 3-0 win by co-captain Colin West in the No. 1 spot against Rochester captain Jim Bristow, Harvard looked to be ready for another comeback win reminiscent of last year’s 5-4 victory. But with junior Reed Endresen and freshman Jason Michas fighting a 2-2 battle at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots, respectively, the scent of victory started to vanish.
“It was mixed emotions,” Crimson head coach Satinder Bajwa said. “On the one hand, it was our first match of [2010] and playing such a tough team, it’s hard to come out playing your best because we haven’t had as many match practices.”
“On the other hand, we played the No. 3 team, who was as high as two,” Bajwa continued. “It’s very tight up there. No. 2, 3, and 4 have all beaten each other and we are five, so we showed we belong among these groups.”
In addition to West’s win, No. 9 Alexander Ma and No. 10 Alex Lavoie defeated their counterparts, both by 3-0 sweeps, but that would be all for Harvard.
Yet even with the Yellowjackets abuzz after their first win of the day by Benjamin Fischer over Crimson sophomore Richard Hill, Harvard—particularly Michas and Endresen—did not go down quietly.
“This could easily have been 6-3 or 5-4 if we had won the two tight games at No. 4 and No. 5,” Bajwa said.
Playing on neighboring courts, Endresen and Michas quickly reached 1-0 leads. Endresen continued the momentum to 2-0 before allowing Rochester’s William Newnham to pull even with close 11-9 and 11-7 wins. In the final game, Endresen and Newnham continued shot-for-shot before Newnham scored six-straight points to end the match.
Michas had more resistance from his counterpart, as each player claimed two games apiece before entering the fifth. Up 9-7, Michas could taste victory before Yellowjacket Matthew Domenick snapped out four corner shots for the win.
“I think a lot of this came down to a couple points here or there, some mental mistakes, and some people on Rochester stepping up,” Cohen said. “A couple of matches were even, so at that point the whole match comes down to a series of two to five points and in those instances, for the most part, Rochester was able to pull it out.”
Down by three team points going into the court switch, the atmosphere at Barnaby Courts darkened for Harvard, as its four-game winning streak seemed in jeopardy.
“Our goal overall has been Ivy League-focused, so in the grand scheme of things it’s not the end of the world,” Cohen said. “But it’s tough to have a first loss of the season, especially after we have been training so hard.”
For the Yellowjackets, a win against the Crimson felt like redemption after its 8-1 loss to No. 1 Trinity the day before. With the end of Michas and Endresen’s matches, a disappointed Crimson team began to focus its sights on playing the top team in the nation next weekend.
“We are going to work on some crisis situations,” Bajwa said. “We are going to work on sharpening our match temperament this week, and we are going to learn from this match and see where we could have done a little better in terms of being more competitive in a situation where its 50-50, where one or two points can make the difference.”
“I truly believe that a team that is expecting big things but is somewhat of an underdog has to have lessons like these,” Bajwa added. “A tough loss like [Saturday’s], I think is going to make us better for the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first tournament of the decade brought unusual results for the Harvard fencing team, as the No. 7 men far exceeded expectations and the previously-unbeaten No. 3 women dropped every match at the St. John’s Invitational yesterday.
The men (6-5) fell in their opening match to defending national champion and current No. 1 Penn State, 20-7. The foil squad was disappointing in its 9-0 blanking at the paws of the Nittany Lions, but the sabre squad, led by sophomore Valentin Staller, held the upper hand, 5-4.
After falling to No. 2 Notre Dame, 19-8, the Crimson men engineered a pair of surprising upsets with a 15-12 victory over No. 3 Ohio State and a 16-11 win over No. 5 Columbia.
“I thought the men did particularly well,” senior epee Karl Harmenberg said. “These are the best teams in America...basically the top six teams in the country overall. Beating Ohio State was a nice surprise, and I think the win against Columbia gave us confidence and hopefully we can repeat come Ivies.”
The sabre squad was the bright squad for the men, holding the edge in all of its first four matches. But the group was unable to run the table, as a 6-3 deficit made the difference in a 14-13 loss to host St. John’s.
“This was easily the toughest tournament of the year in terms of competition,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “The men performed extremely well and I truly thought they were fantastic. They got the job done for us today.”
It was a different story for the women (7-5), who have been the more successful squad of late.
After going undefeated in last year’s St. John’s Invitational, the women posted an 0-5 mark this time around. After defeating No. 1 Penn State 14-13 in November’s Harvard Invitational and riding high after a 24-3 drubbing of Tufts, the Crimson fell to Penn State, 17-10, at St. John’s.
Unfortunately for the Harvard women, this would be their closest match of the tournament.
The Crimson also fell, 17-10, to No. 6 Ohio State and No. 2 Notre Dame. The women rounded out the tournament with an 18-9 loss to No. 4 Columbia and a 19-8 loss to unranked St. John’s.
Harvard was hurt considerably by the absence of co-captain epee Noam Mills, who was competing at the World Cup.
“It certainly would’ve made a difference if Noam had been able to be with us,” Brand said. “She can win her own matches, and she certainly helps the squad as a whole. Missing any one of them would have a huge impact on our performance. They had a great attitude, though, and performed with great spirit. It’s a long season, and I’m pleased with everyone’s performance.”
Brand cited the exceptionally long winter break as a cause of rustiness at the tournament.
“We definitely had a problem coming off such an unusually long break and then going to the toughest tournament in the nation,” Brand said. “We suffered from a conditioning standpoint...you have to be in tip-top shape to perform at these tournaments, and we have to work on taking better care of our bodies.”
Despite the disappointing performance by the women, the men’s breakthrough afternoon bodes well for future competitions.
“There’s definitely room for improvement on the concentration side,” Harmenberg said. “We trained a lot leading up to this, and I think we’ll be able to build on this for future improvement.”
The men’s team, which has lately been just a step behind the women on the national scene, may have gained the confidence to balance the dominance of the women.
“I saw a significant difference in the men, who have been struggling over the past two years,” Brand said. “They are trending up, and it is a very good trend.”
The fencing team will next see action this Saturday when it squares off with Brandeis, Duke, and Yeshiva.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team sent future opponents an early warning message on Saturday that the team will be a force this spring season. The Crimson swept its cross-town rivals, the Boston University Terriers, in singles and doubles play. The 65th-ranked Harvard women met the No. 61-ranked Terriers at the Murr Center for both squads’ first dual match up of the spring. The Crimson overwhelmed BU, winning the singles matches, 6-0, and the doubles competitions, 3-0.
Harvard met the Terriers this past fall when the Crimson hosted the Harvard Fall Classic in mid-September. BU played tough through that tournament, but the Crimson, powered by their freshmen talent, prevailed. This time the Terriers had an even more daunting task, as BU was short a couple of players due to injury and forfeited the No. 6 singles slot and the No. 3 doubles position. Despite the default wins, the freshmen and sophomores that compose the majority of Harvard’s roster showcased a great deal of skill and ability through Saturday’s contested matches.
“The past two years we’ve lost our first spring match up against BU even though I thought we were always a better team,” junior captain Sam Rosekrans said. “This year we’re young but we have a better lineup, so we were able to start off stronger than ever before.”
At the No. 1 singles spot, sophomore Holly Cao—the 79th-ranked ITA player nationally—defeated Stefanie Nunic in two sets, 6-4, 6-4.
The Crimson’s four freshmen each walked away with a win at their respective singles positions as well.  The 86th nationally-ranked player, Hideko Tachibana, led the charge when she battled her Terrier opponent, Francine Whu, through three sets. After dropping the second set in a tiebreaker, the rookie regained her composure and came back to win the match, 6-1, 6-7(8), 6-3.
Classmate Kristin Norton followed Tachibana’s lead in the No. 3 contest, delivering Petra Santini a 6-3, 6-3 loss.
“I thought the freshmen did a great job handling nerves and they brought a lot of energy out on the court,” Crimson coach Traci Green said. “Tachibana and Kristin Norton especially had some strong matches out here.”
At the No. 4 position, rookie Sophie Chang, ranked 95th nationally, rallied back to defeat Monika Mical in the second and third sets after falling to Mical in the first set, 6-3. Chang fought for each point in the final two sets against Mical to come out ahead, 7-5, 10-5.
Junior Agnes Sibilski clinched the singles sweep for the Crimson with a win at the No. 5 spot, because Harvard’s final freshman on the roster, Alex Lehman, won her match by default at the No. 6 position. Sibilski blew past her opponent, Inayat Khosla, in two sets, 6-2, 6-4.
In doubles’ play, Cao teamed up with Rosekrans to win the No. 1 match over Whu and Mical, 8-5. The freshmen duo of Norton and Tachibana won the No. 2 contest against Terriers Nunic and Santini, 8-2.
“Kristin and Hideko played doubles with a ton of energy,” Rosekrans said. “Kristin really brought out the best in Hideko and they’ll make a strong doubles team for this season.”
BU had to forfeit its final doubles contest of the afternoon at the No. 3 spot due to injury, so Chang and sophomore partner Samantha Gridley came away with the default victory.
Harvard carries a lot of youth on its roster, but its solid performances early in the spring season may indicate future success down the road.
“We are a really strong team but our goal continues to be just to train the right way, to train the way we want to play matches,” Green said. “So far it has been working and we just have to keep taking it one match at a time.”
The Crimson will travel to Waco, Texas later this week to compete against Baylor University on Friday, Jan. 29th, and then against Brown and Nevada on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After getting off to a rocky start, the Harvard men’s tennis team was able to find its rhythm at the Hokie Challenge hosted by Virginia Tech.
The Crimson traveled to the Burrow-Burleson Tennis Center in Blacksburg, Va., to take part in a round-robin weekend tournament, which also featured No. 23 Auburn University, No. 27 Virginia Tech, College of Charleston, and Indiana University. Day one was not kind to Harvard, as the squad fell in 10 out of 12 matches to the highest-ranked opponent at the competition. But the Crimson fought back throughout the weekend, recording several key wins to keep the team in the tournament.
“I thought the guys did great this weekend,” Harvard coach Dave Fish said. “We really liked what we saw, especially since the caliber of competition was very high. We were in these matches.”
The tournament stood as a good indicator for the young Crimson team of where it stands after a fairly successful fall season that included many highlights. One such standout effort came at the end of the season when sophomore Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen won the ITA Northeast Regional doubles championship. After a hiatus of over two months without tournament play, Harvard sought to build on its momentum, but it could not keep pace with the Tigers.
Junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans faced Auburn’s Tim Puetz in the Flight A Singles match. Chijoff-Evans dropped both sets, 6-3, 6-2, to the German-born junior, who had a good campaign in the fall. In the Flight B Singles match, Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien also fell in straight sets to Alex Stamchev, 6-3, 6-4.
Nguyen didn’t have much luck either as the rookie looked to pull out a win in the second set of the Flight C Singles match. He came up short against freshman Tiger Tim Hewitt, 6-3, 7-5. Hewitt was one of five freshmen for Auburn who contributed significantly to the success of the Tigers over the weekend.
Nguyen earned a measure of retribution, though, in the Flight B doubles match when he paired up with Felton once again to take on Hewitt and Lucas Lopasso. In a back-and-forth match, the Crimson edged out Auburn to take the win, 9-8.
The only other Harvard victory on the first day came in the Flight D singles match. Freshman Joshua Tchan took the match from Lopasso, 6-4, 6-3.
“It would be highly unusual if we were ready for that [level of competition] yet,” Fish said. “We can match shot for shot, but [Auburn] can do it longer and with fewer errors. [Still], what we saw from our guys thus far is very encouraging.”
The Crimson came back strong on the second day of the round-robin tournament to repeat what Auburn had done to the team a day earlier. Harvard took 10 of 12 matches in a convincing defeat of the College of Charleston.
In the Flight A Singles match, Chijoff-Evans had to battle for the win against Lucas Koncilla. After Chijoff-Evans won the first set 6-3, Koncilla reciprocated with a 6-3 win of his own before dropping the last set, 6-1. Omodele-Lucien won his Flight B singles match against Michael Trintignac, 6-3, 6-3.
Nguyen won his singles match as well, defeating Mickael Boyer 6-3, 6-4. Tchan couldn’t pull out another win on day two, falling to Tom Delme, 7-6 (22), 6-2.The Crimson also fared well in doubles play, recording wins in the top two flights and one in Flight D.
Harvard advanced to the last day of tournament play, facing host Virginia Tech in several tough contests. Chijoff-Evans couldn’t overcome the momentum Yoann Re garnered from a close first set win, 7-5, as the top Crimson competitor also dropped the second set, 6-3. Omodele-Lucien and Nguyen dropped their singles matches as well—both ending the weekend with a record of 1-2—while Tchan capped off a solid performance by defeating No. 100 Sebastien Jacques, 6-4, 0-6, 7-5. Tchan also teamed up with sophomore Davis Mangham to win the Flight D doubles match. Captain Michael Hayes praised the talented rookie’s effort, but gave credit to the entire squad for getting better through its matches.
“Josh Tchan was definitely our top performer this weekend,” Hayes said. “There was a lot of improvement. Even though the first day there was some rust, the next two days we got things done. We got a lot of practice matches against good quality opposition, so it was a great warm-up tournament.”

As we drove back into Cambridge  this past weekend, the river sparkled, glossed over with a sheet of  ice. There seemed to be a firmness to the ice, a solidity that beckoned…  But beware: DO NOT attempt to walk across the iced-over Charles. If  you do so, YOU WILL DIE. (Not actually. That was hyperbole. But really,  it’s actually unsafe.)
Winthrop students, whose House is located right on the Charles, are probably most susceptible to the river's call. So as  a preemptory safety measure, Winthrop’s resident dean sent the following  e-mail to his house. It is written with wit—but not in jest.
Winthropians,
A short public safety announcement:
I just heard from HUPD about  some folks wandering out on the iced over Charles River recently. So  I thought I would remind you all that this is very, very unsafe. Perhaps  more so now with the temporary warming temperatures, but it is never  safe.
For those of you looking for  an explanation, the short version is that the river is moving water.  So it freezes incrementally and not at all consistently. The ice may  be thick in some places and not as thick in others. And it can change  rapidly (during the day and overnight). So just because some idiot made  it across, leaving his footprints, you might easily fall through following  the same path a few hours or a day later.
If you fall through the ice,  you will die. The current will suck you under. And the extremely cold  water will quickly immobilize you physically (and mentally) such that  it is nearly impossible to pull yourself up and out even if you manage  to not get sucked under right away.
Some ice can be safe (see http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/recreation/ice_safety.htm). Frozen ponds are where hockey started.  And some people enjoy ice fishing (no idea why). But that is for ponds  and small lakes - iced over rivers are NEVER SAFE.
So please stay off the river  ice!
Thanks,
Gregg 
Indeed, please do not wander out into  the river. Sometimes, there is a reason that the road less travelled remains untrod.

If you're one of those Harvard students who's been missing the local cuisine throughout J-Term, you may be in luck. The opportunity has come to indulge in as much greasy fast food as you can, with the added benefit of a prize incentive—and eternal glory for yourself and Harvard.
This month, Qdoba is launching its Sixth Annual Rice and Bean Pot, a burrito eating contest and benefit for Kevin Youkilis Hits for Kids.
Up to 25 teams of four can compete from each individual college in the preliminary rounds. The competition to determine which team will represent Harvard will take place on Saturday, Feb. 6 at 4 p.m. in the Harvard Square Qdoba. The team with the toughest tummies will then face off against the other schools (including competitors from Boston University, Boston College, and Northeastern University) on Feb. 10, at an event headlined by “Bad Rabbits,” a Boston-area band. The winning team will win four tickets to Mexico. The tickets are non-refundable, meaning it will be impossible to spend their value on a personal trainer afterward, but the opportunity to eat authentic burritos in Mexico is probably too good to pass up.

If you're a student who prefers train travel over buses and planes, Amtrak has good news for you. Acela Express trains will have free wireless Internet starting this March. But be sure to book that trip soon, as the Internet will be free for passengers only in its initial stages.
According to a news release detailing Amtrak's plans for 2010, several other improvements are also coming to the Acela trains later this year—including leather seats and improved tray tables and outlets.
The Acela Express, which connects Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C., takes less time than regional trains but is often more expensive than buses or other trains.
We at FlyBy certainly appreciate Amtrak's efforts. But even with all these newfangled additions, the Acela Express still might not be worth all that extra cash for us poor college students.

We're back with our second installment of our shopping week feature, this time with classes good enough to watch—and not just through lecture videos.
Before we get to our list, we have some gossip to share. We heard that Adam E. Cohen '01, an assistant professor who teaches Physical Sciences 1: "Chemical Bonding, Energy, and Reactivity: An Introduction to the Physical Sciences," popped hydrogen-filled balloons, certainly an explosive and delightful start for Harvard's beloved pre-meds. In Historical Study A-87: "Madness and Medicine: Themes in the History of Psychiatry," we heard that students got to watch an intense video of an argument between Tom Cruise and NBC's Matt T. Lauer about the legitimacy of psychiatry, leading to an equally heated conversation in a packed Science Center B.
In what we can call a class with a huge payoff, we heard that in Computer Science 179: "Design of Usable Interactive Systems," students formed groups, and each group got an iPod Touch to use for the course. We're not sure whether they'll be able to keep them. The course Web site uses the word "loaned" to describe the state of the iPod, so probably not. But hey, a programmer can hope.
And now for the list! It’s Tuesday morning and shopping week has officially begun, but the closest encounter you’ve had with reality during the past five weeks is reality TV and unfortunately Harvard has yet to offer Culture and Belief 1819: "The Myth of the Guido on the Jersey Shore."
So what do you do? Take the courses that resemble your favorite TV shows. Here are our picks:
1. Ethical Reasoning 24: "Bioethics"
If you like House, study what Dr. Gregory House refuses to acknowledge: how ethics and medicine intersect. The course covers “moral dilemmas that pit health against freedom, prevention against rescue, and the claims of those with competing needs when life itself hangs in the balance.” | T., Th. 1-2:30. Link.
2. Sociology 171: "Sociology of Crime and Punishment"
If you like Law and Order, this class may be for you. This course, which covers crime and criminal justice trends, might just make you want to become a cop. We hope each class starts just like Law and Order. | M., W. 2. Link.
3. Literature and Arts B-85: "American Musicals and American Culture"
If Glee's Rachel Berry went to Harvard she’d enthusiastically take this class, which explores “the musical artistry and cultural resonances” of a number of iconic Broadway musicals, including Shuffle Along, Show Boat, The Cradle Will Rock, and Oklahoma! | T., Th. 12. Link.
4. Historical Study A-86: "Men and Women in Public and Private: the US in the 20th Century"
Mad Men’s just snagged its third consecutive Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Television Series. So we’re thinking that this course, which delves into “expectations for manhood and womanhood as they play out in family lives, work, popular culture and politics” couldn’t be more timely. | M. W., 12. Link.
5. Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation"
This course asks the questions: "Why do states wage war? Why do they cooperate? Have the answers changed historically?" The only question it won’t answer: "Why is Jack Bauer so damn badass?" | M., W., (F). 10. Link.
And if you like The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien, take a few painkillers. We’re truly very sorry for your loss, but feel free to e-mail us about stuff that's taking place in your classes.
