After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
VENICE, Italy—Millions of tourists pass through this city every year, receiving the same piece of advice: Don’t swim in the canal.
I’m not sure whether I disregarded that warning or missed it altogether. Either way, on my 19th birthday, I jumped into a Venetian canal.
It all began when my roommate planted the idea on the walk to my birthday dinner. I had heard the canals were sort of dirty, but how bad could they be? “Yeah, I think I’ll do it,” I replied to the surprise of the group. “Sounds like fun.”
Anticipation built during dinner. On the way to the canal they couldn’t contain themselves, giggling with excitement.
We arrived, and I stripped down to my boxers. I stood at the edge of the canal, took a breath, and leapt in.
The cold water enveloped me as my feet quickly hit the bottom. Some salty water passed through my lips, and I bobbed back to the surface to the cheering of the group. It was exhilarating. The others yanked me out of the canal, and we all trudged back to the dorms, I clad only in my soaking boxers.
But upon getting back to the residence the truth of what I had just done set in.
The canals aren’t just dirty. They’re filthy. After mentioning my jump to Italian students in my program, they looked at me like someone had just died. They told stories of people jumping in and requiring shots for God knows what diseases and bacteria. When Katherine Hepburn jumped into a canal during filming of the 1955 movie “Summertime,” she was temporarily blinded and reportedly had eye problems for the rest of her life.
But that was 1955. Where the canals used to contain sewage, they’re now filled with runoff from factories. I’m not very worried about blindness, but I am waiting to see how my third eye turns out.

TOULOUSE, France—Since June 22, the only thing more ubiquitous than the signs that scream “SOLDES” populating storefronts has been the crush of shoppers flocking to them.
Les soldes (in English, “sales”) are state-regulated, biannual sales held throughout France. The government designates two, six-week periods beginning in early January and late June for nationwide sales on anything from clothes to shoes to electronics. Discounts start low at about 25 percent and can reach 80 percent in the sales’ final days.
“A lot of women will take the first day of the sales off to get to those rare or special items,” my co-workers cautioned me. “So if there’s something that you have your eye on, you might want to get it early, even though the discount won’t be that much.”
Despite my short time here, I’ve noticed that French life revolves around several staples: wine, cigarettes, coffee, bread, cheese. But with the onset of the soldes, everything changes. Employees spend time pre-shopping on the Internet at work, and small talk is initiated with, “Are you going to the sales this weekend?” In effect, a country that is usually laidback and slow-paced becomes energized and even frenzied—all eyes on the prize.
Unlike the sporadic, holiday-weekend sales in the States, the government-regulated soldes don’t fall on a major holiday or anticipate a gift-giving extravaganza. There’s no real excuse—it’s shopping without a purpose beyond purchase. It’s enjoying the things in life that matter to you, whether an espresso and a cigarette, or a sundress at half price.
I made a couple of trips to the largest shopping street in Toulouse, Rue d’Alsace-Lorraine. The street was devoid of its normal automobile traffic, and even mopeds and bikes had trouble squeezing their way through the crowds. A musician played the accordion on a street corner, and a few well-placed carts sold cold refreshments to exhausted shoppers.
I didn’t buy anything. But I’ll be back to investigate the second round of price reductions—for the sake of journalism, of course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TURIN, Italy—Something to consider: If you are important, when you die, or maybe even before, most of your papers will be gathered and separated and catalogued. Probably they will be placed with care in chronological order, with thick white pieces of paper separating them in a cream-colored cardboard box. The box may have a white string that fastens it shut and it may live in a place with other such boxes—like a crematorium for your thoughts.
And if you are not particularly important, but rather a 21-year-old college student writing a thesis, you may find yourself in this strange kind of library for the dead’s private thoughts. Someone will have to send a fax explaining who you are. As you are waiting, you may begin to feel simultaneously very small and conscious of every part of your body—in particular, its sudden awkwardness. This whole time, since you arrived in Italy five days earlier, but even before, when you were writing grant applications and talking to your thesis advisor, you have had a creeping suspicion, which has evolved into a definite knowledge: You are a fraud.
 ...
No one ever showed me how to handle old papers. There must have been a class I missed; maybe someone mentioned the correct method one of the half a dozen times I went on a class trip to Houghton, but clearly I wasn’t paying attention. So when an archivist handed me a big box of papers that belonged to a man named Leone Ginzburg, a literary scholar and anti-fascist activist who was beaten and killed by a group of fascists in Rome in 1944, I was terrified. But the archivist just suggested that I proceed into the big room with the other scholars (other scholars?) and begin examining the documents.
There’s something inherently strange about reading letters that are not addressed to you. In the past weeks, I have rifled through the personal and business correspondences of both Leone and Natalia Ginzburg, totaling about 1,800 letters. I read exchanges about the deaths of loved ones, politics, literature, and career dissatisfaction. I took note of anything that seemed relevant to my thesis so as to request a photocopy.
But a couple days in something strange happened. I lost the ability to tell exactly what was relevant to my research, which is about Natalia Ginzburg’s translation of Du côté de chez Swann. I started marking down folio numbers of letters between Italo Calvino and Ginzburg about a new novel by Marguerite Duras, a telegram that Natalia received from her boss with condolences for the death of her child, a note from her son Carlo on his first paid job. It all seemed important.
I could read this woman’s handwriting; I knew that she never dated her letters. Armed with a neat little box of 1,400 letters, I had consumed her life. But the more I knew, the less I felt confident that I could judge what was “important,” which documents I ought to have shipped to my home. When you write a thesis about someone’s life, you are in a sense taking ownership of a past that is not your own, but what qualifies you to judge what matters, especially, when what you’re getting is only pieces of the other person?
Now, I know why I felt guilty when I was waiting for the archivist to give me a box: I was embarking on a project that would require me to eavesdrop on someone else’s life. Did the archivists, my thesis advisor, and whatever committee doles out grant money know? Could they tell I wasn’t a scholar, but rather just a little girl listening at a keyhole?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A judge has dismissed a lawsuit brought against Harvard Medical School Professor Douglas P. Kiel for a study he led on padded underwear meant to protect the elderly from hip fractures.
The Tuesday ruling in Norfolk Superior Court brought an end to the lawsuit in which HipSaver, a hip protector manufacturer based in Canton, Mass., sued Kiel for commercial disparagement.
The study, which came under fire from the Department of Health and Human Services for not fully disclosing risks of injury to its participants, concluded that hip protectors are not effective in preventing hip fractures. HipSaver alleged that the claim was damaging to its product.
However, in Tuesday's ruling, Associate Justice Barbara A. Dortch-Okara found that because HipSaver would not be presenting evidence that either directly contests the study's conclusion or alleges that Kiel was acting maliciously, commercial disparagement could not be proven.
HipSaver filed the suit on Feb. 15, 2008.
Kiel still faces scrutiny from the HHS Division of Compliance Oversight. In a 13-page letter sent to research administrators at institutions affiliated with the study, federal health regulators said that the researchers did not keep participants informed of risks they discovered as the study progressed.
The study design, which involved fitting patients with underwear that had padding only on one side, resulted in participants falling more frequently to the side with padding compared to the side without padding. When researchers noticed this trend, they failed to disclose it to participants, HHS said.
HipSaver said it requested this investigation, resulting in HHS requiring researchers to contact participants to inform them of the risk of falling on one side.

Health care services and survival rates at small, remote hospitals are significantly worse than at other hospitals, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study published Wednesday.
These smaller hospitals, called critical access hospitals, have less in terms of advanced cardiac capabilities, intensive care units, and digital health records, the study found.
Additionally, in the 30-day period following treatment for heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia, patients were 30 to 70 percent more likely to die at critical access hospitals than at other hospitals.
Harvard School of Public Health research fellow Karen E. Joynt led the study, which was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Wednesday. The study examined over 2.3 million medical records for Medicare recipients from 2008 to 2009 at 4,738 hospitals across the country. Of these hospitals, critical access hospitals comprise 26.8 percent.
“Because Critical Access Hospitals have been exempted from most national quality improvement efforts, we really knew little about their quality or clinical outcomes prior to this study, and we were most surprised at the magnitude of the differences between CAHs and other hospitals," Joynt said in an email.
Those differences will likely grow as advancements in technology and modern medicine leave these smaller hospitals behind. According to the study, these studies face a lack of resources, which forms one of the biggest hurdles these hospitals must face when trying to deliver care comparable to more urban, well-funded hospitals.
"They are small, isolated, and financially vulnerable, and they serve a population that is getting older and poorer," Joynt said.
Joynt said that heeding the advice of rural health specialists is a move that would help improve care nationwide.
“They are the ones who best understand the challenges these hospitals face and who might have great ideas for how we could address them from the policy standpoint," she said.
