After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As people across the U.S. shuffle through airport security en route to their Thanksgiving destinations this coming week, protestors of the new Advanced Imaging Technology scanners are encouraging travelers to opt out of the scanning process and ask to be pat down instead. Although pat-downs are a worthwhile option to account for cultural opposition to the images the scanners produce, these “naked image” scanners are an important security measure that is worth the invasion of privacy they may necessitate.
The threat to security in airports has become increasingly complex; as a result, the introduction of more invasive security protocols is to be expected. The modes of concealing weapons and explosives have evolved recently, as the man who unsuccessfully hid a bomb in his underwear showed, and the Transportation Security Administration needed to respond by adding levels of literal transparency to thwart terrorist attempts. These full-body scanners, at least momentarily, accomplish this goal while still maintaining traffic flow and avoiding rampant, invasive, full-body pat downs.
Although some people may feel uncomfortable with the new technology, most travelers should not be swayed by the “opt-out” campaign. For the majority of travelers, who are not opposed for a cultural or personal reason to outsiders seeing an image of their body, the scanners are not an egregious invasion of privacy. People’s faces are blurred, and the person seeing the image is in a remote location and is not the official watching travelers go through the scanner. A person in an entirely different location seeing an image of one’s body with no face attached is not a reason to massively slow down security and cause delays at the airport, as the campaign would presumably do.
Considering the increasing need for more “invasive” virtual measures, we appreciate the TSA’s continued consideration of the importance of keeping images of people anonymous and secure. In addition to the blurring of faces and remote viewing, the scanners are intended to be void of any measure for storing images after leaving test mode at the TSA test sites—although it appears that some images were inadvertently stored in the past. Still, the images will not be sent over a network, making them largely protected from hacking. These notable precautions, taken to prevent embarrassment through leakage of these images, should be seen as a display of the TSA’s consideration of people’s qualms about the machines. And the fact that the pat-down option exists for those whose religions or cultures preclude them from being scanned shows cultural sensitivity on the TSA’s part.
Moreover, we support the new scanners because they can be used to more thoroughly check most travelers instead of selectively subjecting people to additional security checks. This added fairness avoids racial profiling while performing a more complete and thorough check on everyone who goes through the security line.
These advanced imaging scanners are a natural improvement of airport security and should be welcomed as they become more prevalent in airports across the country. As security concerns heighten further, the TSA should continue to ensure security in airports and on planes while still bearing in mind cultural and personal sensitivities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Thursday, Harvard Facebook pages were abuzz with news of an anti-hipster protest in front of the Science Center. The protest was staged on the premise that hipsters tend not to vote, or, for that matter, do anything of value to society. With hipster culture on a wry upswing in young urban circles, it seems that most culturally conscious people have hostile opinions toward hipsters. Hipsters are fake, hipsters are self-indulgent, hipsters are hypocritical, hipsters smell bad; the criticisms range widely. But this notion that hipsters are a threat to American cultural life can be easily put to rest. Today’s hipsters make up a diffuse bloc that identifies in every imaginable direction, and hipsters have even been shown to be making positive contributions to mainstream culture.
To understand the hipster non-threat, it is important to understand just what the label means. In the 1990s, social commentators began to use the term to apply to the type of people who listen to independent music, ride fixed-gear bicycles, and eat organic foods. This early conception differs little from the 2010-era hipster, a much more culturally prominent being.
But something is amiss with this definition. What do independent music, bicycles, and organic food necessarily have to do with each other? Nothing necessarily. Scott G. Lief of Washington University in St. Louis, a sympathizer, explains that hipster culture “hasn’t created anything … [it] reappropriates meaning and significance from once-mainstream trends.”
A more evocative 2009 piece in Time gives a physical account: “take your grandmother’s sweater and Bob Dylan’s Wayfarers, add jean shorts, Converse All-Stars, and a can of Pabst and bam – hipster.” The average Harvard student might also mention Urban Outfitters and Vampire Weekend.
The mélange of different ideas and images in the hipster culture all point toward an obvious conclusion: Hipsters, whatever they are, do not share a concrete set of values or even have a well-defined membership group. According to Lief, the truest hipsters are supposed to be the ones who do their best not to self-identify at all.
In this sense, the hipster movement is arguably more a way of categorizing alternative trends than it is a cultural movement. There are no self-identified hipsters at the helm, and more importantly, there is no helm at the helm. It’s difficult to imagine that a diffuse quasi-movement whose identity is built more on ironically rebelling from the status quo could substantially change the order of American culture. Indeed, the majority of hipsters are not particularly bound to their behaviors by a hipster identity. Like most subcultures in American history, the hipster culture’s majority of subscribers are engaged mostly out of boredom and discontent with the mainstream.
But unlike other recent subcultures—emos, goths, punks, and Miley Cyrus fans—most hipsters have a weighty selection of other strong affiliations in mainstream society. They generally tend toward being political liberals, secular humanists, urbanites of a particular neighborhood, or students of a particular university. Few would deny that these identities are a lot more important than hipster, especially in a culture that discourages brazen pronouncements like “I am a hipster!”
Finally, hipster culture’s non-threat is best established by the fact that it has made some positive contributions to mainstream society. Whatever the reader personally feels about cardigans or bright-colored hoodies, they’ve swept youth fashion while at the same time loosening traditional taboos on which gender is supposed to wear what. Bands often associated with hipster culture have made a valuable contribution to the American music scene. With Vampire Weekend contributing African jams and educated lyrics and Ratatat redefining the role of electronics in music, hipster cultivation has enabled the kooky creativity of the independent music scene to reach the ears of national, even mainstream audiences.
So for all the talk of a hipster threat, however occasionally ironic, the case is reasonably clear that hipsters are not a menace to an American culture. Whatever one thinks of their aesthetic, they’re in no rush to overthrow the mainstream order; they need its existence to distinguish themselves. And let’s face it, if they’re not motivated enough to vote, how are they going to overthrow anything?
In the spirit of tolerance, turn down the Flo Rida and turn up the Animal Collective. And as painful as it might be, try for a day to put away the Brooks Brothers and instead throw on something just as expensive that looks like it’s been eaten. It’d be terribly ironic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My grandmother was nothing if not old-fashioned. Beyond her fondness for mothballs and ankle-length skirts, she maintained an endless archive of aphorisms from some pre-feminist, atemporal past—the stuff of Aesop and Grimm. These, she liked to extract at choice moments, most of which involved catching me in the midst of some transgression—mounting the refrigerator for forbidden Halloween candies, or combing my mother’s drawers for clip-on earrings. There was no misbehavior that could not be moralized with a three-letter, neatly alliterated phrase (“Mind your manners!”) and capped with some pithy comment on being a “lady,” or my inadequacy therein.
Manners, politeness, chivalry, “ladylikeness”: these, curmudgeons bemoan, are lost arts—ones that fell out of vogue around the same time that adolescents’ pants fell below their knees. Sarah Palin coins the term “mama grizzly”; Miley Cyrus pole dances; “Jersey Shore” gets renewed for a third season: Cultural apocalypse (else, implosion) is imminent—or so the conservative narrative goes. Most of us, myself included, greet these comments with more groan than nod: We, and our parents before us, have heard the prophesy before. Exposed bellybuttons and uncouth behavior fail to shock—and why should they? When we don’t like it, we just change the channel.
Applied to the internet, however, this lament assumes a decided valence. The internet has revolutionized modern life: Work, leisure, media, information, and even knowledge itself now bear scant resemblance to their pre-90’s form. Less noted, though no less important, is that the internet—alongside snail mail and printed books—has also revolutionized rudeness. With the World Wide Web, the number of ways that we can be petty, demeaning, and downright offensive to others—oftentimes, to people that we don’t even know—has multiplied million-fold. If my grandmother could work a computer, she would be scandalized.
Silence, at least according to ’60s pop-rock, can be golden. The internet—or, more aptly, a certain subculture of internet users—begs to differ. “Troll” is the tech vernacular for someone who virtually antagonizes others—generally in the form of comment feeds and messaging boards. Some of these “pranks” are innocuous and amusing. Others are emphatically not so. In 2006, Seattle-based programmer Jason Fortuny posted a fake ad on Craiglist as a woman seeking a “str8 brutal dom muscular male.” He proceeded to publish the names, pictures, and contact information of the hapless respondees on his blog. Two people lost their jobs; one lost his girlfriend.  In the wake of the Megan Meier MySpace suicide, Fortuny created a fake blog—this time, posing as Lori Drew, Meier’s online tormentor—where he penned hateful words about the recently deceased and her family. Its title: Megan Had It Coming.
Dubbed by The New York Times as “the closest thing this movement of anonymous provocateurs has to a spokesman,” Fortuny proves both an extreme example and an exception: In most cases, there is no face to match the affronts. Back in the day, you had to deliver your insults in person or, barring that, write a letter to the editor, complete with a verifiable name and address. Even if printed anonymously, identities were vetted by the publisher, who assumed responsibility, legal et al, for the printed words. In the world of internet trolls, however, anonymity is king: It guarantees the ability to say almost anything sans consequence. The amorphous state of internet defamation law—much looser than its print counterpart—exacerbates the problem.
Fortuny and company, of course, are a selective lot: Not all those who weigh-in are of the “if you don’t have something nice to say, say it anyways—and loudly” persuasion. Online commenting, on the whole, is a positive force: One that enables audience engagement and fosters journalistic integrity. Yet, what absolute anonymity contributes to this scheme remains less certain. Barring some cogent reason—a fear of persecution (personal, political or otherwise) or extreme emotional sensitivity to the topic at hand—if you can’t stand behind your written words, why write them at all?
News sites, which initially embraced the digital free-for-all in hopes of boosting page hits, are now rethinking the merits of unfettered anonymity. The New York Times requires aspiring pundits to register before opining; a staffer, in turn, reviews each comment, vetoing those that indulge in bigotry and ad hominem attacks. The Wall Street Journal displays the full name of the commenter (ascertained through an online registration process) before each quip. While many digital news outlets have neither the money nor the manpower for such meticulous undertakings, almost all, including The Crimson, allow “flagging.” In this mode, readers police the conversation themselves, marking retorts in particularly poor taste for editor attention. The latter, however, fails to prevent baseless—even cruel—attacks from going live in the first place.
Like it or not, the internet has transformed us all into online selves. Facebook and Twitter enable us to perform our identities as much as express them, while Google searches are now standard procedure for employers and would-be love-interests. As our emotional and existential stakes in the web have risen, so too have the damages that digital malevolence can wreak. Anonymity may facilitate gratuitous hostility, but it does not—and cannot—justify it.

Art has reached its final destination and is now meaningless. Modernism’s reaction to prior aesthetic standards liberated artists to push the boundaries of art. But these boundaries have been expanded to the point of obliteration. As Leon Battista Alberti would tell us in “On Painting,” art used to be an attempt to reflect the harmony within the natural world. Alberti writes that “painting contributes to the most honorable delights of the soul and to the dignified beauty of things.” In the modern era, as Francis Bacon put it, “painting has now become, or all art has now become completely a game, by which man distracts himself.” It’s certainly a strange distraction that Bacon paints, as the blurred face of a man peers out from a lacerated bloody carcass. This progression from Peter Paul Rubens’ “Garden of Love” to Andres Serrano’s “Piss Christ” is not only an aesthetic one but also a conceptual one.
Ever since Marcel Duchamp famously submitted a men’s urinal to an art exhibition in 1917, the idea of what constitutes a work of art has been lost. If we believe the postmodern conventionalist critique of art, almost everything can be considered an artistic expression. As Harold Rosenberg elucidated, if household objects can count as art by virtue of their location in a museum, then geographical place is the driving determinant of art. At this point, when Joseph Beuys’ suit gains the status of art because the hanger is hung on a different hook in a fancier building, art is in trouble. More specifically, art loses all of its meaning, since the realm of artistic expression no longer has standards that define its own limits.
Bacon was half right. In an era that gives us a crucifix placed in urine, a bright-eyed masturbating cowboy, a naked woman hugging a dead pig, and an exhibition of possible animal torture, art is a shell game. Shock value has replaced technical skill, pornography has been substituted for anatomical accuracy, and offense has replaced a desire for that which resonates with the human soul. Art used to be prized for its ability to raise the human spirit, but now all it does is raise controversy. Art is an enterprise marked by frenzied disturbance. If you are looking for meaning, all you’ll find is smoke and mirrors. Whichever shell you pick in the modernist game, there’s no reward to be discovered.
But, the inclusion of this hysterical display of repugnance into the legitimate boundaries of artistic expression comes at a high cost. A work of art can be produced by anyone without technical skill, appreciation of art, or desire for coherence. The discipline of art has died with its definition. As a type of artistic relativism ascended, the basis upon which viewers could value Michelangelo’s “Pietà” above Chris Ofili’s similar subject accompanied by elephant dung was lost to the orthodoxy that all is art.
There are myriad ways to be offensive and perhaps an equal number of ways to be useless. I too can hang my polos and khakis in the Sackler, but that doesn’t make me an artist, a visionary, or even mildly talented. For those who seek to manufacture offense, the ease with which this goal is now achieved in the modern world speaks less to the world’s overly sensitive viewpoint and more to the lack of audacity in the artistic world. It’s no longer brave to disturb others who still hold to the sacred. In a realm of ideas in which all offenses are permitted, the last frontier is the type and magnitude of the violation. The real creative spirit has been lost, and a desire to validate all transgressions by placing them in the realm of artistic expression is all that’s left. Bravery comes from having an ideal to defend, not an indiscriminate wish to desecrate.
Some still hold to the controversial position that some attempts at artistic expression are not of value, even if displayed at The Museum of Modern Art. The possible accusation of being resistant to change is ultimately worth the risk. In taking this judgmental step, the limits of art can be preserved, and a sense of beauty can be reclaimed.

One of Harvard’s oldest clubs is now back and fully loaded. The Harvard Shooting Club, the only University-sanctioned group that utilizes handguns, pistols, and shotguns, has recently been named an official club sport team. Originally formed in 1883, HSC was disbanded in 2003 because of a lack of student involvement. In October 2009, a group of students went on a shotgun trap outing with the Harvard Law School and became so enthused about the sport that they decided to revive the organization.
The club immediately began organizing group outings, target practices, and open classes, which were wildly popular on campus. Within two days, 140 campus gun enthusiasts had signed up for their course “Handguns 101.” With so much student interest, the club leadership decided that the time was ripe to apply for a status upgrade to an official club sport. 
But to gain this kind of recognition, they had to bring out the big guns. 
“We had to go through a lot of bureaucratic red tape and restrictions,” said team co-captain Tian Wang ’12, referencing the safety concerns, liability issues, and financial logistics that they had to address. “We applied in February and weren’t approved until September.” Currently, there are 50 students who count shooting shotguns as one of their activities at Harvard, and in the past two years, the team has raised over $13,000 in funding, primarily from the National Shooting Sports Foundation. 
“There’s a marked difference between a team and a club,” said team member Lila E. Nieves-Wang ’13, who has been shooting since she was 6 years old. “I love the new team vibe. It brings people in and they’re much more committed.” The team practices trap and skeet shooting with shotguns off-campus, and hopes to begin target shooting with pistols and rifles in the spring. 
“It’s been a very satisfying experience,” said Wang. “I don’t think there’s anyone who’s tried it and been like ‘ehh.’ Everyone loves it.” The team is still planning on giving open classes and holding paintball competitions. Newcomers are welcome, so anyone is welcome to ride shotgun in this learning process.

The fate of the Globe Corner Bookstore is once again in doubt. The owner of the longtime Harvard Square travel bookshop­—which reopened on the corner of Mount Auburn and JFK streets in 2006—says he’s putting his store up for sale amid health concerns. The possible sale makes the Globe Corner the latest Square business to confront an uncertain future­­—and at least the second local bookstore in as many years to be put up for sale. The Globe Corner’s owner, Patrick Carrier, said the sale was prompted by personal health concerns­—a seizure disorder that, he said, “is likely to be very manageable over time” but was the impetus for him to seek to leave the business. Carrier said he is already responding to inquiries from potential buyers and expressed hope that a sale wouldn’t change the shop’s character. “It would be our hope that we would sell the store in its current incarnation,” Carrier said. “We would certainly be open to offers that involve some other form of bookselling.”  Carrier’s announcement left the Square’s business community concerned and saddened. “We understand that the store is going to be sold because Pat is not feeling well, which concerns us more than the store’s sale,”  said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association.  The rocky economy has contributed to a shake-up in the Square’s commercial makeup. Since early 2009, retailers and eateries including Adidas, Z Square, and Herrell’s Ice Cream have left the area. The Globe Corner could become at least the second Square bookstore to change owners in recent years. The Harvard Bookstore was sold in 2008 to a Wellesley couple. “We would hope that Globe Corner would stay in its location, in much the same way that the Harvard Bookstore was able to transition under new ownership,” Jillson said. The potential sale marks a new chapter in the Globe Corner’s history. In July 2005, the Globe Corner, then located on the corner of Church and Palmer streets, closed its doors because it couldn’t afford to renew its lease. It reopened the following year at 90 Mt. Auburn St., the building the store still occupies today.  “It has been an immensely rewarding 28 years for me at The Globe Corner,” Carrier said in a statement. “It has been a privilege to work with such wonderful staff, customers, friends in the book and publishing industry, and of course the great books and maps.”

Students, department chairs, and other Harvard affiliates expressed outrage yesterday over a former Colombian president’s appearance here this week—even as Harvard insisted that Álvaro Uribe Vélez’s visit was in keeping with the University’s mission.
In a tersely worded letter sent to the University president and the Harvard Kennedy School dean yesterday, 42 Harvard affiliates protested Uribe’s appearance on Wednesday at a meeting hosted by the Kennedy School’s Center for International Development.
Uribe served as president of Colombia from 2002 to 2010. During his tenure, Uribe’s military repeatedly battled an insurgent peasant army called the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
“Mr. Uribe’s government has been shrouded in corruption scandals and diverse incidents of human rights violations that have affected the institutional and democratic order of the nation and its citizens in profound ways,” said the letter, which was co-drafted by María Ospina, a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. “We strongly reject Mr. Uribe’s presence at Harvard University as a privileged guest of a center that values democracy, good governance, and justice.”
Ospina argued that inviting Uribe to the Kennedy School is an endorsement of his tenure as president. Colombian officials are investigating Uribe for actions related to possible human rights violations, corruption, obstruction of justice, and espionage.
“We wanted to voice our protest and show our frustration at this invitation,” Ospina said.
But the Kennedy School, which also hosted Uribe in Sept. 2009 and garnered similar disapproval at the time, argued that Uribe’s visit—which included a Q-and-A session with about 40 students—was appropriate.
“One of the fundamental tenets of the Kennedy School and all American universities is a free exchange of ideas,” Kennedy School spokeswoman Melodie Jackson said in a statement. “In keeping with that educational mission, the Kennedy School has a long tradition of providing an opportunity for leaders from around the world to speak to and interact with the community on important public policy issues.”
The letter, addressed to University President Drew G. Faust, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75, and Kennedy School Professor Ricardo Hausmann, outlined ethical issues that have “tainted” Uribe’s legacy. It also mentioned 2010-2011 Nieman Fellow and Colombian journalist Hollman Morris Rincon, who was initially denied a visa this summer to study in the United States. Uribe’s successor, current Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, was also a Nieman fellow in 1988.

A student comedy group is under fire after releasing a parody video that refers to the murder last year of a Yale graduate student.
The video, made by comedy group On Harvard Time, spoofs a much-viewed Yale admissions video that zoomed across the Internet earlier this year. In the On Harvard Time version, a prospective student asks a Yale admissions officer, “What happened to the girl that was murdered and stuffed in the wall?” The admissions officer brushes off the question.
The question is a reference to the murder of Yale graduate student Annie Le, who was found in the basement wall of a medical research building last September—a crime that drew national media attention.
On Harvard Time said the video was not meant to be offensive, but the group replaced the video on Wednesday with a new version, in which the line about the murdered girl has been removed.
“The humor rested in the flossing over of significant event, and not in the event itself,” the group said. “The line was not meant to make light of the incident or those involved but rather to mock the university.”
But On Harvard Time’s video ignited a firestorm of criticism, both at Yale and in the national media. The New York Post said the video showed “heartless Harvard undergrads” practicing “a failed attempt at humor.” A Yale Daily News editorial said the video’s authors “exhibited a gross insensitivity.”
Yale senior Zachary Fuhrer said he found the comment to be a “low blow.”
“There are so many things you can rip off with regards to Yale,” Fuhrer said. “The Annie Le joke was just like, ‘Come on...Get real.’”
At Harvard, the video prompted mixed reactions.
“I thought it was really gross,” said Edirin E. Sido ’14. “Why would you parody something so serious and not even a Harvard-Yale issue. It’s someone’s personal life and they were murdered.”
On the other hand, Christopher K. Lee ’13 insisted the video wasn’t insensitive but, in fact, the best that On Harvard Time had put out.
“Given that you already have the Yale video, and how it came out, I thought it was very appropriate,” Lee said.
The Yale video that was spoofed, “That’s Why I Chose Yale,” was a collaboration between Yale undergraduates and recent alumni working in the admissions office. The video shows what appears to be a standard information session that turns into an over-the-top musical about what Yale has to offer.

The Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize Committee Thorbjørn Jagland told a crowd of undergraduates, faculty members, and distinguished guests to remain vigilant in defense of human rights throughout the world last night at a dinner co-sponsored by the Harvard Foundation and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Jagland, who was presented with the 2010 Peter J. Gomes Humanitarian Award for his work supporting efforts to uphold human rights and civil rights, urged the audience to be curious, to keep an open mind, and not to be indifferent to the repression of human rights in order to preserve them.
“You have to see that something is bigger than yourself, something which you can struggle for,” he said.
Jagland, who has served at the helm of the Nobel Peace Prize Committee since 2009, said that people who win the Peace Prize exemplify these tenets.
He said that U.S. President Barack Obama was given the award last year for reaching out to the Muslim world, working with the Russians on disarmament, and attempting to broker peace negotiations among Israelis and Palestinians.
Jagland said his commitment to maintaining human and civil rights was inspired by the American Civil Rights Movement.
“It is the movement that has influenced the world the most,” he said. “It proved that it was possible to achieve human rights through democratic means.”
Director of the Harvard Foundation S. Allen Counter and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Professor Peter J. Gomes presented the Humanitarian award to Jagland to “honor his notable contribution to humanitarianism in the cause of peace.”
The humanitarian award is given to an individual whose works on behalf of humanity deserve special recognition.
“[The Nobel Peace Prize Committee] makes an effort to take a position on the international stage for peace, human rights, and civil rights,” Counter said. “[Jagland] has been the leader of that effort to recognize and support individuals who are at the forefront of the struggle for human rights and civil rights.”
Omer Aftab ’11, an applied math concentrator from Leverett House, said he enjoyed Jagland’s remarks.
“[Not to be indifferent] is a message that I wouldn’t mind being reminded of often,” he said.  “Especially at a place where 50 percent of the graduates go into i-banking, people need to know where they are going.”

Mohamed Olad Hassan, a Somali journalist who has covered the people of his nation amid dangerous insurgency over the last decade, was awarded the Louis M. Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism at the Walter Lippmann House in Cambridge last night.
Hassan, a senior correspondent and writer for BBC World Service and The Associated Press, has been called the “voice of the voiceless.”
While many media professionals have been killed on the job in Somalia and many others have fled, Hassan has remained despite efforts by the government and insurgent groups to silence the media.
“Being a reporter in Somalia is a matter of death and life. There’s always danger. Self-censorship is an important part. You don’t know who your enemy is,” said Hassan who wore a light blue suit inspired by the Somali flag.
The Lyons award is presented to an individual, group or institution involved in communication that displays conscience and integrity.
Each year, the class of journalists selected for fellowships by Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism chooses whether to present the award. The Nieman Fellow class of 2011 had several meetings throughout September and October discussing candidates, who came from seven countries.
They narrowed the selection to three finalists, including Claudia J. Duque, a journalist covering human rights issues in Colombia, Ahman Zeidabadi, an Iranian journalist who has faced multiple arrests, and Hassan. Hassan won in a runoff vote.
“We see many journalists as ‘Indiana Joneses,’ who travel to foreign nations to report. This award recognizes Mohamed as a reporter who has worked domestically and is a true hero,” said Gwen Thompkins, a member of the Nieman Fellows class of 2011 who nominated Hassan.
Hassan said he wanted to be a journalist since his childhood. He started his career writing for the Xog-Ogaal newspaper in Mogadishu in 2001 and became Somali Television Network’s chief Mogadishu correspondent in 2002. The next year, he began reporting for the BBC and The Associated Press.
“Journalists in Somalia must be courageous. It’s not a business, but a dangerous job,” Hassan said.
James M. Fallows ’70, a national correspondent for The Atlantic and a former president of The Crimson, was the keynote speaker.
“I knew of [Hassan’s] reporting and have seen many journalists take physical hardships. It’s important for the Western world to recognize them.”

As the lyrics of Queen’s “We Are The Champions” rang through the common room of a Quincy suite, Undergraduate Council president-elect Senan Ebrahim ’12 and running mate Bonnie Cao ’12 celebrated their victory in this year’s UC elections.
“I haven’t cried since I was like nine or something, but it’s gonna happen right now,” Ebrahim said in a speech to the room of friends and campaign staffers. “I’ve been sick today. Nothing speeds up a recovery like a victory like this.”
Minutes earlier, a knock on the door had brought the party in the room to a halt, as Ebrahim opened the door to reveal members of the Election Commission, UC leaders, and the Harvard Glee Club. After Election Commission Chair Cort S. VanOstran ’12 announced their victory, the candidates embraced, popped a bottle of apple cider, and prepared for the traditional serenade by the Glee Club.
Ebrahim expressed his readiness to begin the work of leading the Council. He said that he had already scheduled a meeting with administrators about advising issues for this morning.
Ebrahim also stressed that he plans to maintain the momentum of the campaign and the past year by focusing on Council culture—promising to make his first piece of legislation the “Johnny Bowman Chill Act,” in honor of current UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
“I’d say the main thing we want to do is keep the positive energy surrounding our campaign about the UC up,” Ebrahim said. “We need to make sure the UC stays chill.”
COMEDY CENTRAL
Around 8:30 p.m., supporters of UC presidential candidate Collin A. Jones ’12 and vice presidential candidate Peter D. Davis ’12 gathered in front of University Hall for the College Events Board’s pep rally for this weekend’s Harvard-Yale football game.
Davis, an amateur comedian and member of the Harvard College Stand-Up Comics Society, performed a comedy set at the beginning of the pep assembly and proceeded to act as Master of Ceremonies throughout the event.
After visiting the Ebrahim-Cao gathering, members of the Election Commission informed the two losing tickets of the results by telephone. Later in the night, both of the defeated tickets stopped by their opponents’ victory party.
“We congratulate Senan and Bonnie for a well-run campaign,” said Tengbo Li ’12, who was running for vice president on a ticket with Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12. “We were up against a tough opponent.”
Despite noting that their loss in the UC election was “a shocker for both of us,” Jones appeared relatively unfazed as election results became available.
“We congratulate Senan and Bonnie,” he said. “We feel confident that Ebrahim-Cao will be able to uphold the principles of democracy, safety, and bringing Harvard into the 21st century.”
Ebrahim indicated last night that he planned to begin delivering on that agenda by offering Jones the position of Executive Democratic Chair of Safety.
“Collin Jones can expect a senior position in our administration,” Ebrahim said.
UNDERSTATED AFFAIR
Coe-Odess and Li, who came in second in the presidential race, congregated in Coe-Odess’ neighbor’s room in Kirkland House with seven friends while awaiting the results. The tone of the Coe-Li party remained casual and intimate despite the significance of the occasion.
“It’s the biggest endeavor I’ve undertaken. I’m proud I put in the time and effort. I’m also proud of all the help and support we got,” Coe said. “I think the stronger ticket won, and we’re holding our heads high.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week University President Drew G. Faust made her strongest overture yet to the possibility that the Reserve Officer Training Corps might return to Harvard if the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy ends as expected. But despite her recent remarks, the unit’s return to campus remains highly uncertain due to low levels of enrollment, limited Pentagon funding, and logistical hurdles.
Chief among the obstacles is the small size of the corps at Harvard. The number of students enrolled in ROTC would likely have to increase to justify the installation of a campus unit, said Retired Captain Paul E. Mawn ’63, chairman of the Advocates for Harvard ROTC.
The University would have to expand its military science and course  offerings and may have to hire additional faculty but would not have to  grant Harvard credit for those courses. Cadets currently take most of  their classes at MIT for no Harvard credit.
Faust raised the prospect of ROTC’s return in remarks earlier this week when she said that “a ROTC program open to all ought to be fully and formally present on our campus.”
If ROTC were officially recognized, it would reduce the administrative hurdles that cadets currently have to navigate and would mark an important symbolic gesture toward the military, Faust said in an interview yesterday. Exactly how the University would structure the program is something that would need to be worked out with the military, she said.
“I think what’s important is that we signal that ROTC and service in the military is something we want to be available to all our students,” she added. “We don’t want to raise any additional hurdles for them by making it inconvenient and a choice that is scrutinized.”
The military currently does not allow gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military under the policy known as “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,”  which the University considers a violation of its anti-discrimination policy.
Admiral Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said earlier this week in a speech at the Institute of Politics that he would do everything within his power to see an ROTC unit established at Harvard.
Captain John F. Kirby, a spokesman for the admiral, said yesterday that Mullen “is willing to lend both his influence and his leadership to the effort of exploring a greater ROTC presence across the country, but particularly in those places where we are under-represented demographically.”
“Harvard, a superb institution rich in military tradition and located in a part of the country from which we do not recruit a great majority of people, certainly qualifies as a place we’d like to see a unit established,” Kirby continued.
But Mawn said that because of budgetary constraints, the Pentagon may not be eager to add ROTC campuses in the future.
In order to attract a critical mass of students to ROTC, the school would need to take a proactive approach to recruit prospective ROTC applicants and to encourage students to pursue military opportunities, Mawn said. The University would also need to rethink its admissions priorities to attract more students interested in ROTC, he added.
“I welcome what she says. I think she’s earnest. But it’s not just one issue,” Mawn said, referring to Faust’s public comments on ROTC, which came as she introduced Mullen. “Certain factions in [the Faculty of Arts and Sciences] will come up with half a dozen other reasons not to encourage ROTC to return.”
Harvard ROTC cadets currently drill and attend classes at MIT along with students from a number of other local colleges. Cadets and midshipmen have said in the past that the lack of formal recognition by the University has contributed to a sense of marginalization on campus.
In an interview yesterday, Faust said that she thinks the Faculty’s concern about the military, which contributed to ROTC’s departure in 1969, has largely dissipated. She added that she believes the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” would smooth over lingering opposition to the military’s presence on campus.
But even that piece may take time. The near-term prospects for the measure’s repeal have diminished in recent weeks after the Republican takeover of the House and deep Democratic losses in the Senate.

Michael W. McLean ’12 won an uncontested race for the Harvard Republican Club presidency last night after Luis A. Martinez ’12 pulled out of the contest while denying accusations that he forged an e-mail from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company to Harvard students.
Martinez said that McLean confronted him in Winthrop Dining Hall on Monday night, alleging that he was responsible for sending the e-mail (see here for text). The message, which The Crimson obtained yesterday, invited recipients—including several members of the HRC—to a selective McKinsey recruiting event at MIT, which was to take place at the same time as the HRC elections last night.
McLean mentioned Internet Protocol addresses, which can serve as online identifiers, as evidence of Martinez’s involvement, according to Martinez.
Martinez denied the charges in an interview with The Crimson and said that he dropped out of the race following his encounter with McLean to avoid what he perceived to be an increasingly negative campaign.
“There are definitely other elements, but quite frankly this is the most recent and most damning accusation,” Martinez said of the e-mail allegations. “This isn’t necessarily the kind of thing I want to involve myself with.”
McLean and other members of the HRC declined to comment on the allegations, pointing to an ongoing disciplinary inquiry by the College that was initiated when McLean brought the concern about the McKinsey e-mail to the administration. McLean did say that he disagreed with Martinez’s claim that the campaigning had become negative.
Both the Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison and FAS IT have declined to comment on the case.
Several Harvard undergraduates, including several members of the HRC, received an e-mail from alexjmichaelson@gmail.com on Saturday night, inviting them to a “private reception” at MIT on Thursday at 8 p.m. The message was signed “Alex J. Michaelson, McKinsey & Company.”
The e-mail also mentioned the opportunity to sign up for “one of 25 exclusive fast-track interview slots, available only to those who attend our event.”
McKinsey spokeswoman Yolande Daeninck confirmed that an e-mail from an individual purporting to be a McKinsey representative was sent to Harvard undergraduates, inviting them to an exclusive recruiting event at MIT.
“As soon as we found out about it, we immediately worked closely with the Office of Career Services to contact the students who had received the e-mail and try to identify the sender,” Daeninck wrote in an e-mail statement.
On Monday, Deb Carroll, OCS’ assistant director of On-Campus Interview & Employer Relations Office, sent an e-mail to students registered for OCS’ on-campus recruiting alerting them of the fraudulent McKinsey e-mail.
While there was a recruiting event at MIT yesterday, it was a general recruiting session for MIT students, Carroll wrote.
“We didn’t want students to be confused or go somewhere where a program wasn’t happening,” said Robin Mount, the director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities, an umbrella organization encompassing OCS. Mount declined to comment further on the e-mail.
IP addresses, which Martinez said were cited as evidence against him, can be used to identify specific computers from which an e-mail message originated, according to Jeremy S. Cushman ’12, a board member of the Harvard Computing Society.
But Cushman added that IP addresses are not “conclusive” in identifying a specific sender. For example, messages sent by two different people might show the same IP address if they used the same computer. In addition, messages sent from the Gmail web client usually show the IP address of the website’s servers rather than the unique IP address of the sender, he wrote.

Many Americans living with diabetes, heart disease, or cancer believe their health has been or will be harmed by the economic downturn, a new poll from the Harvard School of Public Health shows.
Almost half of the more than 1,000 people with heart disease and diabetes surveyed said the difficult economic climate has made managing their illnesses more stressful, while more than 35 percent of them believe the poor economy has negatively impacted their health, according to the poll.
The economic downturn has left many chronically ill people in financial trouble, causing them to use up almost all of their life savings, go into credit card debt, neglect non-health bills, or even declare bankruptcy, according to the survey results. Diabetes, heart disease, and cancer often require ongoing, costly treatment.
“We wanted to give a voice to these people living with chronic illnesses,” said Gillian K. SteelFisher, assistant director at the public-health school’s Harvard Opinion Research Program, which conducted the poll along with research company Knowledge Networks. “The fact is, the economic downturn has had a really bad impact on their health, which is important when we think about public health overall.”
Of those surveyed, just under half said they believed their current financial problems would continue to harm them in the future.
“We’re not just looking at bankruptcy,” SteelFisher said, “but a wider set of measures. They suggest that people are vulnerable to these significant financial stresses.”

Additional police officers hired in response to a robbery outside  Thayer Hall last Thursday will continue to patrol the Yard this weekend,  according to a Harvard University Police Department spokesman.
The confirmation comes on the heels of two additional robberies  committed near campus after the Thayer incident. In total, at least  eight robberies have been committed on or near campus since Oct. 30.
The latest robbery took place early Wednesday morning near the  Harvard Square T stop, where three unarmed suspects—one of whom was  apprehended later the same day—demanded that a Boston resident hand over  his cell phone and money.
HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano did not give further details about  the reasoning behind police staffing levels and declined to comment  about specific security measures being taken during the upcoming  Harvard-Yale weekend, citing a “longstanding policy of not discussing  staffing levels or security measures.”
In  response to a question about the petition started last Friday in response to the Yard robbery, Catalano wrote in an e-mail  last night that there will be no identity checks required to enter the  Yard this weekend or in the near future.
“As with any security measure, we work with University officials to  determine if the plan would be effective while striking the proper  balance between security and the freedom of movement,” Catalano added.
Of the eight incidents in recent weeks, three involved Harvard  affiliates and six included armed assailants. Two victims—one a Harvard  affiliate—were harmed non-lethally.
Two robberies took place on campus—in addition to the Yard robbery,  the Harvard University Employee Credit Union was quietly robbed by an  unarmed white male on Oct. 30.
The other six robberies all occurred within one block of Harvard  property, stretching from the Quad to the Divinity School. Two of them  were very close to the Harvard Square T stop.
Three of the eight robberies are believed to be committed by the same  two people, who are also suspected to be related to a series of  robberies in MIT last month. Cambridge police arrested one of the two  suspects on Nov. 3 and “have solid leads that our investigators are  following” to apprehend the other one, according to Cambridge Police  Department spokesman Daniel M. Riviello.
HUPD and the Cambridge Police Department had arrested at least three  suspects related to the other five robberies as of yesterday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College is reevaluating its three-year-old decision to eliminate early admissions, Harvard’s top admissions official acknowledged yesterday.
In an interview with The Crimson, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 praised the outcome of Harvard’s single admissions cycle over the past three years but said that an extensive review of the admissions procedure is underway and will conclude in a few months.
“We’re in the midst of a major study,” Fitzsimmons said. “At the moment, we don’t anticipate any changes, but we’re a dynamic institution.”
Fitzsimmons’ comments came in response to an announcement by the University of Virginia that it plans to offer a new Early Action option to students applying next year.
In Sept. 2006, Harvard announced that it would no longer offer its Early Action program, which allowed high-school seniors to receive an admissions decision in December but did not mandate that they attend if accepted. Within the month, Princeton and Virginia followed suit, cancelling their Early Decision programs, which had similar timing but bound accepted students to attend, in favor of a single admissions notification date.
The three schools have jointly conducted 18-city recruiting tours since the announcement of the decision, and some officials acknowledged at the time that they hoped other top universities would follow suit in eliminating early admissions programs.
All three schools said at the time that early admissions programs were unfavorable to less affluent students, who sometimes forgo the programs in order to apply to many universities during the regular decision cycle and compare financial aid offers from different schools.
Virginia Dean of Admission Gregory W. Roberts said yesterday that the elimination of Early Decision has indeed increased diversity at his university.
“Socioeconomically and racially, the enrolling classes for the past three years have been significantly more diverse,” Roberts said. But he added that the school’s new Early Action program—which allows applicants to apply to other schools’ early admissions programs concurrently and does not compel them to attend Virginia if admitted—will not discourage underprivileged students from applying.
“From a university institutional self-interest perspective, we felt like there were students we were missing who were interested in applying and receiving early notification,” Roberts said. “We felt like we will be able to enroll the same type of class...and also respond to student interest.”
Fitzsimmons said that Harvard has been reviewing the success of its single application cycle every year. This year, he said, a particularly in-depth review is underway. Fitzsimmons said the study will conclude in time for application materials for next year’s admissions season to be printed.
Marlene A. Rubin, a college access counselor at a public magnet high school in Texas, said she thought several students at her school would apply early to Harvard if the option existed.
“I think Harvard and Princeton are always going to get applicants no matter what they offer,” Rubin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, and former DC Public Schools Chancellor Michelle Rhee called for scalable solutions to reform the public education system last night in a discussion moderated by a former U.S. Secretary of Education at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics.
The discussion marked the end of Bush’s week as a Visiting Fellow at the IOP.
During the panel, Bush, Rhee, and Podesta emphasized that reformers should focus on teacher effectiveness and targeting resources in a more effective way because they will have wide-ranging impacts that will lead to sustainable improvements in student achievement. Rhee said that teachers unions were an impediment to attracting and retaining effective teachers.
“We need to begin to differentiate. We have to be able to say that they’re not so good...for kids,” said Rhee, who brokered a contract to compensate effective teachers with more pay. “Now, if you tell a teacher they’re not doing a good job, it’s like you’re attacking the entire profession.”
Rhee said teachers unions’ philosophy, which is that all teachers should be treated—and paid—equally, made it difficult to reward effective teachers and fire ineffective ones.
Citing “Jeb’s Way,” Bush, the governor of Florida from 1999-2007, argued that it is possible to separate teachers from labor organizations, and that was one of the ways he facilitated education reform in Florida.
Another possibility for hiring effective teachers is to “blow the whole thing up in terms of the teacher certification system,” Bush said. “Bring in teachers who have great competency in the subject matter, and teach them how to teach it.”
Bush also addressed the issue of funding in schools.
Bush said principals should be given full control of the budget and be allowed to hire the teachers they want to, regardless of their seniority.
He also said that to create education reform across the country, reform needs to be scalable. He said that one-time donations, such as the $100 million gift from Mark Zuckerberg to Newark’s public schools will not lead to true reform because it cannot spread across the country.
“We get to scalability if we get closer to what the average student funding is,” Bush said.
Since Monday, Bush—the brother of President of George W. Bush and the son of President George H.W. Bush—has talked to students in various student groups, including the Harvard Republican Club. He also attended Professor Roger Porter’s class, “Government 1540: The American Presidency,” on Tuesday and taught the class yesterday. When asked in an interview with The Crimson whether Bush would be running for president, he responded, “I don’t have any plans to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, Undergraduate Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 noted the relatively equal footing of the two leading tickets in this year’s elections.
Both presidential candidates and their running mates had served time on the UC’s 12-person executive board, both ran on social life as a key issue, and both counted their experience as a key asset.
But in 11 days of campaigning and elections, the winning ticket of Senan Ebrahim ’12 and running mate Bonnie Cao ’12 opened up a noticable gap on challengers Matthew S. Coe-Odess ’12 and Tengbo Li ’12, setting the pace in endorsements by student groups and support from fellow UC representatives.
While Coe-Odess and Li emphasized their ticket’s attractiveness to individual students from a wide variety of backgrounds, Ebrahim and Cao were able to garner 24 student group endorsements, compared to only six for their opponents.
In an interview with The Crimson earlier this week, Cao identified the student group endorsements as particularly crucial in this year’s race, which centered on finding options for increasing and facilitating social options. Both campaigns boasted planks intended to help groups gain access to alternative spaces and funding for large events.
Ebrahim and Cao campaign insiders pointed to the ticket’s realistic platform, many elements of which had already been pursued by the pair during their time on the Council, as a reason for its endorsement success.
Harvard College Democrats President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 agreed, saying that the Ebrahim-Cao ticket’s focus on feasible solutions to the problems of social space and funding for student groups won it the group’s endorsement.
“Social space is something that student groups have been dealing with for years. This isn’t the first campaign in which all candidates have addressed it,” said Ashlee N. Adams ’12, president of the Black Students Association, which endorsed Ebrahim-Cao. “A lot of the tickets addressed social space and TFs in sections. Senan and Bonnie seemed to have a plan as to how they were actually going to achieve those goals.”
While senior leaders on the Council’s Executive Board stayed publicly neutral, Ebrahim and Cao won the support of eight of 12 freshman representatives, giving them increased access and exposure to voters in the Yard. Explaining why he chose to support the Ebrahim-Cao ticket, Oak Yard representative William F. Poff-Webster ’14 pointed to the pair’s prominent accomplishments on the Council over the past months.
In contrast, Coe-Odess and Li emphasized their outreach to students as individuals, which included knocking on 600 doors while forming their platform.
“I think the best thing was that Matt and Tengbo spent a lot of time just talking to students—door knocking, just walking around,” said Beñat A. Idoyaga ’12, the pair’s campaign manager.
Nevertheless, the inability to tap the larger networks represented by student groups and Yard constituencies may have slowed the ticket’s momentum. Coe-Odess said that his campaign may have appealed to a different demographic of students than those who typically turn out in UC election campaigns.
Coe said yesterday that he believed he had received the votes of “99 percent of athletes, 99 percent of final club members” and that the ticket had in fact fielded ideas that were advantageous for other student demographics, including freshmen, but that ultimately the pair lacked connections to the networks of students who perennially turn out for UC elections.
“[Senan and Bonnie’s] crowd is the kind of people who are generally interested in this stuff and care about this,” Coe-Odess added. “My crowd is indifferent, but they voted for me.”

After missing only one Harvard-Yale football game in the last 65 years, Paul I. Lee ’46 will be recognized tomorrow with a prize that is the exclusive preserve of the University’s most loyal fans—the so-called Little Red Flag.
Lee, who went to his first Harvard-Yale game as a sixth-grader in 1935, and has been absent for only one of the storied showdowns since the end of World War II, is set to become not just a decorated fan but a standard-bearer for a revived tradition when he receives the flag before kickoff.
Between 1950 and 2000, the Flag was passed between the fans who had attended the most Harvard-Yale football games. But 10 years ago, the Varsity Club changed the tradition and it was instead occasionally presented to a “superfan”—a particularly devoted alum whose engagement with the school extended beyond football.
Last year, Spencer Ervin ’54 sent a letter to Harvard Magazine in hopes of putting the Flag back in the hands of the most regular fan. Among those involved was Jeffrey P. Lee ’74, Paul Lee’s son, who put Ervin in touch with his father.
Lee said that he and his father were piqued that devotion to Harvard Athletics would be judged on criteria other than attendance. With the help of other alums, the group made arrangements to produce a replica Flag that could be presented to a long-time attendee.
Jeffrey Lee—who himself has seen every Harvard-Yale game since 1960—said that his father has retained a passion for Harvard athletics throughout his adult life, and that for years, Paul, a Woodstock, Conn. resident, attended every Harvard football game, both at home and on the road.
It’s very nice,” said the elder Lee of his recognition. “I knew two of the fellows who had it before...It was disappointing to see that the flag was not going where it should have gone, and the fact that it has been revived is rather satisfying.”
According to his son, Lee’s attendance figures are a pure indication of his commitment to the sport of football. Unlike many of the students today, he said, Paul Lee partakes in the social scene minimally.
“I don’t even know if he knows people drink liquor at the Game,” Jeffrey Lee said.
Before 2000, the Little Red Flag had nine different owners. The tradition began with Frederick Plummer, class of 1888, who attended the Harvard-Yale game 59 times between 1884 and his death in 1948. According to the Harvard Magazine, an editor of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin suggested that it be passed down to the longest-attending fan of the Game.
Still, both Ervin and Jeffrey Lee emphasized that the recognition is informal and of little real importance.
“It’s the kind of quaint custom that’s fun just because it’s meaningless,” Ervin said. “It’s not any matter of great significance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After missing only one Harvard-Yale football game in the last 65 years, Paul I. Lee ’46 will be recognized tomorrow with a prize that is the exclusive preserve of the University’s most loyal fans—the so-called Little Red Flag.
Lee, who went to his first Harvard-Yale game as a sixth-grader in 1935, and has been absent for only one of the storied showdowns since the end of World War II, is set to become not just a decorated fan but a standard-bearer for a revived tradition when he receives the flag before kickoff.
Between 1950 and 2000, the Flag was passed between the fans who had attended the most Harvard-Yale football games. But 10 years ago, the Varsity Club changed the tradition and it was instead occasionally presented to a “superfan”—a particularly devoted alum whose engagement with the school extended beyond football.
Last year, Spencer Ervin ’54 sent a letter to Harvard Magazine in hopes of putting the Flag back in the hands of the most regular fan. Among those involved was Jeffrey P. Lee ’74, Paul Lee’s son, who put Ervin in touch with his father.
Lee said that he and his father were piqued that devotion to Harvard Athletics would be judged on criteria other than attendance. With the help of other alums, the group made arrangements to produce a replica Flag that could be presented to a long-time attendee.
Jeffrey Lee—who himself has seen every Harvard-Yale game since 1960—said that his father has retained a passion for Harvard athletics throughout his adult life, and that for years, Paul, a Woodstock, Conn. resident, attended every Harvard football game, both at home and on the road.
It’s very nice,” said the elder Lee of his recognition. “I knew two of the fellows who had it before...It was disappointing to see that the flag was not going where it should have gone, and the fact that it has been revived is rather satisfying.”
According to his son, Lee’s attendance figures are a pure indication of his commitment to the sport of football. Unlike many of the students today, he said, Paul Lee partakes in the social scene minimally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many college athletes, the impending end of their playing careers can bring about a bit of an identity crisis.
But that wasn’t the case for Harvard coach Tim Murphy.
“I was a late bloomer and was not remotely highly recruited—I just had a love of the game,” Murphy says. “I consider myself very fortunate that I knew early on...when my career comes to an end as a player, I don’t want that to be the end of my experience with football.”
And so after a successful playing career at Springfield College, where he was a four-year starter at linebacker, Murphy took his talents from the field to the sideline—and immediately proved that he had a knack for coaching.
After eight seasons as an assistant, Murphy earned his first head-coaching job at Maine in 1987 at just 30 years old, making him the youngest head coach in the country at the time. In his first season, Maine made its first-ever appearance in the NCAA Division I-AA tournament.
Murphy moved to Division I-A two years later, taking over a Cincinnati program that was on probation, hadn’t had a winning season since 1982, and lacked adequate facilities. But in five seasons, Murphy turned the Bearcats from a struggling team to one that finished the 1993 season second in the “Also Receiving Votes” category of the of the USA Today/CNN poll, then the highest ranking in school history.
And that’s when Murphy decided to move on.
“It was difficult to leave because we had pulled off with a really great coaching staff, a great bunch of kids, something that was a real mountain to climb,” he admits. “To go from that to a bowl-caliber team in my tenure, we take great pride in that.”
But the combination of Murphy’s positive experience as an Ivy League assistant coach with Brown and a desire to move back to New England—the home of both Murphy and his wife, Martha—led the coach to Harvard.
“It was...looking back, a great decision,” he says. “Somehow, some things are meant to be.”
17 years later, Murphy has built the Crimson into a perennial powerhouse in the Ivy League.
“Coach Murphy is a great mentor,” junior linebacker Alex Gedeon says. “He has a ton of passion for what he does, and the way he carries himself is a way that I think inspires all of us players to look up to that and try to be like that someday.”
The numbers speak for themselves: 110 wins, five titles, two perfect seasons (the first such seasons since 1913), 69 All-Ivy first-team players, 21 alumni advancing to the professional level, and a 0.768 winning percentage from 2000-09, second-best in the FCS.
But what the numbers don’t quite capture is the impact Murphy has had on the character of the Harvard football program.
Making a commitment to developing the student-athlete rather than just the athlete, Murphy boasts a unique accomplishment—every four-year player he has recruited has both graduated and left with at least one Ivy ring.
“It sets the bar very high for every team every year, but it’s a great challenge to have,” he says. “I’m not sure we came in with that specific goal, but we’re especially proud as a staff and as players of that.”
Murphy’s players appreciate their coach’s willingness to look out for them.
“I have a fifth year of eligibility, and I’m coming back next year mainly because he’s that kind of guy who will do anything for his athletes,” adds senior defensive tackle Josué Ortiz. “In the spring when I’m taking off, he’s offered me a job. He helps me out with any problem I have. I always feel like I can go to him.”
For Murphy, recruiting the right kind of player is an important aspect of building up that sense of community.
“The recruiting formula was, ‘Find kids with great character,’” Murphy says. “If you can, find some kids who have had some adversity in their life, because my experience has been that those are the type of kids that are really going to maximize their potential...The more diversity you have, you seem to have an intangible strength that is unique.”
The atmosphere and attitude the coach has instilled in his program became especially apparent this year, when a slew of early-season injuries to key players could have derailed the season. But despite the setbacks, Harvard was in the title hunt into the second-to-last week of the season.
“We played with our third-string quarterback for almost half the season, but during that time [Murphy] was definitely preaching...how guys have to step up,” says senior defensive tackle Chuks Obi. “The team as a whole had to have a positive mental attitude. I think that helped.”
Murphy’s success with the Crimson football program has earned him numerous honors—including a nod as the American Football Monthly Division I-AA National Coach of the Year in 2004, an invitation to join the USO coaches’ tour last May, and an appointment to the American Football Coaches’ Association’s board of trustees, where he currently serves as second vice president.
“At one point, you’re 30 years old and the youngest head coach in the country, and you wake up and you’re 54 years old, and you’re not that kid anymore,” he explains. “So you do feel an obligation to help in any way that you can when you’re asked.”
But despite the attention, the titles, and the respect he has earned in his 17 years at Harvard, Murphy’s heart still lies with his family—both his wife and kids at home and the dozens of players on his roster. Fittingly, his favorite moment with the Crimson involves both sides of that family.
“I’m fighting my way across to shake hands with [Penn coach Al] Bagnoli,” Murphy says of the 2001 victory over the Quakers, which guaranteed Harvard a share of the Ivy title. “It’s just a mob of people, so I’m not having an easy time getting there, and somebody stomps hard down on my shoe. I look around, and it’s my eight-year-old son, and he had the biggest smile on his face...It’s just one of those never-forget moments.”
Although tomorrow’s game may not bring another title, with a chance to secure a perfect 4-0 record against Yale for his seniors, it could bring Murphy another unforgettable moment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As August faded into September and the football season loomed near, things were looking pretty good for Collier Winters. The 2009 season had been his coming-out party, and he celebrated in a big way, nearly leading the Crimson to a league title while racking up over 2,000 total yards in his third season. A threat through the air and on the ground, Winters earned a second-team All-Ivy selection for his play.
Understandably, expectations were high for the junior quarterback this year, with many predicting an Ivy League championship. The Sports Network even voted him the Ancient Eight’s preseason Player of the Year.
And then, in one play, his whole season was in jeopardy.
In the first quarter of the team’s first scrimmage, the quarterback suffered what appeared to be a season-ending injury.
“I had to avoid some pressure and rolled out to the right and made a throw,” Winters recalls. “At some point in my motion...I just heard a pop. [I] tore one of my groin muscles.”
The diagnosis wasn’t pretty. Harvard coach Tim Murphy openly acknowledged that he thought his quarterback was done for the year, and the same thought entered Winters’ mind.
“There was a lot of disappointment, maybe a little bit of worry about not being able to come back this season,” the quarterback says of the injury.
But Winters has had to deal with challenges his entire career. Rather than back down, he has embraced them.
The Oklahoma native began playing football in the second grade as a running back under the tutelage of his dad, Kevin Winters, a former outside linebacker at Kansas State. When the younger Winters entered high school, his father suggested a position switch to quarterback.
“I always wanted to be a running back, so I didn’t really want to switch at first,” Winters admits. “But eventually I started to like it a lot better, and it just felt pretty natural to step into that position.”
Winters’ play caught the eye of a number of Division I scouts. He committed to the University of New Mexico before receiving news that he would be offered a spot at Harvard, leading the signal caller to retract his commitment to the Lobos.
“I wasn’t quite sure if I would get into Harvard,” Winters says, “but then once I did, I always say it’s really not an opportunity you can pass up.”
The Kirkland House resident’s play was limited his freshman year, and after a torn labrum sidelined the quarterback in his second season, Winters decided to take a medical redshirt.
In 2009, his sophomore season, it was Winters’ turn to take the helm. But he had a tough act to follow. His predecessor, Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09, had been dominant, leading Harvard to two straight Ivy League championships and earning the 2008 Ivy League Player of the Year award.
“It’s really hard to fill a player like Chris Pizzotti’s shoes,” says senior running back Gino Gordon.
But Winters was up to the challenge.
“Most quarterbacks come in, and they’ve got time to learn [and] develop, but he came in and we had a championship-caliber team ready to go,” says junior wide receiver Levi Richards. “He did a great job of helping the team not miss a beat.”
At least a part of the quarterback’s success can be attributed to his work ethic.
“Physically, he’s an extremely talented guy.” Richards adds. “But the amount of work he puts into football...really shows in how he plays, and I think that’s the main reason he’s had so much success.”
Other than one loss to eventual league champion Penn, the Winters-led Crimson won all of its league games last year. Winters had the fewest interceptions of any quarterback in the Ivy League and also led the Ancient Eight in yards per completion and passer rating.
To cap it all off, the then-sophomore quarterback keyed a late victory against Yale in the 126th rendition of The Game.
It seemed that everything was falling into place for Winters, especially after he beat out senior Andrew Hatch in a quarterback battle in the spring. But after suffering what looked like a season-ending injury in early September, Winters’ plans for 2010 were dashed.
Unfazed, the former running back attacked his rehab with his characteristic energy and willpower.
“[Rehab] was definitely a big commitment and one of the harder things I’ve had to do,” Winters says. “[It required] really being disciplined with making sure to get all my rehab done.”
His teammates noticed his effort. Winters even carried a machine with him that would ice and steam his muscles, helping to expedite his recovery.
“It was unbelievable,” Richards says. “He had that [machine] everywhere with him, little briefcase for it...It was pretty funny.”
“But he probably still wouldn’t be out there if it weren’t for how hard he worked in coming back,” the receiver adds.
Winters’ effort paid off. After weeks of intense rehab, he was cleared before the Princeton game, eventually taking the field for the second half.
“I was excited...to come back and play,” Winters says. “It’s a lot of fun being out there, so I was just happy and relieved to get the chance...to go out there and play with the other 10 guys on offense.”
Despite the time away from the field, Winters caught up quickly. In just his second full game back, he threw for 246 yards, a career-high.
“He was definitely rusty in the second half against Princeton,” Murphy says. “[But against Dartmouth he] really increased our synchronicity, tempo, and just overall confidence as an offensive football team.”
After leading Harvard to convincing wins over Princeton, Dartmouth, and Columbia, Winters couldn’t solve a tough Penn defense, completing under 50 percent of his passes for the first time this year.
Now, there’s just one thing left this season for Winters to focus on: beating Yale again.
“I’m looking forward to the challenge,” Winters says.
As always.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard punt unit headed to the field for its first attempt against Columbia, the Lions’ radio broadcaster stared in disbelief.
“That’s got to be the stockiest punter in the Ivy League.”
The announcer wasn’t talking about usual starter, sophomore Jacob Dombrowski, who was sidelined by an ailing back that day. Instead, the Crimson had hastily trotted out junior linebacker Alex Gedeon, whose 230-pound frame looks more natural demolishing ballcarriers than kicking to them.
But after a Friday night phone call, a couple of warmup punts, and a lot of confusion, the special-teams experiment was underway. And once the ball left Gedeon’s foot, everyone seemed to forget whether he fit the typical mold.
“I’m on the punt team, and I didn’t even realize he was punting,” says senior defensive tackle Chuks Obi. “I found out afterwards, so I was kind of shocked. He did a pretty good job—I didn’t even notice a difference.”
It certainly wasn’t the first time the linebacker has impressed the Crimson with his versatility. Hailing from Hudson, Ohio, Gedeon was raised on a steady diet of football like any good Buckeyes fan. But when it became clear that Ohio State or Notre Dame might not come knocking, Gedeon realized that his versatile talents as a quarterback, defensive back, linebacker, and punter might come in handy elsewhere—and Crimson coach Tim Murphy agreed.
“In high school...he never came off the field,” Murphy said after the game against the Lions. “And you want to recruit athletes...kids that under pressure can do it, and number two you want to recruit guys that are versatile, because you never have enough athletes, you never have enough versatile guys. So [Gedeon] fits that.”
But when the junior arrived in Cambridge, most of the skill positions were filled, and converting to a full-time linebacker offered the best opportunity to get back on the field.
Although he was relegated to the bottom of the depth chart his freshman year, Gedeon took the time to rededicate himself to his best position.
“In high school, you sample a lot of different things but not one specific thing,” he says, “so playing just one position at linebacker in college has allowed me to be more fundamentally sound.”
With a strong corps of upperclassmen to learn from, including current senior teammate Nick Hasselberg, Gedeon quickly adjusted to the complicated Crimson playbook—and to the bruising his body would take at the college level.
“In football, and playing middle linebacker, the biggest thing is toughness, and [Gedeon] is very tough,” says senior defensive lineman Josué Ortiz. “He’s smart. He knows we have a very complex defense, [and] if you know what you’re doing, that’s 90 percent of the battle. He has a lot of heart, and he just wants to play.”
That determination showed as Gedeon battled injuries for his first couple of seasons. But after tirelessly rehabilitating and shoring up his skills, the junior arrived in the fall of 2010 a complete linebacker, and the coaching staff rewarded his effort with a starting spot.
“You always really look forward to those opportunities, so this whole offseason it was really exciting that I was going to be competing for that No. 1 job,” Gedeon says.
And the junior has made the most of the role. Gedeon has posted 32 tackles and a pair of interceptions—tied for second on the team—despite missing two contests this season. One of those picks came on Gedeon’s day of double-duty and halted a Lions drive deep in Crimson territory.
“He’s been able to overcome those injuries, and he’s had a big impact,” Ortiz says. “He’s a great leader, very vocal, and one of our much better underclassmen both in leadership and playing.”
And sometimes leadership goes beyond playing your position well. For Gedeon, taking on the extra burden as punter was just another way to help his team succeed.
“It says a lot about his character, because some guys, they won’t really want to be put in that spot,” Murphy says. “And now to be put in a position that is really critical, and a position that usually is only done by guys who that’s their only job...I think that says a lot about [Gedeon’s] confidence, a lot about his taking responsibility for his football team.”
By day’s end against Columbia, Gedeon proved to be much more than a stopgap solution on special teams. His net punting average of 36.8 yards—with a long of 47—topped both Lions punters, and in a game that began as a close contest, the junior proved instrumental in a convincing victory.
Two weeks later, Gedeon has largely given way to a healthy Dombrowski and returned to his normal duties at linebacker, which include protecting the punter on special teams. But with a couple of swings of his leg, Gedeon showed coaches and teammates his true versatility—a talent that allows him to make an impact from a variety of positions.
“First of all, I think Scott Larkee—our defensive coordinator and linebacker coach—he really does a great job in teaching and putting those kids in a position to have success,” Murphy says. “Then if you can take Alex, with that type of athleticism and that type of willingness to really study film and know where to be when [he]’s supposed to be there, you’re going to come up with a lot more big plays like [he’s made].”
And while Harvard is pleased enough to have a standout middle linebacker for two more seasons, the team’s true prize is a do-it-all athlete who won’t back down from a challenge.
“He’s been willing to do anything possible to help this team,” captain Collin Zych says. “You can’t ask for anything more than that.”
As the future anchor of the Crimson defense, Gedeon may not be itching for a dual role next season.
But as Zych points out, “He always jokes that he can still throw.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any star football player can identify the moment when he realized football was his destiny. For Josué Ortiz, it was a broken wrist. For Chuks Obi, it was a look in the mirror.
Offensive lines across the Ivy League wish these moments had never happened.
A regional wrestling champion in high school, Ortiz thought he’d compete in both sports for Harvard.
But when a broken wrist kept him off the mat his freshman year, the Florida native decided he’d use his wrestling skills to make him a better football player instead.
“You find a lot of the same principles in wrestling that are in football,” he says. “It really helped me develop as a player my footwork, leverage...and hand-eye [coordination].”
While an injury forced Ortiz to drop his second sport, Obi’s decision to focus on football was the result of the realization that his build was a better fit for the gridiron than the basketball court.
“I joined football late,” Obi explains. “I started playing football my sophomore year in high school...and I made the realization that my size would benefit me more in football than in basketball.”
But it wasn’t enough for the athletes to realize that their skill sets were best suited for the football field. They had to convince college coaches to agree with them, no small task given that neither came from high school football powerhouses.
“I definitely had to go out on my own,” Obi says.
But their football prowess was enough to attract the attention of Harvard.
Once on campus, both Obi and Ortiz went from standouts in small schools to the bottom of the depth chart on an already strong Crimson squad. The broken wrist meant that Ortiz had to sit out his freshman season, and even when healthy the two defensive tackles had to pay their dues on the practice field and in the weight room before they were ready to step up as starters.
But last fall the duo hit its stride, with both earning second-team All-Ivy honors and becoming mainstays on the Harvard defensive line. Obi and Ortiz attribute their success to their adherence to the Crimson’s rigorous conditioning regimen.
“Our offseason program is incredible here,” Ortiz says. “I played behind pretty good guys, and when it was my time to shine, I had these years of weight room, so that’s why I could step up.”
“All my summers were spent here in the Cambridge area working out with the team,” Obi adds. “That’s definitely paid off.”
This year, the two seniors have picked up right where they left off, combining for 78 tackles and 7.5 sacks.
“Josué and Chuks have been a luxury for us on defense,” captain Collin Zych says. “I don’t think there’s anyone in the league who can defend them both.”
Ortiz and Obi’s most obvious asset is their physical strength. Both can bench 400 lbs., and Ortiz “is north of that,” according to Crimson coach Tim Murphy.
Ortiz displayed his power in a game against Columbia when, unable to wrap up Lions quarterback Sean Brackett in a more traditional tackle, Ortiz spun Brackett around like a discus-thrower and tossed the hapless signal caller to the ground.
That physical strength, combined with the Ortiz’s and Obi’s quick hands and strong technique, has stifled opposing running attacks all season. Before giving up 150 rushing yards to first-place Penn last week, the Crimson had allowed an average of just 85.6 yards per game on the ground.
“They’re very hard to control,” Zych says. “This frees up other players...Teams can’t just line up and try to run the ball. Teams have to line up and do things they’re not used to doing to combat Josué and Chuks in the middle.”
The duo’s ability to stop the run makes many of its opponents one-dimensional. But as adept as Ortiz and Obi are at stopping the run, it’s on the pass rush when their speed and athleticism really shine.
“That’s when you kind of get to have a little fun,” Ortiz says. “What’s great about having Chuks as my teammate is generally the center three linemen, two guards and the center, block the two of us. So they can only double team one of us, [and] the other one is single blocked. So that’s when you’ve got to beat your guy and get back there...We’ve done a pretty good job of, if you’re single-blocked, you’ve got to beat the other guy and get pressure on the quarterback.”
Ortiz, in particular, has stood out for his ability to break through offensive lines with ease.
“[In practice] he’s always in our backfield,” Murphy says. “I’m constantly having to say, ‘Will someone please get Josué out of the backfield?’ Thankfully, we’re not the only ones who have that problem.”
In the Crimson’s contest against Dartmouth this fall, Ortiz put on a show, posting two sacks on a Big Green offensive line that hadn’t allowed a sack since the first half of its first game this season. With Obi and sophomore Alex Norman picking up sacks of their own, Harvard put up four times as many sacks as Dartmouth had allowed all year.
While Ortiz’s and Obi’s performance on the field stands on its own, their leadership among their teammates may be equally as valuable. Once quiet players content to let their play do the talking, Obi and Ortiz have emerged as vocal leaders and role models for younger players.
“It starts with leadership in practice,” Ortiz says. “So we kind of took it upon ourselves to teach the young guys.”
“They’re pretty quiet guys,” Zych notes. “In the past, they had never been rah-rah, hyping people up. They used to just show up and do a great job. This year, they have been more vocal. People will feed off their energy.”
This last development marks the completion of the remarkable, parallel journeys of the two impressive tackles. Once small-town football players struggling to get noticed, Obi and Ortiz have emerged as a two-headed force that’s impossible to ignore.
“The linemen who come in here as freshmen are boys, and the linemen who leave here are definitely men,” Murphy says. “And that’s the difference of what you see when you see Josué in a press conference compared to when he was a freshman—he’s a man. Those two guys are grown men.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard student body prepares for the festivities and excitement surrounding the 127th playing of The Game tomorrow at Harvard Stadium, one might think the Crimson football team would have difficulty staying similarly fired up after falling flat in its most important game of the season last week against Penn.
But despite losing its shot at an Ivy League title after its 34-14 dismantling in Philadelphia, Harvard (6-3, 4-2 Ivy) certainly still has a lot to play for against the Bulldogs.
For one, The Game represents an opportunity for the Crimson’s seniors to end their careers on a high note, and to finish a perfect 4-0 against Yale (7-2, 5-1). A win would also give the seniors the best record in the Ivies over their four years at Harvard, while earning the Crimson its 10th consecutive season with at least seven wins—a feat never accomplished in Ancient Eight history.
“It’s bittersweet,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy says. “More than anything, you want it to turn out right for [the seniors]...They’re such great kids. They’ve had such a big impact on our program...It’s tough to let go. It’s an emotional game.”
Another potentially motivating factor is that The Game offers the Crimson a chance to play spoiler. The Bulldogs need a win and a Quaker loss to earn a share of the Ivy title, and a Harvard victory would eliminate that possibility.
But most importantly, it’s easy for the Crimson’s players to stay motivated because the game is what it is—one of the greatest rivalries in all of college sports. Since the teams first met in 1875, Yale leads the all-time series 65-53-8. A Harvard win would move the team a little closer to .500 in a record book that goes back over a century, while giving its students highly-sought bragging rights over their New Haven counterparts at the sold-out contest tomorrow afternoon.
“I have no question the attitude’s going to be great,” Murphy says. “I think [the players] understand the meaning of this rivalry, how important it is to people, and especially the seniors...We’re playing for pride. Pride in our team, pride in our school, pride in our program.”
But for Harvard, pulling out a win will be no easy task with Yale boasting its best team since 2007, when the Bulldogs went 9-1 but lost the Ancient Eight title to the Crimson at The Game.
“Obviously we’re disappointed with the outcome [of the Penn game],” captain Collin Zych says. “But the ship rolls on...Considering the team [Yale] has this year, we can’t afford to come out and be flat. We need to make sure we’re completely focused.”
The Bulldogs are led at quarterback by junior Patrick Witt, who has thrown for a conference-high 2018 yards this season, along with 12 touchdowns offset by an equal number of interceptions. Yale’s aerial attack is complemented by a solid ground game led by Witt’s classmate Alex Thomas, who is third in the Ivies with 639 rushing yards and has found the endzone six times.
“[Thomas] had a great game against us last year,” Zych says. “[The Bulldogs] will come into this game thinking they can run the football. It’s a personal challenge to stop the run and get that out of their minds.”
Yale senior wideout Gio Christodoulou is fourth in the Ancient Eight with 520 receiving yards and has caught one touchdown pass. The Bulldogs offense has average 22.6 points per game, leaving them at sixth in the league.
For the Crimson, junior quarterback Collier Winters has been inconsistent since returning from injury five weeks ago and is coming off a three-interception performance against Penn. Classmate Adam Chrissis emerged as the team’s go-to target this season and has 477 receiving yards.
The true strength of the Harvard attack lies in the running game. Senior Gino Gordon passed the 1,000-yard mark last week and has the chance to take the league’s rushing title away from Dartmouth’s Nick Schwieger—whom he currently trails by five yards—in his final career game.
Gordon and company will be facing a Yale squad that ranks fourth in the conference in total defense. Bulldogs junior linebacker Jordan Haynes is third in the Ancient Eight with 88 tackles, while senior cornerback Adam Money is tied for second with three interceptions.
“They’ve got outstanding players at every level, so you can’t just account for one guy,” Murphy says of Yale’s defense. “We have to play our game, and that means everybody doing their job. We’re at our best when we’re pretty unpredictable.”
Zych leads the way for the second-ranked Crimson defense with 73 tackles and three interceptions, while senior defensive tackle Josué Ortiz is second in the conference with six sacks and first in tackles for loss.
If the game comes down to special teams, Harvard could have an advantage if they can control return man Chris Smith, a dangerous sophomore who has taken two kickoffs to the house this year. Yale punter Alex Barnes ranks second-to-last in the league with 36.3 yards per punt. Bulldog kicker Phillipe Panico is just 6-of-13 on the season, but has connected on all of his field goals inside of the 40-yard-line this season.
“They have our attention,” Murphy says of the Bulldogs. “Clearly this is one of the top teams in the Ivy League...They’re good on offense; they’re good on defense; they’re good on special teams. They don’t have any specific weaknesses.”
Last year, Harvard stunned Yale with two touchdowns in the final seven minutes after Bulldog coach Tom Williams called a now-infamous fake punt on fourth and 22 late in the fourth quarter. The game ended with a Gatorade bath for Murphy as Harvard students stormed the field, a conclusion the Crimson’s seniors hope to end their own careers with tomorrow.
“Our senior class has been lucky enough to beat Yale in our first three years,” Zych says. “That’s a big motivating factor for our seniors. On a personal note, it’s the last game I’ll play—more than likely the game that I will remember the most. So I need to make sure I do everything possible to play well so we can come out with a victory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How can you top an undefeated season, a national title, and an Ancient Eight crown?
It might seem like a daunting task, but the Harvard women’s squash team has the answer: do it all again.
Coming off its stellar 2009-2010 season, the women of the Crimson squad have undoubtedly set a high bar. The crew went 12-0 on the season—without question aided by its top-to-bottom roster strength: 10 of the team’s 15 players posted undefeated records in dual season play.
Last season, Harvard took home its 17th CSA national championship, 11th Barhite Award (given to the team with the best dual record nationwide), and 12th Ivy League title. Then-rookie Laura Gemmell also earned her very own national title, beating out Trinity’s Pamela Hathway to capture the Ramsay Cup in five close games.
Harvard will kick off the new season this Friday ranked by the CSA as the team to beat—preseason polls slotted the Crimson at the top of the preliminary heap.
But the team is anything but complacent, especially after the rather unexpected outcome of CSA’s recent Ivy Scrimmages.
Held at Yale’s Brady Squash Center over the first weekend of November, the Harvard squad faced an upset at the hands of Yale; the crew dropped the match, 6-3, to finish the weekend in second place behind its New Haven host.
Under new coach Mike Way, however, the high expectations and preseason jitters will hopefully do little to distract the team from accomplishing its main goal: winning another championship.
“My job as a coach is to keep them focused on performance goals,” Way said. “Mentally, it’s a little tougher because there’s so much expectation. But if they do a good mental program, and we keep our eye on their own individual performances, that’s when we can get the results…We have to be staying…process-oriented and not outcome-oriented.”
The Crimson also enters the season very confident in its roster. The team graduated only three players last year, and three new freshmen are joining a crew that boasts experience from the bench on up.
Take, for example, senior Bethan Williams. As a 2008-2009 CSA All-American (second team), Williams rotated between the No. 8 and No. 9 positions last season. On another team, someone at her level of play could easily start at the top of the roster.
Another key player returning to the Barnaby Courts is captain and three-time All-American Alisha Mashruwala. Holding down the captain position by herself, her senior leadership will be instrumental in motivating her team on and off the court.
“I couldn’t ask for a better captain,” Way said of the veteran. “She’s a leader, she’s organized, she’s a motivator, and she doesn’t get too excited when she needs to be calm and equitable for the team.”
Senior June Tiong, junior Nirasha Guruge, and sophomore Natasha Kingshott are among a host of other talented players also making the return from last season.
Both Tiong and Guruge, for instance, have been named to the CSA All-America second team; Kingshott, in her rookie season, compiled an impressive 11-0 record at the No. 5 spot.
And finally, there’s Gemmell, who didn’t drop a single game in regular season play as she compiled an 11-0 record from the No. 1 position. Post-national competition, the rookie was 16-0 with numerous accolades under her belt: CSA Individual National Champion, All-America first team and All-Ivy League team honors, and Ivy League Player and Rookie of the Year.
Friday evening officially marks the start of the 2010-2011 season, as Harvard takes on No. 10 Brown at the Barnaby Courts. The action will continue through the weekend when Harvard faces No. 6 Stanford and No. 9 Williams in a Sunday double-header.
After the Thanksgiving break, the team will be back in action against No. 8 Dartmouth at home and then No. 7 Cornell for its first game outside of Cambridge.
Following winter break, the squad will face its toughest competition. After playing No. 12 Bates, the Crimson will face the lethal lineup of No. 3 Trinity, No. 5 Penn, No. 4 Princeton, and No. 2 Yale to finish off the regular season.
“My feeling is that Yale, Princeton, and Trinity…seem to be the three other teams along with us that I think are the strongest teams vying for top spots this year,” Way said.
Mashruwala agreed with her coach’s assessment, but her focus remains on the challenges at the present.
“[Yale and Trinity] are matches that are later in the season,” Mashruwala said. “We’re basically taking each match as it comes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time of the year again, ladies and gentlemen: The Game.
And not just any Game, kids, it’s my final Game.
That’s right, four years at Yale have finally brought me to this point.
A lot’s happened in four years: I no longer want to save the world (hello, Wall Street!), I’ve actually successfully managed to get into those fabled places called seminars (1400 pages of reading per week FTW!), and I have continued to have zero luck with the ladies (ughhh).
However, the most important thing I’ve picked up from my twenty-one years (besides blissful alcoholic legality) is to know to stay the heck away from that freezing hellhole some call Cambridge.
Yale has been 0–3 at in my tenure as resident drunk fan in the stands, and I don’t know if I want to suffer another nutmeg-grounding loss at the hands of the Cantabs while contracting hypothermia and gluteal frostbite.
A couple weekends ago, my mom called to find out when I should book tickets to fly home for our glorious, week-long Thanksgiving break (suck it, Harvard). “Are you going to The Game?” she asked.
I took a deep breath and exhaled. “In this fall—and this is very tough…I’m going to take my talents to Cambridge and watch the Harvard-Yale game.”
Why? For one, I’m doing the gameday radio color commentary on wybcx.com (your home for Yale sports), so I kinda sorta have to be there.
But even if I weren’t, I would make the trip because—for the first time in my four years of lackluster academic performance and sporadically habitual inebriation—Yale is going to WIN.
That’s right, Mr. Walsh of The Harvard Crimson, Yale is going to WIN.
Now, I know you’ve got the same “huh?” expression on your face as the time you watched Snooki hook up with Vinny on “Jersey Shore,” but trust me, I’ve got my reasons for that bold prediction,
1) The Luck of the Lin is gone.
Over the course of my lengthy research for The Game, one statistical anomaly in Harvard’s wins kept popping up: the presence of Jeremy Lin on the Cantab campus.
For those of you who don’t go to Harvard (a.k.a., you have lives), Jeremy Lin was a starting guard for the Cantab basketball team. After four years of destroying Ivy League opponents, he became the first Asian-American shorter than a skyscraper to make it to the NBA. In other words, he was a resolute middle finger to every stereotype out there. Besides being an inspiration to all vertically-challenged Asian basketballers (like yours truly), Jeremy provided the mythical “Luck of the Lin” for the last three years (he had not yet acquired it in his freshman year).
However, with the Golden State Warriors playing the Lakers the next day, Lin will not be in attendance for this year’s biennial Boston crackdown on collegiate drinking. With no Luck of the Lin to stop an otherwise successful fourth-and-22 conversion from their own 28-yard line, the Bulldogs will clearly rumble to victory.
2) We have celebrity on our side.
Have you heard of “Spider-Man”? Or “Spider-Man 2”? How about “Spider-Man 3”? If you try real hard, you’ll find the one commonality between those three movie titles: that’s right, James Franco. Now, I don’t know about you Cantabs, but my homepage happens to be Perez Hilton—and a while back, he and the screaming horde of girls outside my window told me that James “OMGZ he’s SOOOO HOT” Franco was going to be a Yalie in the English department.
Armed with one of GQ’s 2010 Men of the Year and resident Yale graduate-school hottie, the Bulldogs offer more than enough star power to take it to the house over and over again. Plus, if you squint real hard, legendary Bulldog receiver Chris Smith ’13 could easily pass off as Channing Tatum of “Step Up,” “Step Up 2: The Streets,” and “Dear John” fame (yeah, I watch chick flicks—so what?). Smith recently set an all-time Ivy League record by returning two kickoffs back for touchdowns (in a row). Clearly, he was channeling his inner Channing.
3) 2010 has been a change-inducing year.
Think about it. The Republicans defenestrated the Democrats in the House. LeBron James went from the most beloved basketball player to the most hated one faster than you can yell “Don’t tase me, bro” at Club Elevate. Brett Favre is still playing football (okay, bad example).
The point is, something is in the water, and it’s changing the status quo. With Harvard winning eight of the last nine Games, it’s time for a change we can believe in. This is year two of the Tom Williams regime, and already, we’re starting to see changes. The Bulldogs rebounded from 2-5 in the Ivy League last year to 5-1 so far. Senior safety Adam Money ’11, besides having an awesome name, is on track to set all kinds of Yale records with eight career interceptions (and counting). There is a changing atmosphere of success around the team, and they’re ready to turn this thing around.
In conclusion, Harvard sucks, and Mr. Walsh, if you manage to stay until the end of this Game, I’ll buy you a pizza from the mean streets of CT.
Besides, it’s not like we’re gonna go for it on fourth-and-22 again, right? RIGHT?!?!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s pretty much a foregone conclusion that Harvard will beat Yale yet again.
I’ve known this inevitability since this time last year, when an almost Biblical allegory unfolded on the streets of Connecticut.
The night following The Game—after a little Toad’s and a lot of drifting between empty frat houses—my friends and I ended up at A One Pizza, looking to enjoy a slice of New Haven’s tastiest pies.
Minding our own business as we stood in line, a disgruntled Yalie (British accent, crew team) accosted one of my friends—an innocent bystander in the Harvard-Yale rivalry—and the two of them shared some unpleasant words.
When it came time to pay for his pizza, my friend used his credit card, but, after he put the receipt down on the counter, the sneaky Eli wrote in a $20 tip.
Now, I respect that guy’s hustle. That move is the stuff great rivalries are made of.
But my friend, once he was alerted to Eli’s generosity, did not take kindly to the scheme.
As their ensuing argument spilled out into the street, a figure emerged from the darkness, his duster billowing freely as a cape.
His name was Joe Comfort. Or perhaps I should say “Joe Comfort, Street Legend,” which is the name he told us to search for on Wikipedia.
I don’t know if Joe Comfort already has this reputation in New Haven, but he is an urban angel who serves and protects street justice.
With his supernatural sense of fairness, Joe Comfort obviously sided with the good guys and approached the now-whimpering Bulldog.
Punching a brick wall to showcase his Bowser-like strength, Joe Comfort indicated that if restitution were not made, he would pop the Yalie’s kidneys like a zit.
Of course, Eli sheepishly repaid my friend the $20, of which he gave Joe Comfort a fitting portion.
I share this story because it perfectly parallels The Game from last year.
Holding a 10-0 lead late in the fourth quarter, the Bulldogs, perhaps surprised at their temporary competence, foolishly began to believe they could beat Harvard; similarly, the Yale undergrad was up, $0 to -$20, and thought he was in the clear. But the Crimson clawed its way back with a 41-yard touchdown pass from Collier Winters to Matt Luft, just like my friend rallied by taking the fight outside on Broadway.
Both conflicts were up for grabs at some point. And then a wild card intervened. Tom Williams called for a fake punt on fourth-and-22 that failed and gave Harvard great field position; Joe Comfort swooped into action to fight for truth, justice, and the Crimson way.
Ultimately, due to cosmic forces—Tom Williams’ bone-headedness and Joe Comfort’s heroism—each event reached its appropriate outcome. Harvard won, 14-10, on a 32-yard touchdown catch by Chris Lorditch, and the sneaky Eli forked over an Andrew Jackson.
Now I admit, I wasn’t there to see the Crimson’s comeback last year. In the middle of the fourth quarter, I walked the 5k back to Saybrook College to take a nap in my friend’s room. But that’s only because I already knew we’d win (and I like naps). I have supreme faith in these mystical forces of good that ensure that Harvard prospers and Yale suffers.
For that reason, I have no doubt the Crimson will win once again. I don’t even need to examine the rosters or break down the matchups. So what if Harvard is looking up at the Bulldogs in the Ivy League standings right now. Want to know what that reminds me of? 2007, when the Crimson ruined Yale’s perfect season and stole the league title with a 37-6 curb-stomping at the Yale Bowl.
Yes, I fully expect to win and to complete The Grand Slam: a 4-0 record in The Game as an undergrad. It’s so inevitable at this point that I can’t muster much vitriol for the Bulldogs. In fact, I feel sorry for them. Between the impending loss and Harvard’s draconian tailgate restrictions, Yalies are bound to have a lousy time this weekend. But, at least for a day, when they look across the stadium at the shining faces of the “10,000 Men [and Women] of Harvard,” they get a sense of what life would be like if they hadn’t gone to a safety school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, there’s even more to be excited about than just the Harvard/Yale football game, as the Crimson men’s squash team officially begins its 2010-11 campaign with two important tests at home.
Tonight, Harvard will take on Brown in its first non-scrimmage Ivy League matchup of the year. And, after the madness of tomorrow's football extravaganza, the Crimson will conclude a jam-packed sports weekend with a match against Williams on Sunday.
These first two contests are key for Harvard, as the Crimson attempts to improve upon last year’s solid fifth-place finish at the CSA National Team Championships. Though Harvard will miss reigning CSA individual champion Colin West ’10 and his talented classmates, a cohesive mixture of 11 upperclassmen and six freshmen looks to compete with the top teams in the nation this season.
One week ago, at the annual Ivy League Scrimmages, the Crimson defeated Princeton, 5-4, before losing to the Bulldogs by a score of 8-1 in the final round of the preseason tournament. Though a loss to Yale is always disappointing, the early season victory against the Tigers bodes well for Harvard in Ivy League competition.
Returners for the Crimson, including senior Richard Hill, sophomore Zeke Scherl, captain J. Reed Endresen, and sophomore Jason Michas—No. 2-5 respectively last season—will likely anchor the team in its quest to be the best in the league.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the magical universe of Harry  Potter, quidditch is pretty much the bomb. The beaters, chasers,  and seekers that populate its arenas are the coolest kids in town—flying around on broomsticks and dodging bewitched cannonballs seems  like a hardcore feat of athletic prowess like no other, after all.
In the (sadly) magic-free world of  Harvard, quidditch is a little bit different.
The players do still ride on broomsticks  in pursuit of the quaffle or snitch, just like Harry and the gang do.
The Harvard Horntails, however, don’t  get to fly through the air gracefully. Rather, one could say they’ve  perhaps perfected a waddle-sprint hybrid to motor themselves around  the playing field.
Bludgers provide another threat that  has migrated from the wizarding world to the normal one. Getting hit  by one of these bad boys is a lethal threat to the team’s offense  and defense—for Harry and the gang, it usually means a broken limb  or a long, spiraling plummet from broomstick to earth.
For the Crimson players, it might mean  a bruise or slight sting from a dodgeball, and also the mandatory post-hit  lap around the goal posts.
Ouch.
And, perhaps most important of all,  the golden snitch has fluttered into the Muggle community here as well.
Instead of chasing the snitch on broomsticks,  Harvard quidditch players get to chase around a tennis ball inside a  sock, which is in turn bouncing around inside the shorts of a man in  yellow running around a field.
Yet, jokes aside, the College does,  in fact, recognize the Harvard quidditch team as an official club sport!  And, if you take time to actually understand the magic-free version  of the game, you’ll be quite surprised to find the level of athleticism  it actually takes—just as this wary Crimson editor was.
Quidditch, as the Harvard Horntails  know it, is an interesting mix of dodgeball, flag football, rugby,  and basketball. Players must get the quaffle (in Harry's world, the only ball that is  not bewitched) into one of three hoops (a la basketball) on their opponent’s end of the field, and as they do so they  must avoid being hit by their opponents’ bludgers (dodgeballs, in  actuality). If they are hit, the players must run back and loop around  their own goal posts before they can rejoin the game, throwing a wrench  in both offensive and defensive plays and giving the opponent some serious  leverage.
And although the image of the man in  yellow seems perhaps a bit ludicrous, these players—the carriers  of the snitches—are nearly always trained cross country or track  runners. The snitch carrier runs on and off the field and doesn’t  stop until his snitch is successfully taken: this means game over.
Newly armed with knowledge of the athletics  of quidditch, then, it’s safe to say that props need to be given for  the Crimson’s success at the Quidditch World Cup this weekend. The  team went 2-1 in group play and finished 18th of 48 teams. Tufts, our friendly neighbor, finished second.
So, next time you see some Harvard  Horntails roaming around campus, be sure to give them a thumbs up!

We’ve been counting down the days until the big day, but the most important game has finally arrived. It’s time for the Harvard-Yale football game! The football team squares off against Yale in the Stadium tomorrow at noon. Harvard has been dominant in recent years. The Crimson will be looking for its fourth straight win over the Bulldogs and has won eight of the last nine games, including last year’s exciting 14-10 victory at Yale.
Even though the major focus is on Harvard-Yale this weekend, the men’s basketball team takes on Mercer tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m. Last weekend, the men opened up their season with a loss against George Mason, but came back strong with a win on Wednesday night, crushing Holy Cross, 72-49. The last time the teams met, the Crimson won by a large margin, 91-73. The women’s squad faces off against Navy tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. as part of the Navy Classic. The women are 2-0 so far for the season, beating Maine and Oral Roberts in their opening games. The two teams have only met once before. Last year, the women took down the Mids, 71-55.
The men’s and women’s hockey teams also hit the road this weekend. The men’s team takes on Princeton tonight at 7 p.m. and Quinnipiac tomorrow night at the same time. The men currently stand at 2-2, after splitting games last weekend against St. Lawrence and Clarkson. The women have a similar season record, 2-2-2, losing to Quinnipiac and tying Princeton last weekend. The squad squares off against Dartmouth this weekend in a double-header, taking the Big Green on at home tonight at 7 p.m. and traveling up to Hanover tomorrow afternoon. The Crimson has won six of the past seven meetings.
The men’s and women’s squash teams will compete at home against Brown tonight and Williams on Sunday afternoon. The women also take on Stanford in an extra match on Sunday morning at 10 a.m. These are the openings matchups of the season for both teams. Last year, the men defeated both Brown and Williams in its opening weekend of play, 9-0 and 6-3, respectively. The women’s squad started out impressively last season, crushing its opponents 9-0 in its first four matches, including victories against Brown and Williams.
Crimson squads are also taking place in some of the biggest tournaments of the season. The men’s and women’s cross country teams travel to Bronx, N.Y. for the IC4A/ECAC Championships tomorrow. At home, men’s lightweight crew will compete in the Tail of the Charles tomorrow. Finally, the wrestling team faces off against Michigan State, Eastern Michigan, and Penn State in the Journeyman Sprawl & Brawl. The men competed in an individual event last week, with Corey Jantzen and Walter Peppelman reaching the finals in their respective weight classes.
