After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undocumented immigrants are often painted as murderous criminals, violating immigration controls because of their fundamental lawlessness. They are seen as a single wave, a Latino tide crashing over the southern border. They are seen as a threat, one that requires a border wall and the National Guard. But we can’t talk about the complex nature of immigration when we’re too busy reifying the immigrants of the past as law-abiding, hard-working, real Americans and demonizing immigrants today.
So this is a story of my immigrant past. It’s about my great-grandmother, Mollie Plotkin. Grandma Mollie embodied many of the traits we so admire in our immigrant forbears. She was hard working—so hard working that once, when she broke her arm, she kept going back to work for a week before she had it looked at. She was frugal. She made sure her children got a good education.
There’s another narrative, closer to the harsh realities of immigration. Grandma Mollie and her father stood on a massive line at Ellis Island, waiting to fill out their paperwork with one of the clerks. The clerk glanced at Grandma Mollie and asked her father how old this little girl was. He, overburdened with anxiety, said “six” when he meant “four.” A simple mistake, it seems. But to my great-great-grandfather, not yet fully escaped from Tsarist Russia, there were no simple mistakes when it came to bureaucrats. Rather than correct himself, he waited until his paperwork was completed. He stepped away from the desk. And he bent down and told Grandma Mollie that she was six, now, not four. She had to remember that.
We didn’t hear this story until after I was born, actually. Grandma Mollie obeyed her father’s instructions perfectly, and not until she was in a nursing home did she reveal this crucial detail of her life. The numbers in the story above are approximations, nothing more. We can’t be sure.
And there’s one more story about Grandma Mollie that I need to tell here. Grandma Mollie was an illegal immigrant. Not like one that we imagine today, smuggled across the southern border. But when Grandma Mollie was held in detention on Ellis Island, the authorities started to talk about sending her back. Her family arrived—with a bribe. Money changed hands, papers were adjusted, and my great-grandmother entered the country.
Her children were born American citizens—and she died one herself. Grandma Mollie was illegal, but she wasn’t undocumented. Bribes are a better strategy than coyotes. I heard this story casually when I was young. The fear was gone by then. Those who had paid the bribes and those who had taken them had passed away, and what would the Immigration and Naturalization Service do? Deport a great-grandmother back to her country, which no longer even existed?
This is the immigrant narrative I turn to to escape from the black-and-white rhetoric on immigration. Grandma Mollie’s family came with her here to work hard and better themselves, and they did break laws along the way. They were criminals, but I cannot condemn them for it. Maybe at the turn of the last century we could have caught the bribe and sent her and her family back. But by now her thread is woven into the great weft of America. Her story is her own, but it’s intimately tied to that of our country.
So rather than taking to the battlements of the immigration debate, we should take to our homes. Before we condemn today’s immigrants in wide swaths, we must come to terms with our own mixed, complex pasts.

The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert yesterday warning citizens to exercise extra caution if traveling to Europe, effective from now until Jan. 31. Apparently, when the name “Osama Bin Laden” enters airwaves, it’s time to stick our heads in the sand and wait until the safety of February travel. Unfortunately, the world does not strictly follow U.S. travel alerts. It’s never particularly safe to travel—and that shouldn’t matter.
In a nation overloaded with counter-terrorism and security experts and watchers, we have become masters of the vague threat alert. The latest: terrorists mimicking the tactics of the tragic 2008 Mumbai attacks in any one of Europe’s three biggest countries. Osama Bin Laden may or may not be involved; so might other leaders. Of course, the same experts who can divine terrorists’ intent do so only before strictly necessary. The official who spoke to the Associated Press also said there were no indications that there was a capability of such attacks to actually take place. So to summarize: Al-Qaeda wants to attack tourists in Europe but probably doesn’t have new methods to do so.
This is newsworthy if you strongly believed that Al-Qaeda didn’t want to attack Europe. I, for one, was expecting Middle Earth to be a target—but the intent to target the United Kingdom, France, or Germany? This New Yorker and eyewitness of the 2006 Heathrow terrorism scare never saw that one coming.
Of course, I may have been too flippant just now, but consider what this travel alert really means. It’s not as serious as a “Travel Warning,” such as is currently in place for Mexico. The struggling war on drugs in that country is rated as a higher risk for Cabo San Lucas aficionados. In Europe, the State Department just wants you to be mindful of “the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure.” Tourists should remember that they are not safe on subway, rail, aviation, and maritime services. The State Department must not have to take taxis when they travel—if cabs are the only safe mode of transportation left to us, we are in trouble.
The United Kingdom duly followed the United States in upping its traveler threat level. France was already at its second-highest threat level, which apparently already included vague, non-imminent attack possibilities, so they stayed put. No arrests have been made in connection to the alleged plot that has sparked all this. The BBC, however, reports that, according to “European officials,” several people are still under surveillance. This should be particularly troubling here in a nation where we are used to not a single person ever being under surveillance, thanks to the Constitutional stand taken by the Bush administration. Oh, wait.
Along with the media’s job to report that the State Department issued this warning—and if you agree with the warning, you should be glad that the media duly publicizes it—the media has of course not let us down in adding a hysteria factor to the story. The BBC, in a mostly responsible article on the alert that concludes with a section on America’s corresponding increase in drone attacks in Pakistan, still includes a gem speculating that the alert may hurt European tourism industries. Then there are whole articles that write this speculation large. The Associated Press, for example, posits that Europe’s economy may take a hit before quoting experts as saying that it actually will be the same. Well done, AP: providing a balanced look at a ridiculous question by contrasting the comments of several random, concerned tourists with the opinions of actual experts who don’t see this as a major concern yet.
If anything, the speculation of a financial effect from this travel alert will be potentially self-fulfilling. Spreading doubt sells, but it also creates more doubt. Hopefully those who are considering travel to Europe will take in the State Department’s alert, process it, and continue with their plans. Reading stories about how they might stay at home, hurting European business, would only make them reconsider whether they should in fact stay (to avoid hypocrisy—travelers reading this story: Go!).
All travel comes with risk. An attack may happen eventually in Europe; it’s happened in the recent past in Madrid, London, and elsewhere. That attack may even have similarities to Mumbai and would be a human disaster. We must of course hope that any such attempts are thwarted before they begin. Yet, if such an attack does happen, it will not validate this alert and its media attention. Tourists should always be vigilant and aware of their surroundings—traveling in a foreign place is not entirely safe even without the prospect of terrorism. Tourists can get robbed, ripped off, scammed—it happens every day in every travel destination in the world.
Such generalized, half-measure alerts may appease the 24-hour news cycle. The government can always say—if something tragic does happen—that it warned its citizens to be vigilant. But vigilance alone would most likely not be enough to ensure safety in such a situation. And we should all keep our eyes open when we travel, if only to avoid the guy on the corner who won’t leave us alone until we buy one of his Eiffel Tower pencil sharpeners.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although America boasts a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, recent data collected from a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center testing general knowledge of different religious beliefs indicate that Americans, regardless of their denomination, are frighteningly unknowledgeable about their neighbors’ religious beliefs. Some denominations are more uninformed than others, but the average American knows less about religion than common discourse presumes. Armed with these low numbers, select advocates of teaching religion in our nation’s public schools are pressing harder than ever to see their vision realized. However, giving states the ability to design their own religion curricula—when some schools are already attempting to insert creationism into science classes—would potentially lead to disastrous ends and should not be implemented.
The federal government has little control over exactly what and how teachers teach their students. State education boards that are currently attempting to limit the references to Islam in their schools’ textbooks simply cannot be trusted to aptly portray all religions in an objectively comparative and fair manner. The effect of affording states this ability would be a much greater disparity of understanding than already exists concerning a subject that incites strong emotional responses between individuals.
Even though Americans may not know a lot about other religions, previous surveys have shown that America is among the most religious of the world’s developed nations. Nearly 60 percent of U.S. adults say that religion is “very important” in their lives, and roughly 40 percent say they attend worship services at least once a week. On a local level, teachers that affiliate with a religion possess a personal identification with that faith. Because religion is likely an emotionally charged area of those teachers’ lives, it would not be equivalent to teaching another history, science, or math class. Instead, in many classrooms, there would be an inevitable personal bias inflicted on the subject by the teacher.
Although we do not believe that this poll means that religion should be taught in classrooms, it does indicate how many citizens could, and indeed should, benefit from learning about different faiths. This call needs to be answered by other forces in students’ environments: Religious organizations can inform their constituencies about other faiths in addition to their own, and there could be a nationally acknowledged day in which Americans meditate on the vast pluralism of this country’s beliefs.
It would simply be unreasonable for a secular country that places an emphasis on the separation of church and state to require religion to be taught in its classrooms. There does, however, need to be a reevaluation of how and where American youth obtain religious knowledge—but in a way that will spread intercultural understanding, not further bigotry and misinformation. That specific influence over tomorrow’s America cannot be given to those who would breed any more ignorance than already persists.

Political and religious discourse have always been intimately bound in America. Today as ever, the United   States is an intensely religious place. Nine in 10 Americans consider themselves religious, and almost as many self-identify as Christian. Indeed, Protestant morality informs many of the laws and attitudes that govern our society. But in a globalized world, Americans cannot afford to be ignorant of the religious beliefs held by others, especially the growing religious minorities in our own country. Much of the commentary and advice bandied about the airwaves and into American living rooms by televangelist political pundits like Glenn Beck require just such knowledge of listeners, if these claims are to be critically examined for their validity.
It is for this reason that the results of the Pew Research Center’s recent survey of Americans’ religious knowledge are particularly worrisome and must be addressed. They show a widespread ignorance of non-Christian faith among members of the largest religious groups. In a country where religion is often used both as a point of distinction between groups of people and as an argument toward political ends—as during the recent Ground Zero mosque debate—it is essential that this ignorance be erased.
The best practical fix would rely on the public school system; that is, indeed, its purpose. States ought to institute a comparative-religion curriculum that familiarizes students with the basics of all major world religions. In so doing, they will ensure that most Americans become discerning world citizens less likely to believe and proliferate the bigoted generalizations and pure falsehoods about other faiths that often go unchallenged in today’s political arena.
Comparative religion classes by definition give every religion, including Christianity, a critical but fair shake, regardless of the religious beliefs represented by the students in the classroom, their teachers, or the members of the regional school board. It is meant to inform, not convert—to educate, not preach. One can learn about the nature of the Hajj, Rosh Hashanah, or the Bhagavad Gita without putting the validity of Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu beliefs in contest with one another.
Critics of such a requirement argue that teachers are not to be trusted—that they will unconstitutionally proselytize from the chalkboard. But comparative religion is already a common offering at many universities and private high schools, including Harvard. It is a well-defined subject with an established canon of textbooks and lesson plans.
Teachers who stray too far, whether Muslim, Christian, or atheist, will be held accountable by students, if not administrators or parents, all of whom can take legal recourse as they often do when public schools confront breakdowns in the separation of church and state. Furthermore, states themselves can examine and ensure the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of what is being taught in their school systems by means of the teacher evaluations and standardized testing that are increasingly taking hold nationwide.
Suggesting that comparative religion should not be taught anywhere simply because it might not be taught correctly is absurd. Comparative religion, like any other coursework, is always to some degree subject to instructor bias. Should we recommend that students in Texas not be taught any science whatsoever just to avoid the risk that a handful will be exposed to creationism alongside evolution? Or axe history altogether because some teachers may particularly despise communism? Allowing ignorance to go unchallenged is no better than reinforcing it, and is certainly not part of the path to progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 3 2010, I wrote here about how Sri Lanka stepped into post-war peace over one of the most violent presidential elections ever recorded. However, I never thought post-war peace and new rule of law would grow up to be strong enough to make the united opposition presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka end up in jail. Sarath Fonseka, the four-star general who survived two suicide bomb attacks from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, apparently made clear political mistakes during the presidential election. First, he stressed the importance of political reconciliation among former enemies in the war. Second, he openly said that he will testify in the International Court of Justice that no military officer in the Sri Lankan army gave orders to any soldier to shoot rebels surrendering with white flags if that had ever happened, as foreign media reported. He affirmed that if such a thing had happened, it must have been due to some non-military authority giving orders to do so. While trying to make the point that Sri Lankan civilization is built on moral values of forgiveness, compassion, and loving, kindness, he gave a clear boost to Rajapakse’s campaign, based on patriotism and euphoria of a military victory over Tamil Tigers.
Sarath Fonseka lost the presidential election, and Mahinda Rajapakse started his way of enjoying the victory. On Feb. 8 2010, a battalion of army personnel was sent to arrest Sarath Fonseka. The commanding officer of this battalion had apparent conflict of interest because he had been an officer punished by General Fonseka for wrongdoing. Eyewitnesses reported that the scene of the arrest was a very bitter one, where the once-decorated army commander had been dragged along the floor by the neck. Mahinda Rajapakse, as the commander-in-chief of the three forces, appointed a panel of military judges to hear two court martial cases. Apparent irregularities in this process were challenged several times, and the composition of judges had to be changed several times. General Fonseka, who was suffering from severe internal injuries due to the suicide bomb attacks on him, was kept in a cell without adequate ventilation. Doctors had made it mandatory for him to breathe fresh air and exercise regularly. Somehow his personal doctor was given the opportunity to see him, and his health situation was brought under control. This courageous man won a parliamentary seat from Colombo district while in custody. Though several breath-taking political maneuvers kept him from attending the parliamentary sessions, the voice of the united opposition won his fundamental rights as a people’s representative. Though I do not endorse economic policies of the party who gave political leadership to General Fonseka, I respect his battle to win respect for fundamental human rights, which he believed to be the basis to build a peaceful society free from frequent armed uprisings.
The military court found a window of opportunity on Aug. 13 2010, when Sarath Fonseka’s defense lawyers were on vacation. The court assembled and convicted General Fonseka for engaging in politics while in uniform. Witnesses included a government minister who had recently crossed over to the ruling side. President Mahinda Rajapakse, as the commander-in-chief wasted no time to sign the judgment. Retired General Sarath Fonseka was stripped of all medals of honor, military ranks, and faced a dishonorable discharge of duties. State media was quick to harp on the great victory for President Rajapakse through a fair process of judiciary. However, state media did not question why one of the president’s sons, a Navy officer, was not given the same punishment for getting on the political stage to support his father’s campaign while in uniform. Pardon my ignorance of law applicable to the first family.
In the meantime, a second court martial gave its verdict that Sarath Fonseka is guilty of financial misconduct because he had authorized to purchase several items from a company in which his son-in-law had some interest. Again, President Rajapakse wasted no time to sign the sentence that sends this decorated army commander for rigorous imprisonment for 30 months in the notorious Walikada prison. Though the prime-minister of the country made a statement in the parliament that effectively nullified this allegation, some tragic turn of rule of law took the last privilege Sarath Fonseka had—the status as a member in the parliament—and made him a convicted criminal with compulsory rigorous laborious duties in prison premises.
Civilized world, I wrote this article because I knew you would get to hear this story from various other sources and jump into generalized conclusions about Sri Lankans. One might even say Sri Lankans must be barbarians to send a man who is suffering from severe internal injuries due to two suicide bomb attacks while in duty to defend a country to rigorous imprisonment. Please note that the majority Sri Lankans do not belong to that category. Even after a bitter war with LTTE, most of them supported Sarath Fonseka’s reconciliation agenda. However, here we are, doomed in a vicious feast of a president. The world at large can play their role to do justice to this victimized majority. Please do your part in the most peaceful and democratic way you can think of contributing. We do not need too many Aung Saan Suu Kyi type tragedies, do we?

Save Our Skyline, a recently formed coalition of Cambridge citizens, started a petition last week to block parts of a City Council ordinance that the group says will result in the placement of large corporate signs on the city’s skyline.
The ordinance, passed by a vote of six to three by the Council last Monday, would allow business owners who control at least 25 percent of a building’s leasable space to post signs on its exterior without special permission from the City.
Save Our Skyline says that big landlords and politicians gain from the new ordinance, while putting small businesses at a disadvantage and potentially blighting the Cambridge skyline.
But according to City Councilor Leland Cheung, “[the new ordinance] is actually stricter than before.”
“There is a lot of misinformation out there,” Cheung said, adding that although the previous zoning laws limited the size of signs, the City Council frequently granted exemptions to the rule.
Opponents of the measure contend that big businesses will benefit from the new regulations, by, for example, allowing Microsoft to erect a sign that they say will allow the company to “brand the Cambridge riverfront.”
According to an attorney who has represented Microsoft in the past, the company is not involved in the initiative.
This is “completely untrue,” said James J. Rafferty, who claims Microsoft as one of his clients but does not represent the company in the matter. He called the petition drive by Save Our Skyline a “complete misrepresentation” of what the City Council has decided upon.
If 12 percent of registered voters in Cambridge sign the petition by October 14, the City Council will place a measure on the ballot for voters to decide whether to allow the new regulations to remain in place.
The petition, available online, seeks to prevent a part of the measure that allows more prominent identification of large corporate buildings in the city “that commonly host companies and enterprises that contribute significantly to the city’s economic health and well being” from taking effect. It also opposes language that restricts this right to companies which hold 25 percent of the buildings’ leasable space, which they say disadvantages small businesses.
Previously, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeals had approved signs on an ad-hoc basis. Under that system, the City Council would decide if a business or organization merited a sign larger than the legal restrictions.
According to Karen Schwartzman, spokeswoman for Save our Skyline, the new measure rescinds that process and waives the city’s 20-foot limit for signs on large buildings.
“Public space is sold and no benefit goes back to the citizens,” Schwartzman said.
But under the old system, multiple businesses in Kendall Square erected signs larger than what would be allowed under the new ordinance, Cheung said.

The University announced today that it has received a $10 million gift from industrial magnate Anand G. Mahindra ’77 that will support the Harvard Humanities Center. The gift is the largest in Harvard’s history directed exclusively towards the humanities.
Mahindra’s donation will fund the center’s ongoing programs and the opportunity to expand its reach by strengthening the center’s ties to other cultural institutions, like libraries and museums, and similar organizations across the country, according to English Professor Homi K. Bhabha, director of the center.
“We will be able to think in national and even international terms,” Bhabha said, referring to the possibilities allowed by the donation. “We will be able to use the Humanities Center as a kind of laboratory to think about new ways of teaching and about how the humanities and how culture more generally might be better represented in the well -being of individuals in society.”
The gift will sponsor a variety of lectures, readings, conferences, seminars, and a number of graduate and postdoctoral fellowships, according to a University press release.
“‘New horizons for the humanities’ is our calling for the future at the Humanities Center,” Bhabha said, referring to his role in expanding the humanities at the University.
In honor of the gift, donated in the memory of Mahindra’s mother, the center will be renamed the Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard.
The donation coincides with University President Drew G. Faust’s emphasis on the importance of the humanities on campus.
“[The gift] comes at a time when it is vital to bring a humane and critical perspective to the urgent questions that confront the world,” Faust said in a statement.
Faust has charged a faculty working group with examining the role of the humanities in the curriculum and its broader societal role.
Mahindra has deep ties to the University as a graduate of the College and Harvard Business School. He serves on several University advisory bodies, including the Committee on University Resources and the HBS Board of Dean’s Advisors.
While philanthropic giving has decreased as a result of a slow economy, giving to the University has largely held steady, with Harvard fundraisers recently reporting that the University raised $596 million last fiscal year.

Graphene—a one-atom-thick carbon complex—could be the key to a faster and cheaper method for sequencing DNA, according to a study published by Harvard and MIT researchers that was featured as the cover story in a recent issue of the journal Nature.
The researchers used an electron beam to puncture tiny holes known as nanopores into a graphene membrane. When submerged in an ionic solution, the membrane separates two liquid reservoirs, allowing charged molecules like DNA to traverse through the pores. As the DNA channels through, each base produces a distinct electrical signal.
The researchers were able to detect these signals—a discovery they said gives scientists the ability to decode an entire strand of DNA.
According to the researchers, their findings offer advantages to existing techniques.
Current methods require undertaking multiple reactions that can take hours to complete. The researchers said that their new nanopore technology—which completes sequencing in a single step—can potentially speed up this process, facilitating rapid sequencing of entire genomes.
“One of the long-term goals is to use nanopores for sequencing DNA, and to do that one [must] be able to distinguish one base from the next,” said the study’s senior author, Daniel Branton, who is also an emeritus professor of biology at Harvard and a principal investigator at the Harvard Nanopore Group.
Pore length is crucial when identifying individual DNA bases, Branton said, adding that the study “represents the first time that a molecule—DNA in our case—has been put through a nanopore that is extremely short.”
Scientists in the past have studied protein-based nanopores that span five to 10 nanometers in length. But because the distance between two bases in a DNA molecule is 0.5 nanometers, such pores are ineffective, as they obstruct the resolution of 10 to 15 bases at a time.
In contrast, graphene nanopores—which span a length of 0.5 nanometers—allow a single base to occupy the pore at a time, which resolves this problem.
Branton said that the challenge at this stage is to control the motion of the DNA. Since molecules must move slowly for scientists to detect differences in signal output, the DNA must move even more slowly in order to improve sequencing accuracy, Branton added.
“Our emphasis right now is [on executing] controlled motion of the [DNA] molecule,” Branton said. “There are a lot of interesting features [that] need to be explored so we can enhance or hopefully learn more about how graphene can be used as a sensor.”

The first annual Harvard Cuban-American Alumni Conference held this past weekend, focused on promoting public service and Cuban culture.
The conference titled “A Community of Experiences,” which started on Friday evening and concluded yesterday morning, brought together current and past members of the Cuban-American Undergraduate Students Association at Harvard, to “foster new avenues for service,” according to a press release.
Alumni of both the College and CAUSA, including Harvard Alumni Association President Emeritus Teresita Alvarez-Bjelland ’76 and In-House Council at Huneeus Vinters LLC Suzanne M. Besu ’01, spoke, sharing stories of their past experiences at the College and how they have given back to the community.
“The highlight of the conference, for me, was seeing how much it meant to all of the attendees to be able to return to Harvard by means of a theme which they are all passionate about, service and their culture,” said Daniel Balmori ’11, co-president of CAUSA.
Among the speakers were two of CAUSA’s founders, Cesar Conde ’95 and Carlos A. Zumpano ’96, who started the association in 1994.
Conde and Zumpano shared their story about the organization’s origins, emphasizing that it arose out of concern for deteriorating political situations in Cuba.
Zumpano explained that the two founding goals of CAUSA were to promote Cuban culture and a free and democratic Cuba through a network of students.
Alexander J. Diaz ’14, who attended the conference, said he appreciated this network.
“CAUSA is about the family,” said Diaz. “Leaving home [the family] is the first thing you look for, and CAUSA has provided that with open arms.”
The event also featured Harvard faculty, including Professor of Mexican and Latin American Politics and Economics, Jorge I. Dominguez. Dominguez, who has taught Societies of the World 15: “The Cuban Revolution, 1956-1971: A Self-Debate,” spoke to his work as a scholar in a question-and-answer session.
“The main reason I do the work I do is to figure out how to establish democracy in Cuba that is self-sustaining,” said Dominguez in front of an audience of about forty students and alumni.
Current and past CAUSA members said they hoped this would be the first in a long line of alumni conferences.
“I’m impressed by this event. It demonstrates how far the organization has developed,” said Zumpano. “If this is a sign of the future, [the organization] will be successful.”

In a protest outside the Institute of Politics last Friday, 75 Harvard students urged the Barack Obama administration to pledge $5 billion to fight AIDS at a conference on diseases that is taking place in New York today and tomorrow.
The group of undergraduates and Harvard Medical School students said they were hoping to garner the attention of Secretary of Labor Hilda L. Solis, who spoke at the IOP last Friday.
The Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition (HAC), the Harvard African Students Association, and the Medical School’s Students for Global Health spearheaded the event, according to HAC member Marguerite Thorp ’11.
Krishna M. Prabhu ’11, an HAC member who helped organize the protest, said that the groups had decided to rally during Solis’ event because she was the most influential administration member coming to the University before the conference.
Before her speech, Solis greeted the protestors. Citing the health care reform bill—which was passed in March of this year—the secretary told them that Obama supports global and public health initiatives.
“We’re all on the same side,” she said, “and so is the president.”
Though Prabhu said the protest succeeded in relaying its message to Solis, he added that it was too early to know if the rally was successful.
“Success will come once we find if Solis has talked to President Obama about the issue,” Prabhu said.
Before and after Solis spoke to the crowd, the protestors took turns speaking and participated in chants.
Nancy E. Ringel, a first-year at Harvard Medical School who volunteered in Zambia with the Peace Corps, said that the AIDS epidemic has affected her personally.
“[I had] close friends die because they couldn’t get the treatment they needed,” Ringel said.
“If we can give a trillion-dollar bailout to banks on Wall Street, we should be able to commit $5 billion to fight AIDS,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a speech on Friday addressing the “dignity of working people,” U.S. Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said that her department has launched a new initiative to improve the working conditions of manual laborers and to ensure the strict adherence to safety codes.
That effort, Solis said, grew out of a conversation with family members of the victims of an April mine collapse in Penn. Solis recalled speaking with a grandfather of a 25-year-old victim who had asked her after the release of the news, “Secretary, I’m waiting to hear if my grandson comes out alive.”
“The Department of Labor has really changed,” Solis said. “It’s a new department, it has a new life, we’ve resuscitated it, we’ve incorporated new funding, and we’re helping people get out of the ditch.”
Echoing the Barack Obama administration’s legislative efforts over the past two years, Solis sounded a note of optimism for the potential of legislation to improve the lives of ordinary individuals.
“Politics can be very helpful but also very abusive,” she said.
Solis also paid particular attention in her seminar to the poor economy’s effect on the future availability of jobs and paid internships for college students and recent graduates.
Referring to the lack of jobs open to newly graduated students, Solis stated that “times are very tough, especially for young people.”
Looking back on her own life, Solis addressed her struggle to overcome racial and gender barriers to become the first female Hispanic member of the cabinet.
“It’s inspiring to hear that it’s possible to be taken seriously as an assertive woman,” said Lili C. Behm ’12. “She speaks to how far we’ve come as a country, for a woman of color to hold such an authoritative position.”
With the din of a Global Fund AIDS rally echoing from outside the Institute of Politics, who hosted the speech, President Emeritus of the AFL-CIO John J. Sweeney introduced Solis as a “warrior who stands for working people.”
As Secretary of Labor since 2009, Solis has headed the Department of Labor and established initiatives related to the nation’s level of unemployment, working conditions and wages, and labor union relations during a time of unusual economic turmoil.
“Though the speech was inspiring, it shows how much work is left to be done for labor regulation and how much the administration has to catch up,” said Alexander H. Fernandez, a graduate student at the Kennedy School.
Before assuming her position at the Labor Department, Solis served as a Congresswoman representing a largely Latino district in East Los Angeles.
Reflecting on her roots in California politics, Solis bade her audience, “don’t forget where you come from, don’t forget the people who helped you get there, and give back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While its male counterpart remained at home, the Harvard women’s cross-country team rode solo this past Saturday while competing at the Wisconsin Inter-Regional Invitational. Turns out that some of the country’s top competitors couldn’t stop the Crimson’s shine as the team placed sixth out of 20 teams on the Thomas Zimmer Championship Cross Country Course in Madison, Wis.
“I was really pleased with the results,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was our first time going out to that competition, and it was great to come away beating a couple of nationally-ranked teams.”
“It was a pretty fun meet with some great competition,” senior Claire Richardson said. “It was a good opportunity for the women’s team to get used to a bigger meet setting, and we mixed it up with a lot of people.”
“With so many runners, you want to find your way and just see how you do,” she added.
It didn’t take long for the women to adjust to the longer 6K race and larger field, as the Crimson finished the contest with 157 points, trailing only six behind fifth-place Indiana.
Harvard finished ahead of nationally-ranked Florida (No. 7) and Wisconsin (No. 21).
After the runners stayed together and ran as a pack for the first two miles, Richardson broke away, crossing the line at 20:38 to claim a ninth-place overall finish for the Crimson, about 14 seconds off of the top spot.
She was closely followed by junior Jeanne Mack, who clocked in a time of 20:50 for 24th place.
Sophomore Sammy Silva finished at 20:56 with junior Nicole Cochran crossing the line only two seconds later, good for 36th and 37th place, respectively.
Junior Kailyn Kuzmuk rounded out the top five by turning in a time of 21:15, placing 51st overall.
“This meet was a good stepping stone,” Richardson said. “We all push each other in training to keep improving, and this meet was a great performance. People felt really good, and we were really excited about the day’s results.”
With all of Harvard’s scorers placing within the top quarter of the participating runners, the results not only speak to the team’s improvement, but to the depth and unity within the squad.
“In a smaller race, one person being in front of the other can determine if you win or lose,” Saretsky said. “In a bigger meet, we are able to capitalize on our strength, which is our depth. With all five runners working together and running well, a team can do well in the big-meet setting.”
“We are learning how to work better as a team, which is really important in cross-country,” Richardson added. “There has already been a lot of progress coming in. People are in good shape and are really excited about competing.”
Although each individual is responsible for her own time, runners must count on their teammates to fill out the other scoring positions with strong finishes.
With several important larger meets coming up in the next few weeks, the women used this opportunity to practice establishing their positions and working together as a larger pack in a contest with more competitors.
“We have pre-nationals in Indiana in two weeks, which is a really big race where we see people from all over the nation,” Richardson said. “This race was definitely good experience for bigger meets like that, and it helped us get confidence for this kind of setting.”
But the Crimson squad knows that regardless of the size of the competition, it needs to focus on what it does best and to keep running strong.
“When you are in a bigger setting, the key is to block out all of the things that you can’t control,” Saretsky said. “A bigger field and a bigger crowd ultimately shouldn’t influence how you race.”
“At the end of the day, our sport is about putting one foot in front of the other,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team had a mixed bag of results this weekend as it hosted the Chowder Fest tournament at the Beren Tennis Center where it competed against South Carolina, Minnesota, and Notre Dame.
Because the results from the tournament do not count towards the Crimson’s team record, Harvard used the exhibition to prepare for upcoming events.
“I was encouraged,” said Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72. “I thought last week we were rusty but that we got better through the whole weekend. We just weren’t up to speed last weekend, but we did get better. And then this weekend I thought we played quite well. These teams were all good.”
Junior Alistair Felton stood out in his consistent and dominant play through the weekend. Felton emerged victorious in each of his three singles matches as well as two of his three doubles matches, in which he teamed up with sophomore Andy Nguyen.
“It was a very good outing for Ali,” Fish said. “I was very happy to see him do well.”
Fish also complimented the play of freshman Casey MacMaster. The freshman won his first singles match on Friday, lost in straight sets to Golden Gopher Julian Dehn on Saturday, and dropped a tiebreaker to the Fighting Irish’s Dave Anderson yesterday.
“He played a tough match [Saturday] and was good on Friday indoors,” Fish said. “Yesterday, he played a very good Notre Dame player and split sets with him and lost on the tiebreak. It was probably the best we’ve seen him play.”
Harvard’s top duo this weekend, junior John Pearlman and sophomore Christo Schultz, paired together for the first time for doubles matches. After leading 8-7, the duo lost its first match to the Fighting Irish’s Stephen Havens and Tyler Davis in a tiebreak, 9-8 (7-3). The two showed considerable poise, battling back from down 3-1 to be in a position to win at the end.
“This was our first time playing together, but we definitely had good chemistry,” Pearlman said. “We played very well. Playing tight matches for the first time as a doubles team is very good for us to get comfortable with each other.”
In his singles matches, Schultz lost twice—to Minnesota’s Rok Bonin (6-3, 6-3) on Saturday and Notre Dame’s Greg Andres yesterday (6-2, 7-6).
Fish was encouraged by the sophomore’s performance this weekend.
“He is playing higher than he’s ever played,” the coach said. “He played very competitive matches this weekend, and that’s a really good sign because he’s starting to show he can compete with any of these guys.”
Pearlman lost yesterday to the Fighting Irish’s Steven Havens (6-3, 4-6, 6-2), but defeated the Golden Gopher’s top player, Sebastian Gallego, in three sets (6-2, 6-7, 6-2).
“John’s work ethic is outstanding,” Fish said. “In tennis, you use the term stingy for a guy who doesn’t give up points carelessly. He’s very physically fit. He’s got a strong game, powerful shots. He really has the capacity to wear someone down. I think it’s a great lesson to the other guys on the team about where you can go if you are in great shape.”
“I think the tournament was good, there was a very high level of play,” Pearlman added. “It tested the team to play the highest level possible. It’s really good for the guys in terms of preparation for regionals next week. The team played well as a whole—there was very good energy.”
Fish was unconcerned about captain Aba Omodele-Lucien’s injury, which kept him out of action in this weekend’s Chowder Fest.
“We were just being careful about an arm that was sore from serving too much last weekend,” Fish said. “He just had played an awful lot of tennis.”
Although Notre Dame held the best results on the weekend, Fish thinks this experience will help the Crimson in the future.
“When you get a chance to see better players the guys don’t do as well, so they know what they have to work on, or they surprise themselves and realize they are not that far off,” he said. “I didn’t see anyone not putting energy into the tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The season-long offensive struggles for Harvard field hockey continued yesterday, as the squad fell, 3-0, to Bucknell at home.
With the loss, the Crimson (3-7, 1-2 Ivy) continued a streak of eight straight games without scoring more than two goals. Harvard is 1-7 in that span and has been shut out four times.
The Bison (5-6, 1-0 Patriot) finished off a Harvard weekend sweep, handing the Crimson its second loss in as many days. The Crimson lost to Brown on Saturday in double overtime.
“We really did try to wipe a clean slate [from the Brown game] and just focus on today,” sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “I think we did a good job of doing that. It was a hard game [Saturday], but we came out here with a positive attitude.”
In spite of the team’s defeat the day prior, Harvard controlled the game early, maintaining much of the possession at the opening.
“First 20 minutes of the game, we played very strong and controlled the game,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “The two teams were very evenly matched. I think we complemented each other’s style of play very well.”
But the momentum swung rapidly late in the first half. Bucknell scored twice in a three-minute span—once on a decoy-pass play on a penalty corner that seemed to throw Harvard’s defense off-guard—to open up a two goal lead with a little more than 10 minutes left in the half.
“They have very fast forwards, and sometimes they were just getting in behind us,” Tassopoulos said. “They scored on the corner, which was a good goal, and they scored on an uncontested shot. These are just simple things...that turn into goals, and that’s what shows up on the scoreboard.”
The Crimson was never able to regain the composure it had shown early in the afternoon after giving up the two first-half goals. The team managed eight shots, only one of which was on goal. Of the Bison’s 13 shots, eight were on goal.
“They created some good goal scoring opportunities and capitalized, and we can’t get back on our heels,” Caples said.
In the second half, Bucknell had five of its eight shots on goal and rarely lost possession. Harvard did manage five shots in the half, but all were off-target.
“Something that we have to focus on is [to] keep getting shots and keep getting the ball on the goal,” Tassopoulos said.
Caples emphasized the youth of a team that has struggled all year to score or even take many shots on goal once it has fallen behind. The Crimson has not won a game in which it has trailed this season, though it did come back against Brown on Saturday to force overtime.
“We’re a little bit young, and we have to learn how to respond to being scored against,” the coach said. “We need to be a little bit more mentally tough, and we need to be more disciplined with executing the small details.”
Freshman Rachael Rosenfeld played 57 minutes of the game as a substitute, and of the four substitutes the team used, three were freshmen. Eight underclassmen started the game—four freshmen and four sophomores. Chloe Keating was the only senior to take the field at all yesterday.
Tassopoulos again allowed fewer than five goals, a streak that dates back to late last season. She has played every minute of the season so far.
For the second week in a row, the Crimson played one game at home and one on the road, uncommon for Ivy League scheduling. But Caples noted that the more difficult challenge for the team was the strategic adjustment between opponents.
“[Saturday’s] game was nothing like [yesterday’s] game—different style, tactically, and the game was much different. We’ve had two weeks in a row where we’ve had to change tactically,” she said.

The Harvard women’s field hockey team lost for the second time in double overtime, this time to Ivy League rival Brown (2-6, 1-2 Ivy) on Saturday at Warner Roof. Despite a huge Crimson comeback in the second half, where Harvard (3-6, 1-2 Ivy) evened the score at two all, the Bears’ junior Abigail Taft sealed the victory with a game winner in the 98th minute.
“It was definitely a hard loss,” sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos said. “But we played very well today because [although] they scored two goals on us in the first half, we were able to come back and really push through [while] still playing a really aggressive style.”
Taft was solid all game, scoring her first goal 18 minutes into the contest to give Brown the lead in the first half. But it was her second goal that was the deciding factor; in the 98th minute, Taft received a pass from sophomore teammate Kelly Harrison and put the ball into the back of the Crimson net. The game was just three minutes shy of going into penalty strokes.
“They got a fast break away,” sophomore Kim Goh said. “There was a little bit of a breakdown in front of our goal. A lot of the people on the team thought that there were a flurry of fouls, but you play the game with what you are given.”
While Harvard started off the game strong, outshooting the Bears, 4-3, in the first half, the offense was not able to capitalize on those opportunities, only forcing junior goalie Lauren Kessler to make one save on net. Instead, Brown took advantage of the counterattack chances created by the Crimson offense, and scored twice within the span of four minutes.
After Taft produced her first goal through a penalty corner, redirecting senior Katie Hyland’s shot from the top of the circle into the back of the net, the Bears got another score in a goal-line scramble.
This time, Brown senior Tacy Zysk took a deflection and put the ball into the right side of the Harvard net, giving the Bears a 2-0 lead.
“The two goals that happened off penalty corners were a wake-up call,” Tassopoulos said. “At halftime, we really wanted to focus on getting aggressive and digging ourselves out of a hole.”
The Crimson came out in the second half with cleaner passes and better shot selection, producing two goals of its own in the span of three minutes. Harvard outshot Brown, 8-6, in the second half, with its first goal coming in the 16th minute of the half from sophomore Katelin Wahl, who got the rebound from a blocked shot and put the Crimson on the board, 2-1.
Just three minutes later, Harvard took advantage of a defensive lapse by the Bears and scored on a three-on-one break. Junior captain Carly Dixon led the break with a shot on goal, which was deflected by Kessler. Senior Chloe Keating buried the rebound to score a team-high fifth goal of the season, evening the score at 2-2.
Just as Brown did in the first half, the Crimson cooled down after the second score. The game became a defensive struggle for the rest of the second half and the first overtime.
“Our defense is one of our strongest points,” Goh said. “We have really solid players and a really good understanding of what we need to do in order to be successful either in counter attacking or supporting each other around the ball. We were working as a defensive unit, and that was definitely one of the things that helped us back in the second half. Disciplined defense and knowledge of the structure.”
Harvard produced the first three shots of the first overtime but failed to score. Brown then responded with four consecutive shots, forcing Tassopoulos to make three saves.
“Overtime is very hard,” Tassopoulos said. “You are playing six-on-six on a full field; it’s kind of like whoever can get a breakaway or a good shot. We had some chances, which were good, but their goalie played outstanding. When you play second overtime, everyone is tired and putting their all into it.”
Heading into the second extra period, the weary Crimson nevertheless put up a string of good runs, forcing three penalty corners that produced two shots on goal. But in the end, it was Taft’s shot that ended the game, and resulted in another heart-breaking defeat for Harvard.

After ending a seven-match losing streak its last time out, the Harvard women’s volleyball team took the floor at the Malkin Athletic Center last Friday night looking to avenge the loss to Ivy League rival Dartmouth earlier this season. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the home-court advantage was not enough to tip the scales in favor of Harvard (3-11, 0-2 Ivy) as the Big Green (11-2, 2-0) took the win in four sets.
“It was a tough loss,” said junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll. “We went up to their house last week and lost, so we came in hungry for a win against them. We were so pumped up for this game on our floor and had the chance to get back at them for last time, but we just couldn’t finish them off.”
“We didn’t come out and play with the same intensity as our last game,” junior libero Christine Wu added.
The first set was a back-and-forth affair in which Harvard started the night strong with some very clean play, committing only two attack errors. It remained within striking distance of Dartmouth for the entire set, rallying twice from five- and four-point deficits, respectively, until the score reached 21-19 in favor of the Big Green. But the hitting errors came at an inopportune time, as Harvard’s comeback stalled and kills from Dartmouth junior Madeline Baird and senior Kelsey Johnson gave the visitors the opening set victory, 25-20.
In the second set, the Big Green raced to an early 12-4 lead. Harvard managed to find a spark of energy on kills from Ingersoll and freshman Erin Cooney. Several blocks from Ingersoll and freshman Teresa Skelly catalyzed an 11-4 run for the Crimson, but that would be the closest that Harvard would get. Nine of the next 10 points would be in Dartmouth’s favor, and the Big Green went on to claim the set, 25-16.
“When we won last time out [against UNH on Tuesday], we were full of energy,” Ingersoll said. “We celebrated every single block, every single kill, and used that to fuel us to play even better. We had some decent moments [Friday], but overall, that energy wasn’t there for us. It’s hard to rally from behind, and it takes a lot out of you as a player, especially when you can’t finish the comeback.”
The Crimson showed signs of life in the third frame, as Harvard would maintain the lead for most of the set, but Dartmouth pushed the home team to its limits. Whenever the Crimson regained the lead and attempt to widen the gap, the Big Green came storming back. With the score tied at 20, the momentum started shifting towards Dartmouth’s side. But Harvard was able to fend off the Big Green attack with a key block from Skelly and Ingersoll. After two clutch kills from the junior co-captain, including the decisive set winner, the Crimson took the frame, 25-22.
“The third set was definitely the high point of our night,” Ingersoll said. “We weren’t going to go down without a fight. Everything they gave us, we threw right back at them even harder. Everyone was pumped up, and we found that energy we were missing. We finally got into our rhythm.”
“Things finally clicked for us,” Wu added. “We got a tough win out of that third set and thought that would give us the momentum for the rest of the night, but it just didn’t happen for us.”
In the final set, Dartmouth took an early 9-4 lead and never looked back. Despite solid performances from sophomore Taylor Docter, Skelly, and Cooney down the stretch, the Big Green was able to push the lead to 24-13. A service error would end the night for Harvard, as it lost the set, 25-16, and the match, 3-1.
On the stat sheet, Ingersoll led the team with 10 kills and three blocks. Skelly added eight kills of her own and chipped in a team-high four blocks. Wu added 15 digs, while assist-leaders sophomore Beth Kinsella and rookie Natalie Doyle had 16 and 12 helpers, respectively. As a team, the Crimson had a .192 hitting percentage but was relatively error-free, tallying only 12. Both of Harvard’s conference losses this season have come against Dartmouth, which has won its last four matchups with the Crimson.
“[The loss] is going to push us,” Ingersoll said. “We’re going to work harder and play harder. We’re going to come out and win.”

The Macdonald Cup might not have the same ring as The Game, but every fall Yale plays host to the Harvard men’s golf team and 11 other schools on its home turf, The Course at Yale.
The Crimson arrived in New Haven, Conn., on Saturday coming off a disappointing seventh-place finish in The McLaughlin last weekend in which it shot a team-record three-round score of 856 strokes. At the end of this weekend’s two-round tournament, Harvard was in a familiar place—seventh—after shooting a 588, one stroke more than Ivy counterpart Dartmouth and eight shots worse than the rival Bulldogs.
“We had a good start,” junior captain Tony Grillo said. “[But] golf is just like any other sport: one day can change anything. That happened [yesterday]. We’re definitely disappointed in our finish, but we have nothing to blame but ourselves.”
It could be tempting to blame The Course. Designed by USGA co-founder Charles Blair Macdonald in 1926, The Course at Yale was named the top college golf course in the country by Golfweek and was deemed the 71st-most difficult course in the world by Golf Magazine in 1988.
“A lot of emphasis is based on how hard it is around the greens,” Grillo said. “Especially when the greens are a little faster...they definitely tend to trip people up.”
The greens did not trip up freshman Theo Lederhausen. Lederhausen fired a one under par, 69, on Saturday, and on his first shot yesterday bypassed the green altogether. Teeing off on the fifth hole—a 147-yard, par three—to start the round, the freshman sunk a hole-in-one. From there, Lederhausen cruised, carding a team-best 71 on the day to finish the tournament with an even-par 140, good enough to tie for fifth place out of 74 competitors.
“We are thrilled with his play,” Grillo said of the freshman. “We are excited to see that he’s playing well. I think the most important part is he’s feeling comfortable now.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, no one else could match Lederhausen’s success. Grillo finished second on the team and tied for 18th overall by shooting six over par (71-75). Junior Mark Pollak posted Harvard’s third-best score at 11 over par (75-76), and junior Connor Wentzell rounded out the top four with 14 over par (78-76).
Freshmen Seiji Liu and Michael Lai also competed, scoring a 155 (75-80) and 156 (78-78), respectively.
“We just couldn’t put scores together,” Grillo said. “When we had a couple low scores, we had some high scores we had to take.”
Although the Crimson led both Dartmouth and Yale after the first round, both the Big Green and the Bulldogs took advantage of Harvard’s inconsistency and edged past the Crimson on the leaderboard.
Not helping matters, cold weather, high winds, and difficult pin placements made Harvard especially susceptible to the rallying Ivies.
“It was extremely cold weather—around high 40s and low 50s for most of the day,” Liu said. “The wind was about 20 miles an hour...Add [that] on to tough pin positions and an already wet and drenched course.”
Dartmouth’s Sunday score of 292 gave the Big Green 587 strokes on the tournament and a share of fifth place. Yale, led by sophomore Bradley Kushner’s three over par, collectively shot a 580, 20 over par—good for second place.
“That’s [the Bulldogs’] home course,” Liu said. “So they had a major advantage.”
“Yale has beaten us the last couple times out. Of course we’re gunning for them,” Grillo said. ”As far as Dartmouth beating us, we just had a bad day [yesterday]. We’d like to consider ourselves better than that team.”
Topping the Bulldogs for first place in The Macdonald Cup was St. John’s. The Red Storm dominated the competition, shooting five over par as a team and winning by 15 strokes. St. John’s players posted four of the top nine individual scores. The Bulldogs, Binghamton, Central Connecticut, and Sacred Heart rounded out the top five.
“We have to piece together stronger rounds from all five of us on the same days,” Liu said.
“Two seventh-place finishes in [The McLaughlin and The Macdonald Cup] is not bad. It’s nothing to be disappointed and hang our heads about,” Grillo said. “But at the same time, we’re looking to start winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decision was made last Sunday morning—with senior Andrew Hatch sidelined, untested sophomore Colton Chapple would get the starting nod at quarterback. Throw in a knee injury to senior wideout Chris Lorditch, and, even against a weak Lafayette team, Chapple faced a daunting task. But with his team desperate for a win following its pummeling at the hands of Brown, the sophomore signal caller did what was asked of him—and more—to propel the Crimson to victory Saturday.
“Being a backup, you always have to be ready, you always have to prepare like you’re the starter,” Chapple said. “In this case, I was fortunate enough to start my first game, so I just wanted to come in, be productive, not turn the ball over, and give the offense a chance to win the game.”
From the outset, it was clear the sophomore would not be shouldered with the offensive burden that Hatch carries. With a dominant run game and the offensive line returning to form, the young quarterback rarely took the chance to throw. Instead, with Crimson coach Tim Murphy emphasizing ball security, Chapple attempted just 11 passes, completing six for 82 yards, including a nine-yard touchdown strike to sophomore Kyle Juszczyk in the second quarter. The throw on a rollout was Chapple’s first career score.
But most importantly, the sophomore managed to calm his nerves to play mistake-free football all game, as the Crimson didn’t turn the ball over once after three giveaways last week.
“[I was] probably [feeling] more nerves than pressure,” Chapple said. “You come to Harvard to play college football—I was real excited, real nervous. But pressure, no.”
HATCH’S HEAD
Of course, Chapple was in position to start largely because of the helmet-to-helmet impact Hatch endured when Brown’s Stephen Peyton crunched him on his first play from scrimmage last week. The quarterback finished that contest despite suffering a concussion, and even on film it was clear just how much the hit took out of him.
“The shot [Hatch] took—first of all, I can’t believe it wasn’t a penalty. It was one of the worst helmet-to-helmet hits i’ve ever seen on video tape,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “That happened so hard, so I ran it back like 20 times. I couldn’t believe it, and I couldn’t believe he got up.”
Unfortunately for Hatch, the toughness that kept him in the game against the Bears will do nothing to speed up his recovery. With concussion regulations more stringent than ever, the Crimson will undoubtedly take every precaution before letting its starter return to the field, but Murphy appeared confident that the team’s outlook included Hatch.
“[A new quarterback] changed [the game plan] today, but it’s not going to change in the long run,” the coach said.
In other words, Harvard very much expects its senior starter back on the field in due time.
DIRTY LAUNDRY
While Harvard seemed to need little help during its dominant performance, the Leopards provided plenty by shooting themselves in the foot. Lafayette racked up 10 penalties for 109 yards, and they always seemed to come at inopportune moments.
In the second quarter, following a holding penalty on a punt return that pushed the Leopards back to their own 10-yard line, the home team managed to dig itself an even deeper hole with back-to-back infractions. A false start penalty on second down moved the ball back to the seven, and Lafayette could not regroup in time to avoid a delay of game.
“They looked a little like we did last week, quite frankly,” Murphy said. “And it’s tough. Sometimes you just get on a negative roll, [and] it’s hard to undo yourself.”
Indeed, things only got worse for the Leopards, who even managed to pick up a facemask and personal foul penalty on the same play to move Harvard all the way from the Lafayette 44 to the 14 in the third quarter. Just five minutes later the Leopards set the Crimson up for its final score of the afternoon, bailing out a stalled drive by roughing sophomore punter Jacob Dombrowski to give Harvard a first down. Sophomore Rich Zajeski took advantage by powering into the endzone for his first career touchdown.
Tavani’s frustration peaked on the very next play, when Jet Kollie’s 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown was called back for an illegal block. The normally-reserved head coach exploded at the officiating crew, running onto the field to plead his case.
“There’s no question, I certainly lost my poise at that point,” Tavani said. “The frustration just came out...To have a kid make a great play like that and get that call away from the play, I just at that point had had enough, and rather than hold it in and have a stroke, I let it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not easy to bounce back from a quadruple-overtime loss to a league opponent.
But the Harvard men’s water polo team overcame the challenge. Keyed by a strong defensive effort, the Crimson (4-8, 0-2 CWPA North) defeated MIT (5-3, 2-0), 10-8, at Blodgett Pool on Saturday in a matchup that did not count towards conference standings.
In the process, Harvard avenged its loss to the Engineers earlier in the season.
“Last week, the game against Iona...that stung a lot,” junior Mike Katzer said. “MIT I would say probably is our biggest rival...it felt really good to get this win for us.”
The contest represents the 90th matchup between the two squads, with the Crimson having beaten the Engineers 73 times.
Of late, the matches have been close. In 16 of the last 18 meetings, the winning team has prevailed by a margin of three goals or less.
The first contest earlier this season typified the tough battles between the two Cambridge teams. Down 5-0 at halftime, Harvard fought back, tying the game at 6-6 before giving up what proved to be the deciding goal with just minutes left in regulation.
Saturday’s match seemed to be headed in the same direction after MIT scored within the first four minutes of the first period. But the Crimson answered, scoring two goals in the next three minutes. Harvard did not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game.
The Crimson added eight goals in the second and third periods, while the Engineers found the back of the net only five more times.
Entering the final period down four goals, MIT mounted a late charge, scoring twice. Nevertheless, Harvard held on to win by a two-goal margin.
The Crimson defense played a key role in the victory, stifling the Engineers’ front line for much of the game. Junior co-captain Luka Babic and senior Alex Thompson led the team with four steals.
“We made it tough for them to move the ball,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We made it tough for them to get the ball where they wanted to get it, and that’s the key. That’s how I want to play, and the guys are doing that.”
“I think today was a total team defensive effort,” Katzer added. “The major thing about water polo is everyone feeds off each other’s energy. You look into your teammates’ eyes, and everyone’s up in the lanes pressing hard, and it just gets you going.”
Junior goalkeeper Alexandre Popp once again led Harvard’s defensive effort. After tallying 21 saves in the team’s quadruple-overtime loss against Iona, Popp added seven more against MIT, bringing his season total to 103.
“[Popp] had a great game for us,” Katzer said. “As a player in the field, you feed a lot off your goalie. He makes a big block, he gets you up, and you’re going to be countering that much harder.”
In addition to his goal-saving, Popp had a number of superb passes and was able to set up key offensive plays on counterattacks. His two assists were the second-most for the Crimson on Saturday.
“Popp had some great dishes this morning,” Katzer said. “He can definitely pass the ball.”
On the offensive side, Katzer led Harvard, earning his second hat trick in as many games. In the past two matches, Katzer has increased his season goal total to eight.
“Mike played really well,” co-captain Bret Voith said. “He really found his shot offensively and had a couple really timely goals for us.”
“Katzer is Katzer,” Minnis added. “He played on both ends of the pool, and that’s something we’ve talked about...I was proud of the way he played.”
While the match had no conference implications, the victory was certainly important for the team’s psyche, especially considering that the Crimson will face a number of strong teams in the upcoming Claremont Convergence Tournament in Southern California.
“After starting out our conference 0-2, it’s good to get a big win over our cross-town rival and give us momentum going into California next week,” Voith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Backed up on its own 26-yard line on third down, the Harvard football team needed 15 yards for a first.
Gino Gordon gave it 74 and a touchdown.
The senior tailback ran to the right side of the field, where sophomore guard John Collins and senior right tackle Brent Osborne had carved out a hole, before cutting all the way back to the left, where he escaped one last Lafayette defender, a safety, and sprinted untouched into the endzone.
The senior’s touchdown, his second of the game, epitomized what Saturday meant for the Crimson running backs and the offensive line that opened up the field for them: they needed to make noise and performed a symphony.
The entire contest against Lafayette was kind of like a third-and-15 for Harvard’s ground game, which seemed to take some steps backwards against Holy Cross and in last week’s 29-14 loss to Brown. And just like Gordon’s run, Harvard’s running backs did more than was necessary at the time.
“[In] the Brown game...they kind of took it to us and kind of beat us up a little bit,” Gordon said. “We kind of wanted to come into this game and prove not only to our coaches but to ourselves that we can still be a physical team, and that we can assert the run.”
The Crimson’s trio of running backs took it a step further, posting 311 yards on the ground for Harvard’s highest rushing total since 2008.
All three backs found the endzone, but Gordon led the way with 170 yards on 12 carries for an average of 14.2 yards per carry. His 74-yard run was the longest since Clifton Dawson ’07 put up a 74-yarder of his own against Dartmouth in 2006.
“Typical Gino in this respect,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “Since the day Gino walked in here four years ago, he’s been extraordinarily reliable and productive, even as a freshman. He’s just one of those kids you can always depend on—makes great decisions, great leadership, a complete player in that he’s a great blocker and a great receiver as well as an outstanding ballcarrier. You know, he makes our job easier as coaches.”
But Gordon’s performance was far from a one-man show. His offensive line kept the Leopard defensive line from being a factor in the game. When the Crimson rested Gordon after his second touchdown, sophomore Rich Zajeski stepped in without missing a beat, rushing for 59 yards on 11 carries with one touchdown and a long of 23. Not to be left out, sophomore running back Treavor Scales ran for 37 yards on eight carries and managed to make a trip to the endzone himself, a five yard run with 3:20 left in the second quarter. Meanwhile, senior wide receiver Mike Cook actually had the highest yards-per-carry with 16.5. Cook had 33 yards on two carries, both on endarounds. Cook wasn’t the only wideout to run the football; classmate Marco Iannuzzi ran for 10 yards on the second play of the game. And for sophomore quarterback Colton Chapple, the extra time and protection took off some of the pressure of making his first start for Harvard.
“Our offensive line—I just want to mention them by name, [senior] Chris LeRoy, [sophomore] John Collins, [senior] Brent Osborne, we’ve got [junior Kevin Murphy], and [senior] Matt Bush—they just did a great job protecting me, opening holes for the running backs,” he said. “The game really went to those guys. They controlled the line of scrimmage all game.”
Continued dominance by the running backs and the offensive line will be essential down the road. When the Crimson knocked off an easy 34-6 victory over Holy Cross in the season opener, it seemed hard to imagine that Harvard would be unprepared for a league game—certainly not as unprepared as the team was against the Bears. Perhaps the Crimson’s passing game went too well against the Crusaders—Harvard hardly seemed to need a running game.
But the loss to Brown and losing starting senior quarterback Andrew Hatch was a wake-up call.
If Hatch can come back strong, the reinvigoration of the running game may give the Crimson that balanced attack it will need in tough Ivy matches against teams like Penn.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A team that’s accustomed to winning, the Harvard women’s golf team found itself in unfamiliar territory when it did not finish in the top half of competitors in its first two tournaments of the season. Much to the Crimson’s relief, the downward trend turned out to be just a short detour.
On its trip to Pennsylvania this weekend, Harvard found its way back to the top tier, finishing tied for fourth at the Nittany Lion Women’s Invitational in its first year participating in the tournament.
“I think we showed definite improvement over our last two starts,” captain Mia Kabasakalis said. “We had a rockier start than we have had in the past. It was good to have everyone shoot the scores we know we can shoot.”
After a team score of 309 put the Crimson in sixth after the first round, Harvard posted a score of 297 in the second round and moved into a tie for fourth with William and Mary by the end of Saturday.
The third and final round, which took place yesterday, did not separate the Crimson from the Tribe. Both squads notched a 307 to remain tied for fourth.
“We got off to a not-so-good start,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “The 297 was a good second round. I was pleased with how we played.”
In that round, Harvard’s top four golfers all shot below 80. Kabasakalis and freshman Bonnie Hu both shot scores of 73 to lead the team.
For Hu, the 73 was the highlight of a sixth-place individual finish. The rookie posted a 74 in the first round and a 75 in the final round.
“I felt like I played pretty well,” Hu said. “I hit a lot of fairways and greens in general.”
Hu describe the course as long, but the length seemed to play into her hands. The freshman was strong enough to get onto the green with few shots, giving her room to breathe with her putter.
“She played very well,” Rhoads added. “I’d say her [scores] could’ve been even lower.  She hit the majority of the greens [early]. She had a lot of birdie cuts that were hit correctly, hit well, but didn’t go in.”
Perhaps Rhoads was thinking about the birdies that might have been because the second- through sixth-place teams finished within four shots of each other.
Had three of Hu’s unlucky putts gone her way, the Crimson would have finished tied for second with Western Michigan University. Just one fewer shot would have put Harvard tied for third with Rollins.
But while it let the Broncos and the Tars slip out of its grasp, the Crimson may have won the close battle that meant the most to it, topping Yale by a single stroke. Harvard beat the other Ivy League school, Columbia, by 29 strokes. The Lions finished 12th overall.
“It’s certainly good to be the top Ivy school,” Rhoads said. “And yet we want to be better.”
The other Lions, the Nittany ones from Penn State, took the overall lead after the first round and never looked back.
The team won its home tournament by nine strokes, led by Emily Ransone who finished second overall.
Rollins’s Fabia Rothenfluh was the overall winner.
Kabasakalis and junior Christine Cho finished tied for 21st, a score they shared with Penn State’s Giulia Carando.
“Mia hit[ting] 73 in the second round [is] representative of the way her game is going,” Rhoads said.
Sophomore Katie Sylvan, who placed 37th, was next in line, followed by junior Jane Lee, who wound up tied for 57th.
All five of the Crimson’s golfers placed in the top four for Harvard at least once, meaning that the performances of all five factored into the top-five finish this weekend.
Harvard will rely on that kind of depth in two weeks when it hosts its final fall tournament at The International in Bolton, Mass.
“It was good to see what we’re capable of,” Kabasakalis said. “Well, we’re capable of doing better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EASTON, Pa.—Football is often a game of inches. For Harvard this season, every game has been won or lost by a mile.
After being embarrassed at Brown last weekend, the Crimson (2-1, 0-1 Ivy) got its season back on track on Saturday, running Lafayette (0-4, 0-1 Patriot) into the ground in a dominating 35-10 win at Fisher Stadium.
“I’m just very proud of our kids,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “We just really appealed to our kids’ pride today, and they responded tremendously from the get-go.”
Without the arm of senior quarterback Andrew Hatch, who missed the game due to a concussion, Harvard turned to the legs of senior Gino Gordon. Gordon responded with a 170-yard rushing performance, accounting for more than half of the Crimson’s 311 yards on the ground. The last time the Leopards gave up 300-plus yards on the ground was in a 34-27 loss to Harvard in 2003.
“We needed to establish the run for a lot of different reasons,” Murphy said. “We’ll go back to being a balanced offense. We weren’t a balanced offense last week, we weren’t a balanced offense today, but we had the right type of non-balance today.”
Senior Marco Iannuzzi got the game off to a good start with a 50-yard kickoff return, putting sophomore Colton Chapple into Lafayette territory for his first drive as a starting quarterback.
Chapple directed a 46-yard rushing drive—including a 30-yard carry from senior wideout Mike Cook—that ended with Gordon darting into the endzone with a two-yard run.
“One of the keys to this game was getting off to a great start,” Murphy said. “Whatever team got off to a great start was going to have an edge. We rode that momentum, and we were fortunate to keep it going.”
The Crimson padded that lead with a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter. The first came on Chapple’s first career touchdown pass—a nine-yard completion to sophomore tight end Kyle Juszczyk—and the second on a five-yard run from sophomore Treavor Scales, a score set up by a 27-yard rush from Gordon.
But just as Harvard’s offense got on a roll in the first half, so did its defense. The Crimson allowed just one score in the first half, coming on a 45-yard field goal from Leopard kicker Davis Rodriguez with 33 seconds left in the half.
“Certainly not our best game by any stretch of the imagination,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “We took a huge step backwards. Obviously we weren’t prepared, and it starts with me, so I’ll shoulder the blame for that. It was pretty much the first time all year I was kind of embarrassed by our play.”
Chapple ended the half with his longest completion of the game, a 45-yard Hail Mary bomb that was improbably hauled in by Cook at the one-yard line as time expired.
The Crimson then capitalized on its first possession after the break, with Gordon breaking for the longest rush of his career—a 74-yard touchdown run to make the score 28-3.
“You get to think about quite a few things when you’re making a run like that,” Gordon said. “The main one for me was don’t get caught and make sure you celebrate with the offensive line.”
With the game already in hand, Murphy gave some fresh faces a chance to play. Sophomore Rich Zajeski got in on the fun late in the third quarter, first darting through the defense with a 23-yard run and capping the drive with a one-yard score on the next play. Zajeski finished with a career-high 59 yards and his first collegiate touchdown.
Senior Matt Simpson—a backup QB last season who had been converted to a wide receiver—took snaps in the fourth quarter, completing his first career pass to freshman Scott Miller. All told, five rookies saw action.
In garbage time late in the game, Lafayette got into a groove. Leopard rookie Jet Kollie looked to have a 94-yard kickoff return for a touchdown following Zajeski’s score, but the play was called back on an illegal block penalty—one that drew the ire of Tavani, who rushed the field to express his displeasure.
Lafayette backup quarterback Andrew Shoop found Greg Kessel in the endzone for an 18-yard touchdown with five minutes to play in the fourth, making the final score 35-10.
With the win, Harvard moves to 2-0 on the season against Patriot League opponents, a year after going 1-2 against those same nonconference foes. The Crimson has a chance to make a clean Patriot sweep when it hosts Lehigh in two weeks.
“We know [Lafayette’s] struggling, btu we were kind of struggling coming in,” Murphy said. “They’ve got a really outstanding program...You go 3-0 against the Patriot League, you know you’re a very good football team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team had a simple motto heading into its second Ivy League contest of the year: “Whatever it takes.”
After losing its Ivy League opener to Penn last weekend, the Crimson knew it needed to come up with a victory—in any way possible—if it wanted to keep its hopes of winning a third straight Ivy League championship alive.
Taking on Yale Saturday afternoon at Ohiri Field, the Crimson managed to keep a league championship within reach, fighting and scrapping its way to a 2-1 victory.
Heading into the 2010 season, few could have predicted that Harvard (4-4-1, 1-1 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (3-6-1, 0-2 Ivy)—last season’s first and second place Ivy League finishers, respectively—would enter the contest winless in conference play and need a win to keep their seasons alive.
“[Both teams knew] their backs were against the wall, and that’s how both teams played,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “There was great emotion.”
Harvard managed to come out on top in the gritty contest, relying on scores from co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh and sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro and seven saves from freshman goalie Jessica Wright to earn the win.
“It went really well,” said Conigliaro, who scored her first career goal on a penalty kick in the 57th minute. “I think everybody did everything they could to get the win.”
After Conigliaro’s score gave the Crimson the 2-0 lead, it looked like Harvard may cruise to the easy victory and give Wright her first collegiate shutout.
But the Bulldogs did not go down without a fight. After the team’s first 21 shot attempts were off their mark, Yale managed to find the back of the net on its 22nd, pulling within one goal in the 88th minute.
With less than three minutes on the clock, the Bulldogs scrambled to net the equalizer, but the Crimson’s defense—which had slowed Yale’s offense for the majority of the game—came up big one last time and successfully defended against a corner kick in the final minute to secure the win.
Crucial to Harvard’s defensive strategy was stopping Yale forward Becky Brown, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year. While Brown has been held to just three goals this season, Leone and the Crimson defense were well aware of her scoring prowess after she notched a goal against Harvard in 2009.
“She’s a phenomenal player,” Leone said. “She has just run havoc on us for four years, and I have a lot of respect for her, so we just defend her together. That’s the only thing we can do.”
The strategy paid off, as the forward was held scoreless despite taking a team-high five shots. The Bulldogs found Brown in the box in the early going, but her first shot sailed wide right and her second attempt was deflected by freshman defender Claudia Haeussler.
The Crimson struggled to get a good look at the net in the game’s opening minutes, but the squad earned its first corner kick in the 14th minute and capitalized on the opportunity.
Freshman Peyton Johnson took the corner, crossing it in front of the Yale net to freshman forward Elizabeth Weisman, who then headed the ball high into the air. Sheeleigh connected with the ball before it could hit the ground and fired it past Yale goalie Ayana Sumiyasu to put her team up, 1-0.
The score marked the 27th of Sheeleigh’s career, putting her just one goal behind Joey Yenne ’03 for fifth all-time in Harvard history.
“I can’t say enough about what [Sheeleigh] brings to the team,” Leone said. “She showed it again today.”
The Bulldogs had an opportunity to even the score with five minutes left in the first half after Harvard turned it over in front of its own goal, but a shot from point-blank range sailed wide, preserving the Crimson’s lead heading into the break.
Harvard had a number of opportunities to extend its lead early in the second, but the team could not capitalize.
Conigliaro provided the cushion the Crimson needed in the 57th minute after she was fouled inside the box and awarded a penalty kick.
“[Before I took the shot], I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, I have to score this goal,’” Conigliaro said.
While Conigliaro may have been nervous, she appeared unfazed, booting the ball into the bottom right corner of the cage to put Harvard ahead, 2-0.
The Crimson withstood the late Yale surge—led by Mary Kubiuk, who accounted for the Bulldog’s lone score—to hang on to its first Ancient Eight win of the season.
“We definitely needed this win to give us momentum for the rest of the Ivy League season,” Conigliaro said. “Hopefully this will propel us forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team can finally breathe a sigh of relief.
The Crimson (3-3-3, 1-0 Ivy) earned a much-needed win against Ivy League rivals Yale (1-8-1, 0-1 Ivy) to restore some of the confidence the squad had had at the beginning of the season. Even though Harvard could only come up with one goal, it was sufficient, as a strong defensive display denied Yale of finding the equalizer. The Saturday afternoon match at Ohiri Field also marked the first victory in Ivy League play for first-year Harvard head coach Carl Junot.
“It was a full team effort,” Junot said. “I think in all honesty because we hadn’t won in a while we might’ve played a little nervous, but I actually thought that produced some of the best defensive play we’ve had.”
The match was played in perfect conditions, with the wind at a minimum and the sun lightly heating up the pitch. The Crimson set out to match the weather by starting conference play with a perfect record, and it did just that.
Harvard attained the lone score of the match in the first half thanks to an accurate aerial pass from co-captain Jaren LaGreca that found the head of sophomore Scott Prozeller. With 14:39 left in the period, Prozeller’s header brought Harvard to life and set the tone of an otherwise-tame first half.
The Crimson kept pushing the Bulldogs to the limit, often using the quickness and ability of sophomore Brian Rogers against a slow-moving Yale backline. Freshman forward Connor McCarthy also tormented the Bulldogs with his pace.
About a minute after the score, Harvard was looking for more as a long ball to Rogers resulted in a footrace between the sophomore forward and the last Bulldog defender. Rogers got the edge, but the defender didn’t allow the play to continue, tripping him up from behind and earning a yellow card. Rogers spent a couple of minutes on the ground, grabbing at his shoulder, which he injured in the fall.
“I came down really hard on my arm, and it was thrown over my head,” said Rogers after spending the rest of the game on the bench with his arm in a sling. “So basically it’s dislocated, but from what I hear, it should be good in a few days.”
Rogers’ unavailability did not affect the Crimson’s ability to push forward. An excellent opportunity six minutes before halftime was just wide as McCarthy had only the Yale keeper to beat.
The final 40 seconds were troubling for the Bulldogs, as the keeper had to stretch to get a hold of a header spiraling towards the top of the goal but was able to secure it.
After the break, Harvard came onto the field seemingly with a more defensive attitude, as the attacking energy from the end of the first half was no longer present. Instead, Yale had scattered opportunities throughout the half that were thwarted by the Crimson defense, anchored by co-captain Robert Millock.
Millock did appear in trouble at one point though when Yale’s Eric Meyer forced his way past the senior, leaving him alone with junior goalkeeper Austin Harms. Meyer moved closer from the left and shot the ball to the opposite side, which was left open by Harms. Harms watched as the ball flew just wide of the right post, allowing Harvard fans to breathe again. It was the best chance of the game for the Bulldogs, a wasted opportunity that would have leveled the score and put the visiting side back in the game with 17 minutes remaining.
The Crimson was caught offsides twice in the final five minutes of the game as Harvard tried to reclaim some of the offensive dominance that it exhibited in the first half. Junior Jamie Rees and Prozeller were critical in the midfield, setting up plays with pinpoint passing. Rees had a shot that flew high above the crossbar, which marked the Crimson’s final attempt on goal as the team ran down the clock to end the game.
“From minute 1-60, we played with a lot of confidence both on the ball and defensively,” Junot said. “And then after the 60th minute we took more of a defensive shell-shape, where we still defended extremely well, but I would like to see us finish the game with the same confidence in terms of going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year Kyle Casey suffered a broken metatarsal while playing pickup basketball with his teammates Saturday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, Casey told The Crimson last night.
Casey will undergo surgery at Boston’s Baptist Hospital tomorrow and is expected to miss between six and eight weeks before returning to the court.
“I got the ball and made a hard cut going to the rim,” Casey said. “I felt a pop, and I fell.”
Casey had X-rays taken yesterday afternoon that revealed the break in his foot.
Casey will likely miss the opening portion of Harvard’s nonconference schedule but is expected to return in time for the start of Ivy League play.
“It could have been worse, so I’m just trying to stay optimistic, but it’s pretty bad news for myself and my team,” Casey said.
Heading into his sophomore season, Casey was predicted by several media outlets to contend for the Ivy League Player of the Year Award while helping the Crimson compete for its first conference title. As a freshman, Casey led the Crimson in rebounding and finished second in scoring, averaging 10.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.

If you were hoping to go to the Harvard Box Office to snag a free ticket to "The Social Network," don't count on it.
The free showing, which is part of the College Events Board's "Dinner and a Movie" night this Thursday, was so hotly anticipated that the Box Office ran out of tickets yesterday—the very same day the tickets were released.
"We couldn't even believe how quickly they ran out," said CEB vice-chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr. '11
In its fifth rendition, the "Dinner and a Movie" event combines discounts at many Harvard Square restaurants with a free showing of a movie at the AMC Loews Harvard Square Theater.
In the past, tickets were available up until the day of the showing. Last fall, the CEB released tickets for "Where the Wild Things Are" on Sunday, Oct. 18, but it wasn't until Thursday at 3 p.m. that the CEB was notified that the tickets had run out, James A. McFadden '10, a former vice-chair of the CEB and Crimson editorial editor, said at the time.
Still, the CEB wasn't counting on tickets sitting unclaimed at the box office this time. When asked, Anastos said he expected tickets for "The Social Network," a widely-acclaimed movie about former Harvard student Mark E. Zuckerburg and the founding of Facebook, to last until today. That they were gone so quickly, he said, was unexpected.
"We did not anticipate it running out this quickly," he said.

An incident in Quincy House this weekend gave a whole new meaning to the phrase “door droppings.”
 Quincy resident Charles W. Li '12 checked the dropbox outside his room Sunday evening and said he saw what he thought was a black T-shirt. Taking a closer look at the mysterious delivery, he said was hit by “an overwhelming stench” and the realization that the item in his dropbox was not a T-shirt—it was a soiled pair of men’s underwear.
 “It was chunky,” Li’s roommate Duncan J. Watts '12 said of the underwear’s contents, which Li disposed of with his hand safely sheltered within a plastic bag. 
Li said that he and his roommates had not looked in their dropbox since the previous day, and he said he presumed that the surprise was left by a Saturday night partygoer.
“I have two possibilities,” he said. “I assume it’s a drunk guy. Either he was in somebody’s room nearby, and he ran outside and put it in our dropbox. Or he just took off his underwear in the hallway.”
 He added that some friends have asked him whether he has any enemies who might have left a little brown gift in his dropbox. Li’s response: “Even if I did, I’m pretty sure they would have enough self-respect not to soil themselves in the hallway.”
 Li and Watts agreed that they’ll probably never learn who the crap culprit is, even though Li sent an e-mail over the Quincy House list asking, “How are you in college and not toilet-trained?” and advising the poopy perpetrator to “Please get some diapers.”
 “If a guy was trashed enough to do something like this, then I don’t think he’ll remember doing this,” Li said. He’s given up on finding the offender since, in his words, “I assume it will be a one-time occurrence.”
