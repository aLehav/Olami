After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fountain of youth is overrated. Sometimes it’s better to embrace the maturity, sophistication, and consistency that come with age. Justin Timberlake may not seem that old, but at a ripe 32 he’s 20 years removed from his debut on the Mickey Mouse Club and 13 years from N’Sync’s historic commercial smash “No Strings Attached.” The skin-tight t-shirts and hair gel are long gone, replaced by bow ties and a slickly combed hairstyle. On his latest effort, “The 20/20 Experience,” the music matches the look and attitude. The hooks may not be as catchy as we’re used to, but the album as a whole is a sprawling, ambitious effort that shows a pop star who has grown into a musician before our eyes.
Timberlake’s developed sophistication is made apparent within the first few seconds as a cascade of orchestral strings launches “Pusher Love Girl,” one of the most fully realized songs Timberlake has ever recorded. The song is a slow-jam ode to a girl that Timberlake compares to just about every drug imaginable—so much for teenage innocence. But his once-squeaky falsetto sounds better than ever, soaring over a wash of muted guitars, synths, horns, and voices in rich harmony. It’s Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, updated and modernized for a new generation.
You can give the credit partially to Timbaland, the once-omnipresent pop producer who hasn’t really been relevant since, well, Timberlake’s “FutureSex/LoveSounds” in 2006. The orchestration of “Pusher Love Girl” is one of the many things that Timbaland gets right on the album; he also brings his trademark slithering vibe to “Don’t Hold The Wall” and hurtles “Tunnel Vision” forward with a huge, clattering snare drums and a new-feeling synth sound every section. Throughout, the dense, varied production provides new discoveries upon every listen.
But while the production is certainly elegant, it’s not particularly innovative. The rhythmic vocal patterns and drum timbres that were futuristic 10 years ago now sound five years dated. Timbaland also has the annoying habit of inserting his “yeahs” and grunts at every possible opportunity. Especially given the recent boom in R&B innovation, with pioneers like Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, and James Blake constantly attacking the established sound, it’s slightly disappointing that neither Timberlake nor Timbaland reached too far outside their comfort zones.
This unwillingness to experiment is not much of a setback, however, when the results are as solid as “Spaceship Coupe” or “Mirrors.” Timberlake has never been a great lyricist, but he sounds quite convincing on “Spaceship Coupe” when he croons, “Everybody’s looking for the flyest thing to say / But I just want to fly away with you.” Timbaland bolsters Timberlake’s delicate melody with insistent piano chords on the top, a buzzing synth bass on the bottom, and indecipherable bloops and whirls in the middle. Even the best N’Sync love ballads seem like contrived child’s play compared to this one.
And then there’s “Mirrors,” the most obvious potential hit here. The musical addendum to “What Goes Around”—which itself was a musical addendum to “Cry Me a River”—“Mirrors” shows Timberlake at his hugest, with ringing stadium electric guitars blaring out over a standard three-chord pop progression. The song sounds generic upon first listen and affecting the next; by the third listen, the searing harmonies are embedded deep in the brain. It’s a little too long—the herky-jerky “You are / You are the love of my life” chant towards the end feels tacky—but there’s no doubt that JT will be singing the song in encores late into his career.
In fact, “Mirrors” encapsulates the album as a whole—smartly written, passionately sung, magnificently produced, but also slightly bloated and lacking in immediacy. Maybe this is just an inevitable tradeoff in adulthood and evidence that Timberlake has reached his peak. But considering how many pop stars we’ve seen fall off, it’s a pleasure to see him age gracefully, just like Sinatra, Jay, and the rest of America’s timeless pop icons before him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
“Bring me only beautiful useless things. / Only old home things touched at sunset in the quiet…” requests a wounded soldier in Carl Sandburg’s poem “Murmurings in a Field Hospital.” I read these lines a long time ago, but they jumped to the front of my mind as I listened to Low’s “The Invisible Way” for the first time.
 
There’s something beautiful and useless about “The Invisible Way.” It certainly has the highest production value of any album Low has put out in their 20-year career, but for the most part it simply retreads the same musical concepts as those other albums. Only when Low strays from its hypnotizing, down-tempo formula into stylistically ambitious territory does “The Invisible Way” become interesting.
 
Low, a trio built around the married co-lead vocalists Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk, has maintained a fairly consistent style since its formation in 1993. Now, more than 12 years after the release of their critical breakthrough “Things We Lost in the Fire,” Low are still checking all of the same boxes that drove “Fire” to success. Harmonized vocals held at length over slow, soft percussion? Check. Innocuous, atmospheric guitar picking? Check. Symbolic, haunting lyrics that evade immediate interpretation? Check. There’s nothing inherently wrong with a band sticking to a certain style, but as demonstrated by the few atypical tracks on “The Invisible Way,” Low could certainly expand their range while still retaining their unique identity. Album highlight “Just Make It Stop” does so with a driving rhythm section and forceful, purposed vocals delivered by Parker. The charming “Holy Ghost” eliminates the rhythm section, allowing Parker’s voice to weave around a folksy guitar backing.
 
The problem is, for every “Just Make It Stop” and “Holy Ghost,” there are multiple songs that are—and there’s really no other way to put this—boring, though lovely.  “Waiting” and “Mother,” among others, take initially interesting melodies and beat them into submission with agonizing repetition. Musical reiteration is a key element of Low’s minimalist style, but the band usually makes it work by building the recurring structures into something purposeful—the lead-up to a heart-wrenching climax, a tool for hammering in certain lyrical images, or both. Low seem to lose much of their drive on “The Invisible Way.” Many songs just drift away, and it’s frustratingly unclear why the band didn’t try to do more with them.
 
The most compelling reason to listen to “The Invisible Way” all the way through is how aesthetically outstanding its production sounds. Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who produced the album, provides Low’s sound with a newfound clarity. In the past, Parker’s drums have tended to dominate the band’s sonic space at the expense of vocals and guitar. Tweedy’s decision to fade the drums way down gives the guitar and piano more room to reverberate and prop up the extended vocal lines. Furthermore, the way certain instruments are isolated through right-to-left panning puts an end to the muddled sound that has plagued most of Low’s past albums.These techniques are especially evident on “Amethyst,” in which a barely noticeable snare drum whispers out of the right speaker in syncopation with deep, resonating piano chords echoing from the left. Tweedy’s production simultaneously gives “The Invisible Way” vibrancy and intimacy, which is a difficult balancing act.
 
Because Low’s songs move so slowly, their lyrics tend to linger in the listener’s mind. In the past this has been a good thing, but the lyrical quality feels significantly more scattershot on “The Invisible Way.” Nothing on “The Invisible Way” comes remotely close to reaching the emotional potency of “In Metal,” an ode to Parker and Sparhawk’s newborn child on “Things We Lost in the Fire.” “The Invisible Way” features a few great lines, especially in “Holy Ghost”: “Feeds my passion for transcendence / Turns my water into wine / Makes me wish I was empty.” However, the album also features a lot of throwaway, juvenile writing: “And into the air / We take a chance / Can no longer bear / To miss the dance,” sings Parker on “So Blue.” Unfortunately, the second case is much more common than the first on “The Invisible Way,” which makes the repetitive musical structures that much more grating.
 
Is “The Invisible Way” beautiful? Definitely. Is it useless? It’s tough to tell. The album doesn’t contribute much depth to Low’s musical oeuvre. It’s also tough to think of many settings in which “The Invisible Way” would be appropriate—while the music is not compelling enough for a focused listen, putting Low on in the background is kind of like switching on a black hole, sucking the energy out of whatever you’re doing. There are parts of the album, most notably the production, that shine, but the rest of it simply feels—as the title suggests—invisible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Devin Dwyer set up camp behind the Duke net. As the clock ticked toward zero, somebody had to be open—a pushing penalty had put the Harvard men’s lacrosse team on the man up with eight seconds left in regulation. The Crimson freshman saw an opening at the top of the crease and launched a pass above the crossbar.
But the ball would never reach its intended destination. The rubber found the large pocket of Blue Devils goaltender Kyle Turri, who cleared the ball down the field as time expired.
“I think looking back, we would run the same thing,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “I think what we wanted was there.”
The Crimson (4-5, 1-1 Ivy) entered Saturday night’s contest looking to upset the No. 10/12 team in the nation for the first time in four seasons. With a controlled attack and a few key stops, Harvard came oh-so-close to its first signature win of the season in front of 4,110 fans at Harvard stadium.
“I think that for a majority of the game we did fight and we did do what we wanted to do,” captain Jason Gonos said. “We just got to put that complete game together to be where we want to be.”
The Crimson managed to control the pace early against the seventh-ranked NCAA Division I offense. Although Duke capitalized on rebounds in the second half, Ivy League Player of the Week Harry Krieger was a solid presence between the pipes for Harvard with nine saves. Late in the second quarter, the senior stifled a Blue Devil odd-man rush with a left leg-save on his weak side.
Defender Joe Petrucci faced the daunting task of covering Duke’s leading attackman Jordan Wolf, who finished the night with three goals. But the Crimson junior nevertheless backstopped Harvard effectively, consistently beating Wolf to the touchline and forcing turnovers.
“Joe Petrucci is an amazing athlete,” said Gonos, a fellow defenseman. “He definitely showed his athleticism and his pride and his heart today by running those balls down.”
CLOSING IT OUT
In a game that saw four lead changes and 10 unique ties, neither team held more than a one-goal lead until the fourth quarter. As the Crimson and the Blue Devils struggled to string together any sort of run, Harvard appeared to gain a solid upper hand with the game’s first two-goal lead of the game at the 7:22 mark of the final frame.
Yet in the next minute and a half, Duke would vaporize the Crimson advantage. Blue Devils attackman and leading scorer Jordan Wolf opened up a 4-0 run with 6:25 left on the clock. Sophomore midfielder Will Haus won the very next faceoff for Duke before sprinting through a gap in the Harvard defense for an unassisted and uncontested score 12 seconds later.
“They made a really great play,” Gonos said of Haus’s goal. “We were a little slow to go to the guy running down the field. In retrospect, maybe we could have met him a little bit sooner and got our hands on him so he couldn’t get as good of a shot as he did.”
The Blue Devils rode the one-two punch for two more strikes before holding on for the win. In many ways, the run was reminiscent of Brown’s four unanswered fourth-quarter goals in its 11-9 come-from-behind win over the Crimson two weeks earlier.
“Our thoughts are, ‘Hey, we were a play away from winning this game, and we’d be happy,’” Wojcik said. “We’re going to come back together on Monday, talk about what we did well, which was a lot, and then talk about and work on how we can close out that game better and make progress from there.”
VANDERVELDE
After recording his first career hat trick in his team’s 16-7 loss to Albany on Tuesday, Murphy Vandervelde approached Saturday night’s matchup with an edge.
“Looking forward, we’ve got Duke on Saturday, and we’re going to really stick it to them,” Vandervelde said Tuesday. “This was a wakeup call.”
On Saturday, the sophomore midfielder backed up those words with yet another three-goal performance.
Vandervelde struck thrice on the man-up with machine-like efficiency. Each power-play goal followed a similar pattern: Harvard cycled the ball around the Duke defense before kicking it out to the wing for Vandervelde, who delivered three accurate rips from long range.
The sophomore’s first goal came with 2:25 left in the third quarter to tie things at seven.
His second and third goals provided the Crimson’s last two leads of the game early in the fourth. Harvard finished the night 3-for-4 on the man-up.
“He’s got a very good form, and he’s got a very heavy shot,” Wojcik said of Vandervelde. “We did a really good job setting his shot up on the extra man. Pete Schwartz and Devin Dwyer did a really good job getting the ball.”
Before the Crimson’s 9-6 win at Dartmouth on March 23, Vandervelde had zero career collegiate goals to his name. Three games later, the sophomore midfielder has seven. As Harvard prepares to host No. 3 Cornell next Saturday, Wojcik will have a new offensive weapon at his disposal.
“I was really happy to see how well and confident Murphy was shooting the ball,” Wojcik said. “When he gets his hands free, he can really bring it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After three consecutive losses in California over spring break, the Harvard men’s volleyball team could use some home cooking. Cambridge delivered, as the Crimson (13-7, 6-3 EIVA) won in straight games over Erskine (13-14, 9-6 Carolinas) 25-20, 25-23, 25-19, Saturday afternoon at the Malkin Athletic Center. The win marks the eleventh consecutive home victory for Harvard.
“We lost three in California and we were looking at this match as a way to train for the final playoff run over the next three weeks,” coach Brian Baise said. “So for us it [this game] is an indicator of what we’re doing well and what we need to improve on.”
Sophomore DJ White paced the team with 10 kills on .278 hitting while junior co-captain Nick Madden added eight kills of his own in addition to a game-high six blocks.
The Crimson should certainly be proud of yet another comfortable win at home but the quality of the opposition was less than that which Harvard will face in the upcoming weeks of conference play.
“I thought we did some things really well,” Baise said. “Our serving was for the most part better than it was last week in California and I thought offensively we were pretty strong. Our blocking needs to improve, though our defense in general needs to improve—we gave away a few too many points.”
After a comfortable first set during which the Flying Fleet was unable to find any rhythm the, second set was a much tenser affair.
Tied at 23-23, the game could have gone either way, but the Crimson was saved by two poor handling errors by the opposition.
“I think we were a little bit steadier on offense, we didn’t make quite as many errors,” Baise said. “Other than the second game, our hitters did a real good job of not making unforced errors. Rob Lothman, our center, put the ball where it needed to be. I think that was the key difference, they missed eighteen serves and we missed ten so that helps too.”
In a bizarre turn, especially given Harvard’s fine home form, there was a substantial Erskine presence at the match. The private school from South Carolina is currently competing in its first year as a varsity volleyball program and is comprised of an undergraduate population of only 575. Nevertheless the Flying Fleet’s fanbase—decked out in “Go Erskine, Beat Harvard”—easily eclipsed that of the Crimson.
“[The large Erskine support] was really cool,” freshman hitter Branden Clemens said. “This was their first year and it’s pretty exciting that they can get that many fans out.… I do wish more Harvard people would come, though.”
The fierce Erskine crowd support rallied during the third set behind a Flying Fleet comeback after Harvard jumped out to an 8-4 lead. Suddenly, for the first time in the match, the momentum was all with the men from South Carolina.
But in the end, it was all to no avail, as the Crimson went on a 13-5 run, to put the game to bed.
“We’ve done that a number of times this year,” Baise said. “Where it was tight about halfway through that third game, and we were able to get a little momentum and we were able to stay real focused to make some plays on defense. We made it hard for them to score and any time you put pressure on another team it works to your advantage.”
Despite the win, Harvard will still be disappointed with certain aspects of its game. Serving has been a particular area of weakness for the team of late.
“We’ve struggled with [our serving] a bit,” Baise said. “In California we had a real rough stretch with our serving and we worked a lot at it this week and it was better today than it had been.”
The team made 10 errors and recorded only six aces, improving from 12 and zero, respectively, in its last game against Concordia. This easily outgunned the Fleet, who made a whopping 18 errors with only seven aces, but still falls short of the kind of serving performance that the team will be hoping for as it enters the business end of the season.
“[The] next five games are important for us; next weekend in particular,” Baise said. “[Our serving] will need to be a little better to win those games."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping its first two games of the Ivy League season against Penn on Friday, Harvard softball bounced back to sweep Columbia on Saturday. The Crimson (9-14, 2-2 Ivy) relied on strong pitching to top the Lions (11-13, 1-3).
Overall, the weekend’s games proved to be an up-and-down start to Harvard’s Ancient Eight campaign. After beating the Quakers in last year’s Ivy League championship series, opening the season with consecutive losses stung more than usual.
“We have mixed feelings about the weekend,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We were disappointed on Friday, but we bounced back on Saturday.”
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 1
Game two of the series got off to a rough start for the Crimson. A pair of errors allowed Columbia to score an unearned run in the home frame of the first.
But Harvard responded immediately with a two-run second inning. Sophomore Emily Gusse hit an RBI double and then scored on a wild pitch.
From there, it was smooth sailing for the Crimson. The team surrendered no more runs, even though Columbia had seven hits on the afternoon. Gusse gave the Crimson more insurance with another RBI in the sixth inning.
Sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz earned the win on the mound. Ruiz combined with freshman Jamie Hulula to hold the Lions to the lone unearned run.
“Our pitchers were hitting their spots more and moving the ball around,” Allard said. “When they threatened, we stayed stronger, and we didn’t get on our heels.”
The Crimson pitchers improved significantly after struggling against Penn, giving up 13 runs over the course of two games.  Ruiz proved to be the key player for Harvard. After giving up four earned runs in a third of an inning on Friday, she gave up no earned runs over five innings of work.
At the plate, the Crimson’s biggest bats in junior third baseman Kasey Lange and sophomore second baseman Katherine Lantz went cold, combining for just one hit. But Gusse took over, ripping two hits and accounting for all of the Crimson’s runs.
HARVARD 4, COLUMBIA 1
In the first game of the double-header Harvard got runners on base in the first two innings, but it was the Lions who were able to strike first, as Kayla Shimoda stroked a one-out solo home run to left center in the bottom of the second. Harvard stopped the damage there though, only allowing three more hits.
After two scoreless innings, Lange smashed a two-run home run to take the lead in the top of the fifth. With two more runs in the seventh Harvard came away with a 4-1 win.
Freshman Morgan Groom pitched a one-run complete game, controlling the play after giving up Shimoda’s slam. Groom struck out five on the day, her fifth complete game of the season, and a marked improvement over the six runs—two earned—she surrendered on Friday.
“It was good for them to see that after [Friday] they could come back,” junior captain Shelbi Olson said of the pitchers. “They gained a lot of confidence, and I think they’ll keep that going in the Ivy League season. They are taking it one day at a time and one pitch at a time, and yesterday was a lesson learned.”
The Crimson fell behind early in both games, as it has in many games this season, but battled back for the win.
“When the other team scores first, we know we have to score to win anyways,” Olson said. “We just focus on us. Early in the game we know there’s plenty of game left, and we just take it in stride.”
Nevertheless, the Crimson is excited to play in front of a supportive crowd this coming week. Princeton comes to town on Friday, giving Harvard its first home league game of the year. With an Ivy League championship still feasible for the team, Saturday’s game certainly showed that two losses would not derail its season.
“It’s hard for a team to go 4-0 on the road,” Allard said. “It was a hard trip, but we’re a battle-tested team, and we’re looking forward to more comfort at home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team faced stiff competition in the 86th Clyde Littlefield Texas Relays that took place this week at the University of Texas at Austin from Wednesday to Saturday, and the Snowflake Classic hosted by Tufts in Medford, Mass. on Saturday.
The divided Crimson squad faced different levels of competition at events and had varying degrees of success.
86th CLYDE LITTLEFIELD TEXAS RELAYS
The Texas Relays featured athletes from a number of schools from around the country, including nearly all of the top track and field programs. Eight of the top 10 men’s teams in the USTFCCCA preseason rankings were represented at the meet.
Against these talents, it was difficult for the Crimson to make its mark on the meet, but Harvard did have several standout performances in front of the more than 30,000 people who showed up to watch throughout the weekend.
“The Texas Relays is probably one of the most prestigious and competitive meets in the country,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s a great opportunity for our student-athletes to showcase their talents against some of the nation’s best. I was really pleased that we had the opportunity to send a contingent out there and they represented us very well.”
The Crimson was led by historic performances from freshman Autumne Franklin. Franklin’s times of 13.81 seconds in the women’s 100-meter hurdles preliminary round, and 59.55 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles preliminary round were both personal records, and the 400-meter time put her into the finals, where she finished seventh.
“[Both times] are number two all-time in school history, behind NCAA champ and Olympian Brenda Taylor,” Saretsky said. “For a freshman, she’s competing at an incredibly high level…and there’s a lot more still to come.”
Junior thrower Dustin Brode also had a strong performance for the Crimson, winning the men’s shot put section B event with a throw that traveled 17.23 meters, while senior Mary Hirst earned fourth place in the women’s high jump section B with a 1.70 meter jump.
TUFTS SNOWFLAKE CLASSIC
Facing a somewhat different level of competition at the Tufts Snowflake Classic, the Crimson turned in strong performances, winning several events and taking fifth place overall in the women’s events and fourth overall in the men’s. The teams’ opponents included local rivals such as Tufts, Northeastern, Boston College, and MIT, as well as Ivy League foe Brown, which finished eighth and fifth for men and women, respectively.
“Overall, I was extremely pleased by the meet,” Saretsky said. “There were some real highlights and positives for us to take as we enter the outdoor season.”
The Harvard women’s team was led by junior Olivia Abbate, who won the 100-meter hurdles with a time of 14.74, over half a second faster than her teammate, sophomore Hannah Nunez, who finished in second place.
Abbate and Nunez also competed in the women’s 4x400-meter relay, where they partnered up with freshmen teammates Ali Monfre and Julia Kee. The quartet finished in first with a time of 4:02, nine seconds better than the closest competitor.
“[Abbate] has shown some great signs of her potential this year,” Saretsky said. “It was great to see her put forward a performance like that.”
Junior Emily Reese also finished first in her event, the women’s 1500-meter run. With a time of 4:32 Reese defeated the rest of the field by just under three seconds.
The men of Harvard also performed well, led by strong performances from sophomore Connor Reck. Reck finished first in the men’s 800-meter run, just ahead of junior Erik Kraus and sophomore Billy Looney, who took second and third, respectively.
“It was pretty fun to win with my teammates,” Reck said. “But it was not unexpected. This wasn’t a huge meet. It was our first meet to get the outdoor season rolling and get some good times going into a big invitational next week.”
Reck went on to anchor for the Crimson in the 4x400-meter relay, which Harvard won. Competing with Reck in the relay were senior Zach Herring, and sophomores Jesaiah Coy and Owen Laub.
“I got the baton just behind the leader,” Reck said. “From there, I just sat on him until the last 150 [meters] and made my move around the outside to finish strong with the win.”
“Connor had a breakout performance today,” Saretsky said. “After a bit of a disappointing indoor season, we are really excited about what’s yet to come for him this outdoor season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s lightweight crew kicked off its spring season with a decisive victory over Delaware on Saturday morning.  The Crimson took three out of five races to secure the regatta win at home on the Charles River.
“I think it was one of the best first races of the season we’ve had, at least in my time at Harvard,” said senior Austin Meyer, fourth seat of the first varsity boat. “This is, I think, the best group of guys I have ever been a part of, and that showed through yesterday.”
The Harvard lightweights are coming off of a dominant 2012 season.  The Crimson posted an undefeated dual season record and captured both the Eastern title at EARC Sprints and the 2012 IRA National Championship.
The team historically begins its spring season each year by racing the Blue Hens.
“It’s always great to start our season against Delaware,” said senior Erich Shultze, fifth seat of the second varsity boat. “It’s a really good way for us to get into the spring racing and we are really glad they come up every year to race us.”
The Harvard first varsity eight finished in 6:08.4, recording a 16.5-second margin over Delaware.
“Our race was a really well put together row,” Meyer said. “We haven’t been in lineups for too long but the training that we’ve done in small boats has put together a very strong squad from top to bottom. We are all meshing together well at a very early stage, which is promising for the rest of the year.”
Under a minute into the first varsity race, the Crimson had taken the lead over the Blue Hens. Harvard was able to consistently move away from its opponents throughout the length of the course.
“We had a pretty good margin over Delaware, so that was positive,” said senior Matt O’Leary, second seat of the first varsity boat. “We were pleased with how well we started and how well we maintained our speed throughout the race.”
The Harvard second varsity boat posted the biggest margin of the regatta over the Blue Hens.  The Crimson finished in 6:23.8, defeating Delaware by 21.1 seconds.  The Harvard “A” boat won the third varsity race in 7:23.2, while the Blue Hens took the first and second freshmen races in two close finishes.
“We were fortunate enough to get wins in all three varsity events, and our freshmen race was tough too,” Schultze said. “But, on that note, we also need to know that it’s the first race of the season…. The teams that win later in the year as the races get bigger and become bigger challenges are the teams that make the most progress from week to week.”
The Crimson lightweights are gearing up for their Ivy League opener on April 7 against the University of Pennsylvania and Cornell.  Last year, Harvard dominated three of five races to secure the regatta win.
“There is a lot of depth in both of those programs so we definitely need to stick to our preparation this week, do what we know and get prepared to race,” Schultze said. “We have to get better from practice to practice.  It’s early enough in the season that there is still a lot of progress to be made every single day.”
Despite this weekend’s strong showing, the Harvard rowers still stress the need for continual improvement to match the program’s success last season.
“We have to make sure the whole team is improving every week,” O’Leary said. “It can’t just be one boat or one guy; it has to be all boats across the board.”
Meyer, a veteran rower, expressed confidence in the crew’s ability to achieve its goals for the season and repeat, if not surpass, its 2012 performance.
“I definitely think that this crew has the focus and the potential to be the best crew in Harvard lightweight history,” Meyer said.

Heading into this weekend, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) already had a hallmark season. The team capped an undefeated dual-meet season with a runner-up finish at the Ivy League Championships. But there was one meet left on tap, as the Crimson hoped to make a splash on the national stage at the NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championship.
But Harvard’s performance at the season-ending meet did not quite live up to its regular-season promise. The Crimson turned in eight top-30 performances but failed to reach the finals in any event.
“We had some pretty good swims, all things considered,” sophomore Chuck Katis said. “But I think overall we left wanting a little bit more out of the meet. We have some things to work on. Part of that is having the emotional roller coaster, coming from Ivy’s and HYP the week before. Sometimes it is a little tough to do three meets in a row.”
Katis entered the meet coming off a record-breaking regular season.  The sophomore recorded NCAA ‘A’ cuts as early as November, set school records in the 100 and 200 breaststroke, and took home his first individual Ivy League Championship in the 100-meter event two weeks ago.
The sophomore entered the national championships hoping to improve on last year’s success, where he finished just outside the finals in his two individual events but took home a pair of All-American honors as a part of the 400 and 800 free relay teams.
“Each year we come back, we want to get a little more out of the meet,” Katis said. “Last year, it was like icing on the cake just to make the meet and be able to compete there. This year, we wanted more.”
Katis was slated to compete in both the 100 and 200 breast events while also competing on three relay teams. But the sophomore came down with Scarlet Fever the week of the event and was forced to withdraw from all but one event. His lone swim was the 100 breast, in which he mustered a 24th place finish with a time of 53.82, less than half a second away from making the ‘B’ final and bringing home All-American honors.
Juniors Oliver Lee and Chris Satterthwaite both came close to reaching the finals in the 50 free. Lee placed 19th with a time of 19.98, while his classmate finished right behind him in 20th with a time of 20.08.
Michael Mosca, the first Harvard diver since 1994 to compete at the national championships, put up a 32nd place finish on the one-meter board. He followed it up with a 28th place showing on the three-meter.
Harvard turned in top-25 finishes in all three of its relay events. Lee, Satterthwaite, sophomore Griffin Schumacher, and junior Danny Crigler teamed for a time of 1:18.82 to finish in 19th in the 200 free relay, just barely missing out on the finals.
Satterthwaite, Schumacher, and Crigler were joined by sophomore Zach Walters in the 800 free relay and posted a time of 6:28.35, good for a 22nd-place showing. The Crimson had an identical finish in the 400 free relay, where Satterthwaite, Lee, Schumacher, and Walters combined for a time of 2:55.04.
“I don’t think this weekend reflected the amount of progress we made and the amount of work we put in,” Katis said. “Just based on time, we could’ve placed higher, could’ve been top-20, but that’s still on our goal list right now. I don’t think [NCAA’s] really displayed how good our team is. That just gives us motivation going forward. Rather than just making the meet, we want to be back in finals racing at night with all the top teams again.”
Five of the swimmers saw action in last year’s NCAA championships, with Crigler the lone Crimson swimmer making his national championship debut. Though the team failed to swim in the finals, the group used the opportunity to get a glimpse at the nation’s top swimming programs.
“[On Saturday night], we watched three guys break three different NCAA records,” Crigler said. “It was the fastest meet I’ve ever been to. To be a part of it with five other Harvard teammates was really special.”
Though Harvard’s performance left something to be desired, the team’s performance will no doubt serve as motivation by the time next season rolls around.
“I think we need to take the work we did this year and, moving forward into next year, get a couple of guys on board and bring a group of maybe ten or twelve guys to NCAA’s instead of just six,” Crigler said. “We have the chance to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard baseball team suffered a loss in its first game of the day, the elements ensured that the winner of the second matchup would not be revealed just yet.
Playing against Penn in a doubleheader on Sunday, the Crimson offense couldn’t get started in a 4-1 loss in the first contest. With the score tied at three in the second game of the double header, the umpires were forced to suspend play when the rain picked up in the eighth inning. The game will be resumed Monday at noon.
“Tomorrow, we’re in a huge position because we only have two innings of baseball to play,” sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel said. “So I think what we need to do is come out extremely focused and fired up and ready to give 100 percent right away. We can’t waste any time with anything…. If we can manage to score in the two innings tomorrow, we should come out pretty successful.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 3 – SUSPENDED IN THE TOP OF THE EIGHTH
In its second game of the day, the Crimson and the Quakers each posted three-run innings before rain delayed the game after seven frames.
Harvard got off to a fast start in the top of the first inning when a single and two walks loaded the bases with no outs. Another single from sophomore clean-up batter Nick Saathoff brought in the first run of the game.
In the very next at-bat, sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson drove in two more runs with a base hit up the middle.
But those three tallies were all the scoring the Harvard offense would manage. After allowing a sacrifice bunt, Penn starter Pat Bet settled down and forced a foul out and a strikeout to end the threat.
Another squandered scoring opportunity came in the fourth. Although the Crimson loaded the bases with one out, Bet forced sophomore infielder Mike Martin to ground into a double play up the middle.
Freshman pitcher Sean Poppen (1-1), coming off a three-hit complete game in his last outing, went seven innings for Harvard and allowed three runs. Although Poppen surrendered ten hits, he managed, for the most part, to spread them out and keep himself out of trouble.
The exception came in the bottom of the fifth. Freshman Gary Tesch led off with a triple down the right field line for the Quakers, and the very next batter singled him home.
After another single and a sacrifice bunt, senior Spencer Branigan tied the game with a double to left that drove in two more, the last of the runs to be had for either side on Sunday.
PENN 4, HARVARD 1
Harvard outhit Penn in the first game of the weekend, but the Crimson failed to produce scores and fell, 4-1.
The Crimson did not score until its last inning at the plate in the top of the seventh, when the first two batters reached base and a single from junior outfielder Jeff Hajdin cut the deficit to three.
But the Quakers made a pitching change and the next three Harvard batters failed to reach base, with two going down on strikes.
“They played well,” Anderson said. “They went ahead early, and we did a pretty decent job later in the game coming back. We had a bunch of momentum in the last inning; unfortunately it didn’t go our way.”
Sophomore pitcher Dan Gautieri picked up his fourth win of the year, holding the Crimson to one run—zero earned—in his six complete innings.
Anderson (0-3), who allowed four runs in five innings, took the loss for Harvard.
Penn put up a tally in the first when leadoff hitter Connor Betbeze walked and made his way to third on a steal and a wild pitch before a single scored him.
The score remained 1-0 until a three-run fifth inning put Penn firmly in the lead. A two-RBI single from Betbeze began the scoring, and he was brought home on the very next at-bat by another single from freshman Mike Vilardo that pushed the score to 4-0.
Harvard had a number of chances to put some runs on the board throughout the game. The Crimson loaded the bases with one out in the top of the first but came away with nothing.
The team stranded runners on second and third in the sixth, one inning before the last-effort rally in the seventh fell short.
“We just got behind, and we couldn’t really knock anybody in,” Kregel said. “We didn’t execute when runners were in scoring position. We just can’t get runners in that are already in scoring position, and that’s a reoccurring issue at this point.”
UPDATE: After resuming play Monday at noon, the Crimson (4-18, 1-3 Ivy) scored three in the top of the ninth, to win 6-3. After a scoreless eighth, Kregel singled to load the bases and the next batter, sophomore Nick Saathof, was walked, bringing home the game-winning run. Tanner Anderson was hit by a pitch, bringing home another insurance run and Bailey forced a fielder's choice to give Harvard a three-run lead. Penn managed one hit in the bottom of the ninth, but was kept scoreless, giving the visiting Crimson the first win of the Ivy League season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first Ivy League contests of the season, the Harvard baseball team did not get off to a big start in the Big Apple.
The Crimson (3-18, 0-3 Ivy) dropped a pair of games on Saturday against Columbia (9-12, 2-0), the first by a score of 5-0 and the second, 3-2, on a walkoff single in the bottom of the ninth.
“The first game we didn’t play up to our potential, but I definitely think the second game we were in it all game,” freshman catcher DJ Link said. “We were down at one point, but we fought back very well…. We still have work to do and we’re going to keep working hard.”
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 2
The second game of the double header went down to the wire. Tied at two after six innings, both teams battled it out, scoreless, for the next two frames.
That changed in the bottom of the ninth. With two outs and men on second and third, Columbia sophomore Gus Craig entered as a pinch hitter. In his first at-bat of the day, Craig reached out and blooped a ball down the left field line to bring home the winning run.
“Ballgames aren’t won in the ninth inning; there were a lot of things we could have done early on,” senior pitcher Matt Doyle said. “The bloop single over the third baseman, no one could have caught it. He just threw his hands out there and got it.”
Doyle started game two for the Crimson and went seven innings, surrendering two runs off five hits. The senior utilized his diverse pitching arsenal, sporting a changeup and curveball in addition to his fastball, to keep the Lions hitters off balance.
Columbia pushed across a run in the third and fourth innings on two RBI singles to seize a 2-0 lead.
But Harvard bounced right back in the top of the fifth, scoring a run off a single from sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson.
The next inning, the Crimson mounted a two-out rally, and a single from sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel plated sophomore infielder Mike Martin, who had just doubled.
But Harvard failed to push across any more runs in the inning, eventually stranding runners on second and third.
Anderson led the way offensively for the Crimson, posting three of the team’s eight hits and driving in a run.
“That was one of the first ballgames that we’ve been in in the ninth inning the last two weeks, other than the wins at Houston Baptist,” Doyle said. “It was good to get a taste of playing in a complete game. We left a few runners on, and made one or two bad pitches and they capitalized on it. We still have room to grow together.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 0
In a game with little offense, the Lions took advantage of timely hitting to coast to a 5-0 victory in both squads’ first Ivy League test of the year.
Harvard scattered four hits throughout the game, only one less than the total amassed by Columbia. But the difference was that the Lions brought their runners home when they got them on base.
Columbia sophomore Joey Falcone was largely responsible for such production, going two-for-three on the night with two runs and a two-run homer in the fifth that gave the Lions a commanding lead.
The home run followed a long fourth inning in which Columbia put three on the board. After loading the bases with no outs, two runs scored on a fielder’s choice coupled with a Harvard throwing error. A sacrifice fly a few batters later brought home one more run.
The Crimson had trouble against Lions starter David Speer, who went the distance in the seven-inning shutout. The lefty did not allow more than one hit in an inning, walked none, and struck out six.
“The first kid from Columbia, he had our number as a team,” Link said. “He had a lot of movement on his fastball; he was a lefty throwing his cut fastball. He had a lot of our guys rolling over his cut fastball because it had late movement on it. He threw us pretty well.”
Junior Sam Dodge pitched all six innings for Harvard and allowed three earned runs in what was the first Ancient Eight game for the ten freshmen on the roster.
“The Ivy League is where the games really start to matter, so it was a good experience,” Link said. “We got a good indication of what Ivy League baseball is like, and I feel like the whole preseason and spring break and all that prepared us pretty well for Ivy League play. We just have to keep playing baseball fundamentally.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to get more on the court, the Harvard women’s tennis team (8-4) has given up a few things off of it.
“We have a little tradition where we have team Lent,” freshman Hai-Li Kong said. “Someone might give up grease, someone might give up YouTube. It’s a collaborative effort to help us focus.”
Kong and her teammates have had a lot of success since making the pledge, defeating Syracuse (9-7), 6-1, on Saturday, for their seventh win in eight matches. Since losing contests to Boston College, Kansas State, and William and Mary, the team has only fallen once in March. The Crimson has won five straight at home and heads into conference play healthy for the first time all season.
“We definitely played amazing [this weekend],” Kong said. “This was one of our best matches this year. We had so much energy against Syracuse, a very energetic team of really tough fighters. It was great to have a team that can really push us with our energy.”
In another effort to keep the team focused, the players have listed individual and team goals on posters that it looks at every day before and after practice. The posters hang in the players’ lockers and serve as a reminder of what the team has been working for. Coach Traci Green credited this game-by-game focus and recent health as reasons for the recent success.
“The team has been taking it one match at a time,” Green said. “They’ve been getting healthier as a team and it’s the first time in a long time we have had the whole squad healthy and ready to go.”
The match was the final nonconference tilt of the season for the team, which boasts a 50-21 record in dual matches this season. The team has been dominant in recent weeks, blanking NJIT and Binghampton back-to-back for the first consecutive shutouts the team has had since 2010.
Saturday’s defeat of Syracuse reversed the outcome from a year ago, where the Orange won 4-3. The Crimson took five of the six singles matches Saturday after winning two of the three doubles contests to take the additional doubles points. In line three doubles, Kong and junior Hannah Morrill outfought their Orange opponents to record an 8-5 victory. In the line one matchup, co-captains Hideko Tachibana and Kristin Norton ran their doubles record to 6-0 on the year with an 8-3 victory over Maddie Kobelt and Brittany Lashway.
“Hideko and Kristin are really the heart and soul of our team,” Green said. “They are our two seniors and captains and we go where they go. Right now they are fired up and they have been having solid practices and as a team we are looking to build off the win and continue that momentum against Columbia.”
In singles, Tachibana struggled through a straight-set loss to her line one opponent. But  the Crimson won 10 of the remaining 12 sets that were contested. Freshman Amanda Lin bounced back after losing the first set, 4-6, to take the next two sets, 6-2, 6-4.
Sophomore Sylvia Li similarly rebounded from an early deficit, losing the first set 3-6 and then denying her opponent the victory by winning two straight games at 5-all in the second set and taking the third set tiebreaker, 10-4.
Norton never struggled in her line three match, getting on her opponent from the beginning of the match in a 6-0, 6-0, victory. In lines two and four, freshmen He and Kong, respectively, took care of their opponents in straight sets to seal the victory for the Crimson.
Kong said that there has been a long adjustment period to the college game for the four freshmen on the team—Kong, Lin, He, and Crystal Yen.
The four have taken on large roles on the team in their first year, however. He played line two on the team on Saturday, even with Norton being healthy. Lin and He lead the team with eight wins each, while Kong has played most of the year in the top six. Yen stepped in for the team at line six as it struggled with a slew of injuries earlier in the semester.
“I think just having first semester under our belts really helped bring us together [as freshmen] second semester,” Kong said. “Traveling together over spring break has really helped us bond. I think since we came back from break we have all played really well and this boosted our confidence.”

It's finally spring: The snow is disappearing, the Charles is no longer frozen, and you can actually wear shorts outside without fear of frostbite. Celebrate the 50—and dare we say 60—degree weather with a jog outdoors, unencumbered by layers of cold gear and fleece. To get started, here are some running routes, all of which begin at the Curious George Store in Harvard Square:
Porter Square, 2 miles: Run up Mass. Ave. away from the river, make a stop at Shaw's, run back.
Eliot Bridge, 2.4 miles: Run down JFK St., turn right at the river, run along Memorial Drive, cross Eliot Bridge, run back and cross the JFK Bridge.
Inman Square loop, 3.4 miles: Jog to Annenberg, continue on Cambridge St., turn right on Webster Ave., turn right on Mass. Ave., run back to the Square. Resist the urge to stop at Toscanini's.
B.U. Bridge, 4.4 miles: Start down JFK St., cross the JFK Bridge, turn left and run along Memorial Drive, cross Storrow Dr., cross the B.U. Bridge, turn left and run back to the Square along Memorial Drive.
Fresh Pond, 5.6 miles: Run up Mass. Ave., turn left onto Garden St., continue onto Concord Ave., run a lap around Fresh Pond, run back.

In this series, Flyby Staff Writer Olivia M. Munk identifies, dissects, and discusses ideas, articles, and opinions found in popular media and popular culture. She's here to inform you and to make you think—about what's out there, what it means to us, and what it might mean for you.
WHAT IT IS
 
A letter to the editor posted on The Daily Princetonian's website outlines one female alum's main advice for matriculating women: Find a husband. Susan A. Patton, President of Princeton’s Class of 1977, writes , "Here's what nobody is telling you: Find a husband on campus before you graduate. Yes, I went there."
 
Patton argues that had she given birth to a daughter, she would advise her to seek out a husband that is of equal intelligence, and that college is the number one place to find him. This, however, should not take the full four years. Patton notes that "freshman women... have four classes of men to choose from. Every year, you lose the men in the senior class, and you become older than the class of incoming freshman men. So, by the time you are a senior, you basically have only the men in your own class to choose from, and frankly, they now have four classes of women to choose from. Maybe you should have been a little nicer to these guys when you were freshmen?"

 
WHY IT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
 
Patton's letter, aside from offering advice one would expect to hear on a reality show along the lines of "The Millionaire Matchmaker," calls into question to what extent the notion of women's "place" in higher education has changed over the years. Traditionally, women have been expected to marry and have a baby; today, education and career equality have supposedly all but broken this standard. Still, it seems a kind of "cult of domesticity" thinking persists.
 
When my mother was a senior in high school, she told her guidance counselor that she was seeking a college program where she could pursue a degree in biochemistry. Even though it was the '60s, an era known for its Feminine Mystiques and bra-burning, my mother was calmly told that girls didn't do chemistry, so why didn't she just look into becoming a nutritionist?
 
Decades later, my mother is now a professor of biochemistry, and today's universities seek to integrate more women into their Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) programs. A report from last year shows that since the 1980s, women have steadily outnumbered men in terms of college enrollment. Still, in the workplace itself, a gender wage gap persists: In 2012, women earned only 77 cents per dollar that men earned for the same work.
As a college-enrolled female myself, these two facts are somewhat disheartening. Even though my mother is now a successful scientist, is it possible that over her lifetime, she is earning less for the same work than her male counterparts do? Even though the women in my class will earn the same degrees, take the same classes, and do the same jobs as the men in our concentrations's graduating class, will we have to work harder just to make equal pay?
SO WHAT?
As the dating website boom demonstrates, meeting potential mates in the "real world" once one is past a certain age does become more difficult. College is a surreal time of life where you live and work with several thousand people of the same age who are, as admissions officers will assure you, of equal or—if you're lucky—even greater intelligence. So, yes, logistically, it would be very convenient to find one's soulmate in college, before career and financial worries take precedence over dating.
 
However, Patton's argument is troubling to many young women of college age in that it is woefully devoid of so much of the feminist sentiment that seems, to our generation, like it should be status quo. If college women are preoccupied with snagging a husband, as Patton deems appropriate, then maybe they won't place as much importance on their schoolwork; but after all, why get an A in organic chemistry and become a doctor if you're going to settle down with children and an investment-banking hubby anyway? Alternatively, who says men shouldn't be seeking intelligent women to marry in college? Why shouldn't men be just as concerned with finding a smart wife who can help them put a down payment on a home (and perhaps even provide them double-legacy children)? Patton also notes that men "regularly marry women who are younger, less intelligent, less educated. It's amazing how forgiving men can be about a woman's lack of erudition, if she is exceptionally pretty." Should we, as college females, tailor our behaviors and ambitions because some men are shallow? Most women at Harvard would likely answer, simply, no. We went to college to change the world, not subscribe to its bygone social mores.
 
THE TAKEAWAY
 
Patton certainly means well: She wants young, intelligent women to meet young, intelligent men, and, in her vision, all parties involved will go on to live happy, successful lives. Almost everyone at Harvard, male or female, gay or straight, ultimately seeks companionship in college, some with the hope that relationships will endure past Commencement. It's the reason we join sororities to have a cohort of sisters, and to meet boys at mixers; it's the reason DataMatch is so popular; it's the reason we have Sex Week and dating seminars to discuss how to meet people and sustain healthy relationships. It's not, however, the reason we go to college.
