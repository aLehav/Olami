After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Ryan Bliss scored, Lynah Rink roared.
In just one period of play, the No. 9/8 Harvard men’s hockey team had transformed the latest installment of college hockey’s most historic rivalry into a rout. But 14 seconds before the Crimson could close out its near-perfect opening frame, Bliss put a dent in No. 10/10 Cornell’s 3-0 deficit, and minutes into the second, Trevor Yates followed suit, injecting new life into the fish-flinging Lynah faithful.
Seven minutes later, however, sophomore defenseman Wiley Sherman put an end to the party.
Stationed just inside the blue line, the second-pair D-man wound up and blasted a one-timer past goaltender Mitch Gillam off a pass from Colin Blackwell, giving Harvard a bit of a cushion in what amounted to a convincing 6-2 victory Saturday night—its first over the Big Red since Nov. 16, 2012.
“We’ve all seen that shot in practice, but we hadn’t seen it in a game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said with a grin. “That was a big league shot.”
“It feels great, but I didn’t really do any of the work,” Sherman explained. “It was Colin Blackwell. He set me up with the feed, so I just had to shoot.”
Playing against Cornell (11-5-3, 6-4-2 ECAC) for the first time in three seasons, Blackwell set up the Sherman strike after burning a defenseman deep in the corner, giving him a four-point weekend for the second time in his career.
The fifth-year senior got his first point of the night 2:22 into the opening period, kicking off the Crimson’s early onslaught with a rip from the left circle on Harvard’s first power play. After nearly scoring from the same spot on Friday, Blackwell—who missed the two rivals’ previous four meetings with injuries—collected a rebound off his own shot and beat Gillam, marking the first of three power play goals on the night for the Crimson (11-4-3, 7-3-3).
“[Colin’s] a guy that elevates his game under the spotlight, so we’re happy to have him back,” Donato said. “He’s been through hell and back with his health issues, so it’s good to see him out there. I thought he was outstanding last night and tonight.”
Back in the lineup for the second straight night, freshman forward Michael Floodstrand followed up Blackwell’s tally at 11:06. Top-pair defenseman Brayden Jaw fired a shot from outside the right circle that Gillam got his right pad on, but the junior goaltender kicked the puck right out to Floodstrand by the far post, allowing the rookie to knock home his second goal of the season.
Two minutes later, Harvard’s co-captains upped the lead to three on the Crimson’s second power play of the night. Perched on the goal line, senior forward Jimmy Vesey found Kyle Criscuolo in the slot, and the Southampton, N.J., native netted his 14th goal of the year from his knees to put the visitors in complete command.
Harvard finished 3-for-4 on the man advantage after junior forward Luke Esposito provided a power-play dagger in the final minute of the second period, increasing the Crimson’s lead to 5-2. Harvard now ranks second in the nation with a 32 percent success rate on the man advantage.
On the opposite end of the rink, sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen had a bit of difficulty in his first career start at Lynah. Despite having to take extra shifts after losing Victor Newell to injury in the first period, the Harvard defense held the Big Red to just nine shots through the first two periods, but Madsen let two of them skip through.
Bliss got the hosts on the board, notching his first goal of the season with just 14 seconds remaining in the first, thwarting an otherwise perfect period for the Crimson. Then sophomore fourth-liner Alex Rauter set up Yates on an odd-numbered rush just over two minutes into the second to pull Cornell within one and send the packed house of over 4,000 into a frenzy.
“This rink, this atmosphere—it’s got to be one of the best, if not the best in college hockey,” Blackwell said. “The crowd makes you really get into the game immediately right from the first shift.”
Nonetheless, in front of a rejuvenated crowd, Harvard held the hosts off the board the rest of the way. Sherman’s one-timer gave the Crimson some breathing room, and Esposito put the contest out of reach from the top of the right circle at 19:33 in the second stanza. Junior forward Tyler Moy added an empty netter in the game’s final seconds.
“It was a big game, and I thought we made the plays we needed to,” Donato said.
“I’m happy for our group of seniors that gets to walk out of Lynah with their heads high,” he added. “That’s not an easy thing to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After trailing by one at halftime, the Harvard men’s basketball team came out firing in the second half of its Ivy League road opener in Hanover. Having shot just 35 percent in the first half, Harvard had 12 points in the first seven minutes of the second while holding the Big Green scoreless, taking an 11-point lead with 13:11 to go.
A minute later, Dartmouth’s second-leading scorer Miles Wright picked up his fourth foul to send senior Agunwa Okolie to the free throw line. As he headed to the bench, joining fellow Big Green standout Connor Boehm on the pine, the Crimson appeared poised to extend the lead.
However, with its reserves on the floor, Dartmouth (7-9, 1-1 Ivy League) climbed off the mat. If the ensuing 13-2 run was a shot to the gut, the 10-4 spurt that followed was the haymaker as a 38-27 lead turned into a 63-50 loss for Harvard (9-9, 1-1).
The Crimson managed just 12 points in the final 13 minutes of the game, with junior Zena Edosomwan and senior Agunwa Okolie scoring 15 of the team’s 24 second-half points. The forwards were the only Harvard players to score during a 12-minute stretch in the second half where the Crimson managed just six points.
“They didn’t pack it in or fold, they kept fighting and that’s what happens when you keep fighting,” Amaker said.
Even as Harvard built up its lead in the second half, the seeds of a comeback were sown. The Crimson committed six fouls before the second media time-out, putting Dartmouth in the bonus for the rest of the second half. However, the Big Green continued to miss shot after shot early in the game until the entrance of Malik Gill.
The senior reserve came in with Dartmouth down 11 and immediately provided a jolt of energy with his speed and quick hands. After hitting Dartmouth’s first field goal of the half with 11:28 to go, Gill stripped senior Patrick Steeves in the lane on Harvard’s next possession. A frustrated Steeves tried to poke the ball back and was called for his fourth foul, sending him to the bench.
The 53 percent shooter sunk both from the line and was at it again a minute later, stripping freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy and feeding Evan Boudreaux for a three that cut the lead to two.
After little-used reserve Taylor Johnson sent the Leede Arena crowd into a frenzy with a three for Dartmouth’s first lead of the second half, it was Gill two minutes later who gave the Big Green a lead it wouldn’t relinquish, knocking the ball away from captain Evan Cummins and streaking alone for a fast-break layup.
“When we go against him, he’s always played us exceptionally well,” Amaker said. “He’s very disruptive and he can push it transition, and he made his free throws.”
Gill’s performance was emblematic of how Dartmouth climbed back into the game—free throws and bench play. On a night when Wright had just one point, Dartmouth’s bench stepped up, outscoring Harvard’s 33-13. The Big Green also capitalized on loose referee whistles, sinking 20-of-26 attempts from the charity stripe to help out an anemic offense that shot below 40 percent from the field.
On the other side of the floor, Dartmouth’s best defense was often sending Harvard to the line. Harvard’s highest-volume shooter Edosomwan could not make the Big Green pay, making just two of 10 attempts, and as a team, Harvard shot just 30 percent from the free throw line—the worst performance of the Amaker era.
“We got an 11-point lead and then they just kind of flipped the switch and we made silly fouls,” Amaker said. “Looking at those two stats—free throw shooting and rebounding—really poor on our end and really outstanding by them.”
With Edosomwan struggling inside, the offense ground to a halt. The Crimson turned the ball over 14 times and had just three offensive rebounds as Dartmouth overpowered Harvard on the glass, finishing with a 38-26 advantage on the boards. Corbin Miller’s three with 13 minutes left proved to be the last one of the day for Harvard as a team that came in shooting 41.2 percent from deep made just four of 13 attempts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The road to a sixth consecutive Ivy League title just got tougher for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
Despite building an 11-point lead and shutting out Dartmouth (7-9, 1-1 Ivy League) through the first seven minutes of the second half, the Crimson (9-9, 1-1) went cold during a 34-10 Big Green run in the game’s final 11:40 and fell, 63-50, on Saturday night in Hanover.
PAYING AT THE FREE THROW LINE
Harvard has struggled from the free throw line all season, but never was it more on display than at Leede Arena.
The Crimson shot 6-for-20 from the charity stripe, compared to 20-of-26 shooting by the Big Green.
The most glaring errors came from forward Zena Edosomwan. The junior was shooting 50 percent from the line on the year, but made just 2-of-10 Saturday night.
Both teams went to the bonus early in the second half, and as Dartmouth worked to chip away at the Crimson’s lead, it looked to send Edosomwan to the line, which proved a safer bet than giving him a chance to score in the paint. While the junior led Harvard with 18 points, only six came in the second frame. After just one trip to the line in the first half, Edosomwan fired eight attempts after the intermission.
“He’s got to be a better finisher,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Because one, he’s two to three feet away from the basket and two, if he does get fouled, he hasn’t proven to be a good foul shooter, so we’re not cashing in when we do get opportunities to get fouled from his movements and style of play.”
While Edosomwan’s foul line struggles were the most blatant, the rest of his team struggled as well. The cold shooting from the charity stripe kicked off with sophomore Chris Egi, who missed two free throws—in line with his 25 percent shooting percentage from the line this season. Statistically, seniors Agunwa Okolie and Evan Cummins were bright spots for Harvard’s free throw shooting, both shooting 50 percent from the line—team highs, but below the team’s season average of 59 percent.
SECOND HALF BREAKDOWN
Going into the second half, Harvard still had a chance to walk away with a comfortable victory at the end of the night as Dartmouth failed to score from the field for nearly eight minutes, allowing the Crimson to build an 11-point lead.
But even with senior forward Connor Boehm, who averages over 10 points per game for the Big Green, sitting on the bench with four fouls, Harvard could not put the game out of Dartmouth’s reach.
Instead of giving Harvard a chance to take advantage of Boehm’s absence, Dartmouth’s bench did not miss a beat. Even without Boehm, who ranks third on his team in scoring with 10.8 points per game, reserves like senior guard Malik Gill and sophomore guard Taylor Johnson came off the bench to provide a spark for the Big Green. Gill and Johnson finished with 11 and 10 points, respectively, with all of the duo’s points coming in the second frame.
“He’s very disruptive and he can push it in transition, and he made his free throws,” Amaker said. “When we’ve shown up to play against Dartmouth, home or away, he’s played well.”
While Dartmouth’s bench came alive with 33 points on the night, Harvard’s entire offense went dim. Senior forward Agunwa Okolie added 13 points and junior guard Corbin Miller had 10 in addition to Edosomwan’s 18 points, but no other player on the team had more than five points. Senior guard Patrick Steeves had a particularly tough time, shooting 2-for-8 and sitting for much of the second half with four fouls.
The 50-point performance was the second-worst offensive output for Harvard this season, who scored 49 points in a one-point loss to Holy Cross in November.
