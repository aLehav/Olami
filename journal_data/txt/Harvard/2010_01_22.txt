After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A bolt of lightning splits an apple tree—the paragon of American wholesomeness—in a hallucinatory sequence at the start of the Huntington Theatre Company’s production of Arthur Miller’s “All My Sons.” The fallen symbol remains onstage for the bulk of the show as a subtle reminder of the decaying values “Sons” explores in this electric and moving production.
Running through February 7th, “All My Sons” has not felt so timely since its 1947 debut, owing in part to the current national culture of profit-hungry egocentricity. While the main action is set just after World War II, the play’s examination of capitalist greed and personal culpability is all the more relevant in today’s society.
Director David Esbjornson shrewdly recognizes this relevance and elucidates the play’s ideas for a modern audience through his effective and restrained use of video footage and dream sequences. While such contemporary touches to a firmly historical show might risk losing the substance in the spectacle, Esbjornson is careful to only use these effects to enhance the material and maintain the integrity of the play.
Miller’s writing—some of his finest—is, in fact, the star of this show. The focus here is not on style, but on the people: the community, the nuclear family, and the conflicts that tear them both apart. Esbjornson remains faithful to the playwright’s masterful work, providing the standard Midwestern backyard set and then letting the sparks fly between his skilled actors.
Yet, even this setting, the backyard of a typical two-story home owned by the model Keller family, provides subtext. The fading yellow façade and wilting gardens of this house suggest sickness and neglect, reflecting the stagnation of the three Kellers after their son Larry goes missing in action during the war.
Patriarch Joe (Will Lyman) and his surviving son Chris (Lee Aaron Rosen) are ready to move on—the latter by marrying his missing brother’s fiancée, Ann (Diane Davis), who comes to stay with the Kellers. However, Joe’s wife Kate (Karen MacDonald) rejects Larry’s presumed death because, as she says, “Certain things can never happen.”
Ann’s visit also triggers a re-examination of earlier strife surrounding the sale of defective airplane parts to the government by the company run by her father and Joe during the war. Suddenly, the troubles of the past re-surface, unable to be denied any longer. Responsibility must be taken, and natural order restored.
Kate, who dictates the family’s terms of life, generally maintains the broken, dysfunctional order. MacDonald excels as the delusional matriarch, her grief and desperation palpable in her every word. She grounds the show in its emotional core, providing some of the most devastating moments of the production. Her performance is heartbreaking and multifaceted, especially during those instances when she must confront the unsavory reality of her world.
Lyman, too, provides an intricate study of his character. His Joe is one part Mister Rogers and one part Gordon Gekko, with a hint of Vito Corleone mixed in for good measure. A suggestion of darkness hides in Lyman’s friendly neighborhood persona, the many aspects of which he effectively explores throughout the play. Lyman’s only fault is the apparent mouth full of cotton balls he possesses every time he speaks, but his diction is never so unintelligible as to be distracting.
Compared to the commanding presence of MacDonald and Lyman, the performances of Rosen and Davis as the betrothed Chris and Ann seem overpowered and artificial. Davis delivers her lines with a permanent smile affixed to her face, yet she lacks Ann’s inner strength and natural verve. Rosen is charmingly naïve, but fails to capture the depth of Chris’s changing, complex emotions. Together, the two actors have only minimal chemistry, and instead simply recite their lines at each other rather than to each other.
These weaknesses, however, do not detract from the intensity of Miller’s play and Esbjornson’s skillful direction. Esbjornson’s opening lightning-struck apple tree is eventually brought offstage: many American principles, too, have been shattered in the process, their damaged pieces ready to be reconstructed to establish a more positive national morality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget vacation. Several students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have kept themselves busy during January by designing and leading their own miniature courses for graduate students in other fields.
A number of the students offering the courses have previously served as teaching fellows or lectured to peers in their field—but for most, the mini-courses constitute a unique opportunity to draft a curriculum and conduct their own classes.
“As grad students, we get more experience grading as TFs. I wanted some teaching experience,” says Bridget A. Alex, a Human Evolutionary Biology graduate student who taught a mini-course on prehistoric history for the inaugural program.
Though Alex has not had experience being a teaching fellow, she says that older graduate students have warned her that TFs largely focus on grading and answering students’ questions about tests and homework. Alex says she found the opportunity to teach a mini-course appealing because it would give her lecture experience.
The Graduate Student Council-sponsored program of mini-courses has provided graduate students an important chance to gain experience teaching a course on their own and  perhaps even further their career goals in academia.
LEARNING BY TEACHING
Though the eight mini-courses each attracted only several consistent students, Graduate Student Council President Benjamin M. Woodring wrote in an e-mailed statement that the Council is planning to continue the program next year because it gives graduate students the opportunity to lead their own classes.
“We want it to be more of a discussion group,” says GSAS Dean for Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana, who added that the “numbers” regarding the class sizes were “not that important.”
The range of mini-courses suggests a broad appeal across disciplines, with subject areas running the gamut from textiles and modern American Jewish culture, to stem cells and experimental approaches to mathematics.
“The wide learning this program promotes is what people ideally want out of Harvard, but usually do not get because they’re overcommitted,” Woodring says.
The GSC mini-courses are part of the larger program January@GSAS, which offers a range of seminars, workshops, and extracurricular activities to graduate students. In January, ski trips to New Hampshire and courses ranging from creative writing workshops to “Massage Therapy 101: Basics of a Back Massage” were offered to graduate students.
Nine GSAS students and one post-doctoral student decided to focus on leading mini-courses in their fields of expertise.
An anonymous alumnus made a donation in the late fall to make these mini-courses possible, according to McCavana. Total funding of $4,000 was distributed to the eight courses, Woodring says, and students who did not receive funding could still teach a mini-course.
While the GSC has worked with GSAS administrators to help structure the mini-course program, faculty and administrators have taken a generally hands-off approach, according to McCavana.
DECEMBER RUSH
Students were asked to submit course ideas to the Graduate Student Selection Committee beginning Dec. 2. Students were apprised of funding decisions on Dec. 19, and they had less than a month to prepare the syllabus and lectures for their mini-courses.
GSAS student Carlos A. Blanco—who taught “Why Resurrection? An Introduction to Belief in the Afterlife in Judaism and Christianity”—says that for each two-hour class, he devoted about five hours of preparation. He says he used materials from his two dissertations in philosophy and theology to design the syllabus.
Despite the large effort necessary to run a mini-course, the teachers say the benefits exceeded the effort. Carl Erickson, who taught “Vistas in Mathematics,” says that he learned new things as he compiled an annotated bibliography and pieced together the syllabus.
Alex, who taught “History Before History: From the Origins of the Earth to the Modern Era,” says about her experience leading a course, “I reread every textbook from undergraduate and graduate school I had and picked out topics that I though were interesting in the last 13.7 billion years of the world’s history.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not common to have two Ivy League athletes hear their names called during a professional sports draft. It’s especially rare to have two players from the same school join the professional ranks on the same day. But for seniors Andre Akpan and Kwaku Nyamekye, rarity has become reality.
On Jan. 14, during the 2010 MLS SuperDraft in Philadelphia, Penn., Akpan was selected in the second round (22nd overall) by the Colorado Rapids. 2008 MLS Cup Champions Columbus Crew selected Nyamekye with the team’s first pick in the fourth round (60th overall).
During the All-Ivy pair’s tenure at Harvard, the duo led the Crimson to 52 wins, four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, and two Ivy League championships over a four-year span.
Akpan, who was projected as a first-round selection before his MLS Combine performance caused his draft stock to decline, remained relatively upbeat after waiting to hear his name called.
“It’s a dream come true,” Akpan said moments after having thanked his family, teammates, and coaches on stage. “Every [player] will tell you that the day they can stand up on that podium and be welcomed to a team in MLS.”
“I’m so excited for a new challenged and anxious to start training with the team,” Akpan added. “I’m grateful for Colorado to take a chance on me.”
Although Akpan racked up impressive accolades as a forward in college, he will join a Rapids club that is already loaded with top striking talent. Forwards Conor Casey—a member of the U.S. Men’s National Team—and Omar Cummings had 24 goals and 13 assists between them during MLS play last season. But the Rapids expect Akpan to mix in well with their current roster and hope to provide him with ample learning experience.
“I think the opportunity that Andre has in front of him is a great one,” said Colorado Rapids Technical Director Paul Bravo. “He is going to be learning from two of the best forwards in the league, and Andre has a combination of [Casey’s and Cummings’] skill sets.”
Despite being passed over by every team in the first round, Colorado, which did not have a first-round selection, jumped at the opportunity to select Akpan with its first selection in the draft.
“I don’t think we could’ve drawn it up any better,” Bravo explained. “To have guys like Andre and Ross LaBauex [the University of Virginia midfielder who the team selected right after Akpan] drop to the second round, you have to take advantage. We think we’ve struck gold with out first two picks.”
Akpan’s spot on the roster will be secure as the Hermann Trophy finalist signed a pre-draft contract with MLS. With the Rapids facing the possibility of losing Casey for an extended time if he is selected for this summer’s FIFA World Cup, Akpan may be able to provide depth and get some minutes off the bench.
“We look for a certain skill set, a body type to fit with what we’re trying to do as a club,” Bravo said. “Akpan is a big, aggressive guy who is good with his back towards goal, courageous, and a good finisher. Those are the qualities we look to in a forward.”
Colorado finished the 2009 season tied for the eighth and final playoff spot, but lost out on tiebreakers to the eventual champion, Real Salt Lake.
Nyamekye entered college as a forward from Switzerland but in a few months will be contending for a spot on an American professional soccer club as a defender. The four-time All-Ivy defender joins a Crew club with a recent history of drafting Ivy alums.
Columbus selected University of Pennsylvania product Alex Grendi last year. A long shot to make the final roster, Grendi played in three games for the club last season and recorded one assist.
Nyamekye impressed at the MLS Combine with his combination of physical prowess and raw talent, but speculation that he would seek professional offers in Europe pushed his draft stock down.
Reports out of Scotland suggest that Nyamekye has been offered a trial with storied Scottish club Rangers FC, but it has not been confirmed. Nyamekye could not be reached for comment.
This marks the second consecutive year that two Ancient Eight players were selected in the MLS SuperDraft—last year Grendi and Michael Fucito ’08-’09 carried the Ivy torch. Akpan is the second-highest Crimson player to be drafted—Will Kohler ’97 was selected 15th overall by the MetroStars in 1997—and the fifth Harvard player all-time to be drafted. Nyamekye is the first Crimson defensive player to be selected.

With spring semester fast approaching, the time has come to revisit a number of unfortunate but inevitable facts about life at Harvard, ranging from the dreary New England weather to the fact that some of your TFs this semester might not speak understandable English. And new classes mean that, once again, we will each have to spend a sum of cash that could probably feed a small Third World community for a year on textbooks that we'll never look at again once the semester has ended.
But wait, there's hope! Beren Professor of Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw stated on his popular blog that his Ec 10 textbook (along with 1,200 other titles) can now be rented from Cengage Brain, in either physical or digital form, at prices much lower than retail cost. Approximately 1,500 more titles are set to be added by July, and students can also purchase individual e-chapters as needed.
But is it really a good deal? After all, you're still spending a little more than half of the purchase price of a new copy of Principles of Economics for one that you won't be able to resell (or for the right to look at a digital version on your tiny laptop screen for a year). Maybe, if you don't mind using an older edition, you should go with the old-fashioned used book route: we found a copy of the fourth edition on AbeBooks for about $30.

With the freshman formal only a week away, some Yard residents may be suffering from a last-minute dateless panic. Well, ladies, fear not because it looks like Freeze Magazine overlooked someone in their list of candidates for Mr. Harvard Freshman 2013—and he is now accepting applications to be his date.
In an e-mail that the author said was sent to almost the entire freshman class Saturday night, Sean W. Pohorence '13 detailed his eligibility for those still in search of an escort to the Snow Ball. With credentials such as “a formidable stamp collection” and the inspiring goal of someday becoming a "football player doctor astronaut," it is quite obvious why girls may have been too intimidated to ask him in person.
To give you a sense of this guy, here are some of his qualifications, straight from his e-mail:
I once needed to tell Bob Marley to relax.
I founded the Nobel Prize, the Polio vaccine, and France.
I can draw a perfect circle with my left hand.
I am right handed.
I know every language (including parseltongue), but then again I should since I invented them.
Pohorence said he already received a number of replies, five or six of which were really good.
“I wasn’t really sure what I wanted out of this, maybe just to see if it could be done, but the responses have made the whole thing worth it,” he said. As to whether or not he will notify the list when he has chosen a winner, that remains to be seen.
Like in the Harvard admissions process, applications aren't admitted on a rolling basis. For those of you who were intimidated by a 7 percent Harvard acceptance rate last year, think carefully about your odds of winning this contest. Yeah, that's right, we're saying that the competition for Sean Pohorence is fierce and only one can win. Before you waste your time on an application (the deadline is today), check out our submission to make sure you know what you're up against:
Hey Sean,
I have seen Dane Cook get struck by a vehicle.
Ernest Hemingway wrote romance novels until I broke his heart.
I once tutored Noam Chomsky on grammar.
I eat 12 servings of fruits and vegetables a minute.
The man who screeches in the fake Gap ad is unable to contain himself because I had just told him I liked his sweater.
No one thought that John Nash’s mind was beautiful until I painted it.
Joseph’s coat would still be drab and without dreams had I not given him fashion advice.
I once challenged God to a contest in who could make a superior being. He made Sarah Palin. I made Chuck Norris.
I taught Michael Jackson his ABCs.
You know you love me. XOXO.
