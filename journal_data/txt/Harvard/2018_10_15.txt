After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It’s incredible you got into Harvard — especially with its racist admission policies!”
I heard the sentiment of this impassioned exclamation all too frequently in the months following my acceptance. Everyone guilty of saying it meant well. They probably even believed that the last bit — the one that never failed to provoke an internal grimace — strengthened the compliment, elevating the gravity of my achievement. Of course, I’d happily accept the praise if the sentiments fueling it didn’t have the potential to harm other equally-deserving Harvard hopefuls. Unfortunately, that potential remains strong, more so now than ever. During this important political moment, I implore, from one Asian-American to another: Back off of affirmative action.
Race-based admissions policies have sparked conflict for as long as they’ve existed, but the controversy surrounding Harvard has recently thrust them back into the spotlight. In 2014, Students for Fair Admissions filed a closely-watched lawsuit accusing Harvard of discrimination against Asian-American applicants. The case, which cites practices such as the newly-discovered use of “personal” ratings as an admissions factor, has just been given the go-ahead to proceed to trial.
As an Asian-American who recently completed the college applications process, I’m tempted to join the angry throngs of my fellow peers, calling for an end to a system that we believe is rigged against us. After all, the case — at least on a surface level — appears perfectly reasonable, even deserving of serious consideration: Indisputable data shows that Asian-Americans were consistently rated lower than other students when it came to “positive personality” traits, and far fewer of them are admitted than would be if academics were the sole criteria. However, despite the movement’s emotional appeal and personal significance, we need to look past our own myopic perspectives and withdraw our collective support.
The sinister truth is that while the lawsuit in question only targets Harvard explicitly, its controversial nature and past behavior of its litigator means it’s likely to be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court. There, the conservative majority would likely dismantle the architecture of race-conscious admissions policies — something that any diversity- and equality-valuing community should defend at all costs. In fact, destroying affirmative action writ-large has long been the end goal of Edward Blum, who leads Students for Fair Admissions. This white conservative activist is spearheading the lawsuit against Harvard — a fact that on its own should generate skepticism towards its merits, especially in an audience of color like ours.
Blum’s logic was wrong when arguing a similar case in Fisher v. University of Texas, and it’s wrong here, too. The allegation of “racial balancing,” or rejecting more qualified Asian-American applicants in favor of less qualified black or Latinx ones, can only be compelling to someone with a naively idealistic conception of the school system, and of equal opportunity in America more generally. While a complete meritocracy sounds like a good idea, it necessitates the equality of all other factors, especially resources. This couldn’t be further from the truth — a study of the 2011-2012 school year found that while 81 percent of Asian-American students had access to college-preparatory math and science courses, only 57 percent of black students enjoyed the same privileges. Such disparities exist throughout the educational sphere, problematizing the very idea of a world without racial considerations. If college admissions were based on merit alone, black students would have a disproportionately mammoth task ahead of them: not only ensuring that they meet Harvard’s standards, but overcoming unfair resource distribution to do so. That would undoubtedly cause their level of representation to plummet at elite universities, recalling an era of near-segregation as prestige becomes an excuse for racism.
A common source of confusion for Asian-Americans — at least many within my own community — is that we’re also people of color and have our fair share of negative experience stemming from that identity. Therefore, our logic goes, affirmative action should intuitively benefit us, too. However, it’s important to recognize the complicated intersections of privilege and oppression: They aren’t mutually exclusive. While the model minority myth does generate plenty of negative stereotypes and place an undue burden on Asian-Americans, it also provides us with a sense of legitimacy in society that isn’t often afforded to other minorities. The structures of white supremacy view us as smart and hardworking, a perception that harms us in some ways, but translates into material benefits when it comes to employment and education. For example, the unemployment rate for Asian Americans is over 30 percent lower than that of the black community. Moreover, Asian-Americans’ median household income is 39 percent higher than the national average.
This isn’t to paper over the trials of the Asian-American experience. The “personal” rating factor definitely raises some questions about how the model minority myth can work to our disadvantage. Obviously, judging the personality of applicants is an intrinsically subjective — and therefore, inevitably flawed — practice. Given its adverse effects on Asian-Americans, it’s important for admissions officers to confront their subconscious biases: We can be smart and we can be hardworking, but we shouldn’t be reduced to those traits. However, recognizing that racism can affect how Asian Americans are perceived in college admissions cannot, and should not, be a referendum on the entire structure of race-based admissions policies. The overwhelming tendency to conflate the two simply feeds white supremacy by dividing people of color.
I know as well as anyone how draining the college admissions process is. The sting of rejection makes it tempting to find a scapegoat, and affirmative action presents itself as the obvious choice. But we, as a people that both enjoy privilege and lack it, have a responsibility to ourselves and other communities of color.
Affirmative action needs our support. It’s time that we give it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quickly into my Harvard career, I learned that Harvard students do things differently. Here, handshakes are not reserved for business deals; they’re the customary greeting upon meeting another 18-year-old college kid. Across campus, you’re just as likely to find kids passing blunts as business cards. After meeting someone, you can expect a request to connect on LinkedIn in place of a follow-up text. Think you’d never get asked about your SAT or Advanced Placement scores after completing the college application process? That’s a cute aspiration.
At worst, I find these modes of communication mildly irritating, mostly off-putting. At best, I appreciate the explicit signal warning me that I should never be friends with their proponents. As a senior, I’ve become accustomed to the student body-wide obsession with social climbing and status as reflected in everyday conduct. But one common question has unwaveringly irked me: What do your parents do?
Growing up, the question only ever surfaced in school documents rather than in peer-to-peer discussion. Back home in Philadelphia, we make conversation about the weather, perennially late public transportation, and the Eagles’ Super Bowl prospects. My schooling placed me alongside kids with parents in both blue-collar and white-collar professions, but nobody cared about how other people’s parents made their money.
I can’t recall the first time at Harvard I was asked that question because it’s happened so many times. I learned to dress up my father’s occupation of “truck driver” as “My dad works at a hunger relief organization.” Both are true, yet the second meets the dignified expectations of upper-middle-class culture. Growing up without a mother forced me to be aware of the assumptions inherent in other people’s questions, particularly that everyone has two parents. I usually ignored the plural case and hope the inquirer would get the hint. Recently, to my response I’ve added “My mother’s dead, so she doesn’t do anything,” because I revel in making people justifiably uncomfortable.
I don’t carry shame about my socioeconomic status or how I grew up — at least not consciously or as much as I used to. I dislike this questions so much because being asked about what my parents do feels like I’m being put on trial. It’s like I’m going to be judged based on a host of factors out of my control: how much money my parents make, and the activities, experiences, and lifestyle made possible or unimaginable because of that income. As if how people with whom I share DNA spend their nine-to-five is supposed to dictate whether I am a good person, whether I am worthy of the time and attention of the person asking this question. Typically, the only people quizzing others about parental employment are people who have “appropriate” or “impressive” answers.
As a freshman, I attended a three-day social justice organizing workshop at Harvard during January break. The leaders, all “conscious” and “intentional” lefty grad students, introduced themselves with their parents’ professions. Every single one of them followed their name with some two-parent, high income response like “My dad is a professor,” or “My mom is an astrophysicist.” I wondered how the room would react to responses reflective of some populace beyond our ivied gates, like “My mother does drugs,” or “I’ve never met my father,” or “My parents are in prison.” When we broke into small groups and told our life stories, my group leader told me I was defining myself too much by things my parents had done.
Of course what our parents do has an affect on us. If my parents were professors, I wouldn’t have made the observations that led me to write this article. Worth noting is why we might prioritize some information over others. Perhaps we’re just class obsessed. Maybe we believe knowing what one’s parents do will allow us to make assumptions that will help us best to understand the respondent. While income and industry might reveal a lot about how someone grew up, the most telling aspect of the conversation might be our own judgements about the answer.
Most of us don’t ask about what traumas our peers’ childhoods created. We don’t request to know how adults in their lives managed their emotions or reacted to life’s stresses. But such queries will tell us just as much about others as the “What do your parents do?” question. Parents of all socioeconomic classes do a host of things: lie, neglect their children, drink too much, cheat on their spouses. Take their kids to the park, read bedtime stories, work extra hours so their children can have easier lives than their own. Why aren’t we interested in those things?
My demand is simple: Don’t ask people what their parents do. If your verbal and mental itch to inquire into their occupational past overwhelms you, ask yourself why! How would not knowing the industries in which someone’s parents work affect your life? Would lacking that knowledge affect your ability to connect with them? Would knowing alter your judgement of them? If “What do your parents do?” feels like an indispensable question in your conversational toolkit, it’s time to learn new ways of relating to and understanding people.
You can ask some more innocuous questions instead. How do you hang toilet paper rolls? Have you ever tried saying “Bloody Mary” three times with your bathroom lights off? Do you put ketchup on hot dogs? These questions will tell you all you need to know about the respondents’ values, respect for law and order, and sense of basic human decency. No parental occupation required.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a public hearing Tuesday, the City of Cambridge announced that it had made significant progress towards achieving its so-called “Zero Waste” goals and other sustainability initiatives pertaining to recycling and composting, aiming to drastically cut the amount of waste that Cantabrigians send to landfills.
The success of this program should serve as motivational evidence that local efforts to protect the environment can pay great dividends. We hope that our fellow Cantabrigians also appreciate their direct impact, such as the million-plus pounds of organic trash diverted from landfills in the first six months of this program alone.
We’re similarly glad to also see Harvard’s own progress in minimizing waste. According to the 2017 Harvard Sustainability Report, per capita waste decreased 44 percent from 2006 levels. Given that conservation is a common interest of both the city and the University, these twin successes are a strong testament to what can be accomplished when the two work together. Since high levels of waste are harmful to all community members, it is of tantamount importance to ensure widespread participation from city residents to make sure that our progress is sustained and built upon in the future.
Nevertheless, given that seven of 20 state landfills in Massachusetts are closing, we must also keep in mind that waste reduction going forward will be a necessity, and not simply a lifestyle choice. In order to create this mentality shift, the next generation must be aware of environmental protection efforts’ global importance. Widespread educational programs in public schools and other city-sponsored programs would go a long way in ensuring that young Cantabrigians are equally committed to waste reduction.
Such programs have proven effective in Hong Kong, and could potentially result in similar mindset shifts in citizens here. Additionally, since schools themselves can be a major source of waste, educational programs specifically targeted at public schools may reduce waste immediately.
Cambridge is a city of highly educated and motivated citizens. While Harvard and Cambridge’s progress to date deserves praise, we must not rest on our collective laurels. Going forward, we should do our best to effect change on the state, national, and even global scale. Given the number of Harvard alumni who go on to serve in national leadership, we believe that a greater focus on the importance of waste management and environmental protection from the University might impact some of those future leaders.
We hope that residents across Cambridge learn that they have the capability to create change on a local scale. Climate change often feels like a hopelessly insurmountable problem, and this may paralyze us. Yet when we start small, by composting or recycling more, we can build a measurably greener and cleaner city — and perhaps world.

It was not out of character for former Harvard President Charles W. Eliot — a white-haired, bespectacled man partial to a priest’s high collar — to predict the suicide of the Anglo-Saxon race. During his presidential tenure he regularly decried racial mixing and spoke in praise of eugenics. Two years before his death in 1926, he declared that the one of the chief risks for race suicide was this: “The idea held by some of the modern young women, that marriage is not the most important thing in life.” Ironically, his audience was a roomful of married young women, the wives of Harvard undergraduate and graduate students.
“I hope you all realize that no career offers the happiness, the hopefulness, and the contentedness, which being the mother of a family gives,” Eliot said.
Eliot was hardly the first speaker to address this group — called “The Society of Harvard Dames” — on the topic of matrimony. Anna P. Lowell, wife of former Harvard President Abbott L. Lowell, founded the group in 1896 to promote “acquaintance and social fellowship among its members.” Much of this fellowship took place in the lecture room, and many of the lectures covered how to be a woman and a wife.
The lecture topics evolved over the twentieth century. In 1925, Miss Alice Bradley spoke on “Intelligent Housekeeping.” In 1951, the wives were “fascinated and delighted to hear” Harvard architecture professor Jean P. Carlhian weigh in on the subject, “Can Mrs. Blandings Build her Dream House?” In 1962, Mary B. Newman, the first woman to win a seat in the state legislature, gave a talk titled, “Is Politics for Us?” and eight years later the Dames hosted the “Take It Off Girl” — a Swedish model, actress, and feminist named Gunilla Knutson who became famous for her daring “take it all off” shaving commercials.
But for much of its history, the Harvard Dames and its analog groups across the University — Business School Wives and Law School Wives — engaged in largely domestic work. The tea committee was prolific and meticulous in recording its activities. A 1963 report reads, “Jan. 10: Planned for 150. Served coffee (6 gal.) and tea (2 gal.) and one-layer cakes (8x8 or 9x13 cut in squares) (14 people brought cake).”
Each new club president inherited a “Passbook” from the last, filled with decades of advice, on how to host the best teas, or how to attract the most wives for bridge club. Monthly and yearly reports celebrated the success of fashion shows, elaborate holiday parties, choral productions, and bonding events with other wives’ groups. The MIT Dames, who held weirder events, invited the Harvard Dames to attend their Stop and Shop Meat Program. “Five of us won delicious cuts of meat which were offered as prizes!” one president recorded. Club excursions to Harvard Yard at the beginning of the school year invited Dames to “come find out where your husband hangs out,” along with instructions to wear low-heeled shoes.
In his influential 1873 book “Sex in Education,” Harvard Professor Edward H. Clarke argued that intellectual pursuit and the female reproductive system were fundamentally incompatible. He offered the case study of a “Miss G----,” a New Englander who attended a Western college. “She was unable to make a good brain, that could stand the wear and tear of life, and a good reproductive system that should serve the race, at the same time that she was continuously spending her force in intellectual labor,” he wrote. “And so Miss G---- died.”
The book appeared just six years before “The Harvard Annex” was founded as a small, private institution for girls up Garden Street. Radcliffe was chartered as an official college 15 years after that in 1894. And two years after that, Anna Lowell founded the Harvard Dames.

 As Radcliffe women began to break into Harvard’s academic sphere, the Dames stuck resolutely to the domestic sphere. If the Harvard Man remained the central figure of university life over the course of the twentieth century, the Radcliffe Girl and the Harvard Wife each floated at his periphery. But where Radcliffe students came to Harvard for their own educational purposes, the wives’ arrival was incidental to their husbands’ scholarship.
In the late twentieth century, against the backdrop of second-wave feminism, some Radcliffe women saw the traditionally feminine functions of the Dames as frivolous and archaic. While a Harvard undergraduate, Amanda P. Bennett ’75, opined in The Crimson that “[t]here is an enormous difference between attending a fashion show (if you like them) with a friend to relax, and relaxing at a fashion show in order to make friends.”
She continued, “Even though the factors that necessitate the existence of a group of women like the Dames can be readily understood, the existence of a group of women only for the purpose of meeting other women socially certainly cannot be praised, even faintly.”
Poet and feminist Adrienne Rich ’51 was both a Radcliffe student and, later, the wife of Harvard professor Alfred H. Conrad ’47. In an interview with The Crimson in 1973, she argued that female undergraduates suffered as much misogyny as the wives who shared their campus. “These equal chances, equal opportunities, this ready acceptance—it’s all an illusion and a lie. They’re not nearly aware of the ways in which they’re being taken,” she said.
There were those who would always see the two groups, wives and female students, as one and the same. Radcliffe President Wilbur K. Jordan founded the Jordan Co-operative House in 1961 because he thought it would teach necessary skills for life after Radcliffe College — namely, cooking and cleaning. At the dedication ceremony, he told the first residents, “Cooperative living is an experience not unconnected with the process of an education and what excellent wives [Radcliffe students] will make.”
Though teas and parties were central activities to wives’ groups in their early years, wives also performed significant labor to support their husbands’ scholarship.
During World War II, as American women slipped through new openings in previously impenetrable employment fields, Harvard wives followed suit. In 1946, Harvard’s student body consisted almost entirely of veterans. That was the year Mabel E. Baker, sometimes called “Dean of Wives,” took over the just-established Bureau of Veterans’ Wives office. Under Baker’s 21-year reign, the office was simply referred to as “Harvard Wives.”
Baker found employment for young wives while husbands pursued their studies. “It’s [sort] of hard on [the wife] for a while but after [the husband] finishes his education she can relax,” she said in 1953. She coached husbands to give up their “false pride” about their wives’ full-time jobs. She pointed wives toward affordable housing, recommended pediatricians, and doled out tips for bargain shopping. She provided counseling services to married student-couples. People seeking babysitting services could call Baker’s office, and she’d connect them to a wife. If a woman came in with a peculiar skill she wished to monetize — meat-wrapping, horse training — Baker would try her best to find her a client.
“Harvard Wives” shut down in 1967, but the University’s Information Center kept a list of wives who offered specific services, such as childcare and typing, for those who still needed them.
In March 2017, the hashtag #ThanksForTyping trended on Twitter, aggregating acknowledgement pages in which male scholars thanked their wives for typing, editing, researching, and even translating academic works. Caitlin O. Casiello, a graduate of Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, tweeted about her 2013 convocation in Sanders Theater, when a dean described how his wife had typed his dissertation and advised students to get married. Casiello identifies as a bisexual woman, and same-gender marriage was not yet legal in the U.S. “Of course, if I were to marry a man, he would likely not perform that sort of labor for me,” Casiello told The Crimson in an email.
Instances of uncredited academic labor predated even Baker’s “Harvard Wives” and World War II. From 1877 to 1919, the Harvard astronomer Edward C. Pickering employed a rotating cast of over 80 woman assistants. They worked as computers to handle the massive amounts of data that Pickering’s research at the Harvard Observatory produced. Several made significant scientific contributions. Williamina P. Fleming, originally Pickering’s maid, conducted research that prompted the discovery of White Dwarf stars. Nevertheless, the women were referred to collectively, by the moniker “Pickering’s Harem.”
I saw the best minds of my gender destroyed
by marrying Harvard professors, starving
intellectually repressed, well-dressed, willing
themselves through one reception after
another... 
These are the opening lines to “Harvard Wives,” a poem by Mia You. Now a lecturer at Universiteit Utrecht in the Netherlands, You wrote the poem in 2016 while living in Cambridge with her husband, a Harvard professor. At the time she was working on a Ph.D. at University of California, Berkeley, but in an email to The Crimson, she writes that she was always asked about her husband’s research before her own.
In 2013, she tried to enter Widener Library with her infant daughter strapped to her chest, only to be turned away from the stacks by a college-aged man who cited children in the stacks as a security issue. You wrote a blog post about the incident, and a few days later, Harvard Library revised its policy on allowing children into the stacks.
Still, You was struck by the enduring resonance of a passage written by Rich in her 1976 book “Of Woman Born,” describing her own years as a Harvard wife.
Rich wrote, “The life of a Cambridge tenement backyard swarming with children, the repetitious cycles of laundry, the night-wakings, interrupted moments of peace or of engagement with ideas... I did not then understand that we … were expected to fill both the part of the Victorian Lady of Leisure, the Angel in the House, and also of the Victorian cook, scullery maid, laundress, governess and nurse.”
Returning to Harvard in 1973, Rich told The Crimson in an interview, “Coming back here, I’m very conscious of the way the careers of men are built on bright and brilliant wives who do everything for them. The parties, the contacts, typing their manuscripts, doing their research... So the women fragment their own lives and throw away careers they could have had.”
In accompanying their husbands to Harvard, many women abandoned not only their careers, but also their countries. The 1950s saw the rise of the “Cosmopolitan Club,” a Dames committee established to accommodate an influx of international wives. The club showed movies to illustrate American culture: “Welcome to Washington,” “Fabulous Florida,” and “This is Louisiana,” to name a few. In return, international wives hosted tortilla- and sushi-making sessions.
In many ways, the Cosmopolitan Club is all that remains of the Harvard Dames, which has entered the 21st century rebranded as the gender-neutral Harvard Students’ Spouses and Partners Association (HSSPA). According to President Aparna Sethi, today’s partners are overwhelmingly international, and the club functions as a support group as its members face drastic career, familial, and cultural changes.
Sethi, for example, moved from India to the United States in 2016 after marrying her husband, who completed his post-doctoral studies at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Medical School. In India, Sethi lived in a large, joint-family home. She was a school principal with a Ph.D. in Literature. In America, she found herself alone often, with a visa that did not permit her to work.
“It was not easy,” Sethi says. “You are alone at home and figuring out your life and not knowing what to do.” Leading HSSPA is Sethi’s antidote.
Digging through the Harvard Dames’ archival files, it’s difficult to glean the emotional experiences of the Dames’ social and domestic activities, to read pleasure or sacrifice into so many lists of party arrangements.
One early Dames President, passing down a list of organizational responsibilities to her successor, called the position the most rewarding job she had ever had, before instructing, “Request that each girl bring a certain amount of cookies to each meeting.”
Not all wives shared her enthusiasm. In 1936 wives of the Class of 1912 started a mutiny when they tried to boycott their husbands’ 25th reunion. “The Wives would rather die than go to the Reunion,” one wife wrote under a pseudonym. “They didn’t want to be paraded around like so many hogs at a state fair. They didn’t want to meet any more Harvard men, they had met enough.” In the end, though, they relented, and attended the reunion.
Over a century after the Dames’ founding, men and women are admitted to Harvard’s schools at about equal rates. Although today’s partners’ clubs have abandoned their “Wives” status, the change is more in name than composition.
At the Law School, female-identifying students now outnumber male-identifying students, but the former Wives’ Club — rebranded as the Harvard Law Couples and Families Association (HLCFA) — is still almost entirely female. Its president, Joanna P. Abaroa-Ellison, says about five men participate in the group’s events each year, usually accompanying a female partner who attends the Law School, or as a “one-off thing.”
She speculates that the group’s activity offerings, like book clubs, appeal more to women. But the Harvard Business School Partners’ Club attends Celtics and Bruins games, cider-tasting events, and brewery tours — and still has low male representation. Liudmyla Goncharenko, the group’s president, estimates that there are currently 10 or fewer male members out of up to 150 partners. One man sits on their leadership team — elected after the club specifically set aside a slot for a man to fill.
“When we [male partners] did participate, we were viewed as an oddity,” says Dana Milbank, who was briefly involved with the group in 1997 when his wife was a student at the Business School. He and a few other male partners splintered off to form a tongue-in-cheek rival group called the “Harvard University Male Partners’ Club,” or HUMP — though, as Milbank says, “We [didn’t] actually meet.”
The stagnant gender demographics of the partners’ clubs might simply be due to inertia: the convening of wives has been long institutionalized. The phenomenon of a man following a female partner to graduate school is relatively recent in the history of higher education, whereas its reverse is centuries old.
“Many women were also academics who were exactly on par, or once even more promising, academically with their husbands,” Mia You wrote in her email. “But due to having children, and having to prioritize one career [or] income over another, ended up as ‘Harvard wives.’”
As You puts in her poem, these are women who “debate the U.S. / intervention in Syria with Stephen Greenblatt and Steven / Pinker based on what they’ve all read in The New Yorker.” Or, these women are “parenthetical asides / reciting from memory the abstracts / of their husbands’ latest publications and examining / red lipstick on napkins in search of something / wholly their own.”

On July 20, the electric scooter company Bird blanketed the streets of Cambridge and Somerville with over 100 dockless chaos machines. The corporation did not ask the City Council’s permission, of course, because in a world where civic responsibility is subsumed under a mindless economic engine there is nothing for Big Scooter to do but disrupt and destroy, chewing a fragmented society over and over like a mother Bird masticating worms for her mewling young.
Riding a Bird scooter is as easy as 1-2-3! One: swallow all of your pride like a pelican gulping down a floppy squid and stare with your beady, soulless eyes at the Bird you wish to mount. Two: unlock the Bird with the app, you mindless automaton, you soulless robot, you husk of flesh which requires transportation.
Like a Canada goose driven by a genetic urge to migrate, forces outside of your control are driving you to ride this patwhetic electric scooter down the bike lane like a coward. Three: just leave the Bird scooter wherever you want, because there is no reason to be responsible! Like a long-tailed tit using its beak to crack open a nut and eat the succulent nutmeat, the Bird corporation is cracking the shell of American culture and eating all the juicy tidbits that have not yet decayed. Everything is meaningless, actions are completely divorced from consequences, and a contract laborer is there to clean up after you.
What is it like to ride a Bird? You enter a state of total resignation, much like how Abraham must have felt when he was about to sacrifice his only son Isaac on the altar. The brakes will work, or they won’t. The oncoming traffic will stay in its lane, or it won’t. And here you stand, unprotected in the vast sea of chance, looking for an impossible guarantee of safety like a penguin looking for ice in a warming sea. Penguins, like the human spirit, are occasionally consumed by orcas. Think about that.
But even for those brave few who resist our new scooter overlords, the world is forever changed when the Bird comes home to roost. Pedestrians must dodge the speeding electric harbingers of death in both the physical world and the ideological one, resisting the decadence and depravity the Bird invites while also protecting their very lives. But the strongest spears are forged in the hottest flames, and Big Bird better remember that.
Shortly after the July 20 scooter invasion, the normally weak and degenerate city council bucked up to Big Scooter and filed a cease-and-desist order, forcing out the foul faux-fowl. But do not mistake such a move for bravery. The folly of the scooter cultists was not their descent upon our streets with whining value-destroying death machines, but their failure to file the proper paperwork. The Bird corporation will not be deterred by such petty distractions. The Birds will be back with a vengeance soon. They are circling above, like vultures eying a soon-to-be carcass. The populace must remain vigilant, else the breadcrumbs of peace will be devoured by the Birds.

The day before a lawsuit challenging Harvard's admissions practices heads to a high-stakes and high-profile trial in a Boston courtroom, hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Cambridge and Boston Sunday to hold two dueling rallies — one pro-Harvard and one pro-Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing the University. 
SFFA filed suit against Harvard in 2014, charging that the College's race-conscious admissions policy has led the school to discriminate against Asian-American applicants. Harvard has repeatedly and strongly denied all allegations of discrimination — and a number of students, alumni, and other universities have lined up behind the University. SFFA, by contrast, has earned the support of the federal government; the Department of Justice has twice intervened in the suit in SFFA's favor.
Pro-Harvard demonstrators gathered in Harvard Square Sunday, while SFFA's backers convened in Copley Square. Follow along with live updates from Crimson reporters spread around the city below.
***
Oct. 14, 2018, 2:47 p.m., Copley Square:
At 2:47 p.m., the man of the moment appeared.
Students for Fair Admissions president and conservative litigant Edward Blum stepped behind the microphone in Copley Square, drawing applause and cheers of “Thank you, Edward!” from the crowd.
The lawsuit against Harvard marks the latest effort in Blum’s decades-long career of anti-affirmative action advocacy. Since 2008, Blum has sponsored a series of cases that sought to change the way American colleges and universities admit students.
“Let me be clear: The mission of Students for Fair Admissions is to end racial classifications and preferences in college admissions,” Blum said Sunday. “When you treat and judge individuals differently because of their race, it frays the social fabric of a college campus, which will ultimately fray the social fabric of a nation.”
Blum pointed to Harvard’s history of racial discrimination in its admissions process, noting that the school set a cap on the number of Jewish matriculants in the early twentieth century. SFFA had previously asked that evidence related to the University's past anti-Semitism be permitted in court; Harvard, however, argued the 1920s-era policies are not relevant to the College's admissions system today.
In pre-trial proceedings held in early October, Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled evidence related to the episode will be allowed in court in a “very limited” capacity.
“During the next three weeks, the court and the world will learn how Harvard has systematically discriminated against Asian-American applicants for years,” Blum said. “Sadly, this is now a new phenomenon: the history of Harvard’s holistic discriminatory practices goes back nearly 100 years.”
Blum concluded by saying he will keep fighting no matter how Burroughs ultimately rules.

Oct. 14, 2:48 p.m., Copley Square: 
Zoey Lee, a ninth grader from Boston University High School, was among the first to speak at the pro-SFFA rally in Copley Square Sunday. She said she hopes to benefit from “equal opportunities” when she applies to college and that she objects to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies.
“There are many young Asians who are gritty and determined. There are many young Asian Americans who have a great personality,” she said.
Another speaker, Kelley A. Babphavong '20, canvassed possible alternatives to race-based admissions. She suggested Harvard could weighs applicants' socieoconomic status in a race-blind manner instead.
“It is not mutually exclusive to advocate for diversity while also openly criticizing Harvard for discriminating against a specific racial group,” she said. “Being Asian at Harvard is not easy, and I hope that the eradication of Harvard’s current admissions policies will allow Asians to no longer be discriminated against."
Jacob J. Verrey ’19 took the stage after Babphavong. He said he believes Harvard lacks ideological and socioeconomic diversity, and that, because of this, Harvard’s vaunted diversity “exists on a largely superficial level.”
“Harvard ought to recognize that skin color is not a substitute for life story,” he said.
As the crowd began to thin, college admissions consultant Vijay Chokal-Ingam — the brother of actress Mindy Kaling — approached the microphone. He spoke about how he “scammed” admissions officers by pretending to be a black student while applying to medical school.
In wide-ranging remarks, Chokal-Ingam also advised Asian-American high schoolers to check off the “prefer not to say” option in lieu of listing their race on college applications and called for the resignation of Harvard's Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons '67. At several points in Chokal-Ingam's speech, members of the audience shouted, “Shame, Harvard.”

Oct. 14, 2:45 p.m., Copley Square:
As the pro-SFFA rally stretched into its third hour, Middletown, Conn. zoning and planning board member Tyrell Brown mounted the stage to lecture the audience about the importance of the Harvard admissions trial. Brown noted he is the youngest black Republican ever elected to office in Connecticut.
“We must take note that instances like this are happening each and every day at universities across this great nation," he said.
Standing in the audience, Kenneth Xu — a student at Davidson College who said he has written about the admissions suit for the Federalist and other publications — said he and other demonstrators are not here to simply “to file a lawsuit.”
“This is not about getting into college, this is about something bigger," Xu said. “We have a chance to set an example, a guiding light for the rest of the nation to follow.”

Oct. 14, 2:33 p.m., Copley Square:
Donning a Harvard athletics sweatshirt, Harvard College and Medical School graduate Samuel T. Wong '84 said he traveled to Copley Square Sunday because he thinks the College's admissions process is far too opaque.
“I’m supporting fairness and transparency, not Asians in particular,” Wong said. “I think there is a lot of obfuscation in this whole thing and the numbers I do think speak for themselves.”
Wong, a former freshman proctor at the College, called SFFA's lawsuit against his alma mater “good noise.”
“I think it raises a lot of noise — it’s good noise and I’m not into banners or oversimplifications but I believe it is a good noise and a necessary noise because I know too many people who are really the best citizens of America who were rejected by Harvard and I don’t even know them, but I felt their pain,” Wong said.

Oct. 14, 1:51 p.m., Copley Square:
Swan Lee, a board member of the Asian American Coalition for Education, severely criticized Harvard and its race-conscious admissions policies in opening remarks she gave at the Copley Square rally — earning claps and cheers from the audience.
“You can tell us apart because of your own ignorance,” Lee said. “If you want to help non-white students, start respecting them.”
About 30 minutes into the rally, things got political. Protesters hung a sign reading "Thank You President Trump 4 Meritocracy" along St. James Avenue. Later, demonstrators hoisted a banner reading “Chinese Americans [Love] Trump.”
Kathy Zhu, a student at the University of Central Florida, stood proudly in front of the “Meritocracy” sign Sunday afternoon. Asked whether she believes this case will go to the Supreme Court, she did not hesitate.
“Absolutely,” Zhu said.

Oct. 14, 12:31 p.m., Copley Square:
Over 250 people are now massed in Copley Square to protest Harvard's race-conscious admissions policies. Demonstrators have stuck anti-Harvard posters — including one “Race is not for bargain" — on fences around the square.
Ally Wang, the wife of a Harvard Medical School professor, said she traveled from New Haven, CT to attend Sunday's rally. Wang said she has two sons: one five-year-old and one 10-year-old.
But she says could care less whether her children get into Harvard or not.
“I don’t really care if my children go to Harvard or not — we probably even kind of have legacy because my husband works for Harvard —but the way Harvard is doing it really hurts,” Wang said.
Wang said she is rallying to protest Harvard's admissions policies because she dislikes the way the College evaluates Asian students' success during the interview process. Documents released over the summer as part of the lawsuit showed that Harvard admissions officers tend to give Asian-American applicants lower scores for "personal traits" like grit and humor than they do applicants of other races.
“I feel it’s very, very unfair,” Wang said. “And I’m offended. I’m offended. Anybody would be.”

Oct. 14, 12:24 p.m., Copley Square: 
Hoisting signs reading “Harvard Stop Asian Quota” and “Harvard No More Racial Stereotyping,” protestors have gathered in Copley Square to rally in support of Students for Fair Admissions.
Alex Xia, who wielded a sign reading “Support SFFA Fair Admissions for All,” said he's spent time researching college admissions — and that the results of that research drove him to demonstrate Sunday.
“I do feel like Harvard is unfairly treating Asian-Americans in the application process,” Chin said. “When you see injustice, you have to stand up and protest.”
Sunny Zhao, who stood alongside Xia, said he thinks the admissions processes at Harvard is very unfair to students of Asian descent.
“Look at my children. Look at the people here’s children. Our children study so hard,” Zhao said. “Their hard work is not as appreciated. Why? It’s just because we are Asian. That’s unfair.”

Oct. 14, 12:11 p.m., Harvard Square:
Addressing a near-silent crowd, Harvard doctoral student Gregory Davis and the Harvard Temporary Protected Status Coalition's Doris Reina-Landaverde stepped behind the microphone to defend diversity and affirmative action.
"This is what we're meant to be here for," Davis said. "This is how we make Harvard better, and this is what's right."
Reina-Landaverde also spoke about issues including immigrant rights and unionization. At times she grew visibly emotional and almost unable to speak through tears, which she acknowledged to roars of approval from the crowd.
"I'm so sorry," she said. "It's hard for me — talking about how we suffer here in Harvard, and how when we put in complaints to Harvard, Harvard bosses say 'You don't tell me what I have to say. I'm the boss and I do what I want.'"

Oct. 14, 12:09 p.m., Copley Square:
Over 100 people have gathered in Copley Square bearing signs reading “I Am Asian American, I Have A Dream Too” and “My Race Should Not Hurt Me In Admissions.”

Members of the Asian American Rights Association, a Seattle-based group, said they traveled across the country to attend the rally. Ying-Chao Liu, a member of the group, said the battle over Harvard's admissions policies and the upcoming trial reflect “the real concerns of Asian Americans.”

“We are against discrimination, not only at Harvard, but in the K-12 system as well,” Liu said. “This is paramount to all Asian Americans and will have a long-lasting impact across the country.”

As they marched, protesters shouted slogans including “What do we do when diversity is under attack?” and “Stand up, fight back.”

Oct. 14, 11:35 a.m., Harvard Square: 
Co-founders of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard Jeannie Park ’83 and Michael Williams ’81 said their group sponsored the rally in Harvard Square to raise awareness and to drum up support for Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies.
“We wanted people to see that there was a real show of strength among not only the students, the alumni, but also the local community,” Park said. “I mean there are a lot of people here who have nothing to do with Harvard but understand that this isn’t about defending Harvard. It’s about defending principles, practices, and policies that we care about.”
“We want to make sure that people, including students and alums of Harvard are focused on this issue, and come out and stand in support of the position to support diversity, and support equity, and support higher education in general,” Williams said.

Oct. 14, 11:34 a.m., Harvard Square:
Harvard graduate Lushi Li '10 was visiting her parents in Boston when she found out about the #DefendDiversity rally in Harvard Square. Li said she immediately knew she had to attend.
"[Harvard] can be a great opportunity for a lot of students, and I think having a diverse student body is really important for the student experience itself for the opportunity it offers to underrepresented and underprivileged students," Li said. "It is important to be here today."
Another graduate — Carolyn W. Chou ’13, who spoke at a pro-affirmative action panel discussion held on campus last week — said she also showed up to prove her support for the College's race-conscious admissions policies.
“Both as an alum and as someone who works in Asian American communities locally in Boston, I think this really matters,” she said. “It’s not just about Harvard. It matters in the broader racial justice movement.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A $100 million dollar donation from an anonymous College alumnus and his wife will support the sciences at Harvard, the University announced Friday.
According to the press release, the donation — the largest to date during University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s tenure — will primarily support renovations and improvements to the Science Center’s labs, technologies, and classrooms. It will also fund two mathematics programs, including an academic exchange with universities in Israel and a postdoctoral fellowship in mathematical finance. The remainder of the donation will finance Faculty of Arts and Sciences initiatives.
Friday’s gift marks the first nine-figure donation made to Harvard since the record-breaking capital campaign concluded in June, raising $9.6 billion in total and shatting higher education fundraising records.
In the press release, Bacow wrote the gift will “provide powerful momentum” for Harvard’s science initiatives.
“This is a critical investment in ideas that will create exponential value not only for Harvard students and faculty, but also for society as a whole,” he wrote.
The donation comes as FAS continues to face the challenges of an increasingly tight budget, caused in part by multiple years of feeble endowment returns. Budgetary concerns have forced FAS to struggle with priorities such as faculty hiring and undergraduate House renewal.
Dean of FAS Claudine Gay wrote in the press release that the donation will impact “the lives and scholarship of students and faculty for many years to come.”
“Having a significant fund of flexible resources gives us critical capacity to sustain our core mission, embrace new innovation, and prepare our students for lives of leadership and service to the world,” Gay wrote.
According to the press release, the alumnus, who graduated in the 1990s, made the donation in honor of his father, Bacow’s new presidency, and the leadership of former FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
“I have truly admired Mike’s thoughtful leadership, and I have great confidence in Larry’s vision. But I especially want to show the love, respect, and admiration I have for my dad, who sacrificed so much to make my education possible,” the alumnus wrote.

A high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard’s admissions policies is headed to the courtroom Monday, meaning the University will spend the next few weeks duking it out with anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. SFFA filed a lawsuit in 2014 charging that Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants to the College, a claim Harvard has unequivocally denied.
Meet the lawyers who will defend the University in court: Felicia H. Ellsworth, William F. Lee ’72, Seth P. Waxman '73, Danielle Y. Conley, and Ara B. Gershengorn ’93.
William F. Lee ’72 is not only the lead trial lawyer representing Harvard in the lawsuit: He is also the first Asian-American to lead one of the nation’s foremost law firms and to gain a seat on the Harvard Corporation, where he now serves as the senior fellow.
Lee worked as the Managing Partner of Hale & Dorr for four years and continued in that role after the firm merged to become WilmerHale in 2004. He has litigated over 200 cases involving intellectual property, including representing Apple in their lawsuit against Samsung over patent rights to the smartphone, a years-long battle that culminated in Samsung paying Apple for patent infringement.
Lee has also served as lead trial counsel for several other technology-related cases at the federal level and argued before the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. He contributed to investigating the Iran-Contra affair as associate counsel.
In April of this year, Lee wrote a public letter criticizing the United States Justice Department’s demand that Harvard unseal admissions data and applicant information that was previously confidential. In his letter, he questioned why the Department intervened in the lawsuit and waited until April to request that the data become public.
“The Department’s belated interest in this case, and its submission on this confidentiality issue in particular, cannot help but give pause,” Lee wrote in his letter to the federal judge presiding over the case.
After graduating from Harvard magna cum laude in 1972, Lee continued his studies at Cornell, where he received both an MBA and a law degree in 1976. His classmates from Cornell Law School praised his academic success as well as his friendly personality.
“As one of three Asians in the class, we knew each other very well,” said Paul W. Lee, also a member of the graduating class of 1976 at Cornell Law. “He is one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet. Everywhere he goes he makes friends… He was incredibly bright and a terrific law student.”
“He’s one of the top trial lawyers in the country, not just one of the top Asian trial lawyers,” Paul Lee added.
Bill Lee served on Harvard’s Board of Overseers starting in 2002, prior to becoming the Corporation’s senior fellow. Last year, Lee chaired Harvard’s presidential search committee in the wake of former University President Drew G. Faust’s decision to step down.

Felicia H. Ellsworth both ran a marathon and had a child while clerking for Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, a “very impressive” feat according to fellow Roberts clerk Paul J. Nathanson.
Nathanson said Ellsworth brings extensive experience as a trial and appellate litigator, as well as a “brilliant legal mind,” to Harvard’s legal team.
Currently, Ellsworth serves as a partner in WilmerHale’s Boston office with Lee.
She began her law career — after graduating with high honors from the University of Chicago Law School — with clerkships under Roberts and Judge Michael Boudin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.
Ellsworth joined Wilmerhale in 2008. Early in her career, she worked with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to argue against the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act. She was promoted to partner in 2014.
Since then, she has been regularly ranked as one of the top attorneys in Massachusetts. She was named to the 2017 “Top Women of Law” list of the Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and a “2016 Trial Rising Star” by Law360.
Ellsworth, like many of the lawyers for both Harvard and SFFA, has a good deal of experience litigating before the Supreme Court. In 2014, she represented the beverage brand POM Wonderful in a suit against Coca-Cola before the Court. And in 2015, she co-authored an amicus brief with a team of WilmerHale lawyers on behalf of 303 conservative activists and politicians in Obergefell v. Hodges, arguing that the government should legalize same-sex marriage.
“By and large, people on both sides are big minds, constitutional lawyers,” Nathanson said. “It's not the normal trial lawyers you would find in litigation.”
"This is a small, small close-knit group of people who clerked together and are very well-equipped to litigate these types of complicated constitutional issues,” he added.

A seasoned appellate lawyer, former Solicitor General, and former member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, Seth P. Waxman ’73 will bring with him a host of experience when he steps into the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse Monday.
Waxman is currently a partner in WilmerHale’s Washington, D.C. office. He has a long record as a litigator before the U.S. Supreme Court, having delivered more than 65 oral arguments before the Court.
Waxman’s colleagues say he brings a sharp mind to the courtroom. In a 2012 interview about his legal strategy, he said his success rests on his ability to explain his case in terms simple enough for his young children to understand.
Former Solicitor General Paul D. Clement wrote in an email that, while he has argued both with and against Waxman before the Supreme Court, he “much prefer[s] the former.”
“Harvard has hired one heck of a great lawyer in Seth,” Clement wrote. “He will know his case and the case law inside out.”
Walter E. Dellinger III — who directly preceded Waxman as Solicitor General — wrote in an email that Waxman is uniquely positioned to argue the admissions case, combining “a commanding presence at the podium” with “a real understanding of how universities work.”
Perhaps most directly relevant to the suit brought by Students for Fair Admissions is Waxman’s involvement with another case related to universities’ admissions practices: Fisher v. University of Texas. In the 2016 case, plaintiff Abigail Fisher alleged the University of Texas’s admissions practices violated the Equal Protection Clause. Like SFFA, Fisher was supported by litigant Edward Blum.
Waxman was the lead counsel of an amicus curiae brief filed with the Supreme Court on behalf of Harvard and 13 other universities disputing Fisher’s claim.
“When a university considers which applicants will best contribute to a vibrant learning environment intended to prepare citizens and leaders for a heterogeneous society in which race remains a salient social factor, the university need not ignore the communities from which its students come,” he wrote in the brief.
Walter F. Pratt, Jr., a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law who edited the Yale Law Journal alongside Waxman, said Waxman knows the Supreme Court “impeccably well.”
“Seth is easy to work with and conscientious, a good friend and superb lawyer. [This is] the sort of case that is almost certainly going to the Supreme Court and Seth’s record as Solicitor General puts him in an elite group of people,” Pratt said.

Hailed as one of the D.C.’s 2017 “40 Under 40” by the Washingtonian, Danielle Y. Conley has extensive legal experience — both at WilmerHale and in the Department of Justice.
And she’ll probably need it. Conley is one of five lead lawyers who will represent Harvard in the admissions trial.
Though already a partner at WilmerHale, Conley left the firm for two years — from 2015 to 2017 — to work in the Justice Department under the Obama administration. During that time, she advised Deputy Attorney General Sally Q. Yates as an associate deputy attorney general.
She is currently a partner and co-chair of anti-discrimination practice at WilmerHale.
Robert T. Novick, co-managing partner at WilmerHale, praised Conley’s “excellent judgment and deep experience in complex government litigation and enforcement matters” in a press release announcing her return to the firm in 2017.
Much of Conley’s past litigation has focused on government litigation and statutory and constitutional issues. Conley also served as one of the lead trial lawyers in the case known as Veasey v. Perry, in which her team successfully challenged the constitutionality of a Texas photo ID law.
One of Conley’s self-described mentors is John A. Payton, who served as lead counsel for the University of Michigan in Gratz v. Bollinger, a Supreme Court case concerning affirmative action in university admissions.
Conley attended the Howard University School of Law, where she served as a staff editor for the Howard Law Journal.
— Cindy H. Zhang
Former Crimson editor Ara B. Gershengorn ’93 brings an insider’s perspective to Harvard’s legal team — Gershengorn currently serves as an attorney in the University’s Office of the General Counsel.
Like the other lawyers arguing for Harvard in the high-stakes and high-profile trial, Gershengorn has followed a well-trodden and prestigious path within the legal profession. After graduating from Harvard College — where she covered sports for The Crimson — she attended Columbia Law School, worked for the Columbia Law Review, scored an appellate court clerkship, and joined the Department of Justice Honors Program.
A former partner at Boston-based law firm Foley Hoag, Gershengorn has years of experience with civil litigation. During her time as a partner at Foley Hoag, she wrote an amicus brief on behalf of several federal cabinet secretaries in the landmark Supreme Court case U.S. v. Windsor. The brief urged the Court to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act — a law barring same-sex couples from receiving certain federal benefits — which the court ultimately ruled unconstitutional.
Since 2016, Gershengorn has marshalled her skills in the courtroom to teach students at Harvard Law, where she serves as a lecturer. She is slated to teach a course titled “Advocacy: The Courtroom and Beyond” in 2019.
According to the General Counsel website, Gershengorn currently advises Harvard on investigations, litigation, and law enforcement related matters. Perhaps most significantly for this fall’s trial, the website also lists “race conscious admissions” among her areas of expertise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly three dozen undergraduate students travelled to Sanders Theatre anticipating a lecture from former President George W. Bush on “Consulting and Greed” on a chilly Saturday afternoon — only to be met with Harvard Alumni Association security guards, disappointment, and, for some, embarrassment.
Harvard undergraduates received an email advertising the event a week earlier on Sunday, Oct. 7. The sender — whose identity remains unknown — labeled itself "the Harvard College Consulting Group," a campus organization that helps prepare undergraduates for careers in consulting. (HCCG has denied sending the email and says they do not know who the prankster is.)
“Join HCCG and President Bush as we explore consulting’s ethical position in society and learn best practices from President Bush’s illustrious presidential terms and political career,” the email read.
“I thought it was a really cool opportunity,” Alexander Koller ’22 said. “My friends applied to do this. A lot of people got rejected, so it seemed legitimate.”
After signing up, accepted students received a follow-up email informing them they were fortunate enough to be one of 900 students selected to attend the event — beating out others scores of others in a total applicant pool of 2,000. Email recipients were instructed to report to Sanders Theatre early and to prepare for “security lines” and “media presence.”
When students arrived, Bush wasn't there. Instead, they found members of Harvard's security corps, who informed them the Theatre was booked for a private Harvard Alumni Association event.
“A Securitas Guard with a bright yellow jacket told us, ‘Sorry folks! It’s a hoax. You can’t go in,’” Hannah A.J. Eckstein ’21 said.
Shortly after the fake event was slated to begin, students received a final email from the pranksters.
“Look, we get it. You’re upset. The event was fake, and we wasted your time. But how do you know consulting isn’t a bigger waste of time?” they wrote. “Sign out of LinkedIn. There’s so much more waiting for you.”
In an emailed statement, Anton Ulyanov ’19, the president of HCCG, denied any affiliation with the event and said he was frustrated that it caused “confusion.”
“HCCG is disappointed that an unknown party attempted to impersonate the organization and misuse its name,” Ulyanov wrote. “We understand that consulting isn’t for everyone.”
Students offered mixed reactions to the prank but none denied its success. Some praised the tricksters' ingenuity; others laughed in self-deprecation.
“I did not have any suspicions that it might not be real,” Michael C. Huang ’20 said. “Honestly, this is kind of cool. I have a certain respect for somebody who can pull off a stunt of this caliber. I’m kind of okay that I got punked.”
Duha H. Alfatlawi ’21 was less pleased.
“It’s embarrassing. We’re fools,” she said.
Other students wondered who might be behind the prank and sought to guess at the fibber's motives.
“Not many people came,” Alfatlawi observed. “Even I was thinking, ‘Are you sure it’s today?’ when we were getting off of the bus.”
Students speculated that the Harvard Lampoon or Satire V, two campus humor outlets, may be responsible.
The Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, did not respond to a request for comment.
Editor-in-Chief of Satire V Catherine Y. Zhang ’19 wrote in an emailed response: “lol.”
A spokesperson from the Office of George W. Bush did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted to release a statement broadly defending Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies at its Sunday meeting — but called for more transparency in admissions decisions and for the College to take a more holistic view of Asian-American applicants.
The vote came the day before the University faces off in court against advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in a case that could decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. SFFA, which is led by conservative activist Edward Blum, filed suit against Harvard in 2014, alleging that the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Harvard has repeatedly denied all allegations of discrimination.
The UC’s statement, drafted in part by its black and Asian-American caucuses, acknowledges students’ “various views” on the lawsuit, but argues that the Council’s core values as outlined in its Constitution — democracy, inclusion, education, equity, and service — necessitate a public affirmation of support for affirmative action.
“Banning the consideration of race from the admissions process is to attack what is central to Harvard’s mission, and to thereby prevent Harvard from pursuing the diversity necessary to ensure educational equity and fulfillment,” the statement reads. “At the core of a liberal arts education is diversity: in thought, in background, and in race.”
“We also recognize that race continues to be a defining factor of social and personal experiences in the U.S., and therefore cannot and should not be erased from consideration in admissions practices,” it adds.
Education Committee Chair Sruthi Palaniappan ’20, who helped form the Asian-American caucus last year, said she firmly supports race-based affirmative action, but called on the Admissions Office to employ a more holistic assessment of Asian-American applicants.
In documents released in June, SFFA presented an analysis of Harvard’s admissions data that showed that College admissions officers consistently scored Asian-American applicants lower than applicants of other races on “personal traits” like “kindness,” “positive personality,” “likability,” and “humor.” Lawyers for the University rejected this interpretation.
“There is a lot of diversity within the Asian-American community,” Palaniappan said.
To that end, the statement calls for changes to the College’s admissions process, specifically bias training for admissions officers and more transparency in how the College evaluates applicants.
“We push the Admissions Office to increase transparency within current admissions procedures, hire more diverse admissions counselors, hold their staff accountable for any potential biases, include diversity training regarding the Asian American community, and increase data disaggregation for sub-racial groups in recognition that our community is not a monolith,” the statement reads.
A College spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday evening.
Sunday’s vote was far from unanimous, with eight members voting against releasing the statement. The identities of those eight representatives are not public, as the Council uses an anonymous voting system for most pieces of legislation.
Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 argued that by considering race at all, the College is treating the Asian community as a bloc, as opposed to as individuals.
“How does the College knowing and taking into account purely whether you are Asian or not help contribute to a more diverse Asian community?” he asked. “How is that not treating Asians as a monolithic body?”
Multiple UC members also held out the possibility that the Council — or an individual caucus — would file an amicus brief in court to support the University’s admissions practices, either on its own or as a signatory to one that dozens of Harvard student groups submitted in late August.
Also at the meeting, finance committee members announced they would have to make a 27 percent across-the-board cut to this week’s grants, a sharp uptick from the 8 percent cut the committee imposed last week, which was the lowest cut since Fall 2016.
The high cut to grants comes just weeks after the UC passed an annual budget that included a $50,000 increase in funding for the finance committee — from $295,000 last year to $345,000 — that UC leaders hoped would prevent a similar budget shortfall as the one that the finance committee saw last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Remembering the senior’s kindness, compassion, and humor, more than 75 students, faculty, and friends gathered in the Dunster House courtyard Friday afternoon for a memorial service honoring Courtney S. Blair ’19.
Blair, a Dunster House resident, died suddenly in July at her home in Georgia. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana described her as “a beloved member of the College community” in a July 6 email sent to undergraduates.
At the memorial, students took turns sharing memories of Blair, ranging from late nights spent with her in the Dunster dining hall to chance encounters with her on the street that turned into close friendships. Their stories revealed the lasting impact that Blair had on everyone she knew.
Above all, speakers remembered her kindness. Multiple people recalled her bright smile, and infectious laugh. They said Blair always knew what to say to cheer them up when they were having a tough day, and could transition seamlessly from a serious philosophical discussion to cracking a hilarious joke.
In a written statement, Honey A. Holman ’19, one of Blair’s blockmates, said she is “grateful to have had the opportunity to remember and celebrate Courtney in Dunster House, where we built our friendship.”
Blair’s parents also attended the service and her mother, Fiona Anderson-Blair ’88, spoke about Courtney. She shared stories about Courtney’s empathy and humor, and urged attendees to feel grateful that they got to know Courtney rather than dwelling on their sadness about her death.
Her freshman proctor Dean Lee recalled that she always found a way to bring the entryway together during her first year at Harvard — even when she mimicked his gestures and got her friends to do the same. He recalled that, after a few minutes of her impression, the whole entryway was in hysterics, and he couldn’t help but laugh, too.
Midway through the service, some of Blair’s friends performed an emotional rendition of the Fleetwood Mac song “Landslide.”
Inside a common room at Dunster, more than 50 pictures of Blair lined the walls. A slideshow of photographs of her played on repeat. Guests circulated around the room before and after the speeches, exchanging memories of Blair, and a guestbook for the event garnered more than 75 signatures.
An Economics concentrator, Blair worked at the Harvard Shop, was a member of the Spee Club, joined the boxing club, and served as an economics and statistics tutor for College students. Over the summer, she interned for the Boston Consulting Group in Georgia.
Sean D. Kelly and Cheryl K. Chen, Dunster House faculty deans, organized the event along with some of Blair’s friends. In an email announcing the service, Kelly and Chen wrote the goal of the memorial was to help the House community feel “supported and sustained” in the aftermath of Blair’s death.
“Courtney was a good friend to many Dunsterites, and her loss is keenly felt,” they wrote. “This will not make the event any less of a tragedy; it is awful and will remain so. But it may allow us nevertheless to become stronger and closer than we otherwise would have been.”
This service was not the first memorial held for Blair at Harvard this fall; last month, students and friends gathered at the Spee to remember her and celebrate her life.
A light drizzle fell Friday morning, but about an hour before the service began, the sun began to shine and a light breeze blew through the courtyard. Blair’s mother said she could sense Courtney’s presence in the change of weather — Courtney’s optimism, her vitality, and her sunny personality.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High-profile leaders in the fields of public service, technology, and academia discussed corporate and public responsibility in an era of public-interest technology at an Institute of Politics event on Friday evening.
The four panelists, former Secretary of Defense and Kennedy School professor Ashton B. Carter, Government professor Latanya A. Sweeney, former head of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department Vanita Gupta, and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid G. Hoffman spoke before the packed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
They shared both personal experiences of being public interest technologists and their ideas on how to best address the regulation of technology firms during the hour-long conversation.
Sweeney, who also served as the Chief Technologist at the Federal Trade Commission, began by recounting her “simple experiment” on a health dataset that had led her to testify in front of Congress and “ended up having worldwide impact.”
“Technology is the new policy-maker,” Sweeney said later, referring to the life-changing but arbitrary decisions imposed by technology companies.
She said technology companies’ fiduciary responsibilities to their stockholders may supersede their responsibility to the public.
Hoffman remarked that there are a lot of other factors in tech companies’ decisions in addition to their responsibilities to shareholders.
“The idea that the shareholder value is the only purpose of a corporation would be completely lost on corporate culture not only thirty years ago, but four hundred years ago,” Carter, the Director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, said, “It’s cracking.”
Sweeney responded that a company's stated social consciousness is not enough, pointing out the power of arbitrary decisions made by companies such as Google.
“It is in fact a technocracy,” Sweeney said to applause from the audience.
The panelists discussed potential reforms needed to address issues with technology by government, civil rights organizations, nonprofits, and tech companies themselves.
Following the event, audience reactions were largely positive.
“I thought it was really great. I thought it was too short, honestly. I wish it was two hours instead of one,” Aaron T. Altabet, a student at the Graduate School of Education, said.
Lucas Lagos, a technical fellow at InternetLab in Brazil and researcher at the University of São Paulo, appreciated the opportunity to personally witness such prominent panelists discuss the issue.
“They’re kind of role models for us. So to hear them, to be near them, it’s a great opportunity for us to get a little bit more energy like they’ve said to fight this fight that’s terribly hard,” he said.
Speaking after the event, Gupta emphasized the challenge of addressing public interest technology in the future.
“This isn’t an academic set of questions,” she said. “These questions are having real-life impact on people and on communities, and I think it’s incumbent on us to increase the level of conversation and dialogue about these, about the intersection of technology and the public interest.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Institute of Politics hosted young politicians serving across the country Friday to encourage millennial involvement in politics.
The panel, entitled “Millennials and the Future of American Politics,” featured five state and local public officials who discussed their experiences and difficulties navigating politics at a young age. They also emphasized the potential millennials have as political outsiders.
Elected at age 28, Michelle Wu ’07, the president of the Boston City Council, acknowledged that many voters are hesitant to support young candidates.
“When you’re young, you could be too ambitious, or rash, or not ready,” Wu said. Of all the barriers to her candidacy — including her gender, race and age — she said youth was “the most salient.”
Yet, Eric P. Lesser ’07, a Massachusetts state senator first elected at 29, pointed to what he called “the single most powerful argument in politics right now” as a unique advantage for millenials with political aspirations: “that it is time for a change.”
“As a young person right now, you are perfectly poised to make that argument that you are not part of that entrenched structure that got us in the mess we’re in,” he explained.
Lesser and Wu were joined by Lange P. Luntao ’12, the youngest board member of the Stockton Unified School District; Svante L. Myrick, the mayor of Ithaca, N.Y., elected at age 24, after serving on city council since he was a junior at Cornell; Ryan F. Quarles, the Kentucky agriculture commissioner, elected at age 34 and the youngest elected statewide official in the nation.
Eloise T. Kaehny ’19, the chair of the IOP National Campaign, talked about her recent initiative working with students nationwide to increase voter participation at universities.
“Students are starting to care about issues and are moving away from party titles,” Kaehny agreed. “[We] are realizing how much potential we have as a bloc and are ready to step up.”
The panelists also focused on state-level politics and urged budding politicians to pursue opportunities in local politics.
“I get to work everyday for people who feel, and frankly, are invisible to decision makers,” Lesser said. “That’s a feeling you’d never get working in national politics.”
Students left the event saying they felt inspired. “The humor, the people, just the optimism — it was really great,” Evelyn R. Cai ’22 said. “Millennials right now are organizing around issues, as [the panelists] said, so they have to be optimistic about the outcome of their efforts.”
“It’s really great to see how low the barrier is for young people to make an impact on the front, in jumping in leading the organizations instead of just working quietly in the background,” Chris T. Cantwell ’22 said.
As for entering politics himself, Cantwell added, “it’s something I saw that maybe I’d do years down the line, but maybe I don’t have to wait so long.”

Less than 24 hours before a high-stakes and high-profile lawsuit challenging Harvard's admissions policies goes to trial, demonstrators took to the streets in Cambridge and Boston to hold two dueling rallies — one pro-Harvard and one pro-Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing the University.
Demonstrators began showing up to the Harvard rally — held close to campus in Harvard Square — around 11 a.m. Some sported beads, others “#notyourwedge” buttons adorned with images of cheese, and still others donned blue t-shirts decorated with University seals and the motto “Diversitas.”
The protest in the Square lasted for roughly two hours and saw speeches from students, alumni, and locals — all of them arguing in favor of the College’s race-conscious admissions policies. SFFA is suing Harvard over allegations that it discriminates against Asian-American applicants, a charge the University has repeatedly denied.
In Cambridge, it all started with music: 21 Colorful Crimson, a band made up of 21 Harvard students, sang “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” as onlookers and members of the press snapped photos. Participants — including students, faculty, alumni, and activists — swayed to the music and lofted signs reading “#DefendDiversity” and “Equality Opportunity Solidarity.”
Four miles away in Copley Square, it was a different — if parallel — universe.
Plastering themselves with heart-shaped SFFA stickers, participants in the Copley rally spent the afternoon loudly affirming their belief that Harvard’s admissions system is discriminatory. That demonstration, which kicked off at noon and stretched on for four-and-a-half hours, also saw speeches from Harvard students, alumni, and locals.
And there was music, too. At one point, a five-and-a-half-year-old girl mounted the stage to offer a quavering rendition of “Edelweiss,” drawing extended cheering from the crowd.
Just before 3 p.m., SFFA President Edward Blum took the stage, spurring applause and scattered cheers of “Thank you, Edward!”
“Let me be clear: The mission of Students for Fair Admissions is to end racial classifications and preferences in college admissions,” he said. “When you treat and judge individuals differently because of their race, it frays the social fabric of a college campus, which will ultimately fray the social fabric of a nation.”
Blum spearheaded SFFA’s suit against Harvard four years ago, though it wasn’t the first time he sought to radically alter the way American universities select students. Since 2008, Blum has litigated a series of cases meant to cancel the consideration of race in college admissions.
None of those were successful. But Blum is hopeful he’ll have better luck this time around.
The Harvard admissions trial — which launches in a Boston courthouse Monday — will likely last for three or four weeks. Either way Judge Allison D. Burroughs ultimately rules, the disappointed party will likely appeal the decision. Experts have said the case could well wind up before the Supreme Court.
If it reaches the Court, the decision probably won’t fall Harvard’s way, analysts say — particularly given the recent confirmation of conversative justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose appointment cemented the court’s shift to the right. A ruling in SFFA’s favor from the nation’s highest court could reshape the fate of affirmative action in the country.
Despite the high stakes, speakers and attendees at both rallies largely left the subject of the Court and the destiny of America’s race-conscious admissions policies untouched. Instead, demonstrators on both sides drew on their personal experiences to make their respective cases.
Protesters pointed to their upbringings and racial identities, their own paths through the college admissions process, and their families.
Copley Square protester Sunny Zhao, who is of Asian descent, said he was demonstrating on behalf of his children. He wants them to be able to go to Harvard one day.
“Look at my children,” Zhao said. “Look at the people here’s children. Our children study so hard. Their hard work is not as appreciated. Why? It’s just because we are Asian. That’s unfair.”
For fellow demonstrator Ally Wang, though, it isn't about sending her kids to the world’s top-ranked university.
Wang, who said she is married to a Harvard Medical School professor, said she traveled from New Haven, Conn. to attend Sunday’s demonstration. Wang said she has two sons, one five-year-old and one 10-year-old.
“I don’t really care if my children go to Harvard or not — we probably even kind of have legacy because my husband works for Harvard — but the way Harvard is doing it really hurts,” Wang said.
Over in the Square, Sally Chen ’19 — who supports Harvard and will be testifying in court in coming weeks on behalf of the University — said she is hurting, too.
Chen said she feels “personally unsettled” by the way the media has portrayed Asian-Americans in the lead-up to the trial, calling the representation “one-sided.” She decided to testify in court because she wants to tell her story and offer a fuller picture of what an Asian-American Harvard student looks like.
Chen, who is Chinese-American, grew up in San Francisco as the daughter of “Chinese immigrants who are working class,” she said.
“My dad’s a cook and my mom took care of me and my three sisters — there are four of us total — and when I reviewed my admissions file, that was really picked up on by admissions officers, that I balanced humility and humor and that I understood the view of an outsider,” Chen said.
Still, some speakers Sunday eschewed family background for Harvard history. Protesters pointed to the University’s well-documented discrimination against Jewish students in the early 1900s — and to this past summer, when internal Harvard documents published as part of the suit revealed that College admissions officers appear to give Asian-American applicants lower scores for their personal traits.
Zoey Lee, a high school student in ninth grade who is of Asian descent, said she finds it appalling that Harvard would give applicants like her poorer marks for personality. She said she hopes she will benefit from “equal opportunities” when she applies to college.
“There are many young Asians who are gritty and determined,” Lee said, referencing the fact that the College scores applicants on traits including “humor” and “grit.” 
“There are many young Asian-Americans who have a great personality,” she added.
Blum said he thinks Harvard has “systematically discriminated” against Asian-Americans for years. He mentioned yet another summer revelation that stemmed from the suit: the fact that the University’s internal research arm conducted a private study in 2013 that concluded the College’s admissions practices produce “negative effects” for Asian Americans.
“Not only did our experts conclude that Harvard’s admissions practices harm Asian Americans, but so did Harvard’s own internal experts,” Blum said. “Rather than address the study’s results, Harvard’s leaders killed it and then buried it.”
The University never made the internal study public and did not appear to take any significant action based on its findings. In court and in interviews since the existence of the 2013 review became public knowledge, Harvard lawyers and administrators have insisted the study was incomplete, based on limited data, and not meant to definitively evaluate whether the College's admissions office discriminates.
In addition to critiquing the way things work now, some demonstrators offered novel solutions for the future.
Undergraduate Kelley A. Babphavong ’20 stepped behind the microphone in Copley Square to float possible alternatives to Harvard's race-conscious admissions system. She suggested the College pursue a race-blind admissions process that heavily weights applicants’ socioeconomic status.
“It is not mutually exclusive to advocate for diversity while also openly criticizing Harvard for discriminating against a specific racial group,” she said. “Being Asian at Harvard is not easy, and I hope that the eradication of Harvard’s current admissions policies will allow Asians to no longer be discriminated against.”
Shiva Ayyadurai took it several steps further.
Ayyadurai, who is currently campaigning against Elizabeth Warren for a seat in the U.S. Senate, sharply criticized the University in a speech in Copley Square that lasted several minutes. He called the school “the center of the military-industrial complex” and “a hedge fund.”
"If there's a swamp in Washington, I’d argue Harvard is the sewer that feeds that swamp," he said. “Perhaps we should make Harvard a community college.”
The rallies Sunday followed several weeks of student activism on campus, most of it held in support of Harvard’s admissions policies. In the past month or so, undergraduates have organized demonstrations, hosted panels, and even set up pro-affirmative action photoshoots.
Several Harvard affiliates have also intervened directly in the lawsuit. In late August, 25 student and alumni organizations filed an amicus brief arguing for the educational value of race-conscious admissions practices.
Eight students and alumni will be allowed to testify during the forthcoming trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two days before the start of a trial in a high-stakes and high-profile lawsuit alleging Harvard’s admissions practices are discriminatory, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 had some thoughts he wanted to share with the College’s alumni interviewers.
“In case you haven’t been closely following along, I want to take this opportunity to remind you of some key points of Harvard's narrative,” Fitzsimmons wrote in a Saturday morning email to alumni obtained by The Crimson. “Harvard does not discriminate against Asian Americans or any race or ethnic group and does not use quotas of any kind in the admissions process.”
Harvard is currently battling a four-year-old suit brought by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions that alleges exactly that. The University has repeatedly denied SFFA’s charges and has insisted it must consider race in order to fulfill its educational mission.
In total, Fitzsimmons offered the alumni — who volunteer to interview applicants each year as part of the College’s admissions system — six bullet points that may come in handy should they encounter extra-inquisitive high schoolers.
Harvard crafts “an extraordinary and diverse class” by “recruiting broadly” across the globe, Fitzsimmons reminded alumni. It “carefully reviews” each applicant’s materials. It pursues a “whole person evaluation” by searching for “excellences of all kinds” that go beyond mere grades and test scores. Its admissions process has been “cited as a model” by the United States Supreme Court.
And “Harvard believes that its students benefit from learning and living with peers from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives in order to prepare them as citizens and leaders for the complex world that awaits them,” Fitzsimmons wrote.
The dean’s email repeats rhetoric previously employed by Harvard lawyers in pre-trial filings. Beginning Monday, those arguments will face scrutiny from SFFA’s lawyers, United States District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, members of the press, and a nation eager for a behind-the-scenes look at how the world’s top-ranked university selects its students.
Harvard and SFFA will argue their respective cases in a Boston courthouse in a public trial expected to last for at least three weeks. If it reaches the Supreme Court, the case could reshape college admissions in the United States.
Whether or not the University’s line of reasoning will convince Burroughs remains to be seen — but it proved less than effective for at least a few alumni interviewers.
SFFA supporter Lee C. Cheng ’93, a lawyer for the Asian American Legal Foundation who said he has interviewed Harvard applicants for 25 years, sharply criticized the wording of Fitzsimmons’s email in an interview.
Cheng called the dean’s “choice of language is striking.”
“Wouldn’t you say ‘The truth’ or ‘This is the unassailable and only truth’ if you really believed it?” he said. “I think that Harvard’s public responses have been incredibly offensive and something that many Harvard administrators will come to regret because they’ve taken such a hard line.”
“Maybe not in the trial, maybe not in five years, maybe not in 10 years, but someday,” he added.
Cheng added he thinks the trial and Harvard’s alleged discrimination against Asian-Americans will “absolutely” come up in interviews with prospective members of the Class of 2023.
Former Crimson editor and prospective alumni interviewer Kevin A. Hazlett ’16 said that, while he supports affirmative action and Harvard’s commitment to diversity, he thinks the College’s admissions policy falls short in other ways.
“There have been very well-publicized lawsuits against affirmative action in recent years, and to see them succeed would be very troubling.” Hazlett said. “But, at the same that the College is championing its diversity and financial aid policies, it’s propping up a system of legacy admissions that serves to have the opposite effect on the institution.”
University representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
And, though Harvard is encouraging alumni to chat with high schoolers about the suit, there’s at least one group administrators would rather the alumni avoid.
“Any press inquiries you receive can continue to be referred to” Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, Fitzsimmons wrote. “As always, we are deeply grateful for all you do on behalf of Harvard.”

The wait is finally over.
After months of anticipation, lawyers for Harvard and anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions will face off before a federal judge at 10 a.m. Monday morning in a weeks-long, high-profile trial that could shape the fate of affirmative action in the United States.
The trial will investigate allegations that the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. SFFA charges that Harvard systematically rejects qualified Asian-American applicants in order to maintain illegal racial quotas in its classes.
Harvard has repeatedly denied SFFA’s allegations. Administrators as high up as University President Lawrence S. Bacow have strongly defended the school’s consideration of race in the admissions process as key to fulfilling its educational mission.
Over the past year, court filings have unearthed many previously unknown details about the College’s famously secretive admissions process. And the revelations are likely to keep coming — as the trial proceeds, lawyers will present evidence and witnesses will give testimony that could offer the public unprecedented insight into how the world’s top-ranked university selects its students.
The Crimson breaks down what you need to know before the trial officially kicks off Monday — and what you can expect to learn before it ends.
In a word: yes.
Documents that may become public include private messages sent between Harvard admissions officers and students’ individual application materials. Both types of filings will likely offer new insight into how the College judges whether high schoolers are Harvard material.
At least four students’ files are guaranteed to become public. Four current College students and alumni witnesses have agreed to submit unredacted portions of their admissions files in court. One of these students, Thang Q. Diep ’19, already submitted part of his admissions file in an effort to help Harvard fight charges of discrimination.
Three others — Sally Chen ’19, Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, and Sarah F. Cole ’16 — will do so in the coming weeks. Diep’s filing — peppered with comments and scores from admissions officers and alumni interviewers — revealed Harvard reviewers’ focus on the candidate’s personality, Vietnamese background, and immigrant status.
Yes and no.
The vast majority of information canvassed in court will likely become public. In a final pre-trial hearing on Oct. 3, U.S District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs — the judge presiding over the case — ruled that any documents that lawyers for Harvard or SFFA “rely on” in court must become part of the public record.
But she agreed to grant certain exceptions. For example, Burroughs indicated she is amenable to redacting sensitive information such as students’ names.
And, given the trial is open to the public, anything said in the courtroom is also public.
It’s not entirely clear — yet.
On Oct. 1, lawyers for both Harvard and SFFA each submitted exhibit lists identifying thousands of documents the lawyers may choose to bring as evidence in court.
But it’s hard to tell what each document contains just from its name. A typical — and tantalizing — sampling: “Applicant File from Stuyvesant High School.” “Legacy List.” “Fitzsimmons Email to McGrath re: stats.”
Broadly, the evidence seems to fall into the two categories listed above: communication between College admissions officers and applicant materials.
Several of Harvard’s current and former top administrators — including former University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith — are scheduled to testify in court in coming weeks.
Other University officials who will face cross-examination include Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, former Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, and several admissions officers and staff researchers.
Harvard and SFFA will also rely on the testimony of expert witnesses Peter S. Arcidiacono and David C. Card — economics professors employed by SFFA and the University, respectively. Arcidiacono and Card analyzed Harvard admissions data before the trial and reached opposite conclusions: the former found the College discriminates based on race in its admissions process, while the latter found it doesn't.
In addition to the four College students and alumni who are submitting their own application files in court, an additional four have offered to testify in support of Harvard and on behalf of affiliated organizations. These individuals include Catherine H. Ho ’21, Margaret M. Chin ’84, Cecilia A. J. Nuñez ’20, and Madison A. Trice ’21.
SFFA President Edward Blum will not testify.
Burroughs is overseeing the case. It will be heard without a jury, meaning she alone has final power to decide.
Experts have said that, whatever she rules, the disappointed party — whether Harvard or SFFA — is likely to appeal the decision. Legal analysts say a cascading series of appeals could well bring the case before the Supreme Court.
If it comes before the nation’s highest court, the ruling probably won’t go Harvard’s way. The current set of justices skews conservative and skeptical of race-conscious admissions policies — especially after the contentious and tortuous confirmation of conservative justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
If the Court favors SFFA, it could mean the end of affirmative action as we know it in the United States.
The trial — which is expected to last at least three weeks — will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. It will take place in Courtroom 17 at the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in Boston.
Lawyers for Harvard and SFFA will take turns presenting evidence and quizzing witnesses called by both sides. Participants will typically break for a long lunch in the middle of the day each day.
The spectacle is likely to draw serious crowds. Burroughs has already arranged an extra courtroom to accommodate anticipated overflow.
Harvard and SFFA have retained some of the nation’s top legal minds in anticipation of the battle ahead. William F. Lee ’72 — the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s top governing body — is Harvard’s lead trial lawyer.
Read full profiles of three of Harvard's trial lawyers here.
SFFA's trial lawyers — hailing from the firm Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar & Scott LLP — include Adam K. Mortara, J. Scott McBride, Krista J. Perry, John M. Hughes, Katherine L.I. Hacker, and Meg E. Fasulo.
The trial is set to end by mid-November, but it may take Burroughs several months to issue a final ruling. Experts have said a decision in the case will likely come in spring 2019.
Still, Harvard and SFFA’s desire to appeal — and the looming threat of the Supreme Court — all but guarantee the trial won’t really end anytime soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For yet another game last week, a team with its home turf in Boston scored a decisive victory over a squad from New York. Unlike the Red Sox, No. 11 Harvard field hockey delivered an undisputed sweep of the visitors to set a program-best nine game win streak, smothering Cornell with eight goals while allowing a stunning zero shots from the Big Red on Saturday to win, 8-0, at Berylson Field.
As would be familiar to any reader of The Odyssey, Ithacans have a tough time on the road. Cornell (3-9, 0-4 Ivy) holds a 1-6 record for away games, against its even record at Dodson Field. However, like that epic’s namesake who earned early victories over the Trojans before his trying trek, the Big Red put together an impressive start to its outing.
Cornell goalkeeper Maddie Henry kept the first 21 minutes of the game scoreless, despite 11 shots from the Crimson (12-1, 4-0). However, a virtual line change by the Big Red in the 22nd minute saw four new players enter and brought a bend, then a snap, to the solid Cornell back line.
The 12th shot of the match, an up-close jab by junior midfielder Grace Geiger, ricocheted off the left leg of Henry and was collected by sophomore midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen at the top of the arc. Huibregtsen drew back her stick and fired, burying the ball in the back of the net and handing Harvard a 1-0 edge in the 26th minute.
From there, it was the Crimson all the way.
“I think Cornell did a good job in defending [near] the goal cage,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “I think that once the first goal fell, especially after the second one, they have to then push out, which gave us a little more space, and then we were able to just keep going. The first one was a pretty important one for us.”
The rest of the half’s points came hard and fast. The initial score of an eventual hat trick by junior forward Maddie Earle came in the 29th minute and was followed closely by an unassisted bouncer from freshman forward Olivia Hoover in the 34th.
A minute later, a whistle signalled the end of the onslaught — and a 3-0 Harvard advantage going into the second half.
Although a 48 degree steady rain chilled the fans, the Crimson’s sticks remained hot after the break. A set of goals by junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen in the 44th minute and Earle in the 45th preceded a cluster by Huibregtsen and junior midfielder Casey Allen in the 57th and 59th.
“We keep telling each other, ‘Next five minutes, next five minutes,’ or, ‘Next two minutes,’ just to keep focusing on the process and not the result,” van Vlijmen said. “So I guess that’s how we really kept our momentum after every goal.”
The final snipe, in the 68th minute, completed Earle’s second hat trick of the season, earning her a league-leading 12 goals, and topping off a dominant 8-0 Harvard victory — a program-best ninth consecutive win.
This topped the Crimson’s eight-game win streak of 2016, a season that saw Harvard reach the NCAA playoffs before falling to Syracuse in the first round.
For van Vlijmen and senior midfielder Victoria Boylett, posting a win against the Big Red was far from their only pregame concern. The duo performed the national anthem before the game’s opening whistle.
“Yeah, we were both very worried about doing it justice and stuff, because I’m from England and [van Vlijmen] is from the Netherlands, so we wanted to make sure we were respecting it and all that,” Boylett said. “I think it went well. It was amazing to have our teammates over as we hit the sort of more difficult notes that are renowned for being troublesome.”
The team saw six of its starting 11 against Cornell hail from outside the United States.
“In terms of culture and stuff, we love how we’re all very different,” Boylett said. “I think we can all learn a lot from each other by being from different places and having different experiences, in field hockey and in life in general.”
Van Vlijmen echoed the sentiment.
“This anthem, this sport, this school connects all of us,” van Vlijmen said. “That’s, like, a beautiful thing to represent, to be represented by.”
A playoff berth for this already-historic team lies heavily on the outcome of Saturday’s de-facto Ivy League championship game at third-ranked Princeton (11-3, 4-0).
“It’s a huge game, and I think the team knows that,” van Herwaarden said. “The last couple years, the Harvard-Princeton game has been the game of the season, and it’s going to be the same this year. Right now, after today’s win, we’re going to take the day off tomorrow and then get ready for Princeton.”

NO. 10 HARVARD 13, NO. 20 WAGNER 12
For the second straight day, the Harvard men’s water polo team found itself locked in a tight battle against another ranked team late in the fourth quarter. This time, the No. 10 ranked Crimson emerged victorious, edging out No. 20 Wagner by the final score of 13-12 Sunday at Blodgett Pool to cap this weekend’s Harvard Invite.
Harvard (15-5, 5-1 NEWPC) trailed the Seahawks (10-8, 3-1 MAAC) for most of the afternoon, going into halftime down 8-6 and then remaining behind for most of the third quarter. But the Crimson knotted the score at 10 apiece with 1:08 to go in the third, and the two teams then traded two goals apiece to start the fourth.
With a shade under three minutes to go in the game, Harvard thought it had gone ahead on a well-worked team goal. The refs judged differently and disallowed the goal after a long review, ruling that the Crimson had committed a foul in the lead-up to the goal.
“After the goal was overturned,” freshman attacker Alex Tsotadze said, “we just came back and said we’re just going to get a stop and do whatever we can to make up for that goal that was taken away.”
Two minutes later, the crowd erupted as Harvard scored again on a solo shot by senior attacker Nick Bunn. This time, the goal was counted, and the Crimson took the lead with 35 seconds to go. Wagner furiously tried to send the contest to overtime, and the Seahawks’ coaching staff argued for a missed penalty call with 10 seconds left. But Harvard withstood the barrage and held on to win.
“In the end, we came out strong and we came out swinging,” freshman goalie Noah Hodge said. “We fought hard against a lot of adversity that we competed against in that game.”
NO. 15 BUCKNELL 17, NO. 10 HARVARD 16
The win over Wagner came a day after the Crimson had fallen to No. 15 Bucknell (16-3, 8-1 MAWPC). In that game as well, the teams traded blows throughout in a matchup that ended with a final score of 17-16. While both defenses left something to be desired on Saturday, the offenses put on a showcase, ensuring that the game remained both competitive and exciting throughout.
The Bison maintained a narrow lead for most of the game, but Harvard managed to tie it with three minutes left on a breakaway goal by junior attacker Charlie Owens. It wasn’t enough to take the game to overtime, though, as Bucknell responded quickly, scoring what proved to be the game-winning goal before the end of regulation.
The game-tying goal was one of six Owens scored in the loss, making it the second time this season that he’s put as many as six past the opposing goalie.
“Yesterday was a wakeup call for us. We came in unprepared and unfocused mentally,” Hodge said, “We were much more focused going into the Wagner game.”
NO. 10 HARVARD 12, CLAREMONT-MUDD-SCRIPPS 8
The loss to Bucknell came after Harvard played a strong all-around game against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps (11-5, 6-0 SCIAC) to kick off the tournament. The Crimson jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead after goals by junior captain Austin Sechrest and Owens. Harvard entered the half up 7-3 after a strong defensive performance and kept the Stags at arm’s length throughout the second half, winning by a score of 12-8.
The Wagner match came after an exhibition game earlier Sunday morning in which the Crimson defeated the visiting University of Toronto, 19-11. The scrimmage was a chance for the Crimson to showcase its depth and experiment with some new lineups, as some backup players got extra playing time and made the most of it. The Varsity Blues had lost by more modest margins of six goals apiece to Harvard’s conference rivals Princeton and Brown earlier in the weekend.
After finishing the weekend 2-1, the Crimson will look to continue its winning ways next weekend in Santa Clara, Calif., where it will compete in the Julian Fraser Memorial Tournament. It will be Harvard’s second trip to the West Coast, after the Crimson went 3-1 in Davis, Calif., a month ago and notched its first ever win against a top-three opponent by beating No. 3 California 15-14 in an overtime affair.
“Just a lot more team defense, making sure other teams don’t score more than 10 goals on us,” Tsotadze said. “That’s one of our big goals this month.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting on a cold and rainy Saturday morning at Mignone Field, the Harvard rugby team handily defeated the Notre Dame College Falcons, 43-12.
“The weather was less than ideal today, so we adapted to that,” senior Caitlin Weigel said. “We were really focusing on controlling the ball and keeping possession and I think we did really well with that.”
After receiving the ball from Falcon’s kickoff, the Crimson (4-1, 3-1 Ivy) had a series of breakout runs, bringing them just short of the try line only four minutes in. Shortly afterwards, junior Delia Hellander scored and senior Jenny Kronish successfully converted, pushin Harvard out in front early, 7-0.
An offensive onslaught continued, with senior Rachael Harkavy evading the Falcons defense and bringing the Crimson up 12-0. Kronish followed up with a perfect kick, expanding the lead to 14-0.
Just seconds later, a steal by senior Akweley Okine led to a brilliant offensive flash, allowing Weigel to convert another try for the home team. Kronish once again followed up with a confident kick. Harvard built its lead to 21-0.
With the end of the half nearing, Notre Dame College (2-3) finally found some luck and broke through with a five point score. Regardless, the Crimson defense protected its turf, preventing any remaining attempts to end the frame. A large part of its competent defense was the success of its scrums.
“The girls set some goals before the game...they really wanted to maintain pressure and get their cadence going,” Harvard coach Mel Denham said, “Getting all eight working together on the scrum was something that really stood out.”
In the second half, Kronish and Weigel each scored within the first ten minutes, with Kronish going two for two on the conversion attempts and leading Harvard to 35-5. With 13 mins left, the Falcons found a break and ran away with a try, closing the gap between the squads to 35-12.
A penalty kick for the Crimson by Kronish brought the score to 38-12. Finally, a late score in the last minute by the New York native only served to expand the established Harvard lead to 43-12 and end the game.
“It was cold and there were a few handling errors, [but] there was just some really good team play,” Denham said.
The Crimson will next host Brown on Saturday, October 20, at Mignone Field.
“Next week is our last regular season game, so we’re looking to really use that game to polish up the finer points of our game and to get everyone firing on all cylinders at the same time with the same intensity,” Kronish said. “Come Ivy Championships and National playoffs, we are going to dominate and take it all the way.”

Whether it’s a cringeworthy hookup, an overly talkative classmate, or a nemesis who has sworn to destroy your life at all costs, we all have people we’d rather not run into. However, it can be difficult to keep your distance while living and learning at the same college. We’ve got a few ideas for those awkward acquaintances you’d prefer to avoid.
Take the scenic route
The classic method of avoidance is to take the road less traveled, aka rack up some steps on your Fitbit. If you know a person’s schedule well enough, you can keep your distance by completely circumventing their path. Become an anti-stalker!
Go incognito
A disguise can be a powerful weapon. Dye your hair. Grow a beard. Get a face tattoo. You’re approaching a quarter-life crisis anyway. Get a head start on the total physical transformation that’s sure to follow your existential despair.
Hire an entourage
If you’re too eye-catching to be inconspicuous, embrace your inner celebrity and buy your followers. Your real friends probably won’t want to surround you 24/7, so paid companionship is your best bet. If you want to take it a step further, purchase a limo and have a group of bodyguards run around the vehicle, à la Kim Jong Un.
Never leave your dorm
With the rise of companies like UberEats and Amazon, becoming a recluse has never been so easy. Hermetism can be an extremely successful way to avoid people…unless the person you’re trying to avoid is your roommate. In that case, you’re screwed.
Build a subterranean network of tunnels
Illegal? Possibly. Effective? Absolutely. Take your cues from Elon Musk on this one.

If you somehow managed to sleep through the Opening Days Job Activity Fair, or are simply in denial about the fact that your mom will no longer support your Boba addiction, here are several on-campus jobs that you can still apply for as a major procrastinator.
The Sit at a Desk and Pretend to Study Job
Coveted by students, these “I-get-paid-to-study” jobs are where it’s at. Hit up Common Spaces at the Smith Campus Center for a low-key desk job where you can make up to $15 an hour chatting with security guards and occasionally helping to carry a stack of chairs or two. Swiping IDs at the MAC or Hemingway is also a sure way to kill three birds with one stone: studying, making $$$, and you get to make eye contact with that cute athlete you’ve been admiring from afar. Win-win-win.
The Hot Bartender Job
Have you always wanted to go home each night smelling like beer or burnt coffee grounds? Were you dazzled by College Humor’s “Baristas are the Ultimate Male Fantasy” video? Consider becoming a barista or bartender! If working at LamCaf or Barker is too *cliche*, try hitting up Pavement Coffeehouse or Blackbird Donuts in the Smith Center for a more low-key job. Check out the Cambridge Queen’s Head if you’re looking to join a cool group of students who basically get paid to socialize and eat wings on Friday nights. Hint: you make tips.
The Stacks Job
Perhaps the most isolated of the bunch, this is for all you Lamonsters who basically live at the library. Why not get paid for it? Shelving books may be tedious, but it gives you the chance to belt out High School Musical lyrics where no one has to suffer from your perfect pitch, or listen to that one podcast everyone hates but you secretly like. Walking around the stacks also helps you get in your steps for the day (and keeps your mom off your back). And hey, you might even be able to knock out that infamous item on the good ‘ol Harvard Bucket List and get paid to do it.
If you’re worried you’re becoming too much like the checking-your-bank-account meme, consider picking up one of these on-campus jobs. Or just tell yourself you will. I mean, once a procrastinator always a procrastinator, right?
