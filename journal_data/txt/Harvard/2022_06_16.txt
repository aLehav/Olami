After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Slotted to play three festivals across three states in just three days, it was bound to be a hectic weekend for up-and-coming pop star Charlotte Sands. Add in extreme weather, a canceled flight, and a fourteen hour drive from Kentucky to Boston and one could fairly say that the odds were stacked against the Massachusetts native. Unfazed by any of these roadblocks, though, Sands opened up day two of Boston Calling with an electrifying set, showing off her stellar vocals and snappy songwriting.
Sands was propelled from tepid newcomer to rising star with the release of “Dress” in 2020. Written in response to the controversy spawned by Candace Owens when Harry Styles wore a dress on the cover of Vogue. The track went viral after Sands posted a TikTok teasing the song. The post went on to receive over 1.3 million views and counting. In the year and half since the release, Sands went on to release two EP’s, growing her collection of energetic pop-punk bangers.
As the festival gates to Boston Calling opened and the first raindrops began to fall, an anxious chatter fell over the growing crowd in anticipation of Sands’ performance. The restless cacophony fell into attentive silence as Sands’ crystal clear vocals rang out across the audience with the opening lyrics from her song “Love and Other Lies.” Sands sung from offstage, and the audience watched as the onstage screen switched from the Boston Calling logo to Charlotte Sands’ logo, shining in neon blue to match the artist's signature hair color.
After a heart pumping drum solo, Sands made her grand entrance performing a high energy rendition of the unreleased track “Tantrum.” With a stack of wristbands, including her “artist” wristband from her earlier performance at Forecastle Festival still tied around her wrist, Sands showed no signs of fatigue jumping across the stage and calling out to attendees.
As a hometown show, the performance had a special intimacy and vulnerability to it; Sands’s parents and siblings were in attendance. This resulted in a heartwarming moment during the performance of “Lost,” a song that is Sands's take on the standard teen-angst pop-punk song. Sands followed up the lyrics, “I got mad at my parents / So I dyed all my hair and/ Now we all go to therapy... I'm still pissed at my parents” by exclaiming “Sorry Mom!” prompting an outburst of laughter from attendees.
When Sands wasn’t channeling the rock star imagery of Avril Lavigne or Haley Williams, she took a moment to slow things down. On “Keep Me Up All Night” Sands delivered an emotionally raw performance. The singer perfectly blended a mix of emotionally charged strained vocals while still impressively belting out the heartbreak ballad.
As her set continued, audience engagement only intensified in a testament to Sands’s impressive songwriting and vibrant onstage presence. Aside from a few hardcore fans who came equipped with signs and memorized lyrics, many in the audience were new to Sands’ music. However, the artist proved her musical prowess to new and old fans alike as she won the crowd over. As the performance went on, the crowd grew from tentatively whispering the call and response lyrics to “Special” to emphatically shouting and fist pumping out the “hey, hey, hey” of “Lost.” By the set’s midpoint, it was clear that the attendees had bought into Sands’s rebellious pop-punk aesthetic.
“This song is about wearing whatever the fuck you want” said Charlotte Sands before closing out the show with her hit song “Dress.” It was a warm finale to a set that showed off Sands’ skills as both a songwriter and a vocalist.
It seemed that Sands’ Boston Calling performance was destined to work out regardless of the roadblocks she faced on the way there. Just minutes after her set concluded and the crowd dispersed, a severe weather warning led to the evacuation of the Harvard Athletic Complex along with a three hour delay. Luckily, Charlotte Sands gave a performance that made it well worth the hassle of waiting out the post-show rain delay; a wait that fittingly gave attendees a much needed opportunity to add a few new Charlotte Sands tracks to their playlists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled that a lower court improperly dismissed one count of a 2019 lawsuit filed by a former Harvard undergraduate who alleges he was wrongfully denied his degree after being accused of sexual assault.
The plaintiff in the suit, Damilare Sonoiki, sued Harvard October 2019, alleging the school wrongfully withheld his degree after the Administrative Board issued three charges of sexual misconduct against him, required him to withdraw from the College, and recommended his dismissal to the Faculty Council in November 2013.
Sonoiki’s suit was dismissed by a federal judge in 2020. But on Tuesday, a panel of three First Circuit Court of Appeals judges reversed the dismissal of the suit’s first count — which claims Harvard breached the contract that governs student-University relationships — while upholding the lower court’s dismissal of the three other counts. The case will be sent back to lower court for further proceedings.
The panel ruled that the first count of Sonoiki’s suit should have survived Harvard’s motion to dismiss because he plausibly alleged that Harvard breached its contract with him. The judges did not rule on the merits of his claims.
In his suit, Sonoiki alleged that the Ad Board failed to inform him that communications he had with his board representative, then-Currier House Resident Dean Laura K. Johnson, would not be kept confidential.
The Ad Board is a Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee that enforces undergraduate academic and social conduct policies. The board no longer investigates sexual misconduct allegations, though it still has jurisdiction over disciplinary action. The Office of Dispute Resolution, founded in 2014, is now charged with the fact-finding process for sexual harassment complaints. Every student has an Ad Board representative — typically the resident dean in their assigned undergraduate house — who is charged with serving as a liaison between them and the Ad Board.
While the Ad Board procedures did contain one provision indicating that board representatives do not advocate for the students they represent, it also contained numerous statements that encouraged students to be “open and honest” with their Rep, creating “ambiguous” language, Judge O. Rogeriee Thompson wrote in the ruling.
“The contractual terms as described above clearly and strongly encouraged Sonoiki to trust his Board Rep and therefore Sonoiki could reasonably expect that some level of confidentiality flowed from such a trust relationship,” Thompson wrote.
Sonoiki’s allegations state a “plausible breach of contract claim” on the basis that he “reasonably expected his Board Rep to respect some confidences,” Thompson wrote.
Sonoiki’s attorneys, Susan C. Stone and Kristina W. Supler, said they were “pleased” with the court’s decision to reverse the dismissal of the first count and look forward to further litigating the suit.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the ruling.
The judges affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the three remaining counts of Sonoiki’s suit, which alleged that Harvard denied him fairness in disciplinary proceedings, that the University breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and that he relied, to his detriment, on Harvard’s promise of fairness.
In his suit, Sonoiki alleged the Ad Board process was “riddled with implicit racial bias,” citing that none of its members were Black men and that the board did not require its members to undergo implicit bias training.
The board’s recommendation to dismiss Sonoiki occurred after he had already left the College and started working for the investment banking company Goldman Sachs. Sonoiki resigned in 2015 after the firm discovered he did not in fact possess a degree from Harvard.
In July 2021, Sonoiki was sentenced to a month in prison for an insider trading scheme in which he allegedly leaked information about pending mergers and acquisitions to former NFL linebacker Mychal Kendricks in exchange for kickbacks.
Both Sonoiki and Kendricks, who allegedly profited nearly $1.2 million through the leaked information, pleaded guilty in 2018.
Sonoiki, a former Crimson editor, previously wrote for the television shows “The Simpsons” and “Black-ish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A plurality of Harvard faculty are satisfied with outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s tenure in office so far, according to The Crimson’s annual survey of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences conducted in April.
Just under 41 percent of surveyed faculty members said they are somewhat or extremely satisfied with Bacow’s tenure — down seven points from last year. This year, nearly 40 percent of faculty respondents indicated they are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with his job performance, while just under 20 percent said they are somewhat or extremely dissatisfied.
Bacow announced last week — after the survey was conducted — that he plans to step down in June 2023.
Bacow’s rating was lower than that of FAS Dean Claudine Gay, whose satisfaction rating was 52 percent, according to the survey. Less than 20 percent of surveyed faculty said they were dissatisfied with Gay.
The Crimson distributed its survey to more than 1,100 members of the FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, polling tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty on their demographics, academic life, and viewpoints on other issues, including Harvard governance.
The 111-question survey garnered 476 responses, including 333 that were complete and 143 that were partially filled out. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from April 11 to April 26. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first, second, and third installments of The Crimson’s 2022 faculty survey explored faculty views on sexual harassment, Covid-19 response, and tenure, respectively. This fourth installment examines how faculty evaluate the tenures of Bacow, Gay, and Harvard’s standing within higher education.
Bacow has led the University through the Covid-19 pandemic and the political strife that defined former President Donald J. Trump’s final two years in office.
Roughly 31 percent of faculty respondents said they believe Bacow has represented their interests well, while roughly 40 percent said they neither disagree nor agree with the statement. Just over 28 percent of respondents strongly or somewhat disagreed that Bacow has represented their interests well.
Ladder faculty respondents were more likely to report satisfaction with Bacow’s job performance. Just over half of ladder respondents indicated they are satisfied with his tenure, compared to just under 30 percent of non-ladder respondents. A plurality of non-ladder respondents — 49 percent — reported feeling ambivalent about his performance.
Only 20 percent of non-ladder respondents said Bacow represents their interests well, compared to nearly 43 percent of ladder respondents. Additionally, 34 percent of non-ladder respondents said Bacow does not represent their interests well, compared to 21 percent of ladder respondents.
In response to an open-ended question asking what Bacow should focus on during the rest of his tenure, faculty offered a broad range of suggestions.
Many respondents highlighted job security as an important agenda item for Bacow. Some advocated for eliminating time-capped appointments or extending term limits for non-tenure-track faculty, as well as raising pay and improving employment security for staff, graduate students, and non-ladder faculty. More broadly, some respondents wrote they would like Bacow to promote campus diversity by hiring and granting tenure to faculty of color and supporting first-generation low-income individuals.
Numerous faculty urged Bacow to make climate change a priority for the University.
A few faculty members argued that Harvard lacks ideological diversity, calling on Bacow to encourage open debate and protect academic freedom. One respondent wrote that Bacow should restore “the reputation of universities as disinterested seekers of truth rather than left-wing indoctrination and propaganda outlets.”
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.
More than a quarter of faculty respondents said they are extremely satisfied with Gay’s job performance, and nearly 27 percent indicated they are somewhat satisfied. Around 13 percent of respondents said they are somewhat dissatisfied and 6 percent of respondents said they are extremely dissatisfied.
Ladder faculty were more likely to be satisfied with Gay’s tenure thus far than were non-ladder faculty. More than 66 percent of ladder faculty respondents reported satisfaction with Gay’s job performance, compared to just under 38 percent of non-ladder faculty respondents.
Forty-four percent of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that Gay has represented their interests well, while 31 percent were ambivalent, and 25 percent somewhat or strongly disagreed.
Ladder faculty were also more likely to believe their interests were well-represented by Gay. Among ladder faculty respondents, nearly 56 percent said Gay has represented their interests well; among non-ladder faculty respondents, less than 33 percent indicated the same.
Responding to an open-ended question asking what Gay should prioritize in the next years of her term, many wrote the FAS should provide better support and improve job security for non-tenure-track faculty — similar to the responses for Bacow. Others called for the FAS to prioritize faculty diversity.
The FAS holds monthly meetings during the school year where faculty discuss campus issues and vote on legislation. Nearly 64 percent of ladder faculty respondents said they have attended an FAS meeting in the past six months. But over 60 percent of ladder faculty respondents said they believe faculty meetings are not an effective forum for faculty to express their interests.
Asked to explain their reasoning, many faculty wrote that faculty meetings are often intimidating and largely scripted, limiting free and meaningful discussion. Some added that the discussions are often dominated by a small, non-representative sample of faculty members.
FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
A plurality of faculty respondents – nearly 48 percent — indicated they believe Harvard’s standing within higher education has stayed the same over the past decade. Just under 43 percent of faculty respondents believe the University’s standing within higher education has fallen.
Only 9 percent of respondents believe Harvard’s standing has risen.
Faculty were split on whether the school is the best educational institution in the U.S.: 38 percent of respondents said it is not, compared to 36 percent who said it is.
Furthermore, 32 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that Harvard is the best educational institution in the world, while 41 percent indicated they disagree.
Nearly 58 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed the humanities are in decline at Harvard.
For its 2022 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from April 11 to 26, 2022. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in March 2022 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty.
Of those faculty, 492 faculty members accessed the link, and 476 participants answered at least one question. A total of 333 participants fully completed the survey.
To check for potential response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, race and ethnicity, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, the respondents to the survey were in line with the demographics of the broader faculty.
Of survey respondents, 42 percent identified themselves as women, and 25 percent identified themselves as faculty of color. Based on data in the 2021 FAS Dean’s Annual Report, women and faculty of color make up 39 and 26 percent of FAS faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 42 percent of the FAS are senior non-ladder, non-ladder, or visiting faculty. Among the respondents to The Crimson’s faculty survey, 49 percent indicated that they are non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 140 — or 12 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.
