After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pay attention, hip-hop world. There's a young performer from Compton who is blowing up and is the most creative and talented rapper in years. He's currently on a college tour and generating widespread publicity wherever he goes.
 
Unfortunately, that's all the space I really have to talk about Kendrick Lamar. This review is dedicated to Tyga, who shares Lamar's youth, trade, and hometown, but basically nothing else. You've probably heard that Tyga is misogynistic. This is true. He is also vacuous, talentless, and devoid of personality. His latest album, "Hotel California," reflects how little he has to rap about, and how bad he is at doing it. 
 
Tyga claims that he is well-endowed throughout the album, but his scope is tiny. His whole credo can be summed up by the chorus of “Hijack”: “Money pussy weed got all that.” Each song is a barrage of clumsy bravado about what he drinks, smokes, earns, steals, defeats, and has sex with. His whole act is two-dimensional, and his choruses are probably a step below that: “Bitch I’m all you need”; “All my shit dope”; “Real shit I ain’t never been a liar.” Perhaps the worst of the bunch can be found on “Hit ‘Em Up,” a shameless appropriation of a 1999 C-Murder/Snoop Dogg song: “Fuck them other niggas cause I’m down for my niggas / Fuck them other niggas cause I’m down for my niggas.” It doesn’t help that the beat is significantly less funky than the original, or that Lamar recently quoted the hook ironically as part of a narrative condemning the “hood” lifestyle.
 
Tyga, on the other hand, seems to genuinely believe that he’s capturing Compton life in his lyrics—which is unfortunate, because his rhymes are about as lifeless as he claims his many enemies are. Sometimes, he doesn’t even try: “Ain’t no place I’d rather be / I’m right here with you in LA / Yeah it’s real shit.” He also rhymes “important” with “annoying.”
Other times, he shows that he has a vague conception of how to write a verse, but hasn’t quite put it together. He knows he's supposed to make references to the classic greats of the genre, but he doesn’t know how to make them smooth or clever: "Got shooters like the Heat / Real motherfuckin’ Gs / RIP Eazy E." His attempts at wordplay similarly founder—though he seemd aware of the basic concept, Tyga can’t break the surface level of meaning: "Bitch I'm the bomb, call me the unabomber." And he vaguely knows what a simile is: "Niggas wanna stop me like the Nazi." There aren’t too many lines on the album that don’t induce a cringe, or at least a grimace. 
 
Admittedly, there are many current rappers whose cringeworthy lyrics help fuel the opinion that hip-hop is in a deplorable state right now. What sets Tyga apart from even them is his utter lack of personality or joy. There is nothing original, charismatic, or alluring about Tyga’s act. He’s a cookie-cutter impersonation of the larger-than-life presences who came before him, and he even pales in comparison to the other bad rappers on this album, who at least bring some swag. While Tyga solemnly announces that he “got bitches like Hooters” on “Hijack,” 2 Chainz saves the song and practically the back end of the album with pure idiotic enthusiasm: “If you believe in having sex, say me too! / I'm riding in my roof look see-through / I got fours on the big like preschool.” There are few who would argue for 2 Chainz’s lyrical genius, but at the very least he brings diversity to the genre by way of energy and idiosyncrasy. There isn’t one defining trait of Tyga other than that he’s a thin representation of some sort of problematic and nonexistent hip-hop ideal.
Moreover, Tyga’s foremost idols and influences line up one by one on “Hotel California” to show us just what Tyga is missing. Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, and Jadakiss are all immediately recognizable from the first lines of their verses; they each bring their trademark cadences and wit to remind us why they are (or once were) important in hip-hop. In contrast, there is nothing important or unique about Tyga. This album is a collection of uninspired and unfounded bragging. Do yourself a favor and try Shea Rose instead.

Harvard Management Company’s Director of Private Equity Peter F. Dolan ’83 left HMC on Wednesday after nearly 20 years with the firm, according to a University official familiar with the matter.
John M. Shue ’91 will serve as interim head of HMC’s private equity and venture capital portfolio, according to the official, who declined to elaborate further because of a policy prohibiting public comment on personnel matters. Shue was previously a senior vice president in HMC’s private equity group and responsible for private equity in emerging markets.
Dolan’s departure comes as HMC, which manages Harvard’s $30 billion endowment, has made up around half of the $11 billion that the endowment lost during the recession. In the 2012 fiscal year, which ended last June 30, HMC’s private equity holdings gained 2 percent, according to the University’s annual financial report. For Dolan’s time at HMC, which began in 1995, that figure represented diminutive gains compared to a fiscal year 2012 benchmark of 4 percent and an average annual return on private equity of 20 percent over the last 20 years.
Private equity has played a significant role in Harvard’s endowment during Dolan’s tenure, representing its second-largest asset class at around $7 billion last fiscal year.
Since the recession and the arrival of HMC CEO and President Jane L. Mendillo in 2008, the firm sought to deal with the volatility of the financial crisis by unloading HMC’s particularly illiquid assets, including private equity, in favor of real assets such as natural resources.
Prior to joining HMC, Dolan worked for consulting firm Cambridge Associates and Liberty Mutual Insurance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomore midfielder Murphy Vandervelde raised his arms in the air as his teammates mobbed him, celebrating their first win over a ranked opponent this season. With a playoff berth on the line, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team turned to its newest sharpshooter when the game came down to the final shot. Vandervelde delivered.
Vandervelde’s third goal of the afternoon lifted  the Crimson to an 8-7 overtime win over No. 16/14 Penn at Harvard Stadium Saturday. With two games left in the regular season, the win puts Harvard (6-6, 2-2 Ivy) ahead of No. 16/14 Penn (6-4, 2-3), and into a tie for third in the Ivy League standings.
“It feels good to come out on the top of that one,” Vandervelde said. “We’ve had a couple of games where we’ve lost in the fourth quarter, and it feels good to finally put together a 62-and-a-half-minute effort there and finish the fourth quarter.”
A week after conceding five unanswered fourth-quarter goals in a 14-12 loss to No. 2 Cornell, Harvard narrowly avoided another late-game collapse. The Crimson dropped a three-goal lead in the fourth as a strike from Penn junior defender Alex Blonsky capped off a 4-1 Quaker run with 55 seconds left in the fourth to tie the game at seven.
In the final seconds of regulation, Harvard struggled to force overtime as Penn went on the man-up after a Crimson faceoff violation. Three dangerous Quaker shots sailed wide before time expired.
But Harvard controlled the extra frame from beginning to end. Senior midfielder Rick Molé won the opening faceoff for the Crimson, and Harvard drew a 30-second interference penalty less than two minutes later.
On the man-up, Harvard cycled the ball to Vandervelde, who was waiting in a familiar spot, high in the left wing of the box. With two seconds left on the advantage, the sophomore unleashed a long-range game-winner from the 20-yard line.
“We ran a play that we run a lot on man-up,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “We knew they were going to be packed in and that we would have opportunities to shoot the ball from the outside.”
Less than two weeks after capturing The Crimson’s Athlete of the Week honors, Vandervelde continued to roll. After scoring his first collegiate goal in a 9-6 win over Dartmouth Mar. 23, the midfielder has scored 12 goals in his last five games.
“It’s just my teammates getting me looks,” Vandervelde said of his recent scoring outburst. “I just have a lot of space, and it’s kind of just closing my eyes and shooting the ball and hoping the goalie doesn’t get it.”
Despite being out-performed on the stat sheet, the defense held strong and kept Harvard in the game. Senior goaltender Harry Krieger finished with a game-high 12 saves.
“When it counted, our defense really stepped up, shut them down, and gave the offense a chance to finish the game out,” Vandervelde said.
Crimson junior attackman Carl Zimmerman provided the game’s first goal less than a minute and a half into the first. Penn responded with three straight strikes to jump out to its largest lead of the game, 3-1.
But a late first-quarter goal from senior attackman Alex White sparked a 5-0 Crimson run that carried through the second and third quarters. White found the back of the net from the top of the box to record his team-leading 19th goal of the season.
Vandervelde scored his first goal of the game high on the right wing to even things up, 3-3, 46 seconds into the second. Three minutes later, Zimmerman danced around the crease and beat Penn junior goalkeeper Brian Feeney for the go-ahead goal. Murphy added his second goal of the game at the 8:32 mark of the second quarter on the man-up.
“I thought we started out really crisp on offense; [we were] really shooting the ball well,” Wojcik said.
A defensive chess match characterized the rest of the second quarter and most of the third, as 23 minutes and 18 seconds passed without a goal on either side.
Two Penn shots rang off the Harvard pipes in the second, but the Crimson managed to hold the Quakers scoreless. Harvard junior Jack Walker broke the scoring drought with 14 seconds left in the quarter off a feed from White.
Penn controlled the final frame of regulation, outshooting the Crimson, 17-2. After Penn scored three goals in less than six minutes to tie the game at six with just over four minutes remaining in regulation, the Crimson responded as Dwyer found Ian Ardrey in front of the goal for a 7-6 edge with just over two minutes left.
Harvard appeared to have the game locked up with a minute to play after defender Robert Duvnjak forced a Penn turnover. But Quaker freshman Matt Leonhard prevented the Crimson from completing the clear, knocking the ball out of the stick of junior midfielder Brian O’Toole to give Penn possesion. Seconds later, Blonsky evened the score at seven.
“In the fourth quarter, we were very sloppy,” Wojcik said. “For us though, to win and get over the hump—to finish a close game out—is a big step forward for this team.”
The Crimson now controls its destiny as it heads into its final two games of the regular season versus No. 10/9 Princeton and No. 17/15 Yale. Two wins would guarantee Harvard a top-four conference finish and an Ivy League tournament berth.
“That was like a playoff game for us,” Vandervelde said. “We’ve got two more games, and it’s win out or die. The playoffs have started, and we still have life.”

We love Finale as much as the next people, but constantly kicking it Square-side can get a little dull. In the spirit of changing things up, we decided to visit three sweet eateries that are ever so slightly off the beaten path. Each is within fifteen minutes of the Yard, and well worth the minor trek. Let your sweet tooth spread its proverbial wings!Toscanini's
 
Though we can't find documentary evidence of such an occurence, Toscanini's website proudly proclaims that the Central Square establishment has been hailed by the New York Times as having "the best ice cream in the world." After journeying to the storied storefront, we are inclined to agree. Once we explainined our mission to the employee "on line" (a taste of Toscanini vernacular), we were offered samples of some of Toscanini's most popular flavors.
 
First on the docket was B3 (brown sugar, brown butter, brownies). Sales of this flavor are exponential (get it?), and having experienced its milky decadence, we understand why. Next we tried burnt caramel. This is a more polarizing flavor on account of its bitterness. We were a perfect case-in-point. ("Meh," said Connie. "DELICIOUS," gushed Emma.) Third up to bat was khulfee, which our server offered us as an example of a flavor you won't get anywhere else, and as representative of the diversity of the Central Square community. Khulfee is an Indian flavor combination that joins cardamom, almonds, and pistachio nuts.
 
As we indulged in our samples, we chatted with our server, a Cambridge-raised three-year employee who cited "proximity to ice cream" and a community of regulars as her favorite parts of working at Toscanini's. She told us that each day brings changes to the menu. Over the course of the year, 300 to 400 flavors will appear on the list of daily offerings. This wealth of options ensures that at Toscanini's, there is something to satisfy any palette. And for those wary of flavors off the beaten path, all your standards are still represented. Most days, there are even vegan options. Not a fan of ice cream (there must be one of you out there)? Toscanini's doubles as an espresso bar, complete with pastries and tea.
 
Variety isnt the only thing Toscanini’s has going for it. The ice cream you eat here is all made in the back. In our opinion, its quality is unparalleled. We're fans of J.P. Licks (albeit, not of its bagels), and Emma has paid an estimated ten visits to the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Factory, but a single trip to Toscanini's was enough to convince us that, when it comes to ice cream, Central Square is where it's at. And since the location is computer friendly in the extreme (there is reliable Wi-Fi and a centrally located table equipped with outlets and Lamont-style lighting), we plan on returning during reading week to drown our doldrums in several scoops of ice cream.
 
Sofra
 
Sofra, an offshoot of the celebrated sit-down restaurant Oleana, has been open for almost five years. Following our visit, we are determined to spend the remainder of our Harvard careers making up for this half-decade of lost time. Each dish we sampled was truly unique and delicious—a couple, mind-bogglingly so!
 
To understand the mission of this tantalizing storefront, one need look no farther than the awning. Manager Ayse shared, "Sofra is a shared Turkish and Arabic word meaning 'a spread'—a table that has an array of dishes from sweet to savory… a table of celebration, of hospitality." In keeping with this emphasis on inclusiveness, Sofra's menu draws inspiration from a wealth of Middle Eastern cuisines. Turkish, Moroccan, Lebanese, and Egyptian all figure into the unique equation that makes this bakery unlike any other. Ayse explained that most of Sofra's recipes are not adapted from a single dish from a single country, but rather, "draw on the crossover of recipes."
I (Emma) do not think it is an exaggeration to dub the tiny mug of Turkish coffee I enjoyed a revelation. It is usually a good sign when your first thought is, "Does this contain chocolate?" It turns out all it is, is finely ground, unfiltered, stovetop brewed coffee, helped along only by a tablespoon of sugar.
 
Over the course of an indulgent half hour, we sampled eight items. Our agreed upon favorite was the kunefe. Ayse told us that this pastry, a sweet cheese custard that is soaked in star anise and clove syrup and topped with shredded filo dough, is often overlooked on account of its size (it is on the smaller side) and foreignness. But she thinks it's one of the best pastries Sofra has to offer. We concur.
 
Ayse described the pistachio Pop-Tart as a prime example of Sofra "taking ingredients that are traditionally used in the Middle East and twisting them into an American pastime." Compared to ordinary Pop-Tarts… well, there is just no comparison! Sofra's take on the pre-packaged snack boasts an exterior that is equal parts flaky and chewy, and a chunky pistachio filling. Biting into the whole of it provided just about the most unique experience of textures we have ever encountered.
 
The most popular pastry we tried was the morning bun. This item, which consists of chunks of croissant glued together by orange blossom glaze, has apparently developed something of a cult following. We empathize wholeheartedly with those who have fallen under its sticky-sweet spell.
 
Za'atar finger bread is not as obviously decadent as some of its pastry counter companions, but its taste is the one that has remained most in our minds. Za'atar is a spice mix that combines wild thyme, sumac, and sesame seeds. It is common in Palestine, Lebanon, Israel, and if we had our way, would be as perfunctory a condiment stateside as salt and pepper.
 
Flour
 
Even if most Harvard students haven't visited Flour, they are familiar with its story. Joanne B. Chang '91 graduated from Harvard with a degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics. She entered the culinary world several years later, after deciding she would rather be a cook than a consultant. In 2000, following stints at a handful of well-known restaurants, Chang opened the first branch of Flour. The bakery/café is now among the most celebrated storefronts in the Boston area.
 
Connie was feeling sick the morning we'd appointed for our trip to the MIT branch of the famed eatery, so I (Emma) hopped aboard the bus solo. Less than fifteen minutes later, I was contemplating my breakfast options. Flour boasts a spacious storefront, with a long counter and a large number of shockingly un-crowded tables. As I waited on line I noted the following options, each of which looked just as delicious as its name suggested: berry bread pudding, sticky bread pudding, two varieties of breakfast pocket, breakfast pizza, vegan chocolate cake, sour cream coffee cake. There were also a variety of muffins, and enormous airy meringues (so enormous, in fact, that the corner of one shielded the product's official name from view). After a deliberation session that endured as long as the line did (and could have continued), I settled on the breakfast special: French toast on focaccia with maple syrup.
 
I don't ordinarily go for daily specials, but this is an occasion where I am proud to have strayed from the beaten path. In recent years, there's been a perceptible movement toward the outrageous in the world of French toast. Cheesecake or strawberry stuffed incarnations of the simple dish have become increasingly common. Having sampled each of these fussy variants, it was a true delight to enjoy a slice of simple, delicious French toast. Where ordinary bread often tends to go to mush under the pressure, the sturdiness of the focaccia enabled it to hold up in the face of being drenched first in egg, then in syrup. Its chewiness, and slightly sour aftertaste, lent the dish a lunch-like, savory dimension that played well against the sweetness of the sugar and syrup.
 
I had the good fortune of sitting next to a family that decided to sample a variety of items. The sticky bun was described as "amazing;" the orange juice as "absolutely fresh." High praise also went to the quiche: "It has the texture of custard. It's wonderfully delicate and delicious."
 
They also tried the breakfast sandwich. Had I not been reluctant to go savory, considering the sweet bent of this article, I would absolutely have ordered this popular offering. As I sat enjoying my French toast, I had plenty of opportunities to admire it the sandwich from afar: creamy pat of egg (also described as custard-like), shiny arugula, puffy roll. I will return for you!
 
The atmosphere of Flour is almost as inviting as its menu. The breakfast area buzzes with the conversations of families and friends; an MIT student sat to my left, simultaneously working her way through a berry muffin and a p-set. Dishes are created in full view of customers: employees hard at work crafting sandwiches and cakes alike are backlit by a wall that bears the admonition: "make life sweeter…eat dessert first!"
 
If you say so, oh divine bakery.
