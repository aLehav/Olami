Harvard College promises its undergraduates a liberal arts education. Students are expected to leave campus after four years with a broad understanding of the social sciences, the natural sciences, and the humanities. This mission is, of course, what drives the Program in General Education. But what of students who are interested in studies that fall between the demarcation of disciplines? Can a siloed style of academics still prepare students effectively for entering a modern workforce?
Within Harvard’s online course catalog, undergraduate departmental classes are categorized under four distinct headings: Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The widespread ingrained sense of division between the arts and sciences traces back to popular ideas about brain lateralization: The left hemisphere processes logical information, and the right hemisphere, creative. Undergraduates searching for courses can seem to be in a similar world of intellectual hemispheres, and the College may have room to grow in cultivating more opportunities for academic overlap between the arts and sciences.
David A. Edwards, a professor of the practice of biomedical engineering, sees an inherent intellectual link between the arts and sciences. “When it comes to doing traditional science, we rely on certainty of conditions and constraints so we can solve problems and produce results, whereas famously art flourishes in ambiguity and uncertainty,” Edwards says. “It turns out that when it comes to science, going to frontiers and exploring and discovering, there are no constraints, and the role of ambiguity and uncertainty is critical. Frontiers are places where ambiguity and uncertainty flourish.”
Andrew P. Warren, an associate professor in Harvard’s English Department, agrees with this view of the disciplines naturally intersecting. And he’s found a history in the notion: “There’s a big book called the ‘Age of Wonder’ by Richard Holmes, which is about how the Romantic poets were reading a lot of science, thinking about science, and were actually deeply interested— in changing the way in which science was done.”

But something is inherently contemporary about an academic melding of the disciplines, Warren acknowledges. “People in English are actually studying science more than they used to, meaning professors [and] graduate students are writing about the relationship between science and literature. I study Romantic literature, and that has often been seen as an era that has been anti-science. In the last 10 years, science has been one of the biggest approaches to that sort of literature,” he says.
Edwards also notes the relatively recent change in academic mindsets and sees it as reflecting broader societal shifts. “We are today in an era where we’re kind of all living in the frontier, because of sustainability issues relating to both to the environment and to new levels of human interaction. There’s all sorts of newness everyone is waking up to, that breeds some angst, but for those who thrive in an frontier, it’s an amazing moment, where everyone’s invited to discover,” he says.
Harvard University—with a $35.7 billion endowment—does not lack capital for academic discourse. Naturally, many have been able to mine the resources on campus to pursue interdisciplinary approaches to the arts and sciences. Robin Kelsey, dean of arts and humanities at Harvard, expresses the University’s openness to experimentation. “I think we’re at an exciting moment when it comes to crossing these boundaries and bringing the arts and sciences together,” he says. “I think now is the moment to bake these initiatives and these aims into the curriculum and structure of Harvard more deeply.”

Inactive Crimson arts writer Rebecca A. Greenberg ’18 founded Ecdysis, a magazine showcasing different forms of art that celebrate a scientific concept, last year. She was largely inspired by her organismic and evolutionary biology 10 class with professor Brian D. Farrell, who now serves as the magazine’s academic adviser: “It’s already been known that there are health benefits to going outside, like for prison inmates or elderly. But professor Farrell is actually proposing that knowing more of the biology behind the nature you are seeing helps make you more familiar with where you are and gives you more appreciation of where you are—  an aesthetic appreciation. So in that way, beauty, health, and science are all linked together,” she says.
When she began advertising for submissions to the magazine on campus, she had been expecting about 40 pieces for the first issue—and received 84 submissions. The works in the most recent issue of Ecdysis are a collection of artistic depictions of scientific concepts, in the form of photos, drawings, or literary work meant to be thought-provoking or aesthetically pleasing. “It’s not really even creating, it’s more like bringing awareness to what’s already there. So for example, this is a cicada [on the cover of the most recent Ecdysis issue]… a very realist drawing of a cicada that Dennis, one of my classmates [Dennis Zhang ’18], made, but the idea is that it’s also beautiful in that you can break down every analytical point, and in that way it’s also scientific. So the art and the science—you can’t really separate one from the other,” Greenberg says.
In the realm of academics, students have also been able to find ways to blend the disciplines. Yi Jean Chow ’13, for example, a joint concentrator in English and chemistry and physics, wrote her thesis on the role of science in James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” “The major component was to try and make the case of reading Ulysses as we would read perhaps a scientific textbook, insofar as scientific textbooks are not meant to be read linearly; they have puzzles or questions; they’re not the traditional literature in the way we would think of literature. But in a way, neither is Ulysses or any of the modernist works of literature at the time,” Chow says.
Her novel approach to her studies did not go unnoticed—her thesis was awarded a Hoopes Prize—and she was happy with her decision to go down a new path. ”Something that really strikes me is this sort of education where you are doing different things and you are picking up things from different majors and mixing and matching things. I think it really is a new way of learning, and it is the future model for how to educate college students,” she says.
Hana Bajramovic ’13 was also awarded a Hoopes Prize the same year for her thesis on the cognitive effects of unreliable narrators on readers. She was similarly pleased that she was able to bridge certain fields of science and arts in doing so. “Any time you take two things that are not meant to be combined and find an interesting and creative way to link them, you’re developing a skill that’s more broadly applicable. The ability to bridge gaps between disciplines is a creative and mental exercise that has much broader applicability outside of writing a thesis,” Bajramovic says.
Another student who found opportunity to blend the arts and sciences beyond his time at Harvard is Benjamin Lopez Barba ’15. He was one of the first people to go through the architectural studies track of the history of art and architecture concentration and now works as a video game designer at Rockstar San Diego, a video game development studio. “To get your foot in the door, those hard skills like knowing how to code and program are really essential; those are like the bare minimum. Then once you have those skills set, anything you can bring to the table—which would be my design background—helps you stand out,” Lopez Barba says. “I think it’s definitely about balancing your desire to pursue more creative aspects of a given medium with concrete hard skills that you can show to your employer and prove to him that you can get the work done.”
In fact, the skills gained from interdisciplinary studies have real-world benefits that go far beyond the classroom. “I think that Harvard has always been providing students the most relevant and timely information they needed to enter the workforce, but in an age where information is a commodity, we need to be training individuals for a jobless future—one where you create your own job,” Edwards says. Harvard, he adds, is not quite yet serving as the ideal environment for crossing disciplines. “But the rapidity of change at a University with such a long tradition makes it hard to react in the same moment,” he says.
Kelsey acknowledges the academic ramifications of Harvard’s legacy. “I think it is true that these changes are hard to make because of how deeply rooted the disciplines are here, but at the same time, the best interdisciplinary work draws upon a deep understanding of individual disciplines,” he says. “So although it may be harder here, I think our ceiling is higher.”
In November 2007, University President Drew Faust initiated a Harvard-wide Task Force on the Arts, which eventually issued a report that stated: “To allow innovation and imagination to thrive on our campus, to educate and empower creative minds across all disciplines, to help shape the twenty-first century, Harvard must make the arts an integral part of the cognitive life of the university.” The task force said that physical spaces, structural elements, and undergraduate curriculum all merited improvement. But the task force released its report at the beginning of the 2008 financial crisis, and in light of budget constraints, recommendations have been slow to reach actualization.
For example, the Theater, Dance, and Media concentration did not receive the necessary funding and curriculum restructuring to come into being until fall 2015. “At a place like Harvard, everyone engages in the arts, but it’s more along the line of arts appreciation, more along the line of hobbies, less a discipline one studies seriously and writes about academically. Harvard has this setup—which we have only just started to break away from with TDM—where the arts are extracurricular,” says Bess Paupeck, the program manager of Arts @ 29 Garden, Harvard’s initiative that provides academic and extracurricular endeavors the space and resources for further integration of artistic components.
A small number of classes that academically engage with both the arts and sciences in a reasonably equal way are actually offered to Harvard undergrads. Some courses, like Computer Science 50, allow students to bring in some artistic flavoring for a final project. But the sense of a real academic union between the two disciplines is still nascent. “To me, the danger is the suggestion that the arts are just there to support and enhance the sciences, and not the other way around,” Paupeck says.
Michael C. Kennedy-Yoon ’17 is a pre-medical student but is concentrating in visual and environmental studies. He’s enjoyed the intellectual advantages of an appreciation for uncertainty—common in visual arts—that strengthens him against the potential for being paralyzed by the unknown, a pitfall for many science students. “But in terms of actual academic intersections, for me, there have been basically none,” he says. “I would have loved classes like that.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane noted in an email that the Program in General Education offers a number of interdisciplinary courses that fall outside the  divisions of Harvard’s online course catalog. On the whole, however, it seems that Harvard would encourage students to take interdisciplinary work into their own hands when it comes to blending arts and sciences. “A student interested in integrating two areas of study may apply to pursue a joint concentration. Students may even choose to design their own customized field of study—and their advisers can help them craft a plan that best accords with their personal academic goals,” Dane wrote.
In contrast, some other universities have already started to implement this kind of curricular blending into their formal academic structures. Carnegie Mellon University is one of a few schools that has started to offer interdisciplinary undergraduate degrees, such as a Bachelor of Design. The University of Utah, similarly, has an Entertainment, Arts, and Engineering graduate program—one of the top in the country—through which it also offers undergraduate emphasis tracks. The Entertainment, Arts, and Engineering program started in 2006 and allows computer science or film majors the opportunity to choose an academic path that focuses on aspects of the digital entertainment industry.
Dr. Roger A. Altizer Jr., co-founder and associate director of the program, is a strong supporter of bringing interdisciplinary style learning to higher education. “I think the key to success for the combination of the sciences and the arts on a campus is taking interdisciplinary seriously, as its own discipline,” he says. “This is not what universities were designed to do. Universities were designed to be very siloed—to go very deep in particular forms of knowledge.”

“If you don’t have a banner to march under, the bureaucracies will destroy any interdisciplinary effort. Just the sheer overhead of managing budgets between departments, or who gives credit for students or what conferences papers should be submitted to or even what counts as a project, becomes extraordinarily difficult for students and junior faculty on a campus,” he says.
At Columbia University, administrators are in the process of creating an interdisciplinary program called the Collaboratory.  “Generally speaking there is a data science silo and other parts of our lives, other disciplines, business, history humanities, biology, science, those tend to be separate, so if one were to decide to use the tools of data science, for example, in a history context… the historian would have to work with a technical expert who is educated in data science.  What would happen if you taught data science and computational science in the context of history?” asks Christopher N. McGarry, the director for Entrepreneurship at Columbia’s Office of Alumni and Development. The Collaboratory addresses this by having classes taught by experts from two different fields. “You need a program like the Collaboratory to give permission for interdisciplinary combination… to shake things up a bit and encourage more interdisciplinary curricular development,” McGarry says.
Stanford, like Harvard, launched a university-wide Arts Initiative (though in 2006), pushing for new faculty positions and graduate fellowships, three new buildings, and new programs for Stanford students. “A major priority has been supporting interdisciplinary approaches in the arts, including intersections with the sciences,” says Matthew Tiews, Stanford's associate dean for the advancement of the arts. “A few examples: the ongoing artsCatalyst grant fosters interdisciplinary arts experiences in the classroom, the Senior Reflection is a capstone courses series for students in Biology pursuing creative projects, and the new interdisciplinary honors program in the arts is open to students of any major.”
On the whole, undergraduate-level studies at Harvard are more compartmentalized by department when compared to graduate school counterparts. One answer to this problem may be rooted in intra-university interactions.
“The engineering school and the architecture school, they could totally be buddy-buddy. Then, in that way, architecture would blend more into the engineering undergrad. And we don’t have enough graduate-undergraduate collaboration. How valuable would that be, in terms of thinking and engineering? Across-university integration would be a place to start. I can imagine all kinds of things, like the dance department and physics department. Things like this are happening down the street and across the river. They’re just not happening here as directly as other places,” Paupeck says.

This is certainly a possibility as the school of engineering and applied sciences expands to a new campus at Allston. “[The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences] views the school’s expansion to new facilities at Allston as a magnificent opportunity to do this in a much more proactive way. A lot of the kinds of things one might imagine require space and that’s something we simply don’t have today,” says Paul C. Karoff, the assistant dean for communications at SEAS.  While it will be some time before the Allston campus is completed, the attitude at SEAS is hopeful for those wishing to combine engineering or applied sciences with the arts. “There is a lot of open-mindedness, interest, and enthusiasm on the part of the dean and faculty at SEAS to explore opportunities to bring together the aesthetic and artistic with the technical and scientific realms,” Karoff says.
Lopez Barba seemed to see the limits of traditional undergraduate-style education during his time at Harvard: “The Graduate School of Design had some courses that were not offered at the undergraduate level… When you’re in between fields, as I ended up being at the end of my four years, it’s hard to find someone who specializes in those in-between areas.”
Altizer provides an explanation for possible shortages of guidance in the interdisciplinary spaces. “The systems of a university are designed to reward you for disciplinary behavior. If you are a new faculty member, if you don’t show disciplinary confidence or publishing in particular journals or going to specific conferences, you won’t get tenure in your discipline. With tenure it’s really easy to be interdisciplinary, but when you’re new to the university, you really have to step the way they tell you to step,” he says.
Will Harvard ever be able to bridge that gap? Edwards sees a good start on Harvard’s campus in the realm of making. “Harvard has come a long way since I came here in 2001,” Edwards says. “For one thing there are a lot more ‘making’ classes, in film, Science of Cooking, etc. And that’s really a new area.”
One of the best opportunities for interdisciplinary ‘making’ at Harvard right now may lie in the dance program. Jill Johnson, dance director at Harvard’s Office for the Arts and a senior lecturer in TDM, says that her work engages substantially with the sciences. The research and creation of new dance pieces for performance on campus have used, for example, the study of ether during the Civil War, the pendulum wave effect, and the physics theory of beat behavior. “All kinds of dance companies are endeavoring to create multidisciplinary works. And that’s really reflected in the culture, not just the arts, just because the arts are now so interdisciplinary,” she says.
Johnson also references a yearly collaboration she engages in with Harvard Graduate School of Education’s professor, Gigi Luk. The two work together to teach a gross motor skills and cognition workshop as part of the Education School’s course H-112: Cognitive Neuroscience and Education.
Altizer, interestingly, also cites dance as a source for artistic influence in a scientific endeavor. “I’m working with a professor of dance and psychologists and game developers to create a virtual reality experience to help children with autism learn to self-soothe. The idea is teaching them choreographic thinking using virtual reality, bringing order to chaos,” he says.
Students at Harvard themselves have taken advantage of the robust dance department and movement resources at Harvard. Physics concentrator Mariel Pettee ’14 received high honors for her work on her thesis—an interdisciplinary dance installation on the Higgs boson performed on five floors at Farkas Hall.
“Part of this is creating the conditions for this kind of collaboration to happen, and literally I think for us that means spaces that provide different levels of advancing that,” Johnson says. “I see it across everything from courses to extracurricular to even just discussions. So I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue to flourish.”
Kelsey echoes her sentiments. “I also see this developing with respect to spaces devoted to making activity. There are a lot of students and postdocs and faculty members who have a newly keen interest in ‘making’ activity, and those activities, to date, have been too siloed,” he says. “My hope is that the institution will begin to develop spaces where students and faculty across these boundaries can come together and learn from one another. I believe that people are envisioning these kinds of spaces and that this goal has the backing of the administration, at every level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bruno Mars is a fantastic vocal technician. Along with his Hooligans ensemble and his stalwart, endlessly nostalgic production team of Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine, and Brody Brown—now going by the retro-appropriate Shampoo Press & Curl moniker—Mars has carved out a place in Billboard Top 100 history not for stylistic ingenuity or innovation but for his simple ability to evoke the most effective high notes and crescendos from the patchwork history of rhythm and blues. "24K Magic" is Mars’s most explicit and unified statement of homage, primarily to the 1980s West Coast heroes who brought synth-heavy sex and beat-boxed swagger to the mainstream.
Mars entirely eschews the features and genre wanderings of his first two albums for a palette of updates on the ’80s theme, borrowing equally from the silkiness of Michael Jackson’s early-decade ballads and Bell Biv Devoe’s turn-of-the-’90s New Jack Swing bangers. His concise, 33-minute LP shows a voice whose imitative capacities know no bounds; Mars’s vaguely grungy high notes, delightful scoops, and sudden lyrical runs act as true memorials to a musical golden age. When Mars tries to bring 2016 into his pastiche, however, the illusion falls apart—the crudity and pop sensibility of some of his verses breaks the spell of his time capsule appeal. Occasionally Mars steers clear of the present and allows his voice to fully blend into his band’s exquisite harmonies. When he does, "24K Magic" is an admirable, high-definition redux of 1980s Los Angeles R&B manna.
“Versace on the Floor,” the album’s most memorable melody, is the best example of both the crude pitfalls and the transcendent musicality of Mars’s imitative approach. The track, addressed as a seductive come-on, has Mars telling his lover, “Let’s just kiss until we’re naked; Versace on the floor.” There are plenty of pre-Migos musical references to Versace, and late 1980s crooner-icons like Aaron Hall or Johnny Gill were explicit—their blunt sexual honesty was central to their popularity—but these seductions felt less self-consciously narrated and cheesy-commercial. Virile descriptions of stripping are more believable as spontaneous moans than as luxury punchlines that top out at an impossibly layered high D. Even if the chorus dilutes the sexuality, however, Mars’s run of “Take it off for me, for me, for me…” is legitimately arousing, while the keyboard solo that follows is a uniquely convincing approximation of 1980s bombast in an era rife with synthmasters self-awarely bent on recapturing the unself-awareness of their favorite pre-Internet groups. The work of Shampoo Press & Curl on the song’s outro is a thing of beauty.
The album has plenty of similarly inspired referential moments. The intro to its impressive finale, “Too Good to Say Goodbye,” is a guitar-synthesizer twang reminiscent of Marcus Miller’s work with Luther Vandross. “Chunky,” a paean to “girls who pay rent on time” in the vein of Drake’s questionably-feminist 2010 “Fancy,” has a bass line that sounds as dynamic as Dr. Dre’s early beats. “Straight Up & Down,” another foreplay jam, is the cut closest to being a legitimate throwback—no references to iPhones or conspicuous autotune. Besides a moment where Mars sings “this liquor got both of us faded” and a resultant trappy two-second echo (and if the drums weren’t so perfectly mixed), the song could be from 1987.
If “24K Magic” fully embraced its commentary on 1980s R&B, it could move beyond its pop trappings and enter the rarified realm of the concept album. Mars and Co., however, can’t seem to escape the impulse for the caffeinated, post-social media call-and-response. Maybe “Uptown Funk” has unfairly saturated this trope, but Mars’s reliance on spoken word breakdowns that are too slow to qualify as rap verses but too sustained to evoke funk breaks the mood of otherwise atmospheric tracks. These runs are also where Mars is most liable to bring in trite elements of 2016 culture—the “hashtag blessed” in the title track, “forget your Instagram and your Twitter” in the James Brown-inspired “Perm,” and a Halle Berry answering machine gag at the end of the forgettable “Calling All My Lovelies.” This is not to suggest that artists need to be consistent in their throwbacks—that would be pretentious and stodgy (never!)—but Mars’s invocations of the present are uninteresting. Given that he is competing against a hip-hop landscape rife with increasingly compelling one-liner pop culture collages (see: Young Thug’s “JEFFERY”), these references are unnecessary.
Despite Mars’s unfortunate inability to fully embody the 1980s, “24K Magic” is his most complete and entertaining album, devoid of the insincere saccharine of “Doo-Wops and Hooligans” and the overly aggressive anthems of “Unorthodox Jukebox.” Here, Mars appears more concerned with sex than love, harmony than hook, and mood than lyric. He doesn’t always achieve an immersive R&B-Early MTV experience, but his statement often emerges as a well-intentioned and surprisingly on-point tribute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1966, a year after he released his magnum opus, “Otis Blue,” and a year before his death, Otis Redding performed at Los Angeles’s famed Whisky a Go Go club—one of the first soul artists to play there. Although he didn’t truly become popular across America after these performances, they helped launch him to prominence after he received glowing reviews by the Los Angeles Times and was applauded by Bob Dylan. Redding wanted to make a live album to supplement the shows, in the style of James Brown, to try to extend his popularity outside his black audience base.
“We’re hoping that this be one of the greatest albums that ever come out. We need to eat!” Redding proclaimed in concert. Originally the live album was shelved by Redding’s record labels, Volt and Atco, because the sound quality was poor. The first volume of “Live at the Whiskey a Go Go” was issued the year after Otis Redding died. Several more volumes were released as single CDs or as collections as time went on. On Oct. 28, however, the complete recordings of Redding’s stay at the Whisky a Go Go were released, providing an incredible look into Redding’s performance.
Redding played seven sets over three nights about a week after he’d released “The Soul Album.” As a result, the shows tended to feature some repeats, with the biggest offender being his cover of The Rolling Stones’s “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which he plays 10 times (although some of these are alternate versions of the song). Another reason for the repeats is that Redding said he wanted to make sure he got the songs he was playing right for the album, so he tried to get the perfect versions of his biggest songs, like “Respect,” “Security,” “Mr. Pitiful,” and “I Can’t Turn You Loose.” Redding played to the predominantly white crowd, trying to give them the best possible taste of his music in a single set (he only wanted people to stay for one set, as opposed to the whole day). Correspondingly, the only aspect of the recordings that sounds repetitive is the intros by Al “Brisco” Clark, who gives pretty much the same drawn-out introduction for Otis Redding each time.
The first day of the show, the audience doesn’t sound energized at all, but over the course of the next two days, the audience grows more involved, likely because of the positive reviews papers were giving Redding’s shows. The most interesting part of the performances is that few songs from Redding’s album, “The Soul Album,” (1966) are performed, save for his new single, “Good to Me,” which he introduces variously as “a song we just wrote” or “a song we made up just now.”  This was likely a way for him to plug the single so that the audience would buy it, an effective method of self-advertisement in an era before music videos and widespread musical distribution via radio and internet. “Live At The Whisky A Go Go” shows Redding micromanaging much of the show, repeating songs, stage banter, and introductions just to nail the perfect take for the live album. Redding utilized every moment on stage to further his career, promoting his new single and covering hit songs by white artists like The Beatles—whatever he needed to get the audience to buy his records.
For all of Redding’s label’s concerns about the quality of the album being poor, the complete recordings suggest otherwise. Redding’s flow is spectacular,and his vocal energy is raw and charismatic. The song variety also helps. Redding and his band play around 18 different songs, some slow and some fast. The new single, “Good to Me,” often falls flat, but tracks like “Any Ole Way,” “Respect,” “Security,” “I Can’t Turn You Loose,” and “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” hit the hardest. These are the songs that Redding executes perfectly. Any track where he could get people dancing seem to excite him.
By the end of the last show, Redding clearly felt that he had enough takes of the staple songs he was performing and decided to record some alternate material, covering songs like “A Hard Day’s Night” and “Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag.” When he cut the take early to say, “We don’t play James Brown; we play Otis Redding,” a fan responded with, “Who’s James Brown?” While Redding’s stint at the Whisky A Go Go doesn’t match Brown’s legendary performances at the Apollo, these recordings are good enough to evoke that reaction—especially as they give insight into one of soul’s most calculating minds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When my father was a freshman in college, before he shifted his focus from ping pong to academic study, he submitted a year-end term paper that was largely someone else's work. It was the first and last time he plagiarized. The fear of getting caught was a powerful motivator in not doing so again, but the greater motivation was his realization that he had something to say, and that never again would he allow someone else to say it for him.
In other cases, plagiarism can occur by coincidence, produced merely by commonality of thought. What a terrifying thought—that your genuinely personal experiences are reproducible in other people. Our anxiety about being individuals causes us to police plagiarism in the academic field. And then we also have to worry about attacks of cryptomnesia, which occur when an old forgotten memory returns and is believed to be a new inspiration. I once read a friend’s poems, and a year and a half later I stole his dedication, without knowing it, and used it to dedicate my own work with. A few months later I was talking with my friend about it. He was not an ignorant ass—and so when I said, "I know now where I stole it, but whom did YOU steal it from?", he said, "I don't remember; I only know I stole it from somebody, because I have never originated anything altogether myself, nor met anyone who had."
Even the originals are not original. There is imitation, model, and suggestion, to the very archangels, if we knew their history. I was born with words in my mouth —“Band-Aid,” “Q-tip,” “Xerox.” The world is a home littered with pop-culture products and their emblems. I can no more claim today’s cultural environment as “mine” than the sidewalks and forests of the world, yet I do dwell in it, and for me to stand a chance as either artist or citizen, I’d probably better be permitted to name it. Apprentices graze in the field of culture: It’s tremendously difficult to come up with new ideas in any given field until you know what has already been done there, because you will likely draw the same inferences based on what has been done before.
Plagiarism is not an ethical issue. It constitutes a procedural issue (copying another’s paper can get you expelled) and a legal issue (stealing chords from the hit 1963 song “He’s So Fine,” as George Harrison allegedly did, can get you a copyright infringement suit). But if the punitive system is not concerned with the ethical aspect of plagiarism, why, then, does plagiarism fill us with moral disgust?
In the children’s classic “The Velveteen Rabbit,” the Skin Horse explains to the Rabbit that the value of a new toy lies not in what it’s made of, but rather in how the toy is used. “Real isn’t how you are made…. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.” The Rabbit is fearful: “Does it hurt?” Reassuring him, the Skin Horse says: “It doesn’t happen all at once…. You become. It takes a long time…. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.” Seen from the perspective of the toymaker, the Velveteen Rabbit’s loose joints and missing eyes represent vandalism, signs of misuse and rough treatment; but for others, these are marks of its loving use. When a new work of art is created, the past is altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past. And the poet who is aware of this will be aware of great difficulties and responsibilities—including the responsibility that my father discovered in his freshmen year.
Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. Neurological study has lately shown that memory, imagination, and consciousness itself is stitched, quilted, pastiched. If we cut-and-paste our selves, might we not forgive it of our artworks? We may often find that not only the best, but the most individual parts of his work may be those in which the dead poets, his ancestors, assert their immortality most vigorously.

This column is entirely plagiarized. The idea itself for plagiarizing an essay on plagiarism was taken from Jonathan Lethem’s essay called “The Ecstasy of Influence.” This key of citations lists the sources that I pulled from. (Also note that I did revise bits and pieces in order to keep the tone consistent or better fit the word constraint.)
Title taken from a review of A Christmas Tale, a movie by French director Arnaud Desplechin. The review was written by Dennis Lim.
“When my father… someone else to say it for him.” - My father, Glenn Gibbs.
The ideas in “In other cases… academic field” - proposed by English doctorate student Chris Schlegel.
“I once read… nor met anyone who had.’” - from a letter written by Mark Twain to Helen Keller, in which he responds to her plagiarism scandal. The letter was published in the book “Mark Twain’s Letters.” I tweaked the situation slightly to make it more believable.
The first sentence of the third paragraph is quoted directly from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1904 essay, “Quotation and Originality.”
“I was born… ‘Xerox.’” Jonathan Lethem.
“The world is… pop-culture products…” Also from Lethem’s essay, but originally expressed by Kembrew McLeod, Freedom of Expression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Houghton is described as a rare books and manuscripts library, but that description is definitely a misnomer. The library’s collection is not only restricted to books and manuscripts, nor does it stop in the realm of the printing, graphic, and book arts either. A significant part of the Houghton archive is composed of physical objects that sometimes have nothing to do with books and manuscripts, and that barely explored corner of the collection yields some of its most fascinating articles. The home of these realia is the Z-Closet Collection, which students can explore online on HOLLIS. The items there, some of which are listed below, are some of the most unique and unconventional materials in the library. Their presence in the library’s archive, however, only makes it a richer place, and the objects and the stories they tell can yield interesting approaches to the personalities and events to which they are connected.
First and foremost, the Z-Closet contains a surprising number of famous people’s death masks. Although this sounds morbid, death masks are a fascinatingly personal way to come into contact with figures who were larger than life. Death masks also bring us closer to a quintessentially human aspect of these timeless personalities: their mortality. Among the death masks at Houghton, one can find those belonging to American poet e. e. cummings, Irish novelist James Joyce, Harvard professor and renowned philosopher and psychologist William James, American novelist Henry James (supposedly cast by William James, who was his nephew, after a request by American impressionist painter John Singer Sargeant), English dictator Oliver Cromwell, Emperor Napoleon I of France, American editor and scholar Charles Eliot Norton, Italian poet Dante Alighieri, and American poet Walt Whitman, among others.
Other eerie relics kept in the closet are multiple locks of hair—again, a peculiar yet personal way to interact with history’s notables. When reading a history textbook or writing a literature paper, the people described therein often appear to be disembodied phantoms; their historical weight, it seems, dehumanizes them. Seeing and thinking about something like these people’s hair brings them back into the world in a tangible way, and understanding how and why their hair was conserved in the first place also helps to determine] their cultural context and personal history. Houghton has hair that belonged to Scottish novelist Robert Louis Stevenson, English Romantic poet William Wordsworth, Napoleon Bonaparte, American Dark Romantic novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle.
Also worthy of mention are a copy of “Oidhche Sheanchais,” the first sound motion picture in Irish; top secret maps from the First World War made for General Pershing as he battled the Germans in France; a brick from President Ulysses S. Grant’s temporary tomb; a Thai printing type from the nineteenth century; the key to Napoleon’s bedroom in the South Atlantic island of St. Helena, where he was exiled until his death in 1821, as well as the emperor’s stationery; George Washington’s mantel clock; a colonial Massachusetts coin collection; English novelist Charles Dickens’s walking stick, ivory letter opener, and brass seal; T. S. Eliot’s panama straw hat, which Eliot purchased at the Coop; Victorian English art critic John Ruskin’s magnifying glass, which, according to a manuscript text in its box, was “always in his pocket”; and even a Yale Bicentennial medal made by Tiffany & Co.
The Z-Closet also contains my favorite item at Houghton: an alarm clock from Communist China depicting Mao Zedong surrounded by followers waving copies of his “Little Red Book” (call no. MS Chinese 15, HOLLIS no. 014347915). A modern anthropological relic from the Cultural Revolution-era, totalitarian society where mass production is the norm, it can be studied from a surprising variety of lenses and contextualized in multifarious ways. Like everything else listed above—and everything at Houghton in general—the clock tells someone else’s story, but also has a story of its own that is worth exploring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The walls and fences of Harvard Yard are punctuated by gates. Many of these are topped with complex patterns of grillwork, at the center of which sit the years of the classes that donated them. The grillwork stands out, almost in silhouette, as dark, sharp lines and shapes against the bright sky.
Gates, by nature, are viewed from two directions: the outside as you enter and the inside as you exit. Grillwork can also be viewed from both sides, but one side is the reverse of the other. With abstract and symmetrical shapes, this duality works nicely. However, a number that looks right from one side will look backwards from the other. Therefore, in designing a gate with a number, the artist must favor one viewpoint over another. As I walked around the Yard, I found that many of the gates were oriented outwards, so that from the inside the numbers appeared backwards. In some cases, a flat background allowed the artist to include two sets of numbers, one oriented inward and one outward. While this solves the problem of the backwards numerals, it sacrifices the stark and beautiful contrast of the numbers against the backdrop of the sky. In no cases were the numbers oriented inwards, so that to view them from the outside was to view them backwards.
On the most literal level, this is a practical choice. A tourist or visitor who has come to see Harvard is more likely to stop and look up at a gate than a student running to class who passes it every day, and it seems that tourist is more likely to stop on the way in than the way out. The implication, though, is somewhat larger: At least in some sense, the architecture of Harvard Yard is designed not for the sake of the students but for the purpose of projecting an image to the outside world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is Nov. 22, 2016, and the newly minted Senior Counselor to Donald Trump is angry. Even if Asians are navigating America fairly, Steve Bannon doesn’t like the fact that there are so many Asian CEOs in Silicon Valley. “A country is more than an economy,” he explained. “We’re a civic society.” Apparently Asians still tear apart the social fabric of this country if we do too well.
It is Nov. 22, 2016, and Harvard is about to break for Thanksgiving. And for many people at Harvard, there seems to be awfully little to be thankful for.
But let’s just remember that Donald Trump won the election because a lot of white Americans don’t think there’s very much to be thankful for too.
***
Thanksgiving is part of America’s founding myth. It’s the day when the Pilgrims first truly felt at home in their new country. And as the country awakened to race, we redefined Thanksgiving as a time when whites and Native Americans broke bread together.
Yet, except in times of war, America has never been a truly united nation. The notion of a united America has survived for so long because our federal system—the division of Americans into partially self-governing states—makes it easy to overlook the true depth of our internal divisions.  The modern disintegration of federalism has forced Americans to realize that we’re not so similar after all, and never have been.
Trump’s America recalls the past as homogeneous nonetheless. It blames immigration, both a consequence and harbinger of the future, for destroying that past, and with it American identity. (This is, of course, only one foundation of Trumpism, but it’s the one that threatens to change America the most.) Of course, the past was not homogeneous; society simply has a selective memory.  There were minorities before immigration: They were called black people, and society simply ignored them. But at least we know what Steve Bannon was talking about.
As Ronald Reagan first understood, revisionist nostalgia still wields an astonishing psychic power that can be bent to any purpose. Many college students seek to transcend the past. But we can either come to terms with the past and recall that there was something good about it, or we can be overwhelmed by millions of voters seeking to make America great again.
In particular, we can try to recreate the true foundations of the “civic society” that white America thinks it once enjoyed—by delivering economic growth for all, emphasizing immigrants’ shared desire for stable communities, and not talking down to Trump’s America. Yes, there are Trump voters who believe in white nationalism. That’s obvious. But Trump wouldn’t have won without the remnants of the Silent Majority—people who are not racist but will tolerate prejudiced rhetoric in service of what they feel is a greater purpose. People who are still coming to terms with the fact that this country is bigger and deeper and far more diverse than they had ever imagined.
White working-class Americans have learned to play identity politics. We can try to create a new American identity that includes them, even if their vision doesn’t include us. If not…well, there are more of them, and their votes count the same as ours.
***
Part of me has always wanted to be Tom Wolfe, journalist/auteur/literary marvel.  I am precisely none of these things, but I know what Michael Lewis meant about Wolfe when he said: “He dresses exotically and is talented and intellectually powerful, like the sophisticates in the bubble. But he isn’t really one of them. To an extent that shocks the people inside the bubble, when they learn of it, he shares the values of the hinterland. He believes in God, Country, and even, up to a point, Republican Presidents.”
Never having a bubble of your own lets you see inside the worlds of others with greater clarity.
While there are many people of color who are angry about the Trump election, the angriest people I’ve seen have all been friendly liberal white people on Facebook—the sort of people who think that the arc of liberty bends towards justice, or at least towards Harvard Square.
To them, I can only say one thing from my own experience: It doesn’t feel right to make nice with people who break bread with racists. But let me repeat: Their votes count the same as mine. The impeachment truthers and the National Popular Vote idealists do me no good. The Silent Majority, on the other hand, can still shout down the racists, if only you can get them on your side. Compromise is not a dirty word when it is a necessity, and the moment has never demanded our empathy more. It is time to come to terms with the present.
After the election, a lot of people at Harvard—all of them white—told me, “I don’t know whether I’m at home at this country anymore.” In my experience, white people at Harvard—the allies that people of color like me need if we are going to find our place in Trump’s America—felt so lost in the past two weeks because they thought a liberal America was both their home and their birthright.
But as a person of color, I’ve never expected these things.
Being Asian in America teaches you to keep your aspirations realistic. Only white people threaten to move to Canada.
And yet without aspirations there is no America at all. It’s why I stayed in America instead of moving to Vancouver, why I’ve kept on fighting to be American, even when union workers yell racial slurs at me and establishment types use me as the new “Some of my best friends are black.” Hell, it’s why I title my column “Letters from Cambridge.” America is home, and someday it will feel that way.
I am used to being the odd person out—the Chinese in America, the American in China, the Christian in California, the conservative at Harvard. I get it. I’m not sure Trump voters actually get it, but they think they do, and that’s the important thing. As hard as it is for me to say: Like me, all Trump voters really want is some place—or someone—to send their letters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I watched Michael Brown’s mother speak to the press for the first time with my two best friends. We sat in silence, tears rolling down our cheeks, turning over the question of how this could have happened in our minds.
A year later, I held the hands of the same two girls, while we watched Tamir Rice’s mother make an all too similar speech. A year before, none of us would have thought we’d be in the same position. We thought seeing and hearing one mother’s overwhelming grief would be enough for this country to understand.
I should have known better, because we’ve seen mother after mother stand before us and try to make sense of how their babies ended up dead so early and so unfairly. It goes all the way back to Mamie Till, Emmett Till’s mother, who’s heartbreak was so profound that she left the casket of her 14 year old son’s mutilated body open for the world to see.
We see a black mother crying about her dead child every other day.
Every time I watch the familiar hunched over body, see the bloodshot and teary eyes, hear the shaky and shallow breaths, I think of my mother. I imagine her standing in front of the hundred microphones, trying to hold it together as she thinks about her dead black baby.
I could easily be the next person considered too threatening by the police. My 5-foot-10-inch stature, pigmented skin, and smart mouth could intersect at the wrong time and wrong place and leave me bleeding out in the street.
My mother is different though. Unlike Geneva Reed-Veal, or Sybrina Fulton, or Lucy McBath, my skin does not match that of my mother. Her skin shows bright and white, complimented by blonde hair and green eyes. I’m brown, coffee, or caramel colored.
My white mother has shaped every single part of my life. The simplest things—from how I take care of my hair, to what my ideal Thanksgiving meal looks like—are because of her. Her values, her language, her culture—they made me into the woman I am today. Her white skin gave me my lightness. It gave me my loose curls. It gave me my comfort in living and existing in the white world.
Her whiteness has characterized my life. And I don’t doubt it would characterize my death too.
My mother would stand in front of the nation, and cry about me, and people would listen. People would see her pain; they’d feel it twisting in their guts. Her words would carry a weight that would extend beyond a week of protest. Her words would reach beyond just the black community.
I know this because I’ve seen the difference having a white mother makes. I’ve seen it with my high school’s administration, who rarely listened to my black classmates’ black mothers, but always had ears for my mother. I’ve seen it in walking into stores and being immediately greeted versus being glanced at and ignored. I’ve seen it sitting on the curb, two cops in front of me, being giving the option of being escorted home instead going to the precinct after they spoke with her. After being caught red-handed breaking the law, my mother’s conversation with that police officer is what prevented me from spending the night in a cell.
I don’t worry about my death at the hands of a police officer, because I am confident my white mother will get me justice.
My white mother will make other people care.
My white mother will make the non-black people, who could turn the news off when they see my name in a headline, listen.
My white mother, will make people understand what it’s like to lose their child, just because they weren’t white.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the two weeks following the election of Donald Trump—after a campaign season characterized by racist and xenophobic rhetoric—there has been nationwide  spike in racially motivated hate crimes. Though it is tempting to assume that these crimes are quarantined in distant parts of the country, they have arrived on our campus in very tangible ways. Last week, members of the Romance Languages and Literatures department were verbally and physically harassed mere blocks from Harvard Yard. Given the ethnic diversity of the department, the crimes are a clear result of the toxic ideals that Donald Trump has legitimized and injected into the national mainstream.
We unequivocally condemn the craven and odious actions against members of the RLL department and all other aggression against Harvard affiliates in the aftermath of the election. Furthermore, we commend the department for taking the time and effort to stand in solidarity with the members of their community through a public letter, and we fully support their calls to  reaffirm and protect immigrant rights. Silence in the face of oppression is a far-too dangerous choice, so public statements that explicitly denounce hate crimes are critical.
In the same vein, the University must be more proactive in condemning hate crimes like these and guarantee that all students feel protected on this campus. Moreover, the Harvard University Police Department ought to take swift action to investigate these incidents and continue to ensure that community members are aware of available resources. Hotlines and bias reports will remain ineffective if members of this community do not know of their existence or feel unequipped to use them.
More broadly, these incidents speak to the atmosphere that president-elect Donald Trump has tacitly sanctioned, if not outright fostered throughout his campaign. In addition to his rhetoric, he has vacillated on the outspoken support he received from various white supremacist groups, reintroducing their loathsome ideas into the national mainstream and creating the backdrop on which these events were able to occur. Despite his flirtation with these groups, Trump has ignored his accountability for the aftershocks of his election. In his recent interview with “60 Minutes”,  he ironically expressed surprise and dismay at the nationwide acts of harassment, assuming a presidential demeanor and urging the perpetrators to “stop it.” This disingenuous response misrepresents Trump’s levels of complicity with these fringe movements throughout his campaign—as evidenced by his equivocations on white supremacists—and he must take full responsibility, as the next president of the United States, to combat the animus he has stoked by his sins of both commission and omission.

A Harvard student may have invented Facebook, but the Admissions Office remains skeptical of the value of reviewing social media profiles in applications to the College.
Recently, articles in media outlets such as the New York Times and Forbes have speculated whether it can be advantageous to include social media as a component in college applications. But Harvard admissions officers rarely consider the social media pages of applicants during its review process, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said. 
Fitzsimmons said in an interview Monday that while Harvard’s Admissions Office accepts non-traditional application supplements, such as artistic portfolios or music submissions, it takes into account an applicant’s social media profiles on rare occasions and almost exclusively to applicants’ advantage. He did not specify under what circumstances a social media profile may be advantageous to an applicant.
“We don’t do this very often, but we will look occasionally if there are situations where we think more information would help,” Fitzsimmons said. “If someone sends us a link of any kind, it doesn’t have to be from some company or some organization, if it seems relevant to making the best possible case for that person’s admission, we will certainly take a look at it.”
His remarks come after a recent spate of national news that focused on the perceived popularity of LinkedIn, Instagram, and other platforms as supplements to prospective students’ college applications, and the recent rise in social media admissions consulting.
One such company is Social Assurity, which offers social media assessments and recommendations for college applicants and professionals regarding their digital profiles. The company also provides advice on profile creation and guides for students applying to colleges with the newly launched Coalition Application.
Social Assurity founder Alan Katzman said he believes social media can help tell a student’s story beyond traditional admissions essays and questions.
“It helps maybe to explain their commitment to an activity, to something they enjoy doing or care deeply about. It’s up to the school certainly whether they’re going to click on the link or not, but I think in the end it’s only going to help that student present themselves,” he said.
Fitzsimmons maintained, however, that the standard method for applying to the College—the CommonApp and Harvard’s supplemental essay question—gives students the necessary space to tell their stories. Fitzsimmons also expressed concern that establishing an expectation of social media submissions would further complicate the already “daunting” admissions process.
“We’re very reluctant to enter a world where there’s an expectation that you would send in many other things whether it’s electronically or otherwise,” he said.
Some admissions experts hold the same view as Fitzsimmons that admissions offices do not place much emphasis on the social media accounts of applicants. Experts also emphasized the infeasibility for many colleges to look at the profiles of the majority of their applicants. Admissions consultants Parke P. Muth and Anna Ivey said that while it is good practice for applicants to edit their public profiles, it is unlikely that admissions officers will actually view their accounts.
“The reality is that admissions officers at colleges that get a lot of applications, Harvard included, they don’t have time to sit there and look at everybody’s social media profile,” Ivey said. “But there’s always a chance that someone will, and because the chance is greater than zero, it’s just better to play it safe.”
Ivey also cautioned applicants to not go outside of the platforms recommended by a specific college when submitting supplement work, such as artistic portfolios or recordings of musical performances, because most colleges detail methods for submitting additional materials.
Still, Katzman said he thinks social media is valuable because it is an inexpensive admissions resource given that most sites offer free accounts.
But social media consulting services themselves can be expensive. A media assessment by Social Assurity costs $125 while the profile curation service can cost from $750 to $1,750 depending on the platform account site. Prospective college students can take a “Social Media Essentials and College Admissions” program for $24.95.
With these costs in mind, Muth and Fitzsimmons said that while these platforms are readily available, there is still the potential that applicants with greater resources can take better advantage of new application methods.
“Often times the new technology whatever it is is more likely to be used by those who are affluent and from schools that offer many advantages rather than the other way around, and so that’s a concern,” Fitzsimmons said.
For now, students can continue to submit any supplemental materials they want, but there is no guarantee that admissions officers will look beyond the traditional applications and the Harvard-specific supplement questions.
The College will announce its first round of admitted students to the Class of 2021 on Dec. 13.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When John Podesta took the stage early Nov. 9, urging supporters not to lose hope in the waning hours of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, Elizabeth Wiener ’17 had a perfect view of the back of his head.
Wiener, along with roughly 100 other campaign staffers, sat onstage behind Podesta at the Jacob K. Javits Center as he declared the election “too close to call.” Republican nominee Donald Trump officially won the presidency a few hours later, delivering his acceptance speech just after 3 a.m.
“We were sort of looking out at the sea of Clinton supporters,” Wiener recalled. “We were all singing, they played ‘Don’t Stop Believing,’ and we all had our arms around each other.”
“Our spirits still weren’t broken at that point,” she added. “The reality didn’t hit for a while.”
Wiener is one of a handful of Harvard students who took time off from school to work for Clinton’s campaign. In light of Trump’s unexpected victory, Wiener—along with former Clinton staffers Maximilian Frank ’18-’19 and Sarafina J. Chitika ’17-’18—said they have readjusted their plans for the future.
The Harvard undergraduate body overwhelmingly supported Clinton in the election. In a Crimson survey released last month, 87 percent of respondents indicated they would vote for the Democratic presidential nominee. After Trump’s unexpected victory, many on campus said they were shocked and saddened by the election’s conclusion
Chitika, who spent the past semester at Clinton’s Brooklyn campaign headquarters with Wiener, said she wants to take a break from political work for the immediate future. Though she intended to come back to school either way, Chitika said the election results “definitely changed” her post-graduate plans—she no longer wants to work on other campaigns in the next few years.
“I just realized that I don’t think I can be one of those people, especially after the results of this election,” she said. “It was heartbreaking, [and] just so exhausting.”
Chitika said she still aspires to work in politics later in her career.
Wiener, who will graduate from Harvard in May, said she had considered moving to Washington to work in Clinton’s administration next year, if offered a job. But after the election, she said she feels unsure of what job she would take in a “definitely different political landscape.”
Nonetheless, Wiener said she still wants to pursue a career in public service. In the interim, she applied to graduate schools, and is now waiting to hear back.
“In some ways I have this time right now, this next month to really think about where I can best use my talents in the future,” Wiener said. “How I can still help people, specifically if there are communities that potentially will be threatened by a Trump presidency?”
Frank left Harvard last January, midway through his sophomore year, to work as an intern for Clinton’s political team in Brooklyn. In September, he joined her campaign headquarters in Columbus, Ohio as a staff member.
Though Frank said he had a “great time” over the past year, he said he never planned to continue on staff past the election, even before Trump won. Like the others, he will return to campus next semester to resume his studies.
Frank added that many of his campaign colleagues, concerned by Trump’s political agenda, have delayed resuming other jobs in order to help advance “progressive causes.” He said he hopes to do the same—though in a limited capacity, given his academic commitments.
“There are a lot of people... who really want to get involved now and prevent Trump from enacting some of his policies,” he said. “I definitely am looking at working with my coworkers at the campaign to find new ways of organizing people.”
Reflecting on the past year, Wiener said she was glad she worked on Clinton’s campaign, regardless of the result.
“I loved it, I worked with the most incredible people,” she said. “I will never regret it and I will always be proud of it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty percent of undergraduates who voted in this year’s Undergraduate Council presidential election said the College should repeal its proposed sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, according to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
The question was one of three referenda posed on this year’s ballot. Of the 3,042 students who cast ballots this year, 1,820 students voted in favor of repealing the sanctions, 923 students voted against repealing the sanctions, and 299 students abstained. The results of the referenda do not have any binding impact on the College’s policy. 
The sanctions, announced by the College in May, bar students beginning with the Class of 2021 from holding leadership positions in student organizations, becoming varsity athletic captains, and receiving College endorsements for scholarships if they are members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations such as final clubs or Greek organizations. Since its announcement, the policy, spearheaded by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, has been controversial and polarizing.
UC President-elect Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President-elect Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, who were elected last week to lead next year’s Council, publicly opposed the College’s policy during their campaign. In an interview Sunday, Sachee and Khansarinia said they would push to ensure that faculty were aware of the diversity of student opinions on the issue.
“We basically hope to make sure that all student voices as this policy is being fleshed out are being heard,” Sachee said. Sachee is a member of the Bee Club, an all-female final club.
Earlier this semester, current UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 addressed the Faculty Council and spoke at a Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, detailing their support for the College’s policy.
At the FAS meeting, Rather said she believed the sanctions would create “a Harvard College that holds its students to principles of non-discrimination, inclusion, and belonging,” and Banks said the policy could help Harvard “rid itself of… exclusionary vestiges” that he said final clubs and Greek organizations may bring to the College.
Khansarinia said he and Sachee want faculty to receive more student input.
The Faculty “heard a very compelling argument from [Rather] and [Banks] in favor of the sanctions, but there are also a lot of students against the sanctions,” Khansarinia said. “They need to hear what students think on this issue. It's our responsibility to present that to them, and we take that very seriously.”
Separate the FAS meeting earlier this month, in late May, 12 faculty members submitted a motion opposing the College’s sanctions.
This year’s ballot also featured a second referendum on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, asking if the groups should have “gender-inclusive membership by a means different than” the current College policy.
In response to the question, 1,039 students voted in favor of the referendum, 1,176 voted against it, and 827 abstained.
“There was a mass of abstentions because it appears to me and the other members of the commission that the question was really vague,” Estes said. “It just looks to be a poorly worded question.”

As the annual search for summer jobs and internships reaches full swing, Harvard students last week received an email from the Office of Career Services warning against fraudulent job postings on job and internship database Crimson Careers.
The email came after a number Harvard students reported strange requests from companies to which they had applied through Crimson Careers. In this instance, OCS discovered that two “fraudulent companies”—posing as Account Tech and Plein Realtor—attempted to scam money and information from students.
The first incident occurred after Columbus Day weekend, when the fraudulent job posting originally appeared on Crimson Careers. According to Director of OCS Robin Mount, 42 Harvard students viewed the posting, and at least one College student applied.
“They sent her back a check, a bank check, and asked her to deposit it in her own account, and then send the cash to Manila in Philippines,” Mount said.
The student contacted her freshman dean, Michael C. Ranen, who reported the incident to OCS. Another student affected by the second fraudulent posting contacted the Harvard University Police Department.
Deborah Carroll, associate director of employer relations and operations at OCS, said these companies presented their requests for money as a “test” for the job.
“They say something like, to do this job, you need to be able to follow directions and to do multi-step processes,” Carroll said. “For us to see whether or not you’re able to do it, we’re going to Fedex you this check, you’re going to deposit it into your account, and then you send the money to the other person, and then we’ll see if you are able to handle these kinds of transactions.”
Although OCS staff members review Crimson Careers for suspicious activity, fraudulent job postings can be difficult to spot, according to Carroll.
“There’s nothing overtly wrong with the posting until later communications when they tell you they’re going to send you a check, and that’s when it starts,” Carroll said.
Harvard was not the only university targeted by these fraudulent companies.
“One hundred universities were impacted by the same scheme,” Carroll said. Some of the job postings that appear on Crimson Careers come from a platform called Simplicity, which many colleges and employers subscribe to for recruiting.
Although OCS listed in the recent email a number of “red flags” to look for when using the Crimson Careers database—most of which involve providing money or credit card and other personal information to companies—both Mount and Carroll agree precaution and common sense are the best way students can avoid fraudulent job postings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 23, 2016, at 12:20 a.m.
A handful of University affiliates have reported incidents of harassment around Harvard’s campus, echoing a nationwide uptick in hate speech after Donald Trump’s election.
Trump’s victory has sparked fear and outrage across Harvard’s campus, particularly among students of color who say they feel targeted by Trump’s incendiary rhetoric. Several undocumented students have expressed concern about their futures and families because of Trump’s policy proposals that include deporting people en masse and barring immigrants from entering the United States. 
According to Romance Languages and Literatures Department Chair Mariano Siskind, two teaching fellows were verbally harassed on the basis of their immigration status in Harvard Square last Tuesday. Later that night, a faculty member was attacked with hot coffee and racial slurs near the Harvard Art Museums, Siskind said.
Siskind reported the latter incident to administrators that night. According to Siskind, Harvard’s General Counsel Robert W. Iuliano put the faculty member in contact with the Harvard University Police Department to “discuss any continuing concerns and explore available law enforcement options.”
“There’s just no training for situations like this,” Siskind said. “We are pretty shaken, and we are still trying to figure out what comes next.”
Siskind and two other professors in the department authored an editorial in The Crimson describing instances of racist harassment against faculty and teaching staff. In the editorial, they decried “the racist, xenophobic, misogynistic state of affairs sanctioned by the most recent presidential election.”
The Romance Languages and Literatures faculty has been particularly vocal about its support of undocumented immigrants since Trump’s victory. It was one of the first departments to endorse a petition calling for the protection of undocumented students at Harvard. Lorgia H. García Peña, an assistant professor of Romance Languages and Literatures, guided students in Spanish 126: “Performing Latinidad” in organizing a rally for undocumented students on the steps of Widener Library.
“Many of us are immigrants, many of us are being outspoken about our support for undocumented immigrants on campus,” Sergio Delgado, an associate professor and co-author of the editorial, said. “It makes a lot of members of our department vulnerable to these kinds of attacks.”
Hiram J. Ríos Hernandez, a graduate student at the Kennedy School of Government, said he was harassed by a Trump supporter outside the Hong Kong restaurant on Nov. 10, two days after the election. According to Ríos Hernandez, a middle-aged man approached him as he waited for an Uber, saying, “We’re going to make America great again.”
“He said, ‘let me see your papers, get out of my country and go back to Mexico,’” Ríos Hernandez, an American citizen of Puerto Rican descent, said. “He charged at me like he wanted to tackle me.”
Ríos Hernandez was leaving a gathering for the Kennedy School’s Latino Caucus when the alleged attack took place. He had attended a formal event earlier that night, and was dressed in a tuxedo at the time.
“I bawled when I got in the Uber,” Ríos Hernandez said. “I can be in a tux, I can be at Harvard, I can be at the beacon of democracy and liberalism and still have this happen to me.”
Wonik Son ’19, an active Crimson editorial executive, said he was verbally harassed by a man in a passing taxi in Boston three days after the election. At a busy intersection, the passenger rolled down his window and shouted obscenities at Son and mocked him for being in a wheelchair.
During his presidential campaign, Trump ridiculed a disabled reporter during a rally in South Carolina. Son said that the president-elect’s actions made such discrimination seem “permissible now, to a different degree than it was before.”
“I’ve always experienced tacit forms of discrimination,” Son said. “But there was something different about this in that it was so blatant and public in nature.”
Last week, University President Drew G. Faust sent an email to students, faculty, and staff about “escalating numbers of cruel and frightening incidents” that have occurred across the country since the election.
On Monday, Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. Riley sent an email encouraging Harvard affiliates to report bias-related incidents and hate crimes to HUPD.
Riley also clarified that HUPD does not inquire about the immigration status of affiliates as the University’s police force is not involved in the enforcement of federal immigration laws.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cornel R. West ’74, who left the University nearly 14 years ago to work at Princeton University, is returning to Harvard.
West, a renowned scholar and political activist, will assume a joint appointment in the Harvard Divinity School and the Department of African and African American studies, several news outlets reported last week. 
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven declined to comment on West’s appointment. West also could not be reached for comment.
“Our friend is coming back in this distinguished posture to resume an appointment like the one he had when he departed,” Chair of the African American Studies department Lawrence Bobo said in an interview with the Boston Globe.
The appointment comes after faculty members at the Divinity School voted last spring to invite West back. After the vote, an offer was extended to West, which Bobo said has been authorized by the Provost of the University.
West will serve as a professor of the “practice of public philosophy’”—a title bestowed upon individuals who have made outstanding contributions in their professional fields. He will likely arrive by June, according to Bobo.
Henry Louis Gates Jr., director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard, also spoke to the New York Times about his excitement regarding West’s return.
“When he came to Harvard in 1994, he energized the department that we were building. His classes were packed with hundreds of students, and I think his classes once again will be packed with hundreds of students,” Gates told the New York Times.
During his time at Harvard, West drew ire for a high-profile spat with then-University president Lawrence H. Summers, specifically regarding the quality of West’s scholarship and the scope of the University's commitment to affirmative action. The dispute contributed to West’s departure of the University in favor of Princeton.
Still, his appointment was reportedly near-unanimous, according to Bobo.
“I’m sure there are some ripples on the water of discontent but the waters of support run very, very deep,” Bobo said. “The expectation is that he will be with us for a very long time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust joined more than 100 college and university presidents in signing a letter in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program protecting undocumented students that President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to discontinue.
The letter, published Monday on Pomona College’s website, extols the benefits of DACA for students and higher education institutions. While it does not specifically refer to Trump by name, the letter calls on “our country’s leaders” to uphold and expand DACA, and offers to meet with them to persuade them to do so. 
“This is both a moral imperative and a national necessity,” the letter reads. “America needs talent – and these students, who have been raised and educated in the United States, are already part of our national community. They represent what is best about America, and as scholars and leaders they are essential to the future.”
President Barack Obama established DACA by executive order in 2012. The program allows eligible undocumented students or high school graduates who immigrated to the United States before their 16th birthday to receive a type of protected legal status for two years. This legal designation, which is eligible for renewal every two years, protects recipients from deportation and allows them to obtain work authorization and a Social Security number.
Trump, who will take office Jan. 20, has pledged to “cancel immediately” Obama’s executive orders, including DACA. Trump ran his campaign on a largely anti-immigrant platform and repeatedly promised throughout his campaign that he would deport undocumented immigrants once he occupies the White House.
Faust has actively come to the defense of undocumented students at Harvard throughout her tenure as University president. In 2009, she voiced her support for the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation introduced to Congress more than a decade ago that, if passed, would provide a pathway to citizenship for qualifying undocumented immigrants. A year later, she intervened in the case of undocumented student Eric Balderas ’13, pressuring immigration authorities to grant Balderas deferred action status. In 2015, she lobbied lawmakers to defend the DACA program against budget cuts.
“At Harvard, DACA has made it possible for talented students to pursue their education, grow their talents, and explore meaningful ways of contributing to our community and economy,” Faust wrote in a 2015 letter to Massachusetts lawmakers.
The college and university presidents who signed the letter this week similarly emphasized the positive contributions DACA recipients have made to their schools.
“Since the advent of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, we have seen the critical benefits of this program for our students, and the highly positive impacts on our institutions and communities,” they wrote. “DACA beneficiaries on our campuses have been exemplary student scholars and student leaders, working across campus and in the community.”
Former Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Pena estimated earlier this semester that there are about 40 undocumented students currently enrolled at the College.
In the days following Trump’s election, students circulated a petition calling on administrators to take concrete actions to protect undocumented students, including hiring a new Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion to replace dela Pena. About 200 students gathered at a rally in the Yard last week to support undocumented students and present the petition, which has garnered more than 4,000 signatures, to administrators. In an email to Harvard affiliates Monday evening, Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley told students to report incidents of bias to the police department, adding that HUPD does not inquire into the immigration status of Harvard affiliates.
Faust plans to meet in the near future with politicians about upholding DACA, although a University spokesperson did not specify which politicians.
“President Faust will be meeting with political leaders on this and other issues that are core to the mission of the University in the weeks ahead,” University spokesperson Paul Andrew wrote in a statement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Yale College Jonathan Holloway will step down from his position this summer to serve as Northwestern University’s provost, marking the end of a tumultuous three-year term.
In an email to Yale affiliates, Yale University President Peter Salovey praised Holloway for his years at the school, calling him “a calm and compassionate presence during turbulent times.”
Holloway’s deanship, which began in 2014, overlapped with a period of tense race relations at Yale last fall.
Last November, Holloway was criticized for taking several days to address controversy over a dispute about culturally insensitive Halloween costumes—Erika Christakis, a former Harvard House master and master of Yale’s Silliman College, wrote an email to students who advised against cultural appropriation, accusing them of stifling free speech. After he did respond, Holloway, an African American studies professor and the first African American to serve as the college’s dean, pledged to “do better” in responding to racially-charged incidents on the New Haven campus.
In his message, Salovey also lauded Holloway’s academic work, which focuses on American history after emancipation of slaves, noting that Holloway recently wrote an introduction to W.E.B. Du Bois’s “Souls of Black Folk” that was published by Yale University Press.
“As a scholar of African American studies, history, and American studies, he has contributed richly to the intellectual life of our campus and brought eminence to our faculty,” Salovey wrote.
Holloway began his time at Yale as a Ph.D. student in history, and later served as a master of Calhoun College and chair of Yale’s African American studies department. Holloway also held a fellowship at Harvard’s Hutchins Center for African and African American research.
Holloway succeeded Yale art history professor Mary Miller.
According to the Yale Daily News, Holloway will begin at Northwestern on July 1 of next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard football had won nine straight games against Yale, but it was the Bulldogs who went streaking on Saturday.
Near the end of the third quarter, with the score even at 14, a group of Yale students stood up on the wall separating the field from the stands. Not very noteworthy, except for the fact that the students were completely naked. The tradition, known as the Saybrook Strip, can be traced all the way back to the 1970s.
The game-delaying strip was not the most surprising sight at Harvard Stadium on Saturday, however. Seeing a wave of blue stream onto the field as the clock expired and seeing Harvard players jog back to the locker room was totally unexpected. Cliché time: it kind of felt like an episode of The Twilight Zone.
After Joe Viviano was chased out of the pocket on the game’s final play, it was hard to imagine he would be able to complete a game-saving Hail Mary. The senior quarterback threw up a jump ball between Adam Scott, Anthony Firkser, and Yale’s Jason Alessi. Firkser made a bid for it, but Alessi swooped in to break up the play.
As soon as the ball hit the turf, Yale fans and players alike went berzerk. I can still hear a faint ringing in my ears from the crazed reaction of the Yale radio crew, which was unfortunately seated directly behind me. I guess that’s what happens when nearly a decade of futility comes to a merciful end.
The Bulldogs win was made official after quarterback Kurt Rawlings took a knee on the next play. A quick look at the scoreboard cemented the reality in Harvard fans’ minds. Final score: Yale 21, Harvard 14. Game clock: 00:00.
Harvard students are, on average, infinitely more concerned with finding campus events with free food than whether their team wins a game against its biggest rival. A game with title implications, no less.
However, even the most apathetic Harvardian knew that the Crimson was the heavy favorite on Saturday. To say that Harvard football has been good in the past few decades is possibly the biggest understatement in recorded history.
The Crimson is 163-66 under head coach Tim Murphy. Murphy has won nine Ivy League titles, including three in a row before this year. Against the Bulldogs, Murphy’s teams have gone 17-6.
In conversations throughout Cambridge over the weekend, and in Allston just minutes before kickoff, it was a foregone conclusion that Harvard would triumph over Yale. The only question was by how much.
In a way, this expectation mirrors that of Boston sports fans in general. The only difference is that after a Celtics, Red Sox, or Bruins loss, there are calls for the immediate firing of the manager or coach while laments about the patheticness of these teams pervade social media.
You probably noticed I left the Patriots out of that group. The Patriots have dominated the NFL during my lifetime, but if Bill Belichick and crew ever have an off season, I would not bet against seeing pitchforks and torches outside Gillette Stadium.
For example, the Red Sox improved from 78-84 in 2015 to 93-69 in 2016, but people from Narragansett, Rhode Island to Presque Isle, Maine still declared the Sox’s season an utter, abject failure.
There have even been rumblings around the Celtics’ fan base that head coach and basketball genius Brad Stevens has to be sent packing after a 7-6 start to the 2016-2017 campaign. Come on, really?
Fans of Boston-based sports teams are spoiled. The Celtics have the most championships in NBA history, the Red Sox have won three very recent titles, the Bruins are a historic Original Six team with six Stanley Cup victories, and the Patriots have completely reversed their losing ways of the 20th century. Still, in the eyes of your average Bostonian, it’s just not good enough.
Despite the widely-held opinion that the Bay State is the hub of professional sports, Boston aficionados still cannot help being as insufferable as possible. Sure, all four of the major teams have toiled in mediocrity at various points in their respective histories. But that was then, and this is now.
This “championship or bust” attitude certainly doesn’t help Boston’s image, and it probably explains why so many people would rather see the Patriots lose than see their own team win.
As you can see, the sports scene in Boston is unrecognizable from its counterpart in Harvard Square. Harvard fans were likely disappointed after Yale’s upset win, but for them, life goes on. On the other hand, after the Red Sox bowed out of the American League Division Series to the Cleveland Indians this past season, people were ready to riot in the streets.
Yes, there is a difference between professional and collegiate athletics, but many people follow college football and basketball much more passionately than NFL or NBA fans. Look no further than Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium, with a seating capacity of over 100,000, or the annual hype over March Madness.
In summary: treating a game as a life-or-death situation is probably not going to do wonders for your blood pressure, but it might be better to care about the result a bit more than we unbiased journalists do. Regardless of all my complaining, let’s just be grateful for one thing—at least we don’t go to school in New Haven.

The No. 10 Harvard men’s water polo made program history this weekend by capturing the Northeast Water Polo Conference Championships. The Crimson took down MIT, No. 12 Princeton, and No. 10 Brown in its path to victory.
This year’s team has depth that most of its opponents envy. Veteran staples like senior Noah Harrison and junior co-captain Harry Tafur have blended with freshmen to create a season that will stand out in Harvard record books.
Yet even among the amazing breadth the Crimson has displayed, co-captain Joey Colton stands out the heart and soul of this year’s team.
“He’ll make a good play for us on defense and then go down and make a big goal for us,” Tafur said. “Whatever we need, he can do it and he can do it better than most players in the country. He is a one-of-a-kind player.”
Colton has not only led his team to its best record since 2001, but also has steered been a key to the program’s first ever NCAA berth, which the team obtained after clinching the NWPC this past weekend.
His performance was only one in a chain of dominating play. His season stats boast 34 goals, 72 assists, and 24 steals, which makes him the second-leading point getter for the Crimson.
“As a team we played fantastic, but Joey really led us through the weekend with his play,” Tafur said. “Teammates doing any sport in general, when you see them giving their 110 percent effort and performing at such a great level, it inspires you to do the same. He this weekend just turned on the jets so to speak. He was a facilitator and a scorer.”
The two-time captain’s influence extends to far outside the pool as well.
“He is just one of the most loyal friends I have and he really just cares so deeply about the team and he really takes the reputation of this program to heart,” Tafur said. “As co-captains, he is a great friend and in a way a mentor.”
Harvard posted comfortable wins in the quarterfinal against MIT (14-8) and in the final against Brown (11-7). The tightest matchup came in the semifinals when the Crimson met Princeton again after falling to the Tigers in a heated 11-10 loss at home only two weeks earlier.
In the fourth quarter with Princeton leading by one, Harvard found itself in an all-too-familiar back-and-forth game for the third time this season. Calm, cool, and collected Colton answered the call, tying up the game at 13 with only two minutes left on the clock.
The senior then followed the goal up with another tally with less than a minute left to secure the victory and an NWPC championship appearance, the first in Harvard’s history as a varsity program.
The momentum continued into the championship game against Brown where Colton’s season-high six assists and pair of goals added to a lead that the Bears were never able to catch overcome.
In four seasons in Cambridge, Colton has racked up his fair share of accolades. He was the water polo team’s rookie of the year and led the squad in assists as a freshman. The Garden Grove, Calif. native was on the CWPA All-Northern team for the last two seasons and has led the Crimson in assists in each of his four seasons.
Colton’s performances this weekend, this season, and throughout his Harvard career have placed his team in a position to make even more history in the upcoming NCAA tournament, but he doesn’t see it that way.
“By no means was it me doing anything amazing, it was no individual effort from me. It was a good job by the team playing hard defense,” Colton said. “I was fortunate to be in those positions but give those opportunities to anyone else on the team and I know they would have done just as well… It looks like I came in clutch or whatever way you want to say it but I can’t iterate it enough that it was the team doing their job and playing.”

While Joey Colton took home athlete of the week honors this week after leading men’s water polo to its first NCAA Tournament berth, four other Harvard student-athletes had notable performances for their respective teams, earning this week’s Athlete of the Week runners-up honors.
Courtney Smith (Women’s Cross Country)
This past weekend, the Crimson cross country team competed in the NCAA Cross Country Championships at the Lavern Gibson Championship Course in Terre Haute, Ind. The team earned a 26th place finish thanks in part to junior Courtney Smith, who finished 35th overall with a time of 21:00.9. Harvard’s 26th place is the team’s best result since the 1983 Cross Country Championships, in which the team finished 13th.
Due to her top 40 finish, Smith also became the sixth All-American in Harvard’s history and the first since Lindsey Scherf in 2004.
Justin Bassey (Men’s Basketball)
After opening its season in Shanghai against Stanford, the Harvard men’s basketball team returned to Lavietes Pavilion on Thursday to play its home opener against Fisher College. Freshman wing Justin Bassey, making his debut for the Crimson, scored a team-high 14 points in the team’s 78-51 victory. Bassey also recorded four assists and one rebound.
In addition to Bassey’s efforts, Harvard was helped by a bench attack which scored 51 points in the contest, the second-highest total recorded under Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. While Fisher did threaten on several occasions in the second half, the Falcons were never able to bring the score closer than 20.
Katie Benzan (Women’s Basketball)
On Friday, the Harvard women’s basketball team faced off against Samford at Lavietes Pavilion. In a close game, freshman guard Katie Benzan proved to be the difference, as her career-high 16 points led the Crimson to a 57-52 victory. Benzan did most of her scoring behind the line, as she went four-for-five on three-pointers in the contest.
Late in the game with the Crimson up 55-49, the Bulldogs hit a three to cut the deficit in half. However, on the ensuing inbounds play, Benzan was fouled. The Wellesley, Mass. native coolly sank both free throws with 5.1 seconds remaining to make the score 57-52 and secure the victory for Harvard.
Tyler Moy (Men’s Ice Hockey)
On Friday night, the No. 11/10 Harvard men’s ice hockey team faced off against No. 3/3 Boston College at Bright-Landry Hockey Center in front of a sold-out crowd. In addition to being the higher-ranked team, the Eagles came into the matchup with a 10-game unbeaten streak.
With a trio of power play goals, the Crimson was able to end Boston College’s streak with a 5-2 victory. Senior forward Tyler Moy led the Harvard attack with two goals. Moy’s first goal came in the second period, three minutes after senior co-captain Alexander Kerfoot evened the score at one. Moy’s second goal came in the third period off a power play as he sniped a shot into the top corner of the goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tasked with facing the nation’s best team—not to mention the nation’s best player—in its own building, Ted Donato ’91 hoped he and his guys could make a statement. Not to the world of college hockey—just to themselves.
But when former co-captain Kyle Criscuolo’s overtime shot trickled over the goal line at Agganis Arena, mighty Boston University had fallen, meaning the Harvard men’s hockey team now had everyone's attention. The Crimson’s 3-2 win over the No. 1 Terriers on Nov. 25, 2014 helped Harvard climb its way into the top 10 in both major polls for the first time since 2006.
Since then, the Crimson has become a 'regular' in the national conversation. And tonight, Harvard will return to Agganis Arena for the first time since its signature victory, currently ranked ninth in the country.
Just like in 2014, the Crimson will be an underdog—but this time, only ever so slightly. BU enters the contest two spots ahead of Harvard, holding onto the seventh spot in the polls.
Despite losing three of its top four point-getters from a season ago, a Hockey East first-teamer on the blue line, and its goaltender, the Terriers opened the season as one of the favorites to bring home a national championship. BU received the second-most first-place votes in the season’s first USCHO poll (behind only defending champion North Dakota) and assumed the fourth spot overall.
Coach David Quinn’s squad has slipped a few spots since, having dropped four of its first 11 games, but there’s hardly any reason to panic in Terrier land. Three of BU’s four losses have come on the road against ranked opponents, and more recently, three of the Terriers’ top nine forwards have missed time with injuries. That includes 18-year old freshman Clayton Keller, the seventh overall pick in the 2016 NHL Draft who notched five goals and four assists in his first seven games.
Keller, property of the Arizona Coyotes, has now missed four consecutive contests. Over that stretch, BU has gone 2-2, including a shocking 4-0 loss at home to UConn this past Saturday.
Yet in a loss that appears devastating on paper, the Terriers surprisingly looked sharp. In fact, BU’s top line of Jordan Greenway, Patrick Harper, and associate captain Jakob Forsbacka Karlsson—all drafted underclassmen—generated 16 shots on goal by itself. Pucks just weren’t finding the back of the net.
“If you don’t score and they do, you lose; it’s really that simple,” Quinn said. “But with that being said, over the course of the season, if you do the things I thought we did pretty well tonight consistently, you’re going to have a much better chance to win more games over the long haul. And that’s what it’s about.”
While Quinn generally was happy with the way his guys played in the loss, he was even happier with the fact that his Terriers would have a chance to turn things around so quickly.
“Our schedule’s doing us a favor because we don’t have to live with this very long,” Quinn said. “The good news is we get to get back at it and move past this. I want it to sting, but not sting to the point where it’s going to get in the way of us preparing for Tuesday night against a very good Harvard team.”
Quinn has already revealed that he’ll make at least one change tonight. After freshman goaltender Jake Oettinger—who has started 10 of 11 games for BU—surrendered four goals on 20 shots Saturday night, junior Connor LaCouvee will get the start against the Crimson, according to The Daily Free Press.
Lacouvee made his first start of the season Friday in the first game of a home-and-home with the Huskies, and he made 28 saves in a 2-1 road win. As a sophomore, his numbers were below average—indicated by a .897 save percentage and a 2.92 goals against average—but he did put together a 8-4-4 record in 19 appearances.
A back-up netminder paired with a handful of Terrier injuries appear to bode well on paper for Harvard, who is coming off its biggest win of the season Friday night—a 5-2 victory over No. 3 Boston College.
Ignoring its inevitable results against Arizona State, the Crimson had its best special teams performance of the season in the win, finishing 3-for-7 on the power play and 6-for-7 on the kill. The penalty kill will have a chance to keep rolling against a BU man advantage that is ranked 45th out of 60 Division I teams, converting at less than a 14 percent clip. The Terrier kill, on the other hand, currently is one of the top 10 units in the nation, thwarting over 90 percent of its opponents’ man-up opportunities.
A win for Harvard would be its first over BU since that 2014 matchup at Agganis. The Crimson has lost two heartbreakers to the Terriers since—a double-overtime Beanpot classic in 2015 that featured over 100 shots on goal and a battle at the Bright back in January that saw Harvard blow a 5-3 lead in the final four minutes of regulation.
These recent results provide all the more reason why the words of Donato back in January continue to hold up 10 months later.
“I think our guys will be excited,” Donato said. “I don’t think we have to give a lot of speeches to get up for playing against BU. Our guys enjoy that.”
