After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“We are large. We are cosmic. We are universal. We will not be made small,” Kier W. Zimmerman ’19, an inactive Crimson news editor, writes about women, particularly those interested in STEM, in her director’s note for “The Little Years.” Fittingly located in the Science Center’s SciBox, “The Little Years” focused on the obstacles women face when they pursue science. The stage transitions and lights were particularly instrumental to their production of the show and clearly demonstrated the passage of time, allowing the theme of gender discrimination to shine in a thought-provoking play.
The play centers around science prodigy Kate (Celia Kennedy ’20) and follows her through the majority of her life. Kate, brilliant and obsessed with understanding time, lives in the shadow of her older brother, a poetic genius. In the opening scene, 14-year-old Kate is harassed by her schoolmates. She starts to lose interest in school, let her grades slide, and talk back to teachers. Soon after, her chauvinist principal informs her mother that she must transfer from high school to vocational school.
“The Little Years” travelled through several years in the span of a two-hour show, and the team’s use of the stage was natural and professional. The audience remained standing for the majority of the play and moved around the room as scenes changed location. The room was large enough that four main areas of the stage could plausibly represent different locations or times and allowed for minor set changes while that area was not being used. Although the location of the main action on stage changed frequently during the course of the play, the focus remained clear thanks to well-timed and thought-out lighting designed by Charlie O’Mara ’20. The lighting and transitions between different areas of the stage worked together to allow movement and clarity in the play.
In a play focused on such important themes such as gender discrimination and the role of women in science, the play progressed through history in a way that showcased both improvements over time and shortcomings that still remain. The play begins in the 1950s, and the gender discrimination was downright shocking to the modern viewer. Kate’s school principal (Damian Liu ’20) made the outrageous claim that women cannot do math or science, saying, “Women can’t rotate 3D objects in their brain.” At the very end of the play, some 45 years later, significant progress is made in the treatment of women: Tanya, Kate’s niece, is able to win numerous awards in the sciences.

If you get into this house you will… 
1. Become a Broadway Star.Dunster residents need to look no further than their house to kickstart their Broadway career. This video merges excellent singing, dancing, and choreography into a stellar production that is far and away better than the other Housing Day videos. Dunster smartly points to the new renovations for prospective freshmen with Liz Kantor ’18 singing, “All brand new and freshly clean, Dunster’s got that special sheen.” Cleverly changing the lyrics to everyone’s favorite movie musical, “La La Land,” Dunster invites and excites prospective freshmen to join the community.
2. Bust out the marshmallows and sing campfire songs.All future Kirkland inhabitants should receive an unlimited supply of s’mores and lighter fluid to create the perfect campfire where they can sing the “Kirkland Song Song.” This jingle, a parody of SpongeBob SquarePants’ iconic “Campfire Song,” picks up the pace with every line. If this doesn’t scream middle school summer camp, I don’t know what does. The video features a guitar player singing the chorus repeatedly, the Pumba-like mascot up to all kinds of trouble in the dining hall, and students animatedly clapping along to the music.
3. Think that you live with Taylor Swift.Currier residents, keep your eyes—or your ears—peeled for your favorite Currier popstar. That’s right—you are living in the very same building as Taylor Swi—Brynn A. Elliott ’18! I seriously thought that it was Taylor Swift at first singing. Elliott’s voice sounded sweet and yearning, accurately capturing Swift’s sound. She sings, “It’s so small, so you’ll know us all well,” in an attempt to reassure freshmen that the Quad is not the end of the world! 

4. Buy a pantsuit.Eliot hopefuls should look forward to drawing inspiration from their talented upperclassmen and potential housemates. Look no further than “My House,” which features Caroline N. Rakus-Wojciechowski ’18 rapping and rocking a slim-fitting white pantsuit. “Welcome to my house, all the freshmen know now, this can be your home, wow, you don’t have to go out,” Rakus-Wojciechowski says. Her confidence while singing and dancing makes the video enjoyable to watch.  I also sincerely hope more Eliot residents will pick up on the pantsuit trend. One of the video’s strengths is definitely costume.

5. Channel your inner Regina George and wear a bunny costume.Leverett House dwellers, be prepared to get into house spirit by dressing up as your mascot! In this video, all actors wear bunny ears, the bunny mascot dances along with the students, and everyone eats carrots. In accordance to the theme, students cuddle real bunnies  and Bruno Mars’ song “24K (or Carrot) Magic” is changed to include, “We’re in Leverett gear, bunny ears, ain’t no other house to choose.” Prospective Leverett sophomores should be willing to make every day Halloween and channel their inner bunny. The actors do an impressive job committing to this particular aesthetic.

6. Join a cult.Cabot members, be guarded when attending your next HoCo meeting. Even though most freshmen are already suspicious of all Quad houses, Cabot takes Quad culture to an intense and cult-like level. The dramatic opening starts with a tight shot of the fish mascot and then slowly pulls back, revealing a candlelit meeting filled with shadows and orange hues. The actors all sport serious expressions and speak in a medieval style, as if they’re all a part of a “Game of Thrones” war meeting. One Cabot resident declares, “I don’t care if [the Cabot Cod] only has one fin. He is my king, from this day until his last day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember my first flannel. I stood in front of the dressing room mirror at Charlotte Russe, sizing up the pink and grey fabric swishing around my torso. This is it, I thought. Liberation. Pride. Acceptance. Finally, I could put my queerness on display for the world to see. This was the beginning of a new era in which everyone could take one look at me and know that I’m interested in girls. I could meet other queer women and talk about queer things and shop at queer places. Right?
Well no, not really. My life hasn’t changed drastically since that fateful day two years ago. I haven’t cut my hair short. There are no edgy piercings anywhere on my body, not even on my ears. My footwear of choice is flats, not black combat boots. I guess I’m not very good at being a lesbian. And therein lies the problem.
Even though I know it’s just a stereotype, I can’t shake the association between wearing flannel and gayness. It’s definitely a social construct (there’s nothing inherently gay about flannel), but I feel just a tad bit gayer in it. To me, wearing flannel is not just another article of clothing. It’s about breaking societal norms about sexuality and appearance, but breaking them in a very specific, very lesbian way. By wearing flannel, I embrace a one-dimensional sexuality to defy an equally one-dimensional heteronormative world.
When I internalized the idea that wearing flannel equals lesbian and not wearing flannel equals straight, I subconsciously decided that those were my only two options: lesbian or straight. But my identity is more complicated than that, and I’m questioning whether I fit either of those categories.
So, what’s led me to re-evaluate my relationship with flannel? Well, I like this boy. But, I’m worried he thinks I’m gay. Obviously, the reasonable solution to this is to explain to him that I’m not. And to maybe flirt a little.
But, I’ll admit it. I stopped wearing flannel as soon as I realized I liked him. It’s been weeks, and they’re all hanging up in my closet, untouched. I can’t reconcile my feelings toward him with my perception of flannel. The symbol I once embraced now feels awkward and ill-fitting. Am I actually a lesbian? And if I am, is this the kind of lesbian I want to be? Is this how I want to present myself to the world? Is this me?
Elevating the importance of lesbian stereotypes can minimize the experiences of queer women by placing them in a box. We should celebrate all the ways to be queer. And, we can start by reconstructing the narrative surrounding lesbian stereotypes to create more room for queer people who don’t want to or can’t conform to them. After all, isn’t much of BGLTQ pride centered around being true to yourself even if it falls outside of the norm? Even if you don’t have nose piercings or don’t own any flannel, isn’t your identity just as valid?
It’s also worth noting that flannel is often seen as a lesbian stereotype, which doesn’t leave room for other sexualities. What about people who are bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or polysexual? Why aren't they included in this narrative? Along the same lines, when non-lesbian queer women embrace these stereotypes, they’re often assumed to be lesbians.
On a more personal level, attempting to follow these stereotypes simplifies how I perceive my own identity. I remember thinking that I needed to alter my wardrobe if I wanted to be a “real” queer woman. Essentially, I came out of a closet and was immediately shoved into a box.
Do I wear flannel because I’m queer or because I like it?
Closets are meant to conceal your true identity, and perhaps flannel has become a kind of closet for me.
There was a time when it was good for me to hang so much of my identity on a piece of clothing. Wearing flannel was instrumental in my learning to accept my sexuality in high school, and I’m grateful for that experience. But, I’m at a different stage in my life now. Flannel has served its purpose.
Everyone should have the power to create and express their identities in whatever way they choose. Some wear flannel and are empowered by it, and that's wonderful. But, it's just not for me. I express my identity by reflecting on my values, speaking up on issues I care about, and finding communities for mutual support. The amount of flannel in my closet will play no part in this. And, if I do wear flannel, it’ll be because it matches my outfit, not because I want to make a statement.
I’ve spent too much time chasing the lesbian ideal. Now, it’s time for me to chase my own ideals of love, acceptance, and being true to myself.
(Hint: Reread and replace “flannel” with “sexuality.”)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The rejection of unionization by Harvard graduate students after last November’s election was surprising to many, to say the least. Though the remaining 313 challenged ballots are being resolved at National Labor Relations Board hearings that began on February 22, the union’s chance of winning the election are quite slim, as it would have to gain additional 249 “yes” votes out of unresolved 313 ballots to secure a victory.
The near-certain outcome of the election is an expensive loss to the UAW, which invested a large sum of money in its campaign to organize Harvard graduate students by hiring graduate students on campus and as well as full-time UAW staff members. Understandably, the union wants to exhaust all legal options before accepting the outcome, and hence filed an objection to the election with the NLRB, which could result in a revote. However, after having carefully examined the union’s objection, I believe the election result should stand.
In its brief petition filed with NLRB, the union argues that a revote is warranted because the University failed to provide an accurate list of all eligible voters. The petition notes that the University conceded that 383 students who were not included in the voter list and voted under challenge were in fact eligible members of the proposed bargaining unit and therefore should have been included in the list. It also notes that the preferred names, rather than the official names, of 101 eligible voters were provided on the list, which forced them to vote under challenge.
The petition as a whole, however, fails to provide any convincing, substantial arguments or evidence of how these facts would have precluded a fair election. I argue that if almost all students were aware of the election, received communication from both the union and the University about the potential advantages and disadvantages of having a union, and were well-informed of the fact they could cast ballots under challenge—even if their names did not appear or did not appear correctly on the eligibility list—the union’s objection to the outcome based on errors in the eligibility list would have no merit. So far, this seems to be the case.
Leading up to the election, students were inundated with information regarding the election from both the union and the University, as documented in aletter addressed to the Regional Director of the NLRB’s Boston Office, which was drafted by several students who did not want another election. Students were informed by both the union and the University that they could cast votes under challenge even if their names did not appear correctly on the eligibility list or did not appear at all. Indeed, all ballots cast under challenge due to “preferred” versus “official” names issue have been satisfactorily resolved.
Recently, I reached out to the HGSU-UAW to understand better the basis of their objection. I asked them whether they had a list of documented cases of students who were unable to vote because they were unaware of the election. I also asked whether the union has any evidence of the University intentionally providing an incomplete list in order to bias the election’s outcome. The union was unable to provide any such evidence.
It is important to note that the University has strong disincentive against engaging in activities that would obstruct a fair election. It greatly values its reputation and would not take any risk of tarnishing it by committing an unfair labor practice. Furthermore, given its position, the University would have wanted as many eligible students as possible to have voted since that would diminish the chances of the election outcome being disproportionately affected by a vocal minority.
The truth of the matter is that this election was rushed. The University was given only one week to produce the eligibility list of more than three thousand voters based on a bargaining unit definition that was extremely broad. Despite possessing an extensive internal database of students with a breakdown by departments, the union did not bring up any serious issue of missing voters prior to the election.
Furthermore, it appears that rather than addressing complex questions of who exactly should be eligible to vote, the union opted to have an election as soon as possible, perhaps thinking it would give them a strategic advantage. For example, the union did not address the question of whether the votes of many of the first and second year students should be counted even though they are the ones who would be most affected by the election outcome. The great majority of their ballots were not counted. So much for an organization that touts its commitment to democracy.
Issues that union supporters are concerned about such as mental health, child care, and workload protection are important issues that we community as a whole should continually address. The union lost the election not because of some yet unproven wrongdoing by the University, but because it failed to make a proposal that convinced a majority of graduate students at Harvard. The union should accept the democratic outcome of the election and move on. They can try again next year, hopefully with more sensible, practical approaches to problems that graduate students can all sign on to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the heavy presence of students who come from a handful of elite public and private schools prior to college is undeniable on this campus, feeder schools that annually send multiple students to Harvard are indicative of a much larger issue in the nation’s education system. These schools were created to successfully do what government-funded public schools often cannot: provide a rigorous but supportive academic environment and a well-rounded education to ultimately prepare these students for college, often at elite institutions like Harvard.
Harvard cannot fix the educational disparities that lead to the creation of feeder schools, but it can ensure that the students who attend this University without the privilege or fortune of having come from one can excel here. Feeder schools give students an advantage because they instill a kind of “insider knowledge” about how to navigate academic and social spaces like Harvard. They are familiar with the academic and social culture of the College because often their school is modeled off of what is seen at elite institutions in terms of curriculum, class structure, interactions with faculty, extracurricular activities, and even social groups. They can also look to alumni who have attended these schools before them to explain the “ins and outs” and how to “game the system.” This can make their transition to Harvard and college in general much smoother than their peers.
Without a doubt, Harvard succeeds at making resources available to its students, but the problem lies with equal accessibility. It is not sufficient for the University to just provide the tools for success. Those who do not have the information often learned from attending feeder schools also need to be taught how to utilize these tools. The University should invest in a bridge program for those who would benefit most from such guidance–students who are first-generation, low-income, or come from an under-resourced background. The bridge program should be similar to what has been done at other Ivy League institutions, except it should encompass not only academic development, but also social knowledge.
This cannot just begin and end as students transition into Harvard, but must extend throughout their four years at the College. While the University does offer services to assist students, and after freshman year, upperclassmen do continue to have an advising system, a bridge program is a more centralized method to keep this support targeted and consistent for students at every stage of their time here. More than just investing in its implementation, the bridge program should be an administrative initiative and seen as a priority.
In the endeavor to provide more targeted support along with resources, Harvard should differentiate between communities that are first-generation, low income, or come from an under-resourced background, as well as the overlap between these groups. The administration must recognize that a student may be in need of this type of support even though they may not necessarily be a part of the first-generation community. It is important to meet students at their point of need and ensure all of those different communities are served.

It was April 1, and the joke was most definitely on us.
As I walked home from another late-night shift at The Crimson, I noticed something fishy in the normally silent Sorrento Square: a group of shady characters emerging from the side door of the Lampoon, dragging something up Plympton St. Playing a hunch, I turned on my heels to follow. The motley crew ducked into an alley and then back to their castle. I texted Meg P. Bernhard ’17, who was The Crimson’s Managing Editor at the time and therefore still awake, and told her that I thought they were up to something.
Together, we crept cautiously into the alley and discovered a janitor’s bucket, full of steel chains, rope, and a massive bolt cutter. We knew what these were for. We grabbed the contraband and hustled back to The Crimson’s building as the ‘Poonsters chased us up the road.
We couldn’t wait to tell the rest of the staff how we had heroically saved our sacred chair from another bout of torture by the ‘Poonsters… or so we thought.
Since the 1950s, The Crimson and the Lampoon have fought a war of objects: The Crimson makes infrequent attempts to take the Ibis statue that sits atop the Lampoon’s castle, while the Lampoon crafts seemingly monthly campaigns to steal the president’s chair from The Crimson. The chair, wooden and creaky, sits chained to poles on the second floor of 14 Plympton, a prisoner of its prestige: Crimson presidents have sat in it, as have American presidents—from Franklin D. Roosevelt ’04 to the slightly less deserving Donald Trump.
Crimson presidents tend to have more responsibilities than we can count. Amid the many other tasks that come with running a daily newspaper with a volunteer staff of nearly 500, we live in a near-constant state a paranoia knowing that the Lampoon is probably hatching plans to steal our prized antique.
Each night at around 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., before I left our newsroom, I would make my way around the building, checking that each window was closed and each door was locked. I changed the lock on my office door and equipped The Crimson with a new security system.
But I could not stop the ‘Poonsters, who apparently had little else to do besides stalk outside our building. I once arrived at my locked office early in the morning to find a small blue gift box waiting on my desk. It was filled with literal shit. I came in a couple months later to find photos of The Lampoon’s president taped all over my office and the rest of The Crimson’s building; mirrors, whiteboards, and framed photos were vandalized with a dry-erase marker.
Every Crimson president has a Lampoon story to tell. The rivalry has led to international incidents, kidnappings, and one obstruction of Massachusetts state legislative business. Despite all of the changes and challenges we have faced at The Crimson in the last half-century, one of the few true constants is the prank war. It connects us to our history and to all of the 20-somethings who have worked to make The Crimson better over the years.
In the early hours of that April 1, after confiscating the bucket of break-in equipment, Meg and I retreated to our rooms, giddy with excitement.
Just a few hours later, our self-satisfaction evaporated when I received a phone call from our custodian, Lloyd McKay, who has seen the aftermath of more Lampoon break-ins than anyone. He told me we’d had a few early morning visitors—the chair was gone.
Later that day, the Lampoon’s president told me that the group would be sending its newly acquired Crimson chair into space. I dug out my own piece of Crimson-Lampoon history—a bright yellow-and-purple Lampoon letterman’s jacket—and assembled the Crimson editors for the ultimate nerd rumble. Let’s just say their prank didn’t take off.
The ingenuity shown by the Lampoon’s members in relentless pursuit of The Crimson’s most treasured possession does provide dramatic tension or, more aptly, comic relief. As professional as we try to be at The Crimson, this war reminds us that we are still college students. The rivalry is uniquely, quintessentially, and utterly collegiate.
It was a remarkable honor to sit in The Crimson president’s chair. Yet I still have some unfinished business. It involves a hydraulic cherry picker and an Ibis statue.

If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is where I was on Housing Day, what my lousy entryway was like, and all that “Harvard Admissions blog” kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.
In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place I was happy to be floating. That’s not what Lillian would say, of course. When I’m around her I feel like a prize horse’s ass, the way she talks to me in that phony voice of hers: “How horrible, Holden! Of course you can block with us!” I swear, she should just carry around a broken record or something, because that’s what she sounds like.
Freshman spring I made a rule that I was going to quit screwing around with girls, because deep down that’s as much a waste of my time as the whole blocking thing. Of course, I break that rule all the time, but it’s always crumby. Girls don’t get that I’m busy. They look at my GPA and what I do outside of class and just assume I’m free to shoot the bull for a while. And I know Lillian, hopping around like a yardstick is shoved halfway up her ass, just wants to spend all night necking or something. Why else would she want to block with me? Girls only care about necking.
Lillian met my old buddy Ernie at Horace Mann and they’re still dating. Lillian said she wanted to block with me because that’s what Ernie wanted, but that’s just phony and she knows it. That’s the whole trouble with the whole stupid housing thing. You can’t ever find people who aren’t phonies. They bicker about the goddam group name or something, or want to block with Alexander, just about the biggest bastard that ever lived in the whole crumby history of the world.
No I don’t want to tell you about blocking, but I do want to say a word or two about Alexander Robertson Blair, just about the biggest, crumbiest, dumbest sex maniac I’ve ever seen. He always asks, “Are you alone, kiddo?” at breakfast, always blocking up the whole goddam traffic in the aisle like some goddam car that’s stopped working. It’s so embarrassing. Just because he’s dating my sister he thinks he’s my dad or something. You could tell the people lining up behind him didn’t like him. So help me God, I didn’t like him. Even my sister doesn’t like him and she’s dating him.
I don’t want you to get the idea that I’m a goddam icicle or something. I’d like to block with them if they didn’t have such an attachment to crumby Alexander, and if Lillian wasn’t such a phony. Plus Ernie nearly makes you sick the way he shovels all that Catch of the Day into his goddam mouth. And he always has a lot of pimples.
That’s all I’m going to tell about. I could probably tell you about my house, but I don’t really feel like it. Don’t go anywhere near the crumby housing form at all, is what I have to say. That’s the half-brilliant advice I’ve come up with.

Tucked behind packed bookshelves in the Harvard Book Store sits a refrigerator-sized machine, reminiscent of a laser printer with an Industrial Revolution flair. This mechanical behemoth is Paige M. Gutenborg, the shop’s resident book-making machine.
Paige has been a member of the Harvard Book Store family since 2009. Current owner Jeff Mayersohn retired from a career in technology and purchased the Harvard Book Store in 2008 with his wife Linda Seamonson in fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Nine years ago, a weak economy and the growing popularity of digital content seemed to bode poorly for the future of print books and brick-and-mortar bookstores. Mayersohn, however, reached the “opposite conclusion.”
“I realized that the digitization of content would give us access to enormous inventory... provided we had a way of accessing that content and turning it into a book,” he says.
While in the process of buying the store, Mayersohn searched for a way to turn this vision into a reality. He discovered a machine produced by On Demand Books that fit the bill. On Demand Books, printing a company, manufactures the Espresso Book Machine, a device that prints and binds paperback books in minutes.
Recent developments have given the book machine access to a huge number of titles: Google recently digitized countless books in the public domain, and HarperCollins has made many recent titles available for printing in-store. Paige grants patrons access to many more titles than would be available otherwise, from classics to obscure texts from the early 20th century.
Spencer M. Hawkes, a young, bearded, beanie-clad man, oversees the book machine’s operation as the print-on-demand manager. Over the course of our conversation, he casually navigated what he deemed a “wonky looking” computer interface with ease. After a period of noisy productivity, a slim paperback volume slid out of a chute on the side of the machine. Hawkes is accustomed to this instant literary gratification: Paige prints between 1,000 and 1,200 books a month.
Hawkes has been managing Paige since 2015, and operates the machine deftly. He describes it as “two printers and then a fancy binding machine in the middle... relatively user friendly.” The “user friendly” characterization seems to be at odds with the mechanical jungle underneath the plexiglass of the machine. “If things need fixing, “ Hawkes admits, “then there is some sort of mechanical ability required.”
The ability to fix a machine like Paige is fairly rare, as she is one of only 60 in the world and 31 in the United States. Because most of these machines are owned by university libraries and university bookstores, even fewer on-demand book machines are available for the general public’s use.
Paige prints hundreds of books every week. About 60 percent of those are original, self-published works that are later sold in-store and on the Harvard Book Store’s website. Others are older titles that are now out of print. A shelf adjacent to the book machine labeled “Printed On Paige” displays a selection of these texts.
Of the original works printed by Paige, several have found commercial success within the bookstore. Others have been picked up by traditional publishers after an initial printing at Harvard Book Store. Hawkes insists that success, for the authors who print at Harvard Book Store, is “relative.”
“Some people say, ‘I just want [my book] to be available to the 30 or 40 people I think might buy it,” he says. “And [when] those people come in and buy copies, they’re happy with that.”
Some authors who have found success through traditional publishing also choose to print their work at Harvard Book Store.  Kelly Link, who was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in fiction in 2016, created a collection called “3 Zombie Stories” to be printed on the machine.
Mayersohn says he didn’t anticipate the significant role that self-publishing would have in the book machine’s use, but he has taken it in stride. “Self publishing is not going away, and there’s a lot of amazing content being generated,” Mayersohn says. Still, he holds fast to his original vision.
“What I wanted was to be able to tell the world that no matter what book you want, if you come to the store [and] it’s not on our shelves, we’ll print it for you,” says Mayersohn. Though this dream hasn’t yet been fully realized, Paige continues to help budding authors see their work in print.

Last December, a group of Harvard students, professors, and alumni joined forces to launch the nation’s first student-run youth homeless shelter. But Y2Y had a rocky beginning.
“The reality is that it did not all come together on day one or even day 100,” says Sam G. Greenberg ’14, one of Y2Y’s co-founders. Nearly a year later, though, staffers say Y2Y is running smoothly—partly due to its partnerships with local organizations. The shelter, which operates during the academic year, is even planning to pilot a summer program.
As an undergraduate, Allison E. Torsiglieri ’16 often volunteered at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, another student-run shelter located close to Y2Y. After graduation, she joined Y2Y for a yearlong stint as a Program Fellow. Torsiglieri says her time at both groups has given her a unique perspective on their relationship: Y2Y and HSHS often work together, she says, teaming up to share “best practices” as well as smaller things like “milk.” But Torsiglieri says she thinks Y2Y and HSHS could be better partners.
“There’s still so much room to grow and become even closer in the ways in which our services are parallel,” Torsiglieri says.
In addition to HSHS, Y2Y also works with Bridge Over Troubled Waters, an organization that offers a wide variety of programming for the same 14- to 24-year-old homeless population Y2Y serves. Greenberg says collaborating with groups like these has increased Y2Y’s “impact” on the Cambridge area.
Other partnerships lie closer to home. Y2Y frequently consults with the Guest Leadership Council, a group of former and current Y2Y guests that meets weekly to discuss how to improve the shelter. Greenberg says Y2Y staffers have a different name for the body: the “Jedi” council.
But Y2Y is always looking for more groups to partner with, Greenberg says. The shelter plans to debut financial literacy workshops designed by Harvard Business School Students. Y2Y also hopes to work with the Harvard Square Business Association’s Hospitality Committee to bring local chefs to the shelter to hold workshops that will aim to prepare guests for the workforce. Greenberg says Y2Y staffers are also considering implementing digital literacy and computer workshops.
Y2Y’s latest initiative involves keeping its doors open year-round. Rates of risky behaviors—like substance abuse—often spike among the homeless over the summer, Torsiglieri says. She adds there is pressing demand for Y2Y to serve its guests every month of the year. Torsiglieri remembers sobering conversations with past guests who asked, “You’re going to be closed for the next six months? Where are we supposed to go?”
“We can’t pretend that youth aren’t vulnerable in the summer,” Torsiglieri says.
Throughout summer 2016, local organization Youth On Fire commandeered the shelter during the day, offering physical and mental health services to homeless youth in need. But Y2Y’s beds remained empty overnight.
This summer will be different, Greenberg says. Under Y2Y’s new program, the shelter will remain open, and guests will be eligible for either single-night, 30-day, or six-week stays. The six-week option is new to the shelter, Greenberg says, and reflects one of Y2Y staffers’ main goals: strengthening the relationships between staff and guests. Y2Y plans to capitalize on the comparative flexibility of students’ summer schedules to hire between seven and ten full-time staffers.
Torsiglieri emphasizes that many of Y2Y’s proposed programs are still in the planning stages. “These are all hypotheses,” she says.
Not too long ago, Y2Y was a hypothesis, too.

George Parkman first met John Webster around 1810, when they were both students at the Harvard Medical College.
It’s a mild surprise they hadn’t met earlier. As reported by research done by the Public Broadcasting Service, both men came from wealthy Boston families, had fathers who were merchants, and, from an early age, planned to pursue medicine.
Their personalities, however, could not have been more dissimilar. Parkman was tall and reserved, and carried himself with a regal disposition. Despite being a famously hard worker, he also had a warm heart. Fanny Longfellow, the wife of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, once referred to him as “the good-natured Don Quixote.”
Webster was much more of a Sancho Panza. Sociable yet modest, he was well-connected in the world of Boston aristocrats. He was unfortunately cursed with a lack of skill in handling money, which he attributed to his father’s strict regulation of his allowance growing up.
After graduation, their paths diverged. Parkman spent time in France, where he was captivated by the efforts of his fellow doctors to develop more humane mental health facilities. Webster went to Europe, too, and furthered his medical studies in England.
Both men returned to Boston a few years later. Parkman, inspired by his time abroad, attempted to establish a modern metnal hospital in the United States. When the project fell through, he followed in his father’s footsteps and assume control of the family real estate empire. Webster became a chemistry lecturer at his alma mater after attempting to run his own medical practice. Harvard gave him his own personal lab and free reign to pursue medical research. In a way, Webster had everything Parkman ever wanted.
What Parkman did have, though, was money. Though it may not have been his passion, Parkman was a natural in the real estate business and amassed countless properties in the Boston area. Webster and his family barely survived on his meager professor salary. He often raised money by selling tickets to his chemistry lectures.
Webster’s financial difficulties were further compounded by his capricious spending habits. He became known for his impulsive purchases of artifacts, usually financed by loans taken out from friends. The mastodon skeleton he once bought on credit for the sum of $3000 still sits in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology today.
The list of scientific specimens Webster had acquired for the College was exceeded only by that of the people to whom he owed money. One of his many creditors: his old friend Parkman.
On November 23, 1849, Parkman, usually a patient man, was incensed. Upon hearing news that Webster had re-mortgaged a mineral cabinet with another creditor, he left his house and strode angrily over to his old classmate’s lab to collect on his debts.
A colleague of Parkman, Charles Kingsley, had plans to discuss business with the real estate magnate that afternoon.
“His usual hour was half-past two o’clock,” Kingsley later recounted, according to a New York Daily Globe article in 1850. “He was usually very punctual in his arrangements.”
But Parkman was more than late that. He never arrived at all. News of the disappearance reverberated among Boston elites, and newspapers offered a sizable reward for any information on his whereabouts.
No update came until a week later when Ephraim Littlefield, a janitor at the Medical College who worked in the same building as Webster, decided to investigate. On the day of Parkman’s disappearance, he had witnessed a confrontation between the two men, and had felt uneasy ever since.
Littlefield began to search the lab. The door to Webster’s restroom, however, was locked, and the doctor had the sole key. Armed with a tool for chiseling, Littlefield made his way down into the cellar where the restroom resided, and began to dig.
After hours of chiseling, Littlefield finally broke through to the sound of water splashing. He was confroned with a man’s leg and parts of a pelvis. Later, after a search of the furnace room, Littlefield discovered more bones and a set of fake teeth.
These body parts, along with several others, including a vertebrae and a thoracic cavity partially charred by nitric acid, were later identified as Parkman’s. They had been strewn across the lab, dismembered with a certain cold precision that only a doctor of medicine could wield.
Webster eventually confessed that an argument over debts had escalated when Parkman threatened to use his influence to have the professor fired. Webster remembered lunging, striking at Parkman with a wooden stick. After 10 minutes of trying to revive him, he determined his old friend to be “absolutely dead,” as he admitted in his confessional statement. One deft hit to the temple was all it took.
After a 12 day trial, the professor was unanimously convicted.
A friend of his later remarked that Webster, as a younger man living in London, had formed the unsavory habit of attending public executions. These outings were fueled by his morbid fascination with the body. Even the horror of death could not quell his interest in human anatomy.
It came as an ironic turn, if a somewhat fitting one, that he should meet his end at the gallows: Webster was hanged on August 30, 1850.

In November 2000, when most of his classmates were thinking about midterms and the Harvard-Yale game, Jared C. Kushner ’03 quietly bought seven residential buildings in Somerville, Mass. for $9 million,  according to mortgage documents obtained from Middlesex County. Shortly after, Kushner obtained an additional investment property at 11 Dimick St. He was 19 years old.
Kushner, now 36, is best known today for his marriage to Ivanka M. Trump and his role as senior adviser to his father-in-law, President Donald  Trump. While he was a sophomore in Kirkland House, though, Kushner was already somewhat well-known for being the son of billionaire real-estate scion Charles B. Kushner.
Charles Kushner founded Kushner Companies in 1985. Unlike the Trump Organization, which has largely moved from property acquisition into brand management, Kushner Companies remains a real estate firm to this day. Jared Kushner worked for Kushner Companies for years, eventually becoming an owner, before he accepted his current role as senior adviser to the President of the United States.
Although it is difficult to determine the structure of private corporations like Kushner Companies, mortgage documents obtained by The Crimson indicate that Jared Kushner was vice president of 10 corporations as an undergrad, each of which operated as a part of Kushner Companies. Those corporations, centered around Somerville Building Associates, LLC,  all appear to have been centered on the management of the properties in Somerville.
Richard Stadtmauer, Jared Kushner’s uncle and the only other vice president of these corporations listed in publically available documents, was convicted of felony tax fraud in 2009 and sentenced to 38 months in prison. Charles Kushner, listed as president on some deeds, was convicted of making illegal political donations in 2005 and spent 18 months in prison.
Seven of the buildings Kushner operated appeared to be rentals, while a building at 82 Munroe St. was converted into a condominium. Purchased in 2000 for $2.25 million, its 16 units were sold for a combined $4.3 million throughout 2002. The other buildings for which The Crimson was able to obtain financial data returned handsome but less dramatic profits when they were sold in 2004. Those properties—located at 15 Waldo Ave, 81 Summer St., and 8-10 Avon St.—tracked roughly with the city of Somerville, whose property values increased 50 percent between 2000 and 2004.
Previous interviews indicate that, although he was not in charge on paper, Jared Kushner ran the day-to-day business of the Somerville properties. “I’d be in class, and get a call that a toilet broke, and have to get a contractor over there,” Kushner said in a 2006 interview with the New York Sun. Kushner did not respond to requests for comment on this article.
“Everything he did in life, he did at a young age, and with great, great success,” says E. Hirschy Zarchi, the rabbi of Harvard Chabad and a close friend of Kushner during Kushner’s undergraduate years. Zarchi was open in his praise of Kushner, describing him as a hard-working young man who helped build up Harvard Chabad, founded just two years before Kushner arrived on campus. “He was almost like a partner [to Chabad],” says Zarchi. “He was a great friend. At a very young age, he brought a certain wisdom and strategic thinking about building an enterprise.”
Shortly after Somerville Building Associates started bringing in revenue, Kushner donated $18,000 to Chabad. “It’s very, very rare that college students contribute on any level,” says Zarchi, who notes that Kushner’s gift was one of the largest checks ever given to the organization. Nevertheless, Zarchi recalled other aspects of their friendship as far more important: “[Money] was not the defining aspect of our relationship at all.”
Despite his success, Kushner has never been able to escape charges of nepotism. Somerville Building Associates and its sister corporations were funded by venture capital raised from Charles Kushner and some family friends. In 2006, when Jared Kushner bought the New York Observer, a small but influential weekly newspaper in New York City, he did so with profits from his Somerville deals.
By the time Somerville Building Associates disbanded in 2005, it reportedly had returned a profit of over $20 million.

While the supermodels of today look much different from those 10 years ago, there is still significant progress to be made when it comes to diversity and inclusion in the industry. Identities and Eleganza, two of Harvard’s largest student-run fashion showcases, have attempted to challenge the conventional standards of beauty. This year, according to organizers, they’re doing even more.
According to Claudia Laurie ’18, this year’s Identities executive producer and creative director, the show was originally put on in order to celebrate the Asian identity at Harvard. As it evolved over time, the show shifted its focus from highlighting one racial group towards promoting diversity in its various forms.
“Especially with fashion, it’s kind of a complicated issue because it is an industry and an art form where forever there’s only been one vision of beauty,” Tyler J. Frances ’18, Co-Creative Director and Executive Producer, says. “I think that a mission we’re trying to bring to campus is that beauty comes in endless forms, and I think that in the past maybe [Identities] hasn’t portrayed that as enthusiastically as [it] should have.”
As Identities has acquired an increasing presence and popularity on campus, the show has faced some challenges to its mission. According to Laurie, the publicity materials for the auditions last year requested that “ladies” bring high heels. Conscious of the gendered nature of the request, Laurie says the Identities board made intentional changes.
This year, the audition process did not divide auditionees based on gender. In addition, the board distributed questionnaires, asking prospective models to describe their comfort level wearing specific types of clothing, shoes, and makeup.
“We want to specify that people who bring their own personality and their own culture to the audition so that we can see them and hear about them during their interview process,” Li says. “We want it to be much more of a dialogue than an interview.”
Furthermore, Laurie says that with scheduling difficulties, a few of last year’s auditions had to be conducted by only two board members who also happened to be good friends. She says the biases that this could have potentially created, and assured that this year’s process was much more objective, inclusive, and also transparent.
“I think this year we can make it more clear that we’re looking for people with a lot of personal style, attitude, confidence, having fun while walking, etcetera,” Laurie says. “We’re not looking for a body size or a particular look; we have no quotas.”
Eleganza has followed a similar trajectory. Born 23 years ago, the show began in effort to showcase “black fashion and creativity here on campus,” Executive Producer Haylee Smith says. “Eleganza has since then moved away from being just a black fashion show because we want to incorporate everyone on campus.”
According to Smith, all the clothing for the show still comes exclusively from designers of color because these designers “are often pushed aside in the fashion industry.” However, the production involves a racially diverse cast, crew, and executive board.
“Being ‘Identities,’ we want to be inclusive and representative, and also to value and to celebrate all sorts of identities regardless of gender, background, race, interests, and cultures,” Sabrina Li, director of the show’s photo department, says.
The Eleganza team placed a new emphasis on incorporating various forms of dance and music including Korean hip-hop and Caribbean music.
According to Li, Identities and Eleganza plan to co-host a town hall event at the end of March to discuss diversity and inclusion in fashion, both on campus and in the industry as a whole. Identities also hopes to partner with Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, a campus peer support group, to hold an event to discuss body stereotypes.
“[Fashion] is an art form worn and brought to life by the people who are inhabiting it in that moment,” Frances says. “We can present what we think is beautiful about Harvard, and to us that is the community that is so rich and diverse… In that way, we’re really the cutting edge of what fashion could be.”

“Listen, you are at a peak,” warned the headmaster of my high school, just a year ago. “You have reached a high point. From now until graduation you are in complete control. These could very well be the best days of your lives. Make them count, and say thank you to those who matter along the way.”
The following weeks included senior prom, tennis season with a team I had been on for years,  late nights on campus with friends and teachers, Friday night bonfires, and school days that consisted of more time spent outside playing frisbee than spent inside a classroom. It was the time of my life. I was on a high.
Then, after graduation, everything changed. Emotional, vulnerable, and heartbroken, I was scared that my life would never be the same.
Starting college, I trusted my existing relationships, but I knew that they were evolving. No more late-night ice cream runs with my best friend or last minute sleepovers where we’d spend hours in the kitchen talking to her mom. No more Sunday night family dinners or drives to school with my brothers singing to Ed Sheeran. No more cuddle sessions before bed with my little sister. I was scared.
I thought back to when I was 15 years old. The summer of 2013, my last summer at sleepaway camp, was full of giggly all-nighters, days spent by the lake, dance parties, and genuine bliss. When that summer came to a close, I was at a similar low point.
Looking back on it, my post-camp grief seems ridiculous, but it makes sense that I was so sad to leave it behind. Sleepaway camp provided me with a community and a home away from home that I didn’t know I would ever have again. However, I still talk to my camp friends every single day, and our relationships have grown along with us.
Because I’ve been through a transition period before, I am now optimistic that I will eventually find my place at Harvard. Sure, it may be on a different scale than in high school, or at camp, but with time comes experience and, naturally, a sense of belonging.
For the past six months as a freshman, my life has been filled with more highs and lows than ever. The inconsistency of college perpetuates this roller coaster-like sensation.
In three short years, I’ll hopefully be at a high point. I will have to brace myself for another life-changing transition as I prepare to graduate. Without the instability and rapid speed of change, we would never grow as individuals, and we wouldn’t learn from our experiences.
Now, I am over an eighth of the way through college, and I don’t mean to invalidate the emotions that come from these highs and lows. Maybe there will come a point when the change will subside, and my life will feel more stable, or not. But at least for now, the heartbreaks, the tears, and the moments of uncertainty are the only constant. So, while everything is changing rapidly, instead of worrying about the highs and lows, I should just embrace the journey.

All,
Friday was my birthday. There were balloons and party hats and three separate a capella groups to entertain the guests. We had two chocolate strawberry layer cakes and one vanilla caramel sheet cake. There were buckets of chilled old-fashioned coca-cola and sprite bottles and novelty bottle openers to enhance the aesthetic. I even offered Goodbelly Probiotic smoothies as a more health-conscious option.
On top of the specially procured black-and-white checkered table cloth, alongside the eight-foot-tall strawberry milkshake cut-out that complimented the ’50s-retro visual, were dozens of gourmet finger sandwiches complete with toothpicks in the middle and large glass punch bowls filled with freshly tossed salad.
In the middle of the venue stood a photo booth, my own personal 12-dot logo printed proudly across the backdrop. Complete with hundreds of costumes and props, the set-up included an extensive selection of tinted lenses, polka-dot party hats, fake mustaches, and Happy Birthday sunglasses.
I even offered punny party favors, including knee-high athletic socks with my name emblazoned on the ankle.
But no one came.
A few well-intentioned freshmen made appearances, citing the fact that their proctor had hinted there would be free food available in the Quad. Two photographers, one for The Crimson and one paid by an a capella group to capture some candids, wandered around for a while, apathetically snacking on my birthday goodies. My manager, nervously hovering around announcing performances to the empty chairs and couches, also showed up.
Aside from the aforementioned revelers, the celebration was empty. What did I do to deserve so much disdain? Is it too much to ask for the students, who walk by my doors every day, to give one ounce of recognition to the ten years I have spent relegated to the Quad, watching them silently pity my apparent lack of purpose? For once, I thought that maybe, just maybe, these pretentious little busy bodies could take a moment of their precious time to remember that one time they visited me freshman year during orientation week, or the career fair they attended here that rainy Wednesday afternoon.
But no.
You unappreciative twerps can move your meetings and rehearsals to the Science Center for all I care. I quit.

When Crimson Yard representative Arnav Argawal ’20 speaks of Harvard as a “transformative experience,” he isn’t just referencing the Dean of the College Rakesh  Khurana’s refrain. And when he talks about mental health concerns as an “impediment” to that experience, he isn’t just tossing around an overused campaign slogan.
Speaking in Annenberg over the low thunder of the late lunch rush, Argawal insists that mental health is more than just a buzzword.
Recently, Argawal helped organize a Peer Counseling meet-and-greet for freshmen, with representatives present from each of six on-campus peer counseling groups to increase the visibility of mental health resources on campus. He is also planning “We Care Week,” set for mid-April, which will connect peer counseling organizations with University Health Services counseling and mental health services to promote even greater awareness of resources.
Argawal’s interest in student well-being is no surprise given the prominence of mental health in talking points and platforms during the recent UC election cycle.
UC President and Vice President, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18—dubbed Yaz + Cam—highlighted  the importance of increased funding for peer counseling groups during their campaign.
They also outlined an academic duress policy that transfers authority to grant academic extensions from professors to Resident and Faculty Deans.
“We don’t know as a UC the solutions to every problem, we don’t know the solutions to sexual assault or to improving race relations or to mental health and destigmatizing it,” says Khansarinia.
Sachee, on speaker-phone from the UK, chimes in: “One thing we believe is very important is to give support to people we think are experts.”
Sachee and Khansarinia have also continued the Grant for an Open Harvard College.
This $30,000 fund, reserved for student groups, is dedicated to four “compelling interests,” one of which is mental health. The Harvard Student Mental Health Liaisons’ “Stop, Talk and Block” in February received funding from the fund.
More recently, Sachee and Khansarinia have unveiled plans for comp reform. By Fall 2017, as the Class of 2021 arrives on campus, they intend to introduce a review system for comps similar to the Q Guide. Recognizing that extracurricular involvement can be a significant source of stress on Harvard students, they feel that greater transparency in organizations’ comp processes will preserve students’ well-being.
Another item on their mental health agenda is peer counseling. Sachee says that peer counseling groups lack sufficient funds for meals when they arrive for training in early August. She says that the UC intends to provide the necessary funding, in part from the UC budget
Other campaign promises are proving difficult to fulfill.
Argawal’s campaign dream of integrating a peer counselor into every student’s advising network is logistically implausible, as these organizations are overwhelmingly understaffed, he says. Instead, Argawal is looking to incorporate counseling and mental health services contact information into students’ advising portals.
Sachee and Khansarinia are facing similar difficulties in their academic duress policy. “That’s obviously a huge policy that would require a very large administrative change,” Khansarinia says. For now, he and Sachee are focusing on smaller initiatives with shorter timelines.
But mental health remains a priority. “If one’s experience is hampered by continuous mental health problems and concerns, and there are things that we can do to alleviate that and we don’t? That’s unacceptable,” Khansarinia says.

In his memoir, former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Thomas P. “Tip” O’Neill describes a scene from Harvard’s campus during Prohibition.
“On a beautiful June day, as I was going about my daily grind, the class of 1927 gathered in a huge tent to celebrate commencement,” O’Neill wrote. “I could see hundreds of young men standing around in their white linen suits, laughing and talking. They were also drinking champagne, which was illegal in 1927 because of Prohibition.”
As a teenager living in a predominantly Irish, working-class neighborhood of Cambridge, O’Neill was irked by the rule-breaking of these Harvard students. “It was the illegal champagne that really annoyed me. Who the hell do these people think they are that the law means nothing to them?” O’Neill wrote.
“Prohibition” refers to the time between 1920 and 1933, when the 18th Amendment banned the production, transport, and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The amendment was the product of a century-long temperance movement, ultimately brought to a head by World War I: During the war, prohibition advocates claimed that the barley used to make beer could instead be used to make bread for soldiers, and that German brewing companies were enemies of the United States. Sentiment had shifted at Harvard, too: The Crimson published a series of editorials supporting wartime prohibition.The 18th Amendment took effect on January 16, 1920.
But Prohibition failed to prevent alcohol consumption on Harvard’s campus. In fact, the private possession and consumption of these beverages remained legal under the 18th Amendment, so alcohol continued to flow freely behind closed doors at Harvard.
But that wasn’t always the case. The Temperance Society of Harvard College was established in 1859, 61 years prior to Prohibition. The organization encouraged students to adhere to its Total Abstinence Principle by signing the following pledge: ”We hereby solemnly pledge ourselves to abstain from all alcoholic and intoxicating liquors, as a beverage, during our connection with the College.” More than a quarter of students signed.
Eventually, though, the popularity of the Temperance Society––and of temperance––waned. The Society was replaced by the far-less-popular Harvard Prohibition Club, which had only 18 enrolled members as of 1895. Once again, drinking became central to campus culture.
In fact, by 1907, the Harvard administration started to worry about excessive student drinking. Then-University President Charles W. Eliot ascribed the problem to ease of access. “It is possible for students or other residents desiring drinks simply to go to Boston to purchase what they want and bring back with them bottled goods,” Eliot wrote in a letter.
Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that drinking at Harvard continued more or less unabated during Prohibition. In a photograph from 1922, freshmen can be seen with beers at a “smoker,” a name for a party at the time. On Dec. 10, 1925, the Debating Union held an event to discuss whether or not Prohibition was a joke.
Professor of Hygiene Alfred Worcester, Class of 1878, summed up the situation in a 1926 interview with The Crimson. “As far as Harvard is concerned, there has been practically no change either one way or the other as a result of prohibition,” Worcester said. “Students who want to drink can still get liquor almost as easily as they could before, and continue to do it.”
In a university-wide poll conducted by The Crimson in 1930, 74 percent of participating students admitted to drinking alcohol. Only two percent of participating students said they abstained from alcohol for legal reasons.
A few years later, public opinion caught up: On Dec. 5, 1933, Prohibition was repealed. Within weeks, Harvard had applied for licenses to serve beer in the undergraduate houses.

In the 1930s, Harvard’s housing system was changed to mitigate socioeconomic disparities. In the 1970s, men and women started living together on campus for the first time. In the 1990s, the House system saw its biggest change yet—randomization—spurred by complaints that students were self-segregating by race, interests, and personality.
Questions of inclusivity have long catalyzed change in Harvard’s residential system. With growing concerns about social spaces on campus and  frenzies of “blocking stress” sweeping the freshman class each year, administrators are yet again probing the current housing model.
Havard’s “House System” was inaugurated in 1930 under the leadership of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell in an effort to address issues of socioeconomic inequality. Previously, when most of the student body had lived off-campus, class disparities dictated where students resided.
With the generosity of alumni, many of today’s River Houses were born. While the housing system was first established to unify students, women were excluded from these establishments, and an element of selectivity remained. For many years, the Houses operated under the “draft system,” in which House masters interviewed students before admitting them as residents. This system remained until 1970.
The 1970s prompted the second wave of change of the Harvard housing system. Women, for the first time, were welcome to participate in co-ed housing and the “draft system” morphed into what became known as the “preference system,” in which students ranked the houses they liked best.
Under this system, students of similar backgrounds consistently indicated preference for the same Houses, and according to a Harvard Magazine article from 1996, the Houses started to become somewhat homogenous. “One House had a great predominance of natural-science concentrators. Another had most of the gay and lesbian students, and one had an excess of students from prep schools,” John E. Dowling, former master of Leverett House, said in the article. Dowling supported a move to randomization to keep the Houses from becoming dominated by  homogenous groups of students.
Starting with the class of 1999, then-Dean of the College Fred Jewett decided to fully randomize House assignments for rising sophomores.
Not all students were pleased with the change. Some cherished the sense of comfort that came from living with other students of the same socioeconomic, racial or religious background.
“Many minority students, in coming to a predominantly Caucasian school, may feel somewhat alienated,” Jean Tom ’96, then co-chair of the Minority Student Alliance, told Harvard Magazine. “Therefore, the only place they feel they can be fully themselves is in their dorms, where, by self-design, they are surrounded by people of the same race or ethnicity, with whom they share similar backgrounds, experiences, and tastes."
Under the current system, the question isn’t where you live—it’s whom you live with.
This year’s freshmen were told to designate a group of up to eight students to “block” with by 9 a.m. on March 1. Each blocking group is sorted into one of 12 Houses, where its members will live for their remaining three years at the College.
Many freshmen spend months trying to configure their blocking group, starting as early as October.
For some students, the process can be a social nightmare. “When I was thinking about blocking, it would consume a fair share of my thought and effort,” Adam Hirschhorn ’20 said. “We tried to avoid the drama that upperclassmen warned us about, but there was some miscommunication so in the two or three days before the deadline, there was a crunch period.”
Katie Muldoon ’20 said blocking creates pressure to form a single friend group right away. “I think it causes a lot of problems due to the fact that most people don’t know their exact friend group yet only having completed one semester of college,” she said.  Andre J. Senecal ’20 agreed that blocking creates “unnecessary social stress,” calling the system “more of a tradition than a success.”
Thomas A. Dingman, Dean of Freshmen, said “a number of the freshman class” has not submitted blocking forms, although the deadline has passed.
“As we go ahead trying to figure out what is happening, there are a number of situations that are kind of hard to deal with—where people, late in the game, were dropped from a blocking group,” Dingman said.
Last January, the College created a subcommittee to investigate the current problems in the Housing system and identify potential solutions.
Dingman emphasized that he believes there is no “need” to change the current system, although administrators would like to enhance it. “I think we have been exploring ways to enhance students’ feelings of belonging,” Dingman said. “There is also a suggestion that we could deal with some of the blocking stress.”
While the subcommittee discussed changes to House life behind closed doors, the College unveiled historical penalties on members of single-gender social groups in an effort to reconfigure undergraduate social life. Dingman says the two—changes to student social life and changes to student housing—are related.
“There has been a concern that if students aren’t going out to the single gender social organizations, the way it may happen now, that some recentering of the social life is critical and that could happen with the Houses doing more hosting and bringing in the freshmen,” Dingman said. “Maybe this is a way for all freshmen to feel that there is a greater number of opportunities.”
No final decision have been made, but the subcommittee will present its suggestions to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in the spring.
One possible alternative to the current model might resemble Yale’s network of residential colleges. While Harvard students spend the first few months of freshman year eagerly anticipating their House assignment, Yale freshmen arrive in New Haven already knowing their college affiliation.
“There is a magnificent sense of belonging that comes with knowing the college you’re associated with,” Keera Annamaneni, a Yale freshman in Timothy Dwight College, said. “Immediately you know you have a place to call home and you have upperclassmen to turn to.”
Most Yale freshmen live together on “Old Campus,” but are already affiliated with the college in which they will live for the following three years. Although first-years can request to transfer colleges, Dingman said few choose to do so.
Grace Ambrossi, another Yale freshman, said the colleges serve as an inclusive space for students to socialize. “There are so many classes and clubs, so the residential college is just a place for you to hang out, but isn’t a divider,” Ambrossi said.

Last summer, a New Hampshire police officer broke into a hot, parked car to rescue what he thought to be a months-old infant. Even after he smashed the rear window and retrieved the child, Lt. Jason Short did not realize something —at least anything besides the obvious—was amiss. According to WCVB, it wasn’t until after he administered CPR that Short realized the body he was trying to resuscitate had never been alive.
Short had encountered a “reborn”—a hyper-realistic baby doll so named because the original artists who made them would boil older dolls in hot water and strip them of their paint. Once bare, the doll artists would repaint, and thereby “rebirth” the dolls.
Today, most reborns aren’t made by boiling, but the name stuck, in part because it has picked up another valence: The dolls are exceedingly realistic, real enough to look “born.” Each doll takes about twenty hours of work to create, and around thirteen layers of paint. The finished product has delicately mottled skin, the faint outlines of veins, and small specks of moisture at the lips and nostrils. They have fine heads of individually threaded hairs. They are weighted with glass beads so they feel like infants when picked up, and baby powder patches woven into their torsos make them smell like babies, too. In almost every way, reborns resemble real babies.
These dolls are the fascination of a massive international community of doll-makers and collectors. There are clubs for enthusiasts, Etsy-style online retailers, dedicated subreddits, and even a culture of Youtubers who vlog with their reborns.
Among this community are Kathleen Bohmer George and Julie Bohmer Crosier, two  older blonde sisters with explosive laughs, who run the reborn business, Until Forever Nursery, out of their homes in Williamstown, Mass. and Bennington, Vt. respectively.
On a frigid afternoon in January, the sisters are standing in the middle of Main Street in Bennington, worrying about where to find a baby blanket. Usually, watching the Bohmer sisters together is something akin to sitting front row at professional ping-pong: There’s barely time to see one joke land before it’s sent back spinning faster than it came. But at this particular moment, the sisters are sincerely concerned.
The “Uncanny Valley,” a term first coined by robotics professor Masahiro Mori in 1970, refers to the discomfort experienced when encountering human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings. Reborn dolls can veer into that territory if they’re made poorly, but more often than not, what is peculiar about them is that they do cross the valley. They fool us—and it’s precisely this easy believability which is making George and Crosier so anxious.

“We learned early on that with reborns, someone is always watching,” George explains. “No matter where you are.” Babies are attention magnets. People want to look at them, play with them, make faces at them, talk gibberish at them. Because they are so realistic, the same is true of the George and Crosier’s dolls. When the two sisters first took some reborns to a craft fair (they sell a lot of their dolls at festivals and other large public events), a woman approached George and began asking about how they work.
“I held up the doll and this woman asked me, ‘Well, do they move like a baby?’ And I held it up and moved it just like this,” George explains, gesturing her arms in a rough back-and-forth motion. “And this other woman comes shrieking up—she thought I was shaking the baby.” George assured the woman that the reborns were only dolls. Even after the stranger understood, she remained disturbed at the sight of something so life-like being tossed like a shake weight.
After that incident, George and Crosier made a pact to always handle the dolls as if they were real babies. Now, whenever Until Forever Nursery makes a sale, they give the buyer a “birth certificate,” which includes details about the doll—their name, their “date of birth,” and the stipulation that the reborn always be treated like an actual infant.
Back on the cold street in January, the sisters are worried that, without a baby blanket, they won’t be able to take the dolls outside—they would be breaking their own rule. In their free time, George and Crosier often parade the dolls around town. They go to restaurants, cafes or public spaces, usually to “freak people out” and pass out business cards to anyone who seems interested. This afternoon, the two are hoping to hit up a small bar called Madison’s Brewing Company. But the temperature is in the teens, even lower with windchill, and neither of them thought to bring extra cold weather gear.
“They’ll arrest us,” George says with a snicker. Her delivery suggests she’s kidding, but she isn’t. They have had run-ins with the police in the past. The sisters quickly devise a plan. They put off their lunch plans a little and pay a visit to a consignment shop called “Here We Grow.” Twenty minutes later, armed with new blankies and a couple extra onesies, the sisters are sitting at their regular table in Madison’s, dolls cradled in their laps, waiting to see who’ll bite.
George got the sisters into dollmaking—in part out of necessity (a single mother of two at 24, she had once sold dolls to make her house payment), in part because of the kind of obsessive drive which usually makes for excellent reality TV contestants. She is incapable of doing anything half-heartedly, but has charisma that makes it seem charming, not compulsive.
“When the kids were young, we got into breeding pedigreed rabbits,” George explains. “We ended up having 76 of them.” After the rabbits, George bought birds. She incubated eggs in her son’s room, and raised the hatchlings in her daughter’s room—occasionally the kids slept in the den to give the birds some peace.
“Soon, I had 61 birds in our backyard. We had chickens, geese, turkey, quail, pigeons, even emus—they were five and a half feet tall.” They also kept bantam and two African grey parrots with a habit of screeching obsceneties throughout the day. These were expensive hobbies, but George always made them pay off.
“Everything I’ve ever done has made a profit. I never would do anything that didn’t. That’s just how I am,” George says. “I always have to be able to make money.” So when her kids lost interest in their birds, she sold off the stock and turned back to her original money-maker: dolls.
When George returned to doll-making, Crosier followed suit. For several years, they made and sold different kinds of dolls. The business took off, in part because George is an expert. She reads doll blogs, goes to doll auctions (where she’s the first to arrive and last to leave), refurbishes antiques, collects just about every kind on the market (except American Girl, as she is quick to insist) and even several types that have gone out of production.
George had heard of reborns, but it didn’t occur to her to make them until, at her husband’s suggestion, she looked into how much they sell for. George and Crosier’s reborns typically cost a couple hundred dollars, but some (like the one Lt. Jason Short tried to resuscitate) can go for thousands. Usually, the expensive ones are made out of silicone, so they feel fleshy to the touch. Other luxury reborns have mechanical heart beats or artificial respiration. Comparatively, George and Crosier’s dolls are low-tech, but they still sell for nearly five times what regular dolls cost.
When you hear the prices of these dolls, it’s impossible not to wonder who, exactly is buying them. Reborns are not novelty gags you pick up at rest stops, or presents you buy for a niece. They are serious investments. To get one, you have to really want it.
George and Crosier sell and donate many of their dolls to nursing homes for residents with Alzheimer’s—people who may not have much human contact or aren’t well enough to hold a real child without putting it at risk. Occasionally, the sisters encounter customers who can’t or don’t have kids, and buy the dolls in their stead. One couple, who had recently learned they were infertile, sent Julie two pictures of themselves as babies and requested a doll to look like a blend of their faces.
But the vast majority of their customers are mothers, sometimes “empty nesters,” but often young mothers, who buy reborns for their children. If it strikes you as odd that a parent would shell out hundreds on a doll that looks exactly like a child for that child, you’re on the same page as George and Crosier—they don’t buy it.
“What I’ve come to find out,” George says, almost confidentially, “it seems that the kids aren’t even that interested in the dolls. I think that the mothers love them and use the kids as an excuse. That’s why they’re spending all that money.”
Whatever their reasoning, all the demographics share one thing: an intense, nearly parental affection for the reborns. But for every person who loves them, there are as many who find them deeply disgusting.
“No one feels neutral about reborns,” George says, “Everyone has a strong reaction.” These dolls tug at something visceral—some people find the illusion of an infant appealing, others are disturbed by being tricked.
“An infant can evoke the most powerful feelings in anyone, and mostly it’s good,” George says, mulling over the divisiveness of her dolls. “But when something which looks exactly like an infant isn’t—that could also be bad.”
What people often forget about the Uncanny Valley is that it is a valley. It has two sides. On one bank are those things which look like what they claim to be: the toasters, coffeemakers and everyday items people easily accept. Discomfort only arises after an object approximates human-ness and misses the mark. But there’s another side for the indistinguishable things, the ones we take for human. And that’s where some reborns live: almost real, but not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School will allow applicants to submit test scores from the Graduate Record Examination in place of the more traditional LSAT beginning in the fall of 2017, the school announced Wednesday.
The Law School’s decision to include the GRE—a test usually reserved for applicants to non-professional graduate studies—in its admissions process represents a major shift in its admissions criteria. The Arizona University Law School is the only other law school to accept the GRE in addition to the LSAT, which it began doing for the current admissions cycle. The American Bar Association is currently reviewing which exams law schools may accept from applicants.
Still in a pilot stage, the program is part of a broader strategy to encourage a larger population of students to apply to the Law School.
“Harvard Law School is continually working to eliminate barriers as we search for the most talented candidates for law and leadership,” Law School Dean Martha L. Minow said in a press release. “For many students, preparing for and taking both the GRE and the LSAT is unaffordable. All students benefit when we can diversify our community in terms of academic background, country of origin, and financial circumstances.”
The Law School conducted a study in 2016 to determine whether the GRE served as a similar predictor of first-year law student success to the LSAT. The study, which considered the test scores and success of law school students who took both the GRE and LSAT and concluded in early 2017, indicated that the tests equally predicted academic performance at the Law School, according to the press release.
Under current ABA standards, schools may accept another admissions test if they can demonstrate that the alternative is an equal indicator of preparedness.
Many students take the GRE to apply to other types of graduate schools, while only applicants to law schools traditionally take the LSAT. Applicants to the Law School’s Junior Deferral Program—which allows Harvard College students to apply to the Law School as juniors—will be able to apply with the GRE starting with the next application cycle, according to the Law School’s Associate Dean of Admissions, Jessica L. Soban ’02.
“This is about much more than application volume in any one year,” Soban said. “This is about ensuring that top candidates from many disciplines and many geographic locations continue to consider Harvard Law school.”
While the number of applicants to the Law School dropped significantly after the financial recession in 2008, the number of Law School hopefuls increased 5 percent in the 2016 application cycle and 5 percent again in the 2017 application cycle.

As Congress begins formulating a new budget, some professors and researchers at Harvard Medical School are concerned about potential cuts in federal funding.
While Harvard as a whole received almost $600 million from the federal government in 2016, 69.9 percent of that came from the National Institutes of Health, and Medical School professors say that federal research funding is particularly important for their work. Federal funding for research at Harvard has steadily declined since 2009, leading University President Drew G. Faust to cite the NIH as a “major focus of concern” during a visit to Washington D.C. in February.
“NIH’s funds in research grants allow investigators to pursue interesting and novel ideas with a lot of academic freedom and intellectual freedom,” said Medical School and pediatrics professor Kenneth D. Mandl. “It’s a very well-designed system to promote high quality medical research.”
Mandl said while he doesn’t expect any “tectonic shifts” in research funding, he thinks there are certain research agencies such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute “whose very existence may be in question with the new budget.”
“If we see those agencies diminished, we would see less research that’s evaluative of the healthcare system itself,” Mandl said.
Aaron S. Kesselheim ’96, a Medical School professor who studies drug approval and drug development laws, said that the potential decreases in funding, combined with inflation, is “worrying.”
“Unfortunately, it may drive some smart people out of the field and out of academia because there just isn’t as much funding available to go around,” Kesselheim said.
Kesselheim said that most “transformative” drugs that have been approved by the United States in the last 25 years have “had direct origins in publicly funded research.”
“The kind of therapeutic innovation that is most likely to move the needle clinically comes from these publicly funded origins,” Kesselheim said.
Mandl also noted that in the past two years, requirements for receiving NIH funding have also increased, resulting in a more competitive process for grant-seekers and a “push for diversification” of funding sources. He said he expects that trend to continue in the future.
John N. Campbell, a researcher at the Medical School, said that potential budget cuts made him “nervous.”  Last year, Campbell catalogued 50 distinct brain cell types associated with appetite using a “relatively expensive” technique called gene expression profiling.
“Funding is a worthwhile investment because we learn things we can’t find out in any other way,” Campbell said. “The progress being made now in terms of understanding how the brain works will lead to breakthrough after breakthrough for medicine.”
“I think we are all a bit nervous about [potential budget cuts], but we’re staying optimistic and investment in science is always a priority,” Campbell said.
Campbell said that in the event of budget cuts, researchers would most likely seek alternative sources of funding through non-profit organizations. Otherwise, Campbell said, the scope of research projects could be reduced.
Beyond the Medical School, professors across Harvard are worried about cuts in research funding despite a record fiscal year. In February, humanities professors expressed concern about the potential cuts to the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Environmental studies professors also expect to be affected by potential budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency.

University President Drew G. Faust joined Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh at the Ed Portal Wednesday evening to present the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund Awards.
The event, which is in its ninth year, supports nonprofit organizations that provide resources and services to Allston-Brighton residents. This year, thirteen local organizations received grant awards totaling $100,000.
“The thirteen non-profit organizations we recognize and celebrate today don’t just help individuals grow—they help individuals grow into citizens, into neighbors, into a community,” Faust said at the event. “We are proud to welcome them as partners in the effort to bring more opportunities to more people throughout our community.”
The program—which was created by the University and the City of Boston—has given a total of $900,000 in grants to 25 local non-profits.
"The Harvard Allston Partnership Fund is a great example of a public-private partnership that is making a real difference in people's lives," Walsh said, adding that the fund has helped support 4,000 Allston-Brighton residents.
Some of the organizations receiving funds include the Allston Brighton Youth Hockey Association, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay, The Literacy Connection, Boston  Boxing and Fitness, and Oak Square YMCA.
Founded in 2008, the Ed Portal is a community outreach center that provides free mentoring and classes for Allston residents.

Members of the Undergraduate Council met with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana on Tuesday night to discuss the recommended expansion of the College's penalties on members of single-gender social groups.
A committee charged with implementing the policy recommended Monday that members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations be barred from leadership positions on both the UC and The Crimson. While Khurana wrote Monday that he will consider that particular suggestion further, he accepted the vast majority of the committee's recommendations.
The committee also recommended that the Honor Council help enforce the policy—which bars students in single-gender social groups from holding leadership positions on student groups and receiving some post-graduate fellowships. A separate faculty committee could revise or replace the policy by the fall.
In their first public comments on the new suggestions, UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee '18 and UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia '18 said they have “concerns” about the committee’s wide-reaching report. During their campaign for Council leadership, both Sachee, a member of the all-female Bee Club, and Khansarinia said they disapproved of the policy.
“Over the past week we have read and reviewed the USGSO sanctions policy. Like many students we still have concerns about the policy and its lack of specificity in mechanism. We will continue to act on our promise from the fall to engage students in high-level decision making processes from which we have been so often left out,” Sachee and Khansarinia wrote in a statement.
The duo said they intend to work with the faculty committee—led by Khurana and music professor Suzannah Clark—assigned to reevaluate the sanctions policy. At the UC's general meeting on Feb. 26, Khansarinia asked UC members for their thoughts on the committee's proposals.
Members were split on the issue, with some arguing that the UC should be subject to sanctions and others saying administrators should not have a say in who is eligible for UC leadership.
Khurana, Sachee, and Khansarinia all said they look to continue discussing the Council’s role in the policy.
Khurana wrote in an emailed statement that he hopes to work with UC to ensure the policy’s success.
“We have a unique opportunity to create an undergraduate community rooted in inclusion, not exclusion,” he wrote. “Our goal is to co-create a social context in which our shared norms are opening doors, not closing them.
“As a group of student leaders, the Undergraduate Council plays a critical role in shaping and advancing these norms," he added.

UPDATED: March 9, 2017 at 2:39 p.m.
When Harvard students organized a unionization effort, they took an ambitious tack: form one union for all of the University's thousands of eligible graduate students and undergraduate teaching assistants.
As that singular effort, which formally began in 2015, has stalled in the face of vote count delays and now an National Labor Relations Board hearing that could decide its ultimate fate, a parallel effort at Yale has progressed through a more piecemeal approach. Union organizers at Yale instead opted to try and form nine individual departmental unions.
Even as Yale's unionization effort has yielded quicker results—graduate students in six departments there voted to form unions—some organizers at Harvard stand by their broader strategy.
Harvard union organizers explain their decision to try to form one larger union by asserting that students across different departments share similar employment conditions. But Yale organizers argue that individual departmental unions would let Local 33, the union that represents Yale graduate students, effectively serve its members.
[Read here for an in-depth explanation of Harvard's unionization effort] 
“To me, the union experience is based about people coming together and voicing shared concerns,” Felix Owusu, a Harvard union organizer, said. “Those aren’t necessarily things that are going to differ because I study the criminal justice system and another friend studies the environment and another friend does cancer research.”
Owusu said the union would address issues of healthcare, pay, and harassment procedures, and that, from speaking to graduate students across departments, he thinks that they share similar concerns.
“Those are things that I felt that everybody could get behind and it would be kind of ridiculous in my mind if I formed a union to get these things but someone else who is doing the same work—teaching at Harvard university—forms another union,” he said.
Yale, on the other hand, attempted to organize what the NLRB calls “microunits”: smaller, departmental unions within the same company or organization. Yale students were able to unionize in microunits because of a NLRB decision in 2011 that allowed departments of organizations to form separate unions.
Yale graduate student and union organizer Aaron Greenberg said microunits are effective at Yale because students’ needs vary by department.
“Yale is organized into departments and so are graduate teachers,” he wrote in an email. “Voting department by department means that departments that want the union can have it, and those that don't, won't.”
Greenberg said Yale unions will address “issues of race and gender equity, job security, and mental health care” for students.
At Harvard, some graduate students have said that the popularity of unionization varies by discipline, with humanities students more vocally supporting the effort than students in STEM disciplines.
Of the nine Yale departments that held unionization elections, six voted to unionize. The results of the unionization election make Yale the second private university to unionize after August’s NLRB decision legalized graduate student unionization at private universities. Columbia graduate students also voted to form a union in a November election. Like at Harvard, Columbia organizers pursued one larger, unified union.
Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers, said that microunits in certain departments can inspire workers in departments that are not yet unionized to form a collective bargaining unit.
“It wouldn’t be a theoretical conversation, it would be here’s what we’ve done in other departments,” he said.
Although six Yale departments voted to unionize, the fate of Harvard’s election remains unclear. The University and the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers are in the process of presenting evidence about objections filed by both parties to the November unionization election.
If the NLRB agrees with the union’s objections, it could call for a re-vote.
In the hearing, the two parties have also discussed whether challenged ballots— ballots from voters whose eligibility is disputed—should be counted. The remaining unresolved challenged ballots could determine the outcome of the election.
Amidst discussion about Harvard and Yale’s models of unionization, the results of Duke’s unionization effort, which also involved one large union, were inconclusive. Duke union organizers have since withdrawn their petition to unionize. Had they not done so, they, like Harvard, would have attended hearings at the NLRB to resolve challenged ballots and determine the outcome of the election.

Acting Director of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Steven H. Walker extolled the government agency’s innovative capacity and technological abilities on Wednesday at an IOP Forum event hosted by the Belfer Center’s Cyber Security Project.
DARPA is an agency of the Department of Defense charged with developing technologies for America’s military forces. Walker discussed the current goals of DARPA and made the case for working for the agency instead of taking jobs at other technology firms. Michael Sulmeyer, director of the Cyber Security Project, moderated the event.
Walker spoke about artificial projects DARPA is currently developing, such as the Explainable Artificial Intelligence project, and said that the Department of Defense does not allow automated weapons to be lethal.
“We’re very clear in DoD about having lethality, or weapons, under human control, and I’ve never talked to a sailor, airman, soldier, or marine who doesn’t agree with that, that the lethality decision should always be made by a human,” Walker said. “We never want to put the machine in charge.”
Walker also spoke about DARPA's cybersecurity initiatives, pointing to a specific instance in which a program manager posed a challenge to the agency.
"His thought was: could we have machines [hack computers], could we have a machine compete with another machine, and have the best machine compete with human hackers?” Walker said.
Questions from the audience ranged from the broad“What is war?” to the more specific. Responding to o an audience question about how DARPA was adapting to the new presidential administration, Walker said the transition is “going great.”
“We have our heads down doing what we always do,” Walker said. “We get complete support from both sides of the aisle, we’re a very apolitical organization… I think it’s going to remain that way.”
One audience member, Patrick V. Ramirez ‘20, asked about how DARPA attracts top performers when they can get higher paying jobs in the private sector. Walker responded by citing individuals’ desires to serve the country and work on meaningful projects.
“If you come to DARPA it’s all about the mission, and that attracts a lot of people,” Walker said. “They’re willing to take less money to work at place that is that dedicated to getting job done.”
Walker also emphasized DARPA’s role as a stepping stone to other careers in technology.
“You go places after you come to DARPA... Generally people go on to much bigger and better things. Turns out the person in charge of research at Microsoft, Facebook, and Google are all former DARPA [project managers].”

After its recent losses of faculty to MIT and Stanford, Harvard’s Economics department is looking to hire two junior faculty members and increase the diversity of its faculty.
In recent years, well-known Economics faculty like Raj Chetty ’00 and Drew Fudenberg ’78 have left the University, while the department has had trouble attracting replacements. On top of these departures, Economics department chair David I. Laibson ’88 has noticed a troubling lack of diversity in the department. To him, the department has “a lot of work to do.” Harvard currently only has two female Economics professors with tenure.
“Our senior ranks are distressingly homogeneous… that’s obviously something that is of grave concern and something that we’re actively trying to address,” Laibson said.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences at large has also recently pushed for a more diverse faculty body. Dean of Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser said in Feb. that faculty diversity, especially along gender lines, remains “concerning.”
As part of this effort, the Economics department has been working with Psychology professor and faculty development administrator Mahzarin R. Banaji in order to recruit female faculty and faculty of color. For the past two years, she has led seminars with the department about best hiring practices to ensure diversity. Banaji’s academic work focuses on implicit social biases against factors like race, ethnicity, and gender and their role in human decision-making.
Banaji has also held seminars for the Economics department to better identify and hire qualified and diverse candidates. The seminars presented past research on minority hiring, and examined PhD programs at universities to see “what the distribution of the talent looks like.” She added that many people tend to underestimate the number of women with Economics doctorate degrees.
According to Laibson, the Economics department has incorporated information from Banaji’s seminars into their hiring process. The department finalized hiring for junior faculty in February, Laibson said. He said he expects to know a final list of incoming faculty later this month.
The Economics department is also in the process of recruiting Heidi L. Williams, a professor at MIT who previously studied at Harvard. Economics faculty voted on her senior appointment at Harvard in 2016, and is waiting for a decision.
Laibson said he is excited at the prospect of Williams joining the department.
“As a side benefit of gaining this terrific scholar, we’ll also improve our diversity,” Laibson said.

While all of Harvard’s dining halls will shutter during spring break, certain students on high financial aid staying on campus will receive Crimson Cash stipends from the College.
The College has implemented different pilot programs in recent years to provide food for students during the nine-day spring recess. Last year, students on certain levels of financial aid received cash grants to use for food; now, students will only be able use Harvard funds at locations that accept Crimson Cash.
As of Wednesday afternoon, 756 students will receive the $25 Crimson Cash stipend for each day they are on campus this year, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane.
David R. Friedrich, associate dean of students, said the College piloted Crimson Cash grants for the first time during winter recess—before the dining halls were open—in December and January.
“The Dean’s Office, over the last three years, has been piloting different approaches to support students during breaks when the dining halls are closed,” Friedrich said. “[The] goal has been to try and direct this to students who are part of the [Harvard Financial Aid Initiative] and so we look to the Financial Aid office to tell us who is eligible based on that criteria.”
If the College did not originally notify individuals that they were eligible, students could petition their resident dean to participate in the program on an “opt-in” basis, Friedrich said.
“If students who were not eligible based on the criteria we have established have extenuating circumstances, they can work with their resident dean to discuss their situation and we can respond to them,” Friedrich said.
Austin R. Sams ’18-’19, though, said he did not remember seeing an email about the spring break grants until notified by a friend.
“I didn’t receive an email regarding one of the grants. One of my friends happened to mention it and I know she and I are on similar financial aid,” he said. “The main reason I’m staying here over spring break are because flights are expensive going home.”
For many years, the College did not provide any dining options to undergraduates who remained on campus for spring break. A College diversity working group suggested that some dining halls be kept open following similar recommendations the Undergraduate Council passed in 2013 to address the concerns of students on financial assistance.
In 2015, a one-year pilot allowed all undergraduates who stayed on campus to eat in the few open dining halls. Last year, however, the College closed them during spring recess in favor of providing grants to qualifying students based on financial aid calculations. The stipends were electronically transferred to students, allowing them to use the funds anywhere.
Crimson Cash locations in Harvard Square include B. good, Liquiteria, and Qdoba, in addition to CVS and Broadway Marketplace. In contrast to the cash stipend, some students thought that providing Crimson Cash grants could limit food selection. The Square is already considered a “low-access zone” to grocery stores by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which qualifies the area as a “food desert.”
“Qdoba is the only restaurant I can think of that I would regularly spend Crimson Cash,” Matthew J. Holloway ’20, who is receiving the grant, said. “I would prefer it be the stipend in cash.”
Trevor A. Mullin ’17, who also participated in the program last year, said that only being able to spend Crimson Cash limits his options to pricier Square-based establishments.
“I think it does present a problem because usually when I’m faced with a week of feeding myself, I go to Target and choose options where I can be myself,” Mullin said. “Only Crimson Cash is slightly more paternalistic in the options you can take.”
Friedrich said that the Office of Student Life generally encourages Houses and student groups to organize small-scale events during the break to provide free food to students.
‘We don’t want it to turn into a programming time of year, but want opportunities for the community when students may be around campus to get together and have some food,” Friedrich said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Honor Council are weighing how to take on their newly proposed role enforcing the College’s penalties on members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, with some calling the added responsibility unwelcome.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana tasked the body with helping enforce the College’s penalties on Monday when he accepted the majority of recommendations from a wide-ranging report on the social group policy.
Khurana’s decision significantly expands the charge of the Council, which administrators created in the wake of a 2012 cheating scandal to hear cases concerning breaches of academic integrity. Some said they find the body’s new role unsettling.
“Frankly it’s hard enough having the responsibility to adjudicate cases of academic integrity, but expanding that to someone being in a final club just doesn’t fit with why I joined the Honor Council, what I believe it’s about,” said Council member Jake H. Hummer ’17.
Under the College’s policy, undergraduate members of single-gender social groups—starting with the Class of 2021—will be barred from receiving certain fellowships, from holding athletic captaincies, and from leading recognized student organizations.
But the policy may change—a faculty committee created last month will determine the final version of the College’s penalties and consider whether the policy should be “revised or replaced.” Khurana will serve as the co-chair of that committee.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the Council will be responsible for investigating members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations who violate the policy by applying to fellowships. Khurana declined to comment for this article beyond referring to Dane’s statement.
Brett Flehinger, the Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct who heads the Council, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  According to Council member Meg G. Panetta ’17, the council will release a statement on the subject after their next meeting.
“I know we are going to figure out what the implementation means for us, and then we will announce what we were doing,” Panetta said.
Matthew J. Vegari ’17, who served on the Council from 2014 to 2016, said he did not understand why Khurana asked the Council to help enforce the College’s penalties.
“I’m not certain in what respect that relates to the honor code and how it relates back to the principles behind why the Honor Council was created,” Vegari said. “I think it would just be using an existing, established governing body for a purpose that it was not initially created for.”
But Daniel V. Banks ’17, a member of the Council who also helped formulate the recommendations Khurana accepted, took a different view. He argued that the Council has a legitimate responsibility to investigate transgressions of the College’s policy.
“At its very basis what they will be enforcing is lying to the University, which is a breach of the Honor Code at Harvard,” Banks said.  “So while I think the Honor Council itself wasn’t initially conceived to deal with cases such as this one, I do believe that it is under the purview of the honor code, and that institutions themselves change and evolve.”
Multiple students on the Council said they first learned the body will help enforce the social group policy when Khurana sent a College-wide email announcing the move Monday. Several members of the Council also served on the group—known as the implementation committee—that formulated the recommendations Khurana accepted Monday.
“I think when the report was released, it was kind of just unleashing a can of worms,” Vegari said.
Members of the committee that recommended the Council’s involvement in enforcing the social group policy said their suggestions were intended to guide, not dictate, the College’s approach to implementing its penalties. In an interview Monday, implementation committee co-chair Kay K. Shelemay emphasized that Khurana will ultimately decide how to enforce the College’s penalties.
“That’s one way to handle it,” Shelemay said, referring to the proposed involvement of the Council. “We’ve specifically tried not to prescribe, we can only recommend.”
Implementation committee member Timothy D. Haehl ’18 agreed with Shelemay, adding that the committee’s recommendations are far from complete.
“It was something just like talked about, considered—like maybe the Honor Council could be expanded,” Haehl said. “I think there’s still a lot of things that still need to be figured out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Harvard. Yale. The Palestra.
Coach Tommy Amaker has been there before —playing a do-or-die game against the Bulldogs in a playoff scenario. Though this year represents the inaugural Ivy League Tournament, the Crimson’s first round matchup mimics a 2015 playoff scenario where Harvard and the Elis played a one-game playoff in order to determine who would take the league’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
This time around, the scenarios are a little bit different. With Harvard finishing as the second seed in the conference regular season standings and Yale following behind in third, the teams will face off to determine who will play the winner of Princeton (#1 seed) and Penn (#4 seed) in the Ivy Tournament championship and send one team to The Big Dance.
“I’ve been fortunate enough and lucky to experience it through the years in many different ways as a player and as a coach,” Amaker said. “I’m happy for our team and our program to get an opportunity to represent Harvard on the men’s side and see that we can do the best we can, to see if we can play well and win the inaugural tournament would be a really cool thing.”
The Ivy League Tournament is coming at the perfect time for Harvard, as it would have been eliminated from postseason contention by this point in the league’s old format. Though Harvard has benefitted significantly in recent history from the 14 game tournament of the past, the new tournament format gives the team a chance to unseat Princeton, who went undefeated during the conference regular season.
“I guess I am happy that the tournament is in place now because we didn’t really finish out the regular season how we had hoped for,” Chambers said. “[W]e didn’t have the outcome that we wanted in the regular season but we’re attacking this weekend like any other Ivy weekend and that starts with our preparation, we had a good practice yesterday and hopefully we can continue that today.
Despite Amaker and the experience of the senior class in tournament games, postseason college basketball is new territory for most of Harvard’s roster. Only co-captains Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller and fellow senior Zena Edosomwan saw game action in the 2015 playoff at the Palestra, while senior Matt Fraschilla and juniors Chris Egi, Andre Chatfield, and Zach Yoshor were also present but did not play.
Though they are the least experienced in Ivy basketball, the Crimson will need to rely on the firepower of its freshman class in order to make it through Saturday. Newly minted Ivy League Rookie of the Year Bryce Aiken and classmate Seth Towns are Harvard’s two leading scorers, but more importantly they have had some of their best performances in big game scenarios.
Aiken, specifically, has been a key part of both of Harvard’s wins this season, scoring 27 points on the road against the Elis, then responding with 22 more when Yale traveled to Lavietes Pavilion on Feb. 24.
“We’ve needed everything he’s done when we’ve played Yale,” Amaker said. “He’s been a terrific player for us all season and sometimes you can’t expect him to do heroic things all the time and I think at various times he’s been that spectacular for us. But, he’s had a terrific first year and we’re hopeful that he can extend that through this weekend.”
In Yale, Harvard has a familiar opponent. The Crimson swept the Bulldogs 75-67 and 77-64 in two February contests, but Amaker isn’t taking his opponent lightly.
“They’re a very good basketball team and certainly we’ve seen some really good games with Harvard and Yale through the years,” Amaker said. “this year as well has lived up to the billing for both games.”
Amaker noted in a press conference Wednesday that one of the things that makes playoff tournaments exciting is the tendency to provide nail biters and games decided by a single basket. The Crimson has become intimately familiar with the phenomenon of the buzzer beater this season, losing its four Ivy League games by a combined 11 points, with the widest margin coming last weekend against Princeton where Harvard lost by four points.
“Those have been heartbreaking losses,” Chambers said. “Like you said they came down to the last plays and I think, we practice those situations daily. I think when it comes down to that we just really need to focus. Focus on who we are, communication is key, and trusting each other on defense and getting the defensive rebound. We practice that every day and we just have to do it now.”
Yale is coming in hot, sweeping its final weekend of games against Cornell and Columbia in order to clinch the third position in the tournament. The Elis showed they can’t be counted out in any game, overcoming a 14-point deficit to defeat the Lions last Saturday.
Harvard and Yale both have the Ancient Eight’s most recent Ivy bids, with the Crimson last participating in the madness in 2015 and the Elis in 2016. The increased competitiveness amongst the conference teams is one of the motivating factors for shifting to an end-of-season tournament.
“It’s not just exposure for Ivy basketball but all things Ivy,” Amaker said. “We talk about not just what the men and women’s programs are doing but what other sports on our campuses are doing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­While most of its ECAC opponents were competing in the first round of the conference tournament last weekend, the No. 2 Harvard men’s hockey team was enjoying a well-deserved bye week—its first week off since winter break gave the Crimson a four-week hiatus between games.
“I think the challenge is always trying to stay sharp,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We went very hard when we did go, but I think we mixed in plenty of days off...I thought it was well-earned for the guys and we wanted to make sure they were rested and fresh.”
Among the teams in action was Yale (13-13-5, 7-11-4 ECAC), whose 2-0 sweep of Dartmouth earned the Bulldogs a best-of-three series this weekend at the Bright Landry Hockey Center. The two historic rivals will play games 255, 256, and—if needed—257 of their all-time series in what will be their fourth ECAC playoff meeting over the past six seasons.
In its most recent playoff clash with the Bulldogs, the visiting Crimson (22-5-2, 16-4-2) stole a double-overtime victory in Game 3 and bounced then-third seed Yale from the tournament as part of its 2015 ECAC championship run.
“I would put [that Game 3] up there...amongst [my] top most memorable moments,” Donato noted nostalgically. “The length of the series, the closeness of the games, all the emotions that were at stake…. Familiarity breeds contempt, as they say.”
By Sunday night, the teams will know which foe is headed to Lake Placid to vie among the ECAC’s final four for a Whitelaw Cup and an automatic NCAA tournament bid.
This weekend’s matchup was made possible in part by Princeton junior Eric Robinson, who scored a last-second goal with the Tigers on the brink of elimination in Game 2 of their first round series against Colgate. The strike forced overtime, and Princeton, after forcing a third game with an extra-frame winner, seized the deciding contest from the Raiders.
Because the Bulldogs finished behind the other three first-round victors, Princeton included, they head to Cambridge this weekend for a dance with the well-rested Crimson, owners of the top seed in the ECAC tournament for the first time since 1994.
“We tried to find a good balance, I think. We definitely got some rest days,” said co-captain Devin Tringale about the team’s bye week. “But we did put in some good work…. It wasn’t too much of a rest week, but we definitely were smart and are a little bit healthier because of it.”
Harvard has reached the ECAC finals in each of its past two campaigns, emerging victorious over Colgate in 2015, and looks to return to the big stage at Herb Brooks Arena once again. The Crimson owns a 10-4 overall record against the Elis in the tournament and an 8-1 mark when hosting the ECAC playoff matchup. But before this year, Harvard had not beat the Bulldogs during the regular season since 2012.
“In the past, [Yale] has had some really good defense and goaltending,” Tringale reflected. “I think that our strength and our depth allows us to infiltrate that a little more than we have been able to in the past. Having said that...when it’s Harvard-Yale, anything can happen.”
Concluding the campaign with a 10-game winning streak and over a month of unbeaten play, the Crimson finished the regular season with the NCAA’s highest winning percentage at .793 and posted a league-best goal margin of +57.
Harvard’s sheer dominance this season was further underscored when it swept the Ivy League end-of-season awards: sophomore forward Ryan Donato earned the Player of the Year accolade, freshman blue-liner Adam Fox received Rookie of the Year honors, and Donato was recognized as the Ivy League’s premier bench boss.
Co-captain Alexander Kerfoot and junior netminder Merrick Madsen joined in the ceremony of the Crimson’s regular season, as they earned spots alongside Donato and Fox on the All-Ivy first team.
“It’s obviously a huge honor to...have the acknowledgement for having a good year,” Fox said. “That being said...the goal is to have success as a team and obviously win a national championship.”
Harvard and Yale faced off twice in the regular season, with the Crimson nabbing the most recent meeting, 4-2, at the Whale in mid-Feburary. Yale’s 1-1 draw with Harvard three weeks earlier marks the last time the Crimson left its own rink without two points—the only non-win in its past 12 games.
This tie seemed to be the tipping point of the season for Donato’s squad, as Harvard’s current win streak began on the heels of the overtime stalemate. Since then, the Crimson has outperformed its season averages in goals per game, goals against average, average goal margin, penalty kill percentage, and shots allowed per game.
During this five-week window, the Harvard’s 4.8 goals per game ranks best in the nation, and the team remains one of three unbeaten teams since its home matchup against Yale. In the same time frame during the regular season, the Bulldogs underwhelmed at 3-6-1, while their power play slowed to below 17 percent effective. Yale has yet to score a power-play goal this season against the Crimson.
“The first weekend we had after [a bit of a rut] was the Brown-Yale weekend,” remembered Tringale. “We’ve been rolling ever since. Definitely that weekend was one of the turning points in the season and something that we’ve been looking to build on ever since.”
Over the course of the full campaign, the Crimson’s top three scorers, Kerfoot, Donato, and senior forward Tyler Moy, all eclipsed the Bulldogs’ top point-getter, sophomore forward Joe Snively, who finished the regular season with 33. On the flipside, Yale senior John Hayden found the twine 19 times, more than any Crimson skater.
Harvard ended its regular season undefeated at the Bright, an auspicious omen since the superior seed hosts all three games in the ECAC’s quarterfinal series. In order to knock off the top-seeded Crimson, Yale must accomplish something not a single opponent has done all season by winning in Cambridge—not once, but twice.
“We’ve had plenty of this matchup, and I think that it’s always about much more than the records when you play this rivalry.” Donato said. “At this time of year, in order to advance, you have to beat very good hockey teams, and we understand that’s the task for us this weekend.”
As if a heated Ivy League rivalry and the ECAC tournament backdrop do not provide sufficient motivation, February 17’s showdown at Ingalls Rink was laced with post-whistle altercations and physical contact—legal or otherwise—suggesting that this weekend’s series should be intense from the first puck drop to the final horn.

Oscar season might be well past us, but Housing Day is almost here! What better opportunity to pretend to be a film critic? Here are Flyby’s ~totally expert~ takes on this year’s Housing Day cinematic hits and misses.
Dunster - ‘Another Day of Dunster’Whatever your opinion on La La Land is, you have to admit this video is hands-down award-worthy. We think someone needs to show this to Damien S. Chazelle ’07, stat.
4.5 stars for stunning cinemoose-tography and choreography. Can Dunster produce its own musicals now?
Eliot - ‘My House’Flo Rida’s ‘My House’ is a jam, and it’s no less a jam when rewritten for this preppy house. So this is where all of Eliot’s HoCo budget goes… 4 stars for a catchy song, and for being the first house to drop the video. Freshmen will remember that.
Cabot - ‘The Cod in the Quad’
One thing we were not expecting was this Game of Thrones scene. Featuring a line that will become an instant classic, “The Quad remembers,” Cabot’s video is a spot-on parody. Points for the dim, very Thrones lighting. Although you won’t see any Kit Harington-esque hunks here, you will see our very own Dean ‘Kesh!
4 stars for changing the game, and a mention of the phrase “transformative experience.”
Winthrop - ‘Throp It Like It’s Hot’Points for shooting at the actual construction site, and of course, points for a Snoop Dogg song.4 stars for the Disney-rap mashup, and the adorable kid at the end. We don’t know him, but we trust him.
Pfoho - ‘Pfoana’You’ve got to appreciate that Pfoho’s set up their own “Netpflix” where you can watch the current and past Housing Day videos. Pfoho called to all of us with that guinea pig and student ‘Spfa.’4 stars for an adorable take on a modern Disney classic.
Lowell - ‘Chandelier’Great use of that crystal monstrosity. The play on swing housing is pretty genius, since this house goes into its two-year-long renovation next fall.
3.5 stars for originality and that Sia wig-morphsuit combination. It was a little terrifying at first, but it grew on us.
Quincy - ‘Be Our Guest’A song from a movie that’s technically not even out yet? Power move, Quincy, especially combined with the classic Disney costumes. We love that the house also produced a video specially dedicated to its Grille, which includes an ode to SaltBae, mozzarella sticks, and an innumerable amount of dabs.
3.5 stars for a song that will always be a favorite, and the yellow-morphsuited Lumiere who actually sang in a faux French accent.
Mather - ‘No Double’ Mather released its new single… about having lots of singles. Chance would’ve been proud of this mascot with the most spirit—lots of chest-pounding—and a rap that’s actually really long and includes some pretty sick burns.3.5 stars for song choice, and the ability to dance on top of a basketball hoop. That takes skill.
Leverett - ‘24 Carrot Magic’
Unsurprisingly, Lev milks the bunny jokes to no end. We still appreciate the clever rewrite, though: “ears to tail, so player”?
3.5 stars for continuously reminding us of the video’s target audience—“freshman!”—and the adorable bunny cameos #we’reweak.
Adams - ‘Fresh Prince of the Square’Way to bring it with the throwback, Adams! We loved listening to a song that feels as old (but golden) as Adams looks itself.
3 stars for the costumes that made us nostalgic for the 90’s.
Currier - ‘Wildest Dreams’Don’t get us wrong, this is really well-made and beautifully sung. But a simple YouTube search shows that Leverett House did a rewrite of the same T-Swizzle song for their video just last year. We’re not pointing any fingers, but maybe Currier and Lev should sort this out between themselves…3 stars. We’re sorry, but maybe it’s time to take another look at the Honor Code.
Kirkland - ‘Kirkland Song Song’
A Spongebob throwback that was great in theory, but lacking a bit in execution. For the house with supposedly the most spirit, this video didn’t have us feeling too…spirited. 2 stars. Considering they killed Hamilton last year, we had high hopes.
