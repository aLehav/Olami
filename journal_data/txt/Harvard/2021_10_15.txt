After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sixth grade, we were learning about family relationships when my teacher asked an innocuous question, “Will you raise your hand if your parents are divorced?” Out of the 25 or so kids in the class, only two kids raised their hands. I was one of them. The kids from ‘normal’ families looked around the room, attempting to spot the outliers. They zeroed in on me, staring at me with a combination of pity, disgust, and curiosity. I imagined that they were wondering how it felt to grow up as an unfortunate child.
Initially, I felt embarrassed, but as their stares lingered, I felt angry. I was in no way deprived. Despite being a single parent, my dad effectively filled both roles, making any sacrifice necessary to give me all the support and care I needed. But, based on the looks of my sixth-grade peers, I was missing something and that made me pitiful. I needed to show them that my life was not lacking. I decided the best way to prove this was to achieve academically. By achieving just as much, if not more, than kids from nuclear families, I could resist that pitiful stare. I set goals for myself and worked hard in school. I was determined to show my peers that my family circumstances had not set me back, that I did not need to be pitied.
Just a few years later, my dad passed away from health complications.
The loss was devastating and left me a husk of who I once was. And at one of the lowest points in my life, I remember receiving that same type of stare that I experienced in sixth grade. Hearing about my father’s death evoked a belittling, awkward look of pity that inspired shame in me. These looks brought me back to the promise I had made to myself several years previous and the emptiness that gnawed at me was buried by a reinvigorated drive to achieve.
My effort in high school paid off with a great reward; I was admitted to Harvard College. I thought I had finally proven to everyone who doubted and pitied me that they were wrong to do so. It was not until I moved into my freshman dorm that I realized that my approach was deeply flawed.
A week before moving in, my grandmother died. Despite the loss, I still moved away from home. My first few days on campus were incredibly difficult. I had to cope with another loss in a completely new setting. When I explained to peers why I was struggling, I saw a thinly-veiled version of the same look I had received my entire life.
As I sat in my dorm, alone in an unfamiliar place, I realized that I would never escape the stare. I could never prove it wrong no matter how hard I worked. There would always be that terrible moment because loss, no matter the form, inevitably evokes pity. There are no words or successes that can erase loss. And looking at my accomplishments I didn’t feel like I had gained much at all — I felt empty.
This emptiness triggered in me the realization that I had come to Harvard for the wrong reasons. I had fruitlessly tried to use my education to shape others’ impression of me instead of using it to enrich my own life and the lives of others. Remembering my dad, I knew his sacrifices were made for my happiness, not for me to convince others of it. I needed to let go of how others saw me and my circumstances, and had to start living for myself.
Many different motivations lead students to Harvard. Even without loss, the expectations of high academic achievement can make it easy to lose sight of or altogether miss the purpose of a Harvard education. Going through the motions of being a Harvard student to satisfy some external judgment or pressure is not enough. The occasional all-nighter, the paper you pour your heart into, and the problem set that tests your sanity should be done for you.
The emptiness left by loss will always be present, but by prioritizing my happiness throughout my Harvard education, I have begun to understand that piece of myself, unencumbered by the pressure to please others. Regardless of whether you have experienced loss, what motivates you throughout your time at Harvard should be deeply personal. “Do” Harvard for no one else but you.

The paucity of time mandates that we spend it on things that are good in and of themselves. We often hear of the importance of sacrifice. But sacrifice has never meant doing something bad so that a good may later appear; instead, sacrifice can be more accurately defined as doing something which does not appear to be good, but actually is. Though goodness existed from the beginning, it became apparent later.
Such is the case with the study of the humanities. The humanities are the disciplines of the soul. They are immaterial, but not abstract. Philosophy, at its best, is practical and even urgent. We study the humanities because they help us understand what it is to be human. Understanding something fully means also comprehending its “telos.” The true humanist is pushed towards pursuing a more good life because of his studies.
Such intangible studies have no place in the materialist society we inhabit. One who is attentive may be familiar with the three books on Harvard’s seal, collectively bearing the word “Veritas.” All three books are face-up, imploring us to read and seek Veritas through our own endeavor. However, not all three books were always oriented as such. If one were to wander to the Barker Center, Austin Hall, or even the John Harvard Statue, one would find the third book mysteriously overturned, its binding jutting upward. There is a serious implication to this symbolic transition, one embodied best in the man Francis Bacon.
The open books indicate truth as a process able to be harnessed by man. It is therefore scientific. Enough experimentation and logic will achieve full knowledge of the truth, which is effectively equivalent to the dominion laid out by Bacon, who is credited with birthing the scientific method. The closed book suggests that much knowledge may be accessible through reasoning, but admits that truth cannot be fully grasped through physical means alone. Essentially, the contrast between these two symbols is between materialism and idealism.
On the one hand, everything can be understood and mastered because it consists of matter. Understanding the human and the human’s end is not substantively different from understanding gravity and its effects. Both exist in some visible or physical way, and thus are governed by the same laws.
On the other hand, there are notions, ideas, or even substances that cannot be known empirically or even logically. Instead, concepts such as “the good” or “the soul” exist in ways that can interact with us, but are never physically present. We can understand them through contemplation, sentiment, and revelation.
The modern academy is firmly on the side of the materialist. Under this regime, only specific pursuits may be justified. Medicine, for example, seems to be the most virtuous field of study. After all, in the wake of the recent pandemic it is those who research medicine whose advancements have allowed us to save many lives with vaccines. Engineering and computer science are further examples of disciplines that make sense in a materialist framework. They provide us with the ability to make tangible progress, oftentimes aiding doctors, workers, the military, or any number of obviously useful groups. Ultimately, the fields which allow us to achieve the Baconian vision of dominion are easily justifiable. Even those fields which are more theoretical and unapplied such as physics and mathematics are not only methodologically consistent with the materialist regime, but also can help to effectuate its ends through their application.
Of Harvard’s three divisional distribution requirements, clearly Science and Engineering and Applied Science is safe. The Social Sciences are in opposition to the Humanities, and are its materialist alternative. Psychology and cognitive science, aided by the more purely scientific neuroscience, attempt to clarify all mysteries of human action and thought, stomping out room for the soul and thus for the humanist. Political science replaces political philosophy, the modern study of economics as a human-scientific phenomenon replaces the original Greek economics which is an art. Languages are only useful insofar as they can help us profit, which causes scholars of the Classical languages to suffer. The humanities are destroyed by materialism; they have no logical justification.
The first question any concentrator in the humanities is asked is “what are you going to do with that?” as if the study in and of itself were useless. Those in the humanities have struggled to defend it, especially those who subscribe to the materialist paradigm. From this, we are told that humanities help make us critical thinkers, good researchers, or eloquent writers, which are in turn useful towards materialist ends. This attempt being empty, the humanities lose confidence in themselves and begin to try and adopt the sciences because they are “truer.” We are inundated with quantitative history, philological approaches to literature, and professors of philosophy rather than philosophers.
The humanities must be studied for their own sake, not as shells of what they once were, nor as stepping-stones to something “actually important.” The humanities cannot beat the sciences at their own game, and they shouldn’t try. Each discipline has fundamentally different goals. In order for the humanities to recapture importance we must relitigate the question of materialism. Studying the Humanities is fruitful apart from anything else. We just need to realize that again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nobel season is upon us — and with it, a chance to elevate figures that help make our world a better place and, through their selection, to issue a statement on the most important issues and innovations of our time. Despite a regrettable number of ignoble nominations, this year’s Nobel Peace Prize found two deeply worthwhile winners in journalists Maria A. Ressa, a fall 2021 fellow at the Kennedy School, and Dmitry A. Muratov. The pair was recognized for their efforts to “safeguard freedom of expression” in their respective home countries, the Philippines and Russia.
We extend our enthusiastic congratulations to the winners, both for the award and for the brave careers that led to it. Ressa’s (very recent) affiliation with Harvard is a point of pride and excitement for our university; we are deeply lucky to have her with us for the fall. Ressa is a trailblazer, and a brave one at that. After a successful career as CNN’s bureau chief in Manila and Jakarta, she founded Rappler, a digital media company that has covered the Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte’s extrajudicial killings and inspired his ire. Rappler’s investigations have shone a light on the country’s corruption and illiberalism; for her work, Ressa has had the charge of “cyber libel” laid at her feet, as if to underscore its urgency.
Despite only affiliating with our campus recently, Ressa represents, in many ways, everything a Harvard affiliate should be. With last Friday’s award, she became both the only woman to receive a Nobel prize this year and the only Filipino to ever do so for her individual work, a historic first that is also worth celebrating. The members of our own newspaper, as both Harvard students and budding journalists, have a lot to learn from her relentless commitment to bringing the truth to light.
Yet according to the Nobel Committee, the prize is meant to recognize and celebrate more than Ressa and Muratov’s own impressive work. A press release announcing the winners described the laureates as “representatives of all journalists” who strive to protect freedom of information and democracy in an increasingly hostile world, lauding the entire profession.
Honoring journalism in such an explicit manner, going as far as deeming it crucial to the survival of democracy and peace, might seem grandiose. Yet it’s a choice we deeply appreciate. Oslo’s analysis of the vital role of the free press rings particularly true in an era of democratic backsliding and petty authoritarianism. In Ressa’s own words, her award is an explicit acknowledgment that “a world without facts means a world without truth and trust;” a darker, more intolerant world where disinformation and falsified narratives color our perspectives and polarize society — our world, arguably.
Broadly accepted facts represent the backbone of democracy, offering the kind of shared understanding of society upon which healthy, non-delusional political debate is rooted. A healthy, fair, and free press is key to achieving that.
Of course, the pursuit of truth isn’t confined to newsrooms. As a truth-seeking institution with “veritas” for our motto, Harvard has much to learn from this year’s laureates. Our university must reflect on its role in building a set of common, shared facts for the country and the world. As a (perhaps the) preeminent knowledge factory, we must strive to produce and spread scholarship in a manner that allows it to be widely shared and accepted by non-Cantabrigians despite our polarized times.
This Nobel season, Oslo has left us to chew on the importance of a free press, and called attention to the ratcheting threat to democracy and journalists worldwide. Amidst this darkness, Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov shine a light.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company returned 33.6 percent on its investments for the fiscal year ending in June 2021, skyrocketing the value of the University’s endowment to $53.2 billion, the largest sum in its history and an increase of $11.3 billion from the previous fiscal year.
The returns were announced in a note from HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar in the University’s Annual Financial Report published Thursday.
Narvekar wrote in his announcement that public and private equity markets were the main drivers behind the endowment’s “tremendous returns.” The endowment’s public and private equity assets boasted 50 percent and 77 percent returns, respectively.
“Public and private markets both continued their strong performance, which allowed the endowment to not only increase its distribution to the University, but also continue to grow during this critical time when pandemic-related financial pressures challenge all of higher education,” Narvekar wrote.
The endowment distributed just over $2 billion toward the University’s operating budget, which represented 39 percent of Harvard’s annual revenue sources, according to the report. The University ended fiscal year 2021 with a $283 million operational surplus, which included revenue from the endowment.
At the close of the fiscal year 2020, the endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments, and was valued at $41.9 billion.
In late September, experts predicted that Harvard’s endowment could post returns of at least 20 percent, citing the strong market performance as well as record-setting endowment returns at colleges and universities across the country.
In the first days of the pandemic, experts speculated that the coronavirus pandemic could leave Harvard’s endowment in “grave” condition. Their concerns did not materialize.
However, Harvard’s returns have continually lagged behind its peers in the Ivy League, a trend that appeared to continue this past fiscal year. Of the schools that have announced their endowment returns, Dartmouth College reported 47 percent returns while the University of Pennsylvania posted 41 percent returns.
Narvekar acknowledged the “opportunity cost of taking lower risk” in Harvard’s investments compared to the University’s peer schools.
“Over the last decade, HMC has taken lower risk than many of our peers and establishing the right risk tolerance level for the University in the years ahead is an essential stewardship responsibility,” Narvekar wrote.
In 2018, HMC formed a risk tolerance group in order to assess how the endowment could take on more risk while balancing Harvard’s financial positioning and need for budgetary stability. Under Narvekar’s leadership, HMC has dramatically reduced its assets in natural resources, real estate markets, and public equity, while increasing its exposure to hedge funds and private equity.
At the close of his message, Narvekar cautioned that despite the year’s success, Harvard’s endowment should not be expected to gain such strong returns annually.
“There will inevitably be negative years, hence the importance of understanding risk tolerance,” Narvekar wrote. “What is more important is that our team, investment process/analytics, organizational structure, culture, and aligned incentives provide HMC with the framework for long-term success.”
The University’s endowment has drawn scrutiny in recent years for its size and for its ties to the fossil fuel industry, to the prison industrial complex, and to Puerto Rican debt.
Following over a decade of student, faculty and alumni activism, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced in September that Harvard would divest from the fossil fuel industry by allowing its remaining investments in fossil fuels to expire.

Harvard finished the fiscal year ending in June 2021 with a budget surplus of $283 million, despite a $124 million drop in revenue, according to the University’s annual financial report released Thursday. The figure marks a significant reversal from the University’s $10 million deficit at the end of fiscal year 2020.
Officials in June 2020 had estimated that Harvard would face a revenue shortfall of $750 million for fiscal year 2021.
The University cut 8 percent from its operating expenses in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to a decline in large, one-time costs incurred during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in fiscal year 2020. Harvard saved on expenses due to the reduced on-campus presence of students, as well as savings in travel and other campus-related expenses.
Despite these savings, the reduction of students living on-campus caused room and board revenue to fall by 58 percent, and total net student income to decrease by 17 percent, to $888 million.
In the two-year period from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2021, both revenues and expenses declined by five percent, according to the report. It marked the first time Harvard saw ​​two consecutive years of declining revenues since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in the report that Harvard invested more than $143 million in pandemic-related expenses including Covid-19 testing, contact tracing, and compensation for idled employees.
“Facing declining revenues this past fiscal year, we took steps to control spending while developing and adopting new policies, providing frequent testing and robust contact tracing, and reimagining our shared practices and physical spaces to protect our students, faculty, and staff—an investment totaling more than $83 million,” Bacow wrote. “We also continued to pay our idled employees and contract workers at a cost of nearly $60 million.”
These investments helped the University avoid widespread layoffs, according to Bacow, who wrote that “almost all” of these employees had returned to work.
Bacow wrote that the University received an influx of current-use gifts from donors over the past fiscal year, a marked improvement from the 13 percent decline in gift pledges in fiscal year 2020.
“An increase in gifts for current use gave us the opportunity to direct funding to areas with the greatest need, and in ways that have made a real impact as we worked to address and abate the pandemic,” Bacow wrote.
Harvard Management Company CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar announced in a note in the financial report Thursday that the endowment posted 33.6 percent returns on its investments in 2021. The fund now totals $53.2 billion, the largest sum in its history.
Harvard’s endowment distribution increased by 2 percent in light of these immediate-use donations to total 5.2 percent of its market value. The endowment typically pays out roughly 5 percent of its value each year.
Despite the endowment’s success, University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister wrote in the report that the University is limited by structured giving and market uncertainty in how much it spends from the endowment.
“The endowment is sometimes misunderstood as a checkbook for free spending, however that is not how it works, nor how it was intended by the donors whose gifts created the endowment,” Finnegan and Hollister wrote. “We are gratified that this year’s return results will provide a lift to operations in the next few years but remain aware that history teaches that capital markets give and take away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School’s faculty and student body remains overwhelmingly white, according to the school's annual diversity report released Wednesday.
The report — which revealed scant changes across various demographics of the student body, faculty, and staff composition — comes as HKS has introduced efforts to boost diversity and inclusivity at the Kennedy School.
The racial diversity of U.S. students, who comprise 53 percent of the student body, marginally increased compared to last year.
The proportion of students identifying as Black or African American increased slightly, from 8 to 11 percent, while the percentage of students who identify as Latinx dropped by a point, from 13 to 12 percent. The proportion of students identifying as white was almost unchanged, from 54 to 53 percent, and the percentage of students who identify as Asian held steady at 18 percent.
The report does not include the racial breakdown of international students “because race and ethnicity are interpreted differently in different settings around the world.”
The racial makeup of professors also remained constant, with 77 percent of professors identifying as white. The school, however, saw a slight increase in gender diversity among faculty, with the share of female professors growing from 22 to 26 percent.
The percentage increase marks the first change in the tenured faculty gender composition since HKS began releasing demographic reports in 2018.
Total enrollment across the Kennedy School’s four master’s degree programs increased to 1,208 students following last year’s unusually low figure of 915 students. Normally, the Kennedy School enrolls approximately 1,000 students, but students admitted last year were given the option to defer enrollment due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The issue of diversity and inclusion has long been a divisive issue at the Kennedy School. Despite the school's slow progress in diversifying its student body and faculty, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf noted in an emailed statement the report's positive trends.
“While in any complex organization the demographic composition can take longer to diversify than we’d like, the Kennedy School has a clear strategy and specific action plans that have enabled us to move in the right direction,” Elmendorf wrote in the statement. “Our students, staff, and faculty share the goal of making our community more diverse and welcoming.
This past summer, HKS published a website highlighting its strategies to increase diversity and combat racism. Among the efforts listed in its action plan is the appointment of roughly 10 faculty members between 2018 and 2021 “whose work focuses on race and policy.”
Elmendorf wrote the Kennedy School “has instituted new approaches to be more systematic in enhancing diversity and inclusion.”
“Those approaches include additional hiring of faculty in clusters so we can make better use of broad candidate pools, partnering with current students in targeted outreach to potential new students, refining the review of student applications to minimize implicit bias, and revising our financial aid allocation to give more weight to applicants’ need,” Elmendorf wrote in his statement.
He declined to provide a specific time for when these changes would materialize.

Author Ibram X. Kendi and political strategist Heather C. McGhee discussed the history and ongoing threat of racism in America on Thursday at a virtual event hosted by the Kennedy School’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation and the Institute of Politics.
The event — titled “Reckoning with the Past, Rebuilding The Future” — was part of the Ash Center’s Truth and Transformation Conference and was moderated by HKS professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the director of the Institutional Antiracism and Accountability Project at the Ash Center.
McGhee discussed her recent book, “The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together,” which focuses on how racism affects almost everyone.
“If we’re honest about the ways in which the central animating force in the politics that shifted us from the era of prosperity into the inequality era — and that continues to bedevil our progress — is racism, then we have to be honest about the fact that it has a cost for virtually everyone,” she said.
Still, McGhee noted that there are a select few “people who are profiting mightily from selling racist ideas.”
The discussion also touched on the partisan bubbles that most individuals exist in, which create an “us versus them rhetoric,” said McGee.
“The way in which social media, particularly Facebook, has been sort of taken over by the conservative meme factories, it just means that there’s just a totally different universe,” McGhee said.
According to McGhee, these kinds of groups are inaccessible to those working to provide historical context and facts on issues like racism. Kendi added that these bubbles can make it harder for people to understand how they contribute to a racist society.
“I think one of the sticking points that I’ve found is this sort of predominance of white people saying, ‘I'm not racist,’ and the predominance of people of color saying ‘I can’t be racist,’ and it creates this environment in which we have racism, but every individual is claiming that it’s not them,” he said.
Kendi is known for his bestselling book “How To Be An Antiracist,” in which he explains how white and Black people alike uphold racist structures through individual racist actions. He is also a professor at Boston University, where he directs the Center for Antiracist Research.
While discussing the ongoing challenge of racism in the United States, Kendi pointed the finger at those in power, who he argued benefit most from a racist society.
“Those who are trying to — through their policies and power — maintain inequity and justice don’t want to start the conversation,” Kendi said.
He also encouraged individuals to ask tough questions about racism in their daily lives.
“Why is it that Native people are three times more likely to be impoverished than white people?” Kendi asked. “Why is it that Black people have died at twice the rates as white people from Covid-19?
McGhee encouraged attendees to reflect on what it means to be an American in a country built on racist structures and how that affects their daily lives.
“It is hard to hold in your mind and your heart both being an American and the weight and the enormity of the depravity of what this country has done,” she said.

Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott said in an interview Thursday that she believes the NCAA’s recent decision to allow athletes to profit off their name, image, and likeness — which the Ivy League adopted soon after — helps to equalize student athletes and all other students at the College.
The NCAA decided in June that collegiate athletes could profit from their name, image, and likeness, allowing athletes to secure sponsorships for the first time in the league’s history. The NCAA announced the policy after the Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA could not prohibit moderate payments to student athletes.
In lockstep, the Ivy League changed its bylaws to align with the NCAA’s new rule.
By being able to accrue education-related compensation, Harvard athletes now have access to an opportunity that their non-athlete counterparts at the College already had, per McDermott.
“I think it’s only given them access to opportunities that other students have, and I think those that are able to do some things are very much in line with the kinds of opportunities you’ve heard other students maybe have previously, whether it’s local businesses or social media opportunities or just wanting to be entrepreneurial and follow an idea, and they haven’t been able to do that before,” she said.
A number of student athletes have already secured these NIL deals, and more continue to sign deals with local businesses, such as Playa Bowls.
McDermott explained that the mission of Harvard Athletics dovetails with the College’s mission.
“Athletics is very much aligned with the College, and the mission of the College,” she said, citing their shared commitment to cultivating leaders and encouraging students to take risks. “I think there’s a great alignment in this idea that student athletes and students are treated the same and have access to the same kinds of things in their student experiences.”
Though athletes can cash in on their name, image, and likeness for the first time, McDermott said she does not believe the opportunity has distracted athletes or undermined the principles of Harvard Athletics.
“Taking on more by seeking out these opportunities, it doesn’t seem to be where their focus is, or what they’re concerned about,” McDermott said. “I think the ones that are taking advantage of it now are mainly those that already had some following on social media or something that they did that was popular and now they can monetize it, and it was just kind of flipping the switch where they weren’t monetizing it prior and now they’re monetizing it.”
Through conversations, McDermott said coaches have reported no noticeable changes in their student athletes’ performances due to the policy.
“I actually brought this up with our head coaches recently and asked what they’re hearing, any concerns, are they maybe feeling like students are a bit more distracted by this or focused on this, and there was nothing that came up,” McDermott said. “They seem not at all affected by it.”

Barred from attending in-person classes as a condition of their enrollment, many students in a virtual part-time Master’s program launched by the Graduate School of Education last year are advocating for improved online programming and turning to cross-registration for the chance to experience a live classroom.
In response to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, HGSE offered students the option of part-time enrollment — a fully online degree program through which students would receive their Master’s degree over two years instead of one. Students who opted for the two-year program were required to sign a contract acknowledging their recognition of the online format prior to enrollment.
In an FAQ posted on its website, HGSE confirmed students who opted for part-time enrollment would be ineligible to take in-person courses in the fall as a “matter of equity and transparency.” The same webpage states that all students — including part-time enrollees — are “welcome to use” HGSE and Harvard campus facilities when in Cambridge.
In past months, however, many part-time students have disputed the administration’s fulfillment of its commitment to delivering a quality virtual experience.
In an Aug. 25 letter to HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long and Senior Associate Dean Matthew L. Miller, 88 HGSE students and alumni voiced their frustrations with the virtual offerings. The letter identified concerns in six areas — including the quality of remote courses and priority registration for online courses — and provided recommendations to help “close the quality gap” between the in-person and virtual experience.
“When HGSE released the course catalog for AY 2021-22, it is not an exaggeration to say that many of us were devastated,” the letter reads. “We were also shocked by the degree to which the school overlooked many of the key factors — like time zone-equitable, online course offerings with core faculty members — that made the part-time program a viable and worthwhile option for many of us in the first place.”
Part-time student Rachel Diaz, who lives in Cambridge, said she had remained “hopeful” she could return to campus once the Covid-19 crisis stabilized. It was “really frustrating,” however, to witness graduate students from other schools — even those who had taken time off during the pandemic — being welcomed in person with “open arms,” she said.
“Right as I’m hearing about this — that I can’t go to HGSE in person — I’m hearing about people at HBS and HKS that are getting ready to move to campus,” she said.
She said the classes she found interesting at HGSE were all ones she was ineligible to take as a part-time, online student.
“The majority of classes I wanted to take were still at HGSE — they were just in-person classes that I couldn’t take,” she said. “I didn’t want to do another year of only online.”
Instead, she said, she turned to cross-registering in classes at other Harvard schools, and ended up with no HGSE classes this semester.
M. Jenny Wechter, another part-time student at HGSE who lives in Cambridge, wrote in an email that she also used cross-registration to access in-person learning.
“I’m cross-registered at other schools just to be in-person,” she wrote. “The learning is completely different … much deeper … I feel privileged to be able to have this opportunity and am also incredibly disheartened for the students who are being told that an online degree is comparable because it simply isn’t.”
HGSE spokesperson Bari E. Walsh declined to comment for this article.
The FAQ regarding part-time enrollment stated HGSE will curate a “robust” set of courses and opportunities for part-time students. According to Wechter, however, there have been “no events” to connect part-time students in the area.
Wechter acknowledged that the school is “between a rock and a hard place,” but argued that the virtual experience has been marked by deficiencies.
“If HGSE opens the door for us now, they’ll be in a hard place with students who would have gone part-time had they known it would have led to in-person learning,” she wrote. “But then you have students like me who are in the area and not allowed in classes in person, so the bottom line is that student learning is being neglected.”
The August letter also pointed to issues faced by international students in the part-time program.
Gleb A. Lantsman, a part-time student studying from Russia, said there are inherent difficulties in coordinating classes across time zones, but some HGSE faculty have made a concerted effort to accommodate international students.
“I mean, no hard feelings if they cannot do an a.m. and a p.m.,” Lantsman said. “I think given the circumstances, they are doing well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
African and African American Studies professor and renowned novelist Jamaica Kincaid presented a lecture about colonization and land use to affiliates at the Harvard Graduate School of Design on Thursday.
Her lecture was part of the Frederick Law Olmsted Lecture Series, an annual event that invites speakers across academic disciplines to discuss landscapes and architecture.
Though originally intended to promote interest in architect Frederick Law Olmstead, the lecture series has evolved into the principal event of the Landscape Architecture Department.
Kincaid began her presentation by recounting her childhood in Dominica, where she moved to at the age of nine from Antigua.
“My mother is from Dominica, and at some point, as a punishment to me, I was sent to Dominica when I was nine,” Kincaid said. “[Dominica] is the opposite of Antigua. It rains all the time.”
“I was centered on an acre, and I was going to school there. I was sitting with my classmates, under a tamarind tree,” she added. “A tamarind, as you know, is native to India, so it got to us through the Great Empire redistribution of the Garden of Eden.”
Kincaid then segued into a conversation about Christopher Columbus being used as a “tool” by Spanish King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to promote colonialism.
Kincaid said she finds meaning in the descriptions that Columbus used when he first arrived to the New World.
“One of my favorite things to read and to teach is the journal of Christopher Columbus, especially the first journal where he describes this new landscape he is seeing for the first time and had not expected to see at all,” Kincaid said. “It was something entirely new to him — this world of the Caribbean."
For Columbus, though, this interest in the New World soon devolved into commodification, she explained.
“He begins to categorize the land and the people in it as slaves and a commodity,” Kincaid said. “He immediately commodifies everything he sees, and it seems almost to be a very European idea.”
“The way of regarding the landscape that we've inherited is it’s money — it’s monetized,” she added.
Kincaid connected the arrival of Europeans in the New World with modern ideas about land and land use.
“It's just around that time that having met all these new people and all this land that they began to have ideas about their own nationalities and their own borders and their own places and you get all kinds of weird philosophies about origins,” she said.
In addition to discussing Columbus, Kincaid also touched on the namesake of the lecture, Olmsted, and his connections to slavery.
“I've been reading his book about the Atlantic states, and slavery, and it's not good,” Kincaid said.
Though Kincaid outlined her misgivings about the book, she said she will not denounce Olmstead himself — who co-designed New York City’s Central Park.
“In those days, anybody who could have slaves, generally would,” Kincaid explained. “So, I will enjoy Central Park and all the other places I've been where he's had such a remarkable influence.”
“I very much depend on memory, and so when I'm asked about — to reflect on — landscape, just a whole slew of thoughts and impressions and feelings rush into me,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team has had no trouble avoiding the rough, with three top-three team finishes to start its fall season.
“There is a lot to feel positive about,” said Harvard men’s golf coach Kevin Rhoads of how the season has unfolded so far. “We’re very strong, we’re a talented team, we’re a skilled team, it’s an extremely hard-working team… They want to accomplish big things.”
Starting the season on Sept. 11, Harvard finished in a tie for second with the University of Connecticut at The Doc Gimmler tournament hosted by St. John’s University in Bethpage, N.Y. Sophomores Brian Ma and Kevin Sze led the Crimson with scores of two under par after three grueling rounds, earning them two spots of a five-way tie for third out of 77 total golfers. First-year Diego Saavedra-Davila was the next best performer for the team, shooting four over par, and tying for 20th with four others. The other two Crimson that qualified also contributed, with sophomore Adam Xiao shooting eight over to tie for 35th, and senior Ollie Cordeiro shooting 18 over to finish in a tie for 69th.
The team followed its strong performance at St. John’s with a slight step back, coming in third outright at the Macdonald Cup hosted by Yale on Sept. 26. Again, Ma led the charge, shooting three under par, tying Hunter Thomson of the University of Michigan for second. Sze and Saavedra-Davila found it difficult to replicate their earlier performances, suffering slight dropbacks, tying for 11th with five over par, and tying for 41st with 14 over par, respectively. Senior captain Peter George performed exceptionally well in his first outing of the season after failing to qualify for The Doc Gimmler, finishing third for the Crimson and 18th overall, shooting eight over par. Xiao, the final Crimson representative, climbed the rankings, finishing in a tie for 29th, shooting 11 over.
However, Harvard’s last outing, the Autumn Invitational hosted by Columbia in Kingston, N.Y., on Indigenous People’s Day, was its most dominant one yet. Sending Sze, Ma, Saavedra-Davila, along with first-year Jeff Fang and sophomore Alex Zhu — both competing in their first collegiate tournaments — the Crimson finished in the top spot by an astounding 22 strokes. Sze took first outright, beating Ma, who grabbed second, by two strokes. Zhu finished fifth, Fang tying for 15th, and Saavedra-Davila rounded the five out by tying for 32nd.
The Crimson’s strong return comes after losing all of last season to Covid-19. Ma, like many of his teammates, made the most of the situation, taking a gap year and using it to work on his game. He credits the unique opportunity as part of the squad’s success.
“So many of us took gap years because of the pandemic, and we just used a lot of that time to practice, get our games better,” he said.
Furthermore, he believes that abundant talent on the team creates a drive among his teammates, cultivating a competitive yet close team chemistry.
“The team has some of the best talent we’ve ever had and it creates a very competitive environment — I think all of the guys on the team want to be close, want to get better, and see their teammates playing well, excelling on the golf course, that also pushes them to be the best that they can… It’s only going to get better,” he said.
Sze shared Ma’s confidence in the group’s dynamic and talent.
“Whoever we take to those events, I know that they’ll be ready to go — we’re going to be in contention again and rack up some more victories, bring home some more hardware,” he said.
Sze emphasized how special he found this specific group of golfers, claiming their intentions of “kind of changing the reputation behind Harvard.”
“We’re actually good at this thing,” he said. “[The] ultimate goal at the end of the year is to win Ivies and then also be relevant on a national stage is something that has been our reach goal, and I think it’s something that is definitely achievable with the talent we have this year.”
Coach Rhoads added to the optimism, yet remained realistic about what remains ahead.
“It’s a long season,” he said. “It takes a lot to want to continue to push all the time, and we’ll see if we’re up to that challenge.”
The Crimson has two more tournaments to finish out their fall season, with the Lehigh University 2021 Invitational on Oct. 22 and 23, and Ivy League Match Play against Yale and Princeton, which has yet to be tentatively scheduled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the lion is the king of the jungle, the leopard may be its secret service. Although the most commonly-cited estimates indicate that more than 700,000 leopards still roam the wild, they tend to be solitary creatures, often hiding in the canopies of trees on the savannah. For adventure-seeking tourists who travel to Eastern and Southern Africa, leopard sightings have proven elusive. On Saturday, though, the Leopards will face an even more elusive opponent, when Lafayette (2-4, 1-1 Patriot League) travels to face No. 19/RV Harvard (4-0, 2-0 Ivy) and its prolific rushing attack.
Despite two relatively slow rushing games dropping it from the second-highest average in the Football Championship Series (FCS) entering the Oct. 2 matchup against Holy Cross to 15th prior to the Lafayette game, the Crimson offense has still managed to rack up an average of 209 rushing yards per game. The attack is led by junior Aaron Shampklin, who currently holds top-ten marks nationally in rushing yards per game (4th; 117.0) and yards per carry (5th; 7.2), and his six touchdowns on the ground — in just four games —are good enough for twelfth. His exploits are complemented by solid seasons from sophomore Aidan Borguet, the 2019 Ivy League Rookie of the Year, and sophomore Sone Ntoh, who found the end zone twice against Brown.
“I believe that we have one of the best backfields in the country,” junior safety James Herring wrote in an email to The Crimson. “[Shampklin], [Borguet], and [Ntoh] are all very talented backs that keep us on our toes at practice. By practicing against the best every day, we as a unit are ready each week for anything thrown at us.”
In its last game against Cornell on Oct. 9, Harvard fell into an early 7-3 hole, entering the halftime break in a deficit for the first time in 2021. Instead of panicking, the Crimson picked up the energy in the second half and took advantage of the opportunities they had squandered in the first half, pulling away in the third quarter to secure a 24-10 victory and extend its unblemished record to 4-0. Herring credited his team’s resilience to both head coach Tim Murphy and senior linebacker Jordan Hill, who is serving as the 147th captain of Harvard football this season.
“[Murphy] always says the right thing and did a good job rallying us for a second half comeback, but I’d like to emphasize [Hill]’s impact. When he speaks, everyone listens. He is a true leader of men and everyone on the team unites behind him,” he wrote.
Now ranked 19th in the FCS Coaches’ Poll, Harvard is off to its best start since 2016, which also marked the last time it held a national ranking (No. 15). If it is able to defeat the Leopards at 1 p.m. at Harvard Stadium and move to 5-0, it will match a feat it has not pulled off since the Ivy League-winning 2015 team won its first eight games. A victory would also mark its 18th win in 21 all-time matchups against Lafayette and its seventh in a row.
The Leopards enter the game with some momentum after cruising to a 27-0 victory over Bucknell on Oct. 9, its first shutout since 2017. Overall, they have won two out of their last three games, with the exception being a 42-41 loss to Fordham. Their defense held the Bison to just 169 total yards, and they managed to sack quarterback Nick Semptimphelter four times. Linebacker Marco Olivas compiled 16 tackles, and he is tied for eighth nationally in total tackles (62).
In addition to Olivas, Lafayette boasts defensive lineman Malik Hamm, an All-Patriot League First Team selection in Spring 2021, as well as Damon Washington and DaRon Gilbert, who earned Second Team nods. The Leopards’ defensive prowess has allowed them to boast the 14th-stingiest passing defense in the nation (170.7 yards per game), the best Harvard has faced so far this season.
If it is to top that number, the Crimson will rely on sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean, who came on in relief of senior quarterback Jake Smith against Cornell. Dean, who started each of the first two games of the season before being hobbled by an injury, outperformed the upperclassman, completing 12 of his 21 passes for 204 yards and a 75-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver B.J. Watson. Watson’s score tied for the 16th-longest in school history.
Watson is joined in a deep wide receiver corps by junior Kym Wimberly and first-year Kaedyn Odermann, who earned Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors after his performance against Holy Cross. Crimson fans can also expect heavy doses of Shampklin and Borguet; despite Lafayette’s performance against Bucknell, it still ranks as just the 60th best rushing defense in the FCS, allowing 149 yards per game.
Meanwhile, Harvard’s defense will face a fresh challenge. The new-look Leopards offense is led by a true freshman, quarterback Ah-Shaun Davis, the only first-year signal-caller the Crimson has faced so far. In the 2021 season, he has shown very few signs of inexperience, completing 67.8 percent of his passes for 825 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception, including a 354-yard performance in the loss to Fordham. Herring noted that while Davis posed a formidable threat, he hoped that his stifling defense would induce some rookie mistakes.
“I am impressed with [Davis],” he wrote. “The kid has an incredible arm and shows poise for his young age. However, there is a savviness that comes with experience. We expect [Davis] to air the ball out and when that happens mistakes will inevitably happen. Our goal is to capitalize on those mistakes.”
For Davis and the Leopards to find much success against Harvard, they will have to present a multifaceted offense. Like Cornell, Lafayette prefers to run the ball, despite Davis’ arm strength. Against Bucknell, three ball-carriers made a significant impact on the game, with running backs Selwyn Simpson and Michael Hayes and wide receiver Joe Gillette each rushing for more than fifty yards and a touchdown. All in all, Lafayette turned its 38 carries into 194 yards (5.1 yards per carry). When Davis takes to the air, his top targets are Gillette, wide receiver Julius Young, and tight end Mason Gilbert.
On the other hand, Harvard believes it is well-equipped to handle the Leopards’ attack. Herring has led the Crimson in tackles in each of the past two games, racking up 12 against Holy Cross and matching senior linebacker Andrew Irwin with nine against Cornell. In addition to Herring, Harvard boasts a strong front seven that ranks fourth nationally, conceding just 63 yards per game on the ground so far in 2021.
Herring’s secondary is stingy against the pass as well, ranking sixth in the country in team passing efficiency defense (101.3). Senior cornerback Khalid Thomas and sophomore cornerback Khalil Dawsey have each intercepted two passes in three games this season, tying for fifth in the FCS with 0.7 picks per contest. Junior defensive lineman Chris Smith also shares fifth nationally with 0.5 forced fumbles per game.
“Our coaches create a great scheme each week and all we have to do is execute. Also, our front seven makes life easy for a third-line player. The [defensive line] has dominated this season and our [linebackers] play sound, physical football,” Herring wrote.
The Lafayette game marks the last non-conference matchup Harvard will play this season. It enters the bulk of the Ivy League regular season tied for first with Dartmouth, but both the Big Green and No. 20/25 Princeton are undefeated as well. On Oct. 23, the Crimson will travel to Princeton, N.J., to face off against the Tigers, and, the week after that, Dartmouth will enter Harvard Stadium seeking its third straight victory in the series. As his team continues its quest for its 18th Ivy League championship, Herring admitted that he has been looking forward to the second half of the season.
“We always focus on the opponent in front of us, but I would be lying to say that we have not paid attention to our rivals,” he wrote. “Princeton, Yale, and Dartmouth are always formidable opponents, and we look forward to playing them in the coming weeks.”
The Lafayette game can be streamed live on ESPN+ and covered on the radio by Bloomberg WRCA (1330 AM/106.1 FM).

It’s the time of year where there’s more ~color~ everywhere—in the trees, in our lives, and most importantly, in our Google Calendars. And with the Add/Drop deadline behind us, those long days without lunch breaks are now officially here to stay. But never fear: Flyby is here to teach you how to get those carbs (and veggies) in, even in the busiest of weeks.
Drop by FlyBy (Not to be confused with Flyby Blog!)
For the chronic overschedulers, drop by FlyBy (or Baby Berg for freshmen) before or in between back-to-back classes! The line winding through Annenberg basement or the SEAS building may seem daunting at first, but trust us — once you leave with three packets of Oreos to stuff in your face during the CS50 break, you’ll realize that it was all worth it. Plus, the sandwiches and wraps are great for sneaking in bites under your mask on your way to class.
HUDS Take out
If you feel like you don’t have enough hours in the day for all the midterm studying you have to do, take HUDS back to your room! Picture this: you’re eating a lukewarm blend of what appears to be baked beans, Red’s Best Fresh Catch, and salad out of a plastic box as you cry over your never-ending task list. Add fairy lights twinkling in the background and you’ve got a scene that speaks to the heart of mid-October college life. And even if you end up spending the next hour rewatching The Office instead of catching up on your GenEd readings, it’s the thought that counts, right?
Really maximize on those to-go containers.
This is on here twice for a reason. Sure, after your fifth plastic-box request of the day, the HUDS staff may start to know you by name and walk the other way when they see you coming. Still, just keep reminding yourself that there is no limit to what these boxes can store. Pro-tip: To-go containers don’t have to just be for storing a typical meal. Take an extra to fill up with brownies and cookies for your room, and you’ll be the favorite suitemate by the time the midnight sugar cravings roll around.
If all else fails, load up on snacks. 
CVS wasn’t playing when they opened a store right in the middle of Harvard Square. Stock up on all your favorite foods (and empty your wallet) to satisfy any late night craving you may have. But a word of caution: after you’ve made instant mac & cheese once, it might be hard to stop.
Whatever the method, please remember to make time to eat, sleep, and take yourself. Fueling your body is important, and even if it doesn’t feel like it, your four unfinished psets can wait just a little bit more.
