September 22-24, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Margaret C. Kerr ’13
Produced by Natalie S. Feldman ’12 and Sasha G. Mironov ’13
A theater painted to resemble a crumbling building, in a world in which everything is at war, is the striking underpinning of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s first production of the new school year, “Far Away,” written by Caryl Churchill. In the play’s dystopian vision of the future, everything must take sides, and the word “alliance” doesn’t even exist. Basic elements—earth, wind, and fire—fight amongst each other, violence and murder become the norm, and young hatmaker Joan tries to live a stable life amid the chaos.
Despite the subject matter, Churchill’s script is subtle, dealing with the violence of this ravaged world with a practiced nonchalance. For director Margaret C. Kerr ’13, these circumspect mentions of violence are even more powerful than the physical act. Georgina B. Parfitt ’13, who plays protagonist Joan, found that the understated script leads her character to internalize the violence of the world around her. “I had to … find that tiredness, that exhaustion,” she says. The numbness required is challenging as an actor, since “I’m used to doing things where you show emotion, where you cry a little, you kind of get that shouting wrenching thing,” she says.
The show’s technical aspects don’t echo this passivity; both sound and lighting are constantly changing. “Far Away” begins with the comforting sounds of a homestead. By act three, as the world descends into chaos, and “this sort of foggy, hazy light swallows the actors onstage,” Kerr says.  This environment begins to represent the inner turmoil of Churchill’s characters, especially Todd, Joan’s love interest, played by Yi Jun Tan ’13. “Todd is definitely affected by this war effort that [spans] the world and it’s fun to see what you can do with that [as an actor],” says Tan. Kerr expands this sentiment to the whole production: “[‘Far Away’] gives an idea of a future we could be headed towards if cycles of violence … aren’t stopped.”

Museum of Fine Arts, Boston College Night
September 22, 7 p.m.
465 Huntington Avenue, Boston
It could be argued that the average college student’s life is ordered around what costs money and what does not. On September 22 from 7 to 11 p.m., the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA) in Boston is making an offer that falls on the “does not” side of that divide. At the MFA’s College Night, students “will be some of the first people to come see inside” the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art and can also explore the newly renovated Art of the Americas Wing, digital marketing coordinator Christy B. Stine says. Attendees can also meet thousands of college students from the Boston area, practice their drawing skills with provided models and supplies, and enjoy free refreshments, courtesy of Chipotle and Pinkberry.
The event features a gallery performance by Keith Fullerton Whitman, as well as a coffeehouse performance by acoustic musician and Berklee College of Music alumna Liz Longley in the museum’s restaurant, Bravo.
“It’s a great social event,” Stine says. “I think it’s a great introduction to the museum for people who haven’t been before. You don’t get to have your own special party in the museum every day.”
The museum hopes to maintain a relationship with university students of the Boston area and remind them that admission is free every day. Only on College Night, however, can students mingle only with other college students in a museum environment, enjoy a dance party courtesy of DJ LeahV, and hula-hoop in a “big, soaring glass courtyard … a perfect place for the hula-hoops to go on,” public relations representative Katharine T. Mohana says.
Max Wang ’13 appreciates the effort the museum is putting into reaching out to students who may not have thought to visit the MFA.
“It’s naturally hard for a museum to get students at the college of a big research university to engage with the museum,” Wang says. However, as demonstrated by the approximately 5,000 students who attended College Night in 2010, the MFA will likely have no trouble attracting students this year. One of them may be Wang, who says he sees the appeal of such an event.
“Come and get to know us,” Mohana says. “Get to know the museum and what we have to offer.” Students with I.D. cards may do so anytime from 7 to 11 p.m. on September 22.

Both heart-wrenching and funny, Geoffrey Nauffts’s play “Next Fall” brings its audience into the living room of two gay lovers questioning faith and existence: is it acceptable for a gay Christian to sin in love if he believes in Christ? Continuing Speakeasy Stage Company’s tradition of putting on shows that delve into philosophical questions about human nature, “Next Fall”—playing at the Boston Center for the Arts through October 15—presents a fresh perspective on the lives of gay couples through biting humor and hauntingly realistic drama.
The play opens with the spotlight on two characters standing on opposite sides of the stage. Luke (Dan Roach) and Adam (Will McGarrahan) are illuminated in an almost heavenly glow. Luke recites a passage from the Bible in a sincere trance, and then the stage plunges into darkness, only to be relit on a jarringly different scene: the waiting room of a hospital. What ensues is banter reminiscent of Woody Allen’s wit as the characters make small talk, each seeming to know the other only vaguely. We are left wondering what could have possibly brought these characters together.
When the scene ends, the actors again scramble in darkness, rearrange themselves, and reenact memories from five years prior. With the help of musical interlude, different lighting, and fluid set changes, the actors accomplish the difficult task of switching between two portrayals of reality. Each character shifts between present and past, changing outfits with a frantic determination, as though it is his or her responsibility to relay an important message. The result is a production that, though visually inconstant and often chronologically skewed, maintains a remarkable coherence throughout.
Will McGarrahan and Deb Martin (Holly, a friend of Adam’s) project an enormous amount of energy in the show, working off each other’s quirky witticisms expertly. Their repartee make the inherently funny premise of the show—Adam dating a devout believer and working with Holly in a candle and “tchotchke” shop—even more uproarious. McGarrahan portrays Adam as a twitchy, paranoid, gay, Jewish atheist who endlessly taunts the Christians around him. Just after Adam and Luke have their first night together, Adam catches Luke praying, and asks, “Where did you go just then?” Luke responds that he was praying, and after a pause, Adam says, “Praying to whom?” Such tension over religious belief manifests itself in small actions—Luke attempting to take the mezuzah hanging in their New York apartment off the doorway—and in statements of finality—Adam tells Luke at one point, “I want you to love me more than Him.”
The actors, script, lighting, and director work together extremely well and everything in the play seems to have a purpose. A set of chairs, a couch, and industrial hanging lamps make up most of the scenery. The easy set transformation from hospital to home happens not so much by rearranging furniture as by using the props in a different way. The director, Scott Edmiston, has had much experience dealing with risky shows—at the Speakeasy, he has directed “In the Next Room (or the vibrator play)” and “Reckless,” and his experience shows clearly. There is no break between the prop-driven humor—a stuffed elf falls out of a closet, to much laughter—and emotional honesty, when Arelene (Amelia Broome) admits to her struggles with motherhood and drug use.
Geoffrey Nauffts intends for his play to pose questions not usually considered in everyday life. A homosexual and religious person may go through great confusion and anxiety with regards to his or her faith, but ultimately the play is about love and two people who must make compromises if they want to make it work. This is something universal, presented in a new light.

In ancient China, “straw dogs” referred to ceremonial objects that were at first adored and revered, but then quickly discarded when the occasion for their use had passed. It’s a group of these castaways and misfits in human form that comes into direct confrontation with the protagonists of Rod Lurie’s remake of “Straw Dogs,” a coarse, violent story of culture clash and the limits of civilization. But despite having complex, multi-layered source material from which to draw, Lurie’s “Straw Dogs” is unable to handle its heavy, primal material, and instead presents a shallow imitation of its predecessor.
“Straw Dogs” begins with a young couple, Amy (Kate Bosworth) and David Sumner (James Marsden) arriving at Amy’s hometown in rural Blackwater, Mississippi. Quickly they come at odds with the locals, and in particular Charlie (Alexander Skarsgard), Amy’s high school ex-boyfriend. Tensions rise, and the urbane couple soon find themselves embroiled in a life-and-death struggle far from the comforts or safeguards of society.
The original “Straw Dogs,” featuring Dustin Hoffman and Susan George in the lead roles, was controversial at the time for its graphic depiction of rape and violence. But while Lurie tries to tackle these subjects himself, he does so in such an abrasive way that the aftertaste is unpleasant—not so much provocative as repulsive. “Straw Dogs” is too often tactlessly explicit with its message and imagery, and in so doing sacrifices any sense of subtlety; this prevents the implications of its contents from manifesting naturally. The film wields the cinematic equivalent of a sledgehammer, when its material calls for a scalpel. From the testosterone-filled masculinity complex that pervades the film to its gratuitous display of murder and death, “Straw Dogs” is saturated in stereotypes that prevent it from becoming anything more than a superficial remake.
Much of this failure lies in Lurie’s screenplay and the poorly drawn people that inhabit it. The wants and desires of the characters are not clearly defined, leaving them hollow and devoid of real emotion, and the audience confused as to their motivations. Charlie is clearly attracted to Amy, but why is he still so attached to her after so many years apart? What was the substance of their prior relationship? Why is Janice (Willa Holland), the daughter of the drunkard Tom Heddon (James Woods), infatuated with the local outcast Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell), who clearly is not in the right state of mind? It’s these basic questions that make the movie a muddled mess, rather than a stark, vivid display of wrong and right and the gray areas in between. It’s impossible to empathize with characters who make so little sense.
This is a shame, particularly in light of the spirited performance of Bosworth, who manages to stretch what little she is given to its maximum potential. As Amy, Bosworth—unlike most others in the film—is able to evoke compassion and sympathy from the audience as her character struggles with the aftermath of rape. The subtlety in this portrayal stands in stark contrast to the blunt, underdeveloped acting that occupies the rest of “Straw Dogs.” Skarsgard, who is primarily known for his parts in the TV shows “True Blood” and “Generation Kill,” performs well enough considering the confines of his character, but the range of his emotions does not differ much from his past roles.
The unevenness that permeates the film extends to its pacing and tone. Starting off with a dramatic lull, “Straw Dogs” gives its audience a misleading impression as to how it will handle the conflict between its characters. A sudden break in narrative tenor for the film’s final reel, culminating in an attack on Amy’s and David’s house, is unwelcome and startling, akin to the experience of blood rushing to the head. It’s as if two different movies were melded together, without any common thread. This volatile turn is far too much, far too late, and makes a mockery of the movie’s message by shading into oft-offensive B-grade horror movie antics.
Ultimately, “Straw Dogs” does not have the astuteness or creative dexterity to examine the primal nature of the human psyche or the cynicism of civilized society. Something rings false about the film. Much like the straw dogs that are thrown out in the street, this is a film that will be remembered as nothing more than a fleeting remake—if at all.

A sleek night landscape. The crescendo of tension in a pulsing neon city. Dry, haggard days. And cars. This is the underworld of Los Angeles as imagined by director Nicolas Winding Refn in his latest film “Drive.” In a dark, gritty homage to the crime cinema of yore, Refn artfully juxtaposes love and duty with grippingly horrific violence and distress, creating a hypnotic and powerful film that sears through the mind long after the credits end.
Ryan Gosling stars as the unnamed “Driver,” a man of few words with an inner penchant for brutality. That propensity explodes in full force when he has to protect a woman and child to whom he has grown close. By day, Gosling’s character works as a mechanic and a stunt car driver for Hollywood action flicks. By night, he drives getaway vehicles contracted by criminals for a variety of heists. His insomniac double life never seems to take a physical toll, only an emotional one—the Driver maintains a Spartan existence bereft of possessions and personal involvements. “I’m yours, no matter what,” he promises the men who hire him—but only for the five-minute window he allows them to pull off their robbery. After that, he is unattached and uninvolved, refusing to even acknowledge a former client he encounters in a bar.
But experiencing what may be the first emotional attachment in his previously solitary and single-minded life, the Driver swears that he will protect Irene (Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos) from a vengeful group of gangsters who harbor a grudge against her family for the actions of her ex-con husband Standard (Oscar Isaac).
In telling this story, Refn imbues “Drive” with a rich, dark color palette to match its narrative tones. Los Angeles is a dusty and harsh world in daylight, almost stereotypically Western with muted primary colors. But by night, it transforms into a streamlined and futuristic city, where color stands out only from dashboards, headlights, and road signs. A slight overreliance on slow motion also hearkens back to old Westerns, but the technique is adeptly offset by the tense acceleration of the film’s car chases and gruesome murders that increase in frequency as “Drive” progresses.
Just as the violence builds, so too does the hidden, dark undercurrent of the Driver’s personality. At the beginning of the film, he appears shy and soft-spoken, though ruthlessly competent in his ability to handle cars. Yet as the film unfolds, it becomes clear that underneath his taciturn exterior is a veritable monster of a man. The first time he unleashes his anger, he orders an opponent to “Shut your mouth, or I’ll kick your teeth down your throat and shut it for you.” For a character that has barely uttered a complete sentence up to this point, and whose only declaratives, for the most part, have been gentle and truncated, this break in character unleashes the lethal firestorm that makes up the second half of the film.
This thematic split in “Drive”—from relatively ordinary character portrayals to serious and sudden violence—is jarring, but adds to the film’s unpredictability, which is perhaps its greatest and most consistent strength. And while the movie’s character archetypes at first seem one-dimensional, their undeveloped nature keeps the audience constantly in the present. No sepia-toned flashbacks explain how the Driver became so immune to violence that he could unflinchingly smash a man’s brains to pulp with his foot. This lack of justification forces the audience to accept every character’s actions at face value, no matter how hard to stomach these actions may be.
The movie is propelled through its hypnotic lows and screeching highs by an electronic, pulsating soundtrack composed by Cliff Martinez that perfectly infuses tension into every moment, even the seemingly idyllic. In a movie with a serious dearth of dialogue, the true emotion surges through the music, including standout tracks by electro-pop artists Kavinsky and Electric Youth. Irene and the Driver may never really talk about their feelings for each other, but in this movie, the soundtrack often expresses the emotions that the characters can’t—a woman intoning “There’s something inside you, it’s hard to explain / They’re talking about you, boy, but you’re still the same,” makes it clear how Irene actually feels.
All in all, “Drive” is an original, gloriously artistic film whose achievement lies less in its commendable script and acting and more in its gritty and wholly engrossing atmosphere—a triumph of direction, musical composition, and editing. The film’s explicit violence and implicit tension are disconcerting, volatile and gripping, succeeding on a visceral level alongside effective and twisted storytelling. For these reasons alone, “Drive” is not a film to miss—just don’t eat lunch beforehand.

Supermom. Soccer mom. Co-parent. These are just a few of the expressions that have emerged to describe the increasingly complicated roles played by women in contemporary society. “I Don’t Know How She Does It,” a new comedy directed by Douglas McGrath, attempts to make light of the struggle many of these women face when balancing work and family.
Adapted from Allison Pearson’s 2002 novel of the same name, the film tells the story of Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker), a busy Boston financial executive with two young children. Kate shoulders most of the financial burden for her family while her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) transitions between jobs. After she accepts a major new account that demands frequent trips to New York, Kate finds herself with more responsibilities than she can manage. The job also places her in regular contact with a suave new business partner named Jack (Pierce Brosnan). Alongside these mainstays, Olivia Munn delivers a convincing performance as Kate’s steely, childless, and Harvard-educated assistant, Momo, who is bemused by her boss’s decision to juggle both a family and a rigorous job. Christina Hendricks, best known for her work on HBO’s “Mad Men,” joins Parker on the big screen as Kate’s best friend and fellow working mother, Allison.
In the world depicted by screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, women are each other’s most vicious saboteurs. They turn birthday parties and workouts into competitions, criticize each other’s appearance “Mean Girls”-style, and pass judgment on that most unforgivable of failures: bringing a store-bought pie to the school bake sale. McKenna’s past work includes the 2008 flick “27 Dresses” (dir. Anne Fletcher) and the 2006 hit “The Devil Wears Prada,” (dir. David Frankel) another movie that touches on workplace power dynamics. Alas, “I Don’t Know” lacks the sass and snappy dialogue of “Prada.” Despite its talented cast, the film merely rehashes a familiar set of stock characters—the Office Jerk, the Supermom, the Critical Mother-in-Law—without doing much to shake up the genre, or our expectations regarding the plotline.
Kate, at her best, is endearing, relatable, and even occasionally funny. For 89 minutes, viewers get to watch her stumble around in heels, drop things, and generally careen from one near-disaster to another. But the performance is too often one-dimensional and predictable. We don’t know much about Kate’s personality, other than that she loves her family, and that she loves her job because, as she puts it, “the market doesn’t know what sex I am. It only knows if I’m right or wrong.” It’s difficult to believe in the chemistry between Kate and her husband, or to take seriously her nascent flirtation with Jack.
Perhaps to compensate for a sparse storyline, director McGrath—whose other works include “Emma” and “Infamous”—has interspersed the film with mock interviews with the characters. One character compares a working woman’s mind to a control tower at O’Hare International Airport. Another equates marriage with being “on parole.” Through these somewhat self-conscious exchanges, the film situates itself in an awkward middle ground between confronting sexual double standards and attempting to be a lighthearted comedy.
But the experience presented in “I Don’t Know” is relatively limited in scope. Whether squabbling with her husband in their spacious Boston apartment or spending long hours at the office, Kate always has the financial freedom to hire a child caretaker, not to mention wear clothes which look as if they could have belonged to another character Parker is famous for playing: Carrie Bradshaw of “Sex and the City.” Given this context, much of the movie’s mild moralizing rings hollow.
McGrath’s film is the latest in a long-standing tradition of movies about working women, a category that owes much to classics like the 1940s hits “His Girl Friday” and “Woman of the Year.” “I Don’t Know How She Does It” doesn’t quite live up to its predecessors, and while viewers may cringe at lines like “‘difficult’ is really just a word for anything that isn’t a man” or “trying to be a man is a waste of a woman,” the film does deserve credit for bringing up the issue of gender roles at all. Though the rest of us may take a pass, Parker fans and career parents may enjoy seeing the movie in theatres—after work, of course.

In just over five years, Jonah Hill has gone from being a side-splitting minor character in assorted Judd Apatow movies to an actor widely recognized for his unmistakable talent, even outside of comedy films. The 27-year-old actor is currently starring alongside Brad Pitt and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the drama “Moneyball,” marking an important transition in his career. For while Hill has proved a brilliant funnyman, his new role displays a level of performance versatility and personal maturity beyond any of his previous work.
“Moneyball” tells the true story of Billy Beane (Pitt), an ex-baseball player who, while serving as General Manager for the Oakland Athletics in 2002, employed a different system of player selection that privileges new statistical metrics over received baseball wisdom. In his quest to identify undervalued players, Beane hires Peter Brand (Hill), an overweight Yale-educated economist who has extensively studied this particular field of sports-science. Together, the men compile a team that goes on to win a record 20 consecutive games and to craft a system of player evaluation that forever changes the game of baseball.
Though well-rounded, “Moneyball” would certainly be characterized as a drama—a genre relatively foreign to Hill. “There are funny moments in the movie, but they’re different types of comedy than what I’ve ever done,” he says. The actor is usually associated with the Apatow clan, a group of filmmakers responsible for more lowbrow comedies like “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” “Superbad”—in which Hill made his debut as a leading actor—and “Forgetting Sarah Marshall.” Hill’s one-liners, both on screen and off, have made him the stuff of fan legend.
But some of Hill’s snarkier comments have recently come back to haunt him. With his participation in “Moneyball,” a fair amount of media attention has been brought to bear on a statement he made about co-star Pitt years ago, to the effect that wildly attractive actors like Pitt don’t need to try as hard to succeed in the world of motion pictures. Asked about these words now, Hill chalks them up to immaturity and inexperience.
“I [emerged] in the public eye at a very young age, so often I see my idiotic words from when I was 21 or 22 years old, and that’s a perfect example,” he says. “At that point in my life, there was no part of me that ever could have imagined co-starring with Brad Pitt. What I thought I knew about the world of filmmaking then turned out to be nothing and it still is, now, just a little sliver more.”
Blunders of youth are not the only thing keeping Hill humble at the moment. “Moneyball” represents a genre of film in which he has minimal experience, and though the actor stepped up to the plate and delivered a performance that film critics have lauded, Hill still finds himself unsettled by the uncertainty that comes with all new endeavors.
“I feel right now the way I felt when ‘Superbad’ was coming out, because I was an underdog. I was on a movie poster and I wasn’t famous; people didn’t know who I was,” he says. “Now it’s not unexpected for me to do a comedy [but] with this film I’m the underdog again because I’m unexpected and unlikely to be chosen to be in this movie with Brad and Philip Seymour Hoffman. So I’m the underdog again, I’m saying ‘Hey I’m Jonah, I hope you accept me.’”
Part of Hill’s amiable charm is his unassuming optimism. He doesn’t know exactly what’s going to happen next in his career, or what people are going to think of him in this new dramatic guise, but for the time being there’s nowhere else he’d rather be.
“Anything you want someone to see you as is a projection, and it’s false because you’re designing something ... instead of just existing,” he explains. “I just want to make cool stuff. I want to make cool movies, whether a comedy or drama or anything. I just hope to be allowed the opportunity to do what I’m doing now, which is make comedies and dramas, [to] do both and have people not hate them.”

Nowhere are the rules of the American marketplace more relevant to us Harvard students than in that strange scholasticized capitalism we call shopping period. Gregory Mankiw emerges from his lair to woo freshmen, never to be seen again (except, perhaps, for Parents’ Weekend); Paul Farmer makes a layover between Haiti and Rwanda, advertising global health to would-be do-gooders; other professors use every skill of rhetoric and eloquence at their disposal to win a coveted spot on our Study Cards.
This is not universally true, of course, and for those with stricter requirements or higher self-assurance shopping period is only a name. Yet it is striking how much emphasis many of us place on it. The oratorical power of a professor, we believe, tell us much more than a mere syllabus or coursepack could. This is what compels us to go to class even when it’s not technically necessary—or, conversely, never attend lecture even when we should. They are why Michael Sandel’s “Justice” continues to draw a thousand students, even though all his lectures are taped and he has written a full-length book hardly different  from his class.
Even though lectures often begin as essays, or at least a series of written notes, when they are spoken aloud they somehow become  more than the sum of their parts. In October of my senior year of high school, my English teacher drove the nine of us in the class up to New York to see Hamlet—which we had been studying—on Broadway. Some of us had enjoyed reading the play. I was especially captivated by the angsty soliloquies, but none of us saw in it the genius we were supposed to, or experienced the pleasure our professor thought we would.  I remember exchanging startled glances with my classmates during Act II, when Hamlet evades Polonius’ questions through wordplay and sheer craftiness. “This is funny,” we whispered to each other, leaning across the armrests of our plush seats. “This is good!”
It is a cliché to say speeches make words come alive, jump off the page—but it’s clichéd for a reason. Speeches used to be the only way to convey information to a large audience, the only means to transfer knowledge to an illiterate audience. Rhetoric was one of the only subjects required of an early  Harvard student in all three years of his education. Harvard understood the importance of fostering in its students the power to reach an audience and the tools to effectively do so.
Many Harvard courses still rely on the pedagogical power of speeches. I must  have read Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address in three different classes by now, and each time when we read it aloud it inspires me in the most saccharine sense of the word. I have parsed the speech, close-read it, and analyzed the themes and tropes, yet hearing it aloud as the president would have spoken it makes these devices fade into the background. They become only tools which enable Lincoln to take the temperature of a moment and lay out his national project.
Speeches ultimately became unnecessary for transmitting information, giving way to a literate populace and, eventually, by the heaving mass of data that is the Internet. Today anyone can expound on anything via YouTube, and the speeches of politicians have been reduced to a string of the same soundbites replayed over and over in the media. That everyone has a voice is not necessarily a bad thing—it is democracy at work. Yet with so much out there, there exists the danger of sound degenerating into noise. It becomes possible for the elevated power of Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address to be replaced in our collective memory by the naturally disenchanting minutiae of daily life.
And yet the crowds in eloquent professors’ lectures, the masses captivated by Obama’s 2008 speech in Philadelphia on race in America, suggest that we still hunger for words arranged in a certain way and spoken in a certain rhythm, giving voice to something that we might also have thought but could never have said so well. Obama has been criticized recently for his reliance on teleprompters during speeches and for the lack of passionate eloquence that so characterized his early speeches. This suggests that the spoken word continues to exert a hold over its audience, and that the president—and our other leaders—might do well to reassert that slippery skill of rhetoric, difficult to describe but instantly recognizable.

The art community has not always welcomed change. It venerates tradition, and art-enthusiasts of every era are reluctant to deem worthy works that do not conform to time-tested notions of beauty. Despite increasing acceptance of modern and contemporary art, the same resistance to change may exist today. The opera and ballet stubbornly adhere to their traditional performance methods, and that’s how their patrons like it. Sometimes, though—as publishing houses around the country have discovered this year—change cannot be ignored.
What the publishing industry faces right now is a customer base that demands a digital product even as the technology that makes these products possible is still in its early stages of development. Random House has experienced a 200 percent growth in eBook  sales this year, and every other company’s sales tell similar tales. The various devices on the market—the Kindle, the Nook, and the Kobo eReader, among others—all do different things. Thanks to each business’s attempt to dominate the market, they are mostly incompatible with each other. For example, the Nook and Apple’s iPad feature color displays for picture books, but for the time being the Kindle does not. How can a publishing house market a book only for those consumers who have one of those two eReader models? How can it spend millions converting the complex layout of a textbook into an electronic format when many of their customers don’t own an eReader at all? In the face of such bleak uncertainty, it is not surprising that the industry has been slow to transition.
Even worse for the publishing houses, the bestseller list is quietly but steadily being infiltrated by self-published works, works that have bypassed the traditional publishing system entirely. Author Amanda Hocking has become famous for uploading her books to digital bookstores after receiving multiple rejections from traditional houses. Today alone she will sell thousands of books directly to readers, without the help of a major publisher. This type of change threatens to render the entire business obsolete, assuming that other aspiring authors feel confident enough to go in alone. Maybe publishing’s heyday is dead and gone, destined to be replaced by online media that goes directly to consumers in an open marketplace.
Or maybe not. Major publishing companies joined together last year to negotiate with the internet giant that has come to dominate an unsettlingly large portion of the book retail market, and is now planning to launch its own publishing division as well. In order to promote its Kindle device, Amazon sold eBooks last year for less than the wholesale prices at which it purchased them, taking a loss that no other company could begin to afford. In response, several companies, led by New York based Macmillan Publishers, stepped in to fight for a new system to prevent such a hostile takeover of the book retail market. Amazon pulled Macmillan’s books from its site temporarily, Macmillan held out, and eventually Amazon caved, end scene. Such drama may be unpleasant for both parties, but at least the old houses won’t let books go the way of CDs or DVDs without a fight.
Along with the Amazon deal, the overwhelming increase in digital sales has already created new possibilities for reaching readers. Publishers can offer extras such as video and audio commentary with their eBooks, and picture books have been given an exciting and entirely new medium with the rise of the iPad. While there are still those who continue to cling to the beauty of the traditionally printed word, literature is not dependent on its physical form. Unlike an opera or ballet, the words of Dickens, Chaucer, and Shakespeare still ring true even on an electronic screen. The essence of the art is inextinguishable, and the rest may turn out to be just details.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The merest opening of a common buttercup on a piece of wasteground in the light of an ordinary day," says Bernice Bayoude, a character in Ali Smith’s latest novel, "the mere blowing along a road of a piece of litter, is enough to dispel the so-called truth of every single thing online. But we’re forgetting how to know what’s real. That’s the real problem." It’s an idea that pervades the novel, entitled "There but for the"—that our experiences in life are fleeting, but that transient things can change us forever. The novel follows the lives of four loosely connected characters. The work vividly conveys a loose web of colliding moments, some of which touch its character’s souls. It’s a moving approach, and "There but for the" strikes a careful balance between witty, mild satire of the alienation of contemporary culture and serious inquiry into human thought and connection. For all its thoughtfulness, though, "There but for the" is rarely cohesive enough to achieve the elegiac aesthetic and muscular critical inquiry for which it strives. Rather, its restless questing, intentionally or not, leaves Smith’s troubling meditations empty.
The novel is ostensibly about a man named Miles Garth, who leaves the table during a dinner party to lock himself in the guest room for several months, bewildering the host of the dinner party into feeding him under her guest room door. He never explains his reasons for doing this. Many people conclude he’s some kind of messiah and set up an elaborate operation to feed him from the backyard, offering psychic readings to passers-by in the meanwhile. While this scenario has clever, ironic overtones, it also has the potential to get tiresome fast; thankfully, the foreground of the novel is far more concerned with the interiorities of four characters, linked—though none very intimately—to Miles Garth. It traces their fleeting connections with him, as well as the flashbacks and later choices that these meetings inspire.
Although scattered, these interactions have the potential to be truly stunning. One woman recalls the death of her daughter, who had known Miles in grade school; another remembers a time she met him at summer camp when they were schoolchildren. One mentions an essay Miles had written in secondary school, which reflects on how in the future, everyone has been "onced" by life. When a person is "onced," a particular moment becomes imprinted in their eyes forever; thus, the boy in Miles’ essay looks in his mother’s eye and sees "a curly-haired eighteen-year-old called Albert, which wasn’t his father’s name, and who’d once, when she was sixteen and on holiday in the Isle of Man, whistled a tune every time he passed underneath her chalet window." In his father’s eyes, he sees "a double image of a dark and deep and still pool." It’s a beautiful idea, and perhaps explains the structure of the narrative, which insists on revealing its characters through discrete, seemingly irrelevant recollections—a first kiss in a park, a daughter dying—rather than through unified life stories. It also powerfully suggests the malaise of modern life, which with Smith seems so concerned. We are all so inundated with connection, she insinuates, that these chance collisions and brief memories have replaced longer, sustained narratives as the texture of our lives.
Apt as "There but for the" may be, though, it ultimately fails to satisfy. This could be because of the sheer volume and hyperactivity of the book’s meditations: it jumps from Internet porn, to the etymology of the word "but," to Viking history, and back again. Yet perhaps its true failure lies in its focus on alienation, which never achieves emotional depth. This might be Smith’s intent. The thoughts the book expresses on everything it considers, Internet porn included, are fascinating and edgy, often ricocheting off the narrative and offering genuinely enlightening perspectives on the action. But these musings read like conversation at a hyper-intellectual, over-caffeinated dinner party, rather than presenting themselves as the true essences of people’s lives. Emotional pain is suggested, but never explored with precision or insight. We never see how people are changed by their suffering, or by their "onces." As a satire, it’s pleasant. As a portrait of contemporary culture, it’s quite brilliant—but then again, maybe it’s too accurate. Smith’s criticism of the emptiness and superficiality of modern culture is incisive, but by importing these qualities into her fiction, she only contributes to the problem.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Staff writer Anjali R. Itzkowitz can be reached at aitzkow@college.harvard.edu.
Despite its innocuous title, "I Married You for Happiness," Lily Tuck’s latest novel is not a cheerful tale. It follows the newly widowed Nina as she recollects episodes from her marriage to the mathematician Philip. For a chronicle of a 43-year marriage, this is a slim volume, and the book’s unconventional approach to time is its most intriguing and problematic feature. Presented haphazardly and in non-chronological order, Nina’s memories, from her first meeting with Philip at a Paris café to their life together in Somerville, Mass., reveal many secrets but provide no clarity.
The recollections take place over the course of Nina’s sleepless night following her husband’s sudden death from heart failure. They are punctuated by brief returns to the present, during which Nina drinks more and more wine. This steady, solitary drinking imbues even the happy memories with melancholy. A cycling tour of northern France culminates with Philip’s proposal; Philip rescues their daughter Louise’s bucket from the sea. Because Tuck deliberately avoids a chronological approach, incidents both trivial and momentous race past each other in Nina’s churning consciousness. The plot unfolds almost entirely in the past, but in a past without sequence. Nina "has no desire to think about the future. For her, the future does not exist; it is an absurd concept. She prefers to think about the past."
The more traumatic an event, the more frequently Nina recalls it. But each time the memory gets more explicit. Nina is a painter, and it is almost as if she is revisiting multiple canvasses again and again to fill out the details as she remembers them. Her ostensibly sheltered life as the stay-at-home wife of a successful Harvard professor has had more than its fair share of trauma. She has experienced rape, an affair, and an abortion. By dealing with these tragedies repeatedly––though not sequentially––Tuck creates a crushing inevitability that only adds to the gloom. Again and again, it becomes clear that Nina is, once more, back in the French forest where she was raped, or back on Belle-Île where she had her affair.
The structure of Tuck’s unconventional narrative very effectively approximates the process of memory. Nina wants to recall the early days of her relationship with Philip, full of hope and lovemaking: "She replays the scene once again in her mind. And again. She makes a few changes." But the more painful memories only come to light in raw bursts, as in the case of her abortion: "She hears the clinking of instruments in a metal basin. The man says something to her as, with his hands, he forcibly spreads her legs wider apart." Although we are in Nina’s thoughts for the entirety of the novel, the narrative is in the third person. This creates a gulf between Nina and the reader that is never penetrated despite the book’s higly personal subject matter. Despite being acquainted with the most intimate details of her life, both dramatic and mundane, we never really get insights into Nina’s character. Perhaps this is because Nina herself is so detached from the world. She is wracked not by grief but by emptiness.
Closely connected to the novel’s scattered chronology is its heavy emphasis on the concept of chance. Philip is a mathematician and an expert in probability. He and Nina have opposite relationships with the random. When Nina tries to describe Philip’s field she explains it as "something to do with randomness. Derandomization." It doesn’t take an expert in combinatorics to tell you that derandomization is the process of removing randomness. Interspersed throughout Nina’s memories are excerpts from Philip’s lectures, in which he explains away random occurrences with mathematical principles like the Poisson distribution. But Nina rejects his attempts to rationalize the world, to strip it of its idiosyncrasies.
Philip uses a phonetic code to remember the first 100 digits of pi. He explains that "it is useful as it turns meaningless numbers into meaningful words. Every digit is associated with a consonant sound and that is how I can remember the first hundred digits of pi." Nina’s approach is rather different. "The first 8 digits of pi would go like this: she is pregnant at 31; now, she is 41; 59 are the last two digits of Patsy’s telephone number;" and so forth. Nina embraces the random, the idiosyncratic, the apparently insignificant. In her world, ripped apart by the loss of her husband, it is all she has left.

The balance between image and text is a delicate one for comic books. The interplay of two idioms on a single page, and the assumption of a reader familiar with both, creates certain tropes and effects that appear again and again. Think of Bill Watterson’s grandest "Calvin and Hobbes" Sunday strips, or Harvey Pekar’s conversation-heavy "American Splendor." The addition of a third dimension of interplay between text and image broadens the possibilities for expression, despite—or perhaps because of—the fact that most readers have no idea what it means and must be guided in its interpretation. That is one of the triumphs of Craig Thompson’s exquisite new graphic novel "Habibi." It tells the complex story of Dodola and Zam, two escaped child slaves, who are torn apart and undergo many transformations as they grow into new names and new bodies. When they are reunited at last, love blossoms despite the obstacles. At times "Habibi" resembles an Orientalist pastiche stuffed with odalisques and eunuchs, but its scholarly reinterpretation of Abrahamic tales from the Koran turns this saga into a lush commentary on love and lust, wealth and want, religion and storytelling.
"Habibi" comes eight years after Thompson’s acclaimed autobiographical "Blankets," a nostalgic coming-of-age story about vulnerability and first love in an evangelical Christian environment. Thompson was drawn to exploring the Islamic faith after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. "I wanted to humanize it a bit and understand it, and focus on the beauty of Arabic and Islamic culture," he said in an interview with The New Statesman. "My experience of speaking to Muslims was that they weren’t any different to the Christian communities I grew up in—they had the same morals and the same lifestyles, and the same stories that shaped their religions." In "Habibi," stories drawn from the Koran are interspersed with the trials of Dodola, a young girl who is prized for her beauty despite the fact that she is also intelligent and literate, and the younger Zam, a black boy whose guilt-ridden relationship with his surrogate mother leads to devastating choices.
Thompson’s style, like his syncretic narrative, takes full advantage of the Islamic tradition of calligraphic and geometric design, blending Arabic imagery with his trademark fluid Western inking. It appears that Thompson is inspired by the masterful layout work of Will Eisner and his long-held love for Franco-Belgian comics. His intricate tale follows a rigid structure: using an Arab North African talisman, which Thompson compares to Sudoku, as the book’s framework, he divides "Habibi" into nine chapters, each with its own number, Arabic letter, and distinct visual design. This strict organization is also reflected in his frequent use of arabesques that merge and contrast with his characters’ bodies, an unusual juxtaposition of the sacred and profane, since artistic representation of bodies is considered a sin in Islam.
Combining fairy-tale imagery with realistic conceits drawn from modern times, the world of "Habibi" is a contradictory one. It features a sultan, seemingly lifted from "One Thousand and One Nights," who keeps a massive hydroelectric dam for his personal hydration needs, and a magical ship adrift in an ocean of sand dunes bordered by oil pipelines and predatory caravans. Without wading very far into contemporary issues or portrayals of Islam—in fact, without going very far beyond a thematic and artistic representation of the religion—Thompson nevertheless hints at a long history of change and upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa. This tale of eroticism, luxury, and hunger in all their forms does not lend itself to a discussion of modern political tensions; at over 670 pages, "Habibi" is already densely packed with commentary and symbolism about artistic matters. Thompson himself has said that he has no political goal or agenda, and said in a recent interview with the online magazine Guernica that he is more interested in the intersections of old and new in the developing world.
For those familiar with "Blankets," Thompson’s latest might seem like a drastic departure—and judging by covers, though one shouldn’t, the blue-and-white simplicity of his debut is overshadowed by luxurious gold trim and rich color on "Habibi." However, there are similarities: for example, Thompson has expanded the surrealistic dream sequences of "Blankets" to entire chapters, working entirely in an imaginary land called Wanatolia. However, his reliance on Orientalist tropes in "Habibi" is surprising, considering Thompson’s sensitive and insightful portrayal of Christianity in his own community in "Blankets." In interviews, Thompson has called these choices "a self-aware Orientalism," where he works within stereotypes to subvert them. But the sensitivity of his portrayal is not obvious until the book’s conclusion, a purposeful gesture that nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered. The focus of "Habibi," however, is not political or even historical; the power in this tale lies in human passion, sometimes cruel and sometimes sweet, combined with its geometric precision and deep sense of the sacred.

Laura Marling is a heartbreaker. Through heavily publicized relationships with the lead singers of Noah & the Whale and Mumford & Sons, Laura Marling had a lot of weighty emotional material to sift through on her first two solo releases. However, on her latest album, “A Creature I Don’t Know,” Marling has proven her ability to mature and expand her musical scope into more uplifting territory while still maintaining her earlier albums’ critically acclaimed passionate candor. On “Creature,” Laura Marling displays her talent at crafting poignant yet abstract lyrics, an eagerness to experiment beyond her traditional folk comfort zone with a variety of genre influences, and stunning vocals that fully accommodate her expansive emotional range.
Laura Marling  began her musical career as a 16-year-old self-recording in Britain. After playing as an original member of Noah & the Whale, she released her first solo albums, “Alas I Cannot Swim” and “I Speak Because I Can.” These albums were characterized by soulful innocence and a prevailingly dark atmosphere. The tone of her newest album marks a departure from her earlier work, with confidence and defiant perseverance pervading many of the tracks. She still plays the role of jilted lover effectively, but the music is now marked by a more hopeful delivery. In particular, the album’s  final track “All My Rage” embodies this bold optimism and empowerment through a bright, melodic blend of guitar, banjo, and beautiful vocals—“I leave my rage to the sea and the sun”—reminiscent of Joni Mitchell, to whom Marling is often compared.
Marling creates her more positive tone by means of wide-ranging musical experimentation. On the first track, “The Muse,” a jazzy melody passes between violin and piano to banjo and guitar. Although the jazz inflections could sound incongruous when played on the banjo, her unexpected move towards the genre mirrors the song’s dominant theme of searching for artistic inspiration: “Younger, ever younger, in my hunger / For a muse.” The jazz influence continues to great effect on the next track, “I Was Just A Card,” which features brass instruments that back the guitar’s jazz chords and Marling’s expressive voice. The song’s smooth, rich tones lend a feeling of assurance to its contemplative mood, and prove a welcome addition to her earlier albums’ more basic sonic palette.
Later in the album, on tracks like “The Beast,” “Salinas,” and “Sophia,” Marling incorporates melodies and staples of classic American country rock, which intensify her spirited songs. Marling uses sudden key changes to add moments of dramatic tension. She also occasionally changes the melody and instrumentation entirely at key moments to make her songs more dynamic. The first single from the album “Sophia” exhibits this prowess in its slow development from lyrical acoustic balladry into an anthemic, high-energy folk-rock climax.
Thankfully, though, the haunting beauty and compositional simplicity of Marling’s earlier work recurs in the middle of the album, where the emphasis is placed almost exclusively on Marling’s voice and lone, plaintive guitar. The spare aesthetic of tracks like “Rest in Bed” evokes misery and desolation, especially when juxtaposed with the newfound determination present on many of the album’s other songs. A sense of underlying moral indecision pervades the album, and is conveyed lyrically through recurring references to God and the devil and the overdubbing of discordant, harshly distorted electric guitars.
The lyrics of the album revolve around a rather abstract though still cohesive story of love, loss, and redemption. Marling’s poetic lyrics are rather dense, and sometimes nearly inscrutably hidden by metaphor. However, at such points the beauty of both the words and the melody easily overcome any confusion of meaning. For the most part, Marling’s message is clear, and often quite uplifting. Marling has crafted a beautiful, powerful, and poignant work. By taking the best elements of her earlier albums and imbuing them with new vitality and direction she has simultaneously avoided sacrificing any of her original charm and stagnating.

No one expected a lengthy period of silence from a band as committed to noise-making as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah (CYHSY), but after sophomore album “Some Loud Thunder,” that’s exactly what fans got. Now, after a four-year hiatus, the once-viral indie band has not only returned, but returned to form on their latest release “Hysterical.”
Based in both Brooklyn and Philadelphia, CYHSY rose to fame on the strength of their self-distributed, self-titled album. In 2005, the group signed with UK-based Wichita Recordings, and began to officially produce their brand of eclectic indie-pop. On “Some Loud Thunder,” CYHSY made a sincere effort to follow the success of their first album, but they were met with mixed reviews. On “Hysterical,” however, the lead singer Alec Ounsworth’s distinctive vocals and lyrics have evolved. The band proves as adept as ever at conjuring a joyful swarm of summertime melodies and sweeping instrumentals that are more peppy than the occasionally lugubrious and unfocused mess of “Some Loud Thunder.”
With the initial buildup of ethereal synths on top of a steady beat, “Same Mistake” starts the album on strong footing. The melody provides an easy entrance back into the world of CYHSY without overwhelming. The song does an excellent job of introducing the album’s core stylistic elements, and leaves room for the subsequent tracks to shine—“Hysterical” flows effortlessly, providing a different auditory experience with every song.
It’s no wonder that CYHSY decided to release the fourth track, “Maniac,” as a single before the album release—the track blends synth-pop with the band’s warmly embracing, idiosyncratic, and multi-layered sound. For an extremely upbeat track, the lyrics are surprisingly profound: “I miss the way you stare at me / As if I were a memory.” They prove that Ounsworth’s writing can be meaningful even within the context of music that is fun-loving and eminently danceable. Though the album’s pervasive joy often reads as a celebration of the group’s return, Ounsworth’s lyrics, while mostly inscrutable, remain marked by an eccentric pathos.
Though the group has a penchant for musical oddities—see the first track of their first album—their commitment to making effervescent music is more present than ever on “Hysterical.” Perhaps the most accessible tracks on the album are “Yesterday, Never” and “Ketamine and Ecstasy.” The former juxtaposes acoustic twang and electric guitar medleys with a background of hypnotic keyboard scales, while the latter is carried by its lively tune and repetitive, catchy chord progression. While both are irresistible, these songs indicate a dominant trend on the album away from the group’s beloved spasmodic enthusiasm towards more straightforward pop sensibilities. The tracks, however, do a good job at maintaining, if not adding to, the album’s manic energy.
On “Hysterical,” the band has refined their ballads as well as their uptempo numbers. In addition to their more fast-paced tracks, CYHSY prove capable of creating beautifully soft sounds, as evidenced by “In a Motel.” The slow swells of the violins accentuate the heartfelt melody and hauntingly sad lyrics. The song’s location on the album is perfect, following four addictive, relatively upbeat songs. The group further engages their more somber inclinations on album closer “Adam’s Plane.” At the beginning of the track, the band skillfully balances cutting piano trills with strong drums, to elegant effect. However, the song feels as though it disintegrates at the end as Ounsworth’s voice strains to overpower the crashing instrumentals.
“Hysterical” is a wonderfully self-celebrating album that signals the second coming of a band that has acquired a nearly mythical status over the years. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah seems as overjoyed about their return as their fans presumably are, and the group shows it very clearly in the predominantly cheerful tracks that do their name justice. “Hysterical” is familiar but refreshing at the same time, and as CYHSY’s first effort after their absence, it proves that even after four years’ silence, their joy is as contagious as ever.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stereo inside Harvard Book Store on Mass. Ave. is softly playing a live version of “Cowgirl in the Sand” by Neil Young. I’m chatting with the cashiers about what it’s like to work at a bookstore. “It’s wonderful—if for nothing else but the employee discount,” says a man with curly peppered hair, smiling satisfaction, presumably thinking about the bounty of books he comes home to every night. “Being surrounded at work with things I love—what more can I ask?”
Right outside, there’s an older married couple pointing and talking in low tones about the books on display in the window. I introduce myself and make acquaintance with Phil and Sue Millholland, who tell me they’re tourists from the San Francisco area. “We always come to Harvard Book Store when we’re in the neighborhood,” Phil Millholland says. “We love browsing here.” I’m an unabashed bookstore partisan, so I ask what attracts them to the habit. “I like tactile things,” Sue Millholland says. “And intimate places,” her husband adds.
I smile ruefully and nod in agreement. It’s easy to be pessimistic about the future of such delights in Harvard Square. Just this past summer, Globe Corner Bookstore and Curious George Goes to Wordsworth—both longstanding Harvard Square mainstays—closed their storefronts. Among other bookstores in the community that have closed recently are Lame Duck Books, which dealt rare and antiquarian books on Arrow Street for 25 years, and McIntyre & Moore Booksellers, which was located in Porter Square after moving from Harvard Square due to rising rent. It is not necessarily an ill that these stores are disappearing—they are simply being outmoded by more efficient technologies. While it makes sense that Harvard Square bookstore employee Kelly J. Cooper should say “It hurts so bad!” to hear about the steadily declining number of bookstores in Harvard Square, why do I agree? Are we just old fashioned and biased against change? Or is there something unsentimental in bookstores that is worth preserving?
RECOMMENDED FOR YOU
Walk into Grolier Poetry Book Shop on Plympton Street and you’ll find yourself in an unchanged 1927 interior. When Louisa Solano, Grolier’s second owner, was looking to sell the store in 2006, she required that the new owners maintain the old layout and function of Grolier completely. The store is a small, square room, and there’s barely any space to walk. The shelves reach the ceiling and overflow with volumes of poems, arranged by country of origin. Bells ring every time the door opens. When I enter, Carol Menkiti, the owner’s wife, asks me what I’m looking for. I say that I don’t know much about poetry.
“We get that a lot,” Menkiti says. “People come in and ask ‘Can you recommend something?’ Or, ‘I like this poet, could you recommend someone similar that I might like?’ And I try my best. Sometimes they ask who my favorite poet is.” The only staff member other than Menkiti and her husband Ifeany Menkiti—who is a philosophy professor at Wellesley College and a recognized poet himself—is Elizabeth Doran, the book buyer. They all double as human equivalents of Amazon’s “Recommended for You” feature.
As Menkiti talks about the history of Grolier—there’s a scrapbook in a corner of the store with newspaper clippings and photos—a customer walks in and beelines for the register to ask about a Scottish poet. Menkiti looks him up on the computer. “We only have one book by him. Do you recommend him? Should we stock more of his work?”
“I haven’t read him yet, but I’ve heard good things,” the man replies. Menkiti makes a note of it and they part ways cordially. “The people that come in are very interesting. Most of them are very enthusiastic about poetry,” Menkiti says.
COMIC NIGHTLIFE
The bookstores that still exist around Harvard rely on this symbiotic, interactive relationship between patron and store. The Million Year Picnic is a comic book store tucked into a basement space across the street from Peet’s Coffee & Tea. It’s cramped like Grolier, due in part to the criss-crossing big and small pipes that cover the ceiling. The owner of the store, Tony F. Davis ’84, is standing behind the counter. “Hey there, Joe,” Davis says. He is addressing a man in a jacket and dress pants. Joe, a longtime regular, is holding a briefcase and two A4 serial comic books, and he looks to be in his late forties. “This is the best place in the country to buy the type of things they carry,” says Joe.
Tony reaches his hand over the counter and shakes Joe’s hand affectionately.
The Million Year Picnic, which opened in Harvard Square in March 1974, is one of the oldest remaining comic book stores. The whole time I’m talking to Tony, another regular—a real-life version of the stereotypical comic-book nerd—stands around, chirping in about old Harvard Square and all its glory. They go through a short set of commercial obituaries: 24-hour eatery Tasty Sandwich Shop, Cambridge Booksmith, and WordsWorth Bookstore. He and Tony often finish each other’s sentences; each supplies names of stores when the other forgets.
The Million Year Picnic has come to rely on this dependable group of regular clientele as walk-in traffic has decreased. Davis recalls a time when Harvard Square was alive with shoppers and ramblers until late at night. “People would come to Harvard Square to go media shopping—records, books, and videos—in a two-block area, which included Million Year Picnic.” This variety of stores would bring foot traffic, causing people who didn’t know about the store to see the window display at ground level and come in for a look. Now, Davis says, the Square is inundated with service-oriented stores: nail and hair salons, restaurants, and banks. “Because these places have set hours, and usually close around 6 p.m., the streets become dead after dark.”
THE JABBERING HUB
It’s not only lack of neighboring stores that is causing problems for bookstores in Harvard Square. “People sometimes come in the store and browse, find something they like and go online to buy it,” says Heather Gain, marketing manager of Harvard Book Store. “We’re currently doing a campaign—you can see the big signs at the window of the store by the entrance—‘Find it here, buy it here, keep us here.’ We want to really send out the message before the situation gets too dire.” Online companies with warehouse storage spaces can offer cheaper prices, driving sales away from local bookstores.
This shift in conceptions of leisure is the chief force harming bookstores. “Browsing in bookstores is a leisure time activity, in the same way going to a café is,” says Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, the Director of Studies in Literature. “There was something about the way you interacted with Harvard Square [when I was a student] that had you going to bookstores and roaming the shelves and perusing the books there.”
Davis had a similar undergraduate experience—he thought that student life engaged the whole surrounding community. “Now, leisure time for students is more centered around the computer.” Without interest in the literary jabbering hub of bookstores, students see no reason not to get their reading material from online sources. At the same time, bookstores lose their most precious asset: sympathetic, learned listeners.
SELLING EXPERTISE
Any bookstore lover has to admit at least that ordering online is more convenient than going to a bookstore. “I have to confess there are times it’s a lot easier for me to order the 12 books I need online. Because there they are, and they’re discounted,” Naddaff says. “It’s not even so much the money that you save, but the convenience. Being able to—at three in the morning—to get that book.” Independent bookstores like Harvard Book Store and Schoenhof’s Foreign Books have been able to react to this need for speed by setting up online stores of their own.
It’s clear, though, that independent bookstores can’t—or shouldn’t—just be playing catch-up with the Internet. When I ask Eleni Sacre, store manager of Schoenhof’s, why people should come to the store instead of shopping online, she asks back, “Why not do both?” She is confident that the store presents an enduring worthwhile experience.
I walk down the spiral staircase to Schoenhof’s basement location and Sacre begins showing another Harvard student the variety of French-language literature books they have. Sacre’s first language is French, and she tells me that the other staff members, who proudly call themselves booksellers, speak from three to eight languages. “You can come here to talk and build relationships with booksellers, who know about books,” Sacre says, “who know how to research them.”
This expertise of all the booksellers of Schoenhof’s makes an impact on their selection. “You may find a lot of our books online, but you may not find all of them,” Sacre says. “Because some we really special order ourselves from specific editors and publishers that the public here doesn’t necessarily have access to.” Because Schoenhof’s stocks books that can be purchased only from publishers, foreign language literature professors at Harvard often set aside course books at Schoenhof’s rather than the Harvard Coop. Countless stacks of books labeled by class litter the floors of the store.
Gain brags that Harvard Book Store actually has a larger selection of books than online because of their new “book-making robot,” Paige M. Gutenborg. “Say you need ‘Hamlet’ by Shakespeare for a class that day,” Gain muses. “You can’t order it online because it won’t get to you in time, but all the stores are out of stock. Well, [Harvard Book Store] can just print one for you on the spot.” Gutenborg also provides access to books that are now out of print, as Harvard Book Store has access to databases of old editions.
SOCIETY SOPHISTICATES
These broad and expertly chosen selections may one day find themselves on the Internet. Yet the spontaneity and tradition of bookstore communities is inimitable.
Schoenhof’s, for instance, hosts foreign language events. “We had a Cambodian event not too long ago. It’s very diverse. There’s an interaction with a much broader public,” Sacre says. She even hosts “French Cafés” in the store Monday evenings at 6:30 p.m. where people from the neighborhood can get together and converse in French while drinking wine, coffee, tea, and juice. “There’s an energy [about Schoenhof’s]—it’s really an unusual place,” she says.
Harvard Book Store has an author talk practically every weekday evening, and Grolier often hosts poetry readings despite their small space. Last Saturday evening Grolier was brightly lit as both Ifeany and Carol Menkiti were mingling with a small group of patrons there to see Peter Dale Scott, a Canadian poet. Grolier radiated a warm glow, despite its having been a chilly fall day. As for The Million Year Picnic, Art Spiegelman and Craig Thompson, both critically acclaimed graphic novelists, have frequented the store for signings—and also just to check out some comics.
ABOVE RETAIL
The bookstores in the Square are assembled with the utmost care, and each are satisfying an unfulfilled need—without losing their histories and personalities. “It’s unfair to compare an independent bookstore to something like Amazon,” Sacre says. “It’s like an orange and a grapefruit. They’re both fruit, sure, but they’re very different and serve different purposes.” Bookstores aren’t just retail spaces that happen to stock books; they are neighborhood establishments that aspire to extricate passersby from their daily routines and deposit them in the world of ideas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A mecca for those involved in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies (VES), the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts serves many functions for those interested in photography, film, painting, and the like. Until October 9, the Carpenter Center is giving everyone in and out of the department an opportunity to observe the innovative work of VES visiting faculty in the temporary exhibit “Visiting Faculty 2011-2012.” Jeff T. Sheng ‘02, David Hilliard, and Amber Davis Tourlentes will be among the eight featured artists. Though small, the exhibit boasts a mélange of eclectic styles that combine to form an atypical collection, including compelling black-and-white comics, visionary short films, and striking photographs.
The comics of artist Peter A. Kuper occupy the far right corner of the exhibit. Drawn in black and white, the comics depict the short stories of renowned 20th-century novelist Franz Kafka. “Black-and-white has a quality of the time period in which the work was written,” says Kuper. “It kind of brought the work back to a period of German expressionism that seemed very appropriate for the tone of the stories.” Whether it is an entrapped mouse being devoured by a cat or a human bridge tumbling to the jagged rocks below, Kuper’s work uses the sharp contrast between shadow and light to evoke the poignant emotions characteristic of Kafka’s celebrated tales. “I found his work to have a particular dark humor to it, and I was drawn to that initially,” Kuper says.
Other pieces include Sue J. Johnson’s photographs of female boxers. The subjects of her series “Boxing Lessons” are captured in poses that range from frighteningly fierce to celebratory, and these photographs stimulate varied reactions. “It makes people uncomfortable,” Johnson says. “It is intriguing. To some, it’s sexy. Others are repelled. Whatever the response, it tends to be visceral and strong.”
The photograph of amateur boxer Camille Currie right before her match is of particular interest. As expected, her face is a mask of pure intensity. In reality, however, Currie stated that she was clearing her mind in that moment. Johnson emphasizes this contradiction between appearance and reality by printing the boxers’ quotes alongside of the photographs. “I can talk about the issues of being women and redefining what it means to be feminine or strong or how to integrate aggression,” says Johnson, “but I find that their own words convey so much more than I could ever say.” Her photographs deliver a message beyond the bounds of a female fighter’s ability; they express the potential of unadulterated feminine expression. “These women make no apologies for their aggression, violence and strength,” she says. “They own it. They are proud of it.”
Most of the other pieces in the exhibit are photographs, as well. Terah L. Maher and her collaborator Michael Langan contributed the only multimedia work. The piece is displayed on a large flatscreen TV and is composed of two short films whose novel interpretation of space and time command attention. “Choros,” the longer of the two, features Maher herself as a dancer whose figure and motions are multiplied, blurred together, and illuminated by a glowing stream of light. “We were trying to depict the feeling of a sustained moment of ecstasy,” says Maher. “All the moments of time are extended. They are sustained.” Maher and Langan use a process similar to pixilation but with the opposite effect: instead of taking still photographs and streaming pictures together to make an illusion of motion, they use techniques such as lingering, offsetting, and blending to create pauses in time.
“Visiting Faculty” is a teaser of sorts, only a sample of the talent of well respected artists who have shared their knowledge either here at Harvard or beyond. Each featured piece comes from a larger series—Kuper’s from “Metamorphosis,” Sheng’s from “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and Bright’s from “Destruction Layer.” With varied backgrounds and unique individual styles, this Carpenter Center exhibit brings together a motley crew of artists to create an original exhibit and familiarize the public with snapshots of their work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On September 15, a collection of disparate instruments crowded the Berklee College of Music Lawrence and Alma Berk Recital Hall’s stage. A group of jazz instruments stood on the left, a rock band setup occupied the right, and a collection of African drums dominated the center. Though the hall appeared to be set for three separate bands, Kina Zoré was the only group to grace the stage. Such an unusual juxtaposition of musical styles may not seem conducive to a harmonious performance; however, this combination is the definition of the style of music that the band plays.
Consisting of eight musicians from all around the world, Kina Zoré plays Mozambican Afro-pop, a genre defined by its synthesis of multiple instruments and styles. On Thursday, the band performed at Berklee for percussionist Judith Soberanes’ senior recital—a requirement for all seniors at the college. The band members are as diverse as the equipment they use; playing instruments from the trombone to the congas, and hailing from places as disparate as Los Angeles and Sudan, the band’s members merge elements of their diverse backgrounds and experiences and include various musical styles in their work.
Though the members of Kina Zoré self-proclaimedly coalesce under the genre of Afro-pop, the term is not much help in defining their musical style. An amalgamation of a number of genres—including jazz, blues, salsa, R&B, and even rock—Afro-pop encompasses music from the entire African continent. Though each country, region, and language—of which there are over 3,000—possesses its own type of music, Afro-pop uses traditional African rhythms and lyrics and melds them with Western sounds. The resulting Westernized sound creates a universality rare in many other genres.
Although sung in Ronga, a Mozambican language, Kina Zoré’s lyrics combine with a hard-hitting trumpet, smooth saxophone, tension-building bass, and native Cuban conga. The mixture creates a tropical atmosphere, which is then infused with a riffing guitar and techno-inspired keyboard melodies to form a sound that—although an arrangement of various facets of music—is similar to American popular music of today. Their music showcases the revitalized saxophone, as does Katy Perry’s “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” or Maroon 5’s “Moves Like Jagger;” employs a synthesizer on the melodia, similar to works by familiar artists like Lady Gaga and T-Pain; and share tropical roots with artists like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj as inspiration for their music. Though its lyrics are incomprehensible to most people in the United States, Kina Zoré proves that the rhythm, melody, and pitch of the song can play a big role in the music’s global connectivity and expression.
Although only two of the band members are from Africa, all eight in the ensemble have a deep respect for and interest in African music. Soberanes, of Chiapas, Mexico, loves the flexibility of the genre. “We can mix a lot of styles. We have the freedom to explore different styles in music and use electronics to synchronize everything,” she said. Not only does Soberanes love the liberty of the Afro-pop genre, she also identifies with African music: the instruments of Africa and Mexico are similar—the conga she plays is from Cuba and the djembe is of African descent, and there is a similar tropical quality present in music from both areas of the globe. This further signifies Afro-pop’s global influence and charm through its evident relatability to a myriad of cultures, genres, and countries.
Helder de Sousa Tsinine—the affable leader of Kina Zoré—composes the songs, taking immense influence from his roots in Mozambique. Tsinine came to the United States in 2007 to attend Berklee. Growing up in a musically inclined family, Tsinine used music as a positive inspiration during the strife in his homeland. From 1977 to 1992, Mozambique was overcome by a civil war that directly affected his family and, now, his music.
Tsinine’s upbeat music possesses an ulterior motive—a self-proclaimed “consciousness-raising” that lifts it past generic Afro-pop to music with a message. Tsinine introduced a song, titled “Va Gumulelana,” meaning “stop the war so that the children can grow in peace.” Another of the band’s songs, “Mupfana,” was dedicated to children whose parents have died from HIV/AIDS. Tsinine uses his country and personal history as material and projects his beliefs, desires, and memories onto his lyrics. He thus allows Kina Zoré to extend its cultural dialogue past performing music and deliver a hopeful and political message. “Our next song is called ‘Tshova Nholo.’  This means ‘never give up in life,’” he said toward the middle of the set. “Whatever you do, just follow your heart and never give up.”

Jeff T. Sheng ’02 is a visiting lecturer in Visual and Environmental Studies and a nationally acclaimed photographer. His work fuses art and activism; he first garnered attention for a series on BGLTQ student athletes. His portraits of military personnel affected by the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy were displayed in Washington, D.C. in the weeks before the policy’s repeal. Sheng will give a talk about his work on Thursday at 6 p.m. in the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts.
The Harvard Crimson: When did you know photography was your medium of choice?
Jeff Sheng: I was a [Visual and Environmental Studies (VES)] concentrator here at Harvard, and I started photography in my first year in the fall. It was supposed to be an elective, and I wound up falling in love with it and pursuing it as my concentration.
THC: Why photography–what is special about that form for you?
JS: I like this idea that photography freezes time and shows both truth and, arguably, non-truth. The perspective of the person making the image is infused in what’s seen. I enjoy working alone, being on the road and examining society with my camera, and documenting what’s around me. My work is very sociological and ethnographical—I’ve been photographing these individuals who are part of communities, particularly the [BGLTQ] community, but who are not recognized, however you want to interpret that. The image allows me to bring their individualism out to the forefront to be seen.
THC: Which of your projects makes you most proud?
JS: I find them equally engaging for me in different ways. I speak at a lot of high schools and colleges and corporations … I’ve become really proud of the way I can integrate my photography with something that is engaging on a different level than just the visual image. But with ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’—the timing [was not intentional]. It was 2009, nobody had really thought about the policy being repealed, and I just thought it was important. I happened to coincide with this moment in 2010 where the president and Congress were finally signaling an end to it.
THC: Many of your works deal with political and social issues. Do you consider them more political statements or aesthetic works?
JS: I don’t know if they need to be separated to such a degree that we currently demand them to be. I think that there’s a very persistent line of thought in the art world that art had its political moment before but now should be devoid of any political statement. I don’t understand people who continuously rally against any political work. But at the same time, I think there’s also a very fine line between academia and politics that feels that art is soft or fluffy or decorative, and they don’t place value in the visual arts as a medium that can direct politics. I think both are integrated to a degree that we haven’t fully realized yet. … I see it when I try to enter the art world fully as a legitimized artist. I think sometimes people look at my work and think it’s not art, or when I apply to … grants, they look at art as not as worthy of, say, a research grant or some sociological study grant. It’s stuff that you battle.
THC: Do you have any thoughts regarding the kinds of projects you’d like to do in the future?
JS: I’m gathering participants and ideas [for] something around teen suicide. I haven’t figured it out yet, but I approach every project like this—you have a spark of an idea, and you begin it … I’ve gotten a couple [emails] as I’ve floated this idea around, and the sort of depth of trauma that these people have experienced as teenagers, in regards to coming out or their sexuality or being harassed and bullied, is so—I leave my office just feeling completely overwhelmed by it.
THC: You’re also a visiting VES professor–what draws you to teaching?
JS: One, you are with very intelligent students; two, you are with very intelligent faculty members; and three, you’re tied to an institution. So what I love about it is the interplay of ideas and inspiration and motivation. I can see the successes of colleagues of mine and feel, ‘Wow, I aspire to that level of success,’ and then see students who feel so engaged with what you’re telling them and want to learn from you. Maybe I see a part of myself from 10, 15 years ago, and that’s lovely to just be a part of.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is rare for a musician to continually evolve over almost 20 years, but on “Night of Hunters,” Tori Amos refuses to repeat herself. She has transformed her style, and she incorporates distinctive compositions and showcasing her skills as an innovative songwriter. She maintains her trademark ethereal vocals and cryptic, pointed lyrics throughout “Night of Hunters,” yet also reaches beyond her established sound. The risks she takes are often successful, but some may be off-putting for those who are accustomed to her older work.
“Night of Hunters” is the work of an accomplished musical architect known for building disparate musical elements into grander wholes. On a few of her more successful tracks, Amos layers her poignant lyrics over samples of classical pieces by the likes of Johann Sebastian Bach and Frédéric Chopin. Album opener “Shattering Sea” executes this uncommon mélange impeccably in a compelling, energetic vocal concerto. However, the spotlight shifts noticeably to the instruments on other tracks of “Night of Hunters,” making the album play more like the score of a dramatic film than the work of a singer-songwriter. At times, vocals even seem more like an afterthought than an integral factor. “Seven Sisters,” the only all-instrumental track, feels complete with a perfect meld of classical piano melodies and cheery woodwind tunes. “Snowblind,” “Fearlessness,” and “Star Whisperer” all consist of instrumentals that evoke more emotion than the lyrics do. Each of these songs builds upon one another, and reflects the rising action of the story, which culminates in the theatrical climax of the titular track. “Night of Hunters” is an intricate, swirling triumph ending in operatic vocal harmonies. “Carry,” the final song, is a solemn dénouement during which broken piano chords bring the vigor of all its predecessors down to a beautiful, lulling conclusion.
Though there are moments of impeccable instrumentation, the album relies too heavily on repetitive tropes. Piano introductions feature prominently on almost every track, and this overuse mars the album with predictability. However, Amos’s frequent use of melodic woodwinds and soothing cellos adds more versatility and emotional depth to the music, and lifts it back up to a caliber comparable to that of Amos’ previous work. “Battle of Trees,” one of the record’s standout tracks, includes light pizzicato notes on the violin that tread softly beneath Amos’ floating vocals and the cello’s harmonic double stops. On this track, Amos’s idiosyncratic allusions to the Celtic Tree Calendar in a love song perfectly complement—and are not overshadowed by—the equally whimsical instrumentals. “Fearlessness” includes a cello for rich, foundational support under resonant deep notes in the ubiquitous piano interludes and a buoyant flute.
Perhaps one of the stranger aspects of this album is that four of its tracks feature Natashya Lorien Hawley, Amos’s 11-year-old daughter. Hawley’s voice has the same unassuming quality as her mother’s, but with throatier vibrato and more youthful mainstream appeal. The tone of her voice is still primarily rooted in adolescent naïveté but she takes on mature premises that stretch far beyond her years—“There is a grid of disempowerment / Our forces are being called to dismantle this”—with the poise of a professional, and specifically that of her mother. In “The Chase,” a musical dialogue between the two vocalists, Amos weaves in moral wisdom and shares her musical expertise with her daughter. In these songs, the attention paid to the vocals makes the tracks all the more engaging, and hints at what Amos could have accomplished were her vocals not merely supplemental to her elaborate orchestration.
“Night of Hunters,” an inimitable blend of vocal arrangements, orchestral scoring, and spiritual homage to nature—as on “Battle of Trees,” “Shattering Sea,” and “Cactus Practice”—is characterized by calculated, rewarding risks that demonstrate Amos’s innovation, songwriting ability, and skills as a mentor. Though her adventurous incorporation of classical motifs comes at the expense of a more traditional songwriting prowess, Amos makes a significant achievement in composing an album that effectively uses chamber music as a tool relevant to the times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Back to Boston” was the alliterative theme of the evening at the Middle East Upstairs this past Sunday night. The show sought to bolster the Boston art community by presenting a marriage of the visual arts and live music, scenes. Three Boston-based artists, Valera Velev, Sara M.A. Holbert,  William Holbert, had pieces of original artwork hanging on the walls of the performance space. Throughout the evening, The La De Les, Sounds of Venus, Noize Tank, and Colour—four Boston-based bands—performed live.
The Middle East Upstairs is vastly different from most student-friendly Boston venues, such as the House of Blues or Bank of America Pavilion. The unassuming space is comprised of a small stage and an area that accommodates about 200 people. There are no strobe lights or fog machines, and no barriers between the crowd and stage—just a space to perform and a space to listen.
Musicians, artists, and audience members mingled before the show began, and it was this sort of camaraderie that made the notion of a cohesive “arts scene” in Boston seem plausible. Event organizer and Berklee College of Music business major Nicholas A. Susi, who also performed as part of Sounds of Venus, talked about wanting to help build a more vibrant art scene and community in Boston. “I stayed in Brooklyn with my girlfriend’s cousin last winter, and there’s this great, creative artistic culture in New York, with art openings going on all the time. People show up at those kinds of events and they’re there solely for the art. I feel like there’s nothing like that going on in Boston,” said Susi.
“Back to Boston” embraced an all-inclusive notion of art. Local original artwork lined the walls of the space. Early visitors inspected the hanging art as they waited for the first band, The La De Les, to take the stage. Sara M.A. Holbert’s beautifully melancholy portraits of small, fragile-looking girls hung next to her husband William Holbert’s pop-art pieces—intriguing hybrids of elements from comic books and his own coloration. Both Holberts are relative newcomers to the Boston art scene, having recently moved here from the Midwest. “This event is really my first taste of the Boston visual arts scene, and the first time I was able to combine my musical side and my visual art,” said Sara Holbert. Indeed, she showcased both skills, drumming with her band The La De Les to an audience who could easily turn and peruse her artwork. The room also featured Valera Velev’s striking “Fizz” piece—a large, dynamic swirl of color with wildly unique texture due to a creative use of expanding foam and house paints.
The music proved an enlivening aural companion to the artwork. The La De Les played first, and the room’s atmosphere immediately swung from clamoring crowd noise to the blaring feedback of guitars. The  La De Les channel Portugal. The Man and Explosions in the Sky through their heavy use of dynamic shifts, steadfast, prominent drums, and haunting harmonies. Sounds of Venus followed, filling the small space with their sensual vocal melodies and smooth instrumental work. The third band, Noize Tank, completely changed the pace of the evening by blasting the crowd with waves of distortion, chugging breakdowns, and formidable power chords. The final act of the evening, Colour, rounded everything off beautifully with their earnest, bluesy rock. The diversity of musical acts effectively mirrored the wide variety of artwork.
The crowd loved every act, and bounced with rambunctious energy during fast songs, and fervently nodding along to the less aggressive numbers. An audience member, Ryan K. Stewart, spoke about how much he enjoyed the show: “It’s nice to go to these low-key venues where you can hear great bands you would otherwise miss.” Jocelyn Nicolas, one of the vocalists for The La De Les, summed up her feelings for the event. “For us, this event wasn’t just about making lots of fans or money, we were here with people we love to put out our own art and appreciate others,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an April 2008 presidential debate between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, moderator Charlie Gibson pointed out that both times the capital gains tax had been cut in the past two decades, revenue had increased, and that it had gone down when the tax was raised in the 1980s. Despite this, then-candidate Obama said he would “look at” raising the capital gains tax “for purposes of fairness,” lamenting the injustice of an economy that allowed the top 50 hedge fund managers to earn $29 billion in 2007.
In other words, we have a President who is willing to raise taxes, even if it means lower revenues, for the sake of reducing the income of the rich. This class warfare mentality is reflected in the rhetoric he has used to defend certain tax provisions of the American Jobs Act that he introduced a couple of weeks ago. By insisting that certain segments of the population are not paying their “fair share,” President Obama is perpetuating an unfortunate focus on taking from the haves rather than helping the have-nots.
The jobs bill is certainly not without merit. For one thing, it contains a sensible proposal to limit the ability of high-income taxpayers to take deductions. Thanks in large part to administrative costs that accompany tax exemptions, the National Taxpayer Advocate estimates that Americans spent $163 billion in 2008 to comply with the tax code’s requirements. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein has argued that reform of the kind included in the bill would raise revenue while lowering compliance costs and avoiding the unpleasant behavioral effects of higher tax rates.
Of course, the bill would largely negate this by adding several new tax expenditures, and discouraging capital investment by raising the tax rate on profits earned by general partners of long-term investment partnerships. But what is concerning from a political perspective is how the President has advertised these proposals. In his September 8 address to Congress and several speeches thereafter, he has not focused on the huge efficiency gains to be made from reducing the complexity of the tax code, or the virtue of raising revenue without the adverse effects of a tax rate increase. Instead, he has lamented tax breaks for “millionaires and billionaires,” whom he defines as individuals making over $200,000. At the same time, he has complained that most people in the country must “struggle to make ends meet” while the wealthy “enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets.”
No doubt the wealthy live comfortably and benefit disproportionately from tax exemptions, but to suggest, as the President has, that they are not paying their “fair share” is to betray either an ignorance of the federal tax structure or an extreme conception of fairness. In 2008, the top one percent of taxpayers, who earned a fifth of the country’s adjusted gross income, paid 38 percent of federal individual income taxes. The top five percent contributed 58.7 percent of these taxes—far more than the bottom 95 percent. A call for these citizens to pay even more should at the very least be accompanied by an acknowledgment of how much they are paying already.
Among the wealthy, the President has targeted a couple of groups in particular. One is the oil industry, whose profitability he has decried since at least 2007 when he advocated a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Another is corporate jet owners. In a press conference last June, he took six separate swings at private flyers, suggesting at one point that the nation needed to choose between tax breaks for jet owners and the safety of children.
True to form, the Jobs Act would phase out several deductions for the oil and gas industry, and repeal the bonus depreciation deduction for those purchasing corporate jets. These measures would generate $43 billion in new revenue over the next decade, out of a projected deficit of about $3.5 trillion. Something is better than nothing, but why is President Obama singling out two small provisions in a tax code replete with carve-outs for diverse industries and activities? It could be that White House economists painstakingly scoured federal tax policy and determined that these two adjustments were the best way to raise revenue with minimal efficiency reduction. More likely is that President Obama is leveraging the unpopularity of corporate jet owners and the oil industry to push his agenda at their expense.
Even assuming the President’s proposals have salutary economic effects, the fact that he is selling them by stirring up envy among working class citizens is disturbing. There is a strong case that the rich should pay more, but it should be made by illustrating how such a proposal would serve the interests of the nation as a whole, while acknowledging the significant contributions high-income earners have already made. In a time when prominent voices have warned of civil unrest if the economy does not improve, an attempt by the President of the United States to pit the poor against the rich is unhelpful at best.

Founded in 1882, the esteemed Harvard Cooperative Society—“the Coop” for short—has been a fixture of scholarly life here for almost 130 years. As its name suggests, the Coop began as a business jointly owned by all those who paid the $1 membership fee. Of course, the Coop’s business model has changed substantially since then—it no longer grants those who pay the membership fee ownership in the company. Remarkably, however, it maintains the mission of “serv[ing] the Harvard and MIT communities as a cooperative by providing quality products and services.”
As is well known, the price of books at the Coop has become prohibitive for more and more students each year, and ever-increasing droves are turning to low-cost providers such Amazon.com for course materials. Either the Coop must find a way to reclaim its mission by providing books at prices competitive with other providers, or it must dispel the widespread myth that it remains a genuinely cooperative business.
After all, to be a “cooperative” means something specific, that those who own the business are those who work there or patronize it. Today’s Coop, however, does not reflect this definition at all. The membership one buys for $1 is, in reality, a customer loyalty program, which promises an eight to ten percent rebate for all purchases made there. Unfortunately, many students still operate under the assumption that to pay the $1 fee is to be a joint owner of the Coop, which is simply not the case.
The particular business model of the Coop is especially relevant because many students are willing to pay the extra cost of a book there because the establishment is seen as beholden to them. If, however, one realizes that the Coop is no more obligated to its “members” than is Amazon.com, much of the perceived incentive to pay its high prices ceases to exist.
Currently, some books, like Professor N. Gregory Mankiw’s “Principles of Economics” are offered for almost $100 less on Amazon.com than they are at the Coop. Certainly, the Coop has to pay expensive overhead costs that online retailers simply don’t have to consider, and we understand that the circumstances are different. That said, if the business’s aim is truly to be “cooperative” with students—as its mission statement states—it must consider alternative methods to offer competitively priced books. To be fair, the Coop has tried implementing some measures this year to do just that—the option to rent textbooks, for instance, allows students to pay less for a book they can keep and use for a semester. But this is hardly enough, and the “cooperative” should seriously consider finding more ways to remain true to its mission.
Furthermore, if the Coop can’t keep up with its competitors, the College should reconsider its special relationship with the bookseller, which currently allows the Coop to sell required course books all in one place. Such a practice only allows the Coop to charge comparatively high prices, since students often resort to the convenience of one-stop shopping as opposed to book-hunting on Amazon.com. And if the costs of one-stop shopping at the Coop weren’t clear before, consider the recent incident just last week of the Coop overcharging by $54.20 for the “American Constitutional Law” textbook. Although customers were promised refunds, the mishap only further confirms that Coop doesn’t seem all that concerned with keeping students’ best interests at heart.
As the recent bankruptcy of Borders Group, Inc. demonstrates, it’s difficult to succeed as a bricks-and-mortar book retailer these days. Nevertheless, the Coop—as long as it continues considers itself a “cooperative”—is responsible for upholding its mission of providing affordable, quality goods and services to the Harvard (and MIT) community.
As students, we have no obligation to patronize the Coop whatsoever, and neither does the College have an obligation to give it a competitive advantage through the special relationship that continues to exist between the two. Whether it be through an increasing online presence or some other method, we urge the Coop to bring down its prices so it can become the trustworthy companion of the Harvard Undergraduate once more

President Obama believes the passage of the America Invents Act is an example of Congressional action that should be emulated in the future. In his recent address to a joint session of Congress he spoke of the act in glowing terms, applauding legislators for having "passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible," calling it "the kind of action we need." He signaled his approval for the new law when he signed it into law on the morning of September 16th.
While the patent system is failing in many areas, the America Invents Act (AIA), despite Obama’s glowing praise, does little to fix the most pertinent issues currently facing our country's process of protecting and tracking intellectual property. Rather, it only serves to further derail the effectiveness with which patent requests are dealt. Upon a close examination, the President's advice on using the AIA as a model of legislative action seems misguided. Congress would do well to only use the AIA as an example of how not to pursue future reform.
The most crucial problem currently facing the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is its backlog of patent applications. On average, it currently takes between two and three years for American inventors to have their patent applications processed. Beth Noveck, formerly the U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer and leader of the White House Open Government Initiative, succinctly summarized the problem when she commented that "The backlog has reached Borgesian proportions, and it feeds on itself: The patent examiner has less time to review more applications. Reviews become less rigorous. The easier the application process becomes, the more inventors apply." The inability of the USPTO to efficiently process patent applications is a key obstacle on the road to economic recovery. Inventors who would otherwise start groundbreaking small businesses are stuck in limbo.
The AIA targets this issue by creating a "first-to-file" rule—one where a patent for an invention is granted to whomever is the first to file their application with the office. This is very different from the current system, which follows a "first-to-invent" rule. Up till now, inventors who did not receive a patent had the opportunity to prove they conceived of the invention at an earlier point than whomever was awarded the patent. As long as the petitioning inventor also proved their diligence in filing an application, they got the rights to the patent. With the President’s signature on the AIA, this appeal process no longer exists. The "first-to-file" rule completely dispenses with justice in the service of efficiency. In the process of passing this bill, legislators ensure that only massive corporations who have the resources of patent lawyers readily at their disposal will be able to quickly acquire patents, since they will be able to outrace entrepreneurs and basement inventors to the patent desk.
The question remains as to how legislators should have approached fixing the patent system. An ideal system would reduce the USPTO's backlog without sacrificing either the quality or justice of the review process. Dan Rivicher, executive director of the Public Patent Foundation, mentions limiting the scope of patent law as an effective deterrent to piles of unread applications. After all, much of the USPTO's time is currently spent on applications that are rejected for reasons of unfeasibility. What Rivicher doesn't mention is that the most effective way to limit the scope of patent law is not to change the patent itself, but rather the application process. In an essay recently published in Wired magazine, journalist Brendan Koerner proposed just such a solution. Koerner quotes Mario Biagioli ,  a Professor of Law and Science and Technology at UC Davis Law School, as saying "The requirements to patent have become, in my humble view, a joke."
Koerner discusses an idea so simple that Congress had already used it in the 19th century.  By merely having inventors submit a physical prototype of their idea, the USPTO could eliminate a wide range of patent applications for inventions which have insufficient real-world research backing their conception. This requirement is not a far-fetched idea. A look at recent patent data reveals that inventions without a material focus, such as those of business models and drug compositions, make up less than ten percent of the application pool. Instituting a qualitative and tangible benchmark for the more than 90 percent of remaining applications is a quick way to cut through the backlog without compromising the functionality of the USPTO. This would require inventors to do more work at the outset in order to create working models of their conceptions, but such efforts would be necessary regardless; especially if they planned to create a business around their idea. Unlike the AIA, such a requirement would not put corporations and individuals on an unequal footing in the legal context of claiming intellectual property. It also would not compromise the integrity of the patent review process. Rather, it would delegate responsibility for assuring the feasibility of an invention in a manner that is efficient and ethical for all concerned
Achievements of American ingenuity all share the inspired thought that inventors put into their design. From Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs, most inventors have recognized that the world changes for the better only when people carefully reflect on the best way to translate ideas into reality. If our legislators had put some effort and creativity into their creation of the America Invents Act, perhaps they could have called themselves inventors of something more than the status quo.

Lincoln said in 1863 that those present at the commemoration of Gettysburg must “highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” His speech did not only memorialize, it also galvanized—for in November of 1863, America was at war with itself. The North needed a shared cause as much as it needed shared remembrance.
September 11th was not Gettysburg. The soldiers Lincoln eulogized were not civilians; Civil War adversaries were better-defined and perhaps better understood than those in a war of terror. Yet Lincoln borrowed a somber occasion and imposed an argument, that these soldiers died for democracy. Not all of them did; no army is built of unanimous motives. But few today fault him for claiming it nonetheless.
For some reason, though, what we note easily at Gettysburg—that Lincoln’s speech was political, and rightfully so—we refuse to laud in the case of Harvard’s 9/11 vigil. The remembrance of Sept. 11, we pretend, is apolitical.
But a vigil is a political act. I do not mean it serves the interests of a party or a doctrine. Rather, it counters suffering—by insisting that we present have not allowed these dead to go unmarked, and these atrocities to go unresisted. A vigil is built of political human beings, who hold opinions and, by acting on them, hope to attack the sources of suffering. That suffering was deeply political on Sept. 11, 2001, for it was directed at the beating civilian heart of this country and its values. We ignore all of this if we aim for an apolitical dream, made impotent by political correctness.
There has been much discussion of the vigil’s politicism in this publication. One writer echoed the arguments of a Crimson Staff Editorial when he said that “this vigil was primarily about promoting the narrative of rampant Islamophobia after 9/11.” However, Islamophobia was a central theme of none of the speakers and comprised a small fraction of the speeches. Furthermore, Islamophobia is itself a manifestation of the suffering which a vigil presumes to address in the first place.
But even if the dissenters are correct, their critiques of Harvard’s “political vigil” say something about all of us. They remind us that we hunt for culprits among our friends as well as among our enemies. The Crimson Staff Editorial offered the sweeping suspicion that “the Harvard community” (used synonymously with “the day’s organizers”) was deliberately using “the anniversary primarily as a means of decrying post-9/11 discrimination in America and the subsequent foreign policy of the Bush administration.”
If we are to lay blame, let us be precise. “The day’s organizers” who planned the evening vigil were distinct from those who, in facilitating separate intellectual discussions, supposedly insisted upon “their, and Harvard’s, own steadfast commitment to multiculturalism.” The vigil planners included a Harvard assistant dean, four speakers—a scholar of religion, the Chaplain of our University, the Dean of our College, and the daughter of a man who died in the World Trade Center—and a few students. I was one of them, but I speak only for myself.
It is this group that we are accusing of orchestrating an inappropriately political commemoration. If a political agenda exists among the diverse speakers and planners of Harvard’s vigil, I do not know who authored it. But The Crimson editorial staff felt justified in criticizing that “author,” with all the restraint of a negative book review (its title was “Call That a Vigil?”).
The evidence used by critics of the vigil has been imprecise, perhaps because they were trying to critique a unitary agenda that did not exist. The recitation from the Koran was not, as The Crimson staff editorial claimed, “the only religious text read at the vigil.” The University Choir sang from the Hebrew Bible (“Song of Solomon”) and Revelation 14:13. Student Elizabeth Moroney, whose father died on 9/11, did not say that Americans “should have been ‘trying to understand’ the people who attacked us.” She said Americans “should be trying to understand rather than trying to be understood.”
The criticisms of the vigil should remind us that people prefer a locus for their frustration and blame. We like to imagine that someone orchestrated a controversial political stance, instead of acknowledging that these separate speakers responded separately to the injustices they perceived in 9/11. If the speakers were political, it was because of an accurate realization: that all the candles we might burn at an ‘apolitical’ vigil can shed light on nothing but the tears on our faces.
The other thing Lincoln said at Gettysburg is that “[t]he world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what [the dead] did here.” We need not be afraid that any orator’s words can taint our commemoration of the dead. It is for us the living to try to speak, politically when we feel we must.

A projector screen hanging in CGIS-S250 offered a window Monday evening into an oft-overlooked aspect of 20th century Korean culture.
The Korea Institute presented “Bungee Jumping of Their Own,” the first of five films screening as part of the Institute’s Korean Cinematheque program titled “Male Affections: Re-Gendering Korean Masculinity.”
Sponsored by the Academy of Korean Studies, the annual program shows Korean films and hosts group discussions to foster a better understanding of Korean culture on campus.
This year, the program is screening contemporary Korean films that deal with men who struggle to fit into rapidly changing definitions of masculinity.
The masculine ideal in the 1970s was a militarized figure, said Professor Carter J. Eckert, who is chair of Korean Cinematheque. But since South Korea’s democratization in the 1990s, “it’s a different world” for masculine identity in Korean society.
“The ambiguity of masculinity is still being debated today,” said Assistant Professor of English Ju Yon Kim, the guest speaker for the event.
“Bungee Jumping of Their Own” portrays protagonist Seo In-Woo’s struggles with his attraction to a male high school student who reminds him of his first female love.
It was the first mainstream Korean film to deal with questions of sexual orientation, said Dima David Mironenko-Hubbs, the event coordinator for the Korea Institute.
“It was like the ‘Brokeback Mountain’ of Korean cinema,” he said.
The group discussion held after the showing explored how Korean society reacted with hostility to Seo In-Woo’s perceived homosexuality.
Although South Korea is a modernized country, it is still very conservative, Mironenko-Hubbs said. The films and the group discussions will shed light on a topic that many Koreans refuse to discuss, he said, but also a topic relevant to America.
“There’s a famous quote that goes something like, ‘By learning about other cultures, we learn about ourselves,’” said Mironenko-Hubbs. “The films help us understand Korean culture and the culture here.”
The Korean Cinematheque will feature the films “Road Movie” on Oct. 17, “The King and the Clown” on Oct. 24, “No Regret” on Nov. 14, and “Like a Virgin” on Nov. 28. Screenings begin at 4 p.m. in CGIS-S250.

Music is giving voice to minorities and the poor in Cuba, according to Nora Gámez Torres, a doctoral student at the Department of Sociology at City University in London.
Reggaeton—which often combines heavy beats, rapping, and Latin American rhythms—serves as a means of bringing the issues of the “underclass” in Cuba to the global stage, Torres said before the Harvard’s Cuban Studies Program on Monday afternoon.
The seminar examined what Torres, who is originally from Havana, characterized as the media’s hesitation to cover the poor in Cuba and how reggaeton artists use their music to express political dissatisfaction.
Torres said that the rising popularity of reggaeton in Cuba has seen backlash from some members of the Cuban government, who say that it is “capitalistic” in nature. Torres noted that some politicians point to reggaeton’s Puerto Rican roots as a means of deeming it unpatriotic. But she said that it is the message of the music that Cuban government officials truly dislike.
As the music is written in Cuba but produced in foreign countries, reggaeton artists have found a way to voice their concerns with the national political climate away from the pressures of the government, Torres said.
Still reggaeton artists are trying to make their art more palatable to Cuban culture, according to Torres. She mentioned one artist, Baby Lores, who had Fidel Castro’s image tattooed on his arm and subsequently wrote a song praising Cuba’s former Prime Minister and revolutionary war hero.
Musically, reggaeton artists have tried to write songs that are more in line with traditional Cuban music, responding to complaints from an older generation of musicians, who noted that the genre relies heavily on beats and sounds created from computer effects. As a result, reggaeton musicians have emphasized the vocal elements of their style, according to Torres.
At first Torres said she had a very negative reaction to the genre, but her opinion shifted after her nephew became a reggaeton producer and took her to a concert. Torres said her nephew told her “with this I can create something new,” noting that the novelty of the genre allowed him creative freedom. Torres said that her doctoral study was inspired by this experience.
The seminar was the first in a series of upcoming seminars this year that deal primarily with contemporary Cuban society and the history of the arts there. The seminars are open to the public and are organized by the Cuban Studies Program, which is a part of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. Linda M. Rodriguez, the fellow in charge of the Cuban Studies Program, organized the seminar.
Rodriguez noted that Torres’ study of reggaeton as a means of giving voice to the disenfranchised “makes the contours of change in Cuba more visible.”

Panelists at an Institute of Politics forum on Monday praised the grassroots nature of the Arab uprisings that began earlier this year but cautioned against making premature predictions about the protests’ trajectory.
The forum, called “Inside the Arab Awakening,” brought together four international experts on the Middle East and was co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School Middle East Initiative.
HKS Professor R. Nicholas Burns moderated the panel and began the forum by asking whether the name “Arab Spring,” as the uprising has commonly been called in the media, was an adequate name for the movement.
Panelists agreed that “Arab Spring” was insufficient, preferring to refer to the upheaval as an “uprising” or “revolt.”
“The reason I call it [an uprising] is because I don’t think it’s just a temporary series of protests, I think it’s going to be a long struggle,” said Diana Buttu, a Dubai Initiative Research Fellow at HKS and former spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization.
“There’s something that’s broader in scope that involves rising up against the status quo,” Buttu said.
From the outset of the discussion, the panelists acknowledged that the uprisings were still too recent to draw conclusions about the ultimate outcomes.
“I wouldn’t upgrade [the unrest] to a revolution just yet,” said Dr. Karim Makdisi, an associate professor at the American University of Beirut.
“Revolution, academically, is a term that needs to be developed more fully,” he said.
Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy and International Affairs at the American University of Beirut, drew historical parallels to the American Revolution to underscore the point that revolutions take a long time to result in stable changes.
“Remember, this is a long-term event. The American uprisings that began in 1775 continued ... until African Americans and later women got the vote,” Khouri said.
But he also asserted that this is undoubtedly a historic moment for both the Middle East and the rest of the world.
“I would say this is the most significant development since the birth of the modern Arab state-system. This is the first time that you have had across this region a process of self-determination created by the Arab citizens who are demanding that they have the right to form policy, define their government system, and define their national values,” Khouri said.

Approximately 30 students and members of Service Employees International Union Local 615, the union which represents Harvard custodial workers, marched from Au Bon Pain to Radcliffe Gymnasium before the first day of contract negotiations began Monday.
Workers shouted rallying cries as they went, chanting phrases such as “Si se puede!” (Yes we can) and “No contract, no peace!”
Leaders of SEIU said that the purpose of the march was to raise awareness about the contract negotiations, as well as to present a strong, united front to the University.
“We will stand together against injustice,” said Nancy Diaz, a member of the bargaining committee for SEIU. “They can’t knock us down.”
Diaz said that the union’s primary concerns going into negotiations are better salaries and full-time employment.
“Full-time employment is very important because it puts an end to split shifts,” she said. “When you are working in the morning, then coming back to work at night, there is not time to spend with family.”
Diaz said that another top priority for the SEIU bargaining committee will be increasing opportunity for career mobility based on seniority.
“Workers who have been there longer deserve more respect,” Diaz said. “Respect for seniority gives people the opportunity to better their work, to get a better job.”
Dean Phane, a Harvard custodial worker in the union, said that the committee is focused on making sure that the University does not take away any of the privileges workers have already won.
“We worry about Harvard letting the custodial department carry the burden of the economy,” Phane said. “Shops don’t tell us we can have a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk for half price because the economy is bad. We need fair wages and benefits.”
He added that while he believes the University is generally a good employer, he thinks they “could be better.”
“They’re not respecting the workers right now,” he said. “That needs to change.”
Students who marched with the workers said they want University employees to know they have student support.
“The employees here make up an extremely important part of the Harvard community,” said Calvin Tonini ’15. “They are a reflection of the Harvard community, and the Cambridge and Allston communities.”
After the negotiations, union bargaining committee members said that they were pleased with how the first day went.
“It was a good start,” said Director of Higher Education for SEIU Local 615 Wayne M. Langley. “I think we’ll have some really good, thorough negotiations.”
The University also said it expects mutually beneficial negotiations.
The University said it anticipates a mutually beneficial round of contract negotiations.
“We are looking forward to a round of contract talks that we hope will be productive for both the University and the people who help to make it one of the world’s premier institutions for research and education,” said University spokesperson Kevin Galvin.

Over 200 Harvard security guards signed a petition affirming that they are willing to strike if key issues are not resolved during the ongoing contract negotiations.
Guards submitted the petition to their union representatives Monday at a small gathering in front of the Holyoke Center. Over 80 percent of the security guards at the University signed the petition.
The threat of a strike comes after Securitas, the private contractor which employs security guards for the University, introduced a new health care proposal going into the last week of contract negotiations.
Union leaders said that the new health care plan is much worse than the one already in place and that they want the plan taken off the table.
The University has said in the past that it will not comment on contract negotiations with Securitas.
“I commend the security guards for their courage,” said Wayne M. Langley, the director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union which represents Harvard security guards. “We deserve the right to health care, we earned the right to health care, and we should fight for it.”
Langley also emphasized the importance of unity in combatting the proposed plan.
“Together we are strong,” he said. “Together, we can accomplish our goals.”
Matthew Gulish, an organizer for SEIU, said that Monday’s demonstration was just the beginning, and that union members and supporters of the security guards would be demonstrating their support in front of the Holyoke Center twice a day for the rest of the week.
“There will be people holding signs and showing support,” he said. “We are going to show support all the way through the negotiations.”
Gulish said that the union will continue to rally around this issue until the security guards are presented with an acceptable contract.
“It’s important for workers to have a fair wage and good benefits,” Gulish said. “And it’s important that we show our support as workers try and go after these issues.”
Students also featured prominently in the event. Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14—a member of The Crimson’s editorial board and a member of the Student Labor Action Movement—said she believes that students will support whatever course of action security guards decide to take, including a strike.
“On behalf of all the students of Harvard, I want you to know that your fight is our fight,” she said. “If you want to picket, rally, or even strike, we’re here behind you all the way.”
Betty Maitland, a member of the union’s bargaining committee who symbolically accepted the petition during the demonstration, said that the union is dedicated to winning the battle on health care, no matter what it takes.
“We intend to fight this right to the end and strike if necessary to preserve our health care,” Maitland said. “We have more signatures on the petition all the time.”
While the petition to strike is largely a result of the new proposed health care plan put forward by Securitas, Local 615 is also pushing Securitas on other issues, such as full-time work.
Securitas could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One month after Kevin A. McCluskey ’76 stepped down from his post as senior director of community relations for Harvard, the position has yet to be filled, leaving a gap in communication between Allston residents and the University.
Harvard is in the midst of finalizing plans for developing its properties in Allston, three months after the Harvard Allston Work Team submitted its recommendations for moving forward in the neighborhood.
University officials say that a broad network led by three primary liaisons—Kevin Casey, Annie Tomasini, and Mary-Helen Black, all from Harvard Public Affairs and Communications—has taken up McCluskey’s former duties.
They say they have listened to Allston residents and helped incorporate their suggestions into the University’s plans for future development in the neighborhood.
Casey, the University’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said that during summer Task Force meetings he told residents that they could contact him and other Harvard officials to voice their concerns.
“We view [McCluskey’s] role as an important one in our organization, which we want to take real care in [filling],” said Casey. “In the meantime we want to keep the transition smooth with the people that folks have been used to working with at City Hall, in the community, and in our elected delegation.”
Officials highlighted workforce training programs and monthly coffee hours in the Allston Education Portal as resources designed to connect with residents.
But Allston residents say these initiatives are not enough.
They complain that direct communication with Harvard has never existed, even before McCluskey’s departure, and they criticize the University for not working side-by-side with community members.
“The real question is, will Harvard ever decide that it wants to work with the community in a joint decision process?” said Harvard Allston Task Force member Brent Whelan ’73. He said that no community members were part of the Harvard Allston Work Team.
“So far Harvard seems to believe that the very last thing they need is the voice of community members in the decision making process,” he added.
Whelan said that the Task Force has long wanted to speak directly with University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, who, he said, has been inaccessible.
Lapp headed the work team—a 14-person group commissioned by University President Drew G. Faust comprising Harvard faculty, deans, and alumni—which dissolved after recommendations were released in June and is currently heading future developments in Allston.
With Harvard saying it is committed to reinvigorating Allston, residents say they want to be a part of the decision-making process.
“We’ve wanted to have some kind of voice with the Work Team, but Harvard never really gave us any access whatsoever,” Whelan said.
Task force member Harry E. Mattison echoed Whelan’s frustrations.
“I don’t think we’ve ever been able to reach the University,” Mattison said. “In the past, they’ve sent people to sit in the same room and act like they’re listening.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Demonstrating a chocolate emulsion, Barcelona-based pastry chef and chocolatier Ramon Morató whisked vanilla water into melted chocolate. After a moment, he held up the whisk and a grainy, tough mixture plopped into the bowl.
“Our chocolate is completely broken,” he said in a thick Spanish accent as the audience laughed. “This is a disaster. This is not my chocolate.”
Amid residual chuckles, Morató added the rest of the water.
“We frictionate our chocolate,” he said. At last, the chocolate became smooth and thick. The audience had been tricked, but applauded nonetheless.
Morató spoke Monday with the occasional assistance of a translator as part of the public lecture series accompanying the Science and Cooking undergraduate course at Harvard. His lecture, titled “The Many Faces of Chocolate,” explored the importance of temperature in working with cocoa.
Throughout the lecture, Morató waved around a temperature gage.
“For us, the thermometer is a third arm,” Morató said.
Science and Cooking Professor David Weitz began the lecture with an explanation of the phase transitions of milk, relating them to the behavior of chocolate and the fact that cocoa butter can form a variety of crystals when solidified. Weitz described the method of tempering chocolate, in which chocolatiers heat and cool chocolate around its melting point, to reach a preferred crystal structure.
“By controlling the kinetics of these phase transitions, experts in chocolate can control the way chocolate behaves,” Weitz said.
Morató did just that. He described and occasionally demonstrated six applications of chocolate: melted chocolate, chocolate emulsion, chocolate mousse, molten chocolate cake, velvet effect technique, and thermal shock technique.
Each example elicited murmurs of hungry delight throughout the packed lecture hall. The velvet effect technique—presented in a series of photos—involved spraying a frozen, chocolate chicken with hot, liquid chocolate, creating a surface that mimicked velvet. Morató mentioned that he used that method a few weeks ago for a tart at actress Salma Hayek’s wedding.
During the final example, Morató poured melted chocolate onto a frozen marble tray. The chocolate hardened and was elastic for a few seconds before becoming brittle. In those seconds, Morató bent the chocolate into a structure resembling a crumpled-up tissue. The crowd laughed at the lack of artistry but quieted when Morató presented pictures of his other delicate, intricate designs.
Morató also taught the audience how to best enjoy chocolate.
“Who eats chocolate? The humans. Which is our corporal temperature?” Morató paused and pointed his temperature gauge into his assistant’s mouth. The audience laughed heartily. “36! One degree more or less than the melting point. If we are gourmets, we let it melt. At that moment, we can taste the product in our mouth at its best.”
Morató’s lecture attracted an audience from the greater Cambridge area. Before the lecture, people waited in a line that winded around the Science Center.
Two interns at America’s Test Kitchen of Brookline attended the lecture after hearing about the series last year. Rebekah M. Tsang, who graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in New York in 2008, has a background in pastry making. “I have done a lot of chocolate work before and I wanted to get more information,” she said.
Her fellow intern, Beth R. Burgstahler, said she hoped the lecture would be an educational opportunity. “The next time I work with chocolate, I’ll know more about it,” she said.
Another attendee, Catherine M. Norwood of Somerville, Mass., heard about the lecture series from a friend, though she did not know how he found out.
“There might be an underground network in Boston where food news gets around,” she suggested, smiling. A chemist, Norwood enjoyed the scientific and technical explanations that permeated the lecture.
Meanwhile, three employees of Taza Chocolate, a chocolate maker based in Somerville, Mass., attended the lecture because Morató is taking a tour of their facilities today.
Though the majority of attendees were not affiliated with Harvard, some were undergraduates. One group of freshman women went after seeing the poster around campus. After the lecture, Audrey M. Vernick ’15 tasted Morató’s parting gift, a milk chocolate covered caramel with a cream of pine nuts, and closed her eyes in gastronomic ecstasy. “Unreal,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a prolonged legal dispute, a U.S. district court judge ruled Thursday that Harvard can keep a collection of Persian tablets, defeating an attempt to obtain the artifacts in order to collect damages against the Iranian government.
Jenny Rubin, who is leading the effort, is part of a group of four Americans who were injured in a triple suicide attack in 1997 in Jerusalem. Following the attacks, they sued the Iranian government for damages, claiming that Iranian support for Hamas—who claimed responsibility for the attack—made Tehran liable for damages.
An American court ruled that Iran owed the victims of the attack $423.5 million dollars, but Iran failed to pay.
In order to claim damages, Rubin launched an effort to gain custody of Iranian antiquities held in museums at Harvard and other American universities. Rubin argues that because the antiquities may be the property of the Iranian government she has a right to the items as part of the damages.
But Federal Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. has now ruled in favor of the University, writing that the plaintiffs did not show enough evidence to back their claim that the Persian antiques collection at the Peabody Museum legally belonged to the government of Iran.
“As a general matter, establishing that a particular item was unlawfully exported or removed from Iran is not equivalent to showing that it now should be regarded as property of Iran subject to levy and execution,” O’Toole wrote.
“And as a particular matter, the plaintiffs simply are unable to establish that any item in the possession of the Museums, whether from Persepolis or elsewhere, is rightly considered to be the property of Iran.”
In her suit, Rubin sought to claim a set of six limestone relief fragments that were recovered from the city of Persepolis in ancient Persia.
“We feel that cultural items should be appreciated by everybody. They shouldn’t be seized. There’s a need for justice and this is not the way to justice,” Jamal D. Abdi, policy director for the National Iranian American Council said.
Abdi said he was encouraged by the ruling, which he said was an important part of preserving the Iranian cultural heritage.
“They’d [the relics] be taken out of the museums. The [defense] lawyer suggested they’d be auctioned on Ebay,” Abdi said.
“Another strategy would be “destroying them to make the remaining relics more valuable. They’d be commercial items, or be destroyed—treated like commercial commodities.”
Harvard is not the only university facing a suit of this nature.
Rubin has sued several American universities that house Persian artifacts, including the University of Chicago, which has an extensive collection of Persian clay tablets.
In March the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed a lower court decision that would have handed over the artifacts to Rubin, but the case may continue on appeal.
Rubin’s legal effort has posed a significant risk to university collections, and Thursday’s ruling is an encouraging sign for those who wish to protect antiques on display at university museums.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of three appeals court judges upheld a 2009 ruling last month brought against Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Harvard Medical School teaching hospital, for sex discrimination.
The ruling affrims an award of $1.6 million to Sagun Tuli, who at the time of her employment, was Harvard’s only female spinal neurosurgeon. The 2009 ruling found that Tuli was a victim of gender bias from her supervisor Arthur L. Day, then chair of spinal neurosurgery at the Brigham.
“My hope is that [this suit] will create change,” Tuli told the Crimson in 2009 after the original decision had been handed down. “I risked my career and my reputation.”
Tuli told the Crimson then that she did not accept a prior settlement offer from the hospital because “it will never stop if they just keep paying people off.” She also added that her claims of discrimination had been ignored by people in positions of authority at the Brigham.
Tuli could not be reached for comment for this article.
The decision from the first circuit court of appeals, released Aug. 29, upheld the original federal jury’s ruling that the Brigham give Tuli $1 million because it allowed a hostile work environment to persist and $600,000 in compensatory damages for retaliation after she raised her concerns. The decision also required Day to pay Tuli $20,000 for “economic harm.”
Tuli was also awarded “nominal sums” of $1 apiece on two other claims. She also lost two of her claims, one of which asserted she was paid less than the other doctors in the spinal neurosurgery department due to her gender.
The appeals decision says that “the evidence was ample” that a hostile work environment existed at the Brigham.
According to Tuli, Day and another doctor, Dong H. Kim, were primarily responsible for the hostile environment.
The decision cites several alleged incidents of sexism, including an episode at a graduation dinner in which Day allegedly asked Tuli to “get up on the table to dance so you could show them [guests] how to behave.” In another incident, Tuli described arriving at a co-workers’ bachelorette party to see “a blow up doll with a picture of her face attached to it.”
Among the list of alleged hostile and discriminatory occurrences are sexual advances made by Kim and several incidents in which Day implicitly or explicitly stated that Tuli’s gender compromised her ability to do her job. The decision dates these incidents from 2004 through 2007.
From 2005 through 2007, Tuli brought her concerns about hostile behavior to Anthony D. Whittemore, the Brigham’s chief medical officer. According to the appeals decision, Whittemore discouraged Tuli from filing a formal complaint against Day for discrimination since “Tuli’s fear of retaliation was reasonable and known to him.”
In October 2007, Day, who sat on the hospital’s credentials committee, recommended that Tuli be forced to undergo anger management training. The committee decided to require Tuli obtain an outside psychiatric evaluation within four months as a condition to reappointing her to her position. Tuli filed the original lawsuit in December 2007, and was granted a preliminary injunction that allowed her to keep her job without obtaining a psychiatric evaluation during the trial.
According to a March 28, 2008 Boston Globe article, a total of four women at the Brigham accused Day of sexual discrimination.
Since the case was filed, Day, Kim, and Tuli have all left the Brigham. Both Day and Kim hold faculty positions at the University of Texas Medical School in Houston in the neurosurgery department.
Tuli now works at The Center for Advanced Brain and Spine Surgery in Natick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After pleading guilty to motor vehicle homicide Monday morning, retired Harvard Law School Professor Detlev F. Vagts ’48 was sentenced to three years of probation and six months of house arrest.
Vagts, who spent 40 years as a professor at the Law School, retired in 2005. He started teaching at the Law School in 1959 and currently holds the title of “Bemis Professor of International Law, Emeritus.”
Last summer, Vagts struck and killed Marcia Kearney, 54, a Newton Country Day school teacher.
Vagts, 82, was driving partially in the opposite lane of travel when he hit Kearney at the intersection of Grant Avenue and Ward Street.
Kearney was making a left onto Grant Avenue when the collision threw her from her Vespa.
Following the crash, Vagts drove 448 feet before returning to the location of the accident. Kearney was located approximately 82 feet from the collision, according to a press release from the District Attorney’s Office.
Vagts and his wife were lost and “running late for a dentist appointment” near Hammond Street, according to police reports.
Newton District Court Judge Dyanne J. Klein sentenced Vagts to six months of house arrest in addition to three years of probation. He will be confined to his home with a GPS monitoring bracelet and will only be allowed to leave for his or his wife’s doctor’s appointments.
Klein ordered Vagts not to drive for the rest of his life, exceeding the 15-year mandatory loss of license associated with vehicular homocide.
Vagts could have faced up to two-and-a-half years in jail.
“This defendant has now admitted and accepted responsibility for his role in the death of Marcia Kearney,” Middlesex District Attorney Gerard T. Leone Jr. ’85 said in a press release.
“This is a tragic incident where negligent operation of a motor vehicle resulted in the death of an innocent woman. We commend the court for ensuring that this defendant does not drive ever again. Our thoughts remain with the victim’s family and friends,” he said.
Klein also ordered Vagts to write a letter of apology to Kearney’s family and pay restitution for storage fees, which will be determined at a Dec. 12 hearing.

Updated at 8:00 p.m. on 9/20/2011.
University President Drew G. Faust and the Harvard Corporation have approved the Harvard Allston Work Team’s five recommendations for future University development in Allston, according to a letter mailed to nearly 3,000 Allston-Brighton residents Monday.
The letter comes three months after the work team—a 14-person group commissioned by Faust to help plan the University’s next steps in Allston—released their recommendations on June 16.
“I’m pleased that things are back on track again,” said Paul Berkeley, president of the Allston Civic Association. “For the last two and a half years, we’ve been sitting on our hands to see if anything is going to happen.”
Over the summer, the University solicited feedback from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the City of Boston, and the Boston Redevelopment Authority as it began to flesh out the details of the Work Team’s recommendations.
In Monday’s letter, Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced the University’s intention to move ahead with a two-stage plan for developing Allston. In stage one, the University will begin planning residences and retail outlets in Barry’s Corner, designing a 700,000-square-foot Health and Life Science Center on Western Ave., and discussing the future of the existing Charlesview Apartment complex.
For the second wave of the plan, the University will look into developing an Enterprise Research Campus on Allston Landing North, slated to be a 36-acre mecca for research. It will also explore the possibility of building a hotel and a conference center on the property, which will echo MIT’s Kendall Square.
Lapp—who is heading the University’s development in Allston along with Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and other officials—wrote that Allston residents’ responses to the Work Team’s recommendations were taken into consideration. The University gathered feedback from community members in Task Force meetings, coffee hours, emails, and one-on-one discussions.
The letter, which was also sent to over 600 recipients by email on Tuesday morning, stated that the University will host meetings to gather public input on development in Barry’s Corner. Elkus Manfredi Architects will lead the meetings and intends to craft a proposal for private developers by this March. Construction is tentatively slated to begin in 2013.
Berkeley said residents are particularly concerned with the anticipated inflow of third-party developers.
“I know a big concern residents have is how do we deal with third-party developers? There’s lots of questions about housing initiatives in Barry’s Corner,” Berkeley said. “So It’s a good opportunity to talk about these things.”
Lapp wrote that the two-staged plan will ultimately lead to a master plan to be submitted to city officials in Dec. 2012.

After nearly four decades, Harvard has officially welcomed the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps back to campus. A ribbon-cutting ceremony  Tuesday afternoon celebrated the opening of a satellite office for the Navy on Harvard’s campus.
The ceremony marked the first concrete step in the University’s move to reintegrate ROTC at Harvard.
Previously, ROTC was not recognized by the University because it said “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the military policy that banned gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from serving openly in the military—violated Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy.
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was repealed by Congress in December, and Harvard in March announced it would welcome back ROTC.
The newly created Naval ROTC office will be housed on the second floor of the Student Organization Center at Hilles and will seek to support cadets on campus.
University President Drew G. Faust said that this first step to establish a partnership with the military “not only affirms our shared interest in an inclusive society but also deepens the reservoirs of talent on which the military so vitally depends.” She also said that she hopes the relationship between the University and NROTC serves as a symbol of one of Harvard’s core values.
“I share a new wish today—a wish that this program flourish in the months and years ahead,” she said. “That it exemplify an idea at the heart of our country and our university, that our diversity makes us strong.”
Though NROTC has received a room in the SOCH, cadets will not actually be training on campus.
Harvard is unlikely to establish its own unit until a critical mass of students enroll in an ROTC program, according to Capt. Paul E. Mawn ’63 USNR (Ret.), chairman of Harvard Advocates for ROTC. The costs of establishing a unit are considerable and the Pentagon has recently been under financial constraints, Mawn said.
Still, Captain Curtis R. Stevens, who will serve as the first director of NROTC at Harvard, said that he was “absolutely amazed at the very sincere welcome we have received from everybody here at Harvard.”
Stevens said that he feels that Harvard and the Navy share similar values. “Harvard expects the scholarship and congeniality it fosters in its students will lead them in their later lives to advance knowledge, to [increase] understanding, and to serve society. These are ideals shared by the Navy,” he said.
Faust echoed these sentiments.
“Today we celebrate a society advanced, granting openly gay and lesbian citizens the opportunity to serve the nation creates new possibilities for men and women to pursue their aspirations to grow as leaders and to devote themselves to the noble work of supporting and defending the Constitution,” she said.
Since March, the University has worked on hammering out the details of ROTC’s return.
According to University spokesman Kevin Galvin, the University will continue to pursue talks with the Army and Air Force about recognizing an official relationship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
Our alumni tracker this week has (deservingly so) turned into the Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 MVP tracker. The Bills quarterback lit up the scoreboard again yesterday in a 38-35 nail-biter in Buffalo.
Not only did Fitzpatrick turn in a 264-yard, three-touchdown performance, the Buffalo signal caller fired a touchdown pass to David Nelson on fourth down with 14 seconds left in the final quarter to put the Bills in front for good in a back-and-forth affair.
The real story, though, is Fitzpatrick’s sudden success after a decidedly average first seven years in the NFL. With a career 75.1 passer rating, Fitzpatrick, until the last two weeks, was best known for his impressive, nine-minute, 48-correct-answer sprint through the Wonderlic Test, football’s measure of mental aptitude, and his educational background.
But now Fitzpatrick is playing “winning football,” as ESPN analyst Mike Ditka so eloquently noted.
Fitzpatrick will be put to the test next week as the Bills take on Tom Brady and the explosive New England offense, in what will amount to a homecoming of sorts.
“I’m not looking ahead or anything, but in order to be good in this league and to get to the playoffs and be successful, you have to be successful within your division,” Fitzpatrick told the Globe on Sunday.
And when you think AFC East, the Patriots, the team that has dominated the division for over a decade, certainly come to mind.
Football aside, Fitzpatrick is developing a sort of cult following. “Fear the Beard” signs decorate Buffalo’s stadium, and, following a four-touchdown performance in the Bills’ opener, he spent the past week being featured on numerous talk shows, including Scott Van Pelt’s popular ESPN program. Heck, the man amassed 27 twitter mentions as I penned this article.
As the Harvard graduate takes his talents down south to face the Pats this Sunday, the Bills-Patriots game will feature a legitimate quarterback showdown—for the first time in a long while.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The injuries that cross-country runners suffer are often the result of overuse, like shin splints or IT-band tendonitis. In a sport with little physical contact, traumatic injuries become something of a rarity.
But this was not the case last year for sophomore James Leakos, who suffered a concussion in the 2010 edition of the Harvard-Yale meet in New Haven.
“I was moving to pass some guys and ran over a hill and fell into a sand trap,” Leakos said. “It was a bad experience.”
But Leakos is back, making up for last year’s disappointment in winning fashion and running to victory in a dual meet against Yale at Franklin Park on Saturday. Leakos covered the eight-kilometer course in 24 minutes, 21 seconds to lead the Crimson to an easy 11-point victory over its Ivy-League rival.
“It was more enjoyable celebrating the win with him afterwards as opposed to going to the hospital with him like last year,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
The Crimson’s strategy was to run as a pack for the first five kilometers, then push the pace and outlast the Bulldogs in the last two miles. According to Saretsky, Leakos executed this plan flawlessly.
“I was really pleased with his performance,” said Saretsky. “He ran with the confidence and poise of a seasoned veteran.”
Leakos demonstrated his prowess as the lead pack dwindled.
As freshman Billy Orman, a handful of Yale Harriers, and Leakos all vied for the top spot, the two Harvard runners knew exactly when to turn up the dial.
Leakos and Orman slowly pulled away from their opponents to snag a 1-2 finish in the Crimson’s only home meet of the year. Orman, running in his first-ever collegiate eight-kilometer race, clocked a time of 24:24.
“We’d been feeling them out a while, taking a few quick steps and seeing how long it took them to get back,” Leakos said of the strategy he and Orman used to pull away from the Bulldog runners. “I knew they were hurting when we wanted to pull away. When we went, we went. We definitely knew we could beat them if we ran our race strategy right.”
Saturday’s win was especially sweet for Leakos because of last year’s let-down. Not only did Leakos leave that race with a concussion, but the Crimson runners executed their race plan poorly and lost to a Yale team Harvard felt was not as talented.
“Last year, for example, I think we had the better team, but we went into the race overconfident,” Leakos said. “We went out way too fast and we died. They put some guys ahead of us that they shouldn’t have.
“This year, we knew we were good, and we just had to make sure we didn’t let them get [a win] they shouldn’t have,” he added.
Harvard made sure they didn’t suffer a repeat of last year, outscoring the Bulldogs, 23-34. Sophomores Kurt Ruegg (24:41), Maks Korolev (24:44) and Kellen Blumberg (24:57) finished fifth, sixth, and ninth, respectively, to round out the scoring positions for the Crimson.
With the mostly freshmen and sophomores leading the pack for Harvard, it was somewhat unclear as to who would step up and assume the number-one runner spot for the Crimson.
“Going into the race, [Leakos] had been really strong in our workouts,” Saretsky said. “This team has a potential for lots of number-one guys. James is super-competitive. He’s got the ability to run through pain like few others have.”
Leakos attributes his impressive early-season performance to his summertime training that has left him in arguably the best shape of his life.
“My training has been going really well,” Leakos said. “I’ve been pretty much injury free, and I got my mileage up to levels I never have this summer. This season, I’ve been running faster than I ever have been, so I’m looking forward to the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Encountering strange weather for a September weekend in the Northeast, the Harvard sailing team faced problems launching off from the docks due to lack of wind and minor breezes and struggled to emulate the success of its strong opening weekend.
The coed squad competed at nearby MIT in the Hatch Brown Trophy regatta on the Charles River, finishing in the middle of the pack in ninth place. The women’s team traveled up to Dartmouth to race in the Mrs. Hurst Bowl intersectional, ending the weekend in 17th place.
“Conditions were really tricky,” co-captain Brendan Kopp said. “Usually we feel like we have a home field advantage on the Charles River, but the conditions were so wacky this weekend.”
The Crimson had to deal with unusual circumstances all weekend, first by sending out three boats to compete in an uncommon three-division format for the Hatch Brown Trophy.  In the Mrs. Hurst Bowl, the weather only permitted Harvard to finish four races in the two-day event, less than half the racing done in a typical regatta. Still, the Crimson gained experience in dealing with light winds and shaky weather.
“The wind was shifty and really up and down,” Kopp said. “The velocity was behaving in a way that was atypical, and this confused us, as it did all of the other teams.”
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
At the Hatch Brown Trophy, Harvard finished in ninth in the 18-team field.  While Kopp said the weather conditions could have been better, he and sophomore Sarah Pierson still managed to take home 11 top-10 finishes, ending the weekend in fifth place in the A-division.
“Kopp and Pierson continued to really solidify themselves as a really great combination for the team,” sophomore Caitlin Watson said. “They had a very solid weekend.”
In addition to Kopp and Pierson’s effort, the B-division trio of senior skipper Emily Lambert, freshman skipper Reid Bergsund, and senior crew Alexandra Jumper also notched 11 top-10 finishes, ending the weekend in 12th place.
Competing in C-division was the rookie pairing of freshmen Gram Slattery and Brian Drumm.  This regatta marked the first intersectional competition for both freshmen.
“These freshmen had only done college sailing for two weeks, and they did well,” Kopp said.
Recording eight top-10 finishes and ending the weekend with 162 points, Slattery and Drumm showed the young potential of the squad.
“We’re a young team right now because we graduated a lot of seniors last year,” Kopp said. “We are trying to put the newer kids in to sail against the best competition to allow them to improve the fastest.”
The Crimson finished the Hatch Brown Trophy regatta with 437 points, while the Cougars of the College of Charleston took first place with 297 points.
“Everyone did better on Sunday than on Saturday so that was a good trend,” Kopp said. “We have a big regatta next weekend for the co-ed team.”
MRS. HURST BOWL
The weekend affair at Mascoma Lake proved to be challenging for the Harvard sailing team, as it did for the other 19 teams that the Crimson competed against.  The weather was uncooperative, and numerous races were cancelled or abandoned. There was a light northerly breeze for a few hours, which allowed for some races to stay on schedule.
“The lack of wind was frustrating.” Watson said. “There were a limited amount of races and only four got off.  This did not give us enough time to rebound and do better as the regatta went on.”
In the A-division, sophomore skipper Morgan Russom and fellow classmate Isabel Ruane recorded 54 points after four races, while sophomore Caitlin Watson and freshman Emma Smith raced in the B-division, earning 51 points of their own.
On Saturday, only four races in each division were completed, as three races and one sequence were abandoned due to weather issues. Officials hoped for a better breeze on Sunday to facilitate more races, but the A-division only finished one race, while the sole B-division race was abandoned soon after it was started, at which time the day, and the regatta, was called.
Overall, Harvard ended the event with 105 points in 17th place.  The Lady Camels of Connecticut College finished in first place with 47 points.
While this was only the second weekend of regattas for the Crimson sailing squad, the team will use the performances and results to build and prepare for next weekend.
“This weekend definitely gave us some light wind experience,” Watson said. “We will improve at practice for the regattas ahead.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About one fifth of Harvard’s undergraduate population play on a varsity sports team, but it is estimated that more than four times that number are athletically active. According to the Harvard University Admissions Office, “When club sports, intramurals, and varsity teams are taken into account, it is estimated that over 75 percent of our students participate in some level of athletic activity.”
Athletics play an incredibly important role in providing certain life skills and health benefits to Harvard undergraduates. In fact, one of the first comments about Harvard students on College Prowler (a website that compares various universities) is that “there are very few overweight people.”
Being in shape also gives you a confidence in yourself that goes beyond just looking more “swoll.” It can improve your mood and boost your energy levels. The next time you feel like you’re falling asleep in the middle of a research paper, try going for a run instead of hitting up the coffee machine.
Exercise can even help improve your sex life. According to a study by the Mayo Clinic, exercise can help get those hormones running as well as give you the energy for a long night.
In addition to improving physical health (and maybe help getting a few dates), athletics can play a valuable role in developing life skills like self-discipline, teamwork, dedication, and dealing with failure—something that can sometimes be a very valuable lesson for Harvard students.
Even just being a fan can help contribute to the community atmosphere of a university, teach one to be empathetic, and provide a stress-relieving study break.
Making the walk across the river to catch a game also helps support the varsity athletes who spend hours a week training. In fact, the life of a varsity athlete at Harvard is not an easy one.
Things that may just be minor inconveniences for some of us—dining hall hours for example—can actually prevent some athletes from eating breakfast before a morning lift session, or force them to skip dinner for a 4-7 p.m. practice. Shuttle schedules, strict academic absence policies, and large time commitments are all challenges that face a student-athlete at Harvard.
Considering how much Harvard brags about its commitment to athletics, I think that the administration could make a few more concessions to the student-athlete population, especially considering that these varsity competitors are by no means the only Crimson athletes.
In fact, if the 75 percent figure holds true, that means more than 50 percent of Harvard students exercise on their own time; some nearly as much as those in the official Crimson uniform. You can find them any given evening swarming the Malkin Athletic Center, playing intramurals, going for group runs along the Charles or walking down JFK Street to a club sports practice.
So if these students are so motivated, why the “appreciation” part? Well as approximately 75 percent of you know, exercising can be tough sometimes. There are always those days when you roll out of bed in the morning, intending to go for a run then realize how comfortable your pillow was, or how much you’d rather just go to the dining hall and make a Veri-taffle.
Or for those varsity athletes, who have no choice, there’s that moment when you’re leaving for early practice and realize that p-set that you were up till 3 a.m. finishing had another page.
And as fall comes to a close and the weather starts to change, it’ll get harder and harder to slip into those trainers in the mornings and head into the cold air.
So this is where appreciation comes in. First appreciate what athletics do for you, whether as a Crimson fan, a casual jogger, a supporter of some team back home (we’re fine with it as long as it’s not the Yankees) or a varsity level competitor. Appreciate how fine you look in your jeans after a day in the gym and how good you feel when you do decide that it’s worth the effort.
Second appreciate others. Take some time to support varsity Crimson athletes, or the person on the elliptical next to you, push your roommates to go for a run or play some pick up ball at the MAC.
At the end of the day, athletics play a major role in Harvard student life, and it’s up to us to appreciate it.

Who says you can't eat healthy HUHDS meals? At any dining hall, students can mirror their meals to match the Healthy Eating Plate released Wednesday by Harvard Health Publications and researchers from Harvard's School of Public Health.  We've demonstrated an example of a balanced plate pieced together which includes brown rice as the whole grain, lean chicken from the grill for protein, a hearty helping of spinach with garlic and carrots as varied and wholesome vegetables, and a multicolored apple. Olive oil can be drizzled on the chicken for some healthy fats and a tall glass of still water quenches any student's thirst. Meals like these are nutritious and guiltless!

The City of Cambridge officially launched a new notification system last week, and they're encouraging the Harvard community to sign up.The Cambridge Alert Network—which consists of CodeRED for emergency notifications, CitizenObserver for crime alerts, and Cambridge E-Line for general information—will allow subscribers to receive timely and targeted notifications via phone, text message, or email depending on the service they sign up for.
"It will be extremely helpful in communicating information directly to the community during natural disasters, snow parking bans and other types of emergencies," said City Manager Robert W. Healy.
CodeRED, the newest of the Cambridge Alert Network trifecta, will operate similar to the MessageMe emergency notification service that Harvard currently provides.
E-Line and CitizenObserver had been in use for a few years prior to last week's launch. Longtime subscribers to E-Line were recently added to the new CodeRED subscriber list, which was put to use late-August when Hurricane Irene was headed toward Massachusetts.
Now you'll be all set the next time a blizzard, a heat wave, an earthquake, and a hurricane decide to head our way all in the same year.

Students commuting to and from the Quad pass the black granite sculpture every day with hardly a second thought. Few are aware that the two connected ornamental seats in front of the Longy School of Music on Garden Street are intended as interactive art.
Unlike the look-don't-touch aura that surrounds most sculpture, these stone thrones, called "King and Queen," are meant to be sat on. You—and perhaps your date—can feel like royalty as you watch cars and bikes glide down Garden Street.
According to the plaque at the base of the sculpture, "King and Queen" was made by David Bakalar in 1987. In that time, it has rarely been used as a seat.
"I've worked at Longy for seven years [and] I was a student here prior. I don't know if I've ever noticed anyone sitting," said Ruth E. Blackburn, executive assistant to the dean of Longy. "I've seen kids climb on it."
Out of 50 passersby on Monday morning, 35 people did not notice the sculpture at all, and 15 said they had seen it but did not think of sitting on it.
Sebastian K. Gehrig, a professor at Heidelberg University in Germany doing research in Cambridge, said that although he walks past the sculpture at least once a day, "I didn't notice it."
Once he did contemplate the piece, he said it looked less like a chair than "something to decorate." But he liked the idea. "It's nice to have something to sit on. In front of an entrance, if you wait for something, you usually try to find a seat."
Even if the purpose of "King and Queen" isn't quite obvious, Blackburn praised the concept of a statue for sitting. "You're actually touching it, thinking, here I am interacting with this piece of art. You contemplate matters you hadn’t thought about before just because you are in a different position. I guess that’s what art does. It provokes thought," she said.
