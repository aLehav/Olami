After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The phrase “summer music” has always been one of criticism’s immortal cop-outs, a meaningless code word for good music that sticks to major keys and keeps its song lengths within reason. It’s not exactly a watershed revelation that the stuff mixes well with beach parties. Recently, though, it’s come to stand for a more specific aesthetic: haze. Chillwave and surf-pop groups have staked a laid-back claim to the summer airwaves, releasing reverb-heavy album after reverb-heavy album on labels with apt names like Mexican Summer that know how to sell their specific brand of sleepy bliss.
This recent trend is why it’s so easy to almost pre-hear Frankie Rose’s new album “Careers” (released with vocalist Drew Citron under the name Beverly) after a quick glance at its cover, which is a near-parody of surfy symbolism. There’s a giant, Hockney-esque pool. Large cursive script. An extremely high tint-to-shade ratio. All it’s missing is a stick-on label that reads “Here be fuzzy melodies.”
In this case, what you see is what you get. “Careers” is a pleasant album, and one that is much more sonically rich than a lot of the records it evokes, but it’s nothing new. It’s also a disappointing detour of sorts for Frankie Rose, whose past two solo efforts were more engrossing and expansive than the backstage role she takes on "Careers." Beverly might be Rose’s main focus moving forward, or a one-off side project (it’s always tough to predict what she’ll do next), but “Careers” doesn’t ask a lot of questions that feel like they need answering in a follow-up.
The album opens with “Madora,” which sounds like a tame outtake from “Bossanova.” A better comparison for the rest of the album, though, is a poppier Pixies offshoot—The Breeders. With its whispered verses, two-word choruses, and cut time drumming, “Careers” sounds like something Kim Deal’s side project could’ve recorded while in a collective good mood.
Even with Steve Albini behind the sliders, though, it probably wouldn’t have come out sounding this good. Like Rose’s synthier solo albums “Interstellar” and “Herein Wild,” “Careers” benefits from top-shelf production. The vocals on the album, especially, are mixed wonderfully, coming out with an almost instrument-like quality. Unlike with many surf-rock albums, it doesn’t sound like they’re competing with fuzzy guitars for sonic space, but rather blending with them to emphasize the group’s simple yet effective harmonic lines. The guitar parts themselves sound expansive on “Careers,” as well—on the angular riffs of lead single “Honey Do,” you can hear the individual strings within each chord. “Careers” doesn’t have the frantic drive that makes its lo-fi cousins so much fun, but it’s definitely ear candy.
The album does suffer from a serious dip in the middle, though, starting with the sluggish “Yale’s Life” (the lyrics are tough to hear, but I’ll assume they’re about jealousy and constant fear of being robbed). The instrumental “Ambular” starts off with a promising, distorted riff, and then basically repeats it for two-and-a-half minutes. “Out on a Ride,” the album’s worst track, sounds completely tossed-off. For the most part, though, the songwriting on “Careers” is solid at its worst and infectious at its best—especially on “Honey Do,” “All the Things,” and “You Can’t Get It Right.”
All this is to say that there are worse poolside or road-tripping albums than “Careers,” especially if you don’t play it off your laptop. But it’s not a record that you or I or anyone will remember by the time next summer rolls around, and that means it falls short of what Frankie Rose is capable of accomplishing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HO CHI MINH, Vietnam—When I ask one of my young cousins, born and raised in Vietnam’s vibrant Ho Chi Minh City, to show me the best places to go “as a local,” he takes me to one of the fanciest department stores in the city. (“There's a movie theater that's really nice up there,” he says.) The famous Benh Thanh Market is too much effort, according to another cousin, because she doesn’t know how to bargain. These family members, comfortably middle class, direct me to destinations like Japanese restaurants and classy coffee shops that could’ve been transported off the streets of Boston. When they vacation in Vietnam, they head not to Hue or Hoi An—places rich in history—but instead to the ritzy white-sand beaches and multi-million dollar resorts of Nha Trang.
The first couple of weeks I spent in Ho Chi Minh City, I was frustrated by my inability to find the “authentic” Vietnam. Markets, temples, war sites, hole-in-the-wall restaurants with the cheapest, most amazing food. And now, I can say this: They’re there. If you look for them, flip through Western guides, and wander the city streets.
But the “locals”? They’re not really that interested. A harsh spectator might say that they don't have any awareness of the cultural uniqueness and significance of their country. But aren't they doing just what I am: trying to find “the exotic”? What to me is remarkable is to those around me just life. I feel a little ashamed walking into a gorgeous temple with a camera to see people too busy kowtowing three times at the feet of the Lady of Mercy on reed mats and praying with bundles of incense in their hands to be snap a photo of the mesmerizing 10-foot statue. And I’m also embarrassed that—even though I was born in Vietnam—when I think of the country, I see the same straw roofs and bustling markets that a complete stranger might imagine.
The motorbikes, though. The motorbikes with their violent honking horns and dare-devil attempts to one-up each other on streets crammed to capacity. They are the Vietnam I remember, one that I hope never disappears. Things have changed a little, of course—reflections of the continual forward march of time and Vietnam’s rapid developmental pace. The bikers wear helmets now. And drive on the right side of the street. Mostly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 2, 2014, at 5:34 p.m.
A new set of University-wide Title IX policies and procedures set to take effect this fall will create a central office to investigate cases of sexual assault and gender-based harassment and institute a “preponderance of the evidence” standard for evaluating those allegations.
The new policy, unveiled Wednesday, dramatically changes how cases of sexual assault are handled at Harvard. The new Office of Sexual and Gender Based Dispute Resolution will employ professional investigators and essentially remove investigative responsibility from individual disciplinary boards across schools. Based on the facts provided by the central office, those disciplinary boards will work with University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides to issue sanctions.
The “preponderance of the evidence” standard that the office will employ is seen by many as a lower burden of proof than the “sufficiently persuaded” standard currently used by the College’s Administrative Board. The preponderance of the evidence standard, favored by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, is generally understood to require more than 50 percent certainty to determine guilt.
Absent from the new policy is an affirmative consent requirement, under which partners must affirmatively communicate their willingness to participate in sexual activity. Activists on Harvard’s campus, such as those involved with the group Our Harvard Can Do Better, and across the country have lobbied for such a clause.
Instead, Harvard’s new policy—which also applies to faculty and staff—uses a standard of “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” to define sexual harassment,  a term which encompasses sexual assault and a number of other actions. According to the policy, a number of actions, including conduct that “interferes with or limits a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from [University programs]” fall under “unwelcome sexual conduct.”
In a statement, University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said that there is no “standard definition” of affirmative consent.
Wednesday’s announcement comes amid federal review of Harvard’s handling of sexual assault cases. In March, two undergraduates—at least one who is a member of Our Harvard Can Do Better—filed a complaint with OCR alleging that the College’s sexual assault policies violate Title IX. OCR has since opened an investigation into those policies and procedures, as it has with dozens of other colleges and universities across the United States.
Harvard Law School’s policies are also under federal investigation, prompted by a complaint filed with OCR in 2010.
Under the procedures announced Wednesday, involved parties may respond in writing to the report filed by the investigative office and may appeal if procedural errors occur or new evidence surfaces. While there is no timeframe for original complaints to be filed, appeals must be delivered within a week of the release of the final investigative report.
Parties to the case may also request an “informal resolution” decided by an official from the investigative office, which would presumably eschew the more formal disciplinary measures that are traditionally applied. Any “informal resolution” must be granted before the investigation is concluded and a final report is delivered and approved by the complainant, the respondent, and Karvonides in consultation with the relevant school.
The new procedures also allow for complainants to request anonymity, though the policy draft says that such a request “may mean an investigation cannot go forward” or might result in an alternative resolution to the claim.
Karvonides said in a press release that the new central investigative office “will create a new level of continuity and consistency” in the way the University handles allegations of sexual assault. She also said that though central investigators are at the center of the new policy, individual schools will be involved in cases involving their students.
University President Drew G. Faust, who made the development of new sexual assault support and response procedures a priority this spring, hailed the new policy on Wednesday.
“This new, progressive policy–alongside the new, centralized procedures for investigating reports–will significantly enhance Harvard’s ability to address these incidents when they occur,” Faust said in a statement.
While the new policies will take effect this fall, Karvonides confirmed that it has not yet been approved by OCR. She added, though, that University leadership felt that waiting much longer to announce might make implementing the policy difficult in time for the fall term.
