After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a speech in Beijing Tuesday morning, University President Drew G. Faust reiterated her argument that universities can help combat climate change through their research endeavors.
Speaking at Tsinghua University during her trip to China, Faust focused on the way that collaboration between universities can promote research. Since arriving in China, she has also delivered a keynote address at a “Your Harvard” alumni event and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“Global problems require global partners,” Faust said at Tsinghua on Tuesday, according to her prepared remarks. “Climate change is a perfect example. We breathe the same air. We drink the same water. We share the planet. We cannot live in a cocoon. The stakes are too high.”
Faust cited a century-long partnership between Harvard and Chinese universities, such as researcher Ernest Henry Wilson, who in 1908 traveled through the Yangtze River with Chinese researchers to collect plans for Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum. Faust also pointed to the Harvard China Project, a 22-year-old School of Engineering and Applied Sciences-based group that has drawn collaboration between Harvard and more than a dozen Chinese institutions to research the environment and energy in China.
“These partnerships are bearing fruit: From last year’s Harvard-Tsinghua conference on market mechanisms for a low-carbon future, to open access education reaching millions worldwide, to advances in human health and health-care policy that will improve and extend lives,” Faust said.
Faust’s speech also focused on the role of research and education to address climate change.
“We mold minds capable of innovation because we are able to imagine a world different from the one we live in—a world with 'green' cities and adaptive buildings with skin-like membranes; a bionic leaf that can generate liquid fuel and a metal-free organic battery, all long-range areas of research,” Faust said.
Faust has emphasized the role of research in her argument that Harvard should not divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies. From open letters to University affiliates to emails to Harvard faculty members calling for divestment and encounters with activist group Divest Harvard, Faust has routinely maintained that Harvard can confront climate change “not through presidential pronouncements,” but through the work of faculty and other affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a matchup of two of the nation’s top offenses in men’s lacrosse, only one team continued its prolific start to the season on Saturday. No. 19/18 Brown (5-0, 1-0 Ivy) again lit up the scoreboard, as the Bears tallied nine goals in the second half alone en route to a 14-9 victory over the visiting No. 10/13 Crimson (4-2, 0-1 Ivy) at Stevenson Field.
While Harvard went into halftime with a slim 6-5 advantage, Brown used a 3-1 third quarter to take a one-goal lead into the final frame. The Bears left no doubt about their scoring prowess with an explosive fourth quarter, which included a couple insurance goals late as Brown capitalized on Harvard’s need to press to win back possession with time winding down. The Bears scored four goals in the last 4:11 to turn a slim 10-8 margin into a comfortable victory.
On a day in Providence with foul weather, Harvard’s inability to produce sustained possessions ultimately proved the difference. The Crimson badly lost the face-off and ground ball battles with the game on the line in the final 15 minutes. Going 1-9 at the X and controlling just five ground balls to Brown’s 13 in the fourth quarter, Harvard allowed the Bears to control the game late, and the Crimson defense could not hold off the scoring juggernaut given the disparity in possession.
“Brown outplayed us, really, in the middle of the field on ground balls, which is disappointing,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik'96. “I thought their poles were really good off the ground, especially between the lines and off the face-offs, so...I think that was the big difference.”
Harvard also far surpassed its previous season high with 26 turnovers on Saturday, 17 of which came in the first half when the Crimson appeared ready to break open the contest. Harvard built a two-goal lead on three separate occasions in the half, including at the outset of the game. However, on all three occasions, turnovers prevented the Crimson from building on its advantage and led directly to goals for the Bears.
“Their offense benefits from their transition game,” junior co-captain Stephen Jahelka said. “They capitalized on our offensive turnovers and were able to turn stops into transition offense on the other end of the field, which ultimately resulted in goals.”
Both of junior attackman Kylor Bellistri’s tallies for Brown came in the final minutes of the first half off of Harvard giveaways. He notched his second score with just seconds left in the second quarter to bring Brown within one and give the Bears momentum heading into the break.
Brown carried that momentum into the second half, scoring less than two minutes into the third quarter. While the Crimson answered with a goal from junior midfielder Ian Ardrey to bring the score to 7-6 to notch its first lead of the game, the hosts finished the contest on an 8-2 run that saw seven different Bears find the net.
If not for the heroics of junior Bryan Moore in cage, Brown may have exceeded its Division I-best scoring average on Saturday. The Bears outshot Harvard 31 to 14 in the second half, matching the Crimson’s shot total for the entire game in the final 30 minutes. Moore had to make a career-high 17 saves just to hold Brown to 14 goals, less than five below the Bears’ 18.5 per game entering the contest.
A positive for the Crimson was the continued success of freshman midfielder Joe Lang. The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Week turned in another great game, scoring or assisting on five of Harvard’s six first half goals, including the team’s first four of the contest. Although he didn’t record a point in the second half, Lang led the Crimson with three goals and two assists and now stands as Harvard’s second-leading scorer heading into its tilt with No. 2 North Carolina in Chapel Hill on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are two dates that matter for the Harvard women’s ice hockey team’s Frozen Four matchup against Boston College this Friday night in Minneapolis.
The first is Nov. 28, 2014. One day after Thanksgiving, the Crimson (26-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) has the stuffing knocked out of it. The Eagles (34-2-2, 21-0-1 Hockey East) explode for eight unanswered goals en route to a 10-2 walloping, dropping Harvard to 0-2-2 over the past four contests.
“This game shows us where we can be at the end of the season,” says senior forward Lyndsey Fry in a postgame interview. “We have a lot of time between now and the national championship.”
The second is Feb. 10, 2015. Playing for the Beanpot Championship, the undefeated and then-No.1 BC squad (27-0-1) takes a 2-1 lead, only to watch the Crimson come back with a pair of second-period goals. There are 28 more minutes for Harvard to weather—four more Eagle power plays, 13 more shots on goal—but the Crimson hangs on for the Beanpot title to crown its skaters the new queens of Boston.
“Coming back to win today was huge for us,” says junior forward Miye D’Oench after the game. “Obviously, beating an undefeated team proves to everyone else and ourselves that we can go all the way.”
The games are just water under the Longfellow Bridge, of course, but in the four decades of competition between the area schools, an awful lot of water has passed by. Harvard and Boston College have squared off 53 times, and they will meet again this Friday in Minneapolis with a spot in the national championship game on the line.
“To be honest, I think we’re just going to approach it like we do every other game,” co-captain Samantha Reber said. “I know there’s a lot more at stake, considering it is for a national championship, but we’ve faced them twice this year. We know what they’re about.”
The second-seeded Eagles will take the ice having lost just twice this season—once to the Crimson and once in their conference final to Boston University. Between mid-October and mid-February, BC strung together 24 consecutive wins.
Harvard is riding a streak of its own, having compiled a 11-1-1 record since the beginning of February. In its most recent games against No. 9/9 Cornell and No. 6/6 Quinnipiac, the Crimson exploded for 12 goals total to win the ECAC and punch a ticket to the Frozen Four, respectively.
But offensive outbursts are more characteristic of the Eagles, who boast the most potent attack in Division I this year. BC has racked up six or more goals 18 times, and the team posted an overall mark of 5.11 scores per match, over half a goal higher than the nearest competitor.
The duo of junior forwards Alex Carpenter and Haley Skarupa has underpinned much of this success. The pair has accumulated the top two highest point totals in Division I women’s hockey this year with 81 and 71, respectively.
“Obviously BC is…a great team,” junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer said. “They have a lot of offensive force. We need to focus on shutting down their offensive chances.”
Harvard will aim to prevent these chances by relying on Maschmeyer and a veteran line of defensemen that includes two former Olympians in senior Josephine Pucci and junior Michelle Picard. The Crimson concedes an average of 1.53 goals a game, good for fifth in the nation.
While 10 of the nation's top 70 point-getters are Eagles, Harvard has only three such players. Junior forward Mary Parker leads the pack with 38 points, and fellow forwards Miye D’Oench and Reber are not far behind.
In the Crimson’s five losses on the year, however, offensive efficiency has proven to be a fatal flaw, as Harvard has converted only one power play in 14 chances during defeats. The number falls a far cry from the Crimson’s average conversion rate of 24.4 percent.
But does the Crimson feel like an underdog?
“No,” Maschmeyer said with a laugh. “Of course not…. We know obviously that we can beat them, and we have confidence that we can do it again.”

After losing to No. 5 Syracuse on Sunday by one goal, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (3-2, 1-0 Ivy) easily handled Stetson (2-5) in a 12-goal victory on Tuesday evening in DeLand, Fla. After heading into halftime, 9-1, the Crimson maintained its lead for the remainder of the match, ultimately topping the Hatters, 17-5.
Two sophomore players notched hat-tricks for Harvard. Megan Hennessey opened the contest with an unassisted score within the first two minutes of the first half and also clinched four draw controls for the Crimson, contributing to Harvard’s edge over Stetson in draw controls, 15-8. Hennessey also tallied one assist and two groundballs.
Sophomore Marisa Romeo followed up Hennessey’s first goal with an unassisted goal in the fourth minute of the opening period. In addition to two more goals that closed the first half, Romeo notched an assist after feeding to freshman midfielder Nekele McCall in the final minutes.
Junior co-captain and midfielder Audrey Todd notched three points herself, registering one goal and two assists. The Baltimore native also secured three draw controls for Harvard.
“We were very excited to have run our offense so successfully throughout the whole game,” Todd said. “Over the past few weeks, a major focus at practice has been staying in structure on the attacking side of the ball. Our coaches have consistently reiterated that goals will come if we stay in structure, and I think our high-scoring performance yesterday proved just that.”
The Crimson came out with a strong start on offense, with Harvard shooting 21 times in the first half versus seven shots by the Hatters. Six Crimson players contributed to the nine goals tallied in the first frame.
“We no doubt had a great game yesterday,” Todd said. “I think we were all particularly pleased to have such a strong first half because starting fast has been a team goal throughout each of my three seasons at Harvard.”
Junior captain defender Tory Waldstein led Harvard with two forced turnovers and four groundballs. The Crimson defense held the Stetson offense to just five goals and created a total of seven turnovers.
“Defensively against Stetson we knew we could be really aggressive,” Waldstein said. “So that's how we started the game, and it definitely paid off. We were able to start really strong and take a big lead. Going into the second half we just wanted to continue to play the same way. It was good to take care of that game because we have a stretch of tough and important games coming up.”
In the cage, junior co-captain goalie Kelly Weis recorded three saves for Harvard and only allowed three goals against. The Crimson defense also executed 12-of-14 clears, while the Hatters could only complete 11-of-18. Stetson goalie Whitney Meyers tallied 12 saves in the net and led the Hatters with three ground balls.
“Every victory is obviously important and exciting, but I think this win is particularly significant because it gives us some momentum heading into Princeton on Saturday,” Todd said. “Ivy matchups are always extremely competitive and feisty, so it is definitely good to have some extra confidence heading into next weekend’s big game.”

In anticipation of the Harvard men’s basketball team’s second-round NCAA Tournament game against North Carolina, The Back Page takes a look at five of the other things to do in Jacksonville while waiting for the Crimson to tip off.
1. Beaches: On the eastern coast of Florida, Jacksonville has no shortage of beaches, replete with gorgeous white sand and makeshift volleyball nets that accompany them. The city’s three main beach areas are Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach—totaling 22 miles of beach in all. Given the brutal Northeast Cambridge weather, Harvard fans can take solace in the warm, paradise-like climate.
2. World Golf Hall of Fame: Jacksonville doesn’t have the greatest domestic sports reputation, as anyone vaguely acquainted with Blaine Gabbert will tell you. However, it is as prominent a golf town as any, close to the PGA Tour office, the TPC at Sawgrass Stadium course where the Player’s Championship is held, and the World Golf Hall of Fame. For those interested in golf’s darker side, Jacksonville is roughly an hour from Tiger Woods’ mansion—although you’re unlikely to see the club that wrecked his Escalade in this museum.
3. King Street District: For late night activity, the best place to visit in Jacksonville is the King Street District, which boasts the majority of the city’s (moderate) nightlife. Dahlia’s Pour House and the Blind Rabbit win prizes for the most inventive names.
4. Flagler College Cafeteria: Jacksonville is home to arguably the world’s nicest cafeteria outside of Mather House. No, really. Flagler College is reportedly home to 79 Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass windows, the world’s largest connection of its kind that is still in its original location.
5. Cumberland Island: For those looking to get off the mainland, Cumberland is a small island not far from downtown Jacksonville up I-95. It is both historic and reportedly beautiful and can be reached by ferry from Fernandina Beach, 35 miles north of Jacksonville.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JACKSONVILLE, Fla.—The thing about really good players is that they often turn reporters into pretty poor journalists.
It’s easy fall into clichés, looking down at your notes after a game and seeing a surfeit of platitudes and truisms stuck between play descriptions. You realize that you paired two different coast-to-coast layups with banalities such as “Not only did he take the ball one from baseline to the other, but he also led his team from start to finish”—the stock phrases that make you shudder when you spot them on sports pages.
It’s easy for your hands to hover, frozen, over your notebook, forgetting to jot down what happened on a play as you attempt, instead, to mentally comprehend how that player made it from the corner to the basket in just one seemingly lazy, careless dribble.
And, finally, it’s easy to finish a graf and realize that you’d already written a very similar sentiment—in just as many words—in a previous gamer, about the same player.
This is the challenge that has presented itself to those who have covered Harvard basketball this year—while the success of Harvard hoops may no longer be a novelty, the nearly unprecedented Ivy League success of senior wing Wesley Saunders has made us continually search for the right words to describe him, his play, and his plays.
The reason why it’s so difficult to find these words may simply be that they just don’t exist in the Ancient Eight basketball lexicon as of yet—and if such language has been employed to describe a player in the past, it frames the athlete as an anomaly, an ultra-agile misfit amidst the more routine Ancient Eight competition. Take Jeremy Lin ’10, for example, who was formerly listed as a “sensation” and “magic[al]” in these same pages.
The thing is, it really shouldn’t be this way. We shouldn’t have to stretch ourselves to find words that convey the shock we see at a particularly athletic dunk or acrobatic layup from Saunders. We should be used to this by now.
Two years ago, we wrote that he had come into his own: after averaging 3.3 points per game as a freshman, he found a new level, averaging 16.2 his sophomore year. He led a No. 14 seed with just two upperclassman rotation players to its first-ever NCAA Tournament win, outplaying future NBA first-round pick Tony Snell along the way.
He upped the bar the following year, winning Ivy League Player of the Year and taking Harvard to the brink of the Sweet Sixteen. Yet, something about his play that still surprises us, even when he has performed at this level for so long—even when he is “just Wes.”
While Saunders did not win Ivy League Player of the Year this year, his performance this year has been as strong, if not stronger, than a year ago. He was third in the league in scoring, second in assists (by 0.1 a game), first in steals, fifth in shooting percentage, and third in minutes.
His performance last Saturday in the Ivy League’s one-game playoff was indicative of the type of dominance he’s shown all year. Down five to Yale with 15 minutes to go, Saunders had three-straight three-point plays—propelling his team back into the game, into the lead, and into control. The Crimson trailed only once following his personal 9-0 run, and—you guessed it—a Saunders basket regained Harvard’s advantage just 20 seconds later.
Going into Thursday night’s Tournament matchup with No. 4-seeded North Carolina, all eyes will be on Saunders. NBA scouts, who’ve been parked at Lavietes Pavilion all year, want to see if his conference heroics transfer to the biggest stage—if he is as effective when his opponent is donning Tar Heel, not Bulldog, blue.
History tells us that he won’t shy away from the moment. The wing has led Harvard in scoring in three out of the four March Madness contests that he has started. He had 18 points—on 5-of-8 shooting—against No. 3-seeded New Mexico two years ago, 12 points against Cincinnati in 2014, and 22 points against perennial powerhouse Michigan State in last year’s Round of 32. In the de facto elimination game Saturday, he led all scorers with 22.
Not that North Carolina will make it easy. The Tar Heels are known for their length, making it harder for the senior to skip his way into the paint as he is wont to do. UNC is dominant on the boards, which will make it more difficult for him to have the success on the offensive glass that’s a staple of his game. Tar Heels coach Roy Williams will watch the tape from UVA’s rout of Harvard, noting that when defenders don’t bite on his pump fakes, Saunders struggles to get good shots up.
The odds are against Saunders and the Crimson going into this matchup. There’s no doubt about that. Various metrics and sportsbooks will tell you that UNC has the advantage, and the talking heads that deemed Harvard a “trendy upset pick” heading into the 2014 NCAA Tournament have shied away from the Crimson in the days before this year’s Big Dance. But the thing is, Saunders has always found a way to surprise those who follow the team. Even when we should be accustomed to his performances by now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Our kids.”
Listen to any postgame interview with Harvard women’s hockey coach Katey Stone, and you’re bound to notice that two-word phrase pop up somewhere along the way.
There it was after the Beanpot championship game, a 3-2 Crimson victory over formerly unbeaten Boston College. “We’re thrilled with how our kids played,” Stone said, and the two beaming Harvard players next to her echoed the thought.
The phrase can be an endearment, reserved for special occasions such as last Saturday, when the Crimson booked a plane to the Frozen Four with a 5-0 wipe-down of Quinnipiac. “I’m just really proud of our kids today,” Stone said.
But “our kids” has a more general application. It is the substitute for whatever terminology—“our team,” “our girls,” “our women”—that other women’s ice hockey coaches employ. This means that when Stone reflects on a ECAC championship triumph over Cornell by saying, “I thought our kids got a little bit more jam to their game,” she is setting a unique tone that reverberates throughout the Harvard program and, indeed, defines the two-decade career of the coach with the most total victories in Division I women’s ice hockey history…and counting.
For Katey Stone, coaching is, and always has been, a family affair.
Stone’s father, Larry, worked for decades as the athletic director for Taft School in Connecticut. All three of her siblings have pursued similar paths, including her oldest brother Mike, who has amassed over 700 victories as the head coach of the University of Massachusetts baseball team.
“It’s sort of the family business,” Stone says. “We’ve all gone into coaching and athletics on some level.”
Although Stone’s choice of profession may appear obvious in retrospect, her choice of sport certainly does not. At the University of New Hampshire, Stone split her years between earning ice hockey honors—two-time ECAC winner, one-time all-ECAC selection—and lacrosse awards—two-time All-American, one-time national champion.
But after a few coaching stays at various high schools, Stone chose the ice rink over the lacrosse field. In 1994, she applied for and received the post of longtime Crimson coach John Dooley. Five seasons later, and ten years after graduating from UNH with a degree in physical education, Stone stood on the awards podium with the 1998-99 Harvard team, waiting to celebrate the Crimson’s first and only national championship.
Despite the speed of her ascent, Harvard players insist that Stone maintains a down-to-earth coaching philosophy.
“[In practice] she’s just the same old coach Stone that anyone else sees,” co-captain Samantha Reber said. “She knows when to have fun, but she [also] knows when we need to be serious and focus on the right things.”
After twenty years of collegiate experience, Stone has had the opportunity to apply this demeanor to a long list of national squads, including the American team at the 2014 Winter Olympics. That year, Team USA earned a silver medal after an overtime loss to Canada.
However, Stone’s most impressive accomplishment is likely her work between the boards of Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Heading into the 2014-15 campaign, Stone had earned 402 victories, the highest total in Division-I history. She had won ECAC Coach of the Year three times; she had coached nine ECAC Players of the Year and two four-time All-Americans.
“She is one of the most respected coaches ever,” Reber said. “That goes for both men’s and women’s coaches. To have the honor of playing with her as my coach is something that I hold very near and dear to my heart.”
Such experience is a valuable asset at the Frozen Four, which will take place beneath the weight of increased media scrutiny and one-or-done desperation. However, the Crimson players—Katie’s kids—express confidence in their commander.
“In tight games where we just need her to settle us down, she’s always there to do that,” junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer said. “Coach Stone is calm and collected in a lot of situations, and that’s what we need…. Everyone looks up to her and listens.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brandyn Curry ’13-’14 was on a bus somewhere in Holland. His Dutch team had an 8 p.m.game (three EST) Saturday, so Curry was getting on the bus for an hour-long ride as Yale took a halftime lead over the Harvard men’s basketball team 3700 miles away in the Ivy League playoff game at The Palestra.
When the Crimson rebounded in the second half and eventually grabbed a nine-point lead, the former Harvard point guard breathed a sigh of relief. Ok, he told himself, this is good. Then he hit refresh on his Twitter app, and Yale scored. Another tap and another pair of Yale points.
“I hit refresh again and they are going to the line again,” Curry recalled. “I’m like ‘Oh my God.’ I hit refresh and Duren hit a bucket. I was getting upset, like here we go again. We can’t do this; we can’t do this.”
Just a week earlier, Curry had watched as the Bulldogs held off Harvard in a crucial late-season matchup. Curry had watched all of the team’s Ivy games to that—staying up until 2 a.m. watching online streams—and constantly talked with the team’s current point guard, junior co-captain Siyani Chambers.
But after watching the Crimson lose control of its destiny with the loss to Yale, Curry could not watch the team’s Senior Night game the following night against Brown. He was too upset, and he had an early game the next day. Instead, Curry woke up Sunday morning to a dozen texts, including one from Chambers, explaining that the Bulldogs had lost to Dartmouth on a buzzer beater the night before—that Harvard’s NCAA Tournament chances were still alive.
“Only in the Ivies,” Curry said, who experienced that craziness himself when a Penn loss on the final day of the Ivy season in 2012 sent Harvard dancing for the first time in 66 years.
Fast forward back to Saturday’s playoff, and the Crimson seemed to be losing the opportunity Dartmouth had given them as Yale closed the gap in the game’s final minutes.
“The game was tied and I am refreshing like crazy,” Curry said. “I saw that Moundou-Missi missed a shot and they were trying to decide who it went off of. I’m sitting there just praying they are getting the ball. I refresh again and…”
All this time, Oliver McNally ’12 was playing in the championship game of a basketball tournament in Portland. The former Crimson guard briefly played professionally in Canada before moving to San Francisco to work in sales at a technology company.
While playing in the athletic club tournament, he got updates about the playoff game at every dead ball. Still, he didn’t see how the game ended until he pulled up the highlights on his phone.
When Curry saw that Moundou-Missi had hit the game-winning shot, he jumped up on the bus. The rest of his teammates, resting with their headphones on, all turned to look at him.
“Everybody was looking at me like I’m crazy, but oh well,” Curry said. “I had to explain to them that we were going to March Madness and they understood.”
Curry said he does not have any sympathy for the way Yale’s season came to an end, but McNally, a junior when Harvard lost to Princeton a buzzer-beater in the 2011 Ivy Playoff Game, felt otherwise. He said his first thought upon seeing the highlights was how happy he was for Harvard. But his second thought went out to the Bulldogs.
“I felt awful for the Yale kids and how it went down for them the last two weeks,” he said. “I was on the bad end of a buzzer beater in that playoff game and it’s an awful feeling.”
Curry could have those kinds of mixed feelings Thursday when his local North Carolina Tar Heels face Harvard (Curry went to high school in the Charlotte, N.C., area). He missed the selection show but got a text from former teammate and current assistant coach Christian Webster ’13 asking, “Who are you rooting for?”
Harvard, of course, Curry responded, but he said he was jealous that the Crimson had gotten the matchup, because he would have loved to play against one of his childhood teams.
As for how he thought the team would fare against UNC, Curry said: “Anything is possible in the tournament. If we play our game, go out there and execute, anything is possible.”
McNally was more specific with his prediction. “We take care of the ball, limit UNC on the offensive glass and keep them on the perimeter where they go ice cold,” he said. “In the end, Harvard hangs on 59-57.”
Either way, both said they would be watching, wherever they are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a post Tuesday night, ESPN Insider Jeff Goodman ranked Harvard junior Agunwa Okolie and sophomore Zena Edosomwan among the 10 worst starters in the NCAA tournament. No other team—including all of the 15 and 16 seeds—had two starters ranked among the worst 10. All in all, Okolie ranked 331rd of 340, with Edosomwan coming in just one spot behind.
Okolie and Edosomwan both had lackluster statistical seasons for the Crimson, averaging a combined 8.4 points and 7.1 rebounds—or roughly the output of Northeastern’s Zach Stahl (8.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg), the 299th ranked player on the list.
The Crimson snuck only one player inside the top-250, senior wing Wesley Saunders. Saunders, who had received some fringe Naismith Award buzz earlier in the year, came in at No. 178 despite averaging 16.3 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game while shooting 41 percent from three. Ten spots ahead of Saunders was Georgetown freshman forward L.J. Peak, who averaged 7.8 points and 2.4 rebounds on 38 percent shooting from the field.
Harvard co-captains, junior point guard Siyani Chambers and forward Steve Moundou-Missi, came in at No. 252 and No. 264, respectively.
The list was overall very top heavy. Kentucky placed all five starters within the top-66, while Arizona had all five in the top-80. Harvard’s first-round opponent, the North Carolina Tar Heels, had all five starters ranked in the top-100, headlined by junior point guard Marcus Paige, who ranked No. 29.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most “Crimson Crazies” will tell you that the last time their team played on national television, co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi was jogging back on defense with a face of restrained jubilation after hitting a jumper with 7.2 seconds left to clinch his teams fourth consecutive NCAA tournament berth. While those fans wouldn’t be wrong, they might be a little misguided.
Though ESPN3 did broadcast that 53-51 win over Yale to a national audience, the last time the entire rest of the college basketball world was fixated on the Harvard men’s basketball team (22-7, 11-3 Ivy), the scene was much different. In a December matchup that pitted the Crimson against the undefeated No. 6 Virginia Cavaliers, a sold-out crowd and national audience watched as the Cavaliers toyed with the Crimson, who had been nationally ranked themselves only a couple of weeks prior.
As ESPNU’s Mike Couzens and Dan Dakich began desperately and awkwardly scrambling for anything other than basketball to talk about amidst the 76-27 blowout, one couldn’t help but feel sorry for the Crimson, who failed to reach double digits in the first half. To an outsider, Harvard looked like a lowly Ivy League team that had mistakenly wandered onto the grounds of an almighty ACC, a league home to 12 official NCAA Basketball championships, unable to handle the limelight of such elite competition.
In fact, that same outsider would likely say that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s squad will meet a similar fate when it faces off on national television against perennial powerhouse and No. 4 seed North Carolina. Undeniably, there are plenty of similarities between Thursday night’s matchup and Harvard’s embarrassment in Charlottesville, Va. Having to play another top tier ACC opponent is certainly daunting enough, but doing so on TNT with millions of people watching could spell disaster for the Ancient Eight champions.
While Harvard is certainly the underdog this week, blaming the spotlight instead of the competition after a Crimson loss would be imprudent and misguided.
This season, 28 of the Crimson’s 29 games were broadcast in some format, not to mention the preseason Crimson Madness event televised live on ESPN3 as part of ESPN's Midnight Madness coverage. While a majority of these broadcasts are on the Ivy League Digital Network, expanding in its second year, the Crimson was featured on regional networks like the New England Sports Network and American Sports Network and was visited by ESPN's SportsCenter only a week ago.
This year alone, Harvard has played in 11 regular season games covered on national television, posting a respectable 7-4 record, especially considering three of the losses came against major conference teams.
Nonetheless, just five years ago, Amaker’s squad was only featured in five nationally televised regular season contests.  However, over the past four years, Harvard has played in a total of 48 games that were nationally broadcast, going a solid 28-20 in those big matchups.
As a result, playing in big games has become something of a habit for Amaker’s seniors. Co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year, veteran wing Wesley Saunders, have been a part of it nearly the entire way. The Class of 2015 has already squared up against powerhouse programs such as UConn (three times), Michigan State, New Mexico, Cincinnati, Memphis, and Arizona—all on national television.
While the Tar Heels have certainly played in far more prime time and nationally televised contests than the Crimson this season, this has only been the first or second go-around in March for many of North Carolina’s players. Like Harvard, UNC has lost in its second game of the NCAA tournament the past two seasons, meaning few of its players have more experience in the Big Dance than the Crimson’s.
In fact, only two of the Tar Heels' four seniors were members of their 2012 Elite Eight run and those players played a combined 6.7 minutes per game in their freshman campaigns. Meanwhile, three of Harvard’s key players this season—Moundou-Missi, Saunders, and sophomore Corbin Miller—all logged double-digit minutes their freshman year, the same season Harvard faced SEC champion Vanderbilt on TNT in its opening game of the NCAA tournament.
In other words, North Carolina and Harvard have essentially equal experience playing on the big stage of the tournament, something that more and more Davids have become able to say as they step up to slay Goliath. This has become the recipe for an increasing number of March upsets in recent years as teams filled with upperclassmen are able to frazzle young stars who are blindsided by the bright lights and large audience of the Big Dance.

I've never been to the South before. The "south-est" I've gone is D.C., and I don't think that counts as Southern living. Through PBHA however, I found an opportunity to explore the South and do something worthwhile and meaningful over Spring Break. As a part of the Alternative Spring Break program, I am co-directing the freshman service trip to New Orleans. 
It's been amazing since Day One. On the first day, we landed in the airport at 4 p.m. and immediately took off our winter jackets– I instantly felt liberated (I'm looking at you, Cambridge). After setting down our belongings at Dillard University, where we were staying, we took a walk and explored Frenchmen Street. I then saw the Mississippi River and got a hearty dose of delicious Southern comfort food later that evening. We had dinner with Harvard alumni at The Praline Connection and I gorged myself on fried catfish, mac n cheese, and collard greens. 
The alumni we met with taught us about the work they were doing in the city: some were involved in education, teaching in various schools around the city, another was a part of Grow Dat Youth Farm and was heavily involved with food justice and agriculture in New Orleans, and others were more involved in the politics of New Orleans, helping to rebuild the civic community that had been greatly weakened after Katrina hit. It was an inspiring way to begin our journey. 
The next day, we began work. We had a delicious breakfast of eggs, bacon, grits, and biscuits at Dillard and set off to embark on our service project. We worked to build garden boxes for two local churches, which would help support the community by providing a community center, as well as giving the residents fresh fruits and vegetables to eat. We learned how to use a drill, and together we assembled six boxes from planks of wood. Then we painted the boxes brown, and coated it with clear polyurethane. It was hard but meaningful work. What kept us going through the sweat and heat was the thought that our labor would one day benefit the community. 
 The next day (St. Patrick's Day!), we woke up bright and early and went shopping at Lowe's for fruit-bearing plants, vegetables, and herbs that we planned on planting in the garden boxes. We broke for lunch at Dooky Chase, enjoyed a scrumptious buffet lunch consisting mostly of red beans and fried chicken, and even met Leah Chase herself, the famous chef who owned the restaurant. Then we went back to another church, where we worked on building more garden boxes, painting them, and trying our hand at hammering and using a saw machine. At the end of the day, we walked away with six more freshly painted garden boxes. Since it was St. Patrick's Day, we went to see the parade on Bourbon Street. Considering it was a Tuesday night, it was way more fun than Harvard's most exciting Friday night. People were throwing multicolored beads from the street cars and balconies, music filled the air, and revelry abounded. It was a fantastic sight, and not one to be missed. By far, the best St. Patty's Day I've ever experienced. The trip is far from over, and we still have so much more work to do and so much more of New Orleans to experience, but so far, it's been an absolute blast. The best way to spend Spring Break, hands down.
