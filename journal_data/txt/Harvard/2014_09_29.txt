After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I realized I was black on the first day of kindergarten. After three years of sending me to predominately black schools, my parents decided to put me in an overwhelmingly white private school. No one said anything. Not my classmates, my teachers, or even my parents. But as soon as I set foot in the building, I knew I stood out.
From that day on, everything and everyone around me made it perfectly clear that I was different. Everyone seemed to have a house in some place called the Hamptons and “vacationed” on various beaches in the Caribbean. As a child, I had no way to contextualize this information or discern any real meaning from it. What I did know quite intuitively was that I looked much more like my friends’ babysitters than my friends. I also seemed to have a lot more in common with them.
All the while, no one said anything outright. I made friends, did well in school, and gave off the appearance of a well-adjusted kid in tune with his surroundings. Even as the concept of race began to form in my mind, I thought that only a few shades separated me from my peers. At such a young age, no one thought it necessary to tell me how very different I was from my friends. Instead, my family allowed me a few more years of innocence before thrusting me into reality.
One conversation shattered this notion. On an ordinary Sunday evening, my family told me how to conduct myself around the police. The discussion lasted two full hours, hours filled with personal anecdotes and personal beliefs everyone but me seemed to share. My aunt even had an informative pamphlet on what to do when stopped. When I asked my white friends if they ever had similar talks at home, they seemed baffled. Years later, when I first had a close group of black friends, I asked the same question. We spent the rest of the afternoon sharing stories about how the talk affected our lives.
Black men play by a different set of rules, some codified in drug laws that disproportionately affect the black community and others found in the way media outlets portray the black community at large as thugs, fools, or both. The most damning, however, are found in the hearts and minds of people throughout America and around the world. These unwritten laws portray us as lazy only to make it impossible for us to improve. They make us out to be dangerous no matter what, putting us in danger. They paint black males as predators only to leave us prey to law enforcement.
For a long time, many believed that a select few within the black community could circumvent these laws. By trying to distance ourselves from anything that might connect us to the black community, the argument went, we might be able to escape the trap. When once we might have whistled Vivaldi while passing an elderly white woman on the street, we could now listen to EDM while wearing Nantucket red Chubbies and a new pair of Sperrys.
In high school, after I had become acutely aware of my place in the world, my style changed accordingly. I started to wear button down shirts and Topsiders regularly. Argyle sweaters filled my closet, and my jeans began to fit a bit more snugly. Undoubtedly, some of these changes came from within—all people change in high school. But I will never know whether I truly controlled the changes or they controlled me.
Growing up, you cannot both try to come into your own and fulfill an image of acceptability pressed upon you. To do one you must abandon the other, and in doing the latter you abandon yourself. Societal pressures have forced black men like me to conform or face exile from civilization. There is a reason that few black businessmen have dreadlocks or afros, and it is not because these hairstyles are inherently unprofessional.
Few enlightened people deny the constant burden of living in America as a black person. But forced assimilation will not rectify the situation. In time, I have come to accept that to the world I will always be black first, a person second, and finally, to some, an individual. Many will look at me and see identifiers rather than someone with a unique identity. In a split second, they will see me as a black male and decide who I am for me. No lifestyle change can undo centuries of social programming.
I am tired of trying to quell the fear of every white person I meet. Most do not need it, and I refuse to appease those who still do. For too long, I have lived in fear of the racially charged judgments of my peers. In the process, I may have stunted my individual growth and limited my ability to discover my full potential. I will not be afraid to explore the black tradition and all that it offers just because it might color others’ opinion of me. Too many young black boys will have the opportunity to become black men taken from them. I’m lucky enough still to have that chance, and I also have an obligation to fully discover what it means.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With September coming to an end, it's not just the school year that's back in full swing: The perennial college rankings season is firmly under way, too. But amid the back-and-forth about the value or irrelevance, or even insidiousness, of the sea of competing lists, it is worth revisiting an upcoming ranking that may prove most impactful of all—one whose full details are expected from the White House by the end of the year.
In an attempt to lower the cost of college, the Obama administration is at work on a program to rank colleges according to several factors related to the value of the education they offer. These factors include “tuition, graduation rates, debt and earnings of graduates, and the percentage of lower-income students who attend.”
The rankings would then be tied to federal financial aid, such that students attending colleges with higher ratings would receive larger federal grants and more affordable student loans. By tying aid to the rankings, the plan would very strongly govern the college choices of lower-income students, financially penalizing those who make decisions that do not align with the government’s college rankings. We opined against the folly of this before when it was still just a proposal, and amidst the active debate on the program's merits we continue to hold deep concern about its potential implementation.
Decreasing the cost of college is a noble goal that will benefit lower income families, and a centralized, federal ranking would probably aid students in making good decisions. The White House should make clear, however, the reasoning behind each of its factors, carefully considering possible drawbacks.
Including the earnings of graduates, for example, might make colleges seem objectively better simply for emphasizing more monetarily lucrative majors. Colleges would also be discouraged from spending money on important endeavors that might not improve their rankings, such as community spaces and humanities centers.
Using graduation rates as a factor, while seemingly innocuous on its face, might encourage racial discrimination in the admissions process, as the National Center for Education Statistics reports that white students, on average, are more likely to graduate in four and six years than are black students. It would be troubling to see this proposal encourage colleges to cut back on the number of minority applicants in order to defend themselves against lower retention rates and, under the new ranking system, lower funding.
We also do not see how tying the rankings to aid would decrease the cost of education.
While tuition costs have risen substantially over the past two decades, college revenue has stayed fairly static. This suggests that the rising tuitions are not due merely to universities hiking up costs artificially, so targeting individual colleges probably will not be as effective as uncovering systemic reasons for rising tuitions.
Perhaps most troubling, this already flawed program would limit poor students’ freedom of choice by tying aid to the rankings. While we applaud the White House’s goal of making college more affordable, it should not give itself the right to financially pressure students into making decisions the government feels are appropriate, especially when no such pressure would be exerted on higher-income individuals.
There is no denying that college tuition in this country is a problem, and that making higher education accessible to all Americans is a key step toward greater equality. But due to its many unresolved concerns regarding the factors it uses and its discriminatory impact on low-income students, the White House’s proposal seems an ineffective solution.

If a modern Dante were to write the Inferno for introverts, specifically, he would probably paint a picture of something similar to opening week of college.
For introverts, the greatest battle is between the desire to not miss out on life and the craving to be alone. The frenzy of orientation week, with its constant social events and a thousand introductions a day, can be incredibly overwhelming for people who get drained easily by social activity.
As an introverted freshman myself last year, I simply felt, well, peopled out. Despite the knowledge that I had to get out of the room to meet new people and expose myself to my surroundings, I quickly tired of all the meaningless introductions with people whose names and faces faded immediately after. Most of all, conforming to the standard of what a Harvard student should be doing left me disconnected from the person I really was.
For most students entering college, there is a certain preconceived image of what college students should be doing. Those activities include: laughing uproariously with friends in the Yard while wearing stylish aqua-green rompers from Teen Vogue; partying it up in frat houses with red Solo cups amidst sun-bleached hair; and attending every visiting dignitary’s speaking event at the IOP. Those prescribed activities did not include reading a book alone, crying from homesickness, or feeling intimidated by the incessant stream of social activity.
As someone who entered with those same preconceptions, my initial thought was that I was simply not suited to the college environment. I like reading poetry and drinking tea with a small group of trusted people. It is hard for me to not check my phone during IOP forums, much to my own dismay. From my dorm window, I would hear the sound of people laughing in the yard, people that I should be joining in their small talk and socializing, but I simply couldn’t muster the energy to.
It made me think of the very first time I went to a conference with adults, confronted with pantsuits and business cards. I went into the bathroom and splashed myself in the face, admonishing my own reflection in the mirror, “You are adept at socializing in large groups. You have lots of business cards, which makes you adept at socializing in large groups.” The bathroom attendant looked at me in confusion.
Saying it, however, didn’t make it true.
So here’s my advice for the introverts of the Class of 2018: Don’t push it. There will be plenty of opportunity to make friends at any point in time—plenty of opportunities more suited to forming genuine connections than those initial weeks of mass introductions.
Furthermore, don’t feel pressured to be social the same way everyone else is, especially if it isn’t your scene. You will not miss out on life or on college simply by taking a much-needed break.
Rest assured, no matter what you do, you will still make friends. You will make plenty of friends, in the most unexpected of ways. Through your roommates, through clubs you never join, through chance encounters in the dining hall, and even if you never go to a single finals club, you will still be doing college right.
One of my longstanding dreams ever since I visited Harvard was to sit in the Yard under a tree and write. And in fact, one of favorite experiences my freshman fall was sitting under a tree in the Yard with an old notebook and a couple of fellow introverts, one of whom had a guitar, sipping tea from our ironic red Solo cups. There is room, within the ivy-laden walls of Harvard, to take a break from the noise and the people and to just be yourself.
So carry through, fellow introverts. Despite the seeming hell of opening week, you can take time to be alone, without feeling alone.

The murders of American journalists, British aid workers, and countless others at the hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have prompted much discussion about what makes this group tick.  Some have reached thoughtful conclusions about ISIL’s conscious desire to unsettle our core sensibilities; David Brooks was cogent on this point. But other reflections have indulged in caricatures, and have perpetuated misunderstandings of how the group should be understood.
Andrea Tantaros of Fox News, for example, mused: “And they’ve been doing this for hundreds and hundreds of years. If you study the history of Islam. Our ship captains were getting murdered. The French had to tip us off. I mean these were the days of Thomas Jefferson.”
This comment gets a lot wrong, but most striking is its ignorance of what was happening in Europe at the time of the Barbary Wars, the late 18th and early 19th century conflicts to which Tantaros was referring. In the year that Congress commissioned the first ships of the United States Navy to deal with North African piracy, France was experiencing the Reign of Terror, making it the period’s world capital of beheadings. Incidentally, that episode of social turmoil gave us the word “terrorist.”
Tantaros’ comment is low-hanging fruit in the historical ignorance department. But the idea that ISIL is a purely Islamic phenomenon, reflecting a kind of brutality unknown to other cultures, deserves debunking. Far from being uniquely Islamic, ISIL represents the ugly face that societies tend to manifest when their modes of social, political, and religious organization become unsustainable.
Take, for instance, the destruction wrought by the power politics and religious fundamentalism of the Thirty Years War. According to one count, “perhaps 20 percent of Germany’s total population perished during the war.” And Europe’s internal violence did not end there: something on the order of 3 million people died in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, followed by the tens of millions in the two World Wars. To round out the eerie parallels between all forms of radicalism, Hitler’s henchmen brought the guillotine out of retirement.
During the early modern period, the non-European world was hardly calm. Tens of millions died in numerous upheavals in China; the Mexican Revolution claimed probably one million lives. From 1861 to 1865, the United States chose to settle its central ideological dispute by wiping out about two percent of its population.
Of course, saying that death tolls from ISIL and in Syria more broadly – about 10,000 and 200,000, respectively – are not on par with history’s worst conflicts is not an argument that ISIL should be ignored or treated as anything less than evil. But looking at it in the context of major social dislocations, it appears not as an aberration, but as the kind of murderous tendency that often overtakes cultures in the midst of profound internal conflict.
Here, the Thirty Years War analogy may be particularly useful. As religious scholar Reza Aslan has noted, what is happening in present-day Islam resembles the 16th century Christian Reformation, with “a mess of different interpretations and ideas in conflict with each other.” The analogy is far from perfect, but the image of Abu Bakr el-Baghdadi, ISIL’s leader, giving a sermon in occupied Mosul is not dissimilar to, say, an Anabaptist leader in 1635 Munster attempting to forge his own polity.
The admittedly crude parallels between 21st century Iraq and Syria and 17th century Germany suggest that a very long process is playing out in the Middle East. Between the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 and the end of World War II in 1945, Europe managed to self-immolate at least three more times. China had a similar experience between the fall of the Ming in 1644 and the relaxation of Communist dogma after the 1960s.
The current unrest in the Near East needn’t be as violent as the Eurasian experience; outside influence has a role in making sure the tensions in the Arab and wider Islamic worlds resolve themselves as peacefully as possible. But the reordering of Middle Eastern states and societies is ultimately the task of Middle Eastern people; and if history is any guide, ISIL will not be the last savage faction to arise from that process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President of Ghana John Dramani Mahama described the arrival of a “new frontier” of economic growth and political stability for his Western African country in a speech at the Institute of Politics on Friday.
Opening with a quotation from President John F. Kennedy ’40, Mahama expressed his optimism for Ghana’s future to a capacity audience at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
“We stand today on the edge of a new frontier...a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils—a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats,” Mahama said, echoing then-senator Kennedy’s 1960 speech accepting the Democratic nomination for president.
“That new frontier to which Kennedy was saying was the decade of the 1960s,” Mahama continued. “But those words he used there can just as easily describe the challenges and the opportunities we are facing now, in this current era.”
Mahama described Ghana’s history as the first sub-saharan African nation to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957. The president discussed the extent to which the country has changed since gaining independence, especially emphasizing the dramatic economic and political improvements of the last decade.
“Flash forward ten years to 2012, now it’s ten years of political stability, ten years of fiscal responsibility, ten years of uninterrupted social intervention programs, ten years of investor confidence,” Mahama said.
He also stressed that by 2012, Ghana had been named one of the top five growing economies in the world. Ghana currently ranks thirteenth in the world for real gross domestic product growth rate, according to the Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook.
Mahama cited a shifting international view of Africa, especially in recent media coverage aiming to showcase positive developments in the region.
“I’m happy to note that the international media attitude toward Africa is changing,” he said “Before, Africa was mentioned in the media only when there was conflict or there was a famine or an outbreak of Ebola.”
Mahama acknowledged the importance of learning from the past in moving toward the future.
“This is the part where the past imposes itself on the present,” Mahama said. “The past, where you see the beauty and brightness of your destination, but you cannot move forward until you have fixed the problems that for years have been ignored, delayed, or only have [been] addressed.”
After fielding questions from audience members for more than 30 minutes after the conclusion of his speech on topics ranging from the Ebola virus to African travel restrictions, Mahama ended the forum by apologizing for not having more time to talk with attendees.
“I check my email, and I will respond to your questions,” Mahama announced, spelling out his personal email address to all 700 people in attendance.
“Not one [speaker] before [Mahama] has given out their email address,”  Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 added to laughter and applause from the audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council representatives officially censured the recent decision to withhold Q Guide difficulty ratings from students and passed legislation that would require the publication of internal voting and attendance records at the Council's weekly meeting Sunday evening.
The meeting marked the first official Council-wide gathering of the fall semester and featured 44 new Council members who were elected just two weeks ago.
Clad in what appears to have become his outfit of choice for Council meetings—a Napoleonic style uniform and sheathed plastic sword—UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos '15 delivered a passionate yet humor-laden speech emphasizing the unique position he believes the UC has this year to influence change as the University implements a new sexual misconduct policy and honor code.
The first piece of legislation, brought to the Council by Quincy resident Brett M. Biebelberg '16, came in response to widespread outrage from undergraduates last year when they learned that the Faculty Council had voted to remove difficulty ratings from the Q Guide.
The act, which endorsed a position paper written by UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal '16, was eventually passed unanimously after representatives debated the best way to communicate with administrators, who are worried that  students might misuse difficulty ratings.
The position paper asks that the implementation of the change be pushed to fall 2015 because the “decision was poorly communicated.” It also mandates the UC to push for increased transparency and inclusion of student voice in Faculty Council decisions that directly affect undergraduates.
To that end, the UC is asking the Faculty Council to reveal docketed items pertaining to undergraduate education to relevant UC committees within two weeks of a vote, and allow for the inclusion of student voice. Either, if implemented, would mark an unprecedented change to the Faculty Council’s procedures, which are typically left confidential.
UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy '16, for his part, did not convey opposition to the act, but emphasized during debate that the demands on the Faculty Council constituted a “large ask."
Responding to a question about whether the UC should advocate for the position of a student representative on the Faculty body, Biebelberg openly acknowledged, “frankly, I don’t see that happening.”
The UC also unanimously passed legislation intended to improve the transparency of the Council itself. The “Council Legislation to Enhance Accountability and Reliability," or CLEAR Act, will make attendance and voting records, in addition to up to three campaign priorities of each UC representative, available on the Council's website.
“It’s very significant because people deserve to know exactly what the UC is up to and how their reps are performing, and it’s especially important that we change the culture of promising big things, but never following up on them,” said Vice President Sietse K. Goffard '15, who called the act “long overdue.”
The UC also passed its first wave of grants for the semester. A formalized budget will be brought before the Council next week, according to Kanuparthy.
Current UC Secretary Stephen A. Turban '17 also formally announced at the meeting that he has stepped down as secretary. In an interview after the meeting, Turban said he wished to pursue other roles on the Council. The secretary and rules committee chair positions, in addition to the Council Parliamentarian role, will be filled in the coming weeks, according to Mayopoulos and Goffard.

UPDATED: September 20, 2014, at 4:23 p.m.
Former Chair of the Anthropology Department Irven DeVore, who taught generations of Harvard undergraduates a lotteried class popularly known as “Sex," died last Tuesday of cardiac failure. He was 80.
During his 37-year tenure at Harvard, DeVore chaired the Anthropology Department and directed the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. However, he was best known to undergraduates as the instructor of Science B-29: "Human Behavioral Biology," usually referred to by students as "Sex." According to a 2001 ariticle in Harvard Magazine, almost a third of students who passed through the College from 1970 to 2000 took the class, which amounts to between 12,000 and 15,000 students.
The Texas-born scholar studied indigenous people in Botswana, hunter-gatherers in Democratic Republic of the Congo, and baboons in Kenya. Scholars in the field, who taught with or studied under him said DeVore was one of the founders of modern behavioral biology as applied to human beings.
Terrence W. Deacon, now an anthropology professor at the University of California, Berkeley, co-taught Science B-29 with DeVore.
“He was a very difficult person to teach with, in part because he was so good,” Deacon said. “He was a great story-teller with his southern accent and calm demeanor.”
According to Deacon, DeVore started an initiative called the “Simian Seminar” at his home in Cambridge, Mass., where prominent scholars in the field made presentations on their latest research in his living room.
“The field of biological anthropology really was developed almost in his living room. It was an incredible place where new ideas in the field took place,” Deacon said.
Gregory T. Laden, who earned his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1992, was one of DeVore’s advisees. According to Laden, DeVore almost “single-handedly invented the field of primate studies,” and was instrumental to bringing more women into a traditionally male-dominated field.
“At Harvard in the 1960s, if you were a woman in graduate school you couldn’t sit in a seminar. You had to sit in the hallway,” Laden said. “DeVore launched more women in their careers than there were in the entire field for several other institutions.”
Sarah B. Hrdy ’68, an anthropology professor at the University of California, Davis, was DeVore’s first female graduate student. According to Hrdy, DeVore was a “fabulous lecturer” who was a “master” at commanding his audience.
“He had a...gift for spotting talents,” Hrdy said. “He was a catalyst in giving people free rein to just go out there and do things.”
Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology and a former student of DeVore’s, said DeVore was a “delightful, kind, and nurturing” professor who had an “infectious enthusiasm for the subject.”
“He was extremely avuncular…. His door was always open, and he was never too busy to help anybody. He was sort of like everybody’s advisor,” Lieberman said.
DeVore is survived by his wife, daughter, and grandchildren. No memorial service has been scheduled to date.

Wearing a bright pink skirt and a midriff top, Disha Verma ’15, president of the Harvard U.S. India Initiative, holds a sign that reads “This is NOT an invitation” over her chest. This bright photo of Verma standing tall is juxtaposed with an image of her sitting in a chair, fully-clothed in Indian traditional dress, holding a sign that reads “Does this make my message more meaningful?”
The photo appears on the Tumblr of the “emBODYindia” photo campaign, a blog launched to open dialogue about issues related to rape and sexual assault in Indian society by the Harvard U.S. India Initiative. After launching the photo campaign last Thursday—and garnering the participation of students, tutors, and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—some of the faces at the forefront of the campaign explained their inspiration for appearing in the Tumblr.
More so in India than in the west, a woman’s character is judged by her clothing choice, said Upasna Sharma ’15, one of the participants in the emBODYindia campaign.
Holding a sign that reads "not needed: your value judgement," Sharma wears a white t-shirt and blue shorts in a photo for the campaign—an outfit that she said she would feel uncomfortable wearing on the streets of her native New Dehli.
Expressing similar sentiments, Verma said that how you dress in India is a real safety issue for women.
“One of my favorite parts of coming to the U.S. is that I can stop worrying about what I'm wearing,” Verma said. She added that she leaves most of her clothes at Harvard when she returns home to New Delhi during school breaks. She said she worries that they would attract too much negative attention.
"The vast majority of Indian society thinks that if you dress scantily, you are inviting criticism. What you wear does not ever equate to an invitation," she said.
Aditya Agrawal ’17, one of the many male students involved in the photo campaign, said the photos are a response to systemic issues of female objectification and sexual assault in India.
"There is a societal dysfunction in India where women are always in [the] possession of someone else," he said. "A large population of Indian men feel entitled to a woman's body."
Agrawal, who is from Lucknow, India, said rape is so common in his city that it doesn't even make the pages of his local newspaper.
The photo campaign aims to change the pervasive mindset in India that leads to objectification and violation of women, organizers said, opening dialogue in India about taboo subjects surrounding sex.
"In India, the blame is always on the woman, not the person objectifying the woman," Sharma said. "It's often [perceived as] our fault for provoking behavior."
The Harvard U.S. India Initiative is in the process of collaborating with students from around the world—as well as with a national campaign for women’s rights in India called No Country for Women—in the hopes of building long-term impact in changing Indian attitudes towards women.
While the photo campaign is primarily targeted toward the audience in India, Verma said the campaign transfers well to Harvard's campus and that it "struck a chord" with many women at here.
"The final clubs are very gender segregated. When they're deciding 'should we let her in or not', they're basing it on her looks," she said. "In a situation where girls have to line up to gain access, an environment of objectification is sadly bound to ensue: different symptoms, same problem. "

At halftime of every game, the Harvard men’s soccer team (5-3) huddles on its own. Forwards meet with forwards; defenders cluster nearby. Amongst themselves, each position unit goes over the last 45 minutes of play—noting the needed adjustments. Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer encourages the players to make adjustments on the field, making only minor additions to their conclusions.
After the Crimson comeback from a two-goal deficit for the second straight game, a 3-2 overtime win over Massachusetts (1-6), it’s safe to say the adjustments are the right ones.
“It’s really amazing what they have done,” Lehrer said, following his team’s fifth consecutive victory. “A lot of what we do and implement is about them thinking and them making decisions on the field. The system is very much about them making the adjustments and teaching them what tactic to apply in what situation.”
As on Tuesday, when Harvard scored three goals in 16 minutes to steal a victory from Boston College, the Crimson fell behind early against Massachusetts. Two early Minutemen goals—a penalty kick from Josh Schwartz and a Mark Morris rocket from 30 yards out—put Harvard in a 2-0 hole just 17 minutes into the contest.
The Crimson hardly blinked.
“After the second goal they scored, we gathered the team on the field and there was no doubt, no disappointment and lack of confidence,” junior co-captain Mark Ashby said. “We had full confidence we were going to come back and win that game.”
The comeback started on the defensive end. After connecting on its first two shots, Massachusetts would not get off another shot for the next 80 minutes. Ashby and the rest of the back line moved forward, cutting off avenues of attack and maintaining possession.
What followed was a historic onslaught of shots. Harvard launched 33 shots, 21 on goal. Forwards Jake Freeman and Tyler Savitsky had five apiece as the Crimson challenged Minutemen goalkeeper Ryan Buckingham time and time again. It broke through for the first time in the 40th minute, when Freeman got his head on a loose ball and poked it through to cut the deficit to one.
“I think in this game especially we needed to be more patient with the ball and we had more success by using our center midfielders,” Ashby said. “Although we were down two goals, we were trying not to be desperate and make sure we were patient with the ball.”
Harvard went up a man just seven minutes into the second half when Massachusetts sophomore Luke Pavone was sent off. Nine seconds later, the Crimson capitalized when freshman midfielder Sam Brown found sophomore forward Daniel Smith on the ensuing free kick. Smith’s header into the back of the net squared the game at two.
Buckingham buckled down, and Harvard’s constant pressure—including 11 shots in nine minutes at one point—did not yield the decider in regular time. Come extra time, where Harvard is 2-0 on the year, the Crimson quickly took advantage, however.
Capturing possession quickly, Harvard pushed upfield, its efforts yielding a corner kick. There, junior forward Andrew Chang—the hero on Tuesday—found senior forward Hiroki Kobayashi amongst a crowd in the box. Kobayashi’s header rung true—flying past Buckingham to complete Harvard’s third comeback in five games.
“[Kobayashi’s] work rate has gone through the roof and that has really changed his whole game,” Lehrer said. “He works hard defensively, he makes a lot of hard through runs and he follows up shots. His commitment to really being a more complete player has helped…. He has improved tremendously.”
After the game, Lehrer noted that it took a year before the team was fully comfortable making its own adjustments at halftime. However, with the team closing its non-conference schedule on a five-game, 16-7 run, he noted that they now get it right “99 percent of the time”.
“That type of change is where they take hold of the team and they really draw in the process of what we do during halftime,” Lehrer said. “A big reason for why they have so much success is that they put so much into it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time this season, the Harvard men’s water polo team (7-4, 3-2 CWPA) was able to play in the familiar water of Blodgett Pool.  The weekend was a mixed result with the Crimson splitting the four games that it played.
HARVARD 10, FORDHAM 8
Harvard continued the success it found on Saturday evening with a 10-8 win over Fordham (8-5) on Sunday morning.
An equal balance of strong defense and offense on the part of both teams left the score deadlocked at two after the first quarter. Sophomore attackers Viktor Wrobel and Joey Colton contributed goals for the Crimson.
In what became a trend in this game, both teams traded goals within the first 30 seconds of the second quarter to keep the score tied.  However, junior goalie Colin Woolway made crucial saves in the second quarter to give Harvard some breathing room with a 7-4 lead going into the third quarter.
The lead was trimmed to two goals entering the fourth quarter, with the Crimson leading the Rams 8-6.  An even two goals each in the fourth quarter eventually led to a 10-8 victory for Harvard.  Offensively, junior 2-meter Ben Zepfel led the way with three goals.
HARVARD 10, IONA 4
After a loss earlier in the day, the Crimson looked to get back on a positive note, and they succeeded as Harvard was victorious against Iona (2-6).  After a relatively slow first period, the Crimson took a 6-1 lead into halftime, thanks to goals from Colton and sophomore defender Dan Stevens among others.
Harvard’s defense also played a large role in only allowing the Gaels one goal in the first 16 minutes of play.
Colton added on two more goals in the third quarter to give the Crimson a sizeable 5 goal lead at 8-3.  Iona was only able to add one more goal in the final quarter, leading to a 10-4 victory for Harvard and its first victory in CWPA Northern Division play.
HARVARD 8, ST. FRANCIS 12
The Crimson got off to a tough start Saturday afternoon when the team fell 12-8 to St. Francis (3-6).  In a heated and physical game, the Terriers gained momentum early with a 4-1 start.  At multiple points during the contest, the referees had to step in and keep the match under control.
After Harvard brought the score to 4-2, a breakaway and scoring opportunity for St. Francis in the closing seconds of the first quarter fell short, but a difficult save kept it at 4-2. At many points in the ensuing second and third quarters, the Terriers extended the lead to at most four goals and was close to running away with the game.
However, the Crimson was able to keep the game close by pulling within a goal on several occasions. Harvard managed to tie the game at 7 with 5:43 left to play in the fourth quarter.  But 17 seconds later, St. Francis responded and regained the lead which it never let go of until the final buzzer rang.
“We were well prepared,” Stevens said.  “However, there were lacking fundamentals in our defensive positions that cost us the game against St. Francis.  But we will adapt and improve.”
HARVARD 8, BROWN 13
The fourth and final match that rounded out the weekend of play for Harvard was against No. 14 and Ivy League foe, Brown (11-3).  A very well contested first quarter ended with a 2-1 lead for the Bears.  However, offense was much more easily seen in the second quarter where seven goals were scored, ending in a 6-4 lead for Brown.  The heated game led to multiple ejections in the third quarter for the Crimson, allowing the Bears to pull away.  In the end, the Bears won 13-8.
“We’re doing well but we’re still figuring things out,” Woolway said, “We have the talent and capability to do really well but we need to put it all together.  This weekend will give us a reason to work harder.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by the performances of junior Tom Purnell and senior Whitney Thronburg, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams hung tough with some of the nation’s top teams in Friday’s Coast to Coast Battle in Beantown.
The race featured various teams from around the nation, from Ivy League rivals to national running powerhouses, giving the Crimson a great gauge for future races at both the league and national level.
“It’s always good to go up against some of the nation’s best,” head coach Jason Saretsky said. “I always try to emphasize that if you learn from these experiences, it’s going to make you stronger and better prepared for those future challenges, and I feel like we were able to do that across the board.”
The Harvard men finished sixth out of nineteen teams and the women took eighth out of twenty-one.
Purnell led the Crimson by keeping pace with the top pack for most of the race and finished the 8k course in 13th place with a time of 24:45, just 25 seconds behind first place Eric Jenkins, an All-American from Oregon.
The race served as a rebound performance for the junior, who posted his best time of the season with a 25 second improvement after struggling two weeks ago at Yale.
“We talked after the race [H-Y-P] and it was very clear that that was not the level he was at, and we were very determined to fix some of the things that were off,” Saretsky said. “This was a great bounce back performance by him, and I think that it left him feeling there’s more still to come.”
Senior co-captain Will Geiken led the men with a 30th place overall finish while clocking in third for Harvard with a time of 25:01.
“My personal mindset was that I wanted to improve upon my race from H-Y-P,” said Geiken. “I wanted to see how I could match up with the other guys in the race.”
On the women’s side, the Crimson were led by Thornburg, who broke the 18-minute mark in a 5k race for the first time in her career with a thirty-ninth place finish and a time of 17:56.
“Whitney has been a great success story for us and the product of just sheer determination and a real love for the sport,” Saretsky said. “She’s developed and progressed throughout her four-year career, and it’s exciting to see all that hard work paying dividends. I’m really looking forward to seeing her finish off her senior year on a high note.”
The meet also served to demonstrate the young talent the team has, as the freshmen continued to provide a strong showing despite being exposed to some of the top runners in the sport.
While both races attracted top talent—the men’s race featured three top 25 teams (#3 Oregon, #8 Syracuse, and #16 Providence) and the women’s race featured five (#1 Michigan, #5 Georgetown, #14 Syracuse, #17 Boston College, and #25 Dartmouth)—that did not seem to intimidate the young Crimson athletes, as each side featured two freshman in the top seven.
On the men’s side, Louis Colson and Ben Huffman finished fourth and fifth, a second apart from each other at 25:31 and 25:32, respectively, for Harvard also good for sixtieth and sixty-first overall.
For the women, Courtney Smith, at 18:04, and Elianna Shwayder, at 18:26, finished third and seventh, respectively, for the Crimson and forty-ninth and eighty-eighth overall. The times were personal bests for Huffman and Shwayder.
“Our freshmen have been stellar for us in both races. On the men’s side, it’s an even bigger adjustment getting used to the 8K,” Saretsky said. “We are really excited to see the contributions that those freshmen are making and are looking forward to when they get more used to college, more used to different training…. There’s a really bright future for them.”
With valuable experience gained from this meet, the Harvard runners next head out to compete in the Paul Short Invitational, hosted by Lehigh University, on October 4th.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although it had been over four months since the five members representing Harvard women’s golf at the Yale Invitational had last teed off in tournament play, the team did not show much rust in a second-place showing at the three-day event.
Sandwiched between a Yale team playing on its own course and Xavier in the final results, Harvard came up just short of denying the Bulldogs their second straight title at their own invitational.
“This was the first tournament that a lot of us have played in four months, and it was really exciting for us,” sophomore Anne Cheng said. “It’s been awhile because a lot of us didn’t play a ton of golf over the summer compared to a lot of other schools. Coming out to this tournament, we felt…we did better than we expected.”
The 16-team field brought various East Coast schools to New Haven for three rounds at the par-71 Course at Yale and also included fellow Ivy League competitors Penn, Brown, and Dartmouth, who finished fifth, eighth, and 12th, respectively.
Keyed by an improvement in their total score each day of the tournament, the Bulldogs grabbed the lead on Saturday and never relinquished it en route to the tournament title.
Leading Harvard to a second-place finish was junior Christine Lin, who took fourth.
“For quite a long time, I think I lacked this inner confidence,” Lin said. “[But] this weekend I really trusted my game and mentally I was very strong, and that carried through with the results, and I just stayed patient, and played pretty well.”
The Crimson teed off strong on the first day, recording a composite score of 298, just a stroke behind the Musketeers for the day one lead and a stroke ahead of the Bulldogs. Lin paced the group with a one-over-par 72, while senior Brenna Nelsen was just a stroke behind her teammate after carding a 73, just three shots off the individual lead.
“I think we all knew what we needed to focus on,” Lin said. “We all had a lot of confidence in ourselves, even though the results weren’t showing leading up to the weekend. We were very in our element and had great composure on the course, and I thought we dealt with playing conditions quite well.”
But Yale leapfrogged the top-two teams on day two, posting a score of 295 to take the lead headed into the final day.
Championship Sunday saw much of the same, with the Bulldogs pulling away with a score of 293, a tournament low for all teams, and five strokes ahead of Harvard. Yale sophomore Elisabeth Bernabe posted a final round score of two-under-par, edging Xavier’s Shane Crutchfield for the individual title.
The Crimson in total placed four players in the top ten individually. Junior Courtney Hooton finished tied for sixth after carding a 72 on Sunday, while Nelsen and Chang—who took home the individual title at last year’s Ivy League Championship—finished tied for tenth.
Though Coach Kevin Rhoads was absent for the final day of play as he was with the men’s team at another tournament, his influence was still felt by the members of the team.
“[Rhoads] passed on a message telling us that… we haven’t been out in four months playing a tournament, and he thought we did very well in focusing on the things we could control and putting ourselves in a tournament mode,” Lin said.
Having shaken off some of the stiffness leftover from a summer off from sanctioned competition, the Harvard women are looking to make a run at a title at the Penn State Invitational next week. Part of reaching that goal will rely on the methods that brought them to a solid finish at New Haven.
“We stayed ready on the course this entire week,” Cheng said. “We focused on our process, did our own things, and tried our best.”
