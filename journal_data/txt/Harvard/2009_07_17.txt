EAST HADDAM, Conn. — In 1958, lyricist Alan Jay Lerner ’40 suggested to composer Frederick Loewe that they turn T.H. White’s novel about King Arthur, The Once and Future King, into a musical. “You must be crazy,” Loewe replied, “That king was a cuckold.” (A “cuckhold” is a fogeyish term for an adulteress’s husband.) Arthur had lost his wife, Guenevere, to his best friend, Lancelot. “Who the hell cares about a cuckold?” Loewe asked.
More people than he thought. Last weekend, a revival of Lerner and Loewe’s musical, “Camelot,” opened at the Goodspeed Opera House. Although the production is only in preview season, it is already a delight. 
The story follows the Arthurian legend: Arthur (Bradley Dean) marries Guenevere (Erin Davie) to unite war-torn England. To secure peace, Arthur establishes the Knights of the Round Table, who use “might for right.” Entranced by this utopia, a French knight, Lancelot (Maxime de Toledo), leaves his native country to join Arthur’s court. Lancelot becomes the king’s right-hand man—and the queen’s secret lover. Guenevere and Lancelot try to hide their romance, but Arthur’s bastard son, Mordred (Adam Shonkwiler), craving a slice of his father’s kingdom, reveals their infidelity and dismantles the Table. 
It’s a riveting story, but it has to be done right. Lerner’s script combines a romance novel with a political treatise—sometimes awkwardly. Despite this challenge, the actors capture their characters’ essence. Dean radiates sincerity. When he is pondering in his study, he stomps his feet to trace his line of thought. When he is cursing Merlyn (Herman Petras) for never teaching him how to handle a woman, he twitches in anger. And when he is telling Davie that he wants to be “the wisest, most heroic, most splendid king who ever sat on any throne,” the audience believes him.
Director Robert Ruggiero keeps his staging within Lerner’s outlines, which set designer Michael Schweikardt fills with color. To this portrait, costume designer Alejo Vietti adds a dab of earth tones. The men stride in fur-lined, verdant coats; the women frolic in pastel, summer dresses. But Vietti achieves his greatest efficacy in his simplest combinations. When Guenevere meets Arthur in a wintry forest, she dons a white cloak, highlighting her long red hair. The contrast accentuates Guenevere’s fiery passion—the reason that men find her irresistible.
Although Ruggiero’s staging is masterful, his interpretation of the production, as stated in the playbill, misses the thrust of the show. Ruggiero puts the spotlight on the “layered relationships of King Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot rather than…some epic idea.” But the hero of “Camelot” is not Arthur himself; it is his institution: the rule of law.
Ironically, Ruggiero’s staging, which he hopes will underline the characters’ humanity, stresses the musical’s larger message: Civilization requires restraint. Arthur is a great king not because he feels emotion as all of us do, but because he resists emotion, as few of us do. He resists emotion to build something greater, the rule of law. When he decides to forgive Guenevere, he declares, “This is the time of King Arthur, when violence is not strength and compassion is not weakness.” At the finale, Arthur speaks to a boy who promises to tell the king’s story after Arthur dies. Elated, Arthur concludes, “I’ve won my battle! What we did will be remembered.”
The ideal of Camelot is that the rule of law can exist without a charismatic leader and in the minds of the people. Camelot is supposed to be permanent. That said, Lerner and Loewe’s “Camelot” plays only until September, and theater-goers should relish it. Ruggiero may misinterpret Arthur’s story, but he tells it beautifully. His production is, in Lerner’s words, “one brief shining moment.”

ANHUI, China – The village of Hongcun is built in the shape of a water buffalo. The tour guide led us through winding streets, reminding us that it was easy to get lost in the corridors that formed the cow’s intestines. I wandered ahead to talk to the artist sitting on his stoop painting the rooftops. In between brushstrokes he and his friends told me to go to Yunnan. I hung back to watch the tourist lazily holding his camera instead of pointing it at the swans in the pond, deciding whether I could photograph his bored expression unnoticed.
The guide waved me back to the group. When he led us into a temple, I slipped out a back door. 
On the other side of the wall, narrow paths led to houses and small shops selling playing cards, cold drinks, Mao’s red book. I stopped at a table with three bamboo waterwheels. The man carving another at a bench farther from the road came over and showed me how to turn the level so the twisting wheel would touch off the tiny hammers. He told me he spent three days carving each one. I didn’t know how to transport one of these to Hong Kong without breaking it. He took me inside his house to offer tea and show me his other pieces. The most elaborate had ladders and gazebos. Spread over the table, they suggested a miniature amusement park. 
Mine made it through the flight to Beijing, but only that far, since I accidentally left the contraption, hidden in the bag he gave me to protect it, at the hotel. Was his price of 70 yuan, just over 10 U.S. dollars, a fair cost for three days work? The lesson that hits me at every turn in China returns: I really don’t know.  Instead, glimpses from getting lost in bovine entrail-avenues, or in what was taught about equitable wages, collect into impressions that take the place of understanding.

ARUSHA, Tanzania — As I prepared to live in rural Tanzania for eight weeks, I knew not to have particularly high expectations about the food I would encounter there. Two weeks of orientation seemed to prove me right—we were served the same beef stew, which had more bones in it than actual meat, every single night. Sometimes we hard-working volunteers had to subsist on only makande for lunch, a stew of maize and beans.  Needless to say, I was less than satisfied.
Once we got to the villages, the culinary customs started to get even stranger. Our first morning in the homestay, I was handed a plate of peanuts for breakfast. Legumes and instant coffee? Not my favorite way to start the day. Some of my friends brought jam to their families as a gift, and on their second night, found themselves extending their hands to be served a spoonful of it to eat plain. 
In the three weeks since I've been here, though, I've started to appreciate a lot of aspects of the Tanzanian diet. Most notably, the fruit. Turns out bananas in America aren't really bananas—they're poor imitations of what real ndizi, picked from the tree and sold in a village marketplace, are like. My homestay baba grows avocadoes and oranges in the backyard, so we have some with almost every meal. Chapati, which is basically a thin, African version of naan, is delicious (at least until you're forced to consume six of them by your overbearing mama, who insists that you aren't eating enough food). And I have even started to develop a fondness for rice and beans – which is good, because if I didn't, I would definitely go hungry.
What I didn't anticipate, though, is how much I'd miss American dishes. Daily, the other three international volunteers living in my village and I engage in conversations that could only be described as one thing: food porn. Cookie dough ice cream? McDonald's cheeseburgers? Bagels with cream cheese? Felipe's burritos? You name it, we've fantasized about it. In fact, it's gotten to the point where I had a dream the other night about a chocolate shop. While we're in the city on our weekends off, us internationals hop from Western establishment to Western establishment, in search of the perfect solution to our culinary cravings. It's hard to find; Cream cheese and chocolate just don't taste the same in Africa. I know that when I get back to my village on Sundays, I will be met with a giant plate of food, and my family will sit and watch me eat until I've finished every last bite. “Nimesheba”—“I'm full”—is a foreign concept to them. So, I will once again eat six chapati a day and pray that my digestive system can hold up.
And the one item I've come to appreciate more than any other food? It’s the only piece of America I can bring to my homestay—a good, old-fashioned PB&J.

Harvard College Library, whose administrators have spoken of the need to make organizational changes and "rebuild" after last month's staff reductions, has announced a series of minor service changes in the past few weeks affecting the Fung, Pusey, and Fine Arts Libraries. The Fung Library—which houses collections for the Weatherhead Center, the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, the Documentation Center for Contemporary Japan, and the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies—has restricted circulation of its collection materials to in-house use only, as of July 14. The library will no longer be a delivery point for Harvard Depository materials owned by other libraries as of July 7, and materials from other libraries cannot be called to Fung either. Furthermore, Fung will no longer provide course reserve materials beginning in the fall. Those materials will now be provided at Lamont Library instead."These were budget-driven changes," said HCL spokeswoman Beth S. Brainard in an interview with The Crimson, adding that by outsourcing course reserve preparation duties to Lamont and restricting circulation, Fung would be able to reduce expenditures but maintain core services. "[The collections] are not circulating because there is a cost associated with circulation that we cannot afford to support any longer, but the collections are still there." Harvard College Library, a division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that administers Widener, Lamont, and Cabot Science Libraries among others, recently eliminated over 20 staff positions as part of the University-wide layoffs. HCL had implemented a variety of cost-cutting measures earlier this year as well, eliminating duplicate print subscriptions for digitally available content, centralizing technical services, and streamlining staff duties. Nevertheless, Brainard said that HCL is "spread very thinly right now" in terms of its budget—although she could not provide specific figures—and that administrators must "figure out how to support all the things we support at the College library with less money."William C. Kirby, former dean of FAS and now director of the Fairbank Center, wrote in an e-mailed statement that while the changes in circulation at Fung are of lesser importance, "much more worrisome is the diminution of [HCL's] services, capacity, and commitment" to the Fung Library's distinctive collections. And Wilt L. Idema, chair of the department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations, expressed concerns about the effect of budget pressures on HCL's ability to provide services, support research, purchase increasingly expensive academic materials, and expand and maintain collections. "A library is not a dead thing," Idema said. "A library has to continuously grow. If it does not have last five years of scholarship, what do you have? You have a museum." But Brainard said that "HCL cares very much about the needs of faculty and students across all disciplines, including Fung," and that administrators were "working as hard as possible to support all the libraries to stretch our resources, our collections, and our services to meet the whole range of academic needs." The Fine Arts Library (FAL) has also moved to a new location—the Sackler Museum lower level is housing the Digital Images and Slides Collection, while a space in the Littauer building is housing the library's printed collections, administration, and reference and research services. Brainard said that these changes were not budget-related but rather the result of renovations taking place at the Harvard Art Museum, where the Library had previously been located. She said HCL did take the opportunity to examine the Fine Arts collections during the move, and while the size of the collections is unaffected, the location of some materials—whether on campus or in the Harvard Depository—may have changed. Brainard called FAL's relocation a "temporary" move, but said that it would likely remain in Littauer for the next eight to ten years. She said that she did yet know where FAL would be moved afterwards, but that it is unlikely it will return to the Harvard Art Museum.HCL also announced earlier this week that the main entrance to the Pusey Library would be closed at the end of July, and that patrons could access the Harvard University Archives, the Harvard Map Collection, and the Harvard Theatre Collection staff offices via Lamont Library's main entrance instead. The announcement said that closing Pusey's door would help avoid security, custodial, and utility expenditures that could be redirected to other library programs and services instead. —Staff writer Peter F.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Months after launching a Web site billed as a tool for budget cutting transparency, Harvard's largest school quietly inserted three minor cuts to summer services at student-focused offices for sexual assault, study aid, and alcohol and drug prevention.
The Bureau of Study Counsel (BSC) is operating on a reduced schedule for much of the summer, with the office open Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., from July 6 to Aug. 21. The Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services (OAODS) will be closed the week of Aug. 10, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (OSAPR) will be closed for the month of July. All of the changes were made to help maximize services during the academic year, when most students are on campus, according to the statements on the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Planning Web site. 
OSAPR, OAODS, and the BSC are units within University Health Services' Department of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling, which also includes the Center for Wellness and Mental Health Services. UHS Director David S. Rosenthal '59 said that there have been no changes made to the hours or summer services at those two other offices.
Even though a couple of the changes are effective in July, the Web site was not updated with the relevant information until July 14. The changes were not accompanied by any notice that the Web site had been updated.
FAS spokesman Steve Bradt said that the administration did not issue any broad community-wide communications or e-mailed announcements in this instance because "the three changes posted this week are unlikely to impact most members of our community." He said it was important to note that "we need to balance our obligation to notify the community of reductions in services against the risk that our notifications may be ignored if too frequent."
Bradt said that students, faculty, and staff have "repeatedly requested judicious use of broadcast e-mail" and that the administration is attempting to accommodate those wishes. But he said that FAS will be updating the planning site to have alphabetical or chronological sorting capabilities for easier accessibility. 
Ryan Travia, director of OAODS, said that he could not share information on how much money is being saved through the hours reductions. But he said student traffic is certainly "considerably lower" during the summer months than during the academic year, and that he did not expect the week-long furlough for the office to cause any disruptions for students or internal operations. He said that during the slow summer months, his office typically reviews research and data collected over the course of the year, writes reports, reviews policy and procedures, and prepares for the incoming freshmen. 
If students are in need of services or counseling while OAODS is closed in August, there are resources and personnel that can assist them at the Bureau of Study Counsel or Mental Health Services, Travia said. The FAS Web site noted that calls to OSAPR in July are being forwarded directly to the Boston Rape Crisis Center. 
Travia said that administrators are still considering possible changes for the academic year.
