After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Die Antwoord released a music video to “Enter the Ninja” in 2009, they went viral and garnered a reputation as an outrageous performance art group, satirical collective, and embodiment of zef, a South African counter-culture movement described by vocalist Ninja as “the underbelly of the Afrikaans culture.” Met with distaste, adoration, and confusion, the South African rap-rave group is a cheeky tour de force—and this in-your-face, caustic spirit continues in “Donker Mag” (which means “dark power” in Afrikaans) with mixed results.
Die Antwoord’s latest album is replete with Yolandi Visser’s helium-voiced singing, Ninja’s intrepid raps, DJ Hi-Tek’s energetic beats, an ingenious mix of English and Afrikaans, and tongue-in-cheek humor. Most distinct, however, are the displays of audacity in many of its songs, including “Raging Zef Boner.” Not only does the song title allude to the group’s bold championing of zef, but the song also parodies Lady Gaga’s “Born This Way.” In the chorus, Ninja declares “It’s not my fault / I was born this way” to an electronic beat eerily reminiscent of Gaga’s hit anthem. The jab is even more daring considering the band’s shaky past with Gaga that erupted into a brief Twitter battle.
This abrasive attitude is evident from the album’s beginning. “Donker Mag” opens with “Don’t Fuk Me,” a 28-second track in which Ninja calls Tony Ciulla, Die Antwoord’s manager, and warns him to never “try to fuck” Ninja. The Mafia-esque delivery sets a defiant tone for many of the later songs. On “Happy Go Sucky Fucky,” the band shows pride for their actions and criticizes any naysayers. Yolandi espouses bold sentiments like “We live the life we love / We love the life we live” and “Fuck your rules / Who are you to tell me?” and dexterously adds fire to her words by emphasizing certain parts with rage-filled gusto and a raised voice. Her high-pitched, girlish vocals also add a haunting effect to “Do Not Fuk Wif Da Kid,” a brief interlude in which Yolandi issues threats to disparagers in a tone fit for a horror film. These three tracks—similar in idea but different in mode of expression—represent what makes Die Antwoord both attractive and deterring to listeners. The duo are direct and unflinching in their statements and are willing to embody and experiment with different personae, even within a single album.
“Donker Mag” further displays Die Antwoord’s capabilities by showcasing a wide range of styles from the glossy, almost mainstream “Ugly Boy” to more uniquely orchestrated songs like “Strunk.” Following spirited, up-tempo tracks like “Girl I Want 2 Eat U” and “Pitbull Terrier,” “Strunk” distinguishes itself from the beginning as Yolandi chatters about love while a guitar provides the melody. The acoustic feel and the two vocalists’ softened singing contribute to the song’s morose mode, reinforced by lines like “I’m so strunk, fucked up, love drunk.” The lyrics might not be poetry, but compared to “Black cats / White cats / All my zef cats” of “Pitbull Terrier,” they serve as a reflective digression. “Donker Mag” also contains weighty words: “Please give me something to believe in / I’m either driven or crippled by these demons,” Ninja laments in the album’s titular song.
These songs, rare in the Die Antwoord landscape, represent a divergence from the group’s typically crass genre and introduce a certain maturity and awareness. They are commendable, but juxtaposed against the more common sex-focused, ostentatious, biting music that defines the band, they feel jarring. The mix of brazenness and sensitivity ends up leaving the listener wondering about the potential wasted behind an act that, while entertaining and appealing in itself, lacks any significant evolution beyond becoming more grotesque and shocking. And this is where Die Antwoord’s head-on embrace of its powerful, distinct character fails for “Donker Mag.” Despite the flashy packaging, the album never truly amazes. It is audacious, yes. It is energetic, yes. It is cleanly produced and creative and representative of everything Die Antwoord has proven to be. But it lacks any semblance of growth except for a few smidgens of thought that only serve to underscore the deficiency. Instead of feeling lively and saucy, everything ends up coming out well-executed but overblown.
“Donker Mag” is playful, shameless, and grandiose with a burst of careful meditation from time to time. It is a continuing tribute to the musical trio’s brash, eccentric, and somewhat sordid character. It will not deter fans from admiring the group, but it also won’t stop critics from seeing the group as a producer of one-dimensional music. Then again, if “Happy Go Sucky Fucky” is any indication, Die Antwoord likely doesn’t care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A snarling lion graces the cover of the fifth full-length release from Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent. Juxtapose this with the covers of 50’s first two—and decidedly most acclaimed—albums, nearly identical shots of the rapper, expressionless with exposed ripped torso, and a narrative arc emerges. The art that graces 50’s albums perfectly reflects his unfortunate musical progression from iconoclastic swagger to desperate stylistic amalgamation. The latter three are increasingly plagued by high-concept beats and half-baked emotional journeys. “Animal Ambition,” which alternates wildly between well-executed rehashes of 50’s old sound and scattered attempts at a new sound, is another inconsistent entry in the artist’s increasingly frustrating recording career.
On his earlier releases, 50 Cent’s initial lyrical and personal appeal was his effortlessness: When he was showcasing his game (“In da Club”), the flirtation rolled off his tongue with nary a change in tone. When he was talking about his violent past (“Ski Mask Way”) he sounded matter-of-fact and never especially regretful or haunted. The aural landscapes that accompanied his laid-back missives were equally minimalist and charming—powerful Dr. Dre or Dre-esque beats that were heavy on synth and low on subtlety. The most entertaining tracks on “Animal Ambition” are those that follow this formula and sound like the 50 Cent of ten years ago. “Smoke” is a fun sex-and-marijuana anthem in the vein of 2003’s “High All the Time.” Dre, unsurprisingly, produces the smooth and low-tempo beat, while Trey Songz offers a catchy hook decidedly low on vocal gymnastics. The track could have easily been bumping in Tower Records as legions of pre-teens clad in G-Unit merchandise lined up to buy “Get Rich or Die Tryin’.”
The other two standouts on the album, opening track “Hold On” and “Pilot,” are just as much of a throwback. The former contains some of the most openly aggressive lines the rapper has dropped in a long time. 50 openly calls out G-Unit enemy Jimmy Henchman, who was recently convicted to life in prison, and spits rhymes like “Strap under my pillow, I done went legit / I’m not supposed to do this shit, but I forget.” While the rest of the album eschews specificity for more general visions of 50’s alternating happiness with his glamour and incessant violent tendencies, “Hold On” comes out of the gate with concrete examples and stinging delivery. “Pilot” showcases the gruff melodicism and playful sexiness that made “21 Questions” so iconic. The hook, a glitzy, G5-obsessed affair that ends with a descending scale of “oh no, no-no, no-no,” shows 50 in good voice and as effective with dronish ditties as ever, while the verses chug along with a sustained venom and efficiency.
Unfortunately, 50’s attempts to incorporate elements of the contemporary rap scene into his work are incorrigible. This isn’t a new problem—2007’s Timbaland-produced, obsessively futuristic “Ayo Technology” was an early indicator of 50 Cent’s limited adaptability to musical trends. Here, the title track is perhaps the worst offender. An EDM-laced beat complete with lion growls and hyena howls finds 50 hardly able to stay within the rhyme scheme. “Twisted,” a triumphant rap-song that sounds like a loose imitation of a Drake track, includes a laughably derivative hook from the one-hit-wonder “Waves” singer Mr. Probz. The second-half of the album is consistently difficult and is capped by “Chase the Paper,” a lame attempt at a cipher with middling guests Prodigy, Kidd Kidd, and Styles P.
The fact that 50 Cent fails on the tracks that integrate the styles of the moment is not an excuse for him to release an entire album of 2003 material. The entertaining tracks on “Animal Ambition” only work because they are diamonds in the rough. Their lack of substantial cultural commentary or musical innovation makes them hopelessly passé in a full-album format. 50 Cent, who isn’t particularly good at integrating other artists’ ideas, needs to come up with his own transformation or risk irrelevance. Jay-Z’s struggle is similar. Both rappers gained recognition through their arrogance, tales of crime, and their newfound wealth. The two have struggled, however, as the wild successes of their businesses have undone the tenability of their initial personae. Jay-Z has responded artistically through misguided attempts at pop-culture criticism, while 50 Cent has stuck to attempts at musical progression. Perhaps 50, who barely mentions anything inherently 2014 on “Animal Ambition,” could bring the necessary irony to an album more focused on analyzing the present instead of the self. In any case, 50 Cent is yet to prove he can effectively expand upon the sound that made him famous.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a losing 2013-2014 campaign with one of the youngest college squads in the country, members of the Harvard men's hockey team have viewed next season as an opportunity to benefit from more experienced leadership on the ice. The Crimson can now look forward to more experience behind the bench, as well.
Former Holy Cross head coach Paul Pearl will join Harvard as an associate head coach at the start of the 2014-2015 season. He will work alongside head coach Ted Donato '91 and assistant coach Rob Rassey.
"I think it's an exciting hire for us," Donato said. "Paul brings a wealth of experience. He's done a great job off and on the ice of developing guys, and I think he'll be a great addition to our staff. He'll give us some heft in all the areas."
After days of rumors, Harvard announced Pearl's hiring on Thursday. Pearl leaves a 297-293-69 record through 19 seasons with Holy Cross and is the winningest coach in the program's history.
"He's obviously a respected coach," junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. "He had a great career at Holy Cross.... I think he'll get along great with our coaches, and it's a big pick up for us."
Pearl will replace departing assistant coach Albie O'Connell, who has taken another assistant post at his alma mater, Boston University, after three seasons with Harvard.
"It's tough to lose a guy like Albie O'Connell," Criscuolo said. "He's been around the game forever. He was a great coach for us, and it's tough to lose him, especially to BU."
According to Donato, the new title of associate head coach intends to recognize Pearl's experience, track record, and success as a head coach. Pearl has served as a head coach in more than twice as many NCAA games as Donato, who is 136-156-39 through 10 seasons with the Crimson.
Pearl graduated from Holy Cross in 1989. The Winthrop, Mass. native skated in 125 games and scored 77 career points as a defenseman for the Crusaders.
As a head coach, Pearl served two separate stints for the Crusaders. After his first two seasons behind the bench in Worcester, Pearl moved to Providence for the 1996-1997 season to serve as the assistant coach of the Brown men's hockey team and the head coach of the Brown men's golf team.
Returning to Holy Cross for the 1997-98 season, Pearl coached the Crusaders in 2003-2004 and 2005-2006 to the program's only two conference championships and NCAA tournament appearances.
In the first round of the 2006 national tournament, 15th-seeded Holy Cross upset No. 2 Minnesota. The 4-3 overtime win by Pearl's squad marked the first-ever tournament victory by a 15th of 16th seed since the NCAA had expanded the championship field to 16 teams in 2003.
"That game really sent shockwaves across the college hockey landscape," Donato said. "It was quite remarkable and quite an accomplishment."
Pearl has coached nine more seasons and won 130 more games than the next longest-tenured Holy Cross coach. After directing the Crusaders to its first consecutive 20-win seasons in 2011-12 and 2012-13, Pearl oversaw Holy Cross's first losing record in four years with a 14-22-3 finish in 2013-14.
Holy Cross announced Pearl's resignation on May 16—two weeks before Harvard announced Pearl's hiring.
"I am saddened to see coach Pearl go, as he has been a big part of this great institution both as a student-athlete and a coach," said Holy Cross director of athletics Nathan Pine in a press release. "But we support Paul and his family in this decision and wish him continued success."
Donato described Pearl's move to Harvard as a "life-based decision." Pearl lives close to Cambridge and faced long commutes to Worcester.
At Harvard, Pearl will offer the broad expertise of a head coach yet will likely focus on special teams and defense. He will be tasked with restoring the Crimson's power play to national prominence and increasing offensive production from the team's blue line, which combined for a league-low four goals during the 2013-2014 season.
Criscuolo feels that Pearl will offer an immediate "respect factor" when the team resumes formal practices in September.
"Coach Donato has been doing a lot behind the scenes to make sure we're all ready," Criscuolo said. "I think that adding another guy who's known for winning and done a great job coaching will help [Donato] and help us improve individually and as a team."
