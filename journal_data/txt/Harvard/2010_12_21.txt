After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most of Harvard’s student body has already left the bitter winter cold of Cambridge and (hopefully) headed someplace warmer.
But for a few Crimson teams, athletes have to stick around for games in the final 10 days of the year. Men’s and women’s basketball and wrestling all have contests before the start of 2011.
For the basketball teams, the contests are hardly the easy games the team might hope for over winter recess. The men will face undefeated No. 4 UConn tomorrow, easily its toughest (and highest-ranked) opponent of the season. The Huskies have won each of their last five games by more than 10 points.
In the waning days of 2010, men’s basketball will face Monmouth on Dec. 29 and MIT on New Year’s Eve day at Lavietes Pavilion.
The women, after their game against Sacred Heart tomorrow, will play Dayton on the road on Dec. 30. The 7-5 Flyers have played a number of big-conference opponents this season and are 3-2 at home. The visit to Ohio will be the last game of the year for Harvard, which is 2-3 in away games so far this season.
Wrestling—winless so far this year—will also visit the Midwest before the end of the year, competing at The Midlands in Evanston, Ill. in the team’s third tournament of the season. The Northwestern-hosted tournament, now in its 48th incarnation, is a chance for the Crimson to turn its season around before the end of 2010.
In tournament play earlier this year, after two blowout losses to Penn State and Michigan State, the team kept the contest close against Eastern Michigan, ultimately losing, 24-22.
Last year, Harvard took 24th in the tournament. In 2008, the Crimson finished in 21st.
After winter break, activity picks up for a number of other teams. But only these three Harvard squads have the chance to compete while some radio stations are still only playing Christmas music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week, The Full-Court Press hits the rink to catch up with Eric Kroshus, a junior forward on the men’s ice hockey team. Even though the squad isn’t having its best season, Kroshus is among its leading scorers. One interesting thing to know about Canadian native—other than the way he pronounces certain words—is the type of music he enjoys before matches. Learn more about what interesting ideas Eric would have for a date with an Olympic gold-medalist, a popular choice among Harvard male athletes. Finally, which team’s goalie might have some competition for his spot next year? You’ll have to read on to find out.
Name: Eric Kroshus
Year: 2012
Stats: Kroshus is the team's second leading scorer with three goals on the yearto go along with two assists, collected in nine games so far this season.
Now, to the questions!
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Pasta and chicken, and then a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at the rink closer to game time.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
"Put You on the Game"- The Game
"Where My Dogs At?" - DMX
"We R Who We R"- Ke$ha
"Right Now" - Van Halen
"Welcome to Atlanta" (and the remix) - Jermaine Dupri and Ludacris
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
Cornell, because it has the best fans and student support. They throw stuff at us, which makes it fun.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
Before video, our coaches left their computer open, so we switched his background to a picture of our head coach when he was on “The Price is Right.”  Instead of showing once, it flashed quickly like a subliminal message every time he switched video clips. Luckily, he figured out what it was at the end, and everyone laughed about it.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the ice.
When I was six, I was putting on my hockey equipment for the first time with the help of my sister and mother. I was crying the whole time, and my mom had to phone a friend to figure out how to put on the equipment. I remember them being very immature about the can and jock strap.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
I thought a hawk, but my mom said, “No, that’s the king of birds,” and went on to say I played like a star-nosed mole.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a match.
“Put him in a casket,” after one of the other team’s players was down on the ice injured.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Soccer goalie. I loved playing goal in any sport growing up, especially soccer.  If it were a varsity sport, Omnikin ball for sure.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
Chaser, as it’s pretty similar to forward in hockey.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
Nastia Liukin, and I would take her onto the show "Shaq Vs." She and I would be competing against Shaq in a game of Omnikin ball, and then Shaq and Pinball Clemons would join us at dinner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Harvard’s 79-73 loss to Connecticut last year, Jeremy Lin ’10 had a career night, scoring 30 points, grabbing nine rebounds and handing out three assists.  Lin’s performance against the perennial powerhouse Huskies put him on the radar for NBA scouts, which led him to eventually land a roster spot on the Golden State Warriors.  Lin isn’t the only athlete from the class of 2010 to go pro, though.
Andre Akpan ’10, former men’s soccer co-captain and Harvard’s all-time leading scorer, recently finished up his first season with the MLS’s Colorado Rapids, culminating in an MLS Cup championship for Colorado.  Akpan appeared in only one game for the Rapids during the 2010 campaign, logging 13 minutes against Chivas USA and registering one shot on goal.  The Rapids’ veteran forward duo of Connor Casey and Omar Cummings limited Akpan’s playing time, but he was still able to gain valuable experience playing in five games while on loan to the FC Tampa Bay Rowdies and one at Real Maryland.  The 2009 Ivy Player of the Year also played in two matches for Colorado in U.S. Open Cup qualifying.
Akpan’s teammate, Kwaku Nyamekye ’10, was also selected in the fourth round of the 2010 MLS Super Draft by the Columbus Crew, but was not signed after failing to pass a medical examination.  The first-team All-Ivy defender trained with Columbus after graduating in May, and went on trial with the Scottish club Rangers during last year’s J-term.  Nyamekye will likely sign with Columbus for the 2011 season, as the club still retains his rights from the 2010 draft.
Colin West ’10, the 2010 College Squash Association Individual National Champion, joined the professional squash ranks and has risen to a career-high world ranking at No. 325.  West reached the quarterfinals of the White Oaks Cup, a Professional Squash Association tour event, where he fell to world No. 63 and Canadian countryman Shawn Delierre, 3-1.  West also defeated No. 124 Dane Sharp in the first round of the event.

Itty-bitty ballerina? Not during her Harvard years.
In an interview with Vogue, Natalie Portman '03 revealed both the struggles of her college experience and the grueling training she endured while preparing for her role in the recently released movie "Black Swan."
Portman said in the interview that she did gain her "freshman fifteen or 20" and battle "superdepressed moments" during the chilly Cambridge winters. Portman said she turned to Jorie Graham as a mentor, a Harvard poetry professor whom she described as “sexy and smart.”
In the past year, the Academy Award-nominated actress has undergone a radically different bodily transformation in order to play an anorexic ballerina in "Black Swan." She dropped 20 pounds through brutal five- to eight-hour days of dance training—including a mile per day of swimming. Vogue reported that during filming, Portman slept five hours per night and subsisted on coffee and ibuprofen.
Portman was careful to contrast her character with her personal life. "I'd never get to the point where I would starve or injure myself like Nina does," she told Vogue. "I'm the opposite—when I'm hungry, I eat, and I always make sure I'm eating something delicious."
With filming complete, Portman said she is focused on being her "fullest self"—even if it means owning up to those old college pounds.

In the midst of final exams and culminating projects last week, George Zisiadis ’11 saw a problem—finishing an exam or a final paper was surprisingly anticlimactic.
“There’s no way to celebrate your accomplishment,” said Zisiadis, a sociology concentrator who lives in Adams House. “You just go and work on your next exam or paper. Why should we accept the status quo of misery? Why shouldn't each exam be a cause for celebration?”
So Zisiadis installed a unique new contraption in Adams dining hall: the Adams Examer Slammer.
Resembling a three-dimensional version of the thermometer diagrams often used to chart fundraisers’ progress, the 8-foot chicken wire tube sat beside the checker's desk for the past week, waiting for Adams residents to fill it with crumpled yellow paper balls.
To use the Examer Slammer, just follow the posted instructions:
1) Take the quill and inscribe the name of the course on the yellow paper.
 
 2) Write a heartfelt message to your course and sign it with your name.
 
 3) CRUMPLE IT UP!
 
 4) Climb to the top of the Adams House Chair of Cheer, and...
 
 5) SLAM! it in as a sign of your triumph over adversity and your success in completing your course.
 
“Adams House alone will conquer at least 1000 exams,” Zisiadis said, adding that the Examer Slammer allows students to view the House's collective success.
Over the course of exam period, the tube has been filled to the top. Zisiadis says he hopes to do something similar, but on an even larger scale, in the spring.
But first, Zisiadis says, he has to figure out what to do with all the crumbled yellow paper balls.

We've waited all semester, and it has finally come—the first actual snow of the season. If you're lucky enough to still be on campus, go outside and make a snowman. Or some furniture. Have a safe trip home.
