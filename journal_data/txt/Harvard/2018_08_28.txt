After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students who receive financial aid opened an email Sunday evening asking them to check their term bills — and discovered they suddenly appeared to owe Harvard full tuition.
College administrators had sent a message to some students asking them to review their account balances over the weekend. But when undergraduates clicked through the email to Harvard’s online portal, their expected financial aid and outside scholarship credits had disappeared from the site.
Some students on financial aid saw charges posted to their accounts as high as the total cost of attendance for the fall semester.
The Student Accounts Office has since corrected the mistake by updating the website and adding back in the credits, according to Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane. All affected students should now see corrected balances on their accounts, she said.
Dane wrote in an email that the error occurred when Harvard’s Financial Aid Office provided an “anticipated aid” file to the Student Accounts Office. The move “inadvertently” caused the disappearance of financial aid packages and outside awards like the National Merit Scholarship, Dane wrote.
“This was not a data security issue and no student account information was compromised,” Dane wrote. “This was an unfortunate error and we apologize for any confusion or concern this caused our students.”
Before Harvard fixed the problem, several concerned students and parents reached out to flag the issue to College administrators.
Financial Aid Officer Justin Munio replied and assured recipients that the snafu would not impact students’ aid.
“It does not affect students’ ability to check in or move in, so that can proceed as normal,” Munio wrote in the email. “Nor does it change the amount of grant/loan aid that was being applied.”
Around 70 percent of College students are recipients of some form of financial aid, according to the Financial Aid Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lawyers for Harvard again argued in a Monday filing that a trial in the approaching admissions lawsuit against the University is not necessary because, they say, the evidence obviously points in their favor.
“Harvard’s admissions practices are entirely consistent with the law and necessary to build the diverse community critical to the success of its students,” the filing reads.
This latest document doubles down on Harvard’s arguments from its June 15 motion for summary judgment — that is, a decision without a trial. The plaintiff in the suit, the anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, also filed its own motion for summary judgment and argued that indisputable facts support its allegations.
SFFA, led by conservative litigant Edward Blum, brought the lawsuit against Harvard in Nov. 2014, alleging the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Harvard has repeatedly denied those charges.
Much of Harvard’s argument Monday rested on the claim that SFFA doesn’t have legal standing to sue the University. The filing asserts the group is a “ litigation vehicle” that has “never been a proper plaintiff.”
Harvard lawyers argued the organization is not a “genuine membership organization” and that none of its individual members have standing to sue the University. It says most members of SFFA are not eligible transfer students, and therefore could not have faced any “redressable injury.”
SFFA calls itself “a nonprofit membership group of more than 20,000 students, parents, and others” in opposition to affirmative action. According to its website, members pay a one-time fee of $10 upon joining and their identities are confidential.
The identities of the students who have testified or provided material as part of the lawsuit are also private.
In the Monday filing, Harvard summarizes evidence ranging from economic analysis to administrators’ depositions in order to reiterate two key points from its original motion for summary judgement: that Harvard neither discriminates against Asian American applicants nor engages in racial balancing of its incoming classes. It contends the College considers race in accordance with Supreme Court precedent and could not accomplish its educational mission without doing so.
SFFA's president Blum wrote in an email that the organization plans to address the school's arguments in an upcoming court submission of its own.
Monday’s filing is the latest development in the summary judgment phase of the lawsuit, which began in June. Hundreds of internal Harvard documents became public as part of that process, revealing scores of tidbits about the College's secretive admissions process including that legacy students have a much higher chance of acceptance and that an internal Harvard review once concluded the school's admissions process produces "negative effects" for Asian Americans.
Experts have said the case will almost certainly go to trial. The outcome of that trial could have significant consequences for the future of affirmative action policies at colleges and universities across the country.
The trial is set to begin on Oct. 15 at the U.S. District Court in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics announced its roster of Fall 2018 residential fellows Monday and launched a new program on local politics led by three former mayors.
Former Democratic National Committee CEO and former EMILY’s List executive director Amy Dacey, former Nevada congressman Joseph J. Heck, and Bloomberg News’ Senior White House Correspondent Margaret Talev will join the IOP as fellows this semester, as well as John Noonan, national security advisor to the presidential campaigns of Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, and Brittany Packnett, vice-president of national community alliances and engagement at Teach for America.
In a press release, the IOP also introduced an “innovative new study group” involving former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter, and former Los  Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The mayors will make “regular visits” to campus and focus on topics concerning “mayoral leadership” and “local government.”
These fellows will join Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz, the IOP’s first-ever “Senior Fellow.” 
IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said the new additions will allow Harvard students to have “unique opportunities and access” to the fellows “for conversations on the important issues of our time.”
“Our new class of Fellows joins a rich legacy at the IOP of blending the practitioners of politics with the academy,” Gearan said in the press release. “This year we are also very pleased to have the additional engagement of three outstanding public servants who have led cities in times of immense change who also will be leading a weekly study group.”
Noonan, who is planning to host a national security-focused study group, wrote in an email that his parents were “shocked” that Harvard was letting him “within 500 miles of campus.”
“Aside from the simple fact that it's as prestigious a fellowship as a lousy old political hack and former nuclear weapons guy like me can do, this is all about the students,” Noonan wrote. “We've been blessed to live in a relatively peaceful world for the past 70 years. I want students to learn that it's damn hard work to keep that peace, and encourage them to step up in their careers and forge a new peace that lasts another 70 years.”
Talev — who has covered President Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama — wrote in an email that the fellowship presents a good opportunity to “take stock of her experiences” and share them with others.
“I'm lucky to have had a front-row seat for some of the biggest political events of the last decade,” Talev wrote. “I want to take students behind the scenes and connect them to some of the most interesting people I've met who've been part of those developments.”
But no issue seems as important as the upcoming midterm elections, multiple fellows said, and many said they are already planning discussions about the elections.
Dacey, who is focusing her seminar on women in politics, said the midterms will open the door to many conversations about “what’s at stake” and what trends “mean for politics in general.”
“I do think this midterm election is an incredible time to have that conversation about women in politics and the dynamics of what's going to happen this cycle, what is going to happen in the future, so we're going to use that to look at various different topics and look at it in different ways,” Dacey said.
This class of fellows is the first to come to Cambridge after a new set of standards for fellows took effect, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in a previous interview.
The IOP restructured its fellow system after public outcry over its decision to revoke the fellowship of Chelsea Manning — a former Army soldier who went to prison for leaking classified military documents to WikiLeaks — and grant fellowships to former Trump staffers Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer in the last academic year. Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email in Oct. 2017 that the School was “working to better understand our current practices for applying the term 'Fellow', and to establish consistent standards across the School.”
The Kennedy School has also faced criticism from students and alumni in recent months for the lack of racial and gender diversity of its professors, fellows, and guest speakers. Many of the members of the fall class of IOP fellows, however, said they believe this class of fellows reflects many different backgrounds and political beliefs.
“It's a great group of fellows with diverse backgrounds, views, interests and ambitions,” Talev said. “I can't wait to get up there.”
