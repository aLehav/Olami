After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before an audience of about 30 Harvard students and affiliates crowded in the intimate setting of the Harvard College Women’s Center, history professor Niall Ferguson offered another apology Monday afternoon for his recent controversial comments about economist John Maynard Keynes’s sexuality.
“I screwed up, quite badly,” opened Ferguson, echoing a May 4 blog post on his personal website and his open letter published in The Crimson last week. “Let me reiterate the apology that I made in print...I’m tremendously sorry.”
Speaking to a crowd of investors at a conference in California two weeks ago, Ferguson was asked to comment on Keynes’s famous remark, “In the long run we are all dead.” Ferguson responded by implying that Keynes did not care about intergenerational equity because he was gay and childless.
On Monday, Ferguson continued his effort to distance himself from those remarks.
“My main purpose in inviting you to come to this dialogue is to establish that I have no prejudice against childless people and certainly not gay people,” Ferguson said. “What I said was stupid and not malicious.”
Ferguson, who is also a senior research fellow at Oxford University and had flown over from England Sunday night for the event, had reached out to Harvard College Queer Student and Allies co-chairs Ivel Posada ’14 and Roland Yang ’14 and Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life Vanidy “Van” Bailey to organize an open discussion with the Harvard community.
“I thought it was a really good discussion,” Posada said. “I think people were very honest with how they felt, and I appreciate how conducive the [Women’s Center] was to that.”
After his opening apology, Ferguson spent the rest of the lunch discussion, titled “Sexuality and History: A Dialogue with Niall Ferguson,” answering attendees’ questions.
“This is an opportunity for dialogue, not debate,” said Assistant Dean of Student Life Emelyn A. dela Peña, who moderated the event.
When asked about his own experience as a father, Ferguson said he did not think it affected his views much in regards to the issue at hand.
“I think I’d think in exactly the same way about the broader issues of intergenerational equity, whether or not I had children,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson made it clear that as a historian, he found it “baffling” that some have suggested that gender is not relevant to understanding Keynes.
“As a biographer, I’m interested in sexuality like I’m interested in every aspect of the subject’s life,” Ferguson said.
Still, he reiterated, “I don’t at all somehow believe that there is a ‘gay economics’ and that Keynes was a part of it.”
Many of the attendees said they were pleased with Ferguson’s willingness to have an open discussion about the controversy, saying that the event sparked a serious discussion about the role of identity.
“I thought it was great how he focused the issue on how identity can play a role in history,” said Harry W. Hild ’16. “I am willing to take his word that his true feelings were expressed today.... I think he’s doing the right thing with trying to increase that awareness [about identity].”
Louis Cid ’14 echoed Hild’s sentiment, saying, “Professor Ferguson did a fantastic job of explaining his position and going into the nuances of how a historian thinks about questions of identity.”
Nonetheless, some members of the audience were left with lingering questions about the controversy.
“What do we expect in an apology?  Or is it that once you make a mistake, you’re beyond being redeemed?” Posada reflected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School will accept members of the Harvard College Class of 2015 next year in the pilot stage of a new deferred admission program for college juniors, according to the Law School’s Assistant Dean and Chief Admissions Officer Jessica L. Soban ’02.
Similar to the 2+2 Program at Harvard Business School, this new program will require admitted students to work for two years after their college graduation before entering the Law School in order to encourage work experience. The first admitted class will enter the Law School in the fall of 2017.
The new admissions process, called the Junior Deferral Pilot, will likely be open exclusively to Harvard College juniors for the first few years.
Soban said the program is intended to give students “the room to explore and be able to come back” to the Law School. During the two-year deferral period, which could be expanded on a case-by-case basis, students are encouraged to pursue a variety of job opportunities, including fellowships, Teach for America, or business.
“We’re giving people some guard rails,” said Soban, a former Crimson business editor. “It’s for people who want to have something locked down so they can focus on their job search and explore their passions.”
The program is also forward-looking, designed to help students develop “networks and work experience so that after Law School they can hit the ground running,” Soban said.
Soban said the program aims in part to attract students with a hard science background, although applicants with a wide variety of interests are encouraged to apply.
“Having a technical background as an attorney is increasingly valuable,” she said, adding that the interdisciplinary nature of the profession has established a greater need for lawyers who have experience working in other fields, particularly the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields known as STEM.
A significant portion of students at the Law School already enter the classroom with work experience. Currently, more than 75 percent of Harvard Law School students enter the class at least one year out of college, while about 50 percent enter after two, Soban said.
The program’s first applicants will face an admissions process very similar to that of normal Law School hopefuls. The application will be released in the fall around the same time as the standard JD application in September. College juniors interested in the program must submit a personal statement, scores for the LSAT, and letters of recommendation.
Unlike students who apply through the normal process, however, participants in this new program will be allowed to submit scores from the February LSAT exam and will also receive in-person interviews at the Harvard Law School campus as opposed to speaking with admissions officers via the videoconferencing software Skype.
In addition, applicants will be required to submit their transcript through the end of their junior year.
Soban added that the shifted admissions cycle allows students to complete their applications and study for the LSAT during their junior year instead of as seniors or while they have a job, a change she hopes will alleviate some of the stress of applying to Law School.
Applicants will be notified of their admissions status during the early part of the summer after their junior year. Soban said she is uncertain how many students will be admitted under the new program because the number of applicants is hard to gauge at this point, though she said the process would be “competitive.”
Brent C. Westbrook ’15, president of the Harvard College Black Pre-Law Association, said he plans to apply to Harvard Law School through the new program.
“My initial reaction to this policy is that it is good,” he said. “I think it gives you real world exposure, and you are a lot more mature going into law school. I think a lot of people don’t understand what sector of law school they want to go into right after college, and this helps them figure that out.”
Hillary Preston, a first-year student at the Law School who took three years off after college, said that she found her work experience to be valuable when she stepped back into the classroom.
“I think it puts the Law School in perspective,” she said. “Not coming straight from school, I have a more forward-looking approach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Harvard student who founds a start-up does not become the next billionaire under 30.
Instead, they are faced with a new set of obstacles, such as finding funding and developing management skills. And upon leaving, these former students must also find housing and often form an entirely new social circle.
The Chronicle of Higher Education reports a 97.4 percent six-year graduation rate from Harvard, which translates to more than 40 students per entering class not receiving a diploma in that time.
According to Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, 682 students are currently on leave from the College, including students who left as long ago as the 1970s.
Those who start a business in the middle of their time at Harvard are certainly taking the road less traveled.
A TIME FOR EVERYTHING
“In the beginning, there were a lot questions and uncertainties,” said John V. Capodilupo, a former member of the class of 2014.
In his sophomore spring, Capodilupo began wondering whether a computer science concentration was right for him.
But when an offer came to work on Bobo Analytics, Inc., a company that designs a wristband that continuously collects heart-rate data and aims to replace the classic chest strap heart monitor, Capodilupo took the summer position.
For Capodilupo, an offer from a start-up seemed like the best way to find his calling.
Anand S. Gupta, however, had already found a project he cared about several months before taking his leave and tried to balance a full course load for the semester prior to leaving.
“At the end of my sophomore year, the amount of homework I was getting done proportional to the amount of project work I was getting done, that ratio was very much skewed in one way [towards the project],” said Gupta, a former member of the class of 2014.
“If you’re going to be at Harvard... don’t screw around.” Gupta said.
Splitting his time between Cambridge and Boston, Gupta is currently developing software to aid pathologists searching through digitized images of cancer-affected tissue.
Similarly, Merrill H. Lutsky and Erik C. Schluntz, both former members of the class of 2015, found themselves without enough hours to work on a project they co-founded.
“I had to take a midterm for my psych course, and then I literally had to leave that, get in a taxi, and leave for the airport to fly out for the interview.” said Lutsky, referring to an interview with Y Combinator, a selective for-profit start-up incubator that provides start-up founders with seed money and mentorship.
Lutsky and Schluntz were accepted into the 2013 YC “winter class” for their start-up, Posmetrics. Originally inspired by their Computer Science 50 final project, Posmetrics provides a mobile application for giving real time feedback of hotels and restaurants. According to its website, the app could increase feedback rates over 100-fold compared to current survey methods.
A DAY IN THE LIFE
“Working on a start up company sort of consumes your entire life. I find myself constantly thinking about how we could be growing faster than we are,” Lutsky said. “If you can’t really sustain that high pace of innovation and progress and growth within your company all the way from day one to [initial public offer], you’re likely to be outrun by competition.”
Lutsky said founders of a start-up need to be adaptable and capable of covering all the bases while their start-up is in its initial stage before developing their team.
Coming from technical backgrounds, Lutsky and Schluntz had to reinvent themselves as “sales guys.”
“Having to train ourselves to fulfill that role was one of the more interesting personal challenges of starting a company,” Lutsky said.
“You think your college life is kind of a roller coaster. Like, ‘Oh, this week I’ve got psets, like I’ve got three psets due tomorrow and two midterms to turn in the morning after,” Gupta said, moving his finger up and down in front of his face. “For [a start-up], the roller coaster highs and lows are much bigger.”
Besides running a business, leaving Harvard means having to start a life on your own, which comes with all the difficulties that some would gloss over.
“Housing is a pain in the ass and ridiculously hard to find,” said Ben M. Yu, a former member of the Class of 2014. “I lived in a garage for a good while. A bunch of the [Thiel] fellows had this awesome ‘mansion.’... They needed someone to take a temporary lease on it until the end of April.... They had two rooms available, one of them was a garage and the other was the pool house.”
Because the pool house was 8 feet long, Yu opted for the garage, where he found new value in heated blankets.
Yu became a Thiel Fellow in 2011, leaving Harvard after his freshman fall semester. He initially planned to work on Pricemash, a tool designed to compare prices for online items fitted with the ability to consider online deals from outside providers, such as Groupon.
But when Pricemash failed, Yu started work on Sprayable Energy, a topical caffeine spray, which delivers a more even energized feeling when compared to the energy spike from caffeinated drinks. Launch has been delayed for some time because of the health requirements that Sprayable Energy has to meet.
THE “TROUGH OF SORROW”
“It’s extremely difficult to work on something by yourself,” Yu said. “Inevitably, every start-up goes through a ‘trough of sorrow’ and everything is going to shit and everything looks like it’ll never succeed.”
Yu learned from his experience at Pricemash that he was not cut-out for a management position and belonged closer to the technical side of a business. He believes his decision to manage his company was a hasty one.
“I misconstrued that as, ‘I need to work with what I have,’ rather than ‘I need to build the skills that I want to have,’” Yu said.
Lutsky remembers the difficulties he and Schluntz had getting off the ground upon moving to California.
“It was pretty much me and my co-founder running around San Francisco all day going to various hotels and businesses, getting kicked out of various hotels and businesses,” Lutsky said. “Going from sort of a Harvard lifestyle to the depths of being kicked out of hotels was an abrupt transition. There were very hectic days of not much sleep, getting phones hung up on us [while] talking to more professional clients.”
REGRETS?
“I’m trying to think of some juicy ugly stories...but I can’t think of anything. I’ve had a wonderful time so far,” said Connor N. Zwick, a former member of the class of 2015.
Zwick left Harvard after his freshman year to work on his “coco controller” after becoming a Thiel Fellow. The slide-on “coco” cell phone case features an analog stick and tactile buttons, which allow users to play games on their phones the same way they would play on hand-held consoles.
Zwick and co-founder Colton T. Gyulay, another former member of the class of 2015, put up their Kickstarter website to crowdsource funds for their company in August 2012. They took the page down after less than three days when they decided to redesign the case to accommodate the iPhone 5, and consequently raised over $26,000 in the process. They plan to relaunch sometime this year.
Like Zwick, other former students had similarly positive comments regarding their choices to take leaves of absence.
“The greater danger at the time was in not leaving, the regret we would’ve had had somebody else pursued this kind of thing and been successful in the space [while] the two of us had been sitting around in class,” Lutsky said. “Even if everything were to fall apart tomorrow, I still think I would have made the same decision.”
“I actually don’t regret it at all. And I think I would have regretted it if—well, one, if the business failed—but more importantly if we were away from Boston,” Capodilupo said. “The biggest drawback I experienced was just being away from all the relationships I’d built,...not having that daily interaction of going to a party Friday night with everybody. It’s a dramatic difference that I didn’t think was going to be as stark.”
Yu echoed similar sentiment.
“Do I regret taking my leave? No, not at all,” Yu said. “The only downside is that I’m still technically a freshman.”
IN THE SHADOW OF “THE SOCIAL NETWORK”
After the 2010 film was released and since the Thiel Fellowship has gained so much publicity, dropping out of college to make millions of dollars almost seems trendy.
Beyond putting budding entrepreneurs in the public eye, however, the “dropout fad” has also changed the tone within the start-up sphere.
“I think obviously that there’s a danger in overly romanticizing this kind of lifestyle,” Lutsky said. “The reality is that it’s very difficult work. If you come out here to work on a company...that is pretty much all me and my co-founder do.”
As college students see an increasing number of their peers leave academia to start businesses, the reality of the situation is often warped.
A March article in “The Atlantic” mentions research on Chicago Public School students, saying that students often do not apply to selective colleges because of the misconceptions they have about opportunities outside of higher education.
“I think this was not the best time to start because it’s marked with a lot of idealism, and not so much realistic, pragmatic expectations,” Yu said, reflecting on his entrance into entrepreneurship.
“DROPOUT”
“It’s not like I’m dropping out forever,” Zwick said with an emphasis on “forever.” “It’s more like I’m taking a few gap years.”
Each of the former students mentioned stated that Harvard’s policy on leaves of absence is generous. The policy allows any student to take a five-year leave once they’ve been enrolled at the college for a semester. None of them ruled out the possibility of returning completely.
“I talked to a lot of entrepreneurs from other universities in Boston where you can’t take more than a term of light course load or else you have to decide to permanently leave,” Lutsky said.
And, of course, the term “dropout” often comes with a stigma that many would choose to steer away from.
“I don’t like the word ‘dropout’ because I didn’t drop out,” Capodilupo said. “It’s got a lot of funny connotations to it. Some people are like, ‘You’re too good for school?’ and other people get angry when you say it, like, ‘Oh, how could you possibly drop out of Harvard?’”
Gupta also avoided the term ‘dropout.’
“In the grand scheme of things I will be back in academia,” he said. “Whether it’s now or 10 years from now, it will happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s been a big year for the Crimson. Men’s basketball won its first ever NCAA tournament game and a Harvard alum won a Super Bowl. Club sports and concussions stole the limelight. From historic victories to teams in transition, the Back Page brings you the ten most interesting stories of the spring and encourages you to take a break from studying to enjoy the sun and take a look back on this semester in Harvard Athletics.
Leaving it All Out on the Field
As part of a multimedia push at The Crimson, writers Martin Kessler, Maya Jonas-Silver, and Jacob Feldman took a look inside the concussion policies of the Harvard Athletic Department and the NCAA. Complete with stories of athletes who have suffered through the injury and the recovery, this story looks at one of the most pressing and current issues in sports, both at the collegiate and the professional level.
From Harvard to Harbowl
This February, Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk ’98 won a Super Bowl, ending a successful football career that took a four-year detour in Cambridge. This article, by Scott Sherman, looks back on Birk’s success with the Crimson and in Baltimore over the years.
Juszczyk Becomes First NFL Draft Pick Since Fitzpatrick '05
As Harvard’s most decorated tight end, Kyle Juszczyk was drafted 130th overall in the fourth round of the NFL Draft. Scott Sherman chronicles Juszczyk’s reaction to his selection and how he will continue Harvard’s legacy with the Baltimore Ravens.
Harvard Helps Spur the Growth of Ultimate

Fitting the entirety of your material possessions into a bunch of boxes and suitcases is no easy task. So when it comes time to do away with that saggy futon that didn't sell at your senior sale or that Ethical Reasoning coursepack you've fully accepted that you will never crack open again, the trash or recycling bin may seem like the only viable home for these items.
But finding a greener solution for discarding your unwanted things might not be as tough as you think.
The Office of Sustainability has put together a comprehensive list and accompanying map of locations around campus where students can donate unwanted furniture, clothing, textbooks, and other items. Different stations accept different types of donations, so be sure to check the listings before donating your things.
Chances are one of the stations is conveniently located near your dorm. So think twice before hitting up the dumpster. One man's zebra print rug is another man's treasure!
