After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mothers’ debut album, “When You Walk A Long Distance You Are Tired,” is a welcome assurance that rock music these days has a lot of heart. Hailing from Athens, Georgia, Mothers is a folk-rock quartet, composed of frontwoman Kristine Leschper and her bandmates Matthew Anderegg, Drew Kirby, and Patrick Morales. In keeping with their local DIY alt scene that brought artists like R.E.M. and Neutral Milk Hotel to the mainstream, Mothers offers a folk-rock sensibility centered around a quietly urgent lyrical landscape.
Leschper’s vocals immediately draw comparison to those of her female contemporaries. There’s a bit of Angel Olsen’s rawness or Sharon Van Etten’s fragile introspection. Her voice strains and bend with a genuine, not affected, intensity that reinforces lyrical content. On “It Hurts Until It Doesn’t”—a standout track released last year as a single—Leschper invokes Olsen as she sing-yells at the upper end of her register, her voice pushing to create force. In two lines that begin with “I felt” swoop in, Leschper sounds like an off-kilter bird with a broken wing. Yet her wavering intensity never reaches desperation; it’s more an assertion that what she’s voicing is required, the product of a necessary feeling.
For the most part, bandmates Anderegg, Kirby, and Morales complement Leschper throughout the album: They often create moments of beauty by backing off slightly and giving her the space to let painful lyrics land. In the final minutes of the previously mentioned “It Hurts..,” for example, a light quickening of snare drums carries the track into the bridge. Moments later the instrumentation slows down, a hint of reverb creeping in as Leschper quiets and murmurs slightly to set up the mundane honesty of the line “I don’t like myself when I’m awake.”
Unfortunately, the four don’t always sound in sync. The track, “Nesting Behavior,” gestures towards an ethereal deftness but ultimately disappoints. Leschper’s vocal movements, on this song, sound a touch too whiny and operatic. The other sonic elements of the track doesn’t provide relief either, as sweeping violins irritate rather than soothe. The track doesn't succeed—but it also doesn’t detract from the sophistication of Mothers’ sound.
The deliberate use of guitar, drums, and bass throughout the album creates melding harmonies and repeated riffs that give songs an immediate, visceral rock edge. The track “Copper Mines,” for instance, offers palatable harmonies with a punk punch. Comparatively, on opening track “Too Small for Eyes,” the twanging of piano, ukulele, and violin lays a sturdy foundation for Leschper to play with the tone of her voice. Despite a surprisingly lovely, rustic kitschiness—that pays homage to fellow southern folk-rock artists like the Avett Brothers—this song doesn’t quite fit into the harsher, keyed-up instrumentation of later tracks. The subtle inventiveness of Mothers’ composition on other tracks, however, make up for this weaker song. For instance, on “Blood-letting,” a series of repeated chords, in tandem with string instrumentation, give greater attention to the elegance of Leschper’s quavering voice.
The lyricism on “When You Walk…” often feels like the product of keepsakes through which Leschper painstakingly sorts: Among the abandoned lint and coins are fleeting moments of profound urgency. The imagery Leschper presents to us is often reserved and unassuming: a touch on the wrist, a napkin in the rain, the coppery taste of pennies. Certain lines stun because of their precision: “God is stuck singing himself to sleep / I am not the only one” (“Blood-letting”), or “I want your ghost inside a thimble” (“Lockjaw”). In these moving lyrics, Leschper simultaneously trudges through and circumvents loss. Other lyrics evoke the hopeless meanderings of a woeful teenager—“I don’t like myself when I’m awake” (“It Hurts Until It Doesn’t”) or “I hate my body,” (“Too Small For Eyes”) for example. Yet Leschper will frequently veer towards eloquent poeticism, as in the case with the latter, slipping in striking lines like “I love your taste / bird stirring in my chest.” The juxtaposition keeps lyrical content from sounding overwrought or saccharine.
The title of Mothers’ debut album reads as a weary fact: It suggests that the road to what Mothers presents to the listener has been a long time coming. As the album eases into its ending track—the breathlessly bittersweet “Hold Your Own Hand,” which features a jazz tempo that slows and transitions into soothing patient lullaby of a riff—Leschper sings, “I think I could learn to love,” in a way that suggests that all the walking has broken her heart. The energetic stomp of drums in the final minute feels like catharsis, an urgent release and final lap towards eventual rest.

For better or worse, “Plaza,” the third and latest offering from Boston-based indie band Quilt, is an album of a particular atmosphere. Layered with ringing guitars, fluttering harmonies, and occasional orchestral flourishes, “Plaza” sees Quilt embracing psychedelic rock, a subtle shift from the somewhat simpler dreamy indie rock of their previous works. This shift is so subtle, in fact, that Quilt break little new ground and stay in their comfort zone. Within those confines, though, Quilt perform well. “Plaza” boasts interesting themes and well-written lyrics, and although not musically fascinating, it has enough melodies and instrumental ideas that it’s a pleasant and sometimes captivating listen.
The best songs on “Plaza” are mid-tempo, mixed major-minor key, heavily rhythm guitar-based, vocal harmony-adorned tunes with interesting, cryptic lyrics. Fortunately, there are plenty of these. Unfortunately, the worst songs on “Plaza” are also mid-tempo, mixed major-minor key, heavily rhythm guitar-based, vocal harmony-adorned tunes with interesting, cryptic lyrics. Variety is just not Quilt’s strong suit, and early in the album in particular, if one isn’t paying close attention, it can be hard to notice where one song begins and another ends. The rich, busy, mid-’60s sound is pretty appealing, but it makes for a long album, even at ten tracks. The album is at its lowest when at its most droning, like on “Searching For,” when Quilt waste the excellent lyrics of the verses on a flat melody.
What differentiates the good songs from the unexciting are flashes of charming inventiveness: For instance, the dancing guitar interplay and compelling lyrical conceit of “O’Connor’s Barn” and the stop-and-start chorus of the closing “Own Ways,” which begins as a generically detached psych-rock breakup song but turns into a surprisingly engaging, high-energy mantra jam. These songs—along with “Something There,” an irresistibly poppy and sentimental gem—are true highlights, but Quilt also display their strengths on several other tracks. Primary vocalist Anna Fox Rochinski renders “Hissing My Plea” instantly memorable by pronouncing the “a” in “plea” with a fabulous drawl. And although it threatens to sink under its own musical complexity, “Eliot St.,” the lead single, features a spookily wordless chorus and lyrics about alienation that stand as the album’s best.
But “Plaza” doesn’t quite have enough of these moments to be great. Too often, Quilt revel too much in their soundscapes, and a few songs, even good ones like “Hissing My Plea” and the opening “Passersby,” wear out their welcome. Perhaps because the tonal diversity is concentrated in the second half of the album with the refreshingly contemplative “Padova” and the coolly grooving “Your Island,” these problems might just stem from poor sequencing—only the aforementioned “Searching For” can reasonably be called a weak track—but for one reason or another, the whole of “Plaza” is less than the sum of its parts.
Quilt begin their tour of “Plaza” on Friday, Feb. 26, at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

Aislinn E. Brophy ’17, a theater, dance, and media concentrator, is the president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, which sponsors and organizes most of the theatrical events on campus. The Harvard Crimson had the chance to sit down with Brophy and discuss her plans as the head of Harvard’s largest student theater group, her experiences in the new TDM concentration, her ongoing theatrical work, and the current HRDC season.
The Harvard Crimson: How is your HRDC presidency going?
Aislinn E. Brophy: I think it’s a really exciting time for us, especially because our new board is very young as opposed to the old board.… Two of us are juniors and the rest are sophomores. So it is six people who are all very excited and very new and really raring to go and get things done.… Our major platform is diversity and inclusion and trying to make sure that people feel comfortable in our community, which goes into creating a stronger social scene for HRDC as well.
THC: Could you tell me about HRDC’s upcoming season?
AEB: We have our two main-stage shows, which are the “The Wonderful World of Dissocia,” which is directed by Garrett [C.] Allen [’16], and “Black Magic,” which is directed by Kimiko [M.] Matsuda-Lawrence ['16]. "Black Magic" is a partnership with BlackCAST [The Harvard Black Community and Student Theater Group].… It’s really exciting for us to expand our partnership with them for this semester, because the [Loeb] Mainstage is a huge undertaking. We were so excited when they decided to apply and we are really excited to see these kinds of things on stage.… It’s really exciting to see a Mainstage season that is that strong. I think the Ex [Loeb Experimental Theater] season is also super interesting—at the end of the semester we have “In the Next Room, or the Vibrator Play” being directed by Caro [P.] Ribeiro [’18], which is super interesting and about women.… We have “SHE” at Oberon, which is a musical being written by two students who are incredibly talented. It’s about the experience of being a woman in 2016…. I’m in “SHE,” which is also really exciting because I really enjoy personally female narratives and seeing that on stage.
THC: What do you think HRDC’s role on campus is or should be?
AEB: I think that it’s important as a student theater organization to provide a safe space for people to experiment in.… I think that’s what the role of student theater should be: people trying new things, pushing the envelope, and trying their hand at things they’ve never done before—and trying to get their friends to come and see theater in a way that they might not be able to in the future. Because theater can be expensive, but here it’s almost always free.
THC: Are you currently writing anything?
AEB: I’ve started writing two pieces. One is a longer work, which may be my thesis. The other is shorter, probably only going to be 20-25 pages, one act.… [The shorter play is] a little bit inspired by “No Exit”—it’s about these two characters and one of them is dead. It’s unclear what the situation is for a good amount of time into the play, and it becomes clearer that this is sort of this man’s version of hell, and he’s being punished by being forced to confront people in his past in his life that he had mistreated in some egregious way.
THC: What has your experience been like with the TDM concentration?
AEB: It’s a really exciting time for them and for us, because everything is new and everything is happening.… I think one of the things that’s really marking the department right now is that it is a lot of people who have been really wanting this forever and just wanting to make something that students are happy about and excited about. They are always asking for our input and asking how things are going and they want to be super open to suggestions.… It’s a great thing to be able to finally properly fold into my extracurricular experience, which in some ways for me was my academic experience, before this. Because I want to go into theater after I graduate, me doing theater extracurricularly is not really an extracurricular at all because it’s putting me on track for my future career and giving me super valuable life experience. It’s nice to be able to actually say that I’m getting academic credit for the thing that I want to be doing anyway.

The heat in that classroom in Sever was unbearable. Everyone was pulling off their layers, stripping down to their t-shirts to find some relief. It didn’t help that the room was completely full, many of us sitting mere inches apart. There weren’t enough desks in this Latin American Studies class. People had to grab chairs from empty classrooms next door, squeezing them in wherever they could find space. The situation was stuffy, cramped, but at least it meant people cared about being there.
A guest lecturer was explaining the role of bilingual Latinos in the United States, giving meaning to Spanglish outside of a mediocre 2004 comedy. I was finally learning about myself—about the duality I’ve lived for my entire life—in a validating, academic setting. Later that night, as I trudged through dense sociology readings, I stumbled across an explanation of how poor immigrants "create rotating credit associations to generate resource pools available to the group.” I highlighted it, realizing the excerpt was central to my existence. It took an academic text, read exactly 2,995 miles from home, for me to understand why my mom always reminded my dad to drop off the payment for “el cuchubal” every month. It took being at Harvard, a place that is so often difficult to call home, for me to understand the things that have made me who I am.
I’m thankful. I’m thankful for the opportunities that this institution has granted me, but that does not mean I cannot be critical of where it fails. Harvard has failed Latino populations for decades now, and it continues to fail us. It has taken rejection, mobilization, dejection, and the exhausting work of my brothers and sisters before me to get us to this point. I will be pursuing a secondary field in Latino Studies, an opportunity afforded to me by the nameless brown faces I’ll never know.
And even with that, I’m pursuing a course of study that was only created as a subset of the Ethnicity, Migration, Rights secondary field. What our community needs is an entire Latino Studies department, one that will only thrive with the diversification of Harvard’s faculty and staff. Current professors of color are overworked, thrown into numerous diversity committees, and simply cannot serve the large numbers of students seeking mentors who will invest in them.
The calls for a Latino Studies department and diversification are not matters of self-aggrandizement, but rather the solution to this systemic problem of underrepresentation. For Latino students, who often live the duality of being low-income, the first-generation of their family to attend college, or both, there are often no figures in their personal lives to lead them in pursuing jobs in academia or administration at higher education institutions. Where am I supposed to turn to fix these issues if the game is rigged to keep my melanin out? If Harvard is serious about diversifying the people who work here, as they often allege, they’ll start acting now.
Our friends in Palo Alto seem to have this figured out, so the best university in the world better solve its problem soon. Because that’s what it boils down to: a deep problem. I see it when my.harvard.edu reveals that only one non-tutorial Latin American Studies class is being offered this semester. None were offered in the fall. I see it when the demographics of the University faculty and staff are so deeply buried online that finding it took a face-to-face meeting with the president of the University and an e-mail from her Chief of Staff.
Expanding the Latino Studies curriculum is crucial, not only for Latino students to learn about themselves, but for all Harvard students to be equipped to function in an ever-changing American landscape. These are the students who will go on to be our educators, policy makers, and politicians. Not teaching them about the world they are entering would be a disservice and will lead to a misguided, or even dangerous, future.
We’re here to learn. It’s the place every family dreams of sending their child because it has, for nearly 400 years, been the leading force in education. Harvard can’t afford to fall behind now, and we won’t let it. We’ll keep writing, speaking, and shouting, in English, Spanish, or the Spanglish we know too well, until we’re heard. I’ll be using my voice until the day I can call my mom on the phone and say, “Sí Mamí, las cosas están difíciles, but they’re changing. Finalmente, things are changing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Senator Marco Rubio claimed that “welders make more money than philosophers” in a November presidential debate, implicit in his statement was the conviction that the humanities lack value and that the end goal of education is a high paying job. And it seems many American leaders agree: In recent years, public  education systems have begun shifting their focus from the humanities to STEM, neglecting disciplines rooted in the arts, ideas, and the celebration of human cultural achievement.
In Kentucky, for example, Governor Matt Bevin suggested last month that students of French literature not receive state funding for college. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory echoed the sentiment, saying higher education funding should be not be “based on butts in seats, but on how many of those butts can get jobs.”
While some of these proposals are advertised as only privileging STEM fields—rather than explicitly harming other disciplines—this is often a facade: States are actively making cuts to the humanities and social sciences. This preferential treatment is a dangerous movement for the education system on several fronts.
For one, educational priorities should not be defined by future income alone. Such a figure is inherently speculative and fails to take into account how the job market will evolve in the next ten to fifteen years and beyond. Demand for jobs and skills inevitably changes, and exclusive focus on one set of disciplines suggests the quixotic conclusion that our economic and cultural landscape will remain static forever.
Fostering a range of disciplines in which the humanities continue to have equal billing is the only model that can adequately anticipate the challenges of the future. Even from an economic standpoint, a holistic approach emphasizing the notion of “education for education’s sake” is the most rational choice in the long term.
But the consequences of slashed funds for the humanities are not limited to effects in the distant future. Our neglect for the humanities also intimately affects the continued viability of this nation’s democratic ideals. Failure to sustain a holistic intellectual and cultural education—one that includes the study of the past and of ideas—will ultimately leave citizens ill equipped to engage in the self-reflection and self-criticism that is fundamental to any democratic system.
Commentators on all sides of the political spectrum would agree that one root of our country's current struggles is a failure appreciate the intellectual and cultural ideals that should guide our policies. Whether you think that we have strayed too far from our founding principles of limited government, believe that Americans too often ignore the contemporary legacies of our nation's racial past, or both, your concerns are ultimately rooted in questions of history, philosophy, and human nature often addressed by art and literature. In short, a humanities education is essential for ensuring that the voters of tomorrow are able to engage in open, incisive, and—perhaps most crucially—empathetic intellectual discourse about the fundamental issues underlying the political process.
Of course, the sciences are and will remain vital. But they must be anchored in a educational system that also values the rigorous study of human culture in all its manifestations. It is in all of our best interests—and in the best interest of democracy—to continue to fund the humanities at public universities.

Before he tumbled, Jeb Bush promised the Right to Rise. John Kasich wants you ready for a New Day for America, Marco Rubio looks further to A New American Century, and Donald Trump, of course, is pledging to Make American Great Again. Sloganitis extends to Democrats too: Martin O’Malley’s misbegotten campaign spoke of Generation Forward, while Bernie Sanders speaks of “political revolution.”
Almost everyone promises radical political reinvention, as if the hopelessly recalcitrant Congress would dissipate if he or she wished it so.
Consider Sanders, for example. Given that Congressional Republicans now deny the basic duty of the president to even nominate, with the advice of consent of the Senate rather than its deigning, a justice to the Supreme Court, what hope is there a Sanders administration could actually abolish college tuition? Or raise taxes on the rich, and doubly so upon the well-protected mavens of Wall Street? Or correct the Supreme Court on campaign finance through a constitutional amendment of all things?
Without an actual political revolution or realignment materializing at the behest of a socialist septuagenarian, Americans would relive the familiar duping of “hope and change.”
That’s not to say that the Obama presidency will be remembered as a failure—far from it. But his signature achievements, like the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, or the deal with Iran, came out a bit crooked, refracted through the prism of pessimism and partisanship. And at the same time, civil libertarians have much to be disappointed by—the first targeted killing of an American citizen without a trial, the disclosure of broad-sweeping surveillance programs, and the continued detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
But incrementalism—the kind endorsed by Hillary Clinton, whose essential campaign promise is to continue the Obama years—makes for much less tantalizing campaigns.
And in our hyperpolarized era, it might not even make sense. There are two basic ways that a candidate may gain votes through effective campaigning: either by convincing some voters to change their minds or encouraging the registered adults already partial to their cause to actually show up to the polls. Given that primary participation rates in the last presidential election hovered around 20 percent, it’s reasonable to assume that the turnout effect—the kind aroused by negative campaigning and stirring cries to break up the banks or deport illegal immigrants—is much more important than attempting to convince undecided voters.
In a hypothetical general election, a voter who decides to change his vote from Hillary Clinton to John Kasich—probably the two closest candidates across party lines left standing—would go from an outspoken advocate for abortion rights to a man who prides himself on defunding Planned Parenthood. From endorsing the Common Core to rejecting all federally mandated education standards. From supporting gun control to removing restrictions on concealed-carry licenses. All that is to say that the possibility seems marginal, and, further, the people on those margins would seem to be deeply confused about essentially everything anyway.
Mobilizing an electorate is not so easy. Donald Trump seems best at this sort of game, coming out with some brash statement, equal parts bombast and bluster, with hardly a sniff of substance that is duly rehashed over the airwaves and recounted in articles for the next several days. It seems that Trump is well on his way to the nomination by crowding out his rivals through sheer ridiculousness, through complete asphyxiation of the political arena. He has won the past three primaries, each accompanied by high, sometimes record-setting, turnouts.
We lionize this as the year of the outsider, but the real problem might be less fundamental. Though much remains for the establishment to fret about, it may just be that, these days, the silent and sullen majority stays home—dejected and demobilized, unenthused with the establishment but not wholeheartedly committed to its undoing.
And yet, were this dejection to yield a President Cruz or—and it really pains me to have to write the next three words—a President Trump, then the times really would be a changin’. We might not like that so much.

To the editor:
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announces that the supervisors of the Houses are henceforth to be called "Dean,” like himself.
Like everyone else he would agree, the abandoned title "Master" derives from nothing offensive (only today, its echo is offensive). On the other hand, "Dean" in a university sense derives from the Roman Catholic church by way of Oxford and Cambridge, by way of the Anglican Church. These ties were severed by the American Revolution.
Bishop Seabury presiding at the time over the King's Church in America, from which the Puritans had once sought refuge, was a Yale graduate, beginning his ecclesiastical career with ordination as dean—that is, "deacon" (both English words, like the French doyen, variant derivatives of the Latin diaconus). An ardent Tory, he fled to England to regain accreditation as head of his sect under the name "American Episcopal,” and returned in that guise to the United States.
It must obviously offend Americans who value the Puritan story and all Protestant sects, to have over them supervisors with a title that recalls such a line of descent. But then, maybe they can live with their own history, which for everyone everywhere must be in some way offensive, and instructive.

Ramsay MacMullen AB '50, AM '53, PhD '57 is an emeritus professor of history at Yale.

Harvard is rolling out the red carpet for President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, inviting him to speak this Friday and Saturday at the Harvard Kennedy School, the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Africa Business Conference.
Kagame gained respectability for ending the Rwandan 1994 genocide and for bringing stable governance to his previously beleaguered country.  As a result, he enjoys the support of a wide range of influential public personalities including Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Bill Gates and Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz.
But incontrovertible facts have emerged, and they bring to light the other side of Kagame’s story.  According to the Rwanda scholar Filip Reyntjens, Kagame is “probably the worst war criminal in office today.”
In 2002, Americans were warned by ABC News’ Ted Koppel, who introduced the first documentary on the war in Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo DRC) by stating, “At the heart of the continent, genocide in a tiny country [Rwanda], a genocide that horrified the world, brought chaos to a country almost 100 times its size [the Congo DRC], and you probably haven’t heard a word…. It has claimed more lives than all the other current wars around the world combined. But outside of Africa, no one seems to have noticed." The program went on to observe, "[September 11th] was the day when 3,000 people died in the World Trade Center alone. In Congo, almost that many people have died each and every day.” Kagame was the key instigator of these events.
In 2008, 40 Rwandan officers were prosecuted by the Spanish judge Fernando Andreu Merelles for "genocide, crimes against humanity and terrorism," and Kagame was implicated for claiming 4 million lives in his quest for geo-strategical supremacy. Protected by his immunity as a head of state, Kagame could not be indicted.
In 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Commission issued a mapping of human rights violations in the Congo DRC from 1993 to 2003, and raised the question of whether some of Kagame’s actions might be classified "crimes of genocide."
At home, Kagame is ruling with an iron hand by quashing and eradicating the opposition and by muzzling the media. Victoire Ingabire, a Sakharov prize nominee, was arrested and jailed because she planned to run for the presidency. Patrick Karegeya, a former intelligence officer and close collaborator of Kagame’s, was assassinated in a hotel in Johannesburg, South Africa. As a reaction, Kagame stated that treason brings consequences, adding that “anyone who betrays our cause or wishes our people ill will fall victim. What remains to be seen is how you fall victim.” In 2014, soon after the BBC broadcasted “Rwanda’s Untold Story,” a documentary challenging Kagame and his role in the 1994 genocide, Rwanda pushed for criminal action against the channel, and BBC broadcasting was consequently suspended in Rwanda.
Over the last weeks, the international community has strongly criticized Kagame for obstructing the democratic transition of his own country, and for his destabilizing role in the African Great Lakes region. At a time when Africa is thirsty for sustainable democracy, Kagame – de-facto leader of Rwanda since 1994 – has set an adverse precedent by pushing a constitutional reform that granted himself the opportunity to stay in power until 2034.  And ironically, the hero who once ended the 1994 mass killing in Rwanda is fueling a crisis in Burundi that may well lead to another genocide.
While not an open supporter of Kagame, Harvard has provided a powerful platform for Kagame on several occasions in the past. In 2001, when the war that Kagame fueled in the Congo DRC was costing thousands of lives every day, Kagame was invited to speak at the Harvard Kennedy School. In 2013, after the US and several European nations suspended aid to Rwanda amid allegations that Rwanda supported rebel insurgencies in Congo, Kagame spoke at the Harvard Business School as a guest of prominent professor Michael Porter.  Now, despite growing criticisms from the international community, Kagame has once again been invited to speak at Harvard-related events. It is certain that the accommodation of Kagame by such a prestigious institution as Harvard has been fueling Kagame’s propaganda both domestically and internationally.
Does Harvard want to keep letting its name be used by a ruthless dictator? I do not think so. It is hard to imagine that Harvard would open its doors to leaders that are responsible for similar such atrocities, such as Bashar al-Assad of Syria or Omar al-Bashir from Sudan.
By welcoming Kagame, Harvard is abdicating its moral responsibility to denounce tyrannical regimes and to give a voice to the voiceless.  Our motto as a school is Veritas—truth. Yet this weekend, we find ourselves not speaking truth to power. This is wrong.

Sacha Yabili was born and raised in the Congo DRC, and he is a student at the Harvard Business School.

The Divinity School is preparing to launch its newest edX course next Tuesday aimed at promoting religious literacy, and Harvard expects tens of thousands of participants over the course of its initial six month run.
The course, titled “World Religions Through Their Scriptures,” consists of six month-long modules covering an introduction to religious literacy and five of the major world religions: Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and Judaism, according to the course’s site.
Combining pre-recorded instructional videos with discussion boards, course sessions will be gradually released twice a week to foster “real-time” engagement among the course participants, according to Diane L. Moore, the faculty lead for the course and director of the Divinity School’s Religious Literacy Project. Moore will share the teaching burden with five other instructors.
For the first month, course participants will be able to join weekly live discussions with their professors through Google Hangouts. At the end of its first six month run, the course will be archived so that future participants can proceed at their own pace, Moore said.
Between 50 to 100 thousand participants are expected to sign up for the course, according to Zachary S. Davis, the HarvardX project lead who was involved in the production and implementation of the course.
“I think there’s a huge hunger to understand religion better, and I think most of the resources available don’t approach religion from a cultural understanding,” Davis said. “What our course is helping people to do is to get a holistic view of these religions.”
The program has been in development for the past year, Davis said, pointing to collaboration between the six instructors.
“Getting faculty to work together collaboratively is not something that Harvard is typically known for, but in this case, HarvardX is really providing a new way for this kind of group collaboration to take place, and it’s producing some extraordinary results,” Davis said.
Moore highlighted the level of cohesion among the modules and subject matter as a key aspect of the course, and said common themes were developed and interwoven throughout the modules.
“We do have a shared framework, a shared message that we are trying to respond to so that there’s consistency across the modules, while there’s also lots of opportunity for individual creativity,” Moore said.
The course professors received substantial support from the HarvardX team in developing the material, according to Moore.
“It’s been quite a learning curve for all of us,” Moore said. “And it’s been fascinating, actually, to think creatively about pedagogy in this context.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences professor Ali S. Asani ’77, who will be teaching the Islam module of the course, said the lack of religious literacy is both an international and national issue.
“The whole project of democracy is threatened,” Asani said. “When you pick on a minority group and you seek to exclude it from the national discourse, you think about it as the ‘other’.”
Asani said educating people about the complexities of religions and cultures not only improves religious literacy, but also overcomes stereotypes and fosters trust among citizens despite their religious differences.
“We’re seeing growing polarizations in the world, due to all kinds of difference, but particularly religious difference,”  Asani said.
Religious illiteracy in the United States has specifically contributed to feelings of anti-Muslim prejudice, Asani said.
“They very often focus on the Quran, and they call the Quran a text of terrorism,” Asani said. “That’s because they’re uneducated about really how scriptures work, how religions traditions work, and how people interpret scriptures in many different ways.”
A panel of professors involved in the project will speak at the Divinity School next Tuesday, when the first installment of the course is set to launch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard political student groups are refocusing their energies on Massachusetts ahead of next week’s Super Tuesday, when 12 states will hold primaries and caucuses in the presidential election.
On the Republican side, Harvard Students for Rubio has been actively phone-banking and canvassing throughout Massachusetts. The transition back into the state follows a successful period of calling into South Carolina, New Hampshire, Iowa, and Nevada, Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, National Co-Chair of Students for Rubio, said.
The Harvard student group experienced some difficulty with canvassing in the Cambridge area, given the lower concentration of Republican voters. Still, Khansarinia said the group will do everything possible to ensure that they do not “cede any part of the state.”
“We will be working very hard across the state to door knock. It’s not as easy as it is for our counterparts on the left. We can’t just walk around Cambridge, Boston, and Jamaica Plains because there simply aren’t any Republican voters there,” Khansarinia said.
Harvard Students for Rubio will be focusing their efforts in central, western, and northern Massachusetts primarily, and have plans to canvass in Vermont and Maine before voters in both states go to the polls next week.
“If someone says ‘don’t campaign there,’ we’re going to campaign there because Marco Rubio is the candidate who can reach across party lines,” he said. “We’re not ready to cede that vote to anybody.”
Harvard Students for Bernie, meanwhile, have been making similar efforts in phone-banking and canvassing, with plans to focus their campaigning in and around the Cambridge area, said He Li ’16, president of Harvard Students for Bernie. The group will canvass throughout the weekend and on Super Tuesday will focus on encouraging already dedicated Sanders’ supports to “Get Out The Vote.”
“In the days leading up to the primary on Tuesday, we will be focusing on getting out the vote through the weekend and on the Tuesday, the primary day,” Li said. “We’re going to be reminding people to show their support by going to the polls.”
In addition to canvassing and phone-banking, the group also took a trip to Central Square on Monday evening where the founders of Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream company distributed free ice cream to show support for the Vermont senator.
On the other side of the Democrats, Harvard Students for Hillary have been working with other Boston-area colleges on phone-banking and door-to-door canvassing. The group has arranged three to four phone-banks a week, primarily into the Boston area, and canvassing trips on the weekends close to campus, according to Michael K. Kikukawa ’17, outreach captain of Harvard Students for Hillary.
Kikukawa said that phone-banking into Massachusetts has been more rewarding than in other states because locals have been more willing to learn about the merits of the candidates.
“I think the Massachusetts voters have been a little less saturated with calls than the New Hampshire voters so they are more receptive to being talked to about who is the best candidate for the Democrats and who is the best person to be President of the United States,” he said.
The latest poll conducted by Emerson College Polling Society and released Feb. 22 has Clinton and Sanders tied at 46 percent each, and Businessman Donald J. Trump 34 percent ahead of Rubio in Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of five Harvard Law and roughly 15 to 20 Brandeis protesters stood at the back of the Brandeis library where Minow delivered an acceptance speech, holding signs and interjecting with a chant charging that Minow has not done enough to address racism at the school.
The Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize recognizes individuals “whose body of published work reflects scholarly excellence and makes a lasting contribution to racial, ethnic or religious relations,” according to a Brandeis announcement.  Along with the award, Minow received $25,000.
Brandeis announced Minow as this year’s award recipient in October. A press release from the university highlighted Minow’s work on divided societies, the legacy of desegregation in American education, and international peace-building.
Between the time Brandeis announced the award in October and Thursday’s ceremony, Minow has regularly confronted problems related to race relations at the Law School, which has seen a wave of diversity-related activism over the past few months. After a racially-charged incident of vandalism in November, student activists in the group Reclaim Harvard Law issued a series of demands, calling on administrators to improve treatment of minorities at the Law School.
Additionally, students have denounced the Law School’s seal, which bears the crest of a former slaveholding family. In late November, Minow created a committee to reconsider the school’s controversial seal and pledged to hire more minority faculty members. More recently, she announced a series of initiatives intended to  improve diversity and inclusion at the school. Student activists, however, continue to criticize Minow and other administrators for not fully responding to their specific demands. They have been occupying a Law School student lounge—which they have dubbed “Belinda Hall”–for more than a week in protest.
Before Thursday’s ceremony and protest occurred, Law professor Randall Kennedy, who has worked closely with Minow, said that he thought the award was aptly timed.
“Dean Minow is a person who is deeply concerned about the wide array of issues–political, pedagogical, moral, ethical–that is generating student activism,” Kennedy said. “It seems to me that it is altogether fitting that she should get this prize at this moment.”
Activists, however, said they perceived the timing of the prize as “ironic.” Reclaim Harvard Law spokesperson Alexander J. Clayborne said his group decided to attend the ceremony with activists from Brandeis’ Ford Hall movement, who protested what they said was their university’s lack of diverse faculty last fall. This is not the first instance of collaboration between the two groups; Brandeis activists joined Reclaim Harvard Law’s occupation last week, along with students from Yale Law School and Occidental College.
“Dean Minow has done a lot of academic work to enhance the cause of racial justice and social justice in general, and we felt that it was ironic that she was receiving an award for this activity when her actions don’t correspond to that here at Harvard Law School,” Clayborne said.
In the back of the Brandeis library room, protesters held signs and a re-creation of the Law School’s seal depicting black individuals carrying sheaves of wheat on their back. Interrupting Minow’s remarks, activists called her acceptance of the prize “hypocrisy” and “a travesty.”
“You came to Brandeis to talk a big game, but injustice is in Cambridge. Your school is racist. Your school is not inclusive,” protesters chanted. Borrowing Minow’s own language in the speech, they said, “Today we upstand. We speak out in public. We face danger. We build anti-racism while you bystand.”
After the interruption, Minow continued her speech. In a question and answer session afterwards, protesters asked why Minow had not yet visited “Belinda Hall,” the location of their ongoing sit-in. While the dean responded that she had visited three times, activists had not seen her, Clayborne said.

In preparation for Junior Parents Weekend, the College and Cambridge are abuzz with activity to welcome parents who have traveled from near and far to get a taste of their children’s Harvard life.
The annual tradition brings parents of junior undergraduates to campus for a weekend full of programming, showcasing elements of students’ academic and extracurricular life. The slate of events includes open houses, museum tours, House receptions, faculty presentations, various performances, and even a jogging tour of campus.
As the weekend approaches, juniors have different plans for how to make the most of their parents’ brief visit.
Pietro Galeone ’17, whose parents flew from Italy for an extended weekend, plans to explore different types of restaurants with them.
“My parents like to eat a different kind of food every time, so I think we’ll go from cuisine to cuisine,” Galeone said.
Other students, like Maximilian G. Seuss ’17, hope to venture into Boston. Seuss also plans to attend performances on campus put on by a variety of student groups, such as an improv comedy show.
Beyond the College, the city of Cambridge will also be affected this weekend, with many hotels and restaurants preparing for an influx of visitors. The College has coordinated with various hotels—including the Marriott Courtyard Boston Cambridge, the Boston Marriott Cambridge, and the Hyatt Regency Cambridge—to secure special rates for visiting parents.
Managers of hotels around Harvard Square said they expect the weekend to be busier than usual. Stanley W. Martin, general manager at the Marriott Courtyard Boston Cambridge, said Harvard parents have already booked around 30 rooms at the hotel.
Owners of Square restaurants, including Henrietta’s Table, and Legal Sea Foods, said they are expecting a similar uptick in business over the weekend. Andrew J. D’Alessandro, a manager of the Italian restaurant Toscano, said the restaurant is fully booked with reservations for the weekend, and its menu will feature some of its more popular dishes.
For students whose parents will not be coming, such as Matthew P. Browne ’17, this weekend will be like any other. Browne, who said his parents’ busy schedules did not permit them to visit, hopes to spend time with them soon.
“I’m fine with hanging out with them any weekend, even if it’s not Parents Weekend,” he said.

This year’s Ghungroo—a flurry of dance, music, spoken word, and acting—featured a new focus on issues of mental health in South Asian communities, and included a revamped charity component of the show.
The event, organized by the Harvard South Asian Association, is currently in its 27th year and sold out over 1200 tickets.
Harvard’s Ghungroo team this year was comprised of almost 350 individuals—choreographers, dancers, stage design artists, writers, and tech support. This year, the show, spanning from February 25 to February 27 at the Agassiz Theater, was produced by SAA’s co-presidents Kavya Pathak ’17 and Nishant Kakar ’17 and directed by co-directors Kruti B. Vora ’17, Madhavi L. Narayanan ’17, and Avi Saraf ’17.
The co-directors and the show’s tech team, “Gtech,” decided to introduce pertinent social messages through a traditionally humorous and lighthearted medium.
“We thought with this many people in our audience, let’s use this space to really create a meaningful dialogue so that people can extend [it] outside of just the theater and talk about [it] for hopefully a long time to come,” Vora said.
In early October, the team of directors and technical crew brainstormed different issues affecting South Asian students that were important to them and could be similarly meaningful for a larger audience. After narrowing down alternative options, the group settled on mental health and South Asian stigmas regarding mental health, according to Vora.
“Ghungroo is already so meaningful to so many people’s lives, so we decided to add another layer of meaning to it,” Kausalya Mahadevan ’17, one of the show’s choreographers and dance directors, said.
Consequently, every aspect of the show—the mood of different acts, the skit, the music, the character developments—reflect the overarching theme of mental health awareness.
With the new changes came some challenges, one of which was balancing the identity and expectations of 27 years of tradition with the new additions. “For example, we were trying to add humor into the skit while also making sure we were tactful and respectful,” Saraf said.
The team also wanted to bring back the charity aspect of the show, harkening back to its origins as a relief fund for the Nepal flood victims, Vora said. This year, the show is soliciting donations towards the non-profit Counselors Helping (South) Asian/Indians, which focuses on ending stigma of mental health in South Asian communities and increasing the availability of needed services.
“The reason we chose CHAI is because they are uniquely focused both on the cultural stigmas that come with mental health, but also focused on bringing those issues into North America as well,” Narayanan said.
With the new elements, the show's leaders hope Ghungroo will hold greater significance for audience members and larger South Asian American communities as well.

Faculty in Applied Mathematics and Environmental Science and Engineering may have some unusual neighbors moving in come 2020: decaying whale skeletons and rotting coral reefs.
As Harvard finalizes plans for the School of Engineering and Applied Science’s new Allston campus, the school’s current neighbors, from the Museum of Comparative Zoology to the Physics Department, are eagerly eyeing the space in Cambridge it will vacate.
Under current plans, the much-hyped new campus will be home to Computer Science and Bioengineering in their entirety, while Electrical Engineering and Materials Science will partially relocate to Allston, beginning in 2020. These moves could open up significant space alongside the SEAS teaching areas remaining in Cambridge: Applied Mathematics, Applied Physics, and Environmental Science and Engineering.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators are gauging other departments’ interest in the vacated space, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith. He said departments in the crowded Sciences Division and various museums have expressed interesting in using that space.
SEAS, however, will have first dibs, Francis J. Doyle III, Dean of SEAS, said.
“What other units outside of SEAS do is really conversations with Mike Smith and part of his planning process,” Doyle said. “I know he’s looking to us first to figure out how we’re going to reconfigure within our footprint back here.”
Though Doyle said there have been no “policy decisions” made on who will occupy the soon-to-be vacated space, he is not surprised about the interest.
“It’s human nature,” Doyle said. “I think there probably will be squatters and vultures kind of circling—space is the ultimate commodity on any university campus.”
Indeed, at Harvard, space is king. The Physics Department’s relative lack of office and laboratory space makes hiring new research-based professors difficult, department chair Masahiro Morii said.
“In physical sciences, the availability of laboratory space often limits our ability to attract the best talent,” Morii said, adding that laboratory space is often a point of contention when negotiating hiring packages. Creating new laboratory space far from Harvard Yard is not an optimal solution, he said.
“For a while there was an attempt to house some of the experimental groups in Alewife,” Morii said. “But it turns out that the back-and-forth time is just prohibitive—especially if the Red Line doesn’t work.”
Not all Science departments are interested in the new SEAS buildings, however, and not all interested parties fall within the Sciences.
The Astronomy Department, for instance, has not expressed interest in the SEAS buildings, department chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb said. The Law School, whose campus borders SEAS’s current location, is “interested in the possibilities that available space might create,” Law School Dean for Administration Francis X. McCrossan wrote in an emailed statement. McCrossan noted, however, that the school has “yet to engage in any substantive conversations about this.”
On the other side of Oxford Street, some of Harvard’s museums also fancy the prospect of much-needed space. James Hanken, director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, said he has no room to store many of his collections, and that specimens stored in the museum’s main building are degrading as a result of improper temperature and humidity controls.
Though the museum recently added 50,000 square feet of  collection and lab space in the climate-controlled basement of the Northwest building, Hanken said the additional space is not enough to house all collections adequately.
Some of MCZ’s largest specimens are currently stored off-site at Concord Field Station in Bedford, Mass. There, the skeletons of whales, porpoises, and other large animals lie in underground missile silos that contained Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles during the Cold War.
“It’s a terrible environment again insofar as it’s not climate-controlled, it’s very humid, we have a lot of historically famous coral reefs, dried coral reefs, that ... are literally rotting because of the combination of inappropriate temperature,” Hanken said. “Those are collections that we would desperately like to find a better home for.”
Even in the museum itself, many skeletons and skulls stored in the main building’s attic and top floor are falling apart, Hanken said.
“These are in some instances extinct species, in other cases they are endangered species, and in many instances they are specimens that we could no longer replace,” Hanken said. “They’re incredibly valuable historical records of Earth’s biological history—they’re literally irreplaceable, and it’s our obligation, professional obligation, to conserve these things as best we can.”
“We literally see them falling apart right in front of our eyes,” he said.
Representatives for the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the Harvard Semitic Museum, and the Harvard Art Museums said they have not expressed interest in the new buildings.
Details on when and how potential Cambridge space will become available remain unclear. Morii said a visiting committee to the Physics Department noted the lack of clear plans for the transition.
“One of the things [the committee] said was, ‘You guys don’t seem to know how you’re going to coordinate this in the first place.’ Nobody they talked to inside the University knew exactly what the timeframe of this move is,’” said Morii. “We were like, ‘Yeah, we noticed.’”
Morii said he suspects SEAS administrators will want to “consolidate group spaces in a more rational way” after the partial move in 2020 before freeing up space to others, a process he estimates could take more than a year.
Doyle said his “first priority is figuring out how we reconfigure and where faculty might be stretched across hallways or buildings or floors,” emphasizing the importance of related faculty having “contiguous space.”
Though Smith said conversations have started, he added that they have “not been finalized by any stretch of the imagination.”

A lengthy negotiation process between Harvard and its largest employee union has come to a conclusion as union members voted to ratify the tentative agreement reached between the two parties exactly one month ago.
Bill Jaeger, the executive director of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that while all of the votes have not been tallied yet, there was a “resounding yes vote” in favor of ratifying the tentative agreement. Jaeger added that nearly 2,000 ballots had been tallied thus far and that a significant percentage of the votes were in favor of ratification.
“The yes-vote percentage is going to be somewhere between 95 and 98 percent,” Jaeger said. “That’s an overwhelming margin, I think.”
In an emailed statement, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said Harvard was “very pleased” at the outcome of the vote, which she said “advances the interests of the University and the HUCTW.”
“Harvard values the many contributions that HUCTW members make to our community each day,” Lapp said. “We look forward to continuing to work together in making Harvard one of the best places to learn, work, and live.”
Voting took place at more than 25 different locations throughout the greater Massachusetts area on Thursday. Additionally, about 30 HUCTW members employed at research center Dumbarton Oaks in Washington D.C. completed their vote on-site, and will have their ballots transported to HUCTW’s offices within the next few days.
“The elections committee won’t be able to certify final results until tomorrow or Monday because we have a couple of ballot boxes from our remote locations that aren’t going to come in until tomorrow,” Jaeger said.
The ratification vote comes after a negotiation process that extended nearly four months past the expiration date of HUCTW’s previous contract, and included the intervention of outside mediators from Harvard and MIT. HUCTW members have been aware of the details of the agreement since early February. Since the announcement, the union has held information meetings and established a hotline to field any questions about contract details.
Members largely praised the contents of the agreement, citing the removal of deductibles and coinsurance payments from the contract as major improvements over the benefits Harvard’s non-union members receive. Additionally, the establishment of a new premium tier for members whose salaries fall under $55,000 was lauded by HUCTW leadership as a keystone of the new agreement.
Still, discussion surrounding the contract has not been completely positive. At an event in support of Harvard University Dining Services on Wednesday evening, HUCTW member Thompson Potter criticized the agreement and called for “militant union activism” to address what he perceived as  deficiencies in the healthcare details, as well as to prevent members of HUDS from ending up with the same plan.
“This deal enshrines the very costs, the very fights that you are fighting for,” Potter said.

With free t-shirts and pizza, Harvard’s Athletics Department is successfully luring increasing numbers of students across the river to attend varsity sports games through its CrimZone Rewards program and has doubled attendance at select games.
Launched in the spring of 2011, the program was implemented to increase enthusiasm and attendance for Harvard’s sports teams among the student body.
Recognizing that students often have many different activities vying for their time, Susan Byrne, Harvard’s Associate Director of athletics, said the department has gone all out in promoting a select few games to raise attendance.
“Students are busy, they have a lot going on,” Byrne said. “We have found that we get the best results if we can take a few games and just use all our promotion methods.”
CrimZone Rewards is a multi-pronged system in which students receive free giveaways at many athletic events, accumulate points for attending athletic events by checking in on the CrimZone mobile application, and win extra points for attending designated feature events.
Byrne said many athletic contests designated as featured events on the CrimZone app showed some of the largest growth in attendance.
Andrew C. Vatistas, Athletics marketing manager, said the CrimZone program helped set attendance records for Men’s varsity hockey. More than 590 students attended their Ivy League championship game on Feb. 19 against Cornell, he said.
Attendance at Women’s Rugby and Baseball and Softball games have increased by about 250 and 1,000 percent respectively since the rewards program launched, according to Vatistas.
Still, the record breaking crowds and popularity among students is a relatively new phenomenon. Not many people used the prgoram at its launch, but Vatistas said participation has grown rapidly over the last year.
“We forecast a 60 percent increase [in check-ins] year over year, just from last year,” he said.
He added that rewarding students with prizes through the app is not the only reason for higher levels of attendance. Communication with students about the logistics of the sporting events has improved as well.
“Overall awareness has increased tremendously from when we started four years ago,” Vatistas said. “Along with the notifications through our app, a lot of it is social media and our weekly email blast.”
The app has also allowed the Athletics Department to better collect data and track attendance patterns.
“As recently as 2010 there was very little that we did to track how many students were at our games.” Vatistas said. “We’re really trying to do a better job of getting information out there and bridging the gap and trying to engage as best we can to make it easier for students.”
Harvard’s CrimZone Rewards program is not unique within the Ivy League. The University of Pennsylvania uses a similar program that allows students and fans to check in at games and earn points, which can later be redeemed for prizes.
In an email, Joshua Craggs, University of Pennsylvania Athletics’ director of marketing and new media, wrote that his department has “amped up our fan loyalty program (mostly used by students).  This year we have had excellent success with student attendance at many of our events due to both of these efforts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee recently passed legislation to cap theater performance grants at $16,500 per semester, after funding towards theater groups spiked to more than $35,000 last academic year.
The committee voted unanimously to pass the proposal, entitled the “Open Theatre Budget Ordinance of 2016,” during a meeting Wednesday evening. Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said he designed the legislation to address the increasing amounts of money the UC has allocated to theater productions in recent years.
Greenlaw said that during the 2014-2015 academic year, the UC invested a record sum in theatrical productions on campus, and projected that at the current rate of increase, the UC would allocate an additional $5,000 to theater groups this calendar year, potentially diverting funding away from other student events.
“Given that the average non-theatrical event in Fall 2015 received $164.31, this projected increase would crowd out 30 other campus events or more per semester starting in Fall 2016,” the legislation stated.
The UC will now cap funding to theater groups at $16,500 this semester as a pilot program and introduce an additional $5,000 for groups that align their performances with the UC’s “compelling interests,” according to the approved legislation.
Current Finance Committee policy caps funding for theatrical performances at $1,000 each, but places no cap on the total amount of theater funding that the UC can allocate each semester out of its grants budget, which generally hovers around $300,000 in total.
In addition to the $16,500 semesterly figure, an additional $5,000 fund, called the “Compelling Interest Theatre Budget,” will be made available to theatrical productions whose themes align with the UC’s current compelling interests: mental health, sexual assault and harassment, race relations, and social spaces. The compelling interests, proposed by UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 and passed by the UC, are also at the core of the Council’s separate $30,000 “Grant for an Open Harvard College”.
Greenlaw said the $5,000 fund will help keep undergraduates focused on the UC’s compelling interests.
“People forget, and only engage with the issues when something dramatic happens,” Greenlaw said. “We need to find ways to encourage people to engage with these issues without having something bad happen.”
Leaders of various theater organizations said the UC’s new funding cap and additional theater grant are well-intentioned, but could harm theater groups that heavily rely on Council funding.
Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club Treasurer Caro P. Ribeiro ’18 said the new policy could encourage theater organizations to increase focus on campus-wide issues.
“I think in some sense it’s really good,” she said. Still, Ribeiro said theater organizations have already made efforts to focus on the subjects the UC is promoting.
“I think our theater community, by the nature of what's happening on our campus, is becoming increasingly aware of these issues,” Ribeiro said. “A lot of the shows that are being put up this semester are ones that are about sexual assault, issues of race, and that just happened without any financial incentive.”
Ribeiro also raised concerns about whether the $16,500 semesterly cap on funding would be sufficient for theater organizations on campus.
“Normally it’s the standard for you to get $500 from the Office of Fine Arts and then $1,000 from the UC,” she said. “So this basically means that only 16 and a half shows can get the funding, and we do over 20 shows a semester easily.”
HRDC President Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 expressed similar concern over the funding cap, arguing that smaller shows in particular could be threatened by the policy.
“It really means that we’re going to have to reassess what it’s going to mean for our smaller productions,” Brophy said.
In response to such concerns, Greenlaw said he doesn’t expect any theater groups to lose out on funding this semester from the cap.
“The aggregate amount of money we budgeted for this pilot program far exceeds what folks have asked for,” Greenlaw wrote in a message. “I don't see any organization receiving any less money than they normally would have gotten had this policy never been invented.”
Brophy criticized the UC’s decision, which she said was made without the input of theater groups.
“It seems to have been a fairly closed decision that the UC made without directly consulting anybody who is very affiliated with theater,” Brophy said.
Greenlaw said he would be willing to have a discussion with theater organizations in the future, should demand for theater funding continue to increase.
Some theater leaders also questioned scheduling changes that will go into effect under the new policy. The new policy will require all theater productions requesting funding to interview with the Finance Committee on a single designated date during the semester. Under the prior model, theater organizations could request funding at any point during the academic year.
“It’s strange,” freshman musical producer Henry M.N Brooks ’19 said. “If there’s not enough money for all the shows, then the shows have to justify [their grant requests] against each other.”
“That feels like competition in a way that HRDC and theater at Harvard isn’t supposed to feel like,” he added.
During Wednesday’s meeting, Greenlaw recognized potential concerns from theater leaders over the new policy, but defended the UC’s right to control funding procedures.
“We are not infringing on people’s theatrical freedom,” Greenlaw said. “It’s entirely within our purview to encourage organizations to thematically link what they’re doing to what’s important to the college’s campus. That’s because the UC serves the undergraduate body at large.”
The theater legislation is the second major finance reform the committee has passed this month, following an earlier ordinance to mandate sexual assault training for organizations seeking large grants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today’s civil institutions reflect the legacy of the Black Power movement, argued Joyce M. Bell in her lecture,“Race and Resistance: The Lasting Legacy of the Black Power Movement” at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Wednesday.
The Black Power movement allowed black people dissatisfied with the limited progress made by more moderate civil rights activists, such as Martin Luther King Jr., in the early 1960s to demand further racial equality, according to Bell, who is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota and a 2015-2016 fellow at the Radcliffe Institute.
“Black Power gave voice to a generation of black people who wanted more, more than the Civil Rights movement was asking for, and certainly more than the establishment was willing to give,” she said.
Bell emphasized that the Black Power movement prioritized “radical social change” through its focus on strengthening the black community, while simultaneously rejecting white cultural norms and values.
“Black power rejected the peaceful, nonviolent approach of the Civil Rights Movement, claiming instead that Black Liberation was an immediate emergency matter of survival,” Bell said. “The Black Power movement threw off the decorum of someone like King and chose to speak plainly, forcefully, and without regard for white feelings.”
Bell also discussed the impact of black professional organizations in supporting and encouraging efforts to consciously resist assimilation.
“These organizations were formed and served as the vehicle for protests within the professions,” Bell said.
Bell concluded her lecture by noting the Black Power movement’s resonance with young people, particularly those who are leading the Black Lives Matter and the New Black Student movements on college campuses. She said she hoped attendees would reflect upon the movement’s lasting legacy, but also upon society’s enduring racial inequalities.
“Knowing that so many black people see 2016 as so similar to 1966 should raise many more curiosities, and quite frankly, should give us all pause,” Bell said.
Jackie D. Bass, who attended the event, said she was impressed by the lecture, mentioning that she left with more appreciation for the Black Power movement’s impact on society.
“We don’t appreciate how impactful the Black Power movement was, that it wasn’t just this limited movement that went away, that it had a long lasting legacy,” Bass said.
Christopher Massenburg, the Nasir Jones Fellow at the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard commended Bell’s account of her new book, currently titled "Black Power Lawyers: Unique and Unorthodox Methods," that she is writing while at Radcliffe.
The book focuses on the organizational history of the National Conference of Black Lawyers, and the impact of the Black Power movement on the organizations and its lawyers.
“I admired the attorneys’ response to the necessity for legal representation by folks who were black,” Massenburg said. “Dr. Bell did a great job of guiding us through her thinking and tying everything together in a really good way.”
Bell’s lecture is part of the 2015-2016 Fellows’ Presentation Series at Radcliffe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A committee of Allston residents and Boston officials heard the first proposals for how to best distribute $5.35 million Harvard previously granted for projects in the neighborhood at a meeting on Thursday.
Harvard disbursed the money to the eight-person board, termed the Flexible Fund Executive Committee, as part of the University’s $43 million community benefits package detailed in its master plan for its Allston developments.
In presentations to the public published online by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Harvard labeled the grant a “flexible fund” for later projects and specified only that the money should be used to improve the “public realm.” The BRA is Boston’s urban planning agency.
Committee members and local residents said they remain unsure about what, exactly, the flexible fund can support.
“Sometimes there’s a little bit of a gray area about what constitutes the public realm,” Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager, said at the meeting. This uncertainty was reflected in the variety of different proposals entertained by the executive committee at the meeting.
Though the official application process is yet to begin, the BRA selected representatives from agencies including Boston Parks and Recreation, the Solomon Foundation, and the Boston Police Department to give brief presentations on potential uses for the grant money.
Suggested projects ranged from the renovation of a run-down amphitheatre in Allston’s Herter Park to the installation of neighborhood security cameras.
“If a crime occurs, we would have the video at our fingertips, we wouldn’t be guessing,” said Michael O’Hara, a police sergeant who spoke on behalf of the BPD. “We stop crime in the City of Boston using technology now… the detective days are over.”
Though committee members and attendees seemed united in support for O’Hara’s video camera proposal, other submissions received less praise. Two proposals in particular—one for the exterior renovation of the Honan-Allston Library and one for new smart boards and laptops for a local public school—garnered little interest from the executive committee.
“Funding technology and classrooms, my initial reaction is, as worthy a cause as that is, it’s not what this fund is about,” Autler said in response to the latter proposal.
During the meeting, Autler emphasized that no actual applications for project funding have been filed. After a brief discussion, the executive committee determined that an official application form would be posted online by the BRA on March 1.
In closing, Autler cautioned against either moving forward too swiftly or too slowly with the funding allocation process.
“My feeling is that we neither want to spend all the money all at once nor do we want to dole it out in small grants over the course of the next seven or eight years,” he said. “We want to come up with a strategy where we can channel significant amounts of money into a small number of high-impact projects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Education Redesign Lab at the Harvard Graduate School of Education has unveiled a new, youth education equity initiative that aims to tackle systemic inequalities preventing young students from academically succeeding.
Spanning six cities across the United States over several years, the program, dubbed “By All Means,” brings together community leaders, including health professionals, arts activists, superintendents, and each city’s mayor, in working groups to discuss and propose solutions on how to close “persistent achievement and opportunity gaps” for under-privileged youth, according to the official press release.
The participating cities—ranging from Oakland, California, to Somerville, Massachusetts—were selected based on their record of helping students achieve success.  In addition to the working groups, numerous national gatherings at the Graduate School of Education will allow the initiative's participants to connect with leading education policy leaders to discuss the future of 21st-century schooling.
S. Paul Reville, founding director of the Education Redesign Lab, said he believes the program’s holistic approach—encompassing health and wellness, out-of-school learning opportunities, and more—is well suited to address the needs of underserved youth.  The program diverges from previous initiatives at the lab which focused solely on addressing achievement gaps within the classroom.
“What we're basically saying is that the business of developing and educating children goes beyond what we’ve tasked the school system with doing, and it really becomes a community responsibility,” Reville said.
Reville also said this community-based approach aims to address a number of obstacles outside the classroom that limits the success of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  For instance, he said some families lack resources to participate in “high-quality summer enrichment experiences.”
“If we only concentrate on reforming those things that happen in school, we’re only treating a portion of the children’s lives, or a portion of the problem,” he said.
Mary E. Skipper, Superintendent of Somerville Public Schools in Massachusetts and graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said the goals of the initiative closely align with her district’s own goals for closing the achievement gap between students of various background.
“I think what’s unique about this [program] is that first, it brings together the city and it brings together the school districts, recognizing that one without the other really can’t make a meaningful difference in performance gaps for students and addressing whole child needs,” Skipper said.
In Oakland, the initiative will support a preexisting program, called the “Oakland Promise,”  that connects students and their families to educational resources in the city and provides financial incentives and support to continue education through college, according to David A. Silver, the newly appointed Director of Education in Oakland and a graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“What we are doing here is we’re creating not just an initiative or a moment in time, but a movement, and it’s something that everybody can get behind,” Silver said. “We’re actually scaling a program that works, that’s been in existence for 13 years, has a college completion rate of four times the national average, and just making it for more kids across Oakland.”
If the rollout of the program is successful, Reville said the lab hopes to expand the project to more interested cities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of the recent release of a campus sexual climate survey, some departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences aim to clarify reporting procedures and promote clear departmental expectations regarding sexual harassment.
The survey, conducted last spring, found that 19 percent of female and 16.9 percent of male graduate students reported being “very or extremely knowledgeable” about the resources available for students who had experienced sexual conduct, compared to 36.6 percent of female and 35.7 percent of male undergraduates. And of female graduate students surveyed who said they had been sexually harassed at Harvard, 21.8 percent reported that an offender was a faculty member, compared to 6.5 percent of female undergraduates.
“These are really, really shocking figures,” English Department Chair W. James Simpson said.
As Harvard grapples with the survey results, students within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences find themselves in a complex position: Many are both students and instructors, responsible for responding to undergraduate concerns about sexual harassment and navigating Harvard’s resources in their own personal cases of sexual harassment.
Several FAS departments are training their graduate students to respond to undergraduates’ concerns about sexual misconduct.
In October, a graduate student-organized group from the Music Department held a workshop to equip graduate students with information about College student reporting policies and on-campus resources.
The group, called the Graduate Student Forum, invited the recently-hired GSAS Title IX Coordinator  Seth Avakian and FAS Director of Student Services Jacqueline Yun to lead the workshop, which roughly 25 to 30 people—including faculty members—attended, according to Forum chair Hayley A. Fenn.
“The main thing in that meeting was trying to understand as teaching fellows how we might handle a disclosure and how we might best be there for our students,” Fenn said.
Music Department Chair Carol J. Oja said students held the October workshop in order to teach graduate students “to learn the protocol to follow if a student comes to tell you about an issue that’s taken place, just to sort of sensitize people and inform them about options.”
In the History Department, third-year graduate students are required to take a seminar on the practice of teaching, which this year included a week dedicated to the Title IX responsibilities of Ph.D. candidates as teachers and also their rights as students. Much of that discussion, according to History professor Alison F. Johnson, centers on teaching graduate students how to protect undergraduates’ rights should College students use their teaching fellows as resources.
The English Department has incorporated faculty training related to sexual harassment into its regular departmental meetings, Simpson said. The department had previously invited Title IX officers to one of their scheduled meetings, and Simpson said he later incorporated the information into a required presentation for all new faculty members and new graduate student-teachers.
Departments are not only concerned with how their graduate students advise undergraduates on issues of sexual harassment, though. Fenn said graduate students, especially teaching fellows, can maintain close  connection with faculty members, which some say creates complex relationships.
“It’s quite a complicated position, I think, being a teaching fellow, in terms of all these different kinds of power dynamics that surround us,” Fenn said.
Physics Department Chair Masahiro Morii said his department lacks meaningful statistics about sexual harassment and discrimination. Every year, Physics sends an anonymous survey to graduate students to solicit feedback about their experiences—including interactions with faculty—in the department.
But since only a quarter of Physics graduate students are women, and very few respond, Morii said the small sample size does not yield actionable results. He said it is important to enlist faculty in educating their graduate students on community standards and to make them a constructive part of reforming departmental culture.
The History Department also hopes to build these conversations on the faculty level, both in and outside of the department. At History Department faculty meetings, professors have discussed Title IX policies and procedures, and Johnson wrote that she has been asked to speak to other departments on the subject.
“It’s the kind of thing that we have to keep hitting the entire community of people constantly over and over again to make it sink into their mind, what’s acceptable, what’s not acceptable, and understand how much harm can come from seemingly—maybe those people are thinking—innocent words and acts,” Morii said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As hundreds of students explored popular restaurants in Harvard Square with their Datamatches over the past few weeks, others were not so lucky.
Roughly 1,500 Datamatch date requests—which this year would enable students to eat with their matches at Zinneken's Waffles, El Jefe's Tacqueria, Clover, and Pinkberry—were not accepted, according to this year’s Datamatch organizers. Datamatch, an annual online survey administered by the Harvard Computer Society, pairs Harvard students with other matches around Valentine’s Day after they answer a series of questions about their personalities and life at the College. The algorithm has been revised and kept secret by the Harvard Computer Society since 1994, and this year, the humor magazine Satire V helped craft the survey.
In total, 804 dates were scheduled throughout Harvard square this month, although space limitations prevented every match from getting a date. Due to concerns about overcrowding, Zinneken’s Waffles “declined to accept any Datamatch customers” last weekend, according to an email sent by Datamatch.
More than 4,000 people registered for Datamatch this year, an increase over the number of registered participants in 2014, and a number that represents more than 60 percent of the College’s undergraduates.
Raynor J. Kuang ’17, one of this year’s Datamatch organizers, said “a lot more women signed up than men.” Among those who participated in the survey, 54 percent were females, compared to 46 percent males. And of the 1,535 match requests that were not accepted, 52 percent were female and 48 percent were male. 
Datamatch suggested about 26,000 matches for the 4,195 students who participated in the survey this year. Matches had to be sufficiently compatible to be eligible for a free date funded by the Harvard Computer Society and the Undergraduate Council. In total, 3,505 matches were eligible to go on dates; some students were eligible to take multiple Datamatches out.
With 1,016 participants, more members of the Class of 2019 signed up for Datamatch this year than any other class. Seniors were the least represented undergraduates in the survey, with 869 participants.
Fifty-four graduate students and 44 Harvard alumni also registered for the program.
Among the 12 upperclassman houses, students in Adams and Quincy appear most compatible with each other, creating 523 potential matches between the two Houses.  Meanwhile, Cabot and Lowell stood out with the fewest matches, forming only 81 match opportunities together.
The statistics in this article come from an analysis of raw data provided by Datamatch organizers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season full of tough losses, Saturday’s looked to be the capstone.
A night after allowing Columbia to score nearly 1.4 points a possession—the most a Harvard team has given up since 2009—the Crimson defense was folding again. Cornell hit seven threes in the first eight minutes en route to a 27-10 lead, which the Big Red lengthened to 21 with 9:02 to go in regulation. A team that had overwhelmed Harvard in Cambridge was poised to knock the Crimson—longstanding residents in the Ivy League’s penthouse—firmly into the basement.
Harvard’s contest-ending 30-7 run, capped by a game-winning floater from freshman Tommy McCarthy with six seconds left, did not save a season; it brought up a question: What, exactly, are the Crimson to do next year with the rookie?
For much of the season, the answer seemed obvious. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker will face a logjam at his playing position next year with three-year starter Siyani Chambers ’16-’17 poised to return from injury and top-100 recruit Bryce Aiken seemingly a lock for playing time. Throw in prospective seniors Matt Fraschilla and Corbin Miller—who closed out many nonconference games as McCarthy looked on—and it is not clear where McCarthy fits in.
The freshman’s recent play has complicated the narrative. Over the weekend, McCarthy averaged 19 points, four rebounds, and 5.5 assists a game with just six turnovers in 64 minutes of action. He talked after the Columbia game about his increased comfort in Amaker’s system. The stats back up his assertions: McCarthy has scored 16 or more points in four of his last eight contests after doing so just once in the first 18 games.
Yet, the other four contests—where McCarthy scored just 21 points combined—illustrate what has been, at times, a complicated growing process. The man he took over for, Chambers, made stepping in look easy three years ago. In leading Harvard to an impromptu Ivy League title, Chambers averaged about 12 points and six assists a game, shooting 42 percent from three and getting nominated to the All-Ivy first team.
McCarthy, a long shot for any All-Ivy team, has a much more mixed record. His detractors note he’s shooting a horrifically low 27 percent from two and leading his team by a county mile in turnovers. Amaker has grown more talkative about the struggles he and fellow freshman Corey Johnson have faced defending opponents on the perimeter all season—the leaks in an otherwise sturdy defensive starting five. His critics might argue that he’s the fourth best freshman point guard in the conference behind Princeton’s Devin Cannady, Cornell’s Matt Morgan, and Penn’s Jake Silpe.
His supporters would note that he ranks third in the league in assist rate and props up the offense for long stretches with herky-jerky bombs off the dribble and nifty passes in the lane. After struggling to generate chemistry with junior Zena Edosomwan early on—the big man characterized their pick-and-roll play early in the season as “he’s going to throw it up, and I better go get it”—McCarthy has developed a nice partnership with the junior.
His field goal percentage can be directly tied to the team’s lacking of end-of-shot-clock maneuvering, which often involves McCarthy calling for a screen and taking a wild three (to be fair, many go in). Many of the frustrating early-season turnovers from trying to push the ball on the break have dried up; over the last seven games, the rookie is averaging nearly twice as many assists as turnovers.
Moreover, a direct comparison between the freshman years of McCarthy and Chambers ignores key differences amongst the teams. Chambers was able to cede ballhandling duties to future Ivy League Player of the Year Wesley Saunders ’15 and had ace shooters Laurent Rivard ’14 and Christian Webster ’13 to space the floor around him, helping smooth the transition. Chambers’s shooting numbers do not give due credit to a mixed conference season where he made more than half of his shots just four times. With the team on the precipice of clinching a tournament spot, he had just 15 points and 11 turnovers in a road sweep at the hands of the Killer P’s.
While Chambers rebounded, hitting decisive shots down the stretch to deliver Harvard its second-ever outright Ivy League title the next weekend, his freshman year had its share of up and downs. Distressingly, it also represented the senior’s offensive peak—in the two subsequent years, his field goal and three-point shooting percentages dropped every year while his assist-to-turnover ratio roughly plateaued. Due to improved three-point and free-throw shooting, McCarthy actually has nearly the same true shooting percentage as a freshman that Chambers did as a junior.
To suggest McCarthy should be the presumptive starter is heresy—Chambers is a worse shooter but much better defender and, when healthy, the soul of this team. While McCarthy has talked all season about his need to develop into a leader, he does not get the same rave reviews as Chambers for his leadership. Amaker repeatedly referred to Chambers last year as the “team’s most important player,” praising his soul and intensity. His teammates—who made him a captain as a junior—echo their coach’s praises.
However, the gap between the two is not as big as conventional narrative dictates. McCarthy has been an assertive leader from day one—he isn’t reluctant to admit he wants the ball in his hands at the end of games. He’s improved significantly and has the shooting skills to prove useful as an off-ball guard next year if Aiken plays as expected and Amaker stays with the returning senior he began recruiting in eighth grade.
But now, back to the present:
COLUMBIA AT PRINCETON
The biggest Ivy news of the weekend came at Jadwin Arena, where Governor Chris Christie—the GOP’s personal section kid—downed three hot dogs in 20 minutes. Princeton’s league-changing victory—which put it in the driver’s seat with four games to go—was merely a footnote.
The biggest thing separating the Tigers and the playoff is the feisty Lions, who had Princeton on the ropes two weeks ago at home. Columbia was dominant in a home sweep of Harvard and Dartmouth and is 8-0 against the bottom five teams in the conference. It came in a year ago without Alex Rosenberg and nearly beat Princeton behind a hail of Maodo Lo threes. By winning out, it would secure—at the least—a spot in a three-team playoff with Princeton and Yale.
Devin Cannady and co. will end that dream quickly.
Pick: Princeton
CORNELL AT PENN
At least it’s not in Ithaca.
Pick: Penn
HARVARD AT YALE
At least there’s still football.
Pick: Yale
DARTMOUTH AT BROWN
At least … spring break is coming up?
Pick: Dartmouth
CORNELL AT PRINCETON
Cornell profiles as a team that could give Princeton trouble. Unlike most teams in the league, the Big Red won’t be overwhelmed by Princeton’s athleticism and have two players in Morgan and Robert Hatter capable of taking over the game at any point. This is the proverbial “closer than the experts think” game of the weekend.
Pick: Princeton
COLUMBIA AT PENN
A sneaky trap game for the Lions. Penn stayed close with the Lions throughout its loss two weeks ago in New York and played Yale to a near-draw for the first 27 minutes last week at home. Quaker coach Steve Donahue—with the assistance of the first publicized Ivy League analytics staff—has his team playing its best ball in some time. A loss Friday in New Jersey could easily become two here.
Pick: Penn
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
The Ivy League news of the week was Yale senior Jack Montague’s withdrawal from the team for the remainder of the season. Montague was not an expert creator off the dribble a la Makai Mason, but he was a good shooter and steady ballhandler who kept defenses honest and helped a cramped two-big lineup find some breathing room. Yale obviously missed him in its rematch with Princeton and will find itself wishing for him again next week in Morningside Heights.
For now? They’ll be just fine.
Pick: Yale
HARVARD AT BROWN
Ranked a deceptive fifth in the league, Harvard will likely need to either beat Yale on Friday or Yale at home on Saturday to distinguish itself from the rest of the league’s bottom half. However, after showing a tendency to play up to its opponent’s level (BYU, Oklahoma, Providence, Kansas) during nonconference play, Harvard hasn’t yet made a run at the league’s upper echelon. It came as close as you can get to knocking off Columbia at home, but wasn’t particularly close late in its other three contests against the league’s top teams.
What Harvard has shown over the years, however, is an ability to routinely defeat the league’s bottom feeders. It hasn’t lost to Brown since 2009, a streak that should not stop here—even in Cedric Kuakamensah’s final home game.
Pick: Harvard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the last weekend of the 2014-2015 season, it was Dartmouth who stunned the Yale men’s basketball team, forcing a one-game playoff that would determine the Ivy League’s representative in the NCAA tournament. While Yale had controlled its destiny, the Bulldogs’ loss to the Big Green provided Harvard a window that eventually launched the Crimson back into the madness of March.
This year, however, the tables have turned. While Harvard is long out of contention for the Ancient Eight title, it has a chance to make the path to the Big Dance a bit more difficult for the Bulldogs, who currently sit in first place in the Ivy standings, a half-game above Princeton.
But despite the opportunity to play spoiler against their rivals, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker and his players are more focused on proving to their competitors that they are not a team to be overlooked.
“I think even though we’re not still in contention to win the league, we’re still trying to be—like coach always says—a championship team,” freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy said. “We really want to send the seniors out the right way and also try to build for the next four years. [We can use these games] as a stepping stone to keep getting better.”
This weekend, Harvard (11-15, 3-7 Ivy League) hits the road to face Yale (18-6, 9-1) on Friday night, then Brown (7-17, 2-8) less than 24 hours later. The Crimson split contests with the two travel partners earlier this year, besting the Bears, 79-73, before falling to the Bulldogs, 67-55.
The two opponents represent opposite ends of the spectrum, with Yale currently sitting atop the league and Brown tied for last with Cornell. Despite the disparities in records, both teams find their strengths in similar places—at the point guard and forward/center positions. Therefore, much of Harvard’s success this weekend will likely rely on McCarthy and junior forward Zena Edosomwan.
At point guard, McCarthy will face off against Yale sophomore Makai Mason on Friday night and Brown junior Tavon Blackmon on Saturday.
While McCarthy has stepped up his game in recent weeks, including breaking his career-high single-game point total twice last weekend, Mason has been one of the Bulldogs’ most consistent players all year, averaging 15.7 points per game.
“They really put us on our heels a little bit with how quickly they got the ball up and down the floor and attacking in transition,” Amaker said. “Mason, he’s really the catalyst for that. I think he has grown and certainly has developed into one of the better guards, if not players, in our league.”
Meanwhile, Blackmon had a game-high 19 points his last time out against the Crimson, including five points in the final 49 seconds that kept Brown in contention by forcing Harvard to convert free throws, which it has struggled with all year.
In the paint, Edosomwan will face off against Yale senior Justin Sears and Brown senior Cedric Kuakumensah. Edosomwan was just returning from injury the last time he faced these two teams, and his playing time was especially limited against Brown.
Kuakumensah also saw limited playing time due to foul trouble, prompting Amaker to sit Edosomwan as Brown went with a much smaller lineup that required more speed than Edosomwan could contribute.
“We’ll adjust, but we’re very hopeful that we can use Zena quite a lot,” Amaker said. “We’re very hopeful that one, he’s not in foul trouble, and two, that we don’t need to adjust to them by trying to match with them because we’re not playing well. We’re hopeful that we can play our style and play our people and do what we’re capable of doing and then see where it goes.”
While the Crimson was able to limit Kuakumensah earlier this month, Sears was another story. The reigning Ivy Player of the Year had 21 points, seeming to score with ease in the paint. With a style of play that Edosomwan referred to as “unorthodox,” Sears sparked a Bulldog breakout in the first half. In the final 8:04 of the first frame, the senior had 10 points that sent Yale to the locker room with an 11-point lead.
Though Harvard may be out of contention for a title, the team will look to give its seniors one last hurrah in their final road trip.
“Obviously with Yale, it’s a big game—we want to send them off with a win against those guys,” McCarthy said. “These guys are some of the best teammates I’ve ever had—Gunz [Okolie], Evan [Cummins], Pat [Steeves]—so we definitely want to send them off the right way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in four years, the Harvard men’s hockey team’s path to Lake Placid will likely go through Cambridge.
With one point in either of its final two games, the No. 12/12 Crimson (15-8-4, 11-5-4 ECAC) can lock up a first-round bye and home ice in the quarterfinals of the ECAC tournament for the first time since 2012. But before it can return home to the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Harvard will have to travel more than 350 miles north in pursuit of that point.
This weekend, the Crimson heads to North Country to square off against Clarkson and No. 19/- St. Lawrence, two sides battling for different variations of home ice. Currently ranked eighth in the ECAC, Clarkson (16-13-3, 8-9-3) needs one point this weekend to secure home ice for the opening round of the tournament, while St. Lawrence (16-12-4, 10-7-3) looks to maintain its one-point edge over Dartmouth and Rensselaer for fourth place, which comes with a first-round bye and home-ice in the quarterfinals—the same reward Harvard is after.
While the Saints have very little breathing room, the Crimson—three points ahead of St. Lawrence—has a bigger cushion at its disposal. Only Rensselaer has the ability to knock Harvard out of the top four, but to do so, the Engineers would need to win twice, have the Crimson lose twice, and also get help around the league over the course of the weekend.
Yet even with a bit of room for error, Harvard will not be treating this weekend differently from any other, according to junior center Sean Malone.
“At this point in the season, we know we’ve got to be playing our best hockey anyway,” Malone said. “Of course we have to get a point, but at the same time, we’d like to sweep the weekend.”
If the Crimson is to secure a sweep, however, it will have to be without the Buffalo Sabres draft selection, who did not make the trip after injuring himself in a collision with Cornell’s Christian Hilbrich in the third period of last Friday’s home bout with the Big Red.
“I threw a hip-check, and you know, the guy was pretty big,” said Malone, who was seen donning crutches in the stands of the Bright on Saturday’s Senior Night. “He’s about 6’7”. I took kind of a beating there on the side, but our plan is to get me back and ready to go for playoffs coming up.”
If Harvard can clinch a first-round bye this weekend, Malone will have an extra week to recover, as will several other members of the Crimson, including star forward Jimmy Vesey, who acknowledged on Saturday that this is the “point of the year where everyone’s banged up” before laughing off his minor injuries.
“They’re kind of piling up on me a little bit,” Vesey said.
But before Harvard can start thinking ahead, it must prepare for Clarkson, who blew the Crimson out of its own building by a score of 5-1 last month. The upset jump-started an eight-game unbeaten streak for the Golden Knights, elevating them from a conference cellar-dweller to a legitimate contender for a first-round bye in a month’s time.
More recently, Clarkson has fallen back to earth, having dropped three consecutive games. But the Golden Knights are still in prime position to host an opening round series, as they sit three points ahead of Union for eighth place in the conference.
If Clarkson does get a chance to host a playoff series, betting against the Golden Knights in the opening round would be difficult. Clarkson has compiled a 11-2-2 record this year at Cheel Arena, where it will host Harvard on Friday night.
Joining the Golden Knights with 11 victories at home is St. Lawrence, winner of seven of its last eight games overall. With two more wins this weekend—including one over the Crimson on Saturday, the Saints could potentially leapfrog Harvard into third place in the ECAC.
St. Lawrence ranks third in the conference in scoring, one spot behind the Crimson, with just under three goals per game on the year. Harvard topped the Saints, 3-2, in the two teams’ first meeting on Jan. 15, but the Crimson has not won at St. Lawrence’s home, Appleton Arena, since 2010.
The Saints’ home success against the Crimson nearly carried over to the Bright last month, when St. Lawrence held Harvard off the scoreboard for the first 40 minutes. Thanks to three goals in a span of five minutes from Vesey, however, Harvard escaped with a win, prompting Saints coach Greg Carvel to say, “We feel like we lost to Jimmy Vesey—we didn’t lose to Harvard.”
Carvel will have another shot at knocking off Vesey and the Crimson this Saturday, but with playoff seeding on the line, Harvard will be aiming to erase its Appleton demons with points in its regular season finale.
“You never want to go into the postseason on a lull,” junior forward Luke Esposito said. “So if we can get a couple big wins—two tough rinks to play in, two tough opponents—that’d give us some good momentum going forward.”

If you’re a member of the Class of 2017, you’ve probably heard about the Harvard Student Agencies’ One Ring Ceremony. “What’s that, Chris?” I can hear you all asking me. No, no, it’s not just a class ring. Gather around and let me tell you a story…
“Long ago, in Middle Cambridge, Rakesh Khurana was but a happy Hobbit living in the Shire/Quad. Rakesh’s cousin who is somehow 78 years older than he, Bilbo Pfister, had long been in possession of a valuable ring. On Pfister’s eleventy-first birthday, his old friend Gandalf Dingman told him that the ring was incredibly dangerous and persuaded Pfister to leave the ring behind and go party with some elves.
Rakesh hung out in the Shire for a while with the ring, living it up and having open dialogues left and right. Sean Astin was there, too. He provided comic relief. Anyway, Gandalf Dingman came back and told Rakesh and Sean Astin that they needed to GTFO because the ring was putting them in danger. Even though Gandalf sounded like an absolute nutjob and gave them no hard evidence, Rakesh and Sean peaced out. On the road, our heroes met two diminutive Securitas officers that they knew from the Shire and their fellowship grew a little bit.
While on the road, a couple of creeps in hoods started pursuing Rakesh and his buddies, but they ducked into the Kong for shelter. While the two Securitas officers argued about drink sizes (“they come in pints? I’m getting one.”), Viggo Mortensen came out of nowhere. Honestly, the only way to describe his appearance is dusty: pretty hot, but in a shabby, outdoors-y kind of way. Viggo told Rakesh that his crew was making a scene, but he has a heart of gold so he agreed to help them out. He promised to take Rakesh and the ring to Mass Hall where they could convene with President Elrond Faust.
On the way, Rakesh was stabbed by one of the creepy guys in hoods, but Viggo Mortensen used some plant nonsense to fix everything up. When they got to Mass Hall, President Faust told Rakesh and his fellowship that the ring had once belonged to Evelyn Hammonds and that she would stop at nothing to get it back. To save Cambridge, Rakesh had to go to the Science Center and destroy the ring in a cauldron of some chemical that I’m too dumb to understand because I’m an English major. So our heroes set out and… you’ll need to wait for the next film to find out what happened.”
So that’s the story, young ones. The One Ring Ceremony this weekend is actually meant to commemorate Dean Rakesh Khurana’s valiant quest to vanquish evil and definitely NOT to convince nostalgic parents to buy class rings during Junior Parents Weekend for their near-adult children.

With the rising Sophomore Housing Lottery registration opening next Monday, Feb. 29, blocking drama has come in like a wrecking ball. The stress in the environment is visible through the decrease in food supply at Annenberg because of freshmen eating their feelings and the lack of lack of Kleenex packs at the CVS in the Square. Blocking, just like everything else at Harvard ranging from getting into a finals club to exiting Lamont Library, is an unnecessarily complicated and painful process. 
The Leader  Blocking leaders take their blocking responsibilities very seriously. Blocking leaders spend so much time creating and resolving blocking drama, that they consider it one of their extra curricular activities. In fact, you can find their commitment to such position under the “Leadership” section of their resumes.
The Secret SchemerThis silent schemer may come across as the underdog of the blocking hierarchy. He doesn’t complain, or criticize. On rare occasion, you can catch the secret schemer having shady one-on-one talks with a random person that somehow ends up being part of your blocking group.
The Blocking PolygamistBlocking Polygamists have a tendency to drunkenly commit to more than one group and hate confrontation. The blocking polygamist cannot stand all of the drama and just wishes “we could all get along like we used to in middle school and bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles”.
The QuadaphobicQuadophobics’ biggest nightmare is having to live in the quad. Since the beginning of the year, they have tried to convince multiple specialists that Harvard made them suffer from can’t eat–can’t sleep–can’t work–can’t socialize disorder. Whether or not such issues are true, getting accommodations from the AEO is less likely than the PC going coed. The typical Quadophobic has even considered transferring to Yale if things go astray.
The Blocking Fortune TellerThis person tends to hangout around Lamont Café, pretending to be doing a pset. When a scared, innocent freshman passes by they seize the opportunity to analyze and to shower them with blocking myths. The biggest insult you can receive from the classic blocking fortunetellers is “wow, you are so Pfoho” or “ I feel like you are more of a Cabot type”.
