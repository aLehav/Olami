After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On December 27—as both the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama and Israeli elections began to approach—Israel responded to a recent increase in rocket attacks out of Gaza with a series of bombardments on Hamas targets that has now lasted almost two weeks. The Israeli Defense Force followed the bombardments with an incursion into the territory after night fell on Saturday. Most sources now report the death toll in Gaza at around 550  and the United Nations has stated that at least a quarter of these people are civilians. The strikes have been successful in destroying symbols of Hamas’s governance in Gaza and killing at least one major military leader.
The international appeal for a ceasefire on both sides of the conflict must not be ignored. The indiscriminate rocket attacks perpetrated by Hamas have killed several Israeli civilians since the conflict began and amount to little more than criminal terrorist action. Hamas’s method of securing and maintaining power through such violence is illegitimate and appalling. 
Nonetheless, the Israeli response has been inappropriate and short-sighted. The number of Gazan civilians killed far exceeds the death toll in Israel, and Israeli attempts to evacuate civilians in Gaza have proven unsuccessful. The New York Times reported Monday that civilians forced by Israeli soldiers to move to different homes later fell victim to airstrikes in those new buildings.  While Israel can and should defend itself against terrorist attacks, the number of civilian dead is tragic and unwarranted.
With two extremely different political bodies on either side of this conflict, any comparison of proportionality and civilian body count may be irrelevant. Israel cannot and should not wish to be held to the same standards as an organization that defends and establishes itself illegitimately through terrorist action. We expect more of Israel as a legitimate, democratic state. This includes a greater degree of restraint and protection of Gazan civilians in defending itself against Hamas attacks.
Moreover, the Israeli blockade of Gaza that has now lasted more than 18 months  has only worsened the suffering of civilians there. Despite Israeli claims that it is allowing and even aiding humanitarian agencies in the territory, a million Gazans do not have electricity and 250,000 do not have running water as a result of the clash.  Meanwhile, the NGO Save the Children reports a “severe shortage of food” and the World Food Programme’s stores have been rendered inaccessible by the fighting, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has had difficulty getting medical resources to injured or dying civilians.  No matter how the conflict ends, the primary concern should be delivering aid to those who need it.
Regardless of the moral calculus of the clash in Gaza, Israel’s short-term, violent tactic will, in result, counter what should be the ultimate goals for the region: a lasting peace and stability. 
Both Israel’s blockade and its military actions will only serve to galvanize public support for Hamas among residents of Gaza. It is clear that Hamas is willing to both use and exploit the civilians who it purports to represent by operating in civilian areas and intimidating those who act to end violence.  However, Israeli aggression that starves and kills civilians while also cutting them off from basic humanitarian necessities will only increase in a growth in anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas sentiment. In order to achieve real success in those long-term goals, Israel must devise a radically different strategy for countering Hamas’ influence and action.

In today’s editorial, The Crimson Staff makes the valid point that the world ought to hold Israel to a higher standard than Hamas; after all, Israel is a democratic state, whereas Hamas is a terrorist organization that violently seized power over the Gaza Strip by throwing Fatah sympathizers off buildings and killing and imprisoning those who resisted. Thankfully, Israel does hold itself to a higher standard. While Israel attacks military installations, Hamas fires rockets indiscriminately at civilian targets. While Israel attempts to avoid civilian casualties, Hamas stores its weapons under mosques and schools and hides its operatives in hospitals. While Israel lines up trucks filled with humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza, Hamas steals medicine and food from the people for use by its militants. Indeed, Israel ought to be held to a higher standard, but the staff’s argument today ignores the plight of those who have lived under constant rocket fire for the past seven years.
The Crimson Staff now joins many around the world in condemning Israel’s delayed response to seven years of continuous rocket fire from Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Yet, tellingly, this opinion offers no solutions, no alternatives, no suggestions for how a sovereign nation ought to respond when missiles are launched at its citizens. In fact, there were seven years of missiles before Israel’s operation began; 8,250 missiles and mortar rounds had fallen on communities within a 20 kilometer range of Gaza. While some might say that firing 8,250 rockets and mortars at civilians is acceptable “resistance” to the “occupation” of Gaza, almost 2,000 of these rockets were fired in the period between Israel’s complete withdrawal from the territory and Hamas’ takeover. There was no blockade, relatively open borders, and no checkpoints or settlements, and still 2,000 missiles fell on Israeli civilians. 
Israel’s response is criticized as “disproportionate and inappropriate” because so many civilians in Gaza have, sadly, been killed in the operation. What this sort of calculus ignores, however, is the tens of millions of dollars Israel has invested in bomb shelters throughout the south, the early warning system it has installed, and the mass migration of Israelis from their homes to avoid the murderous rain of rockets falling daily from the sky. Civilian deaths are horrible and tragic, but to suggest that death ought to be the only measure of “proportionality” ignores the fact that, for seven years, Israeli civilians have lived under the constant terror of rocket fire.
The attacks on Hamas may lead to more fighting rather than the peace that Israelis, and many Palestinians, long for. While Israel’s choice of attacking Hamas may not have been the best “strategic” decision in the long run, Hamas’s actions have not given Israel the option of a peaceful solution. The staff suggests Israel needs a “radically different strategy” for ending Hamas’ reign of terror, but neither it nor the international community at large has offered any real alternatives to military action against this terrorist group.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I wasn’t always the type to make New Year’s resolutions. Like many others, I’ve been disillusioned by aunts and uncles swearing off things I know they couldn’t possibly live without. Resolutions are tricky things—it’s not easy to find a goal that you can work toward for an entire year that you can also actually achieve. Too many resolutions also prove too abstract to measure, leaving their maker with an unfinished feeling.
Last year, amid all this self-reflection, a resolution hit me which seemed so perfectly substantial, feasible, and important that I knew it was exactly the right kind of challenge.
I resolved in the waning moments of 2007 to become a better listener in 2008. Sure, I wasn’t the worst listener around—I could certainly carry on a coherent conversation. But there were times when I would repeatedly ask the same questions, fail to understand the conclusion of a story, or even bid someone new farewell with the wrong name. And while it may not have cost me any friendships, my simple lack of attention in common verbal circumstances made me feel self-centered too often.
Looking back on this year, I do believe that I became a better listener. Though it might be easier to keep track of quantifiable things like pounds lost or books read, I hope that Harvard’s student body will consider adopting a similar New Year’s resolution for 2009. Here, as anywhere, people tend to get caught up in their own beliefs and concerns, something even more problematic outside of the classroom than in. This resolution does not regard academics; I am not pushing that we all listen to our professors more. It is meant instead for the daily interactions we have with our friends and peers.
In conversation, are you racing to say the next thing, or really listening, processing, and contemplating what someone else says? Research conducted on listening shows that a majority of the time subjects engage in what is called competitive listening—focusing on their own thoughts rather than the words of the person talking. Obviously, being a good listener doesn’t mean stifling your own thoughts entirely, but it does mean giving the people you are listening to the cognitive room for their ideas.
While neurologically this may seem like a Herculean task (we think at about 2000 words a minute, but can only hear 175 words a minute), with patience and practice, we can make more of our thoughts be about the words we hear. Not only will our understanding of the other person improve, but that understanding will lead to better responses on our part. Researchers have devised a slew of strategies for better listening, but the solution doesn’t really come down to asking more follow-up questions or “predicting outcomes.” What better listening does depend on is effort, in slowing down one’s thought process, and allowing others the time to speak. 
While listening to people should be the most fundamental part of this resolution, it should also be about creating audio diversity. Those who listen to their iPod every second traveling to and from somewhere are missing out on precious sounds. The New England wind, for example, especially at this time of year, can create symphonies not available on iTunes. We rarely close our eyes to the bustling, vibrant city we inhabit, but seemingly all the time we close our ears to it. This year, resolve to be a better listener, to your friends and to your world. It won’t be easy, but good resolutions never are.

The military onslaught on Gaza last week has been cripplingly devastating for the 1.5 million Palestinians who live—or lived—there. Already, over 400 Palestinians have died, with over 200 killed on the first day of the offensive—the single bloodiest since 1967. Over 1400 are wounded—the majority of whom are women and children—and receiving inadequate medical attention due, in large part, to the long-term Israeli blockade of the Strip. 
Yet last Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni unabashedly asserted, “There is no humanitarian crisis in the Strip, and therefore there is no need for a humanitarian truce.” That Livni arrived at this conclusion—despite reports from the United Nations, the Red Cross, Amnesty International, Oxfam International and Human Rights Watch—reflects the irreverence with which the Israeli government regards Palestinian lives. Indeed, there is no other explanation. How else could a week of aerial bombing of such a densely populated city and intentionally starving its citizens be justified?
Israel’s defenders say the attacks are a legitimate response to Hamas’ rocket-fire, and a clear case of self-defense. Anyone with a political memory longer than three weeks, however, knows how utterly hollow this statement is in light of the months-long blockade of Gaza. Israeli blockades of fuel, electricity, and food supplies from Gaza, which have been in place for well over a year, have drastically affected homes, businesses and hospitals in a region where 90 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, the most devastating effects of which are seen in the chronic malnutrition of Gazan children. Before the attacks, 60 percent of Gazans received running water once every 5-7 days and less than 30 percent had a reliable source of food, leaving families scavenging for grass to survive. That is not self-defense. It is systematic violence of the highest order, compounded exponentially by the recent military assault on Gaza. 
Though the U.S. and Israeli administrations paint Hamas’ rocket fire as unprovoked acts of terrorism, they fail to acknowledge the tortuous blockade as an underlying—though by no means invisible—cause of Hamas’ attacks. Moreover, American foreign policy has eliminated any possibilities for diplomacy, leaving Hamas with little option, given a starving population locked within the prison-like Strip. The accepted double standards that enable Israel supporters to support such a catastrophic response to one death under the pretense of “self-defense,” yet censure Hamas for using violence to call international attention the slow killing of its 1.5 million citizens, is profoundly troubling. To condemn Hamas without acknowledging that they were elected democratically, that they are the only organization offering tangible social services to the suffering citizens of Gaza, and that they are acting out against a sustained, violent occupation, does nothing to advance the peace process. It is worth remembering that Hamas’ rockets were wildly inefficient, homemade devices incapable of posing a real threat to the world’s fourth-largest military power. While this is not a defense of many of their poor political choices, it further highlights the disproportion of Israel’s so-called “targeted” response.
If the strikes themselves are targeted, as Israeli officials insist, then their targets must have been the houses, schools, mosques, universities, refugee centers, and hospitals that have been decimated in the past week. If not, then Israel had already decided that the entire infrastructure of this already impoverished city was dispensable collateral damage in its hunt for a few Hamas militants. Major newspapers carried the story of five daughters of the Balousha family, who were killed while hiding in a mosque that Israel bombed alongside one of its other targets: the Jabalya refugee center. Ha’aretz writer Amira Hass reported that, despite military intelligence, Israel chose to bomb in the vicinity of elementary schools precisely after children were dismissed, when they would be out in the streets. Whether the murder of children was calculated malice or callous indifference, it exemplifies the abhorrent behavior of Israeli senior officials in this campaign. 
In any case, the widespread destruction certainly was calculated, despite contrary official reports. Not only does Israel commit such crimes against humanity, they announce them brazenly. Last October, Israel’s Northern Command General Gadi Eisenkot said to Ha’aretz reporters: “What happened in the Dahiya quarter in Beirut in 2006 will happen in every village from which Israel is fired upon. We will apply disproportionate force upon it and cause great damage and destruction there… From our standpoint, these are not civilian villages, they are military bases. This is not a recommendation. This is a plan. And it has been approved.” Such an open admission of the intent to inflict maximum damage, no matter the severity of the initial threat, wholly invalidates the popular claim that Israel is targeting only Hamas. According to Eisenkot, anyone within these “civilian villages” becomes a justifiable military target, including young children. Collective punishment is a far too diplomatic term for such a ruthless strategy. Ali Abunimah, a prolific Arab-American author and blogger, perhaps put it best when he asked, is this a taste of the “bigger shoah”  (Hebrew for Holocaust) that Israel’s deputy defense minister threatened?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congratulations, Thomas Vilsack, on your recent appointment as America’s new Secretary of Agriculture. As you leave Harvard’s Institute of Politics this week for your more spacious new quarters on the National Mall, America’s farmers are doubtless foremost on your mind. But the success of your tenure will more likely be judged by its impact on the 98 percent of Americans who don’t farm but do eat—and to serve them your agency needs radical reforms.
When President Lincoln established the United States Department of Agriculture in 1862, he nicknamed it “the People’s Department,” in recognition of the roughly 50 percent of Americans who lived off farming income at the time.
Today, the USDA has become “the Agribusiness Department”: a revolving door for industry lobbyists and subsidized factory farmers bent on weakening food safety regulations. Given that the agency dispensed $91 billion of taxpayer money in 2008, and is nominally responsible for the safety of most food we eat, this should matter to all Americans.
The USDA’s chief ill is its confused mandate: both to promote American agriculture and to regulate it. The agency has done the promotion job only too well: The average American now consumes around 40 pounds of high fructose corn syrup and 227 pounds of meat, fish, and poultry annually—three times the global average.
But the agency has wholly failed in its regulation task and American consumers have paid the price in sickness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that E. coli O157 infects 73,000 people each year, primarily through the consumption of animal-manure tainted meat. And the World Health Organization finds that Salmonella, whose spread is encouraged by close confinement animal operations, infects another 1.4 million Americans annually, killing approximately 580 of them, and costing the nation $3 billion in healthcare costs and lost earnings.
The health impacts of this regulatory void go further. Factory farmers give their animals mountains of antibiotics to spur rapid growth, such that the Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that 70 percent of America’s antibiotics are now used on animals, not humans (the USDA doesn’t even bother recording their use, so no exact figures exist). 
This overuse of antibiotics breeds mutant viral strains that spread to the human population through food, water, and even the air downwind of feedlots. Given that the CDC estimates that two million Americans already contract antibiotic-resistant infections each year—and 90,000 die of them—this is a public health crisis.
So how can you change this, Secretary-designate Vilsack? Your first step should be to appoint impartial officials who will challenge the USDA’s culture of complicity. The current Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, Charles F. Conner, is the former president of the Corn Refiners Association, and the agency’s Chief of Staff is the former chief lobbyist for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. As long as agency jobs serve as sabbaticals for industry lobbyists, the USDA will halt reforms.
Next, you should make enforcement of existing laws a priority. For years, Congress has urged the USDA to publicly report violations of the Humane Slaughter Act. Yet a Government Accountability Office report last year found that the USDA had not only failed to consistently report violations, but had actively falsified its reports. Given that two of the last three undersecretaries for Marketing and Regulatory Programs came straight from jobs at the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association—a group with a clear incentive to hide slaughterhouse violations—this should be cause for concern. 
Finally, you should start to address the distortionary subsidy system at the source of these ills. Artificially cheap grain has helped make it more economical to intensively confine grain-fed animals than to raise them on healthier pastures—a recent Tufts University study pegged the implicit subsidy to factory farmers at $24 per hog.
Yet intensive confinement has also contributed to the public health crisis described above, created huge environmental waste, and reduced animals’ lives to mere cogs in a machine—all negative externalities of factory farming.  And Mr. Vilsack, as you’ll know from sitting in on Ec 10 lectures during your time here at Harvard, taxing negative externalities is a better idea than subsidizing them.
If tackling all this seems like a challenge, Mr. Vilsack, look to the President you’ll be serving. In an October interview with Time Magazine’s Joe Klein, Barack Obama commented on a recent New York Times article by Michael Pollan, the nation’s foremost critic of factory farming. Obama agreed that America’s food system is broken, noting that “our agriculture sector actually is contributing more greenhouse gases than our transportation sector … and [is] partially responsible for the explosion in our healthcare costs.” 
Reforming this broken system will be tough. You’ll need to deliver a tough message to industry: that the UDSA will no longer be a cheerleader for laissez-faire food production, and will instead become a guardian of its safety. And you’ll need to deliver an equally tough message to consumers: that reducing their own demand for artificially cheap, factory-farmed meat will be necessary to stop a public health, environmental, and ethical crisis.
Neither message will be easy to deliver. But leading the People’s Department should be a challenge.

As the Harvard men’s basketball team got ready to face Santa Clara last Friday, it appeared to be in a bit of trouble up front.Hamstrung by multiple injuries and facing a Broncos team with huge 6’11, 275-pound John Bryant and two other players taller than the tallest member of the Crimson, it would have been understandable if Harvard ended up on the short end of things.
But luckily for the Crimson, it was Miller time.
Junior forward Doug Miller stepped up to lead a depleted frontcourt in the best performance in his three years wearing the Harvard uniform. In 26 minutes, the 6’7, 220-pounder scored a career-high 15 points—his first double-digit output in college—on a very efficient 7-of-10 shooting from the field. On the defensive end, he spent much of his time on the floor bodying up big Bryant, limiting his touches and scoring opportunities. The opposing big man scored 14 points, below his 19 points per game average, and the Crimson opened 2009 with a 73-68 victory.
“Doug had a presence that we sorely needed,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You can see the confidence growing in his play. Tonight it was an excellent effort by him. His teammates were so happy for him in the locker room afterwards. He’s a wonderful guy and a great teammate.”
Miller’s performance came on a night when the Crimson had three forwards out injured and a fourth limited. Freshman Andrew Van Nest is out for the season with a shoulder injury and junior Pat Magnarelli has not played this season due to a knee injury—though he may begin a comeback attempt soon. Senior Evan Harris missed his third straight game, while freshman Keith Wright was not near 100 percent physically in his second game back from illness.
So it was up to Miller to carry the flag for the big men inside, and he delivered. With Bryant seemingly holding down the Santa Clara interior, Miller beat him twice in the first half with reverse layups off passes from his classmate, guard Jeremy Lin.
The junior combination continued to shine in the second half, when Miller scored nine of his points. Twice, Lin—who leads the Ivy League in assists and had nine on the day—found his big man down low for buckets to keep the Crimson in control.
“He’s great at finding me,” Miller said. “I just hoped that I could finish and be strong.”
Miller returned the favor, stealing an alley-oop pass attempt to start a fast-break that ended with a three-point play for Lin. Miller’s other basket in the half came as he followed his own miss shot for the put back.
His stellar performance at Santa Clara is a continuation of the great progress Miller has made this season. His freshman season he played in just one game and blew out his knee midway though the campaign. Last year, he averaged only six minutes a game in 23 games and scored just 22 total points all season.
This year, he is one of only two Harvard players along with Lin to start all 13 games and is averaging 4.7 points and 3.2 rebounds per contest.
“He’s a lot better from when he came in freshman year to where he is now,” senior guard Drew Housman said. “He’s probably the hardest worker on the team. It’s great to see him have success, especially against a formidable opponent.”
“He doesn’t take any days off,” Lin added. “He’s definitely taken advantage of the opportunities presented to him this year.”
Miller won’t be taking any days off soon as he and his teammates face Boston College today. The Eagles are coming off an upset win at North Carolina, the then-No. 1 team in the country. But as he battles BC’s frontcourt aces Corey Raji, Joe Trapani, Josh Southern, and Tyler Roche, he can take solace knowing none of them is either 6’11 or 275 lbs.
