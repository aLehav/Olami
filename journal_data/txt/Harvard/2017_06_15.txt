After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a special ceremony held on Sept. 18, 1998, Harvard University conferred an honorary degree upon Nelson Mandela. Addressing the president of the University, Mandela said: “I know that through this award you are not so much recognizing any individual achievement, but are rather paying tribute to the struggles and achievements of the South African people as a whole.”
Harvard wasn’t always so eager to take a stand against apartheid.  In April of 1979, then-president Derek Bok penned an open letter explaining Harvard’s refusal to divest from companies doing business in South Africa.  The letter expressed reluctance to use “the leverage of our purchases, our endowment, and our prestige as a university to push for social and political ends.”
Years of student protest followed, and by 1985 the global divestment movement had gained so much momentum in the Harvard community that The Crimson published a headline: “Every Word Heard is Divestment.” The administration still refused to divest.  The following year, Desmond Tutu stood in the Kennedy School forum and urged Harvard to avoid being on the wrong side of history. “We’re going to be free,” the archbishop said, “and when we get to the other side of this liberation game, we would like to be able to say, ‘You know something, Harvard University was with us.’” After another semester of intense protest, including a student-built shantytown in front of University Hall and the blockading of faculty meetings on Quincy Street, Harvard finally relented.
Today, Harvard has another opportunity to get on the right side of history.  2017 marks the 50th anniversary of the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.  Until recently I, like many Americans, preferred to keep this issue at arm’s length. I was raised in a fairly pro-Israel milieu and would have regarded the use of the term “occupation” in this context as a rhetorical red flag. I largely saw the Palestinian cause as a radical, Molotov cocktail-throwing mess.
Then I visited the West Bank. In Ramallah, I was surprised to find myself dodging not thrown stones, but rather hurried Palestinian businessmen in Italian suits, sprinting off to meetings in glistening new office buildings. Students chatted in posh cafes and bars. There was an Alfa Romeo dealership. Our group of Harvard graduate students met with Palestinian CEOs trying to jumpstart real estate development and an independent telecoms industry. Not exactly the terrorist-riddled ash heap I’d foolishly expected.
But Palestine was a paradox. Alongside this development and apparent normalcy, there was also the stark reality of military occupation.  We passed Israeli soldiers on the roadside pointing M-16s at prostrate Palestinian teenagers. We were harassed by fanatical settlers—the only time we had stones thrown at us. An Israeli soldier told us he wasn’t allowed to enforce the law against settlers—he’d have to call the police to do that—but he could shoot any offending Palestinian with few questions asked. We passed through the innumerable military checkpoints that bedevil the day-to-day errands of Palestinians. Everywhere, The Wall loomed ominously.
Every Palestinian business leader we met with told us how difficult the occupation made it for them to operate. They all had to carry multiple special forms of ID and difficult-to-obtain permits to move freely about the country.  Palestinians have separate ID cards, separate license plates, separate roads.  It is illegal for Palestinian even to be in a car with a yellow Israeli plate.  Israel also applies these rules to US citizens who are ethnically Palestinian.  And this is just the West Bank.  Gaza is a large, open-air prison where the UN reports that the tap water is contaminated and chronic malnutrition is a fact of life.  We were barred from entering.
If this isn’t apartheid, I don’t know what is. I used to find that word radical, but after visiting the West Bank and seeing the reality with my own eyes, it seems like a more than fair description for a half-century of occupation under these conditions. I also came to the realization that the Palestinian cause itself is probably the least radical cause in the world. When you boil it down, most Palestinians are really only asking to be allowed to live in peace on land where their families have been living for generations, not to remake human society in some kind of revolutionary cataclysm.
Harvard should divest from companies supporting the occupation.  Like the South African divestment movement, the Palestinian-led divestment movement spent its first decade or so in the wilderness. But over the past few years, it has begun to gather steam as major organizations like the Presbyterian Church USA have participated. Opponents claim that divestment is anti-Semitic and seeks to destroy Israel. This is a bit hysterical. It’s hard to practically envision how a nonviolent, economic boycott could destroy a state. The charges of anti-Semitism are belied by the young American Jewish movements like Jewish Voice for Peace and the American Jewish academics that support divestment.  It’s time for Harvard to join them.
I want to be clear that I am not attempting to speak for the Palestinian people or the divestment movement, but that I write as a supporter and an ally in an attempt to influence our community, Harvard University, to support their cause. I hope it won’t take our university as long to see the light on this issue as it did with South African divestment.

CHICAGO—According to the GPS, the trip from Detroit to Toronto should take just over four hours, but it has already been over six and my family and I are still stuck in traffic. While my friends jetted off around the country and the world for study abroad experiences and internships, I took off on a family road trip, passing through eight states in the US and a quick trip through the Canadian province of Ontario. Having lived overseas for the past four years, my family decided to take a trip through our own country to visit family and friends.
Driving from one iconic city to another became the norm and stopping at obscure small towns or stumbling upon historical sites a daily occurrence. The funny thing about road trips is that after a while, four hours doesn’t seem like that long of a time and hundreds of miles are no longer a barrier to going to new places.The possible destinations seem endless.
Driving through the country from Florida to Canada, it has been fascinating to see the variety in the culture and the landscape of America. I was shocked to find crosses made of shotgun shells in Nashville and signs for Adult Super Stores which line the highways in Georgia. I didn’t realize that both CNN and Coca-Cola were both founded in Atlanta until we spent a couple days there and visited their headquarters. We stopped at Abraham Lincoln’s birthplace in Kentucky and stopped by Henry Ford’s Greenfield Village in Michigan. I met up with one of my friends from Harvard in Indiana, where he took us on a tour of his small town. In Ann Arbor, I hung out with a friend from high school for a night out at the University of Michigan.  I went to my first graduation party in small town Indiana and then helped with my cousin’s grad party in Michigan.
Before we started this road-trip, I didn’t really know what to expect or who I would see. The cool thing about driving is that you can stop wherever you want and decide exactly where you’re going. We could’ve taken a three hour flight just to visit family, but I never would have seen my friends or the country.
So while it may be frustrating to see our estimated time of arrival get pushed back yet again, it is all part of the adventure. Not to be cliché, but the journey really is the most important part of a road trip.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 14, 2017 at 1:48 p.m.
University President Drew G. Faust will step down in June 2018, ending a decade-long tenure that saw the first woman to lead Harvard navigate headwinds on campus and around the country as she sought to sustain the University’s global stature and conclude the largest capital campaign in higher education history.
In a letter sent to Harvard students, faculty, and staff Wednesday, Faust called 2018 the “right time” for change—her departure will coincide with the end of Harvard’s capital campaign, which has raised more than $8 billion.
“It will be the right time for the transition to Harvard’s next chapter, led by a new president,” Faust said in a statement.
The Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—will create a search committee “in the coming weeks” to select a new president, William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation, wrote in a statement. Lee said in an interview Wednesday that the University is entering the search process “from a position of strength.”
“It’s a position of strength because the institution has made great progress under her leadership,” Lee said. “It has great momentum as a result of her leadership, and there’s a clear vision of where we want to go. “
According to Lee, the Corporation will select members for a committee that will lead the search—which could take as long as a year—for Faust’s successor.
A historian by training who early on faced the worst financial crisis in decades, Faust served over the course of two American presidencies and a rapidly shifting national political climate, expanding both the University’s campus into Allston and its financial aid program.
But her time in Massachusetts Hall was often beset by controversy. Most recently, she came under fire for penalties on members of single-gender social organizations, a policy that a Faculty committee is now considering replacing and that she has repeatedly stood by.
“It has been a privilege beyond words to work with all of you to lead Harvard, in the words of her alma mater, ‘through change and through storm,’” Faust wrote, adding that Harvard has “shared ample portions of both over the last decade.”
‘NOT THE WOMAN PRESIDENT OF HARVARD’ 
After seven years at the helm of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Faust assumed the presidency in 2007 after former University President Lawrence H. Summers resigned amid fervent criticism from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Faust, speaking decisively on the impact of her gender in an exchange with reporters after her confirmation, said: “I'm not the woman president of Harvard. I'm the president of Harvard.”
Faust’s approach to the presidency was, from the outset, a case in contrasts. Some who had criticized Summers for his confrontational style hoped Faust’s approach would be a welcome change, pointing to her experience leading the historically-female Radcliffe Institute.
From her desk in Massachusetts Hall, and often from locations abroad, Faust steered Harvard through years of marked changes with a measured leadership style. Where Summers publicly clashed with professors, Faust quietly enacted her agenda from behind closed doors, rarely making public statements that engendered controversy.
Since Donald Trump’s unexpected ascension to the presidency last year, Faust has also stepped up the University’s lobbying efforts, travelling to Washington, D.C. three times this year to meet with lawmakers and push back on a legislative agenda that could wreak havoc on Harvard’s finances and endanger some of the University’s students.
In 2013 she publicly launched what would become a historic capital campaign. The University had raised $8 billion, setting a higher education fundraising record. The University originally set a target of $6.5 billion.
Still, Faust announces her departure at a time when the University’s finances are on a potentially perilous footing, with lackluster endowment returns—the lowest since the financial crash—and the threat of reductions in federal research funding pressuring Harvard’s budgets.
Faust has also invoked her training as a historian to confront the lingering vestiges of Harvard’s sometimes-troubling past. Although she has warned against erasing the University’s distasteful history from the record, she has led a reshaping of some relics of Harvard’s past, including scrapping the Law School’s seal because of its connection to a slave-owning family and rebranding the College’s House Masters as Faculty Deans.
Still, Faust has taken steps to preserve University history by dedicating a plaque, alongside U.S. Representative John R. Lewis, to four people enslaved on Harvard’s campus in the 18th century. She created a committee to further research the University’s ties to slavery, and held a conference in March to confront those ties.
Her most recent attempt to contend with Harvard’s controversial past came in the form of a school-wide contest to re-write the last line of Harvard’s alma mater, which reads “till the stock of the Puritans die.”
THE ROAD FORWARD
While her predecessor’s reign ended in drama and discontent, Faust’s resignation comes quietly amidst a gap between academic years. Though she has recently been the subject of criticism from faculty members who argue that administrators circumvented the Faculty in drawing up penalties for single gender social organizations, Faust has avoided the public acrimony of Summers era.
When it was Faust’s turn to be vetted for the position, the search process stretched over almost ten months. The nine-member committee that selected Faust was comprised of six members of the Corporation and three from the Board of Overseers. Presidential search committees have maintained the same structure for the past few transitions.
Faust’s search marked the first time students were included in the process through a student advisory committee, Lee said. That body had little authority, though, and other schools—including Princeton and Stanford—have reserved spots for students in their search committees.
Lee said Faust’s departure won’t disrupt the priorities she has outlined over her time in leadership, and in a letter to the community, Faust emphasized “there is much work to be done,” including retaining faculty and staff members and “advancing the work of inclusion and belonging.”
Lee was adamant that the search committee would arrive upon a candidate that embodied the “vision” Faust has shaped in her last decade as president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: June 15, 2017 at 11:05 a.m.
Harvard has raised $8 billion in donations with a year still remaining in its record-shattering capital campaign, continuing its sprint past the public goal of $6.5 billion it set when the drive began in 2013.
Harvard announced the new total Wednesday on the heels of news that University President Drew G. Faust will resign her post when the fundraising drive ends in the 2018 academic year.
While fundraising totals for each of the University’s priorities are not routinely made public, Harvard wrote in a press release that donors have given $907 million to financial aid across its schools; $2.9 billion to its “science Schools and initiatives,” including gifts for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex set to open in Allston in 2020; and $364 million for the arts.
Harvard has received more than 500,000 gifts from 137,000 households spanning 170 countries, according to the press release. The current campaign is the first to involve all of the University’s schools simultaneously, as well as the first to rename schools—including the School of Public Health and SEAS—following nine-figure donations.
Though Harvard has long since surpassed its overall campaign target, there are still “buckets” of unfilled need at the University. The school is still without a donor to name the SEAS complex, and has not met fundraising goals for its House renewal project, which will see many of the campus’s upperclassmen residences renovated.
The University set a higher education fundraising records when the campaign surpassed $6.2 billion in 2016, the total Stanford raised in its last fundraising drive.
As the campaign wanes, Harvard will add another powerhouse fundraiser to its donation apparatus come July when private equity pioneer David Rubenstein—and his extensive Rolodex of business and political contacts—joins the Harvard Corporation.
