After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to the now-notorious incident this past fall—in which both members and pledges of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity publicly chanted offensive and misogynistic phrases on campus—Yale has decided to restrict the fraternity’s activities for five years. Members will not be allowed either to recruit or to conduct any other on-campus activities, and the organization will have limited access to the Yale name. Interestingly enough, however, this was not the university’s initial solution to the problem. In fact, Yale had originally decided to penalize only the students involved, although the nature of the penalties was unclear due to federal privacy laws.
To be sure, the actions of the students involved were reprehensible on many levels, and we need not explain here why the respective chants of “No Means Yes!” and “Yes Means Anal!” have no place on a college campus or in any other space. As comforting as it is to know that disciplinary action has been taken against the fraternity, however, we aren’t sure that the most appropriate decision was made. In our view, the university’s previous decision to impose individual sanctions against the offending students was a more appropriate reaction than the recent decision to suspend the activities of the fraternity as a whole. In other words, by punishing those involved, Yale demonstrated that it holds individual members of its community accountable for their actions. But in suspending the entire fraternity in a very public manner, the university seems more interested in appeasing a bloodthirsty public than it does in dealing with the incident and its perpetrators in the most reasonable, appropriate fashion possible.
Make no mistake: The violation of the federal gender-equity law Title IX, the verbal abuse, and the misogynistic implications of the chants are clear and indisputable. The issue was rightly brought into and kept in the national media spotlight when 16 Yale students filed a Title IX complaint against their university, saying that there had been an “inadequate response” to the issue and that Yale had previously failed to address cases of sexual assault on campus. And although these complaints are certainly valid—as is Yale’s responsibility to address them—the national attention drawn to the complaints alone is insufficient grounds for the university to take action against its entire DKE chapter. In short, whatever actions Yale—or any university—takes in any situation should never depend on the magnitude of a given public reaction. University decisions should instead reflect a fair assessment of the situation by university officials alone, and in this situation, that doesn’t seem to have been the case. As disgusting as the actions of this fraternity may have been, a great American university succumbing to public pressure is cause for concern rather than celebration. In our view, it would have been better had Yale addressed this situation on its own terms, and we hope that this incident will serve as a lesson to all universities across the country.
Then, of course, there are the practical problems with Yale’s new decision. Although well-intentioned, the restriction of DKE will not necessarily prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. Nor will it make the sexual environment at Yale any safer for students, unless the university can institute and enforce broader policies regarding what is appropriate and expected behavior of all. The suspension of DKE activity certainly acts as a foreboding sign for other organizations, but it is by no means a preventative measure that will halt all similar activity in the future. For instance, Yale’s campus environment could remain entirely unaffected by the fact that a single fraternity faces a five-year suspension. To us, at least, it seems that best the way to deal with the threat of sexual harassment on campus is not to compartmentalize the issue but to address it in full. In that sense, putting a temporary end to DKE’s on-campus activity does not offer a permanent solution to the problem.
To that end, the complaints about Yale’s sexual environment lodged earlier this year can only be addressed and corrected by community members themselves. Sexual harassment is a real issue affecting not only Yale but many other college campuses as well, resulting even in the introduction of legislation such as the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act. Across campus at Yale and at other universities, the power to put an end to incidents such as the DKE chanting rests with those who strive to foster environments of openness and respect. Just as individuals must be held accountable for their actions in incidents like these, individuals are also needed to prevent them in the first place.  There is no other way to make our campuses safer for all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has blessed me with a number of gifts: great classes, incredible friends, and even twice-weekly doses of golden nuggets in the dining hall. But these represent just a slice of Harvard’s largesse. In fact, the University gave me its best gift before I even set foot in Thayer 301. Harvard told me to take a year off.
One of those words unique to the Harvard vocabulary, the “Z-list” refers to a group of 50 to 100 students offered deferred admission to the College every year; it comprises a sizable minority of every Harvard class. The Z-list is a funny place to be. You don’t get a fat envelope the day that official decisions come out. You probably accept at another college. You hold onto your spot on the Harvard waitlist, but the swirling news stories about record yields make the possibility of acceptance seem awfully slim. As June rolls around, you make preparations to move to a new city and begin your freshman year—in my case, at the University of Chicago as a member of the Class of 2010.
One day early in June of 2006, I was staple gunning “John Sarbanes for Congress” signs to wooden planks in a hot and dusty campaign office in Baltimore when I got a call from my regional admissions officer, who wanted to discuss the possibility of the Z-list. I accepted.
Many Z-listers emphasize the opportunities for exotic travel afforded by a gap year. But I didn’t travel any more than 50 miles away from my house throughout the entire year. The day I got the call from my admissions officer, I immediately told my campaign manager that I wanted to commit my services for the entire campaign.
That evening, she instructed me to go to Fells Point, an up-and-coming neighborhood on Baltimore’s waterfront, to staff a campaign house party—in other words, to wear a campaign button and a wide smile, while chatting with guests and asking them to sign up to volunteer with the campaign. The party was so stressful, it made me feel physically ill. I was awkward and sweaty and tongue-tied and only 18 years old. Everybody seemed so much older and more sophisticated than I was. The prospect of approaching them felt daunting enough; the idea of asking them to volunteer seemed unthinkable.
But the campaign manager, the spunky and talented Pia Carusone, sent me back to these house parties night after night. And pretty soon, the butterflies and the nervousness went away. The intimidating party goers—interesting, intelligent, and busy people, for sure—were just fellow citizens, and I realized that I had every right to ask them to get involved in the campaign.
For the next 14 months, I got a crash course in the practical challenges of working in politics.  “Call time” became sacred. I bought two suits and learned how to get them dry cleaned. Some volunteers stepped up in inspiring ways and others flaked. I swallowed hard and asked for a job on Capitol Hill after the election.
Working in politics demands a balance of humility and hubris: the former, since politicians are accountable to constituents, and the latter because you need the audacity and self-reliance to shape the future.
Harvard, like politics, requires its students to be both respectful and irreverent. Students need to respect professors and teaching fellows and the decades of work that they have invested in their fields. But students also need the chutzpah to challenge them to get a full education. Students need to respect institutional traditions and structures. But they also need to not always take “no” for an answer when red tape or inertia blocks new ways of thinking.
The education I received in that Baltimore campaign office was as valuable as anything I could have learned in a faraway land. High school does not teach you many of the skills needed to succeed at Harvard. Sure, high school classes may prepare us for Harvard academics, and participation in sports teams and extracurriculars may prepare us for leaderships positions on campus. But at the end of the day, there is no AP exam in mingling, no IB test in asking a Nobel Laureate for an extension, and no SAT section on figuring out the difference between your own dreams and your parents’.
Some people like to discount the classroom education at Harvard, calling it impractical or full of minutiae that is easy to forget as soon as the Blue Books are handed in. I disagree. My education in the practice of politics—both before and during college—has been a central part of my classroom education. And the skills and theories I’ve learned in the classroom compose a key part of the mindset I’ll take to my work after college.
A Harvard education is a four-year adventure filled with incredible opportunities. The Z-list may be a funny place to be, but it makes Harvard an even better place when you finally get here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My most vivid memory of freshman week is sitting at IHOP, sometime after midnight, picking at an overpriced bowl of fruit while the group of other freshmen I had just met ate pancakes. A first college lesson: There is no good reason to order a fruit bowl at IHOP.
Senior week turned out to be similarly educational. Surprising Lesson 1: Friends reluctant to spend $3.40 for round trip T-fare to go into Boston will think it’s a great idea to drop $30 on a ticket to a “Moonlight Cruise” that amounts to circling Boston Harbor in the rain on a three-story boat with several cash bars and not a dinghy in sight. I recognized the quirkiness of my own value system, as buying said ticket seemed much more reasonable—the cruise turned out to be my favorite Senior Week event—than to waste $5.95 on that fruit bowl.
There was a rumor that the price of our tickets covered personalized, embossed life preservers. This wasn’t true. Which leads me to Profound Lesson 2: There’s no such thing as a free life preserver, and if there were, it wouldn’t come with your name stitched in gold thread.
As of press time, I haven’t been raptured. If you’re reading this, I guess you haven’t been either. It’s been nice having Senior Week coincide with the latest apocalypse, which brings to mind several similarities between Senior Week and the End of Days.
Doomsday-related Lesson 3: The moment just before saying goodbye seems like an excellent time to share your secret opinions of people, but it probably isn’t. With respect to the Rapture, telling someone what you really think of him the day before he’s scheduled to be beamed up to heaven has consequences when he—and everyone else—is left behind. Similarly, it’s risky to be unnecessarily frank with your fellow soon-to-be graduates, even those you’ve barely seen since freshman year. Your normal once-a-month head nod routine ramps up to running into each other at every single Senior Week event, now that you’re both trying to squeeze in as much fun as possible before it’s all over.
End Times Analogy Lesson 4: Wild expectations lead to strange economies. In the same way that atheists start post-rapture pet care companies—for Eternal Earth-Bound Pets, 10-year protection costs only $135 with a surcharge of $20 for each additional pet, including llamas and horses in some states—2011-talk morphed into a bizarre electronic bazaar as seniors tried to buy Last Chance Dance tickets for more than double the original price and sell Casino Night Tickets for a 67 percent discount and free delivery. I couldn’t sell mine, and in retrospect, I wonder if offering to return library books in the event of Armageddon could have sweetened the bargain.
Lesson 5: More of a reminder, but my classmates are really talented. I didn’t stop laughing or smiling throughout the entire senior talent show, because I was so, so happy to be so impressed by my classmates. If the people who warned everyone about the Rapture have actually disappeared on Saturday, I bet I would really appreciate them, too.
Most profound of all, Lesson 6: Contemplating change changes ourselves. Senior Week, with its promise of last chances, brings people out of the libraries and explodes with the desperate energy of a thousand pent-up HarvardFML posts. It turns cynics into joyous joiners. The massive advertising campaign—including a billboard in Somerville and vans driving through Harvard Square, advertising the catastrophes that were supposed to begin on Saturday—probably won at least a few converts. Surely it inspired reflection, just like Senior Week socializing compels us to confront our dwindling time together.
Lucky for us, assuming it’s Class Day and the cataclysmic events foretold have not come to pass, we still have a day or two. Enjoy!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When they were 12 or 13, Andrew W. Peace pushed Stephanie M. Cole ’11 off a chair at church camp. (He apologized, he claims.)
Nearly 10 years later, Peace bent down on one knee in front of a lighted Christmas tree at Copley Square in Boston and asked Cole to marry him. (She said yes.)
The couple will wed this September in St. Louis, with Cole’s four roommates­—Amelia H. Lin ’11, Luci Yang ’ll, Eunji Kim ’11, and Chelsea L. Shover ’11—serving as bridesmaids.
The couple had been high school sweethearts and dated long-distance during the first two years of college as Peace attended Ohio University.
“When we were able to work through the long- distance relationship, I realized this is somebody I could spend the rest of my life with,” Peace said.
Their relationship was strengthened by their complementary personalities, their mutual interest in helping others, and their shared commitment to their United Methodist faith.
He is spontaneous, she is organized; he is an EMT, she founded a branch of a non-profit that combats childhood malnutrition. Pressed to think of something annoying her fiancé does, Cole could only say that he sometimes calls too often.
“They’re well matched in that they’re both extremely giving people,” Lin said.
After sophomore year, Peace moved to Boston to complete an EMT training program at Northeastern University. Together, they have been active in the Boston church they attend and in the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship.
Given the length of their relationship, their compatibility, and their purchase of an engagement ring last April, Cole said she was eager for Peace to formally propose.
“I told him that if he didn’t propose by Christmas, I was going to propose to him in an embarrassing public way,” she said.
Immediately after the wedding, the couple will move to Mali to work for Project Peanut Butter, a non-governmental organization that aims to treat malnutrition in African children. Cole, an Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrator with a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy, has worked with the founder of Project Peanut Butter throughout college. She added she and her fiancé see the work as their “Christian mission commitment.”
Cole’s roommates said they admire the two’s commitment to one another and to their work.
“They hold service to others in such high regard that they’re willing to devote their lives to it,” Lin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Texas natives Baltazar “Zar” A. Zavala ’11 and Melanie Johns first became friends in gym class during their freshman year of high school. Johns spent weeks sitting out the class due to a broken ankle, and Zavala would ask her to hold his locker key, gently teasing her about her cast.
That June, before the start of sophomore year, Zavala and Johns began dating. They will marry on June 23 of this year—their seventh anniversary—back home in El Paso, Texas.
When Zavala left for the East Coast to attend Harvard, the transition to a long-distance relationship proved to be difficult for the couple.With Johns working as a full-time ballet instructor at two schools and Zavala as a student and varsity football player, opportunities to visit—and even time to talk on the phone—were scarce.
“Freshman fall was miserable,” Zavala said. “Adjusting to college in general­—with football and with the season being as long as it was—that was definitely the hardest point in our relationship.”
“But it got easier every year,” he added.
Despite the distance, their busy schedules, the long flights, and the all-too-brief stays, Zavala and Johns remained devoted to each other.
Zavala had been unhappy about a particularly low midterm score when Johns visited him during one of the darker periods of his sophomore year. Zavala was in poor spirits during the couple’s visit to the New England Aquarium, and Johns sat him down for a pep talk on a bench in front of a 7-Eleven outside of the aquarium.
“Mel grabbed me and sat me down on a bench and said I needed to man up, that one test was not a big deal,” Zavala said.
He never forgot that night, and a year later he proposed to Johns on that very bench.
After the wedding, the pair plans to relocate to England, where Zavala will study at Oxford University on a Rhodes scholarship and Johns hopes to continue teaching dance.
Despite their impending international move, the pair emphasized their hope to eventually settle in their Texas hometown.
“We both love El Paso,” Johns said. “I can see us settling down and raising a family in El Paso—not immediately, but I can see it in the future.”

When the sign-holding mascot appeared on the video board at a Texas Rangers game in the summer of 2007, Victoria G. Mendoza ’11 thought that maybe she had inadvertently become part of an inter-inning joke. But it turned out that her boyfriend, Billy K. Crawford, was indeed asking her to marry him­—and she said yes.
They wed on Aug. 6, 2010 at the Plantation House outside Austin, Texas. Hana K. Ali ’11, Ana Garcia ’11, Miyoko T. Pettit ’11, and Cecilia Venegas ’11 were bridesmaids, and Tsion M. Aberra ’11 sang during the ceremony.
Mendoza wore an organza and tulle dress made by her mother, and the guests dined on Texas barbecue and homemade cakes. At the end of the evening, the guests lined a pathway with sparklers as the couple left for a honeymoon in Mexico.
Crawford said that he viewed his proposal to Mendoza as a way of “reaffirming that we really would make it work.”
They had already been making it work for a while. Crawford­ had previously dated Mendoza’s best friend, but he and Mendoza became a couple during the summer after her sophomore and his junior year in high school. He began attending a college near her hometown so they could stay together.
When Mendoza, a History and Literature concentrator with a secondary in Ethnic Studies, enrolled at Harvard, Crawford followed her to Boston to attend Northeastern University for a year before transferring back to school in Texas. According to Pettit, Crawford then intentionally graduated early in order to return to Boston—where he is now an NFL agent—to live near Mendoza.
Mendoza said that getting married during college was “a relationship decision” that did not change what she wants to do with the rest of her life. Next year, she and her husband will relocate to San Antonio, Texas, where she will teach middle school through Teach for America. Mendoza, who was active in Phillips Brooks House tutoring programs and the advocacy group Act on a DREAM, said she has always been interested in immigration and education issues.
“They’re always like a young couple on a great honeymoon … but when I’m with them, I never feel like a third wheel,” said Pettit, Mendoza’s freshman year roommate. “That’s the kind of love they have—a really great friendship.”
“Billy was what I was looking for; we get along really well,” Mendoza said. “I could see myself with him for the long term.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a full moon the night Horia Mihail “Mike” H. N. Teodorescu ’11 proposed to Debbie P. Lin ’11.
The couple was in Vienna, Austria this January Term after visiting Teodorescu’s family in Romania. He kept the ring on him, waiting until he came across a place that felt right. At the Hofburg Palace, he found it.
As the couple explored the palace grounds, Teodorescu spotted an elegant courtyard, complete with a statue in a fountain. That night, after attending a concert, he and Lin wandered through the city until they found themselves back in the courtyard. “It’s dark,” Lin recalled. “He’s pointing up at the statue and saying something like, ‘That’s Fortuna, right?’ And I say, ‘I don’t know, I don’t have a classical education.’”
Teodorescu then took out and opened a small box equipped with its own light—he had anticipated that the proposal would take place at night. “I wanted to make sure the ring could be emphasized,” he said. He dropped on one knee to propose, and she accepted.
At the time this article went to press, the couple expressed plans to marry on May 23, 2011—two days before Class Day—at Memorial Church in a ceremony officiated by University Chaplain Dorothy A. Austin, with the reception to follow at the Faculty Club. Lin said the cake would be crowned with a topper she made herself: a polymer clay sculpture featuring “kitty” and “panda” figurines as the bride and groom, reflecting the couple’s pet names for each other.
The Currier House residents became friends as sophomores when their paths crossed frequently during late-night visits to brain break. “We met in Currier dining hall because of our ‘unique’ work schedules,” Teodorescu said. “It’s probably hard to find someone else awake at five in the morning working on p-sets.” The friendship evolved into what he called a “Currier love story” during their junior year.
“He says junior fall because he was trying to make his intentions known then, but I was clueless,” Lin said. During the J-Term that followed, Teodorescu spent hundreds of dollars calling her from Europe.
Eventually, Lin said, she got the point, and the couple officially began dating in February 2010. As their relationship developed, Lin said she slowly realized Teodorescu was someone she wanted to marry. “It was nice knowing there was someone I could trust so completely,” she said. “He knows everything about me.”
Teodorescu plans to work as a software engineer at Microsoft, and Lin plans to enroll at Harvard Medical School in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Elizabeth C. Spira ’11 chose to write her senior thesis on Army wives, the Sociology concentrator already knew her research would have real-life applications. On July 2, when she weds her fiancé, West Point cadet Theodore A. Hoham, Spira will become an Army wife herself.
When the pair attended high school together, Spira had a crush on Hoham­—and Hoham on Spira’s best friend. It was only after graduation that Spira and Hoham began dating. They stayed together through freshman year of college and broke up for much of sophomore year. When they reunited near the end of that year, they discussed getting engaged.
Hoham kept putting it off, saying he couldn’t afford a ring yet. When she called one day to chastise him for buying an Xbox instead, Spira didn’t know that he had already bought the ring—a gold band with rubies and a diamond—or that he had her on speakerphone. His roommates were listening, quietly laughing as the ring sat in a box on his desk.
So Spira was surprised when Hoham proposed in January 2010. She had been accompanying him at West Point’s 500th Night, to celebrate 500 nights until graduation, when the couple went up to West Point’s six-story library to take a picture after the banquet. A friend began playing the piano.
“I was thinking, this would be such a cool place to be proposed to,” Spira said. “And everybody gets in this little half circle, and Ted gets down on one knee and proposes.”
“I wanted to share that moment with my buddies,” Hoham said of his plan, which, like much in their relationship, involved an elaborate plan secret to no one but Spira. He is keeping the location of their honeymoon a secret to her, but will tell anyone else who asks—including all of her blockmates, his friends, strangers, and the author of this article.
Spira estimated that a third or fourth of the West Point graduating class is betrothed. West Point cadets are not allowed to get married during their four years at the academy, and many couples reserve the chapel on graduation day for half-hour ceremonies following graduation and commission.
“My mom would kill me if we did that,” Hoham laughed. Instead, the couple will marry in Fort Wayne, Ind. at the church where Spira’s father is a pastor. A few days after the wedding, Hoham, who is part of the 101st Airborne Division, will travel to Georgia for a month of training. The couple will reunite for their honeymoon and then move to a base in Fort Campbell, Ky.
Spira, who completed the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program at Harvard, will look for a job teaching middle or high school while Hoham awaits deployment.
Hoham described Spira as strong-willed, sweet, and caring. “I think she’s capable of doing the Army thing,” he said. “It definitely takes the right person.”

Charles E. Shannon ’11 and A. Faith Kniffley are well versed in the laws of chemistry—and physics and biology and calculus.
The couple met at (MS)squared, a math and science summer program for minority students held at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where she was the 16-year-old girl who spent all her time with a popular clique of five girls, and he was the “goofy” 15-year-old guy who always showed up late to their tennis class.
The two did not interact much during their first summer at camp, but he decided to call her that fall on Sept. 25, according to Kniffley, who remembers the couple’s important dates with precision. A discussion about Usher’s new CD, “Confessions,” led to an instant friendship and frequent telephone chats.
After nine months of talking, the couple first saw each other in person again when they returned to camp the next summer. They became a couple, much to the surprise of their fellow campers, who had no idea the two had become so close.
That October, she went to visit him in Memphis, his hometown, which Shannon said marked the start of their long-distance relationship. The following fall, she began attending the University of Louisville, and he headed north to Harvard a year later.
“I really wanted it to work out, so when we started we would always look forward to the next time we would meet,” Shannon said. “The plan was always about how are we going to see each other next, whether it was one of us hopping on a Greyhound or flying back from Harvard.”
The couple briefly parted ways a few times, once when Kniffley first went to college—“he was under this impression that I was going to meet some guy,” she said—and again during Shannon’s freshman year at Harvard, as he struggled to adapt to the Harvard workload. But each time, they reconnected.
Kniffley spent her senior fall semester at Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Mass. to give the couple the opportunity to see if their long-distance relationship could also work in person.
“We just needed time to be together,” Shannon said. “And we were like, ‘This works!’”
And after graduating last year, Kniffley relocated to Boston, where she is working in a first grade classroom with City Year.
On May 1, Shannon took Kniffley back to Andover, Mass. While Kniffley had dreamed of getting engaged where the couple had first met, they had visited Andover last fall with no proposal. Shannon threw her further off the trail by having his younger brother, Christopher A. Shannon ’13, suggest the trip (though the brother backed out at the last minute).
After eating lunch and wandering around the campus, they made their way to the spot outside of a dorm where they had shared their first kiss. A very nervous Shannon dropped to his knee and pulled out a Tiffany ring box, to the excitement of Kniffley, who recalled, “It was exactly what I wanted.” Fittingly, they ran into their program director from (MS)squared just minutes after getting engaged.
They plan to wed in Louisville, Ky. in the spring or summer of 2012. Next year, both Shannon and Kniffley will be working with Teach for America; he will teach sixth and seventh grade math, and she will teach science. Ironic, they pointed out, as they met studying science and math.
“That’s our story, start to finish,” Shannon said.
“No,” Kniffley said, “start to beginning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took all her willpower to refrain from opening the love letter before she was allowed to.
Daniel C. Suo ’10, the outgoing president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, had given his successor and friend, Lisa M. Yu ’11, a note to read on her morning flight home for January Term 2010, several weeks after they attended multiple formals together. Yu opened the letter on the plane shortly before take-off.
“I started grinning like an idiot,” she said. “It was just about how he couldn’t stop thinking about me after Winthrop formal … He essentially ended it with ‘All I really want for Christmas is you.’”
The two began dating shortly thereafter. They plan to be married on Aug, 18, 2012.
Yu first met Suo briefly during her Prefrosh Weekend when she attended an event for CSA.
After Yu joined the organization during the winter of her freshman year, she and Suo started working together extensively, although their personal relationship did not develop until after Suo stepped down as president at the end of the fall 2009 semester.“We went to a few formals together, and I was very set on making things happen, so I did,” Suo said.
He decided to propose this past winter. After meeting Yu’s parents over winter break, he said he felt the time was right. He first considered a public proposal at the CSA banquet, but decided “sentimental was probably better than a big flashy show.”
The weekend before this Valentine’s Day, Suo, who works at Goldman Sachs in New York, came to visit Yu in Cambridge. The couple had dinner at Yenching in Harvard Square and then took a walk to Suo’s parents’ former home at 20 Ware St., behind Pennypacker.
“He took me to that apartment and said, ‘This is where my parents started their married life and I started my life, and we can start our life together,’”  Yu said.
In September, Yu will be moving in with Suo in New York and working at McKinsey.Given their time-intensive careers, they have hired a wedding coordinator and plan to keep things “simple and elegant, and not too pretentious,”  Yu said.
Suo said the progression of their relationship has felt very natural. “What I love the most about our relationship is just the simplicity of it, it’s never felt tiring, it’s never been complex,” Suo said. “I’ve been in plenty of relationships, but it’s the first for both of us where communication came first and came very easily.”
“We make decisions in a similar way. Even when we disagree, we can work it out without getting too emotional or upset,” Yu said. “It just feels really right.”

In the following pages, The Crimson compiled the stories of five recent Harvard graduates who exited the gates of Harvard Yard to go on to pursue a diverse range of occupations and opportunities. The writers were asked to briefly reflect on their year (or years) since graduation and to respond to the fears and anxieties that the Class of 2011 may be experiencing as they soon face postgraduate life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is a part of the 2011 Senior Section's Moving On Into the Real World series. 
And do you cook Korean food for yourself quite often?” my friend Lotte asked in her inquisitive British cadence.
The batter was sizzling, and I had no idea where to find a spatula. I didn’t want her to think that my quickly burning appetizers, Korean pancakes filled with spicy pickled cabbage, were teetering on the edge of disaster.
“Uh, yeah!” I lied. “I cook Korean food, like, all the time.”
So maybe I wasn’t necessarily the expert chef I’d made myself out to be when I had volunteered to cook for a few friends from my Masters program at Cambridge. Maybe I had never really concocted a large and complicated meal for anyone.
But I had grown tired of cooking and eating alone in my small cinderblock bedroom, tired of living with the problem my Harvard friends and I had discussed too frequently in the months since graduation: chronic loneliness.
Harvard students spend their evenings chatting with roommates in common rooms, gossiping with classmates over coffee at Lamont Café, and whining with fellow brain break frequenters while smearing cream cheese onto bagels at 3 in the morning.
Harvard alums, though, often spend their nights in great and seemingly perpetual solitude. Bankers eat takeout alone at their desks, political campaigners microwave solitary meals in hotel rooms along the Interstate, and graduate students forage for coupons and cheap sustenance.
Over Skype, one of my friends working in New York told me that she had started holding dinner parties for friends on weeknights to fill the silence of her gorgeous but empty Upper East Side apartment. She encouraged me to do the same.
“Not only will you save money, but you’ll also make new friends and feel better about yourself,” she said, sounding a bit like a late-night infomercial for diet pills or expensive workout equipment.
A sucker for that sort of thing, I decided to give it a try.
As I searched the Internet for recipes and browsed the aisles of the supermarket, it was nice to feel as though I was accomplishing something. Graduate programs tend to have so little structure. If you don’t find small projects to start and finish beneath the shadow of a distant yet looming dissertation, you might go a little crazy.
“What about flipping them with this fork?” my friend Kevin asked as the smell of almost-burnt batter began to waft from the pan.
It was going to have to work. Nervous, I stuck the utensil under the sizzling blob and counted to three.
Moments later, the pancake sizzled—and I smiled. There, in a kitchen in England surrounded by friends who had never heard of Domna, of Board Plus, or of Adams’ inhumane dining hall restrictions, I had flipped a pancake to the other side and felt—for the first time in my postgraduate life—really, truly happy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is a part of the 2011 Senior Section's Moving On Into the Real World series. 
It’s Saturday night. Lady Gaga croons over a pounding dance beat. The heat emanating from the mass of gyrating bodies in the center of the room is near stifling, unabated by half-open windows at its perimeter. The floor is sticky with what one only hopes are spilled screwdrivers.
A girl approaches. Rosy from drink, the music visibly coursing through her veins, she makes eye contact and says, “I’ve never seen you here before, are you a senior?”
“No, I actually graduated last year,” you hear yourself say.
Her mouth falls. The happy bemusement in her eyes turns first into confusion, and then into disgust. The music stops and the shame starts. It’s 1:34 a.m. and you, a Harvard graduate with the world supposedly at your feet, are in a dorm room, macking on sweaty freshmen.
The nightmare described above first began to haunt me the moment I stepped through Johnston Gate as an alumnus. It had many incarnations: it happened in Cabot, in Kirkland, at Yardfest, or even, in its darkest form, in freshmen dorms, but the core elements were always the same—pop music, sweaty dorm room, and inevitable shame. It acted as an invisible force, keeping me far from campus, though from my post-grad pad I could see the Mather Towers. I didn’t want to be “that guy,” the recent graduate who still partied regularly with undergrads in a desperate attempt to recapture his college glory because it was the only glory he would ever achieve.
This vision affected me so, because when I was graduating, I couldn’t shake the feeling that my best years were behind me. As commencement drew closer, the phrase “the best years of my life were in college” evoked an increasing amount of dread. I had to believe that there was life beyond Harvard full of parties, friends, debauchery—everything that had made my undergraduate years special. I needed to believe I hadn’t peaked, that my best years were not behind me, that I wouldn’t become “that guy.”
And I didn’t become “that guy.” And surprisingly, it wasn’t very difficult. Life after Harvard is full of amazing new experiences—swanky charity dinners, club parties, trips to see friends in far-flung locales—and some that feel familiar (read: sweaty apartment parties). And though it may not seem like it now, on the eve of Commencement, your life after Harvard can be as vibrant and fun as it was at Harvard.
So now my dorm-room nightmare comes less frequently as I grow more confident that my best years are yet to come. There is an abundant supply of pounding dance music, steamy rooms, and sticky floors ahead, and I hope you will join me in making the most of it. Congratulations Harvard Class of 2011­—welcome to the big kid party.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is a part of the 2011 Senior Section's Moving On Into the Real World series. 
For the past nine months, I’ve been sleeping on an IKEA mattress folded in half. My feet hang off the edge. I’ve been sharing one room with two other women and a large snake, whose cage doubles as our coffee table.
Rent is cheap. This is one of the three pillars of my journalism career. The other two are Twitter and the fact that I can stay on my parents’ health insurance until I’m 26.
It’s interesting to work in an industry that’s having an ongoing debate over whether anyone will actually pay for the stuff we make. I’m not saying this facetiously: being part of a group of hyper-articulate people who are losing their business model and trying to find a new one is fascinating.
But it also means that I, like many of the young journalists I know, exist in a halfway world of stipends and fellowships, where it’s no longer shocking to be a 25-year-old intern. (I will be a 25-year-old intern.)
It’s an exciting world, full of startups and big questions and fights about the nature of information. But it’s strange, too. You get professional cred for understanding Facebook. There are newsrooms flailing in their attempts to master the Internet, and newsrooms owned by AOL.
The best introduction to all of this is Twitter, the journalist hangout that never closes. Don’t listen to Bill Keller. Twitter has been my journalism school: the place where I’ve found mentors, debated theory and practice, figured out what I need to learn. Spend some time there. Make friends. If you want to be a journalist, you need to develop your own opinions about who, in the future, will pay you to write, or visualize data, or code.
People will tell you to network, to “build you own personal brand,” and they’re not wrong. This may get you a job.
But if you’re interested in journalism because you want to be a writer, you need to play a different game. Nobody can help you. Writing is about you and the page, about how far you can go in your relationship with language. The friends I have who will make it as writers are the ones who have full-time jobs and write on top of that.
They don’t expect to earn money. They just do it.
When I was in college, I worried a lot. I thought if I didn’t become the best little reporter in the world, I wouldn’t make it in this business. But it turns out all you really need is stubborness. If you stick around long enough, you’ll have a career—and I don’t mean on a content farm. If you budget, and make some compromises, you can live by writing stories you care about. It’s pretty amazing. And the compromising isn’t so bad. My roommate’s snake, for instance, is lovely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is a part of the 2011 Senior Section's Moving On Into the Real World series. 
As storm clouds roll across the sky, I gesture wildly at the front of my classroom, mimicking the smooth rise and fall of a Gaussian curve with my flailing arms. It’s always a struggle to hold the attention of 17-year-olds, and the southern storm now fast approaching behind the school is proving to be a great distraction from the otherwise fascinating topic that is exponential and logarithmic functions.
One student looks out the window and interrupts me to announce, “I straight hope this tornado picks this school up, carries us away, and drops us right in the middle of New York City.”
Sometimes I want to admit I hope that for him too. For a young man raised in a town of about 1,500 people whose poverty rate is twice that of Arkansas, a town where 60 percent of all children live below the poverty line, opportunities to leave of one’s volition are beyond scarce. It is the anti-American pastoral.
I’m not a teacher because of an ascetic pleasure gleaned from some high and mighty “call of duty” BS that can be packed and sold to college seniors suffering from Ivy League guilt. At the end of the day, I teach for purely selfish reasons: I like kids, I like being on my feet, and I like having a job that lets me wave my arms in logarithmic growth patterns. The fact that my students are low-income is not my daily dose of self-righteousness. It’s my daily reminder of the systemic injustice that I too often feel powerless against.
I had visited the Arkansas Delta before signing on for two years of service, but I was nevertheless susceptible to the culture shock of moving to a very low-income, rural area.
What has made my experience different from a corps member in an urban region is that rural poverty rarely comes in pockets, but in swaths hundreds of miles wide. I don’t spend my days in a high-need school and my nights enjoying the comforts of a more affluent city neighborhood. Like my students, I shop exclusively at Walmart and the Family Dollar.
It’s a far cry from the lifestyle I imagined I’d have after graduating from Harvard—but unlike my students, I can pack up and leave at any moment. The chains of extreme poverty don’t fetter me to this land of inopportunity. In fact, I will soon be Dorothy’d out of the Delta to teach at an expanding charter school in Brooklyn this fall. And I wish I could take 77 high school students into the tornado with me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This column is a part of the 2011 Senior Section's Moving On Into the Real World series. 
In the year that has passed since I turned in the key to my Adams House suite, I have lived in three different states, driven across the country one and a half times, racked up several thousand frequent flier miles, and slept nearly as many nights on an air mattress as I have in a normal bed.
Many of my classmates graduated to pursue stable career paths or more degrees, but I left Harvard with my sights set on the campaign trail—a fast-paced environment with an uncertain future and an objective with a hard deadline.
After graduation, I packed up my meager belongings and drove halfway across the country, not knowing where I would live or what my life would look like after the campaign ended.
Yet campaign life proved to be oddly familiar—much like a the night before a final, I subsisted on little sleep and nothing but pizza and black coffee, trying to accomplish a day’s worth of tasks in half as much time.
But unlike college assignments, there are no extensions on a campaign, no room for negotiating a final grade. When I woke up the morning after Election Day, the outcome was clear—and then it was over. So I packed up my office, deflated my air mattress, and went back on the road.
I spent the first month of my post-campaign life out of a small suitcase and in friends’ guest rooms, traveling to six different cities as I used the newfound free time that the end of a campaign had handed me.
And after a month of nomadic living, I found myself back in my car, headed toward the promise of a more stable life in our nation’s capital. Armed with a stack of singles and a bag of change, I set forth on Midwestern roads, where my stops at tollbooths nearly outnumbered the cups of coffee consumed over my two-day drive.
I’ve since settled into life on the Hill. I’ve signed a lease and hesitantly decorated my apartment with Craigslist furniture. I now own a real bed and eat pizza only a few times a month (though I still drink far too much coffee). I’d like to think that this life is close to normal—but after the past year, and with another campaign always in sight, I’ve come to realize that normal is always open to interpretation.

The percentage of Harvard seniors who plan on joining the workforce after graduation remained steady at two-thirds for the Class of 2011, according to The Harvard Crimson’s fifth annual senior survey.
The figure marks a significant drop from 2007, when 73.2 percent of graduates had accepted job offers by Commencement day.
Education surpassed finance and consulting this year as the most popular sector among respondents entering the workforce, with 11.4 percent choosing to enter the field—likely reflecting the success of programs such as Teach for America, which recruits aggressively on campus and reported in March that 18 percent of this year’s class had applied to its two-year teaching program.
The percentage of seniors surveyed entering finance and consulting fell from 47 percent in 2007 to a low of 20 percent in 2009, when Wall Street firms slashed hiring in the midst of the financial crisis. The share of this year’s seniors entering these sectors was similar to 2009 levels, with 11.2 percent entering consulting and 10.5 percent entering the financial sector.
The percentage of seniors heading to graduate school held steady from last year at a quarter of the class, with a combined 14 percent attending medical school or graduate programs for the sciences.
As in previous years, Harvard seniors entering the top employment sectors reported that they would choose another field if salary were not a concern. Half the students planning to work in finance or consulting said they would have chosen different fields. A career in the arts was the most popular dream job, with 15.7 percent of seniors indicating their interest. Public service and health services were also popular choices if financial concerns were not a factor.
More than 20 percent of seniors, excluding those not entering the workforce, will be making under $30,000 next year, and roughly another 20 percent will be earning between $30,000 and $49,000. The remaining 30 percent will bring in more than $50,000. The median base salary for those entering finance and consulting is between $70,000 and $89,000, and the median income for those entering the technology sector is between $50,000 and $69,000.
New York beat out Boston as the post-graduate destination of choice for Harvard seniors, drawing 23.1 percent of the class. Boston will keep 19.4 percent of the Class of 2011, falling from 24.4 percent of seniors last year. About a tenth of the class will be heading to California, and nearly 7 percent will move to Washington, D.C. Around 19 percent of seniors will be moving outside the United States next year.
The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2011 was conducted through a secure website that ensured only one response per senior. More than 500 members of the Class of 2011 responded to the survey between May 13 and May 18, 2011. The survey has a margin of error of +/- 4 percent at the 95 percent confidence level.

Rather than focusing on their country’s upcoming presidential elections, Egyptians should create a political system that distributes authority instead of concentrating it in one individual, said Mona Mowafi, a graduate student in the Harvard School of Public Health, at an event held at MIT last night.
“I personally believe that making the presidential debate a primary focus at this time, while sexier, brings about the false hope that one individual will be elected and bring in reforms and be the savior of the Egyptian people,” Mowafi said. “While I do agree that having an inspirational and transformational leader will be crucial in building a new stage for a new Egypt, the reality of the democratic transformation will require mass involvement by the people in order to come to fruition.”
Mowafi spoke alongside Wael Ghonim, an Egyptian activist who helped organize protests in Cairo during the revolution.
Ghonim was the recipient of the 2011 John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his efforts in this spring’s revolution in Egypt that overthrew the government of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
Instead of focusing on political leaders, Ghonim said that ordinary Egyptians, both in Egypt and abroad, must take responsibility for the fate of their country.
“We are all in the drivers seat,” Ghonim said. “It’s up to us to decide, ‘Do we want [the revolution] to go forward?”
But Ghonim warned that creating a democratic political system will not be easy and that Egyptians must be patient during the process.
“People will have to make choices,” Ghonim said. “Sometimes these choices will be wrong ones and they’re going to learn and go through the experiences. Four years from now they will be more empowered and more able to make better decisions.”
While Egypt is currently going through a period of intense transition, Ghonim challenged the audience to take up the cause of the Egyptian people and try to make a tangible difference in the development of the revolution, even if they are thousands of miles away.
“You need to go out of this room now and before you sleep decide what you want to do and just start doing it,” Ghonim said.
Event attendees said that they thought that Ghonim’s perspective was critical for people evaluating the situation in Egypt and the role that they can play.
“Being worlds away, you get bits and pieces, but it’s totally different to hear the perspective of someone who’s been there on the ground,” said Suzan El-Rayess, a graduate student at Columbia University.
El-Rayess added that the current unrest in the Arab world provides an opportunity for students to more directly learn about the evolution of political systems.
“You can throw the IR books out the window and become a student of the world,” she said.

Researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Design recently launched a cross-disciplinary study of the Persian Gulf region to aid future sustainable urbanism in the area when various economies shed their dependence on gas and oil revenue.
The region’s importance in the world fossil fuel market renders it a crucial place to examine sustainable development, according to the researchers.
“If the Arab region consumes its plentiful resources in a way that makes life not sustainable, then it will not be good for the entire world,” said Design School Professor Spiro N. Pollalis, principal investigator for the project.
Nations in the Gulf region are currently building cities based on European and American models, but they are unsuitable for the particular locale, according to the project’s senior research associate Nader Ardalan, who initiated the study.
The project will study development in the region. The researchers are currently examining the first phase, which is defined from the earliest prehistory—when humans started building settlements in the region—up to the advent of oil income, which enabled the region to discard their traditional patterns and build new cities in the 1950s and 1960s.
“The [Arab states] have realized that the way they are growing is unsustainable,” Pollalis said. “This is where they called Harvard University to simply help them.”
The researchers believe that the project can be replicated in other parts of the world since the methodology—examining history, environment, economics, public health, and development through the lens of architecture and urban design—could be applicable elsewhere.
“This does not impact just the Gulf region,” Pollalis said. “By having the sensitivity and sensibility to look at these resources, [our project] offers services to the world in an area that is really crucial.”
The project will result in the creation and circulation of an encyclopedia called the “Gulf Encyclopedia for Sustainable Urbanism,” which will make the research findings widely accessible.
“These are challenging issues for the Middle East,” said Harvard School of Public Health Professor John D. Spengler, a co-investigator of the project. “[Fortunately] we have a wonderful pool of multi-disciplinary experts working on this.”

Partners HealthCare Inc., the non-profit company that owns several Harvard teaching hospitals, announced earlier this month that it had quintupled its second quarter operating income from the same period last year.
The company posted a $71 million operating income for the second quarter of FY 2011, representing a massive increase from its $13 million operating income in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Operating income is measured by activities related to the company’s core purpose—in this case, healthcare delivery. The increase in  income resulted from greater research revenue and higher usage of medical treatments involving expensive and complex care.
Partners Vice President for Finance Peter K. Markell said in a statement that a focus on cost reduction has also lead to continued profits.
“We will continue to improve the value we provide our patients as we slow the rate of our cost increases to make care more affordable,” Markell said.
According to the Boston Globe, overall revenue increased by about $200 million from second quarter of FY 2010 to FY2011, jumping from $1.9 billion in 2010 to $2.1 billion in 2011.
Partners also saw a spike in second quarter non-operating income—the profit the company makes through investments and activities unrelated to its core purpose—from just $9 million in FY2010 to $95 million in FY2011. The Globe cited “the strong rebound of the health care company’s investments in financial markets” as the root cause of the increase.
Partners HealthCare Inc. was founded in 1994 as a joint venture by two Harvard teaching hospitals, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. As a non-profit company, Partners now owns several hospitals in Mass., and is the largest healthcare provider in the state. Originally intended as a merger between the two founding hospitals in order to lower overall operating costs, Partners has been criticized in the past for prompting an increase in the cost of healthcare in Massachusetts.
According to a 2008 article in the Boston Globe, Partners cut a controversial deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield, the largest health insurance provider in Massachusetts, in order to raise rates.

Women who do not hit the gym are twice as likely to have difficulty achieving orgasm than those who enjoy exercising, and students attending colleges with higher tuition show greater desire for sex than those attending schools with a less expensive price tag.
These findings—and much more data from the dating website OkCupid—are posted on the company’s blog, OkTrends.
OkTrends started in July 2009 as a forum to present interesting data the free dating website has collected from its users, said Christian T. Rudder ’97-98, editorial director and data analyst for OkCupid.
“We have a unique window into the way people are living their lives,” Rudder said. “We thought other people might be interested in what we found.”
The blog is updated about every six weeks, or “when we feel like we have something interesting to say,” the blog reads.
Its 23 posts have analyzed the ways people of different races interact with each other in the cyber world, how members of each gender perceive and rate the profile pictures of the opposite gender, as well as OkCupid users’ general online dating behavior.
“Dating is such an idiosyncratic thing,” Rudder said. “We present an analytic approach—just unbiased data.”
For example, the blog features a chart showing the correlation between women’s preference for exercising and difficulty having an orgasm by crossing the match questions, “Do you like to exercise?” and “Is it difficult for you to have an orgasm?” The same post also analyzes college tuition and the number of times a week the students would like to have sex.
“Generally speaking, the more your parents are paying for your education, the more horny you are,” Rudder writes in the blog.
Some other findings include that beer lovers are 60 percent more likely to be okay with sleeping with someone they have just met; white, Asian, and Hispanic women prefer white men to all other races; and some of the biggest lies people tell in the online dating world are about their height and income.
Rudder, who has written most of the blog posts, was an English concentrator before switching to mathematics at the end of his junior year. He said his Harvard education has helped him manage the blog.
“The blog is about writing and analytics. It makes a good pair of skills,” Rudder said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Alumni Association, in conjunction with the Harvard Office of Public Affairs and Communications, has released an application for web-enabled smartphones to help College alumni navigate this week’s reunion events.
The free “Harvard Reunions” tool allows users to browse the reunion schedule, check-in at events on campus, network with fellow classmates, share reunion photos, view the campus map, and receive real-time announcements from the HAA.
“We want this mobile event-management application to enhance annual reunion events that are run by the Harvard Alumni Association,” said HAA Deputy Executive Director Philip Lovejoy. “We designed this app to help reunion attendees re-engage with the campus and re-connect with classmates.”
The application is also integrated with popular social networking services such as Twitter and Facebook, which will allow alumni to communicate more freely with peers and the HAA.
Perry S. Hewitt ’87-88, Director of Digital Communications and Communications Services at Harvard, stated that the app “has a huge opportunity to transform [the alumni’s] experiences and enhance the offline world.”
The development of the tool, which occurred between January and April, was supported by University President Drew G. Faust in a move that Hewitt said “has driven home the importance of innovating.”
Hewitt added that the app is built on an open source framework, thus allowing others to develop similar modules.
HAA advertised the tool over class mailing lists and at reunion registration, where staffers walked attendees through the process of installing and using the app. The HAA intends to use analytics to measure both the quantitative and qualitative success of the app.
Lovejoy said the majority of the feedback on the app has been positive, citing as an example a Twitter post from Prital S. Kadakia ’06, in which Kadakia stated that he was “even impressed here in silicon valley.”
Shelley Mandelbaum, whose husband was a member of the class of 1961, said the program was “wonderful.”
“You’re not alone when you have an app,” she added.
Lee F. Donaghey ’61, an avid iPhone app user, experienced some trouble accessing the Harvard network and downloading the program on his iPod touch. Despite his difficulties, he said he was “delighted with the invention and the history of this technology.”
“It is a privilege to be alive to see this in existence,” said Eugene B. Rosenberg ’61. “It blows me away. I wish I were graduating this year so that I could have 50 more years to play with [the app].”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: May 24, 2011
An earlier version of the May 24 news article "Class of 1961 Uses ‘Harvard Reunions’ App" incorrectly implied that the app was only for iPads and iPhones. In fact, the app will work on any web-enabled smartphone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge Police Department will start visibly cracking down on seat belt usage, according to a statement released by the department yesterday morning.
In a cooperative nation-wide effort conducted in conjunction with the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security’s Highway Safety Division, the state police, and about 190 other local police departments, the CPD will launch a high-visibility seat belt enforcement “blitz” called “Click It Or Ticket.”
Current Massachusetts law states that a driver can only be charged with a seat belt violation if they are stopped for a possible traffic violation.
The increased enforcement will run from May 23 through June 5—during the same time as Harvard Commencement ceremonies and many class reunions.
“Too many people still believe that a crash will never happen to them,” said Robert C. Haas, Cambridge police commissioner in the released statement.
The crackdown—during which officers will be checking if drivers and passengers are wearing their seat belts—marks the first state-wide seat belt program this year, aimed at increasing seat belt use and decreasing motor vehicle deaths and injuries.
In order to motion an increase in attention to the issue, the police departments have enacted a zero tolerance policy for seat belt violations.
“Unfortunately these tragedies can and do happen every day, and the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is by wearing your seat belt and making sure that everyone in the vehicle with you wears their seat belt as well,” Haas said.
Fifty-two percent of the passengers killed in motor vehicle crashes in Massachusetts during 2009 were not wearing their seat belts during the crash, the Department of Transportation’s National Highway Safety Administration reported. This amount was 3 percent higher than the national average.
“A lot of people shrug off the statistics because they see themselves as good drivers,” said Deputy Stephen A. Ahern, commanding officer of the Cambridge Police Traffic Unit, in the released statement. “They forget that they can still be hurt by other reckless drivers and that their best defense against injury is to buckle up.”
The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security’s mission is to reduce fatalities, injuries and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle crashes in Massachusetts, according to their website.
The mobilization was made possible through a federal grant form the Highway Safety Department along with the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security’s Highway Safety Division and other partners.
“No more excuses,” the release said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a solid rookie campaign in which she tallied four goals and nine assists, sophomore defender Josephine Pucci of the Harvard women’s hockey team attended a different kind of summer school, opting to stay in Cambridge to work on her game during the summer months.
“Freshman year, I learned so much about college hockey from the coaches, the team, and our strength coach,” Pucci said. “I did what I could to build off of that and stayed at Harvard over the summer. That helped me become a more conditioned athlete and a physically stronger player.”
Her decision to focus on training proved to be effective. Pucci had a breakout season this winter, earning a spot as a finalist for the ECAC Best Defensive Defenseman Award and leading all Crimson defenders with 25 points on 12 goals and 13 assists, including two game-winners against Union and St. Lawrence, respectively.
“For [Pucci], it’s all about a big confidence boost,” said tri-captain forward Kate Buesser. “She’s become more confident, and it’s been noticeable on the ice.”
Pucci notched her first assist of the year in Harvard’s opening game, hitting senior forward Kathryn Chute on a power-play advantage for the score. Three games into the season, Pucci scored a goal of her own in a 4-2 win over Brown.
She helped anchor a defense that gave up an average of 1.95 conference goals per game and boasted a .908 save percentage.
“[Pucci] was definitely one of the reasons why we did so well this season,” tri-captain Liza Ryabkina said. “She stepped up not only defensively but she was an overall force on the ice.”
During Pucci’s sophomore campaign, Harvard scored 97 goals and won an impressive 14 ECAC games.
Though Harvard was ranked as high as No. 5 in the nation during Pucci’s rookie campaign, her increased presence on the ice made a big difference in the team’s play this season.
“It’s important to use the summer as an opportunity to grow...in any way we can,” Pucci said. “Preparing off the ice and coming back here and having good time [is essential.]”
Pucci earned a nod to the All-Ivy first team and the All-ECAC second team after her performance this season. The sophomore also earned recognition as an honoree of the New England Hockey Writers Division I All-Star team.
“Her work ethic sets her apart,” Buesser said. “She’s in the gym all the time and always putting in the effort. She’s one of our best defensemen and is really reliable, whether shutting down someone on defense or, offensively, giving a team a lift with a nice pass or play.”
“I want to do the best I can and improve in any way I can,” Pucci said. “Hopefully that will help the team get better. Any time an individual gets better, it helps the team, keeping us moving forward and continuing to improve. We want to keep moving and building.”
National team coaches are also beginning to notice Pucci’s work ethic, as the sophomore was selected to represent Team USA at the IIHF World Championships.
Coached by none other than Harvard’s Katey Stone, Team USA captured gold in overtime against Canada, 3-2.
“Playing at the World Championships was an unbelievable experience,” Pucci said. “We beat Canada in overtime in the finals, and I learned so much.”
“Playing at that high level pushes you in every way possible, mentally and physically,” she continued. “It was a great challenge to have the opportunity to experience.”
Time spent playing in the World Championships had other, less obvious benefits for Pucci, as Crimson hockey alums Caitlin Cahow ’08, Angela Ruggiero ’02, and Julie Chu ’07 earned the world title alongside her as teammates in Switzerland.
“I was able to play for coach Stone again up there and play with some older Harvard alums,” Pucci said. “Coming through the Harvard program, having heard stories about them, and then actually getting to know them and playing with them was an amazing experience.”

A group of students in Chinese Bb have made a humorous homage to their class and teachers for their final project. The video, titled "Hāfó Huanying Ni (Harvard Welcomes You)," is based on the song "Beijing Welcomes You," which was made for the 2008 Olympics.
The video, made by Sean M. Bennett '14, Samuel S. Brinton '14 and Aticus A. Peterson '14, is entirely in Chinese with Chinese subtitles and discusses their class and its teachers. Even if you don't speak Chinese, you can still appreciate the catchy tune and recognize the numerous Harvard landmarks throughout the video. Those familiar with Chinese propaganda will get a chuckle out of the pseudo-heroic poses made at various points in the song.
The original song is memorable for its inspirational tone and the fact that it was played non-stop in China. It even features the musical stylings of Jackie Chan when the chorus kicks in.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
Last week Yale University suspended its chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, nearly two months  after the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights launched an  investigation into the claim that Yale's sexual  harassment policies violated Title IX regulations. The school says that  DKE—whose notable alumni include George W. Bush and George H. W.  Bush—violated its policies by, among other things, making its pledges  chant phrases like "No means yes, yes means anal." Until its suspension  is lifted, DKE is no longer allowed to hold chapter meetings on campus  or recruit new members.
After a week of voting, students at DePaul University voted to keep Sabra-brand hummus on the menu despite allegations that Sabra's parent company—Strauss Group—gives money to Israeli military units accused of human rights violations. DePaul's Student Government Association put the snack's status up to student referendum, asking students if they preferred to replace Sabra with "an alternative brand of humus." This vote represents the first referendum that SGA has held on an issue in over 10 years.
Someone needs a spellchecker. When printing its programs for its upcoming Commencement ceremony, Georgetown University failed to check the accuracy of its own name, spelling it: Georgetown Univeristy.
Students at the University of Chicago recently received a letter encouraging them to "refrain from masturbating in the shower." According to the letter, an excess of semen—which is not soluble in water—has been clogging shower drains, resulting in thousands of dollars worth of repairs. The school acknowledge that students need to "take care of your business," but advised that they do so "in the comfort of their own rooms, and to dispose of [their] discharges appropriately." The letter was, in fact, a hoax.
A black bear was spotted on Princeton University's campus last week, prompting the school to send a letter to students warning them of the animal's presence. According the email, the bear did not present a threat, but the email warned not to feed the animal.
