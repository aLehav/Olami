 « Mais qu’est-ce donc, ce vie? »
 
In English, “But what is it then, this life?”—these sensitive words of a young Marie-Antoinette are a far cry from the callous “Let them eat cake!” that historians say posterity has incorrectly attributed to her. So much of our fascination has been with the reputation, not the person, of this infamous queen. But the play “Marie-Antoinette, In Her Own Words,” which ran until Oct. 20 at the Modern Theatre, attempted to give us just the real person. From a script by French historian Évelyne Lever based on the diary entries and letters of the queen, director Katherine Adamov cast the celebrated French actress Barbara Schulz as the title role. Though it lacks some traditional theatrical elements, which makes it feel incomplete as a dramatic presentation, the play does succeed in filling its primarily educational goals by delivering an engaging, multifaceted portrait of a woman that pop culture has too often trivialized.
 
The most commendable virtues of the play were its characterization of the queen and its conceptual simplicity. It is a one-act play with no changes in scenery, only one actress speaking French with English supertitles, and a few occasional sounds from the background to signal shifts in chronology. The play begins in the Conciergerie Prison in October 1793. At left there is a bed with a wooden icon of Christ; next to that is a writing table with chair, and then at far right near the edge of the stage another chair. Thirty-seven-year-old Marie, sentenced to the guillotine and writing to her sister for the last time, begins having a prolonged series of flashbacks that spans her whole life from the time of her arranged marriage at age 14 to her ruin and imprisonment. Then at the end of the play, the sound of a gate opening calls her back to the present, and she leaves prepared for her execution.
 
This simplicity is a welcome directorial move on Adamov’s part, because it is precisely the opposite of what most people expect from a play about Marie-Antoinette—we envision the glamour of the rococo rooms, the elegant elevator-hair, and extravagant court life. But, as the play suggests, none of that courtly fluff was the real Marie anyway. “I prefer the company of a few nice people rather than all this court that flatters me,” Marie declared at one point in the play. Rather, the spirit of the real Marie, the “Widow Capet” as Marie was called following her husband’s execution, sat for years in a dank cell writing to her loved ones and praying as a devout Catholic for the forgiveness of all her sins. Hence, in this play, Schulz’s hair is arranged in a simple braided bun of white hair. Schulz herself is quite convincingly clad in only an ordinary woman’s black dress and shift.
 
The play was helpfully directed in its course by occasional strains of distant courtly music that brought a smile to Schulz’s face, sound effects of bells ominously tolling outside the prison to occasionally wake her from her reveries, and various changes in lighting orchestrated by Chris Fournier—growing brighter when she slipped into memories of the past, and fading out when she returns again to the last hours of her life.
 
However, Schulz’s performance had mixed success. Most of the time the characterization was artfully done, with Schulz proving her character to be an energetic and intelligent young woman, an anxious daughter wishing to please a cold mother, a good wife and tender mother, and later a dignified, politically astute woman. But while she succeeded in expressing these roles of the young, pre-imprisonment Marie, Schulz was less convincing as the Widow Capet. Her tone of voice underwent no change between conveying the younger and older Maries, and instead sounded high-pitched and youthful throughout.
 
Likewise, the decision of Schulz to weep and bewail her bad fortunes, as she does while portraying young and old Marie alike, is unrealistic. While the real Widow Capet was said to seem greatly aged and grown old prematurely, Schulz ultimately does not portray an imprisoned Marie that is sufficiently changed or matured from the Marie of the court life. The result is that Schulz’s Marie Antoinette feels completely a victim of history and a poor intelligent woman, but not the dignified Widow Capet.
 
Overall it was a performance that succeeded as much as a theatrical piece whose primary goal is educational can expect to. The design of the play, with its incorporation of the historical Marie through flashbacks “in her own words,” creates a more compelling view of the real woman. But its commitment to such historical fidelity confined the play to logistical constraints. Furthermore, a lack of character development in the actress’s performance prevented it from being a fully rewarding dramatic experience

The idea of a 130-year old operetta may seem tiresome, but director Allen J. Macleod ’14 promises that Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ “The Pirates of Penzance,” which opened yesterday and will run through Nov. 10 at Agassiz Theater, is ridiculous fun. With its parody of stereotypes and human nature, Macleod says, this century-old tale is anything but out-of-date.
“It’s a balance between big group numbers, witty dialogue, patter songs—which are fast and funny—beautiful ballads, and a couple of dance numbers,” Macleod says.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s unconventional coming-of-age musical follows the journey of the overly dutiful Frederic (Alexander J. Raun ’17) as he turns 21 and is caught between his servitude to the pirates who have raised him and his moral compass, which rejects their brutish ways. “It’s a story about Frederic’s conflicted nature,” Raun says. As in many traditional musicals, love complicates Frederic’s journey as he falls for a beautiful young maiden, Mabel (Allison A. Ray ’14).
“I wanted to go very classic with this,” Macleod says of his take on “Pirates.” But classic does not make the show unrelatable to the modern audience.
“There is the occasional archaic reference, but for the most part it’s a very accessible comedy,” says Amelia H. Ross ’14, who plays Frederic’s nursemaid. “I think the best analogy I can make is it’s like a late 19th-century ‘Lonely Island,’ in a way, very satirical with a lot of social commentary.”
Not only does “Pirates of Penzance” promise to be a relatable operetta, but Macleod describes it as full of fun and hijinks.
“It’s such a funny show!” Raun says, agreeing with Macleod. “I laugh about it to myself all the time.”
Ross even admits to letting a few laughs slip out onstage. “Normally I pride myself on not having a tough time with that, but there are some moments that are so good that I’m losing it onstage.... I know any audience member would get a kick out of it.”

Though the costumes and customs of Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s “Julius Caesar,” which opened yesterday and will run until tomorrow evening at the Loeb Ex, give the show a modern feel, these are not the only aspects that make the classic so applicable—the dialogue, which dates back hundreds of years, grapples with moral and social themes still prevalent today.
“It’s a play about trying to be a good person and a good politician,” director Alice Abracen ’15 says. The plot follows Marcus Brutus as he is lured into a conspiracy against Julius Caesar. Shakespeare’s tragedy questions violence in the name of justice and democracy itself, questions that Abracen says are especially relatable to Harvard students. “A lot of us feel very ambitious and will at some point be drawn to politics or at least leadership positions, and this is a play about what it takes to be a good leader.”
Unlike most productions of “Julius Caesar,” the politicians and leaders in Abracen’s rendition are not all men—Cassius (Lelaina E. Vogel ’15), the manipulative mover-and-shaker of the conspirators, is a woman.
“We believe that women can wield power just as effectively as men,” producer Alice F. Berenson ’16 says. This casting choice leads to commentary on the modern woman and raises the possibility of unrequited love between the now female Cassius and male Brutus.
“There is a lot of insinuation of some sort of relationship in the original Shakespearean verse between Cassius and Brutus, and since I [am] female, we decided to take that to a new height,” Vogel says. Though she would not go so far as to call Cassius a “seductress,” Vogel points out that modern women encounter gender conflicts in trying to attain power. “[Cassius] uses a lot more sexual energy to get her way, as, unfortunately, many women in politics have found themselves obliged to do,” Vogel says.
With its contemporary themes and newly explored undertones of love, Abracen’s “Julius Caesar” challenges the classic text by examining the script in depth and considering its modern-day questions.

In zero-gravity space warfare, having a dynamic perspective is the only way to survive. Since its publication 28 years ago, “Ender’s Game” has received acclaim for author Orson Scott Card’s innovative imagination of space and complicated condemnation of violence. The novel is as action-packed as it is cerebral, and in his movie adaptation, director Gavin Hood proves his ability: “Ender’s Game” loses neither its awe-inducing creativity nor its difficult questions of morality in its translation to the big screen.
  The film closely follows the book’s plot—smartly and to great effect, for the fan base is ardent enough and the story simple enough. In the not-too-distant future, humanity wages a war against the Formics, or “buggers,” an insectoid alien race whose attempts to colonize Earth end in spectacular, if mysterious, defeat. Yet the politicians in charge of the overcrowded world are certain that the Formics will return for a second attack. They form the International Fleet and a Battle School to train new leaders, who are culled from the ranks of the world’s most intellectually gifted children. Raised on video games and constantly evaluated through implanted neck monitors, this is a pre-programmed world without privacy, perhaps for good reason. When we first meet Ender (Asa Butterfield), he is a precocious beanstalk of a boy whose intellect, rather than brawn, has caught the attention of the International Fleet. Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) whisks him away to Battle School, far from his concerned parents, diabolical brother, and sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin).
  On Earth, the film is nothing new: chemistry beakers and sibling rivalry denote a well-known world. But Battle School, a claustrophobic torus rotating around the planet, is a highly believable foray into futuristic boot camp. In this stark world of fluorescents and metals, Ender’s education really begins. The film is solidly anchored by a young teenage cast, necessary by dint of plot but not always successful. In moments of anger and fear, Ender and his comrades are frighteningly adult-like, forced to deal with emotions and stressors far beyond their years. The infrequent lighthearted scenes are more of a challenge, full of contrived conviviality. This may, however, have been an intentional directorial decision on Hood’s part: deprived of a childhood, these adolescent warriors know no world except one of unceasing training. Butterfield proves the perfect actor to shoulder Ender’s emotional burdens. “There is so much to learn and so very little sleep,” he writes tiredly to his beloved sister. His shaky, underdeveloped frame wordlessly voices the central moral dichotomy of the film. He is, in every sense, a child soldier.
  Yet he is also the thinking boy’s superhero, able to outwit opponents through his lightning-fast mind and fierce survival instincts. He lathers his skin with soap to give himself an upper hand in a violent bathroom brawl, and he plays dead in the battle training room and confounds his enemies. Butterfield’s steady intensity and ability to conveniently emulate  lachrymosity make him the perfect Ender. Bolstered by Ford, Hailee Steinfeld as fellow trainee Petra, and Ben Kingsley’s late appearance as war hero Mazer Rackham, “Ender’s Game” does not lack for strong actors.
  It is not the adequate acting, however, that makes “Ender’s Game” a worthy adaptation. Rather, it is Hood’s treatment of Card’s grand juxtaposition of simulation and reality. The Battle Room, rather than Card’s description of a centrally located room, instead juts into space, a glass-walled polyhedron overlooking Earth and the infinity beyond. Swooping, vertigo-inducing shots play with perception in the same way that Ender himself does—he is the only Battle School student to quickly realize that there is no up or down in space, and to manipulate this loophole to tactical advantage. Hood’s camerawork complements this mindset well, swooping upside-down and right side-up. Characters appear to enter a scene sideways, only to orient themselves to the gravity of the room; they move upwards, or is it sideways, or is it down? Though the film’s dialogue occasionally grows clunky as Ender must audibly sort through mental processes that in the book occur in his mind alone, Hood spares the audience some of the tediousness by using the camera as an extension of Ender’s mind.
  This lifelike consciousness does not extend to every aspect of the film. Coming so soon after “Gravity,” “Ender’s Game” almost begs comparison to that paragon of hyper-realistic science fiction. Rather than adhering to a strictly realistic presentation of space, Hood instead crafts an intentionally pixelated universe. The effect will never be the same as “Gravity,” but then again, the two films’ only true similarity is their space setting.“Ender’s Game” is as much a movie about simulation and the morality of deceit as it is a venue for green-screen animation. Ender’s mind-controlled video game and immersive command room do not need to be realistic. Their existence, in the world of the film, is the melding of mind and machine. “What happens when it’s no longer a game?” Ender worriedly inquires. Though the film may, by necessity of time constraints, excise certain subplots and shortchange character development, it does not fail to explore Card’s seminal moral indictments. When reality can only be experienced from behind a screen, perhaps it is a reality that the people of “Ender’s Game” should never have entered.

There is nothing intrinsically shocking in Abdellatif Kechiche’s “Blue is the Warmest Colour.” There are introductions, conversations, arguments. There are dinner parties, chance encounters, sexual trysts. In short, things that happen to everyone. What’s shocking is that these things all appear on screen. Most unprecedented are the lengthy, explicit sex scenes, but the entire film is surprising in its commitment to naturalism and ordinary life. Its steadfast realism is not quite revolutionary, but “Blue is the Warmest Colour” is still a deeply affecting film, bolstered by excellent performances and, somewhat improbably, its three-hour running time.
When “Blue” won the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the jury awarded the prize not only to Kechiche, but to the film’s two stars, Léa Seydoux and Adèle Exarchopoulos. Both do stunning work, but special credit is due to Exarchopoulos, who plays Adèle, the young woman at the heart of the film—it’s not for nothing that the French title is “La Vie d’Adèle - Chapitres 1 & 2” or “The Life of Adèle - Chapters 1 & 2.” Adèle is a high schooler without guile or direction. She’s a smart girl, but dislikes how her teachers force her to overanalyze her favorite books. Only when she falls in love with the older, cooler, and more liberated Emma (Seydoux) does she gain some direction in life—or, more accurately, something that seems like direction. “Blue” is emphatically not the story of a love affair; rather, it’s the story of a young woman who has a love affair.
As such, the movie depends a great deal on Exarchopoulos’s performance. Artlessness is not easy to act—doing so is nearly a contradiction in terms—but Exarchopoulos excels as a girl who totally lacks affect or guile. Though Kechiche could have played this for laughs—a scene in a lesbian bar is rife with comic possibility—he’s far more fair to the character. The scene in the bar instead sparkles with awe and mystery, charged with Adèle’s thrill of entering a world unknown. Emma is a different beast: she’s rebellious, artistic, and comes from wealth. Seydoux gives her a vivacious, immediately attractive spirit—you’re reminded of why Owen Wilson was so taken with her in “Midnight in Paris.” Both actors imbue their characters with real depth, but what really establishes Emma and Adèle is the sheer length of the film. At 179 minutes, “Blue” has a running time worthy of most epic films; instead of filling those three hours with a labyrinthine plot, however, Kechiche extends his scenes until they have the rhythm of real life.
When Adèle and Emma converse, exposition is nowhere to be found—the dialogue is startlingly naturalistic. Even minor characters get great lines, best seen in a scene late in the film, when Adèle and Emma host a dinner party. There are many notable characters in this lengthy setpiece, the most memorable being an actor who gets work in American films because he speaks Arabic—“They like the jihad thing,” he explains. The film itself has the feel of a great conversation—it rushes by in the moment, but contains an astonishing amount of information.
Kechiche’s devotion to realism, however, does not prevent him from developing a distinct and effective style. Much of “Blue” is shot in tight close-ups, creating a tense style heightened by the almost total lack of non-diegetic sound. When Kechiche uses a shot that includes a character’s body in full, the sense of relief is nearly palpable. The great French director Éric Rohmer decried the close-up, claiming it separated the actor from his environment. But that may very well be Kechiche’s goal—“Blue” is more or less a film exclusively focused on its two heroines, and when the camera hones in on one of their marvelously expressive faces, the effect is mesmerizing. Why bother showing the world when Exarchopoulos’s face already does so?
“Blue” is not flawless—despite all the virtues of its length, it does drag a bit at the end—and its already notorious sex scenes will keep the prudish from attending. Those who do see “Blue,” however, will be rewarded with a sprawling, ambitious, and wholly satisfying piece of work. Kechiche has, in the end, provided us with an epic—an epic centered around normal life, perhaps, but with tremendous emotional power.

Well, October is over, and so are the first two months of the school year. November’s arrival means one thing: time really flies when you’re buried in work and hopped up on caffeine. Here are some things that definitely feel longer than the last two months have:
1. The amount of time Miley Cyrus’s tongue has spent out of her mouth.
2. Explaining the premise of “Breaking Bad” to your grandparents.
3. “Runner Runner,” the film flop starring Ben Affleck and Justin Timberlake.
4. The wait between each new episode of “Parks and Recreation.”
5. Reading the Wikipedia summaries of those books you haven’t gotten around to for your English class.
6. The Kanye/Kimmel feud of 2013.
7. Searching for a “joke” in the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.

Two summers ago, I landed in Lyons, France with six euros in my wallet, only enough for a meal at the local McDonald’s. I was afraid that I could not name anything on the menu besides “royale with cheese,” but instead of being greeted by a French-speaking cashier, I stood in front of a kiosk that displayed food items in photos and multiple languages. It was effortless to order what I wanted despite the language barrier, and I got my food almost immediately after paying at the same kiosk.
Last August, American fast food workers held strikes in more than 60 cities, demanding a $15/hour “living wage,” which is more than double the $7.25 federal minimum wage. The protest pits fast food workers against big corporations like McDonald’s. Having worked a minimum wage job at McDonald’s before college, I’m on the side of the workers, but I’m afraid I have to put my money on the big corporations. The fight, after all, might no longer be a zero-sum game between corporations and workers. It may be a fight between workers and machines that will ultimately replace them.
Before taking sides on the fast food “living wage” debate, we should take a look at a related debate on minimum wage, as the fast food industry employs the most minimum wage earners. Opponents of minimum wage argue that minimum wage laws are effectively a price floor for labor. When the price floor is higher than the price for labor in equilibrium, some employers who would hire an employee at a price below minimum wage would opt not to hire at the minimum wage. Those whose productivity is below the minimum wage will be laid off due to the legislation, and aggregate employment level will decrease. Minimum wage will hence not be an effective anti-poverty policy.
The empirical results for this argument are far from conclusive. A seminal paper by David Card and Alan Krueger showed that after New Jersey increased state minimum wage in 1992, employment in fast food restaurants actually increased in New Jersey compared to those in nearby Pennsylvania, although other labor economists disputed this finding. A more recent analysis of this topic using all county pairs across state borders showed no employment effect after increasing minimum wage. When President Obama called for an increase of minimum wage to $9 this year, economists were evenly divided on whether this policy would noticeably decrease employment opportunities for low-skilled workers.
Even if minimum wage increase did not have negative effect on employment in the past, there are good reasons why it will in the near future. We can look at the fate of other low-skilled workers to predict the future of the fast food industry. Airline ticket agents, for example, require similar skills as fast food cashiers. This is a slowly disappearing job, as airlines have been gradually replacing long check-in lines with more efficient and scalable check-in kiosks. The kiosks, in my experience, are even friendlier to use and give clearer instructions than ticket agents. Likewise, ATM has, in most cases, replaced bank tellers. If a machine is better at scanning our passports or depositing our checks, why do fast food companies not use them to take orders for food? My suspicion is that ticket agents and bank tellers, who are presumably more unionized and have greater bargaining power, are paid a higher wage than fast food workers. It makes sense to replace a ticket agent earning $16 an hour or a bank teller earning $12 an hour, but it does not make sense to replace a fast food cashier earning $7.25 an hour. As the cost of kiosk inevitably decreases and the wage of cashier increases, at some hourly wage between $7.25 and $12, workers will be displaced by the cheaper machines. At that point, it would be very difficult for fast food workers to compete with machines if they demand a higher wage.
Even at the current wage for fast food workers, early adopters like Wawa are experimenting with ordering kiosks exactly like the one I saw in Lyons. Smart phone app like Seamless and ChowNow are competing fiercely in the food ordering market. With higher level of automation technology in sight, a “living wage” of $15 an hour or a federal minimum wage of $9 an hour may not immediately push fast food employers to adopt automation technology, but it will certainly accelerate the process. It may be wise for policy makers to incentivize adoption of automation technology, as it allows us to do more with less people and greater efficiency. But the new technology won’t help those who depend on McDonald’s salary for a living.
Perhaps more so now than ever in history, the push for living wage or higher minimum wage is not a battle between labor and capital, but between wage earners against the machine.

A person can’t do everything at once, but Ernest L. Greer ’88 gets close. He is the chair-elect of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He is on the board of directors of Atlanta’s Center for Civil & Human Rights and The Woodruff Arts Center, which includes Atlanta’s main art museum, theater, and symphony.  He has been on other boards as well—the Atlanta Historical Society, the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Atlanta, and the Carter Center to name a few—and yet between these various affiliations he makes time for his law career at Greenberg Taurig LLP; he is the co-managing partner of the Atlanta office and one of eight global officers for the international law firm.  Amidst all of this Greer is happily married with two children. He somehow keeps everything going at once.
Some students worry that choosing a job necessitates leaving behind other interests to focus only on a profession. While choosing a career that matches one’s interests and talents is important, a person’s daily work need not encapsulate all of her ambitions at once.  There are ways to contribute to organizations and work for change in different spheres independent of one’s particular sector or workplace. Greer embodies this multi-faceted involvement.
“People ask me how I do all of these things,” says Greer, his voice pointed and intentional. “That question presumes that my priority is my economic success and the job that I work. Doing what I am doing in terms of my efforts to create inclusion is just as important to me as my 9 to 5 is.”
Greer’s personal mission is to foster a culture of inclusion in Atlanta—a mission that he works towards through a combination of community involvement, his board membership with many organizations, and his law practice.  He strives for a city where people of all backgrounds feel welcome and empowered to pursue what they want to prioritize, whether they aspire to be involved in business, education, the arts, or other fields entirely.
Greer has not always been an Atlanta man. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri to hard-working parents whose combined salary amounted to $44,000 at the height of their careers. He attended St. Louis Country Day School on scholarship, then came to Harvard where he played on the varsity football team.  He met his wife Patrice, a Wellesley graduate, three days before the start of his freshman year and the two have been together ever since.
With graduation in sight his senior year, Greer chose to turn down an investment banking job offer to instead attend Northwestern Law School on a fellowship. Then he spent a year doing clerk work in Detroit before he and Patrice moved south to Atlanta, her hometown, and started to build their careers in Georgia.
“Atlanta appears to be a town of great progress and integration, but if you look at the numbers it’s not,” Greer says, explaining how Atlanta is lauded for its superior professional opportunities for people of all races, but there is still much work to be done. Atlanta remains one of the best cities for African-American economic progress, Greer says, because the business community supports African-American advancement far better than Detroit, St. Louis, and most other cities do.  Even so, Greer points out that none of Atlanta’s Fortune 500 companies have a black CEO, CFO, CMO, or COO, and that very few African American lawyers in the city have achieved his level of seniority in their firms.
“Atlanta is a wonderful town with unbelievable potential, but if we don’t create inclusion then we will never get to the point of reaching that greatness that lies before us,” he says. “I realized as I watched this wonderful city grow that the big issue is not people desiring not to be inclusive, but people fearing inclusion, fearing the unknown.”
Greer draws an example from his work on the board of the Atlanta Historical Society. The society had traditionally shown exhibits on topics like the Civil War or Bobby Jones, a famous Atlanta golfer, but Greer encouraged the Historical Society to consider putting up an exhibit about Thomas Jefferson and Monticello that also chronicled five slave families who had lived on Jefferson’s plantation. The exhibit was expensive, but Greer raised enough money to sponsor the exhibit for eight weeks with weekends free so that even those without the discretionary income to pay for tickets would visit the Historical Society.
Greer mentions that he prioritizes this sort of inclusive work on the other boards he works on as well, and Patrice is making similar progress as a trustee on the Atlanta Ballet Board.  The two frequently host events at their home, always making sure that the guests come from as diverse an array of backgrounds and careers as possible.  “I think there should be an affirmative effort to expose yourself to and surround yourself with people of difference,” Greer says, noting that he tries to put himself in situations of difference and create those situations for his friends, too.  By opening up social spaces and organizations to include people of difference, the city becomes more accessible; its potential ripens.
Greer hangs up the phone. He needs to get back to his day job.

“Saying nothing,” wrote Emily Dickinson, “sometimes says the most.” The Crimson has never subscribed to the saying-nothing doctrine, and so in the wake of the October 23 launch of the Digital Emily Dickinson Archive we take the opportunity to express our pleasure in seeing all of Dickinson’s oeuvre united in one place for public enjoyment.
The origin story of the Dickinson Archive, marked with twists, turns, and bumps, is just as compelling and confusing as one of the author’s enigmatic poems. After decades of ownership disputes, things seemed finally to have fallen into place this past July: Amherst consented to offer up its collection of over 500 digitized works for inclusion in Harvard’s budding online anthology. But just as Harvard neared the finish line of the marathon effort, the Boston Globe reported that Amherst officials took issue with the unilateral, controlling way in which they believed Harvard had carried out the project.
Perhaps, as certain Amherst officials complain, Harvard should have paid Amherst more heed throughout the development process and credited Amherst more visibly on the final product. After all, the Dickinson Archive would remain the stuff of dreams without Amherst’s commitment to making it reality. But ultimately, the squabble between Amherst and Harvard focuses on petty concerns and detracts attention from the larger significance of Dickinson’s corpus existing all together on a single, easily accessible platform.
Few deny Dickinson’s talent or influence on poetry, literature, and art in general. Few contend that a literary education is complete without at least some time and thought devoted to Dickinson’s work. And until now, few could delve as deep into exploration of Dickinson’s repertoire as they might have liked. We are grateful that Harvard and Amherst have been able to resolve other differences over the years to facilitate this exploration at long last.
For example, Harvard at first wanted to charge a subscription fee to online viewers, while Amherst’s contribution came with the caveat that all works be available for free. Thankfully, Harvard capitulated, ensuring the wider dissemination of Dickinson’s opus. Amherst also desired that all Dickinson’s writings—not only her officially recognized poems as Harvard had planned but also her jotted-down musings and notes—appear in the archive. On this point, Harvard and Amherst came to another agreeable compromise: The manuscripts would join the initially posted poems in the future. We hope that Harvard and Amherst will similarly manage to set aside whatever quarrels remain in the interest of academic and public enrichment.
With her surviving works compiled online, Dickinson belongs no longer only to scholars lucky enough to travel from Massachusetts city to city to scrutinize them in person. Instead, she belongs to anyone and everyone who cares enough to sit at a computer, run a Google search, and click on the archive’s website. This is not only a service to academia; it’s also a service to humanity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve been wanting to write this article for a long time. I will open with the disclaimer that I try my best to avoid the cliché argument about “hook-up culture” (in fact, this will be the only time I use the term), but if I fall subject to certain platitudes, I apologize in advance. I also can’t promise that I will add anything new to the discussion of modern-day dating. Nevertheless, I believe it is one to be had, and re-had, especially among college students.
This past weekend, my friends and I took a trip to D.C. to visit our good friend, a girl attending college there. While we were out one night, one of us met a guy who was notorious on campus for sleeping around. The rest of us debated leaving her alone with him, knowing what we knew about his reputation. My D.C. friend had informed us, after all, that if our friend wasn’t planning on sleeping with him, this guy would most definitely ditch her and find someone else who would. Upon hearing this, I blurted out, “That’s disgusting.” I was angry to be faced yet again with a situation in which women were treated as disposable, and only good for one thing. What angered me more, however, was my D.C. friend’s reaction to my comment. “I mean it makes sense,” she said. “Why would a guy want to waste his time when he could find someone else to put out?”
Herein lies a troubling college mentality: Any time that does not meet, or at the very least advance toward, the main goal of sexual gratification is considered “a waste.” This transforms the innocence of conversation, flirtation, etc. into a means of obtaining a purely physical end. It allows sex to be viewed as a prize rather than a privilege, as a game with winners and losers. On Harvard’s own campus, I have often heard the terms “score” and “close” used to describe men who have, to use another questionable phrase, “sealed the deal” the night before. These terms of course imply that sex is the end goal in an artful sport of coercion. And what is there left to do once you have won the game?
Regardless of whether the desire by some students to have low commitment, immediately gratifying romantic encounters leads others to adopt this mentality as well (as suggested last year in The Washington Post), it is clear that both college men and women are of the hook-up mindset nowadays. As my friend’s comment makes clear, we as college students have been conditioned to think of romantic interactions as having certain sexual expectations. The more we adopt and perpetuate this mentality, the more it becomes excusable to dismiss others if they are not satisfying our sexual desires, or immediately after they do so. Perhaps more disturbingly, the more we adopt and perpetuate this mentality, the more it becomes taboo to demonstrate any interest in commitment.
While the empirical data is difficult to pinpoint, I have acquired a strong sense over the past years that any hint at commitment sends many college students running for the hills. In fact, for someone to even suggest a follow-up date seems to lead to the immediate presumption that they are looking for a serious commitment. Of course there is conflict among various statisticians or psychologists in terms of whether college students desire strictly sex, strictly relationships, or something in-between. But I challenge these students to tell me that they haven’t had multiple friends complain about their love life, and then tell me that it has nothing to do with someone’s fear of “being exclusive”.
Of course, there are the counter-arguments—I know them well. Yes, our bodies are our own and we reserve the right to do with them what we wish. Yes, many college students are involved in loving, committed relationships. Yes, the nature of dating itself changes with time. But not all change is good, and change can certainly be overturned.
So here’s my call to action. Next time, take someone out on a date. If it goes poorly, tell them it was nice meeting them and then don’t go out on another one. No one is pinning you down and forcing you to sign a marriage contract. Or maybe don’t get together with someone at all if you’re not prepared to see him or her as more than a means to an end. Whatever your decision, there are options other than viewing someone as strictly an opportunity for sex. I encourage you to take them. If you are not positively surprised by the results, I am willing to withdraw my case and subscribe to this newfound “college mentality” myself. After all, I’m not afraid of commitment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States’ current policy toward intervention in post-conflict countries is often ineffective, according to Andrew Radin, a research fellow in the Harvard Kennedy School’s International Security Program.
During a talk at the Kennedy School Thursday afternoon entitled “Spoiling Police Reform: Nationalism, Informal Networks, and International Authority,” Radin used police reform tactics as an example of Western mistakes in conflict zones. He specifically referenced his own research on the international community’s role in police reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo after the Balkan Wars of the 1990s.
Western countries typically try to aid war-torn areas by flooding those areas with resources, he said, but this strategy requires improvement. “We should be skeptical of the idea that greater resources and authority leads to successful police reform,” he said. “This can be a waste of the West’s resources.”
Radin added that popular nationalism and corruption networks are the two biggest obstacles to effective police reform and that Western policy should adapt to these realities.
In Bosnia, for example, former British politician Paddy Ashdown pushed for a series of police reforms that were fiercely opposed by Serbian nationalists out of fears that the reforms would lead to a loss of autonomy. “Even the prospect of membership in the European Union didn’t win them over,” Radin said. “Police reform failed there because international action was seen as blocking sovereignty.”
In contrast, Radin said, UN-led efforts for police reform in Kosovo succeeded partially because they did not conflict with Albanian nationalist desires to form an independent country. Their reforms ran into trouble, however, when they tried to combat corruption networks.
“Political parties killed witnesses and intimidated judges,” Radin said. “International forces were unable to outsmart the political elites, and corruption remains a huge problem there.”
Although case studies in the Balkans may seem far removed from current U.S. concerns, Radin argued that his work is applicable to American foreign policy, especially in Afghanistan.
Still, some audience members were not entirely convinced by the need for the U.S. to invest in police reform.
“Corruption and ethnic strife are big problems on their own,” said Sean M. Lynn-Jones, editor of the International Security Program’s quarterly journal “International Security.” “You could argue that police reform is trying to get the tail to wag the dog.”

A $5 million gift from media and entertainment titan Sheila C. Johnson will endow a new fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School to fund the expenses of emerging student leaders dedicated to improving the lives of the underserved in the United States, according to a press release Thursday.
“These fellowships can be a game changer in giving students concrete leadership skills and an expansive network to strengthen and transform communities,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 in the press release. “It is essential for us to attract people who understand the challenges faced by underserved communities.”
Every year for the next five years, ten Sheila C. Johnson Fellows will receive full tuition to the Kennedy School and any joint programs that they pursue at other Harvard graduate schools, along with full health coverage and a stipend. The fellows’ academic work will be complemented by leadership development and co-curricular education at the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.
“We need to develop more leaders with a broad skill set to serve African-American and other under-resourced communities,” Johnson said in the press release. “An ability to work across sectors—public, private, and nonprofit—and to inspire innovative politics will help bring the sustainable improvements that these communities desperately need.”
Once the fellowship launches next fall, Johnson’s role will be “hands on,” said Patricia S. Bellinger '83, the executive director of the Center for Public Leadership and a former Crimson editor. She plans to host the fellows at Salamander Hotels & Resorts, of which Johnson is CEO and founder.
Johnson’s philanthropy extends beyond her gift to the Kennedy School. She has done work for CARE, a humanitarian organization that seeks to address global poverty, and for Accordia Global Health Foundation’s International Council, which works to combat infectious disease in Africa.
In addition to her philanthropic work, Johnson has used her career in the media industry to advocate for African-American communities.
In 1983, Johnson helped co-found Black Entertainment Television, an American cable television channel which now reaches more than 90 million households. More recently, Johnson championed the making of the critically acclaimed historical motion picture “The Butler”—which chronicles many decades of service by an African-American butler at the White House—as both chief fundraiser for the film and its executive producer.
While “The Butler” sat atop box office charts, Johnson unveiled the inaugural Middleburg Film Festival, which was held last month in Middleburg, Virginia, where she lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Part V of a five-part series on Cambridge City Council election issues. Part I ran on Oct. 4, and Part II ran on Oct. 11, Part III ran on Oct. 18, and Part IV ran on Oct. 24. 
 
Several weeks ago, City Council candidate Marc McGovern perched on a swivel stool at the Harvard Square diner Leo’s Place on JFK Street to discuss his vision for the future of the area. As he spoke, he glanced periodically out the window, watching people rush back and forth past the Tasty Burger storefront across the street.
“How do we insure that Leo’s gets to stay here?” McGovern asked. “It's an establishment. It’s important for the fabric of our community.”
Over the last few years, national franchises, such as Starbucks, Yogurtland, and Shake Shack, have made Harvard Square their new home. In a series of interviews, city council candidates said that these chains have simultaneously edged out local stores and restaurants. Some of these candidates adamantly hoped to reverse the trend, but others expressed little concern.
Locally-owned, independent businesses now occupy three-fourths of the storefronts in Harvard Square, and Kendall Square has a similar composition, according to the areas’ business associations. The Central Square Red Ribbon Commission Subcommittee in its 2011 report wrote that Central Square maintains its “‘mom & pop store’ feel.” Yet the Commission also wrote that both Harvard and Central Square have experienced changes and that “Harvard Square has a ‘shopping mall’ feel” nowadays.
Many City Council candidates have continued to emphasize that Cambridge must work to preserve the eclectic flavor that makes Harvard Square so unique.
To many candidates, policies on licenses and rents should be crucial tools to maintain that balance. But few candidates could articulate cohesive plans for reform—primarily because the City Council sometimes does not have the tools at its disposal to enact sweeping changes. For example, Cambridge has bylaws that leave licensing to a separate commission rather than the council.
STRIKING A BALANCE
City Council candidates voiced concerns that national chains have entered many areas and have particularly encroached too far into Harvard Square—an area that was once primarily the domain of small businesses and mom-and-pop shops.
Over the last few months, an influx of national stores has prompted some candidates to fear that the character of Harvard Square and Cambridge as a whole could become swallowed up by a sea of chains.
“Harvard Square has lost a lot of local business,” said candidate Janneke House. “We’ve seen a bump in nightlife, but we’ve lost a lot of local flavor.”
But candidates disagreed about how to combat the loss of local business. Some suggested that the city ought to foster opportunities for new small businesses.
For example, Nadeem Mazen, a candidate who opened two education start-ups in Central Square, has advocated for using city grants to promote start-up businesses. He envisions those grants going to artistic and cultural business endeavors.
Mazen said he especially hopes to attract innovative businesses to the developer-owned and university-owned spaces that often remain vacant—a trend he partly attributed to the City Council, business associations, and universities not communicating enough.
Cambridge needs a “framework that is friendly to local business with grant programs,” Mazen said. “Unless we more clearly exclude formula businesses, we're going to see a lot of fast food and a lot of formula restaurants.”
Other candidates echoed a desire to prevent formulaic chain stores from entering the Square and instead foster a balance between local and national businesses. They said they hope for a practical combination of diverse, eclectic stores and traditional businesses such as banks and pharmacies.
“The mix of businesses is really important,” McGovern said. “Having small, locally-owned businesses and larger chain businesses is good. The reality is that you need a place to bank.”
Harvard Square still boasts a diverse set of businesses: burger joints, hardware stores, and even a shop dedicated to honey-themed products and another to hemp clothing.
Still, some candidates noted glaring gaps. For example, Harvard Square’s 7-Eleven, which closed last year, was one of the few Square stores that sold basic foodstuffs.
“I love Tasty Burger, but I miss 7-Eleven,” McGovern said. “Where do you go to buy a coke in Harvard Square or—god forbid—munchies at 2 a.m.? That’s a loss.”
McGovern and House both said they hoped that Harvard Square might eventually see a convenient, reasonably-priced grocery store that could cater to local residents.
Some candidates suggested that the increase in the tourism industry in Harvard Square has led businesses that serve local residents to fall by the wayside.
Candidate Elie Yarden remembered when The Harvard Coop was a department store that carried a variety of goods.
“Now it’s taken up by Harvard souvenirs,” he said. “Tourism is an important industry, but it shouldn’t be only tourists. The stores here should also supply the needs of the community.”
McGovern also commented on the prevalence of tourists in Harvard Square. To McGovern, striking balance requires accommodating the needs of locals and tourists alike.
“This is obviously the tourist center,” McGovern said. “That has to be taken into account. You have to make sure that people feel safe and welcome in a destination spot.”
RENT REFORM
Kendall Square, an area of Cambridge that has recently undergone a massive redevelopment push, changed zoning bylaws to accommodate smaller businesses that sometimes struggle to afford the rent on massive properties. The altered zoning requirements have particularly encouraged mixed-use development.
The city-sponsored K2C2 plan, a planning study on Kendall Square and Central Square, also benefits the push. Some candidates said they would like to see the Cambridge City Council conduct research and enact similar reform for Harvard Square.
“We can zone for areas to allow small businesses to open up,” House said. “The K2C2 plan would help achieve this in terms of what to do when the local businesses are being priced out and making sure the residents don’t leave as well.”
Other candidates said they planned to combat the actions of landlords that partly stymie local business. Jefferson R. Smith encouraged an open dialogue among landlords and the city, remarking particularly on the tendency of landlords to hold out for longer contracts with tenants and thus leave storefronts empty for prolonged periods of time.
Yarden called for an even stricter approach to mitigate the effects of out-of-reach rent for small business owners.
“Everything is money. It’s not supply and demand. Rent control is a necessity. A big problem in Cambridge is the wealth,” Yarden said.
Although a plurality of candidates decried the exorbitant rent prices facing business owners in Harvard Square and Cambridge at large, many noted that the City Council would probably be unable to reverse the trend.
Current City Councillor Minka Y. vanBeuzekom, who is running for reelection, said that as long as property owners decide they want certain rent prices, the city wields little power to change the situation.
Candidate Logan E. Leslie ’16 said he agreed that the city can make little change.
“The only way to effectively bring rents down is to make [Harvard Square] a less attractive place to live,” Leslie said. “[Rents] probably will rise until businesses no longer want to be there.”
GETTING THROUGH THE SYSTEM
“I want Cambridge to be a place that’s accessible to everyone,” said candidate Luis Vasquez. “That doesn’t only mean for housing. That means business, as well.”
Despite that desire, the process of securing business licenses in Cambridge poses an obstacle for some potential tenants. The Cambridge License Commission issues licenses to aspiring business owners around the city and enforces rules regarding the sale of alcohol. The commission, which includes a chairman and representatives of the fire and police departments, holds hearings twice a month where they vote on the proposed licences.
Although a separate entity, the License Commission occasionally collaborates with the City Council. Mazen said that the current complexities of license acquisition mean that mainly those with millions of dollars for large projects have the ability to navigate the system, which threatens the small-business culture of the city.
“I’ve seen first hand how challenging it is, and if we're not going to rewrite the laws, we at least have to be proactive about educating people on how they can get throughout the system,” Mazen said.
Several of Mazen’s fellow candidates expressed a similar goal of streamlining the licensing process. Mushtaque Mirza said he hopes to create a more unified plan rather than granting licenses on an case-by-case basis.
Others, however, said they are content with the status quo.
Current City Councillor Leland Cheung, who is up for reelection, said that Cambridge has a far more transparent licensing process than Somerville or Boston. Cambridge is more willing to work with potential business owners, he said.
Candidate Gary Mello said he was satisfied with the increased number of non-transferable licenses issued in Harvard Square.
“We’ve been very generous the last few years in the number of new licenses we’ve permitted,” Mello said. “I think they’re working.”
But regardless of where they fall on licensing regulations, some candidates seemed reluctant to interfere with the License Commission. Indeed, the Council has historically abstained from interfering with the Commission—as Seidel suggested, perhaps because the lengthy process of obtaining a license plays an important role.
“We can always look at making governmental process more efficient,” Seidel said. “But we are always going to want to have some process because voices need to be heard and we need to work of the conflicts that emerge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Embedded in Article IV of the Constitution of the Undergraduate Council is a provision that allows for “any question” to be voted on as a referendum if supported by at least 10 percent of the student population in a preliminary petition. If approved in an election in which the majority of undergraduates cast a ballot, that referendum proposal becomes the official position of the UC.
In recent decades, the referendum process has been evoked in varying forms by undergraduates advocating for changes in student government representation, term-bill fees, and the final exam schedule, among other issues.
Last fall, after five years without any referenda, three student groups with three distinct policy aims rediscovered this method of activism and turned to the UC to provide a clarification of the referendum process. From these discussions emerged referendum questions advocating for divestment of the University’s endowment from fossil fuels, a revision of the College’s sexual assault policy, and the creation of a social choice fund. All three referenda passed with the support of an overwhelming majority of student voters in the UC presidential election.
But in the year that followed, this initial wave of student support has not always been translated into administrative actions.
As students prepare to vote on a referendum question later this month calling for the expansion of gender-neutral housing options, organizers of last year’s referenda acknowledge that the process has its limits. Though activists say the referendum process remains a valuable tool to demonstrate student interest in certain issues and raise awareness on campus about these topics, they say the events of the past year have shown that the process is no panacea.
CHOOSING SOCIAL CHOICE
Among last year’s three referendum proposals, just one—the creation of a social fund—has been enacted by the administration.
The social choice fund referendum, organized by the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition, called on the University to allow donors to make contributions that would only be invested in companies that make a “positive social impact.” Less than a month after 80.5 percent of the undergraduates voting in last fall’s UC election supported the referendum question, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard would create a social choice fund, citing appeals from students and alumni.
Samuel F. Wohns ’14, a member of Responsible Investment, said he did not think the referendum alone convinced administrators to establish the fund. He credited his group’s spring 2012 establishment of the Fair Harvard Fund, an initiative pushing for the creation of a social choice fund, as another important contributing factor.
Yet Wohns said that while he thinks the Fair Harvard Fund and other forms of pressure would have eventually persuaded Harvard to establish the fund even without the referendum, he believes the referendum made the process easier.
“I think that that second wave of support and pressure...based on the very widespread, clear demonstration of support from the student body, was one of the critical steps of achieving our campaign goal of getting the University to create a social choice fund,” Wohns said.
Still, Wohns said he was not completely satisfied with the social choice fund’s implementation, saying he was disappointed by the extent to which Harvard administrators have publicized and promoted the fund. The referendum process should not be seen as a “be all and end all,” he added.
“Use [the referendum process] as an opportunity to get out the vote, to contact as many students as possible, and to really mobilize campus,” Wohns said. “But recognize that the University is in no way obligated to follow the will of the student body, that it is a powerful and important but limited tool for advocacy on campus.”
THE REJECTED REFERENDUM
Supporters of fossil fuel divestment have seen just how “limited” referendum results can be in pushing the University to change its practices.
Since the divestment referendum was approved with the support of 72 percent of student voters last fall, the University has come out against divestment from fossil fuels several times. Most recently, Faust reaffirmed the University’s rejection of divestment in a letter addressed to the Harvard community in early October.
Despite the University’s firm anti-divestment position, divestment advocates say they are not demoralized.
“[The referendum] showed that [this movement] is not just a few crazy people; this is something that most of the students are really interested in and is a mainstream [issue],” said Harold N. Eyster ’16, a member of divestment advocacy group Divest Harvard.
The greatest benefit from the referendum vote, according to Eyster, was its success in encouraging more students to join the cause on campus and to “galvanize” students across the country to start similar movements on their campuses.
“A lot of the people working directly on our campaign who are an integral part of it right now were alerted to it by the referendum,” Eyster said. “It helped to alert them that [this movement] exists and that it’s something that a lot of other students think is really important.”
Eyster said that although Harvard’s continued rejections of divestment might appear as “blocks” to the movement, he believes the University’s continued engagement with the issue allows the group to keep the conversation going.
For example, the Harvard Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility has met with divestment activists and UC leadership three times since last November. According to UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14, the dialogue in these meetings has gotten “more and more productive.”
“The encouraging thing, and something that I find curious about the case of divestment in particular is that the members of the CCSR don’t have to meet with undergraduates,” Raghuveer said. “These are very smart, very important people and they have taken their time out of their visits to campus, now repeatedly, to meet with the undergraduates who are organizing this campaign.”
ASSAULT POLICY IN LIMBO
The advocates pushing for a revision of the College’s sexual assault policy have also seen that student support can only go so far in convincing administrators to change course.
Last fall, the referendum asking College administrators to reexamine their sexual assault policies passed with the highest level of support–85 percent–among the three referenda. Yet that referendum has yet to generate any policy changes–a disparity that Raghuveer said she finds concerning.
“I think it’s an important, interesting, and troubling observation that the issue that was the most popular—that is the closest to Harvard undergraduates—has received less support, less engagement, and less active response than the other two issues that are University-wide issues that are further from students,” Raghuveer said.
Even before students finished voting on the issue during last year’s UC presidential election, then-Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds told The Crimson that the College’s sexual assault policy was unlikely to change in the near future.
Still, after the referendum passed, Hammonds commissioned a working group to study the College’s existing sexual assault resources and any potential improvements that could be made. The working group met from last December until the end of the spring semester before writing a report during the summer recommending improvements, according to activist Pearl Bhatnagar ’14.
Meanwhile, Mia Karvonides, the University’s recently appointed Title IX Coordinator, has sanctioned a separate working group at the University level to develop recommendations for changes to sexual misconduct policies and procedures across all Harvard schools.
In an emailed statement Wednesday, Karvonides wrote that the working group is “moving towards the end of this process” and that the Harvard community could expect to see results in the coming months.
But Bhatnagar, who is a lead organizer for the Our Harvard Can Do Better campaign, which organized the referendum, said she is concerned about the way administrators have approached the issue of sexual assault policy reform.
For one, she said, the working group was not charged with examining two proposals that were enumerated in the original referendum—endorsing the concept of “affirmative consent” to sex and clarifying the definition of “mental incapacitation” that would make a person unable to consent to sex.
Bhatnagar also said that the sexual assault policy discussion has been complicated by the recent departures of several administrators involved in those conversations. She pointed to Hammonds’s resignation as Dean of the College over the summer, and Sarah Rankin’s departure as director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response this fall to become the Title IX Investigator at MIT.
“With the point people no longer in their posts, we have to rebuild relationships,” Bhatnagar said.
Bhatnagar said that although she has yet to see any changes to the College’s sexual assault policy, she still believes the referendum was productive. “The referendum was a clear way of showing...that the student body wanted to revisit the procedures around sexual assault,” she said.
According to Bhatnagar, the referendum offered a “great building point” for the sexual assault reform campaign to conduct more research into student perspectives and necessary steps to change the policy.
Still, she said that research has shown that in working with Harvard’s intricate bureaucracy, merely holding a referendum vote is not enough to convince administrators to change their position. “Once you do get students to vote on your referenda there are a host of other steps that need to be taken by the activists involved that may not be clear given the decentralized nature of Harvard University,” Bhatnagar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the Undergraduate Council’s budget constrained and its ability to fund student organizations increasingly limited, some club sports groups on campus have received less UC funding this year than expected and have had to make spending cuts or raise fees to adjust.
 
At its Oct. 20 meeting, the UC approved about $32,000 in club sports funding and awarded grants to 32 groups. Although the $32,000 in funding to those groups is comparable to recent years, it is also 54 percent less than the Finance Committee would have given the groups were there not a budget constraint, according to legislation authored by UC Finance Committee chair Matthew R. Marotta ’14.
 
The largest grant that a club sports group received this fall was $1,275, a sizeable decrease from last year, when groups received up to $2,000.
 
“It’s mostly the newer and less-institutionally endowed clubs that are suffering from this,” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said. “That enforces inequality at this school that we want to avoid.”
 
The men’s club lacrosse team is one of 14 club sports groups that received $1,275 but applied for more. Ernie J. Doherty ’15, the group’s president, said his team will probably have to raise membership dues and may buy less gear this year. The team may also hire friends on the varsity lacrosse team to referee their games instead of outside refs, Doherty said.
 
The women’s club soccer team also received $1,275 instead of its usual $2,000, and according to treasurer Julia B. Hyman ’15, the group is trying to save some money on transportation by recruiting local team members to drive cars to away games. To raise money in the past, the team has worked dorm crew and timed a varsity swimming event. Hyman said the team plans to continue such fundraisers but that those will likely not raise $725.
 
For some club sports groups, the effect of receiving less funding has not been too significant. The figure skating club has made only “little changes” to its operations in light of the reduced funding, according to Hannah C. Donoghue ’14, the club’s co-president. As an example of one small adjustment the club has made, Donoghue cited an approximately $5 extra charge on figure skating jacket orders for undergraduates, graduates, and alumni. Still, Donoghue called the changes “nothing too drastic.”
 
The UC has proposed an increase in undergraduates’ termbill fees to address its budget constraints and the student group funding issue.
 
UC representatives held a meeting with Associate Director of Athletics Gary Brown on Tuesday to present a report on club sports funding. Increased funding from the UC or more funding support from the Athletics department were both discussed as options to increase increase club sports funding, according to Raghuveer.

Facing constraints in manpower and space, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is set to make twenty new tenure-track hires and is preparing for its building projects in Allston, SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray told The Crimson in an interview this week.
The $450 million that SEAS seeks to raise in its portion of the Campaign for Arts and Sciences, which launched last weekend, will fund the new hires, Murray said. The new construction projects, which are slated to begin in the coming months, will receive funding from other money raised in the Harvard Campaign, the University-wide capital campaign that encompasses all of the fundraising drives for individual schools and faculties. The overall Harvard Campaign, launched in September, aims to raise a total of $6.5 billion.
Because it is affiliated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the SEAS fundraising goal was announced along with the total FAS goal last weekend. According to SEAS spokesperson Caroline M. Perry, SEAS has already raised $100 million.
The fundraising drive comes at a critical time for SEAS, which has seen enrollment grow at a rapid pace in the last five years. In the 2012-2013 academic year over 5,000 Harvard College students took a SEAS class, compared to almost 2,000 in 2008-2009, according to fundraising materials. The number of SEAS concentrators has also grown consistently in recent years.
“Until really the last decade [the SEAS concentrations have] been considered [subjects] that [weren’t] quite proper for gentlemen and gentleladies to be studying,” computer science professor Harry R. Lewis '68 said. “Now [they are] much more central to the Harvard stream of thought than it used to be.”
But that increase in enrollment has created issues within SEAS. Most notably, faculty and administrators say the school is running out of space, and that research labs and classrooms in buildings like Maxwell Dworkin, Pierce Hall, and the Science Center are too crowded.
“We need, not surprisingly, more lecturers and space,” Murray said, citing the growing flow of undergraduates through SEAS programs. “Undergraduates are demanding to be taught.”
Lewis, who told The Crimson that he has 43 undergraduate advisees, echoed Murray’s sentient that SEAS has run out of manpower and space.
“We’re just strained in every direction... it is not clear that if we actually hired somebody that [we would] be able to give them an office,” he said.
When the move to Allston was announced in the spring, many SEAS faculty were surprised and upset, with some dubbing the announcement “the Allston Bomb.” Now, with space and manpower limitations pressing and the vision of the building projects more clear, faculty members say the move is a solution to an important problem, Lewis said.
“There’s been more time for people to understand what might be possible,” he said, explaining that administrators seemed to share the vision of creating “a real Harvard campus, a real Harvard study, work, research and hangout environment,” across the river.
“Since we’ve had that dialogue with the faculty, I think a lot more have gotten excited about [the move],” Lewis said.
Murray also expressed excitement and said that more SEAS faculty seemed to be coming on board to the idea of relocating.
“Faculty are adamant that they want great teaching spaces in Allston, and that will bring students and other faculties to teach there because there will be really great spaces,” Murray said. “There will be faculty intermixed between different schools, which would be wonderful for students, and it will be a liberal arts environment plus a professional school environment.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Harvard football team suffered its first defeat of the season at the hands of Princeton in triple overtime. It may not get much easier for the Crimson this Saturday when Dartmouth comes to town.
Although Harvard cruised to a 31-14 victory in the matchup last year, the Big Green (3-3, 2-1 Ivy) has proven its mettle against Ancient Eight foes so far this season and is currently tied with the Crimson for third place in the conference.
With each remaining game a must-win for Harvard’s hopes of an Ivy League championship, the Crimson (5-1, 2-1) will need to reset and defeat a Dartmouth squad that has potent playmakers on both sides of the ball.
“I think you’re going to learn just how resilient we are,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Our kids have a tremendous amount of pride. Some years you lose a tough game like this, and you’ve got a maybe average opponent. We don’t have that luxury.”
Indeed, if the Crimson is looking to have a rebound game, it will have to earn it  –  by no means will the Big Green hand over a victory on a platter.
Dartmouth’s only conference loss has come in early October, when last year’s champion Penn finally punched the ball into the end zone in the fourth overtime period to end the longest game in Ivy League history.
The Big Green will roll into Cambridge with plenty of momentum, making matters even more difficult for a Harvard squad looking to regain its footing. Last week, Dartmouth cruised to a thumping, 56-0 victory over Columbia.
“[The Big Green] is a really great team,” said senior wide receiver Ricky Zorn. “We scrimmaged them in the preseason, so we know what to expect. We know it’s going to be a hard fought game, and we’re going to have to be playing our best football to beat them.”
Much of Dartmouth’s success this year can be attributed to its performance when it doesn’t have the ball, as the Big Green ranks number one in the Ivy League in both total defense and scoring defense. Last week, Dartmouth held the Lions to only five first downs, and it limited a capable Yale offense to just 264 yards in a 20-13 victory three weeks ago.
The losses of two key players to injury against Princeton will not help the Harvard offense this Saturday. Senior center David Leopard suffered a broken ankle, significantly weakening the ability of the offensive line to protect junior quarterback Conner Hempel. And sophomore receiver Andrew Fischer, whose speed gave the Crimson a potent deep threat, is out with a torn hamstring.
On the offensive side of the ball, the Dartmouth attack is fueled by its running game. Senior running back Dominick Pierre is averaging nearly 130 yards on the ground, highlighted by a 167-yard performance in the win over Yale. Harvard will look to ensure that Pierre does not have a repeat performance come Saturday.
“Our number one focus entering any game is stopping the run,” said senior defensive back D.J. Monroe. “That’s one of our goals for victories, is under 100 yards rushing for any running back. I’m sure the d-line will be getting after those guys down low in the gaps and making it harder to find lanes to run through.”
The Big Green boasts another playmaker in sophomore quarterback Dalyn Williams, who is a threat to run and pass and has accounted for 11 touchdowns in the team’s six games so far. One key of this weekend’s game will be the ability of the Crimson defense to keep the Big Green inside the hash marks.
“In a league that’s got a lot of really great quarterbacks, Dalyn Williams is probably the most athletic of all of them,” Murphy said. “Ivy League Rookie of the Year as a freshman, lightening quick, and we have to account for him on every single play.”
When Princeton quarterback Quinn Epperly found his receiver Roman Wilson in the corner of the end zone last Saturday, many Harvard players undoubtedly experienced a sick sense of déjà vu.
But if the Crimson has any intentions of keeping its goal of an Ancient Eight championship alive, it will need to temporarily discard that defeat from memory and fully focus on the tough task at hand this week.
“We’ve got four games left,” Zorn said. “Right now though, we’re focused on beating Dartmouth. We know that we might not be able to afford another loss. But to be able to win out we’ve got to win every single game, and that starts with the first game we have to play on Saturday versus Dartmouth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Interim Harvard women’s hockey coach Maura Crowell has yet to lose a game in her stint at the helm (2-0, 2-0 ECAC), leading her squad to two wins in the Bright-Landry Center in its opening games of the season. This weekend, the Crimson looks to stay perfect as it hits the road for the first time this year, taking on Rennselaer and Union.
No. 7 Harvard heads to New York this Friday to take on division foe Rensselaer (1-5-1, 0-0). After winning their season opener against Robert Morris, the Engineers have been winless in their last six games and are still looking for their first victory in Troy.
“RPI is always a tough game for us,” Crowell said. “They play very physically…. We’re going to have to come in ready, play physical, and get to the dirty areas.”
The Crimson has gotten off to a strong start due in large part to the efforts of sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer. After defeating Quinnipiac on Friday, the second-year star stopped 44 shots, a career high, on Saturday in a shutout performance against rival Princeton. The ECAC goaltender of the week leads the league with a .969 save percentage.
“[Emerance] is that kid that will show up every weekend,” junior captain Marissa Gedman said. “Last weekend proved that.”
Despite losing its leading scorer last season to graduation, Harvard has had several players help fill her shoes and keep the offensive attack strong. After scoring eight goals in the team’s 34 games last season, junior Hillary Crowe has already put in three goals in two games, an average that leads the league thus far. Sophomore Dylanne Crugnale and junior Sarah Edney have also added to the offensive firepower with two goals each on the season.
“Hillary Crowe lit it up this weekend and we’re looking for her to next weekend as well,” Gedman said. “[But] every one of our forwards is a huge proponent to our offense.”
A large part of the Crimson’s success on the attack is due to its performance on the power play. In its eight attempts on the year, the Crimson has converted five a conversion rate that leads the ECAC.
“They’re confident in reading the pressure really well,” Crowell said. “When you are confident…you make your own luck by executing and working hard.”
The Engineers have not had such success on the man-advantage, scoring only 7.7 percent of the time. Although Rennselaer offense has been sluggish, two freshmen have stepped up on the attack. First-years Laura Horwood and Taylor Mahoney have helped lead the Engineers, recording a team-leading five and four points, respectively.
Harvard will stay in New York on Saturday to take on Union (3-5, 0-0). The Crimson looks to continue its historical success against the Dutchwomen, having been victorious in all matchups in the 21st century.
Union is looking to improve on last year’s campaign in which it failed to win a conference game. The offense this year has been much improved, averaging a goal more per game than it did last season.
“Union is definitely on the rise,” Crowell said. “They’ve beaten some teams this year that they haven’t beaten in their prior history.”
The Union defense will have to improve on its penalty kill in order to take down Harvard this Saturday. The Dutchwomen have only stopped opponents’ power plays 67.9 percent of the time, the second lowest rate in the league.
Sophomore Courtney Turner and junior Christine Valente have propelled the Dutchwomen offense thus far. The two have each put up four goals on the season, helping Union average more than two goals per game. Senior Maddy Norton and junior Bryanne Panchuk have also helped the attack, each adding a team-high four assists.
The Dutchwomen have benefitted from their performance on the power play, scoring on 21.9 percent of their opportunities this season. They will be hard-pressed to score on the man-advantage against the Crimson, who has not allowed a goal in its eight penalty kills this season.
“[The veterans] are bringing their experience and expertise to the ice and helping the younger kids who are being put into huge situations,” Crowell said.
Although Harvard’s ultimate goal is to return to the NCAA tournament, the team is focused on this weekend to make sure it leaves New York without a loss.
“Both teams play very well defensively and have the ability to keep games close against teams that are better than them on paper,” Crowell said. “So we can’t take anyone lightly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ivy League’s cross country teams have spent the past few months competing across the nation, but only the Heptagonal Championships this weekend brings them all together. This year, with a number of Crimson runners at their collegiate primes, the field is set for a race to the rankings—and quite possibly, the podium.
“I’m excited, and I’m looking forward to going into the competition,” men’s coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s always a special, special meet for our team, our student-athletes, and for me as a coach.”
The men’s team, ranked No. 21 in the latest USTFCCCA poll, is sure to produce highlights. Co-captains James Leakos and Maksim Korolev are running for their last times at Heps, and after an outstanding season, expectations for them are high.
Leakos and Korolev finished first and second, respectively, at the Harvard-Yale dual meet earlier in the season, as they did the year before. But unlike the 2012 season, in which Korolev and Leakos were only able to finish 18th and 39th out of hundreds in the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, 2013 saw the pair both finishing in the top ten.
Such strong records of performance from the Harvard co-captains throughout this fall could very well establish them in a race for first place on Saturday. None of the runners finishing ahead of Korolev and Leakos in the Wisconsin Invitational—which also featured No. 10 Columbia and Dartmouth—will be competing in the Championships this Saturday, and as such, the field is open for a dramatic Ivy finish to the duo’s final season.
“We’re just going out, and if the other guys go with us, and are able to go with us, we’re just going to battle it out and have a good time,” Korolev said. “We’re just going to go ‘Super Saiyan’ out there like we always do…[and] hopefully put ourselves in the best position possible.”
While Korolev and Leakos are likely to be in contention for first place individually on Saturday, the men’s squad is expected to have a tougher time. Spreads of up to 65 seconds between the squad’s first five runners have disadvantaged the Crimson against other schools in the past. With the points calculated as the sum of the first five finishing places for a team, it will be crucial to close the persistent gap between Leakos, Korolev, and the rest of the men’s team.
“The tighter one through five is, the more successful we’ll be,” Saretsky said. “That’s how the nature of cross country is.”
Columbia and Ivy perennial-power Princeton are the favorites to battle for the men’s team title, but with a strong performance from its supporting cast, Harvard may be able to pull of the upset.
“There’s no question that Columbia and Princeton are very established teams, especially Princeton, being the defending champion, and what they were able to do last year,” Saretsky said. “I really feel that [Princeton is] probably the favorite for the meet, but it should be fun to see how we can match up.”
The Harvard women, although absent a consistent frontrunner, still aim to produce a strong performance with a solid display of teamwork and cohesion. The leading five, often running in a tight pack, have had past success working off of each other and hope to continue to do so this Saturday.
“Not having that superstar athlete [in comparison to the men’s team] is not as much of a factor,” junior Viviana Hanley said. “I think that the pack running that we’ve done in the past is really going to be a strong play for us.”
Among the expected leaders will be seniors Morgan Kelly and Emily Reese, as well as Hanley and classmate Molly Renfer. Hanley edged Yale’s Liana Epstein by a second in the Harvard-Yale season opener, but with the overall team consistency in mind, many possibilities remain as for Saturday’s performance.
Others who might contribute to the success of the women’s team this weekend include freshman Madeleine Ankhelyi, and junior Jen Guidera. With consistent finishes among the top five, strong performances from these two and the rest of the team will be crucial for the Crimson to catch its higher-ranked Ivy counterparts.
The pre-race favorite on the women’s side is No. 11 Dartmouth, which is led by four-time track and field national champion Abbey D’Agostino. Cornell and Princeton are also among the USTFCCCA-ranked schools from the Ancient Eight.
“Abbey D’Agostino is almost certainly going to win,” Hanley said. “But second place [and] third place are reachable positions for anyone on our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the well-known book series, A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket, a trio of children undergoes ill-fated events following their parents’ death. There’s Violet, the oldest child who invents ways to get her two siblings out of trouble. There’s Klaus, the middle child who reads a lot. And there’s Sunny, a baby who enjoys biting things and somehow has really advanced problem-solving skills for an infant.
Before the death of their parents, things go swimmingly for the children. But afterwards, things often do not go the way of the Baudelaires. Behind all of their troubles is the evil Count Olaf, a tall guy with a unibrow whose lone goal in life is to disrupt the lives of the Baudelaires.
On the Sixth Saturday of the past two Ivy League football seasons, the Baudelaires’ parents die. Count Olaf comes to town. The lives of three children are ripped asunder. Or, as others might say, Harvard football faces what’s quickly becoming the most dreaded game of its season—Princeton.
Prior to last weekend, the Baudelaires’ lives—henceforth known as the Harvard football team—were mostly unblemished. Yes, there was that eternal issue of injuries plaguing the team—at kicker, at quarterback, at offensive line, and most recently at linebacker, but never before had it had a crippling effect. A 5-0 record evidenced this, as did a general level of confidence entering Saturday’s game.
But something about the arrival of the orange and black uniforms rings of Halloween arriving early in Cambridge—with the scary man behind the door, of course, being a tall, probably unibrowed (though the helmets made it difficult to verify) Princetonian. And on Saturday, there were a number of Count Olafs running around Harvard Stadium.
There were the obvious nemeses—Quinn Epperly and Roman Wilson, the QB-WR combo that had finished off Harvard in the shell-shocking 2012 upset, who appeared in a reincarnation of their last season selves to pull off more last-minute heroics and top Harvard in triple overtime.
There was Caraun Reid and the rest of the Tigers’ defensive line, which combined for seven sacks and made Conner Hempel’s life miserable.
And there was the head Count Olaf himself—coach Bob Surace, who created enemies out of both the Harvard football team and the TV announcers after taking no-huddle offense to the extreme and running plays every five seconds.
Harvard put forth a valiant effort. But even though Violet—let’s give this honor to the veteran Harvard defense—continually bailed out the offense in the second half and gave the team numerous opportunities to win, the versatile and well-oiled machine that was the Princeton offense eventually prevailed.
The suffocating Princeton D-line threw a number of blitzes at Klaus—quarterback Conner Hempel—who tried to read them, but with an inexperienced offensive line, there was little he could do to avoid a seven-man rush.
And Sunny—poor backup Andrew Flesher, the walk-on kicker who stepped in with David Mothander still sidelined—was asked to hit a 50-yard field goal to win the game in the waning seconds of regulation. It seemed almost inevitable that the ball would sail towards the uprights, have enough air behind it, and miss just wide left.
In the books, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny eventually survive the onslaught of Olaf. But on Saturday, Chapter one of the series of unfortunate events was too much for Harvard.
With the departure of Princeton, will the curse lift? Will the Baudelaires prevail? Only time will tell…
DARTMOUTH (3-3, 2-1 Ivy) AT HARVARD (5-1, 2-1 Ivy)
Dartmouth’s 56-0 victory over Columbia demonstrates just one thing: the Big Green has enough people on their roster to put together a football team. It seems that’s the only prerequisite these days to beat (re: completely demolish) the Lions.
So even though Dartmouth is coming into the weekend off of a lopsided win and Harvard may have some self-esteem issues after losing to Princeton and snapping a 15-game home streak, expect a tight game.
Because the Big Green lost to Holy Cross, a game that the Crimson also took to triple overtime—though this one ended with a W—I’m taking Harvard in a close one.
Prediction: Harvard 38, Dartmouth 34
COLUMBIA (0-6, 0-3 Ivy) AT YALE (3-3, 1-2 Ivy)
This game is being televised on the YES network, but if you’re looking for the answer to whether you should watch this game, it’s NO (also, please let me know if you have any idea a) what the YES network is and b) why they’re showing this game).
Yale’s lone Ivy win comes at the expense of one of the two Ivy teams without a single league win—Cornell. The other team with a grand total of zero Ancient Eight victories halfway through the season? Columbia.
This week’s matchup between last season’s bottom finishers may be made even less interesting by the absence of Yale tailback Tyler Varga (apparently so good he has his own tab on the Yale football website), who was injured two weeks ago, and starting quarterback Henry Furman.
But even if the Elis are without Furman and Varga come Saturday, it’s still Columbia, which through three games has been outscored by its Ivy opponents by 93 points.
Prediction: Yale 28, Columbia 7
CORNELL (1-5, 0-3 Ivy) AT PRINCETON (5-1, 3-0 Ivy)
If the Ivy League title race is the USS Enterprise, Princeton is Captain Kirk—in the driver’s seat, in control of its own destiny. With arguably its hardest game—Harvard— out of the way, winning out the season will give the Tigers the title for the first time since 2006.
But Princeton’s been in this position before—last year, the 2012 fourth-quarter meltdown of the Harvard football team gave the Tigers a 3-0 Ivy record.
They finished the season 4-3, tied for third in the league. Perhaps the shock of beating Harvard last year was too much to handle.
However, this year’s Princeton spaceship looks too polished to get tripped up by a Big Red asteroid again. It seems to have overcome its problem of slow starts, something that troubles Cornell. Jeff Mathews and—wait, just kidding, that’s Cornell’s entire team—his NFL-caliber arm won’t be enough to stop a rolling Tigers team back home at Princeton Stadium.
Prediction:  Princeton 52, Cornell 24
PENN (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) AT BROWN (4-2, 1-2 Ivy)
Despite an unbeaten league record, Penn’s playing like the dark horse that they were last season before swooping in to snatch the title in the penultimate game against none other than Harvard. Ivy record aside, their stats are wholly middling, but make no mistake—Penn may not have the flashy plays of Princeton or the (usually) explosive Harvard defensive, but obviously something about the grind-it-out mentality works.
QB Billy Ragone may be hurt for the Quakers, but out goes one veteran, in steps another 5th-year play-caller in Ryan Becker (seriously, where do they keep finding these guys?). If both are back, look for some exploitation of Brown’s secondary, which is 5th in the league in pass defense.
Penn will likely be looking at this as a stepping stone to the showdown of the Killer P’s—the following week’s matchup with Princeton—but don’t count out Brown to put up a fight.
Prediction: Penn 24, Brown 17

UPDATED: Nov. 1, 2013 at 10:56 a.m.
So what if you’ve been procrastinating on doing laundry for two weeks now? You still know you could do anything if you just put your mind to it—say, even writing a novel. You’ve got great plots floating around in your head, characters begging to be set free, and you’d like nothing more than to see your name on the cover of a full-length book. But how do you find the time? Amidst midterms, papers, and p-sets, it’s hard to imagine sitting down and writing anything without a deadline, let alone an entire novel. You’d never work up the motivation. Well, that’s what NaNoWriMo is for.
National Novel Writing Month—affectionately dubbed “NaNoWriMo”—was started in the San Francisco Bay area by Chris Baty in 1999. Last year, 341,375 writing enthusiasts from all over the world came together to take on the challenge of writing a 50,000 word novel in the thirty days of November. Yes, an entire novel in just one month.
I myself will be participating in NaNo for the sixth year in a row and couldn’t be more excited to write my latest novel on Harvard’s campus. If you’re interested in giving it a shot, know that Harvard has an entire community of writers gearing up for the hectic month together. The Harvard College Writers’ Workshop will host a number of events that they hope undergraduate WriMos (the preferred title) will take advantage of, starting with a kick-off party today, the first day of NaNo. HCWW also holds weekly writing events where writers can gather to eat snacks, share ideas, and just enjoy writing. On Friday, November 8, they’ll be hosting a semesterly event called In the Workshop of the Night, where writers come together to write for as long as they can, all night long. This isn’t just for NaNoWriMo—all writers and all projects are welcome—but it’s a chance to get some NaNo noveling done while enjoying the company of fellow writers.
Harvard students can also look off-campus and take advantage of Boston’s massive NaNoWriMo network, which hosts a number of regional write-ins all over the city, including many in the nearby Cambridge Public Library. These opportunities to share the trials and tribulations with a community, in my experience, have been one of the best things about NaNo.
“Obviously we’re all very pressed for time, as students. But honestly, we’ll probably always be pressed for time,” says Catherine C. Zuo ‘16, the Events Chair of HCWW and an eight-time NaNo participant. “NaNo is an amazing opportunity with so much creative energy flying around. If you have a novel in you at all, this is the time that you should let it out.”
So why not set your inhibitions and your Ec10 p-set aside—both are better off saved for later, anyway—and write the novel you’ve always been meaning to write? If you silence your inner editor, just allow the words to flow, and fight through the writers’ block, the 50,000-word finish line will be here before you know it. With a community of Harvard writers around you for support, there is no better time to give NaNoWriMo a shot.

We’re at a place that’s famously obsessed with rankings—especially ones that put the big H on top. Recently, The Atlantic did a comprehensive ranking of the college rankings that included a whole two rankings(!). Flyby wanted to embrace this idea while also expanding on it, so we undertook the project of an actual ranking of rankings.
1. Times Higher Education: Harvard ranked #1 overall by reputation.
First place goes to Times Higher Education, for providing the veritas on where we stand. 
2. Huffington Post: Harvard ranked as one of the most squirrel-obsessed colleges.
Fine, this wasn’t technically a ranking, but high marks for the astute observation. After all, Harvard students count more squirrels than sheep any day (sleep deprivation joke!).
3. Betches Love This: Harvard ranked #1 among the Ivies.
Betches Love This used criteria including Greek life, hotness, and celebrity alumni/children. Classic thorough, analytical methodology.
4. Student Advisor: Harvard ranked #1 social media college.
We’re still not quite sure what this means, but we’ll take it. Thank you, Zuck!
5. U.S. News and World Report: Harvard ranked #2 (after Princeton) 
Clearly a mistake. Next. 
 
6. Forbes: Harvard ranked #8 overall.
Giving us 8th means receiving the bottom slot on our list.

With the World Series over and the Fenway traffic winding down, you might want to know a few things about the Red Sox in case casual dinner conversation turns into a World Series recap discussion. We here at Flyby are here to help you make that conversation less awkward.
 
1.     The Red Sox won the World Series
Seems pretty obvious, huh? Well you’d be surprised about the number of people I’ve talked to who have asked me: “Wait—did the Red Sox or the Cardinals win?” We are in Cambridge! We’re basically in Boston! But, if you did (hopefully) already know that the Sox won, it’s the first time we’ve won at home since 1918. That’s right—95 years since the Sox have taken the title at Fenway Park. We can officially wish the Curse of the Bambino good riddance.
 
2.     Stephen Drew can, in fact, hit the ball
For a while there, I think most Sox fans lost all hope in infielder Stephen Drew’s hitting ability. There was even a twitter account called @DidDrewGetAHit, which constantly tweeted no whenever Drew struck out or didn’t get on base. Game 6 made this twitter account awkward, however, when Drew came to bat and hit a homerun. So, @DidDrewGetAHit, yes. Yes he did.
 
3.     Koji Uehara has the cutest son. Ever.
Out of all the postgame interviews after the Sox won the World Series in Game 6 (just a refresher in case you forgot), Koji Uehara’s son gave by far the best interview. When asked how proud he was of his dad, the Boston Red Sox closer who got the final out, Koji’s son responded “good.” If that’s not the cutest response you’ve ever heard, try this: when he was asked how hard he was going to celebrate that night, Koji’s son responded “crazy.” It doesn’t get much better than that.
 
4.     Big Papi knows how to pump up a crowd
David Ortiz (Big Papi to dedicated Sox fans) provides entertainment both on and off the field. Along with being named World Series MVP, Big Papi grabbed the mic to rile up Fenway Park, and he did so without fail. Back in April, following the Boston Marathon bombings, Ortiz told Boston fans “This is our f***ing city.” To relive this amazing quote during his postgame interview after Game 6, Ortiz slyly asked interviewers if he should keep it clean this time. He then shouted: “This is our bleeeeeeeeep city” to thousands of viewers. The crowd went wild.
 
5.     There is a parade this Saturday at 10 a.m.
Some of the best things about Boston is its sports, and even better are the celebrations that follow Boston championships. So, if you have nothing better to do on Saturday morning at 10 a.m. (which you shouldn’t, considering nothing ever happens late on Friday nights), head over to Boston and see the 2013 World Series Champions drive by on Duck Boats. It’s surely a sight you won’t want to miss.
 
 
NEED BLIND BIND. In reference to the recent financial aid bru-ha-ha at George Washington University, Forbes attempts to see how much of a scandal it really is. Apparently, a lot of the schools that are so-called “need-blind” might not actually fulfill this promise, factoring in financial need somewhere down the line.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS. Affirmative action came back to court as the Supreme Court justices heard arguments over whether or not Michigan has violated the Constitution by vetoing race-conscious affirmative action at public universities way back in 2006.
COLLEGE VISITS 2.0. Ever decided not to apply to a college because  it was raining when you visited and your parents were getting on your  nerves? Well Google+ apparently has the solution that could make bad  college visits disappear for good. Princeton Review has partnered with Google to use the popular Google Hangouts program to arrange  college info sessions, tours, and even private meetings with students or  admissions officers. We here at the Admissions Blog still hold torch  for the good old College Road Trip.
COMMON APP CATASTROPHE, CONT. The Common App has received some negative receptions recently due to technological glitches that have cause applicants to struggle with getting in their apps on time. In this NBC News report, several students weigh in on their experiences, and a competitor to the Common App is discussed.
 
FEAR OF APPLYING EARLY. FOMO isn’t just for the socially inhibited anymore. Time used the acronym (which stands for "fear of missing out") to address the concerns of early decision applicants that the school they just bound themselves to just might not be the one.
