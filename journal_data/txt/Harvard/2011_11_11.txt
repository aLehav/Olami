After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t expect to support Occupy Harvard. While I agree wholeheartedly with the broader Occupy movement’s critique of the financial industry and think the current level of economic inequality in the United States is beyond defense, I had strategic reservations. I thought the occupiers should have targeted members of Congress with the power to pass legislation benefiting the 99 percent, rather that banks that aren’t going to be persuaded of their own evils anytime soon. Occupiers, I reasoned, should get up in the faces of the people actually holding the cards.
But Occupy Harvard is doing just that, by congregating in front of University and Massachusetts Halls, where the people with the power to change course are working. It is easy to dismiss the tent-dwellers on Harvard Yard as dumb hippies with inchoate demands, but as the group’s press release yesterday showed, they know exactly what they are doing.
Their demands—our demands—are specific and Harvard-focused.  We want Harvard to pay its workers a living wage, whether they are high-flying endowment managers or janitors in the houses. We want Harvard to divest from other companies that treat their workers poorly. We want Harvard to be honest about how it’s spending its endowment so we know what is being supported in our name.
You can disagree with these demands if you like. But don’t hide behind the defense that Harvard is a private university that does not owe the world around it just treatment. Harvard is a private university, yes, but it is also a nonprofit that pays no taxes. It is thus the beneficiary of an enormous subsidy from the city of Cambridge, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the federal government. This subsidy comes with the proviso that Harvard serves the public interest.
If Harvard wants to abandon that obligation, fine. It should then start paying the federal corporate tax, state and local property taxes, and all other taxes from which nonprofits are exempt. Who knows, maybe some of the revenue such a change causes could be sent to community colleges and other higher education institutions that actually commit themselves to the public good.
Occupy Harvard’s detractors should also stop cloaking their opposition in Harvard’s progressive financial aid provisions. Yes, Harvard’s financial aid policies are commendable, but the Harvard student body is hardly representative of all economic classes. About 70 percent of Harvard students receive financial aid—but 30 percent do not.
Think for a second about how much someone’s family would have to make to not be eligible for financial aid at a place as generous as Harvard. Or better yet, play around with the Net Price Calculator the financial aid office provides on its website. A family of four making $150,000 a year with a $500,000 home and $100,000 in other assets—a family which, according to economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, who have done the definitive work on US income inequality, falls in the top five percent of households in terms of income—gets a $12,750 scholarship.
Thus, at least 30 percent of Harvard students are richer than the top five percent of earners. Harvard does not serve people of all classes equally. It, as higher education expert Richard D. Kahlenberg ’85 told Alec MacGillis in the latter’s prescient Washington Post piece arguing for the occupation of Harvard, “replicates social inequality rather than upends it,” as do other elite institutions.
As MacGillis noted, Harvard’s recruitment process is a big part of this replication process. As any senior could tell you, the on-campus recruitment culture is heavily centered around the financial industry, where students would go to make bets at banks and hedge funds that destabilize the economy as a whole, and the management consulting industry, which charges big companies big fees to find “cost savings” (read: layoffs, and big layoffs, given the cost of hiring the consultants in the first place). This makes sense from Harvard’s perspective; it wants rich alumni to keep its endowment large. But students who want more from their careers and from their university should demand better.
And so we are demanding better, in the Yard, right now. We do not agree with each other on every particular, and I cannot speak for the movement, but we are united in wanting Harvard to truly be a university that serves the 99 percent. The University is resisting, of course, most visibly by requiring IDs to enter campus. This is a very savvy means of turning students against protestors, but the occupiers aren’t the ones blocking gates. The administration is doing that, and can stop at any time. The occupiers are doing nothing more than making our voices heard, one tent at a time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A selection of Crimson editors respond to Wednesday’s night’s Occupy Harvard protest.
Harvard’s Identity Crisis
Occupy Harvard Wednesday night: listening to the booming rhetoric of Timothy P. McCarthy, hearing the stories of two workers who were fired injudiciously, absorbing the feeling that hundreds of people were in order to pursue change. Occupy Harvard the next day: demonized by a significant portion of the student body, complaints about not being able to walk through the Yard, accusations that the protestors were whiny. However, there was nothing whiny about the chants of "Harvard for the 99 percent,” and there was nothing unsubstantiated about "Banks got bailed out/we got sold out."
At Harvard, there is a deep identity crisis that is not dissimilar to that present amongst the American population. As illustrated by the research of Harvard Business School Professor Michael I. Norton, many Americans think income distribution is more equal than it is—and the overwhelming majority of Americans desire income equality at almost Swedish levels. If anything, those complaining about peaceful protestors sharing the voice of the country are the ones truly out of touch with society. The claim that a temporarily obstructed path to Lamont Library is more important than students uniting with the people is the truly unreasonable one.
Christine Ann Hurd ’13 is a Crimson Arts writer.
HMC and Financial Aid
The Occupy Harvard folks say they want a University for the 99 percent, not a corporation for the one percent. Yet, what if high Harvard Management Company salaries are necessary to allow the financial aid office to shell out record-breaking sums to non-wealthy students? Surely, if there is any moral reprehensibility in paying a few hedge fund managers millions of dollars, it is outweighed by our school’s unequaled ability to ensure that everyone who is admitted can afford to attend.
There seem to be two implicit and false notions within the movement. These are that a) Harvard is not doing everything it can to promote socioeconomic diversity on campus and b) Harvard pays HMC employees more than they have to. Considering Harvard’s ever-increasing financial aid packages—especially the fact that any student from a family making less than $65,000/year (well above the median household income) is not expected to contribute any money for tuition—it seems somewhat farcical to suggest that Harvard doesn’t want increased socioeconomic diversity. As for the latter assumption: I find it equally absurd that Harvard would willfully dole out more money to HMC than need be. The response “I’m sure they could pay them less without letting the endowment take a hit” simply doesn’t cut the mustard. If it were true, they’d do it.
Michael F. Cotter ’14 is a Crimson editorial writer.
We are the One Percent
Thus far, I have disagreed with but tolerated the message spread by the Occupy movement. Although I found the emphasis on targeting a small group and blaming one percent of Americans for broad, sweeping societal problems troubling and misguided, it was easy to understand the frustrations that drove the formation of Occupy Wall Street and the proliferation of its message.
However, watching the Occupy movement manifest itself in a swath of tents propped up in Harvard Yard, complete with signs calling for “a University for the 99 percent,” has dumbfounded me. Like it or not, this school will always represent the one percent. Indeed, a student’s presence here is a reflection of the desire to succeed and be elite.
As Harvard students, we are lucky, blessed, and fortunate beyond our wildest dreams to have access to all that a Harvard education offers us, now and into the future. The real 99 percent would kill for the boundless opportunity to succeed that this group of students seems intent on trivializing.
Evan Ribot ’14 is a Crimson editorial writer.
HUPD’s Role
Some have criticized the Harvard University Police Department reaction to the Occupy Harvard movement, pointing to their firm stand against letting protesters into the Yard and their stations at various gates as unnecessary. Indeed, I witnessed protesters yelling “Shame on you” at HUPD officers. However, the officers were simply carrying out their obligation to protect the student body and Harvard community. The antagonism toward them was unnecessary and detracted from the movement’s points. The Yard is a residential area for most freshmen and now, with Harvard students sleeping outdoors, it is especially important to ensure all of their safety. I generally support the Occupy movements, their goals and think they point to some key concerns our country needs to reckon with. However, the attempt by some affiliated with Occupy Harvard to vilify HUPD was uncalled for.
Kathy Wang ’14 is a Crimson editorial writer.
 
 
Mistakes on Both Sides
Observing Occupy Harvard and its multifarious responses has been an extraordinary exercise in evaluating polarizing rhetoric. Occupy Harvard touts Harvard as a fundamentally corrupt institution for the one percent, a perspective that is decidedly dichotomous and downright frightening. That is not to say that Harvard does not have ample room for improvement, but let’s give credit where credit is due: Harvard awards an enormous sum of financial aid to students in need and aggressively seeks to increase its socioeconomic diversity each year. Moreover, as the 180:1 campaign would have us know, the lowest paid Harvard employee earns upwards of $40,000 per year. In other words, the salary of every Harvard service worker is greater than or equal to the US median household income.
Yet critiques of Occupy Harvard are as problematic as the movement’s shortcomings. Occupiers have been disparaged for everything from lacking a coherent agenda to refusing to engage with existing political institutions to inconveniencing pedestrians in Harvard Yard. Such criticisms are wholly and fundamentally misguided: Occupy is cognizant of its refusal to engage with existing institutions, and that is precisely the point. Occupy is not about pushing a singular, unchanging political agenda. It is about transforming the political process. It is about creating a space for non-normative political participation and experimenting with absolute, unyielding democracy. It is about the means much more than the ends. If you don't know that, you haven’t been paying attention.
Marina N. Bolotnikova ’14 is a Crimson editorial writer.
A Student’s Right 
There are certainly lots of valid critiques of Occupy Harvard, but it is absolutely ridiculous to tell Harvard students that they can't critique their university's policies in an effort to promote ethical investment, workers' rights, support of the local community, and more inclusiveness for students of all backgrounds. Sure, being a Harvard student confers immense privilege. That doesn't mean that Harvard students can't work to make their local and global economies more egalitarian and fair. In fact, it means that students here concerned about the increasing gap between the rich and poor in the US have even more responsibility to speak out about Harvard's complicity with fundamentally inequitable systems.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to increase the availability of alcohol-free social activities to undergraduates, the College has allotted a supplementary $3500 of funding to each residential House for non-alcoholic, nighttime weekend events. We applaud the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for implementing a measure that will undoubtedly have a positive impact on undergraduate life—not only will the funding combat widespread alcohol consumption, often in unsafe spaces, by Harvard undergraduates, but it will also address the problem of social space by, as we have suggested in the past, putting Harvard’s abundance of underused social spaces to good use. Nonetheless, we encourage the College to look to other, more effective means of addressing unsafe alcohol consumption in unsafe social space, such as reforming its alcohol policy, if it truly wishes to impact the lives of undergraduates.
The late-night budgetary supplement is very much in keeping with the College’s recent efforts to enhance the availability and popularity of on-campus social spaces. Pforzheimer House recently announced that it its Junior Common Room will undergo significant renovations this year, and Cabot Cafe, opened earlier this year, has since become tremendously popular among Quad residents. It is clear that there is demand for on-campus social venues and activities, and the College’s late-night activity supplement is a natural and much-welcomed component in its revival of on-campus spaces. The popularity of new on-campus social spaces also means that there is an enormous demographic of Harvard students that prefer activities that do not involve alcohol, and we are pleased that the College is expanding social options for these students. On-campus weekend events are also an important step in reestablishing Harvard’s House system as a central component of undergraduate life and as a source of undergraduate unity.
Additionally, the current state of Harvard’s social scene is such that students seeking social events on weekends often find that their only options are parties at off-campus organizations, such as final clubs, which are not accountable to Harvard and from which students do not have immediate access to proctors or tutors. The events funded by the late-night activity supplement are bound to steer many students away from such unsafe spaces, and in this regard, it is a laudable step toward a safer and more egalitarian social atmosphere at Harvard.
Subsidies for alcohol-free weekend events are a positive and necessary measure, but it is crucial to note that expanding these types of social activities alone will not address the problem of dangerous drinking and social space at Harvard. While it is true that many Harvard students enjoy alcohol-free activities, it is equally true that an even greater portion of undergraduates actively seek events that are not institutionally sponsored and at which alcohol is served. The College is correct in targeting unsafe drinking, but it should do so primarily by removing unnecessary obstructions (those that go beyond the scope of Massachusetts law) to drinking in on-campus spaces. To this end, we continue to urge FAS to consider reforming its overbearing alcohol policies, which inadvertently siphon students to off-campus party venues and exacerbate the very problem that they strive to address. Ultimately, a meaningful solution to the twin forces of exclusive social spaces and unsafe drinking must strike at the root of the College’s alcohol policy rather than obscure it with tangential victories.

I was four or five or six when my best friend informed me that wishing had rules. We were sitting on the blacktop surface of our elementary school’s playground, drawing misshapen flowers in colored chalk. The pavement’s ridges left indents in our knees.
“Close your eyes,” Caroline whispered to me as she leaned forward, plucking a stray eyelash off my cheek. She held it out between her thumb and forefinger, her lips breaking into one of those little-kid half smiles: “Gotta make a wish!”
I closed my eyes and thought really hard about what I wanted. What did I want? Maybe, just for today, my mom would pick me up from school, her bags nudging my arm as we walked. Or maybe we would go see the boats on the Hudson River. “Oh just wish already!” (Caroline was the impatient type.)
“Okay, okay,” I said. “I wish my family would move to the country so that I can have a dog.” I looked at her, expectantly. I really, really wanted a dog. Caroline swiveled her head back and forth. “Nuh uh, that’s not how it works. You can’t actually tell me what you wish for.”
Apparently wishing had regulations. Caroline counted them off on her fingers:
1.    It really has to be about important stuff.
2.    No telling.
3.    If you tell, it will never, ever come true.
That day, I went home after school and asked my mom what wishing meant. She gave me some sort of explanation that came out of the Mom Dictionary of Simple Definitions for Ideas You Think Your Kids Can’t Understand. A wish is something special you hope for harder than anything else. Puzzled, I asked her what kinds of things she liked to wish for, but I realized that those were secrets I couldn’t know, wisdom she couldn’t teach me.
I was worried I wasn’t doing it right—wishing for the wrong things, or not wishing hard enough, or wishing and then giving it away. What if I was accidentally revealing too much about the things I wanted in snippets of lunchtime conversation, letting them slip between turns at double dutch? My hopes became intimidating then—but magical too—in their secrecy. They were no longer the small, friendly things I could dream of as I blew apart a dandelion, convincing myself it was okay if it took two tries. A move to the country wasn’t enough.
In search of simplicity, and some sort of grandiose desire deserving of the hype, I began to change my approach to wishing. I needed one thing to place my hopes behind. I didn’t want to spread my wishes thin. Eventually, I decided: this big, existential desire I figured I wanted pretty badly, and was important enough to warrant being kept a secret for my whole life.
I try not to think about all the other wishes out there, all the other people who learned the rules sooner. What insight might they have that I don’t? I can’t help but hope that they will disregard the second premise, even though I know the consequences of the third. So sometimes, when it’s 11:11, or when I find an eyelash, or when I’m standing in front of almost-extinguished birthday candles, I whisper, “make a wish.” I watch my friends’ eyelids press closed, their slow intake of breath, the moment of pause. I am now the impatient one. I almost ask what they’re thinking of, or if they’re wishing for anything at all. Almost.
But you’re not supposed to ask. At least not once you graduate from light up shoes and heavy summer mornings spent dashing through playground sprinklers. The minute passes, the eyelash flutters to the ground, the candle flames disappear into wisps of smoke. You don’t stand up to ask what they wish for, because wishes are secrets and secrets are never to be told.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What does Occupy Wall Street have to do with Harvard women’s basketball?
Add to the mix 2011 graduate Jackie Alemany, and the answer becomes much clearer. On Oct. 25, the former Crimson co-captain and guard published a blog entry for the Huffington Post relating the fashion industry and the Occupy Wall Street movement—not bad for someone mere months out of college.
In fact, all four 2011 graduates of the women’s basketball squad—Alemany, Emma Markley, Christine Matera, and Claire Wheeler—are making some pretty impressive strides out in the “real world,” and in light of their basketball careers, their successes hardly seem surprising.
“[Alemany] had a lot of fight in her,” says Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “She had a non-traditional way of getting things done on the floor, probably because she was so competitive.”
Considering the political spin on fashion in her first HuffPo entry, one could say that Alemany’s nontraditional ways have continued.
“I don’t want to limit myself to fashion,” says Alemany of her desire to eventually transition into journalism. “But when it presents itself in a political context, I really love to write about it.”
For the time being, Alemany says that she will blog about once a month. She notes that the job, which she set up after meeting Arianna Huffington at a dinner, is a great creative outlet that complements her job as a consultant for MasterCard in New York.
“I really enjoy the job,” Alemany says, “but I needed a creative outlet that I was lacking.”
Also in New York is Markley, a former forward who averaged 12.7 points and 5.9 rebounds per game in her senior season.
“The kind of offense that [Markley] had—you don’t teach that; you just enjoy it,” Delaney-Smith says.
Markley was undoubtedly an enormous presence on the court, but she is making herself known in other arenas as well. The Yorktown Heights, N.Y. native is now working for Digitas as an analyst on the research strategy and analytics team, focusing on Kraft advertisements in particular.
“I have a lot of fun,” says Markley of her job. “It’s a great work environment, and I’m learning a lot.”
As far as future goals go, she is refreshingly open.
“I’m at the point where I’m testing things out and seeing what I do like and what I don’t like,” she comments.
Working on a rather different project is Matera, a former two-time co-captain whose leadership will be heavily missed, according to Delaney-Smith.
With hopes of someday practicing medicine, Matera is working as a research assistant at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She’s concurrently studying biochemistry through Harvard’s Extension School, making for a pretty full workload.
But Matera feels that basketball has given her an added advantage.
“Basketball has prepared me for being disciplined,” Matera says. “It was probably harder being a Division I player at one of the top schools in the country [than it is now].”
Also interesting is the way Matera became involved in HIV research. Rather than through a former professor or teaching fellow, Matera says the connection was through none other than the Crimson basketball program.
“It was through my assistant coach, [Kelly Finley],” Matera explains. “She used to babysit for a doctor that works at the Brigham … and she introduced me to [the doctor].”
As a result, Matera now works with the very same doctor. She says that she plans to stick with the research for another year or two and then segue into medical school.
Also planning on returning to school is Wheeler, who co-captained the squad alongside Matera during her junior season. Of the former forward, Delaney-Smith says that despite an injury-ridden career that often left the athlete on the bench, Wheeler left a mark on the program that will not be soon forgotten.
“A lot of players in the program still talk about Claire’s mentorship,” Delaney-Smith affirms.
Post-college, Wheeler is working on Capitol Hill through a one-year fellowship for NETWORK Catholic Social Justice Lobby. As a lobby associate, she says that she meets with congressional staff to discuss economic justice issues; she also examines the effects of congressional budget decisions on low-income families.
But come July 31, 2012—when the fellowship ends—Wheeler will be focusing her attention elsewhere.
“I’m applying to law school for [2012],” Wheeler explains. “I’d like to go into public interest law of some sort.”
Her interests seem natural in light of her past work; the Silver Spring, Md. native spent five months as a research assistant studying the interaction of race, genetics, and public policy.
But perhaps her most formative experience was a summer in Ecuador with WorldTeach.
“This experience really solidified my decision to follow a service-oriented, public interest career path,” she says.
All in all, not too shabby for some brand-new college graduates. It shall be interesting to see what paths current co-captains Brogan Berry and Lindsay Louie embark upon after the 2012 graduation rolls around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since arriving at Harvard in 2007, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker has transformed the men’s basketball team from an Ivy League cellar-dweller into the winningest squad in the program’s history.
After posting an 8-22 record in his first season, Amaker and his teams have improved each year of his tenure, the last two of which were the most successful in the Crimson’s history.
But Amaker is no stranger to winning.
As a player and coach at Duke University, Amaker went to the NCAA Tournament a combined 12 times, winning the national championship twice as an assistant coach.
After his time in Durham, N.C., Amaker moved from the ACC to the Big East where he was hired as head coach at Seton Hall. In four years with the Pirates, Amaker brought Seton Hall to three NITs and one NCAA Tournament in 2000.
That year, the Pirates, led by former NBA player Eddie Griffin, reached the Sweet 16 before eventually falling to Oklahoma State.
In 2001, Amaker took over a Michigan basketball program still reeling from scandals from the previous decade. The team improved under Amaker, going from 11-18 in his first season to 22-13 in his final year, but its failure to qualify for an NCAA Tournament resulted in his firing.
In 2007, Amaker joined the Crimson, taking over for former head coach Frank Sullivan.
Since arriving in Cambridge, Amaker has posted a 66-50 overall record and 31-25 conference record.
Last season was his most succesfull with the Crimson, as he guided Harvard to a share of its first-ever Ivy League title. But once again, his squad was unable to earn a March Madness bid after giving up a heartbreaking buzzer-beater in the Crimson’s one-game playoff against Princeton. Harvard was forced to settle for its first NIT berth in program history.
Amaker’s recent success caught the eyes of some outside programs. Last spring, the University of Miami made a special trip to recruit Amaker to fill its coaching vacancy, but Amaker declined the offer.
With Amaker still in Cambridge, the Harvard coach is currently the second longest continuously tenured coach in the Ivy League. And now entering his fifth season, Amaker seems poised to make a return to March Madness.

The Harvard men’s basketball season may have ended abruptly last year, but at Lavietes Pavilion, the team could not be beat. The squad ended the season by defeating Princeton, a win that  marked the Crimson’s 17th straight win at home—a run dating back to the 2009-2010 season. The streak is good for the 10th-best in the country in Division I ball.
Although this home-court advantage is fairly new, the home court isn’t. Lavietes opened in 1926 and is the second oldest arena used in college basketball.
In 1981, the Gordon Track and Tennis Center opened, allowing Lavietes to replace the Malkin Athletic Center as the home of Crimson basketball. It hosted its first basketball game on Nov. 26, 1982, a women’s game against the University of Chicago. The men’s team defeated MIT the next day. On March 2, 1996, the court was dedicated to Ray Lavietes ’36, a two-time letter winner for the basketball team.
Here’s a rundown of the rest of the Ivy League’s home courts:
The Brown Bears play in the Pizzitola Sports Center, the lobby of which is named after legendary alum John Heisman.
Francis S. Levien Gymnasium is the home court of the Columbia Lions, having replaced the old University Gym in 1974.
Home to the Cornell Big Red is Newman Arena, which opened in 1990. The 4,473-seater has hosted the Harlem Globetrotters.
The home court of the Dartmouth Big Green is the 2,100-seat Leede Arena, named after one of Dartmouth’s all-time leading scorers, Edward Leede ’49.
The Penn Quakers play in the Palestra, which opened in 1927 and is the most famous gym in the league. Considered to be the birthplace of college basketball, the Palestra has hosted more games, teams, and NCAA Tournaments than any other arena.
The Princeton Tigers play in 42 year-old Jadwin Gymnasium, a 250,000-square-foot-surface that has enough space for eight football fields. The Princeton cheering section is dubbed the “Jadwin Jungle.”
Finally, the John J. Lee Amphitheater houses the Yale Bulldogs. This court is one part of the gothic Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-oldest gym in the world—constructed only six years after Lavietes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captain Brogan Berry currently has her eyes set on Princeton, Yale, and the rest of the Ivy League. But a year from now, she could be preparing for Bourges, Rivas Ecopolis, or Taranto. Whether she decides to play in France, Spain, or Italy, Berry hopes to play professionally overseas after she graduates from Harvard.
Doing so has become a trend for Harvard women’s basketball players over the past few years, as Berry hopes to follow in the most recent footsteps of former teammates Emily Tay ’09 and Katie Rollins ’09.  Current assistant coach Lindsay Hallion ’08 also played overseas after graduation.
“I know a couple of my past teammates who have gone over there, and some have really enjoyed their experience while some have not had as a good experience,” Berry says. “It is something I want to try out for myself.”
The trend has become a self-sustaining one, as Crimson basketball players with no prior professional aspirations have seen teammates take this next step and have become intrigued themselves. And when it comes time to make a decision, a network of experienced alumni has only helped players in their endeavors.
“With the culture of this program, they know they can [play overseas],” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says.
Berry herself didn’t consider overseas ball seriously until her sophomore year at Harvard, after witnessing other teammates pursuing the career.
“Coming into Harvard as a freshman, I definitely never really considered it,” Berry says. “But seeing players in the past three years has made me realize my passion and love for the game, and it definitely opened my eyes to the possibilities of a great experience.”
For many, playing professional ball overseas has been a short-term decision, a transition year or two until entering the “real” world.
When Rollins was about to enter the real world, the economy was at a low point, and the job market was not too appealing. That influenced Rollins’ decision to join TSV Amicitia Viernheim of Germany, along with her Pforzheimer roommate Tay.
“It’s something I never even thought about doing,” Rollins says. “The opportunity presented itself right after the season, and I knew I could play at the next level—it was just a matter of if I wanted to.”
Despite being somewhat burnt out after four hard years playing Division I ball, Rollins decided the opportunity was too great to pass up.
“But I felt like, who am I not to embrace this opportunity?” she says.  “I kind of thought, when I’m 30 or 40 looking back and I don’t take this chance, then I’ll probably regret it forever.”
After a year abroad, all expenses paid, Rollins decided to move on, having gained a cultural experience and ready to look for more conventional career path.
But whereas many like Rollins have used basketball as tool to get overseas, some, like Tay, have pursued this opportunity more for the basketball itself.
Tay, who is featured in the recent documentary “No Look Pass,” is still playing in Germany.
Besides missing her family and “good sushi,” Tay believes playing overseas is definitely a worthwhile experience.
“I would definitely recommend playing in Europe,” Tay says. “I’m having a great time. It’s not for everyone, but I would recommend everyone to try it for a year.”
According to Rollins, Tay may be also ready to look elsewhere for a career as she enters her third year in Europe with a full-time job at an American military base.
Another former Harvard standout, Allison Feaster ’98, currently plays in Spain after spending 10 years in the WNBA.
So as Berry weighs her options, she will look towards these players for advice, having already been in touch with many of them.
“Reaching out to the past Harvard alumni has been a huge help,” Berry says. “I would really like to pursue a career, just go for the experience, and try out something new.”
Right now, she would like to have an experience more like Rollins’ that serves as a transitional period.
But Berry is open to the possibility of continuing the dream and indefinitely postponing that entrance into the real world.
“You never know,” she says. “If I have a great experience, it could always go for longer.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ray Allen, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett—and now, Keith Wright. While all play for Massachusetts-based basketball teams, they now have one more thing in common: all have been influenced by Brian Adams.
In June of this year, Adams joined the Harvard men’s basketball program as an assistant coach, filling the void left by former assistant Kenny Blakeney. Prior to joining the Crimson’s staff, Adams was involved with multiple NBA teams. For the New York Knicks, he was the organization’s intern for basketball operations. Most recently, Adams spent the last five years working for the Boston Celtics, four of them as video coordinator.
“He has an energetic, young, enthusiastic mind for basketball,” head coach Tommy Amaker says. “He is going to bring a wealth of experience from [the Celtics], that incredible first class organization and franchise, of how they did things, how the organization was run … He has been an incredible resource for our guys.”
As video coordinator, Adams’s responsibilities included creating scouting videos on opposing teams and editing film from Celtics’ games. As NBA fans will realize, his time with the organization overlapped with its 17th title—earning him his own championship ring.
“I think the only time I see [the championship ring] is when we have recruits come up and he flashes it just to remind them where he came from,” co-captain Oliver McNally says with a smile. “All jokes aside, it’s pretty special. That’s essentially an assistant coach on an NBA championship team.”
Even before the season’s tipoff, Adams has already impacted the Crimson. His connections with the NBA have led him to help his new players in ways that would not have been possible for most college assistant coaches.
“He’s showed us all types of pick-and-rolls—Dwayne Wade, Miami Heat stuff,” junior forward Christian Webster says. “He gives us different game tapes of different players we like. [Junior forward Kyle Casey] got a Carmelo [Anthony] tape, and [sophomore guard Laurent Rivard] and I got a lot of shooting tapes. He actually gave me a Ray Allen shooting workout.”
While his wealth of experience is undeniable, Amaker revealed the true reason for Adams’ hire.
“When he interviewed for the position and wanted to come on board here, he promised me that he would bring Kevin Garnett over here,” Amaker says. “I was teasing him, but it is big. Let’s not kid ourselves … the highest thing we could do in the world of basketball is play in the NBA, and to have someone who has that experience right now … and is interested in being a part of this program, coming from that organization, is very meaningful for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second straight season, Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has added a top-100 recruit.
Recent Harvard commit Shilpa Tummala, a 5’11 guard from St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix, Ariz., is listed by ESPN as the 68th-best overall player and the 28th-best guard in the nation.
Next year, Tummala will join highly-touted freshman forward Temi Fagbenle, who stood at the 13th spot in ESPN’s top-100 listing for the class of 2015.
Fagbenle, originally from London, played at Blair Academy in New Jersey and earned state player of the year honors while also leading her England team to a win in the U18 European women’s basketball championship in 2010.
Tummala led her high school team to a state championship in 2011 and made the all-state team as a junior. Her other suitors included perennial NCAA tournament contenders Cal, Georgetown, and USC.
In the end, the high-profile Arizonan chose Harvard because of strong relationships she built with the coaches and her faith in the program.
“I truly believe in the system that the coach has [in place at Harvard], and I think that we can go to the NCAA Tournament all four years that I’m there,” Tummala says.
Delaney-Smith credits the Crimson’s recent success in landing such talented players to her recruiting coordinator, Kelly Finley.
“She knows everybody,” Delaney-Smith says of Finley. “Kelly has a wide national network that has helped her immensely.”
Finley’s job is a challenging one—to identify basketball prospects that also have the academic caliber to gain admission to Harvard.
“Recruiting at the top echelon is really difficult for this school,” Delaney-Smith remarks.
Other universities have begun to host talented athletes on campus as early as their sophomore year of high school.
“That’s almost a big waste of time for us because we don’t have academic information on these kids yet,” Delaney-Smith says.
Delaney-Smith says that all pieces of the admissions puzzle have worked out for these recent recruits. The Arizona native Tummala is the top student in her high school class, and the rookie Fagbenle boasted a 3.4 GPA in high school.
Tummala brings academic ambition, hoping to follow in her parents’ footsteps—both are doctors—and study biomedical engineering while at Harvard before continuing her education in medical school.
For Tummala, basketball runs in the family. Her brother Sai is a freshman forward on the University of Michigan basketball team—former home of Harvard men’s coach Tommy Amaker.
Tummala is well-suited to succeed at Harvard, but the Arizona standout still needs to change one thing before she arrives in Cambridge.
“For the winter?” she says, laughing. “I think I’m going to need a new wardrobe completely.”
While Delaney-Smith is thrilled to have much-hyped recruits like Fagbenle and Tummala donning Crimson jerseys, she knows that she must continue to strengthen the program.
“You have to keep getting them,” says Delaney-Smith of the top recruits. “Otherwise, you’re a flash in the pan.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Highlighted by a trip to the Bahamas during Thanksgiving, Harvard will travel extensively this upcoming basketball season. And the Crimson could venture on even more road trips if it makes history with a bid to March Madness.
But the first bounce of the ball will occur in the squad’s own backyard against MIT tonight.
Now that baseball season is over and the prospects of a lengthy NBA season grow less likely by the day, the attention of the Boston sports world can turn to the area’s strong college basketball scene.
Four of the Crimson’s neighbors—Boston University, Boston College, Holy Cross, and the Division III Engineers—are on Harvard’s schedule this upcoming season.
Coach Tommy Amaker’s current senior class is 10-1 against these schools, including three straight wins against Boston College and Holy Cross and two straight wins against Boston University and MIT.
The Crimson’s recent success against teams from the Boston area is only overshadowed by its success at Lavietes Pavilion, where Harvard has compiled a 25-2 record over the past two seasons.
The Crimson appears poised to remain the aggressors in the area again this year.
Boston College is in a re-building phase after losing 10 players from last year’s roster.
Boston University has lost one of the key pieces to its puzzle, including Jake O’Brien, who was forced to have a second surgery on his left foot.  A statistical leader for the Terriers, O’Brien averaged 13.8 points and 6.4 rebounds for the team as a sophomore.
At the bottom of the pack is Holy Cross, which has not had a winning record in the Patriot League for the past two seasons.
MIT, albeit successful, competes in Division III.
According to ESPN’s Andy Katz, “The total number of media members in attendance [for Harvard during a Boston-area media day in late October] far surpassed the five other Division I schools in the state of Massachusetts.”
Despite its dominating presence in the local basketball scene, the Crimson does not have the same natural ties to Boston as do some of its competitors.
Only three Harvard players, sophomore forward Tom Hamel, junior forward Kyle Casey, and senior forward Andrew Van Nest, are actually from Massachusetts.
“We might not be from Boston or the Massachusetts area,” co-captain guard Oliver McNally says, “but now we kind of take pride in that we’ve been the better team around here, and we’ve won a lot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team is a program built on a history of success. With 11 Ivy League titles to its name, the team knows the road to a championship is never easy. But for the first time in over a decade, the Crimson will return to Lavietes Pavilion without a single player who has won a championship ring.
The most recent successes in the Ancient Eight have been dominated by Princeton. Over the past two years, the Tigers have gone 27-1 in Ivy League competition, with Harvard dealing Princeton its only conference loss last season.
After snagging two consecutive conference crowns, Princeton is the favorite to complete a three-peat, receiving 14 out of 17 first place votes in the preseason media poll, while the Crimson won the other three votes.
“What Princeton had last year was a team full of women who believed they could win,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says. “That [belief] speaks volumes.”
With only one graduating starter, Princeton looks poised to continue the success that earned it a 24-5 record last year and a berth in the NCAA tournament.
Leading the Tigers is senior guard Lauren Edwards. The four-year starter and two-time All-Ivy League selection comes into her senior season with 982 career points and will soon join the elite 1,000-point club. Edwards averaged 11.4 points and two assists per game last season. Fellow All-Ivy selection Devona Allgood will help Edwards offensively. The senior center contributed 11.9 points a game and led the Ancient Eight in rebounds per game with 7.2.
Princeton balances its strong offense with solid defensive play from Defensive Player of the Year Lauren Polansky. The junior guard produced 52 steals and 116 rebounds for the Tigers last season.
Rounding out Princeton’s starting five is former Rookie of the Year Niveen Rasheed, who returns for her junior season after a knee injury kept her on the bench for Ivy League competition last season.
“I’ve always thought Rasheed was a good player,” Delaney-Smith says. “But she is coming off of an ACL injury, so I don’t know [what to expect].”
Although this Princeton team seems very similar to the previous one, it loses Addie Micir, the unanimous Ivy League Player of the Year, to graduation. Micir, who scored 1,188 points over her career, provided Delaney-Smith with a big challenge last year.
“Even though [Princeton lost] only one player, [Micir] was huge for them,” Delaney-Smith says. “[Micir was challenging] in the attention she commanded because she was probably one of the best shooters in the country. That changes the format of the floor.”
Additionally, Delaney-Smith believes the dynamic of the Tigers’ team has changed significantly since last season.
“[Princeton] lost some veteran seniors that I felt complemented the young, talented kids on the floor,” Delaney-Smith says. “They are not going to have that same dynamic.”
Delaney-Smith believes Harvard has the personnel to match up with Princeton’s squad but also notes that the Tigers’ experience and championship mentality make them a tough squad to beat.
“Princeton has that belief in themselves,” Delaney-Smith says. “But we believe in ourselves, too.”

Freshmen aren’t the only new talent the Harvard women’s basketball team picked up for its upcoming season.
Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has also recruited Lindsay Hallion ’08 and Juanise Cornell as new assistant coaches.  Though it is the first year of coaching for both, they bring impressive resumes to their new positions.
Hallion played for Harvard from 2004-2008, serving as co-captain her senior season.
“It’s probably one of my greatest joys just to be able to [recruit] players and student-athletes that I love, that I respect, and that have the passion not only for basketball but also [for]the program, that Lindsay Hallion has,” Delaney–Smith notes.
Hallion’s play on the court earned her the most valuable player award for the Crimson as well as second-team all Ivy League honors in 2007 and 2008.  She was elected to the ESPN the Magazine Academic All-District second team and earned the Harvard Pride Award her senior year.
After graduation, Hallion worked for the FBI in criminal investigation and played basketball professionally in Europe.
“[Working for the FBI] was awesome … it’s a great organization and a great place to work,” Hallion says.
Although Delaney–Smith felt that Hallion would have been a good choice for an assistant coach all along, she thought Hallion should obtain some real-world experience before deciding on coaching as a profession.
“I had an [job] opening [before], and I thought hard about hiring Lindsay the first time around, but I just felt she needed a year of experience, no matter what it was,” Delaney-Smith says.  “I think it’s great that she has both the FBI and the European experience.”
Hallion agreed with Delaney-Smith’s sentiments about taking time off before returning to the Crimson.
“The lessons I learned playing basketball in college and playing for [Delaney-Smith] definitely prepared me for the real world, [and] the professional world,” Haillon says. “But I think it was important for me to have that gap before coming back to basketball.”
In addition to coaching Harvard women’s basketball, Hallion is currently the assistant athletic director at Westwood High School, her alma mater and where Delaney-Smith made her name as a high school coach.
Current Crimson assistant coach Kelly Finley brought Cornell to Delaney-Smith’s attention during her search. Finley and Cornell were teammates at Colorado State.
“Kelly had mentioned [Cornell] to me, and then I researched her,” Delaney-Smith says. “[She] got rave reviews from everyone I spoke with,”
Delaney-Smith considers Cornell’s experience playing in a different area of the country—in addition to playing at two colleges—as bringing a fresh perspective.
“She was a very good player at Colorado State and graduated at Colorado Christian, so she’s seen the whole network and different approaches to the game,” Delaney-Smith says.
While at Colorado Christian University, Cornell led the team in scoring, averaging 16.5 points per game. Cornell’s presence helped the Cougars win the Rocky Mountain Conference Championship, which contributed to her Central Region Player of the Year award in 2010.
“Anytime we can get an experience that is different from here, it’s always quite valuable,” Delaney-Smith says.
Cornell says the transition from player to coach in a short period of time is a challenge, but one that she is ready to take on.
“Being a player, you’re used to people telling you what to do and just doing it without question,” Cornell says.  “As a coach, you have to start thinking about each player individually. It’s a different type of care.  For me, especially with the kids at Harvard, they’re so driven and they’re so knowledgeable about basketball, that it makes [the transition] a lot easier, so I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the 2011-12 Harvard men’s basketball team is on the threshold of yet another breakthrough season, former Crimson guard Jeremy Lin ’10 is finding ways to pass the time amidst a historic NBA lockout.
Lin graduated from 2010 with a degree in economics, but rather than signing with J.P. Morgan or Bain like many of his peers, the undrafted 6’3 guard joined the Golden State Warriors.
By signing a contract with the Warriors in July 2010, Lin became the first NBA player of Chinese-American descent to play in the NBA—and the first Harvard graduate to do so since 1953.
Lin had a modest debut season with Golden State, appearing in 29 games while averaging 2.5 points, 1.2 rebounds, and 1.5 assists in just less than 10 minutes per game last season.
His experience included stints in the NBA Development League, where Lin was given an opportunity to evolve his game and adjust to professional play with the Reno Bighorns.
The rookie was first demoted to the Bighorns on Dec. 28, 2010, after appearing in 17 Warrior games. Lin responded by averaging 18 points over four games in the D-League before being recalled to the Golden State bench.
He was named to the NBA D-League Showcase First Team on Jan. 15, and in the showcase, Lin dazzled.
He started eight of the 12 games, led the league in points with a 17.9 average and logged 5.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists in 32.9 minutes per game.
Lin displayed that potential this past weekend in non-league play. Former Warrior and Bay Area native Matt Barnes organized a “We Believe vs. Dub Charity Basketball Game” on Nov. 6 at the San Jose Center, in which Lin took part. Alongside Warriors of old and new, the guard gave basketball fans a much-needed taste of professional hoops in the thick of the lockout void.
Lin—with Golden State teammates Stephen Curry, Charlie Bell, Lou Amundson, Dorell Wright, and David Lee—composed the “Dub” team and took on members of the memorable 2007 “We Believe” team, which included Barnes, Al Harrington, Antawn Jamison, C.J. Watson, and Anthony Morrow.
While both teams’ defensive efforts left much to be desired in the prolific 158-153 contest, Lin put up a solid 24 points for the current Warriors squad in front of over 4,000 Golden State fans to contribute to the  victory.
The charity game provided a preview of what Lin has been working on in the off-season. When the labor dispute finally ends, Lin is poised to be the first guard off the Golden State bench.
The Warriors will need the Harvard grad to step up in a big way in order to take some weight off the shoulders of his backcourt mates, Curry and Monta Ellis.
One can now find Lin’s Golden State jersey proudly displayed in the lounge of Harvard’s own Lavietes Pavilion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixty-six years ago, the Harvard men’s basketball team was selected to represent New England in the NCAA Tournament at Madison Square Garden.
In the 1945-1946 edition of the Dance, the Crimson was knocked out by Ohio State, 46-38, in the first round, and lost its consolation matchup to NYU, 67-61, to finish the season 19-3.
Though the tournament now welcomes 68 teams as opposed to eight, Harvard has never returned to the promised land of March Madness.
The journey to the top for the 1946 Crimson was a remarkable one, the likes of which may never be seen again in college basketball.
It involved a Buckeye, two Celtics, and a world war. Its main protagonists were named Floyd, Wyndol, and Saul, and it came during a time when the NBA didn’t yet exist.
THE NAVAL REVIVAL
As World War II raged on, Harvard went a combined 4-25 on the basketball court in 1944 and 1945.
With the draft forcing many of the country’s best minds and talents into enlistment, the U.S. Navy initiated the V-12 Navy College Training Program, enrolling more than 125,000 enlistees in universities nationwide.
The reasoning behind the program was that these young men could better serve the nation as educated officers than as enlisted men. Naturally, there were fringe benefits for the armed forces as well. A look at the athletic histories of the Naval Academy at Annapolis and the USMA at West Point exemplifies that point: Army won the national championship in football in 1944 and 1945 (World War II), and finished in the top 10 in the early ’50s (during the Korean War).  Navy similarly dominated on the gridiron during World War II and Vietnam.
With the Crimson struggling on the hardwood, avid basketball fan and Harvard Navy ROTC Commander Walter Mundorf saw an opportunity. Rumor has it that Mundorf, using his connections across the V-12 program, began a massive recruiting program in which he petitioned for the best available V-12 basketball talents to be transferred to Cambridge, Mass.
The results were incredible. Wyndol Gray, a first-team All-American from Bowling Green, brought his 22.3 points per game to the northeast and became, according to a 1946 Boston Globe article, “the most phenomenal shooter to play in New England and surely the best to ever wear a Harvard uniform.”
Paul W. Champion, a 24 year-old veteran of the War in the Pacific, co-captained the Crimson with Gray. Four of the five starters were V-12 recruits of Mundorf’s and the fifth, Saul Mariaschin ’47, transferred of his own accord from Syracuse after returning from the war.
THE MAN BEHIND THE MADNESS
It was a long and winding road that brought Crimson coach Floyd Stahl to the sideline in Madison Square Garden on March 21, 1946.
He began his coaching career at the Ohio State University as the head baseball coach and offensive-line coach for the football team.
He then was hired by Harvard in 1939 to coach baseball, a position he held for seven years with mixed results, finishing with a career record of 54-69.
In 1943, he agreed to take on the Crimson basketball team, despite having no experience coaching the sport.
Stahl’s learning on the job and hands-off approach led to the aforementioned struggles his first few seasons at the helm. But, according to the Harvard Class Album of 1946, Stahl was perfectly suited for the skilled and experienced ’46 team.
“These boys had played a lot of ball at other schools and knew the game backwards,” the album says. “There was little a coach could teach them and this was fine for Stahl who had always let his players do a great deal of their own coaching anyway. All they needed was to practice and play together to become a great team.”
And become great they did. The Crimson tore through the season, going 19-1 behind an All-American campaign from Gray and an all-conference performance by Mariaschin.
Its lone loss came to Holy Cross, a game in which Mariaschin was injured early in the first half and the man he would have been guarding scored a last minute lay-up to defeat Harvard by two.
The Crimson’s dominance of New England was well understood and appreciated by locals. With no professional game existing—the NBA would be created in the summer of 1946—Harvard was the toast of the town, and a late-season matchup with Yale was played in front of a sold-out crowd in the Boston Arena.
“Our team at Harvard in 1945-46 was the very best in its history,” Mariaschin said at his class’ 25th Anniversary. “That athletic accomplishment was very significant to me and everyone on the team.”
MADISON SQUARE GARDEN
Once the Crimson graduated from beating up on future Ivy League teams— the Ancient Eight did not exist until 1954—it boarded a bus for the Big Apple. The tournament format differed greatly from today’s, with only eight teams being invited to participate. Harvard, NYU, Ohio State and North Carolina represented the East, while Baylor, California, Colorado and eventual-champion Oklahoma A&M (now Oklahoma State) represented the West.
Perhaps due to the shine of the spotlight or the more talented competition, the Crimson played a sloppy two games, finishing last in the East bracket and returning to Cambridge winless.
“I will never forget those games at the Garden,” guard John W. Gantt ’47 said in his 25th Anniversary Report. “As the years have passed and my athletic career is now behind me, these are the memories that will always stick with me.”
BOSTON BOYS
After bowing out in New York, Gray left Harvard and was drafted in the first-ever NBA draft, joining the Boston Celtics. He played one season there, averaging 6.5 points per game, before bouncing around with the St. Louis Bombers and Providence Steamrollers. Gray passed away in 1994, but not before being inducted into the Bowling Green Hall of Fame.
Despite losing Gray and the other V-12 players, Mariaschin returned to captain the 1946-47 team to a 16-9 season, a mark the Crimson would not reach again until 1957-58. After graduation Mariaschin became the first Harvard grad to be drafted by an NBA team (Gray did not graduate), playing two seasons with the Celtics and averaging 7.7 points per game.
Despite being offered a long-term contract, Mariaschin decided to leave basketball, change his last name to Marsch, and move out west to California. Had he signed the deal, he would have been under contract through 1951. In 1950, the Celtics hired Red Auerbach as coach, and Auerbach would lead the Celtics to 16 NBA championships.
Mariaschin was inducted into the Harvard Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1980.
Ed Smith ’53 and Jeremy Lin ‘10 are the only Harvard graduates since Mariaschin to play in an NBA game.
A SHORT-LIVED LEGACY
In the 65 years since the Crimson’s last NCAA appearance, it has had just 16 winning seasons. Last year, Harvard was a Douglas Davis jumper away from breaking the NCAA drought. Despite there being more than half a century of frustration looming over the program, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker doesn’t think the pressure of the ’46 campaign effects today’s players.
“They’re anywhere from 18 to 22 [years old], and they’re still trying to figure out Expos, Psych class, Economics, and represent Harvard and play games here,” Amaker said. “I doubt very seriously that it has an impact on them. I’m sure they know that it’s been a long time since [Harvard has] been able to do that. They’re aware of that, they’ve been told that many times.”
But Harvard is a place very much dedicated to tradition, a place that just celebrated its 375th birthday and where there are no classes before 9 a.m. to accommodate students attending chapel seven days a week. As Amaker looks to establish his own unconventional basketball tradition, he need only look to the Crimson’s past for inspiration.
“I was in contact with one of the players from that team,” Amaker said. “That was a neat thing, a neat experience for me. It was great to hear how excited he was with where we’re going as a program. The heights we’ve reached and hope to reach.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has boasted among its ranks coaches who have made profound, indelible changes in the history of college athletics. There’s Harold Ulen, who, starting in 1929, developed a winning men’s swimming program over his 30-year tenure. John “Jack” Barnaby spent 40 years in charge of the men’s and women’s squash programs and trained some of the game’s greatest players. In his 30 seasons as head coach of the track and field program, William McCurdy racked up 445 wins and was considered one of the great instructors of his age. And nobody can forget legendary crew coach Harry Parker, who, after his appointment in 1961, has won numerous national championships and has raised Harvard crew into the highest echelon of sporting excellence.
In this 2011-2012 season, another Crimson coach will join the ranks of these dedicated mentors. Kathy Delaney-Smith enters her 30th season at the helm of the Harvard women’s basketball program as the winningest Ivy League women’s coach in history with a 456-319 overall record. Delaney-Smith is second in Ivy League victories with 274 (legendary former Princeton men’s basketball coach Pete Carril holds the top mark with 315 in 29 years). She has coached nine 20-win seasons and her teams have posted records of .500 or better in 22 of the last 23 years.
Delaney-Smith has many impressive numbers to her name, but the one  that matters the most to the coach is the 11 Ivy League titles that Harvard has won in its history, all under her guidance.
“All the titles are big successes,” Delaney-Smith says. “Every time we can win an Ivy League title, I feel terrific about that. I think the first title was the easiest, and then they get progressively harder after that. ... It’s easier to get to the top than it is to stay on the top. Anyone that can stay on the top, hats off to those people.”
The Massachusetts native has made sure that Harvard contends for the title every year. After her appointment in the 1983 season, Delaney-Smith has never had a title drought longer than four years and has specifically enjoyed much success in the last decade, winning five of her titles during that span. Under her guidance, the Crimson women’s basketball program has qualified for the NCAA Tournament six times and the NIT Tournament twice.
But if Delaney-Smith had her way in the early 70’s, all of this would have never happened.
UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY
Originally passionate about swimming, Delaney-Smith was forced to train the basketball team when her school’s superintendent added that stipulation to the terms of her dream job as a teacher and swimming instructor. The future Harvard and USA national team coach had played basketball in high school under the tutelage of her mother, Peg Delaney, but was thrust into a coaching role without much experience.
“I didn’t want to be a basketball coach,” Delaney-Smith recalls. “I wanted to be a swim coach, believe or not. I did not play in college, which is unusual for someone [who coaches basketball]. It’s a very unusual career path. I [grew to love] coaching basketball, so I retired from swimming. Then the rest is history, and here I am.”
Delaney-Smith went on to accumulate a 204-31 record at Westwood High School, a feat that opened up several coaching opportunities and eventually led to her position at Lavietes Pavilion.
But despite an impressive career at the high school level, Delaney-Smith always felt like there was something left to learn.
“I did not have a lot of knowledge, so I had a lot of people that were questioning why I had success, and maybe I really wasn’t that good of a coach,” Delaney-Smith recalls. “I would read book after book after book, and I would go to every conference I could go to to learn the game.
“Honestly, I had no right being a Division I head coach because I didn’t play in college, and I didn’t ever coach at the college level. Jack Reardon was the athletic director [at the time], and he took a chance on me, I guess.”
That chance paid off. After three seasons, the Crimson women were lifting the first Ancient Eight trophy in the program’s history. Two seasons later, they would win it again.
Delaney-Smith had begun to establish a tradition of excellence that only grew in the coming decades.
CARDINAL RULE: BELIEF
The 90’s were a period of big gains for the continually evolving coach. The 1994-1995 season saw the emergence of freshman Allison Feaster ’98, who forever impacted the Harvard program. Feaster averaged 17 points per game in her first year and helped her team finish in second place in the Ivy League. Unsurprisingly, she captured the league’s Rookie of the Year honor in the process. In the next three seasons, Feaster helped the Crimson win the Ivy League title each year and won the league’s highest individual honor every time.
She is the first Ivy League player ever—man or woman—to win Rookie of the Year and, subsequently, three Player of the Year awards.
Feaster finished her Crimson career averaging a double-double (21 points, 10 rebounds) and was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Sparks in 1998. The forward played 10 years in the WNBA before moving to Europe.
“Allison Feaster was one of the once-in-a-lifetime kind of players that makes coaches better,” Delaney-Smith says. “I always joke that I taught her everything she knows, but we all know that’s not true.”
There’s at least one person that disagrees with that statement.
“After my mother, [Delaney-Smith] is the woman that has had the most influence on my adult life,” says Feaster, who is currently playing in Spain. “I would have to give ‘KDS’ much of the credit for ‘raising me’ after my arrival at Harvard.  I hold ‘KDS’ in the highest regard as a coach and as a person. She taught me important life tools both on and off the court. The woman, the player, and the leader that I am today, I owe much of that to ‘KDS.’”
Perhaps the greatest moment in Delaney-Smith’s coaching career came in the final year of the Feaster era. In the 1997-1998 campaign, Harvard won the Ivy League title for the third straight time and was a No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament. This seeding pitted the Crimson against mighty No. 1 Stanford, who was and still is coached by Hall of Famer Tara VanDerveer. Unsurprisingly, the media and fans began writing off Harvard because of the stigmas that come with playing in the Ivy League.
“We weren’t getting the national respect we deserved,” Delaney-Smith remembers. “When we were getting ready for the tournament, there were all kinds of jokes. Did you unpack your bags? Where are your books? We knew we had a chance to beat Stanford, but we were the only 15 people that thought we could because no one else did. We really thought we could beat them.”
The Cardinal hosted the first-round matchup at the characteristically rowdy Maples Pavilion, where, at that point, Stanford had not lost in 59 games. Two stars—Vanessa Nygaard and Kristin Folkl—were missing from the Cardinal lineup due to ACL tears, while the Crimson boasted the nation’s leading scorer and an All-American in co-captain Feaster. But Stanford was still the heavy favorite, with All-American Olympia Scott and a great supporting cast leading the way in front of a boisterous crowd cheering on the title favorites.
“Stanford was one of the best home crowds for women in the country,” Delaney-Smith recalls. “They always sold out, [and] they had very, very crazy, wild [and] loud fans, so the place was packed. We were up at halftime, and we knew it was going to be that loud, so I had signs for some of my calls [in the second period]. Everyone made fun of me because I didn’t use signs ever, [but] I had to use them for that game because we didn’t use hand signals. That was the only way I could do it.”
Delaney-Smith’s now infamous flashcards and Feaster’s phenomenal performance were the two things that characterized the historic 71-67 win over Stanford. Feaster stole the spotlight on the national stage, outplaying her Cardinal counterpart Scott by recording 35 points and 13 rebounds. The game’s biggest defensive play came at the expense of Scott, when Feaster caught up to the Cardinal scorer on a breakaway and jumped high enough to prevent her layup from going in. The play sparked a 9-2 run that sealed the upset.
“The Harvard-Stanford game was obviously a defining moment in the history of Harvard basketball, but I don’t recall specific details about the game,” Feaster admits. “A monumental win such as that one does not occur in one moment. Our win was a testament to our team’s unity, our belief in the system, and our belief in our coach.”
It marked the first and only time a No. 16 seed has triumphed in either the men’s or the women’s tournaments.
Delaney-Smith fondly remembers the craziness of it all.
“We stormed the court. … I was babbling. It was very surreal. ... Anne Meyers was the person doing the interview on TV, and I know Anne, so I had said while everything was shut off, ‘Anne, do not let me make a fool out of myself, please.’ And then with cameras rolling, I said something like, ‘It was better than my wedding night’ or something—it was really awful.”
SUSTAINING EXCELLENCE
It didn’t take long for Delaney-Smith to recover from Feaster’s graduation. In 2000, Hana Peljto arrived in Cambridge, and she enjoyed similar success to Feaster. Peljto was a dominant scorer, winning two Ivy League Player of the Year awards and averaging 23.7 points and 9.7 rebounds per game in her senior year. With Peljto in the program, Delaney-Smith won two more Ivy titles.
“I will always remember the day I first met Kathy as a high school senior,” Peljto says. “She impressed me with her genuine [character].  She told me right away that I would have to work hard to earn my spot on the team if I was to go to Harvard, which was in stark contrast to what the other coaches were promising me. She set the expectations for me then that would lead to my hard work and strong development as a player over the next four years.”
It was also around the start of the Peljto era that Delaney-Smith was diagnosed with breast cancer, a condition that came as a shock to the usually healthy and animated coach. But Delaney-Smith did not hide her illness. She let her players know about it from the start, and she managed her therapy and doctor visits around the 1999-2000 season. It took almost a year for her to combat the proliferative disease, but in the end, Delaney-Smith won her battle with cancer.
“I don’t think the team noticed a big difference in me,” Delaney-Smith says. “There’s a couple of comical moments when there is memory loss or I did funny things with my wig and being bald. I think there were more funny than bad memories.”
After Peljto’s departure in 2004, center Reka Czerny ’05 won her coach another title in her senior year, garnering the conference’s Player of the Year accolade in the process.
Delaney-Smith’s excellence in coaching transferred over to the international stage that same year, when she was appointed head coach of the USA Basketball team that competed at the World University games. She and her team won gold that year, and two years later, she helped capture the same medal at the Pan American games in Rio de Janeiro.
Delaney-Smith’s last two Ivy titles in 2007 and 2008 came with Emily Tay ’09, Katie Rollins ’09, and Lindsay Hallion ’08—currently a Harvard assistant coach—leading the way. Each member of the trio averaged double figures in scoring in both of the winning campaigns, a feat that reflected the balance of Delaney-Smith’s offensive system.
“She has this unbelievable eye for talent,” Rollins comments. “She’s so motivational and inspirational. She has this unique ability of taking all these individual all-stars and creating a unified team, bringing this team together and getting them to work together, and work on the same page because, ultimately, what it takes [to win] is teamwork.”
BEYOND THE COURT
Apart from the coaching acumen she developed over many years at the helm of the program, Delaney-Smith prides herself above all in trying to mold the perfect student-athlete. Although she enters each season with her eye on the league trophy, Delaney-Smith does not name the Ivy title as her most important objective.
“I have stayed 30 years because I love the student-athletes that I coach—that is at the top of the list,” the coach acknowledges. “I love watching them come in here and grow not only as player[s] but also as people. I think that’s probably the most satisfying thing.”
To develop her athletes’ games and help them mature in and out of the classroom, Delaney-Smith takes the time to talk to her players, giving them advice and serving as a mother figure in these players’ lives.
“When I can’t reach a player, when there wasn’t enough growth in that person—that’s my biggest failure,” Delaney-Smith says. “That when they left, they just didn’t seem to get it. When I say get it, I don’t just mean basketball—I mean the larger picture.”
“My favorite moments were holiday dinners at Kathy’s house,” Tay remembers. “By welcoming us, she showed us she was more than just a coach.”
Delaney-Smith worries about not only her players but also the women’s basketball scene. She understands that the women’s game has come a long way, but there is still room for improvement. In past years, Delaney-Smith has filed lawsuits to ensure that her teams are guaranteed equality in all aspects.
“I do believe that over my 41 years of being in athletics, women have had to hold their own regarding equality—financial, marketing, uniforms, practice time, coaching staffs, public interest, attendance at games—it’s an ongoing thing because of the world we live in. That’s probably one of my all-time passions,” Delaney-Smith states.
It’s hard to imagine Delaney-Smith not eventually getting her way. Whether it’s on the court, in chemotherapy, or in the courtroom, Delaney-Smith has always found a way to come out on top.
“When I think of Kathy, I think of resilience,” Peljto said. “She has dealt with adversity throughout her life, but through it all, she has stayed positive and looking forward. She truly is someone that I have looked up to, both as a player and today when my playing days are over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not often that a freshman can walk onto the college basketball scene and make a splash, but sophomore guard Christine Clark did just that last year as a rookie on the Harvard women’s basketball team. Playing in all of the Crimson’s games last season, she contributed greatly in both scoring and on the boards.
“Last season, coming in as a freshman, I was fortunate enough to start,” Clark says. “Throughout the season, I was just learning about college basketball, the level of play, and the different things you have to focus on. During the season, it was just a big learning experience for me.”
Averaging 12.1 points and 4.7 rebounds per game, the freshman ranked fourth and second, respectively, in those categories for Harvard. She even had the distinction of sinking a game-winning shot against Columbia in the squad’s second Ivy League game of the season.
With the start of the new season, Clark will take on a larger role and attempt to lead the team to an elusive Ivy League title.
“I think she’s showing signs of leadership on the court,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith says of Clark’s recent play. “When she’s in the point guard spot, she’s got a better feeling for the system and leading as a point guard, whereas last year, that was very difficult for her.”
Clark’s leadership on the court will be crucial as Harvard seeks to integrate five freshmen into the team. Still, it is not only her leadership on the court that is important, but also her role off the court that has helped the rookies settle into the demanding Harvard lifestyle.
Freshmen have a lot to learn about academics and collegiate sports. Clark has been there to help them adjust.
“This year, I think I definitely stepped more into a leadership role,” Clark acknowledges. “Just in general, being a better teammate and helping the freshmen with classes and things outside the basketball realm.”
By taking a more proactive role in helping her younger teammates, Clark is following in the footsteps of previous upperclassmen who helped welcome her onto the team last year.
“I thought that the team that I came into was very supportive,” Clark notes. “The whole team atmosphere was very helpful in helping freshmen adjust to the program.”
During the offseason, Clark put in many hours to improve her game with the hope of leading the Crimson to an Ivy League title. At home, her stepfather is a high school basketball coach, so she had a chance to practice with the girls from her hometown every day while mentoring high school players.
“I think that my shooting has really improved as far as quickness of the shot, form in general, and consistency in making the shot,” Clark says. “And, my overall mental side of the game [has improved] as far as understanding different setups and paces of the game from the point guard position.”
Delaney-Smith has noted the positive changes in Clark’s game and believes that she has the potential to have an even larger impact on the team this year.
“She’s stronger; she’s more fit,” Delaney-Smith remarks. “She’s added control, a pull-up jumper, and she’s more accurate as a three-point shooter. So, I think her whole game has improved, to be honest.”
Delaney-Smith believes that Clark is actually one of the top five players in the Ivy League. In fact, the coach feels that Clark has real star potential.
“The intensity and work ethic with which she plays the game is never wavering,” Delaney-Smith says. “When you play with a player like that, it’s really inspirational.”
The biggest challenge for Harvard this year will be maintaining focus through the grind of the season. So far, the team has really emphasized defense and rebounding as potential areas of improvement.
“I think we’re a great offensive team and that we have a lot of skill in that regard,” Clark says. “I think we can be a great defensive and rebounding team, and that’s what we’ve been working on in practice.”
This weekend’s Hawkeye Challenge will test the Crimson as it faces off against non-league opponents. Other than winning the overall tournament, Clark says that two main goals will be to out-rebound every team and maintain a strong defensive presence throughout each game.
With Clark as one of its leaders, the Harvard women’s basketball team will look to bring home an Ivy League title.
“Every year, the biggest goal is to win the Ivies,” Clark states. “That’s what we are expected to do. Now, I just hope to take all the things that I learned last year as a freshman and now apply them to this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yes, he is from Canada, but no, sophomore Laurent Rivard is not a hockey player.
“People ask me that all the time,” Rivard says. “I used to play [hockey] in the park and with my dad, and the game is fun, but ... I’m all about basketball.”
Ever since he put up 12 points against Mercer in his Harvard debut last season, the 6’5 Quebec native has kept Harvard fans captivated with the sight of a Canadian dominating on the court—and not the ice.
Last season, Rivard averaged 11 points per game and led the Crimson in three-pointers with 61, third best in the Ivy League. With his long shooting range, Rivard is again poised to be a major offensive threat for Harvard this year.
“He’s a terrific long-distance shooter, and I told him there’s probably only one better shooter in this town—and that’s Ray Allen,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker says.
Growing up in Saint-Bruno, Quebec, Rivard was likely expected to take up hockey. But with a former basketball player for a father and a mother with significant connections to Canada’s national basketball league, Rivard broke the norm.
At the age of seven, Rivard picked up an early passion for both basketball and mountain biking. Growing up, he spent nearly every Saturday dividing his time between the court and the race track.
As he grew older, Rivard, a natural athlete, excelled in both sports. After winning the Canadian national championship for mountain biking, Rivard was invited to suit up for the U-17 Canadian National Team.
At that young age of 15, Rivard had to make a difficult decision between his two passions: mountain biking and basketball. While his decision is now clear, it was a pivotal one.
“I really miss [biking],” Rivard says. “When I go home, I still train on my road bike for stamina. But it’s always something I can go back to again, even after basketball. My dad still does it, and he loves it.”
A major factor in Rivard’s decision to stick with hoops was the greater opportunities available to young athletes in the sport. And shortly after he made the full-time commitment to basketball, those chances quickly presented themselves.
In his junior year of high school, after being spotted at an American basketball tournament, Rivard was asked to play for Massachusetts’s Northfield Mount Hermon Preparatory School, where he would eventually be heavily recruited by Harvard and other American universities.
But the transition to the United States, at least at first, was less than seamless. A native French speaker, Rivard struggled with his sudden immersion into an entirely English-speaking environment.
“My junior year of prep school, it was pretty tough,” Rivard says. “[On my first day], my first class was a U.S. History class, and we had to read George Washington’s Farewell Address. I called home, and I was like ‘Ma, I’m not going to be able to do it.’ But I eventually eased into it and people helped me a lot.”
Although the language barrier proved to be an unavoidable obstacle in Rivard’s academics, it was an even bigger challenge throughout the recruiting process.
“It was tricky. Coaches would ask me a question, and I couldn’t really say what I really wanted to say,” Rivard recalls. “It was hard to say what I wanted.”
Now a sophomore in Cabot House, Rivard, who still struggles with the occasional word choice or French-to-English translation, distinguishes himself as not just a basketball star with a knack for French, but also one with a knack for computer science.
The son of a software translator, Rivard began studying computer science in high school, but his enthusiasm for the field only blossomed once he reached the university level of study.
Despite the notorious amount of work assigned within the concentration and Rivard’s loaded practice and lift schedule, he remains committed to computer science and will officially declare it as his concentration later this month.
“CS is something I enjoy doing,” Rivard says. “For me, it’s not a pain in the ass. It’s definitely time consuming, especially considering that time is what I don’t have. But I just have to be focused.”
Amaker believes that if Rivard applies the same work ethic to his programming as he does basketball, he will excel in both.
“Laurent has an incredible capacity for work,” Amaker says. “He’s going to work, or out-work, probably everyone he faces this season.”
While Rivard hopes to program iPhone apps later this school year and into next summer, he still has a potential Ivy League title and NCAA tournament bid to focus on for the time being.
Even for an athlete with such a varied background, that should keep him well-occupied.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looked like Harvard women’s basketball coach Kathy Delaney-Smith had hit it the jackpot in November 2010 when she signed Temi Fagbenle, the Crimson’s first top-20 recruit in recent memory.
Only a year later, Delaney-Smith found out that her new recruit would be ineligible to play her freshman season in a Harvard jersey. According to the NCAA, Fagbenle, who came to the United States after her sophomore year of high school, stayed at Blair Academy in New Jersey for an extra year for athletic rather than academic purposes, making her eligible for only three years of college basketball.
But Fagbenle, Blair Academy, and Delaney-Smith tell a different story, calling her choice an academic decision. They also question the NCAA’s decision to use the  GSCE exam, comparable to the PSAT, to determine her graduation date, meaning that Fagbenle can only suit up for the Crimson once she’s a sophomore.
“The NCAA is trying to get a handle on players coming from Europe,” Delaney-Smith says. “As you can imagine, a lot of those players do abuse the system and stay back to gain an athletic advantage.”
“[Temi] realized that the academics were different in both countries and so Blair Academy suggested she repeat her junior year because of academics,” Delaney-Smith continues. “At that time the NCAA instituted a rule to try to control everything and arbitrarily chose the GSCE as her graduation date. … That’s the wrong test to choose, and we put in a waiver and we were denied the waiver. It’s very wrong.”
Fagbenle feels particular anger at the decision because of her family’s long-standing prioritizing of academics over athletics, one of her main reasons for choosing Harvard.
“I thought it would be perfect for me both academically and athletically,” Fagbenle says. “Academics is always the focus for me and my family, so what better place than Harvard, right?”
For the Crimson, Fagbenle’s potential benching leaves a gap in the starting rotation.
“Temi is an impact player flat out,” Delaney-Smith says. “Temi can step on the floor and impact the game immediately. She’s probably in the top five of any college player I’ve ever coached right now. We have a whole system we’re using because she’s at the core of it.”
While Harvard tries to change the NCAA’s mind, Fagbenle continues to practice with the team. If the NCAA does not overturn its decision, Fagbenle would sit in residence for a year, training with the team and starting her sophomore season as a true sophomore.
“I wasn’t happy obviously,” Fagbenle says. “But it is what it is. Everything happens for a reason, so hopefully we can get this thing sorted out as soon as possible because I hate sitting on the bench.”
While Fagbenle lays in wait, the rest of her class is working to pick up the slack as Harvard deals with an unusual amount of injuries this preseason.
Leading the charge for the freshmen class will be guard Ali Curtis from Indiana, who grew up as a coach’s daughter and averaged 16 points per game in her senior season.
“She’s very Broganesque,” Delaney-Smith said. “She has a very good shot, she’s tough as nails, she’s very unselfish, she’s a coach’s daughter, and she shows all the same signs that [co-captain] Brogan [Berry] showed as a freshman.”
Also likely to see playing time this season is New Jersey resident Erin McDonell, whose 1529 career points led her high school to its first-ever state championship at the beginning of 2011.
“She’s very athletic, has a strong perimeter game, and is developing rapidly as a low post player,” Delaney-Smith says. “You can’t teach versatility. She’s got length, she’s got athleticism, and again she came in to Harvard with a great skill set.”
Rounding out the freshman class are Kaitlyn Dinkins from Atlanta, Georgia, and Christine Mansour from Naples, Florida. Delaney-Smith sees them helping the team rebound from the loss of last year’s senior class, which included stalwarts like Emma Markley, Christine Matera, Jackie Alemany, and Claire Wheeler.
“Christine [Mansour] has a great shooting touch, a tremendous jump shot you don’t see in a lot of women,” Delaney-Smith says. “Kaitlyn Dinkens has Christine Matera shooting ability. She’s a flat out shooter, period.”
In addition to the athletic ability this class brings to a Harvard squad missing the star power of Matera and Markley, Fagbenle says that the freshmen bring an endless persistence as well.
“[Our entire team] is relentless and that’s exactly what the five of us are,” she says. “We’re so different but I think that’s what makes us so close.”
As Harvard prepares for its upcoming games, including a matchup against a tough Princeton squad, the freshman class has found time to bond over its desire to eventually win an Ivy Championship.
“[Our goal is] not really to take last year’s seniors’ place but to add a new spark to the team,” Fagbenle says. “We’re five girls, so it’s definitely a lot of new players on the squad. Our goal is to contribute as much as we can and help get this team an Ivy championship and go to the NCAA Tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In what is rapidly turning into an annual tradition, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker has once again brought a fresh crop of highly touted rookies to Cambridge. But given that the Crimson lost no players to graduation, the league-best influx of talent could make for heavy competition for minutes among the members of the class of 2015. Regardless, Amaker will certainly appreciate his team’s added frontcourt depth along with a new arsenal at the wing positions. Highlighted below are five freshmen likely to make an immediate splash.
MILLER, CORBIN
Holding scholarship offers from Utah, Brigham Young University, and Utah State, Miller instead chose to pack his bags and make a cross-country trek eastward after averaging 19 points per game in his final high school season. The guard, placed among the top five members of his class in the state of Utah by the Intermountain Hoops Scouting Service, has been quickly making a name for himself as a dead-eye shooter able to spread the floor for Harvard. “He’s a very high IQ player,” teammate Brandyn Curry says. “You can’t leave him open. I’d put him up there with [sophomore Laurent Rivard, who led the squad in three-pointers made as a rookie]. I’d like to see him and Laurent have a shoot-off. ... I wouldn’t be surprised if Corbin pulls off the upset.” Miller plans on embarking on a two-year mission trip for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after his freshman season.
MOUNDOU-MISSI, STEVE
The Cameroonian native may not have arrived in Cambridge with as many accolades as his decorated classmates—Moundou-Missi’s ESPN.com score of 84 makes him the lowest rated of the five rookies listed here, and he is not even rated by Rivals.com—but the physical, athletic forward might in fact emerge as one of the most valuable members of his class by season’s end. “He’ll find ways to make an impact every game,” says CBSSports.com analyst Jeff Borzello, who ranked Moundou-Missi in the top 150 players from the high school class of 2011 nationwide. His strong showing in the Crimson Madness scrimmage last month, which included an emphatic put-back dunk, merely hinted at Moundou-Missi’s potential to shore up Harvard’s interior game. “He can just do it all ... He can dribble, he can shoot, he has nice post moves,” Curry says. “I call him the silent assassin. He’s a quiet kid, well-mannered, but on the basketball court, he’s another animal.”
SMITH, KENYATTA
A consensus national top-20 big man, Smith chose Harvard over offers from Northwestern and Vanderbilt in September of last year. The center, named a John R. Wooden High School Player of the Year after helping lead his Rebels to their first section championship, is the headliner of his class; Paul Biancardi of ESPN dubbed him the best incoming freshman in the Ancient Eight this season. “If Kenyatta Smith were a football player, he’d be a fullback,” Telep says of Smith, whose addition to the Crimson frontcourt should prove to be invaluable for Amaker’s rotation. “He’s going to be in the lane, at the rim, finishing chances. Carve a circle five feet around the basket, and he’s going to do his best to own it. ... Once he gets his feet under him and gets his conditioning down, he should be an excellent post player for Harvard for four years.”
SAUNDERS, WESLEY
In March earlier this year, Saunders led his Windward Wildcats to victory in the state’s Division IV championship game—a six-point win highlighted by his team-best 15 points, two of which came on a thunderous slam early in the fourth quarter. After claiming two consecutive state titles, Saunders is now poised to impose his presence on the collegiate level. “[He’s a] big, strong wing that, athletically, is difficult for some of the Ivy League schools to match up [with],” says ESPN.com director of recruiting Dave Telep says. “He’s got some inherent advantages just physically, even as a freshman.” The versatile Saunders, who turned down offers from USC, San Diego State, and Colorado to come to Harvard, was deemed a four-star prospect and the 88th-best overall prospect in the country by Rivals.com. “Wes’s game is very unique,” says Curry of Saunders, whose ability to attack the rim off the dribble and elevate is his main strength. “He doesn’t look like he’s going fast or going hard, but he’ll just, all of a sudden, explode for a dunk.”
TRAVIS, JONAH
The first of his class to pledge to Amaker and his staff, Travis finished his high school career with an 87 rating from ESPN.com and three stars from Rivals.com; Twin Cities Boys Hoops ranked him fourth in his year in the state of Minnesota. The hard-nosed combination forward—who said no to a long list of schools that included Cornell, Northwestern, and Boise State—should provide a key spark off the bench and could surprise many with his unique combination of athleticism and a relentless motor. “Jonah is an absolute monster,” Curry says. “I’ve never seen a player play like he does—just the way he’s constantly in attack mode. He’s one of the best rebounders I’ve ever seen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the first day of basketball tryouts at North Carolina’s Hopewell High School. Head coach Eric Davis was observing the varsity tryout in the school’s main gym when one of his assistants interrupted him.
“My assistant coach said, ‘Coach, you need to get back in the back gym. There’s a short little chubby left-handed kid that can really play. You need to come take a look at him,’” Davis recalls.
Davis walked to the back gym to take a look. He had never laid eyes on the boy before, but he liked what he saw.
Brandyn Curry wasn’t happy to be in the back gym of some North Carolina high school on that day in 2005.
Just a few months prior, Curry thought he had it all made. He was living with his family in Matawan, N.J., and was known throughout his hometown as the local star. He was a standout in football, basketball, and baseball, and was expected to start at both quarterback and point guard at his local high school as a freshman
But things changed quickly. Curry’s parents divorced, and just weeks before the start of his freshman year, he and his siblings moved with their mother down south to Huntersville, N.C.
“I’m this chubby dude who nobody knows—quiet, had no friends,” Curry remembers of his first weeks at Hopewell High. “I was miserable and wanted to go home.”
While Davis was impressed with the new kid’s play on the first day of tryouts, Curry still needed to prove he belonged in the new environment. So when the season tipped off, Curry found himself in an unfamiliar position: riding the bench on the junior varsity (JV) squad.
But it didn’t take long for Curry to convince the varsity coach that he belonged in the main gym. After paying his dues as a freshman, Curry made the varsity team the following year and kicked off his sophomore campaign with a bang, leading Hopewell in scoring through four games.
“It really motivated him that he wasn’t getting to play as a freshman,” Davis says. “He came back a totally different player. He grew probably three to four inches. He turned into a young man as a sophomore.”
But just when Curry was starting to come into his own, the guard suffered a pulled hamstring that hampered him for the rest of the season.
One year later, Curry blew up. The guard averaged 17 points and four assists per game, and college scouts noticed. By the end of his junior summer, Curry had received 25 to 30 Division I scholarship offers, and—to the chagrin of his mother—was so busy talking to coaches that he racked up a $300 phone bill.
“My mom had to tell all [the coaches], ‘Do not call Brandyn before seven [when minutes aren’t free],” he recalls. “It was crazy.”
Four years later, Curry is hoping he can have another transformative junior season. Fully healthy for the first time since he arrived at Harvard back in 2009, the point guard has lofty goals for the coming season.
“I just want to be one of the best point guards in the nation—point blank.” Curry says. “I want to lead the nation in assists.”
Curry’s first two seasons with the Crimson were far from disappointments.  As a rookie, he averaged 7.3 points and 3.2 dimes per game, and then followed that up as a sophomore by leading the Ivy League in assists.
But Curry was limited by a torn patellar tendon in his left knee as a freshman and by tendonitis in his right knee as a sophomore.
According to Curry, both injuries are finally behind him.
“Physically, I feel better than I ever have,” he says.
Thus far in practice, Curry’s teammates have noticed the difference.
“He’s been looking really good,” says Curry’s starting backcourt-mate, co-captain Oliver McNally. “He’s fit; he’s in shape.”
And with Harvard returning one of the most potent offenses in Crimson history, Curry is being burdened with the task of making sure everything runs smoothly.
“Brandyn may be—maybe not our most valuable player in terms of numbers and those things—but he may be our most important,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker says.
Curry’s blockmate, junior forward Kyle Casey, puts it bluntly: “We’ll go as far as he takes us.”
With Curry’s teammates now relying on him to deliver the Crimson’s first NCAA tournament berth since 1946, the point guard’s days as an unknown freshman playing in the back gym seem like a long time ago.
“I’ve come a long way from being that kid who got no playing time on the JV to where I am today,” Curry says. “[Back then] I definitely didn’t see basketball in my future—I thought maybe I made a mistake in choosing it. So now for me to be here is crazy to think about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is rare that when asked about what a player needs to improve upon, a coach is rendered at a loss for words.
But Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith struggles to pinpoint something that co-captain point guard Brogan Berry needs to work on.
“I think Brogan has a complete game,” Delaney-Smith says.
The coach gushes about Berry’s unique and diverse skill set, complimenting her two-dribble pull-up jumper and ability to come off of screens as particular weapons of the three-time All-Ivy Leaguer.
Brogan Berry’s game is as unique as her name. She is undersized but has an unrivaled ability to get to the basket and is a powerful finisher.
Yet unlike most scorers, Berry has a knack for finding open teammates. While she led the team with 13.9 points per game, she also paced the Crimson with an average of 4.6 assists per contest.
“She’s the ultimate point guard,” Delaney-Smith says. “She has a very high court IQ, [and] she makes great decisions. She takes it to the hole. She can pull up. She can shoot the three. She’s a great passer. She finds balance in all of that.”
Berry came to Harvard with enough talent to earn her Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors, but she hasn’t rested on her laurels.
“I think I’ve definitely taken every year to learn from my teammates and coaches, and I try to get better every year, whether it’s going over film or going over plays with my younger teammates,” Brogan says. “I try to learn from everyone’s strengths.”
Berry spends countless individual hours perfecting her game and works religiously on the most critical fundamentals of basketball: shooting, dribbling, and passing.
She is also a student of the game. Berry has attended a camp called “Point Guard College,” which features on the court work coupled with class sessions, over the past few summers.
“Going to camps like that, reading books, and just attending a lot of games allows you to develop your game in a different way that you don’t have time to during the season,” she remarks.
Coming into this fall, Berry has focused on the leadership that she will need in order to guide a team that features five freshmen, along with a strong group of returning talent.
“This year comes down to me being an overall leader on the team,” she says. “Whether it’s being a leader by example in practice or games, or being a leader through my communication, or being able to take every individual’s weaknesses and strengths and apply it to our team goal. Everyone looks up to somebody, and that’s a big responsibility, but it’s a role I’m glad to take on.”
Berry’s role as a leader is one that Delaney-Smith feels goes hand-in-hand with her position. She stepped into the starting point guard role as a freshman, and has been looked to as a leader ever since, Delaney-Smith says.
“She’s always been a leader, but she’s going to be in charge of things like team synergy, reaching out to everyone—players that play and players that don’t play,” Delaney-Smith notes. “We’re only going to be as strong as our weakest link.”
Berry’s style of play speaks as loudly as anything she could say with words, cementing her role as a leader and teammate. She crafts her game so that her strengths augment those of her teammates.
“Brogan is a scorer so she attracts a lot of attention,” junior Victoria Lippert observes. “But with her drives, she always has her head up looking for kicks.”
Berry will need to up both her leadership and her on-the-court play to achieve the one goal that has evaded the star throughout here four years: winning the Ivy League title.
“The irony is, I think it’s amazing with how talented she is, has become, and was when she came here … that she doesn’t have a title yet,” Delaney-Smith explains. “We’re on a mission to get that title.”
Berry has no qualms with setting the bar high, after finishing last year second place in Ivy play.
“Our main goal is always to win an Ivy League championship,” she says.
But while this season begins with unfinished business, the highly decorated point guard speaks with contentment about her Crimson basketball career.
“Just being at Harvard—the best school in the country—and being able to play basketball at the same time has just been so much fun,” Berry says.  “And I’ve learned a great deal from my experiences with basketball. The lessons that I’ve learned at Harvard have been invaluable, and I don’t think I could have learned them anywhere else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When co-captain Keith Wright donned the Crimson uniform as a freshman at the start of the 2008-2009 campaign, the Harvard men’s basketball team was in rough shape, coming off of a season in which it went 8-22.
Wright became a two-time Ivy Rookie of the Week honoree, and the Crimson finished the year at .500 for the first time since 2002, notching six wins in conference play.
A few miles away, in Chestnut Hill, Mass., then-high school senior Kyle Casey dominated the Massachusetts Bay Independent League, averaging five blocks and just under 20 points per game for the Brimmer and May School.
Three years and one Ivy League championship later—the first in program history—Casey and Wright have settled into their roles as the heart of the Crimson’s frontcourt.
“They’re our best voices on the defensive side, because they can see the whole court,” co-captain Oliver McNally says. “Kyle just skies up there; Keith protects the rim ... Offensively, we look inside every time down the court.”
Both big men earned All-Ivy nods at the end of last season, with Wright taking home Player of the Year honors, and accolades have continued to roll in for the frontcourt duo leading up to this season. On a recent CBS Sports ranking of college basketball’s Top 100 players in the country, Wright and Casey came in at No. 55 and 59, respectively. They were the only Ancient Eight players to make the list.
“I think they could play anywhere in [the] country, and putting them in the top 100 or even the top 50, that’s kind of what it means,” says CBS Sports analyst Jeff Goodman. “You could put them on any high major team and they’re going to play. Will they be stars at a Kentucky or a North Carolina? Maybe not. But they can play at those programs and definitely will be stars in the Ivy League.”
According to Jim Markey—Wright’s high school coach at the Norfolk Collegiate School, who flew to Cambridge last week to see his former player take the court—a strong work ethic has characterized the big man’s game since his pre-Harvard days.
“He’s gotten better each year,” Markey says. “He has taken the physical aspects of his game to a much higher level. … He put a lot of work into the offseason, into the weight room, and the biggest difference is that he’s really grown into his body.
“[Wright] was always a very skilled kid from a basketball point of view,” the coach continues. “Now he’s combining all of those skills and [has the] physical aspect too.”
Casey, the 2010 Ivy League Rookie of the Year and a key contributor to last season’s success, seems to share this natural focus on improvement.
“Kyle was a guy who developed an unbelievable amount in four years,” says Brimmer and May coach Greg Kristof. “He came into [high school] as a gangly underclassman and left senior year as one of the highest academic recruited players in the country. ... He’s a guy who had an unbelievable impact on our program.
“As a senior, it was his consistency that set him apart,” Kristof recalls. “With Kyle, there are a lot of great highlights, but it’s his day-in, day-out work ethic that separates him from the rest.”
This season, Casey and Wright will have help in the post from a strong freshman class on a Harvard team that boasts unprecedented depth down low.
“We’re hopeful we can be even more productive and efficient with less minutes,” says Harvard coach Tommy Amaker. “[Having more big men this year] is going to raise the level of our team. ... We’re going to use the old adage of ‘less can be more.’ Less minutes can equate to more production and efficiency with guys even like Kyle and Keith.”
After playing the second half of last season with a broken foot, Casey enters this year’s campaign fully healthy. The junior spent the summer in Cambridge training alongside Wright and others.
“We had a really good group of guys we worked out with and played pick-up,” Casey says. “This summer was great for me getting healthy and getting back in shape and getting ready for the season.”
“We were up at six in the morning working out with the football players,” Wright adds. “This was great because they have the same goal as us, which is to win an Ivy League championship. [The summer] got us all a lot tougher, stronger, and faster.”
In addition to work put in this summer, Casey cites in-practice competition between Harvard’s go-to post players as key to the duo’s success during games.
“Keith and I are great on the court,” the junior says. “I think we really click, and we really understand what we do well, and we’re really able to play off each other well. It’s been nice—we’ve been the main two frontcourt players, so we get to play a lot with each other, and in practice we get to guard each other.”
Without graduating a single senior from its inaugural Ivy championship team, Harvard is favored to defend the Ancient Eight title this year. But preseason honors don’t hang banners, and the Crimson frontcourt will need to come up big again this year if Harvard hopes to earn its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1946.
“Coach [Amaker] kind of talks about [Casey and Wright] like they are the [Kevin Garnetts] of our team,” junior guard Christian Webster says. “Just back-line defense. Talking. Bringing that toughness and grit to everyone. They’ve helped out the younger guys too.”
Only time will tell if Wright, a member of the Lou Henson Preseason All-America team and the Preseason John Wooden Award Watch List, and Casey—the CBS Sports Ivy League Preseason Player of the Year—will lead Harvard to its first-ever outright league title.
But as Cambridge gears up for the Crimson’s home opener against crosstown rival MIT, a dynamic Harvard team that includes two of the top forwards in college basketball is poised to impress.
“[Casey] made the decision to go to a school with a great blend of academics first and athletics second,” Kristof says. “To be recognized alongside some of the kids who … are not as well rounded is a testament to what a special individual Kyle is.”
“So much of today’s athletic world revolves around rankings and exposure,” Markey echoes. “Keith was not the kid who went down that path. That’s not really what’s important. What’s important [is] how you’re going to work for your goals and get better. ... At the end of the day, it’s can you play or can’t you? And Keith is a great example of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Do you want to make history?”
One question. Just six words. But when Oliver McNally heard them, his life was changed forever.
They came from the mouth of first-year Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker in 2007, and they marked Amaker’s appeal to the San Francisco guard to come play for him in the Ancient Eight—something that McNally, up to that point, had never considered.
“I wasn’t really talking to any Ivy League schools,” McNally recalls. “I didn’t want to come out to the East Coast at all. I was talking to a lot of [West Coast Conference] and Big West schools; I was pretty set on being around California and staying close to home.”
But Amaker was able to convey a message that resonated with the guard.
“[He said, ‘Harvard’s] the most famous school in the world,’” McNally explains. “‘In a third world country, people know the name ‘Harvard.’ In every field, athletically and academically, things have been done. Football’s won, soccer’s won, but basketball never had. You can make history, people will remember you and the team you played on as doing something Harvard had never done before, and you can’t really do that in a lot of other fields here.’”
It wasn’t an easy decision for the high school senior, who had become accustomed to greatness with three consecutive Division V state championships, during which his teams posted a combined 129-12 record. McNally looked at the Crimson and saw a squad which had never won anything, a bottom-feeder in a league typically dominated by Princeton and Penn. The team had struggled to an 8-22 record in Amaker’s first season, and losing was one thing McNally wouldn’t accept.
“Something that was very important to him then was knowing how we were going to put a plan together to win here at Harvard,” Amaker recalls. “He’s a very competitive kid, so we knew right away that his value was critical for our team.”
The guard eventually agreed to take a chance and cross the country as Amaker’s first Crimson commitment. Three years later, the reward for that choice finally arrived in the form of Harvard’s first-ever Ivy League title.
“I bought into everything Coach said then, and I’ve bought into everything he’s said since,” McNally says. “It [was] tough putting your face into something, especially something that wasn’t doing so well … So to be a part of that transition is just really special, and to do it with a team that was extremely close to each other last year on and off the court was awesome.”
The junior played a key role on Harvard’s first-ever title team, averaging 10.1 points and 3.1 assists per game. He also shot 92.6 percent at the free-throw line, good for second in the nation (a number he admits he finds “pretty shocking”).
But to the guard who says he’s not a stats guy, more important was his role as a leader and co-captain on a youthful team that last year contained no seniors. The fact that it was his teammates—rather than his coaches—who chose him and forward Keith Wright as their captains made him consider the role an even greater honor. But with the distinction came increased responsibility.
“[Being a captain] means you have the respect of your teammates, but it’s also a burden,” McNally explains. “You can’t take practices off; you can’t take drills off; you have to set a tone for the rest of the team. … It’s something I take really seriously and something I’m really proud of.”
Initially hesitant to come to Harvard, McNally has already left a lasting mark on his team. CBS Sports college basketball analyst Jeff Goodman calls him “one of the best leaders in the country,” and many of his teammates consider him the heart and soul of the squad.
“Oliver is definitely our spirit, our energy, our vocal leader,” junior forward Kyle Casey says. “He’s just a fighter. He’s the ultimate competitor. He hates to lose [and] loves to win. You can see it in his style of play. ... That’s really what he brings us, that strong, steady spirit, day-in and day-out.”
Casey specifically recalls one home game last year against Brown when McNally sprained his ankle in the first half, and Harvard went into halftime behind by 24 in a key Ivy contest.
“Coach is talking to us in the locker room, and Oliver crutches in, and all we can hear is Oliver flipping out,” Casey says. “He really got on us and fired us up.”
The Crimson came back to win that game, completing the fourth-largest second-half comeback in NCAA history. It is in such moments of adversity McNally knows he most strongly needs to lead.
“There’s so many examples in practice when you don’t feel the energy in certain drills, or you know Coach Amaker is looking to have a great practice,” McNally says. “That’s something that falls on [the captains’] shoulders.”
In return, his coach always takes into account what his co-captain has to say.
“There’s no more important voice on our team than Oliver,” Amaker explains.
But before McNally could reach the peak of his collegiate career, he had to fight through some valleys too. He had been the team’s starting point guard alongside Jeremy Lin ’10 for most of his sophomore year, but after struggling early in the Ivy season, McNally was replaced in the starting lineup by then-freshman Brandyn Curry.
Instead of sulking at having lost his job to a rookie, McNally took the benching in stride and used it as motivation to get better.
Once the year was over and Lin had graduated, McNally had a chance to start again. But it wouldn’t be an easy transition, as he and Curry—two pass-first point guards—didn’t seem like the most natural backcourt pairing on paper.
“We didn’t really know what was going on,” McNally recalls. “The first time we started together, Coach Amaker just said, ‘Figure out what you guys are going to do.’ I deferred to Brandyn because I felt when the two of us were on the court, he was more valuable at the ‘one’ while I was at the ‘two.’”
Once again, McNally’s maturity helped the squad solve a problem, and last year, the pair of guards successfully shared a backcourt while each contributing something unique to the championship-winning team.
“We play extremely well together,” McNally says. “I take a lot of pride in my help-side defense, [while] he’s better on the ball. ... It’s worked well for us.”
The senior thus learned a lot from the setback of losing his starting spot and did so in a manner that has allowed him to thrive. But on March 5, McNally hit a nadir that will be more difficult to recover from.
With 2.8 seconds to go and his team up by one in the Ivy one-game playoff against Princeton, the co-captain was tasked with defending Tigers guard Doug Davis along the baseline near the Princeton basket.
The inbounds pass went to Davis, and McNally leaped in an attempt to block his shot. By the time he landed, he realized he had jumped too soon, falling for a pump fake that Davis followed with a game-winning jumper at the buzzer to send Princeton to the NCAA Tournament.
“[Playing in the tournament] is one of my dreams that I’ve had since I was a little kid,” McNally said. “I want to play in it one time before my time is up, and that was taken away from me.”
But McNally has refused to allow his teammates, or himself, to dwell on the loss or feel bad for themselves. Instead, he has once again used a challenge as motivation, setting big goals for the upcoming season.
“If you asked me four or five years ago, I wouldn’t have cared how we got [to the tournament],” McNally says. “But I want to win the Ivy title, and I don’t want to share it. That’s my number one goal right now.”
From becoming Amaker’s first commit and enduring a .500 freshman year when he played just 23 minutes per game, McNally’s road to the top has been a long one. Having seen the program transform before his eyes over the past four years, 2011’s championship is something the senior doesn’t want the team’s younger players to think came easily.
“Basically everybody here except for [senior] Andrew [Van Nest] and Keith and I have had a lot of success,” McNally says. “It’s a process; you can’t take the winning for granted. And it’s different having the bull’s-eye on us right now. It only means we have to work harder as a team.”
His coach couldn’t be more thankful that McNally bought into his message four years ago, and he knows the co-captain will be a major component on a team that this year hopes to dance for the first time since 1946.
“[His role] is invaluable,” Amaker says. “Without his heart and soul, we’re not where we’ve been in the past, and we’re certainly not where we want to go in the future.”
In McNally’s personal future—his long-term one, that is—he says he hopes to continue his career overseas when he graduates.
“I’m kind of leaning towards trying to see how long I can play basketball,” McNally says. “The quote I always hear is, ‘Make them take the jersey off your back.’”
Judging by Oliver McNally’s personal history, that task may be much tougher than it sounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
5. End of Occupy Harvard
Congratulations student protesters, your demonstrations succeeded in aggravating the majority of the Harvard community. Now you can take your tents out of the yard and use them to tailgate the men’s basketball and hockey games at home this weekend.
4. Men’s Water Polo (9-18, 6-9 Ivy)
Its record isn’t that impressive, but the Crimson won its opening match at the CWPA Northern Division Championships, an 11-10 overtime victory over tournament host MIT. Despite losing its next two games, the team qualified for the CWPA Eastern Championship next weekend.
Previous Rank: Not Ranked
3. Men’s Tennis
Harvard had a strong finish to its fall season,  winning twelve matches and losing just five at the William and Mary  Invitational. Too bad the team won’t compete again until January; the athletic program could use a  few more fall winning streaks.
Previous Rank: Not Ranked
2. Women’s Soccer (12-4-1, 6-0-1 Ivy)
With a win over Columbia on Saturday, the Crimson  clinched sole possession of the Ivy League title, and more importantly, qualified  for the NCAA tournament. The team opens post-season play against BU on  Saturday. Harvard could use a change of luck against the Terriers—both the men and the women lost to BU earlier this year.
Previous Rank: 2
1. Football (7-1, 5-0 Ivy)
After beating Columbia last weekend, the Crimson is the only remaining team undefeated in Ivy League competition. With Randy Moss doing the play-by-play for Harvard’s game against Penn on Saturday, the team shouldn’t need any extra motivation to play well. That is, of course, until the team realizes that it's not the Randy Moss.
Previous Rank: 1

When the Harvard men’s hockey team hosts the Big Red of Cornell at the Bright Hockey Center tomorrow, it won’t be just another early season contest between two storied Ivy League hockey teams.
Instead, it will be the biannual matchup of the two squads with the most intense rivalry in ECAC hockey.
While the Harvard-Cornell series began long ago—during the 1909-1910 season—it only acquired its status as the Harvard-Yale of hockey in 1973.
On Jan. 6 of that year, a Crimson fan threw a dead chicken at Cornell goalie Dave Elenbaas, most likely making fun of the Big Red’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. In the next game against Harvard later that month, Cornell fans retaliated, chucking dead fish onto the ice. But there's more...
Some threw the deceased fish to make light of Boston’s seafood industry, while others did so just to throw something disgusting at the Harvard squad. Whatever the case, the tradition lives on today, as the Crimson hockey players await a shower of dead fish each time they travel to Lynah Rink, the home of the Big Red.
In particular, the Big Red faithful throw all sorts of fish, including salmon, haddock, cod, trout, and bass, as well as lobsters, squid, a shark, and live goldfish in plastic bags. McDonald’ s Filet-O-Fish, cans of tuna, and even Swedish Fish have also made their way onto the ice.
While students are hurling fish towards the Crimson players, the Cornell band plays the theme song from the movie, “Love Story,” in which the Big Red defeated Oliver Barrett’s Harvard squad.
And before the game, the Big Red community dutifully prepares. Local supermarkets will have sales on fish and a sizeable cleanup crew readies itself even before the teams take the ice. They must act quickly as the fish can freeze fast.
Since the game on Friday is at home, the Crimson will be spared the barrage of fish, but in recent years the Bright Hockey Center has been dubbed “Lynah East” due to the influx of Big Red fans, who regularly outnumber their Harvard counterparts.
So Crimson fans, come out on Friday and bring a dead chicken if you are so inclined. Because this isn’t your average Ivy League game. The rivalry lives on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has been playing MIT in men’s basketball season openers for a long time.
For example, the Crimson started its 1908 campaign with a 22-20 double-overtime win over the Engineers. But MIT got revenge on its cross-river rivals a year later with a 19-12 victory on Harvard’s campus.
By 1945, scores had increased a bit, and the Crimson got off to a strong start to its season by knocking off the Engineers, 42-21. A preview of that opener in The Crimson said the contest marked the “opening [of] what promises to be the best season for Harvard basketball since 1942-43.”
That prediction proved salient, as the 1945-46 Crimson finished 20-2 during the regular season and reached the NCAA Tournament, where it lost to Ohio State.
Sixty-six years later, Harvard has not been back to the Big Dance since.
But heading into 2011-12, it’s rather easy to make a prediction similar to the one The Crimson made just months after World War II had ended—this could be very well be the start of the greatest season in Harvard men’s basketball history.
And this time, it’s not just the school newspaper making that prediction.
Others have jumped on the Crimson bandwagon as well.
A year after winning the first Ivy League title in its history (the Ancient Eight had not yet been established in 1946), big things are expected from Harvard this year.
The squad was a near-unanimous pick to win the conference in the 2011 preseason poll, receiving 16 of 17 first-place votes (the other went to Yale). It is just the fourth time in Crimson history that the squad has received first-place preseason votes.
But it's not just the Ancient Eight where the Crimson is expected to shine; Harvard received two votes in the AP preseason poll as well. Putting the Crimson in the Top-25 may not be such a far stretch, considering Harvard finished 35th in the country in RPI last season and is expected to be even better this year.
“I think they’re going to dominate the Ivy League and have a chance to run the table,” said CBS college basketball analyst Jeff Goodman. “They’re going to be fun to watch. ... The pieces fit so well. Depending on their matchup, I could see them winning a game or two in the NCAA tournament."
Harvard is coming off the two winningest seasons in its long history. After going 21-8 in 2009-10, the Crimson improved to 23-7 last year, earning an at-large bid to the NIT only after missing out on March Madness when Princeton’s Doug Davis hit a game-winning jumper at the buzzer in the Ivy League playoff game.
But this year, Harvard wants to win the title outright, and it returns every key player from last year’s championship squad—plus the Ivy’s best freshman class—to help it do so.
The team runs through its big men, co-captain Keith Wright and junior forward Kyle Casey. Wright, the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year, has been named to the Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 Watch List and the Lou Henson All-America Team this preseason after averaging 14.8 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in 2010.
“When we get the ball outside the perimeter, we’re looking inside to Keith,” says Oliver McNally, Wright’s co-captain. “He attracts so much attention, and I don’t think he gets enough credit; he’s an incredibly unselfish player.”
Casey, the 2009-10 Ivy Rookie of the Year, battled through a foot injury for most of last season but is fully healthy and ready to improve on a sophomore campaign in which he averaged 10.7 points and 6.0 rebounds per contest.
“Kyle’s competitive, he’s incredibly athletic, [and] he gives us a dimension that at times can be unique and different in our league,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said.
Freshmen Steve Mondou-Missi and Kenyatta Smith, seven-foot sophomore Ugo Okam, and junior Jeff Georgatos provide frontcourt depth.
At the wings, junior Christian Webster and sophomore Laurent Rivard look to build on seasons where both scored in double figures (13.0 and 11.0 points per game respectively) and shot 40 percent from beyond the arc.
“Laurent’s one of our hardest workers,” Amaker said. “[And] he’s just an absolutely terrific shooter. ... He knows we believe in him, and just as important, he believes in himself and his teammates believe in him.”
Freshmen Jonah Travis and Wesley Saunders—a top-100 national recruit according to Rivals—will provide versatility off the bench.
In the backcourt, junior Brandyn Curry returns after leading the Ancient Eight with 5.9 assists per game in 2010-11, and McNally provides veteran leadership and a 93 percent free-throw percentage (second-best in the nation). Sophomore Matt Brown proved to be a valuable substitute at both positions as a rookie last season.
“Towards the end of last year, Brandyn was a monster,” McNally says. “[In workouts] he’s been looking really good, I think he worked on his shot. ... We think he’s going to lead us to some pretty big things this year.”
That squad faces the Engineers tonight at Lavietes Pavilion, where it went 14-0 last season and where the Crimson has won 17 in a row total, the 10th-longest current home winning streak in the country.
Harvard blew out MIT, 84-58, last season, in a game in which Wright, Casey, Webster, Rivard, and McNally all scored in double figures. The Crimson also dominated the Engineers, 88-61, in 2009.
But the Crimson would be unwise to overlook MIT, which is ranked 10th in the Division III Top-25 and returns its six top scorers from a year ago, including center Noel Hollingsworth, who is a preseason All-American for the defending NEWMAC champions. Junior Mitchell Kates averaged 15.6 points per game last season, while classmate Will Tashman averaged 14.1 and scored 19 against the Crimson.
The Engineers have reached the Division III NCAA Tournament in three straight seasons, while the Crimson is still looking to get to the Division I tournament for just the second time ever.
“We have a bitter taste in our mouths after how last year ended,” McNally says. “We won the Ivy title but didn’t get to the tournament. ... [So] it’s not all there, and we all just want to get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third game in a row, the Harvard men’s hockey team found  itself in a hole early on. And in its biggest contest of the season so  far, the Crimson was in its biggest hole yet, down by three goals at the  end of the first period.
But like in its first two contests, Harvard (0-2-1, 0-2-1 ECAC)  battled back, whittling the Big Red (2-2-0, 2-1-0) lead to one. That’s  as close as Harvard would get, as a late Cornell goal gave the visiting  Big Red a 4-2 victory Friday night in front of a packed Bright Hockey  Center.
“Our guys worked really hard and stayed with a tough situation early  and really battled back and made it a game,” said Harvard coach Ted  Donato ’91. “It’s disappointing to lose, but I’m proud of the way we  responded.”
“For the first five minutes and the last 40 minutes, we played our hearts out,” Donato added.
The scoring began just five minutes into the contest. Sophomore  goaltender Raphael Girard blocked a long-range shot from Cornell’s Jacob  MacDonald, but Girard couldn’t hang on to the puck, and Big Red forward  Cole Bardreau knocked the rebound past the sophomore to give Cornell  the early advantage.
Tensions ran high the whole contest, and just a minute later, junior  forward David Valek laid a vicious check on a Big Red forward. A scrum  ensued, during which junior forward Alex Killorn grabbed an opposing  player’s facemask. Charged with a game misconduct and a facemask  infraction, Killorn gave Cornell a five-minute power play and was  ejected from the contest.
The penalty proved to be a critical blunder, and the visitors  capitalized. Scoring twice in the next five minutes, the Big Red opened  up a commanding 3-0 lead by the end of the period. Overall, Cornell  dominated the frame outshooting Harvard, 18-3.
Thanks to Killorn’s penalty, Harvard also lost one of its most  dangerous forwards. The junior currently leads the Crimson in goals, and  last year his 15 goals paced the team.
“[Killorn] is a key guy in our power play, and probably up front is our leading ice time guy,” Donato said. “[Losing him] hurt.”
In the second period, Harvard rebounded sharply. Freshman Stephen  Michalek replaced Girard in goal, and the defense settled down, limiting  the Big Red to just four shots on goal.
And finally, despite the loss of its stalwart, the Harvard offense found its groove.
On a power play 6:16 into the second frame, junior defenseman Danny  Biega fired a shot from the point towards the left side of the goal.   Junior forward Marshall Everson redirected Biega’s attempt past Cornell  goaltender Andy Iles and into the back of the net, putting the Crimson  on the board.
“It kind of feels like a broken play,” Everson said of the goal.  “[Because] of all the confusion, I was a little open in front, and Danny  threw one on and I was able to get a pretty good piece of it. I think  with the screen involved, I don’t think the goalie ever saw it.”
Thirteen minutes later, Harvard took advantage of the power play once  again. With just 11 seconds left on the clock in the period, junior  forward Alex Fallstrom knocked another rebounded shot past the Big Red  netminder.
But after clawing back to within one goal of the Big Red, Harvard  would get no closer. Despite controlling possession and outshooting its  opponents, 7-4, in the final frame, the Crimson couldn’t get the puck  past Iles, who made a number of impressive stops on the night.
“[Iles] played well tonight,” Everson said. “There’s countless times when he…made some really big saves.”
One of Iles’ biggest saves came late in the third period on a shot by  freshman forward Colin Blackwell. With less than four minutes left on  the clock, Blackwell attacked from Iles’ right, lobbing the puck to  himself to avoid a Cornell defender and then skillfully hitting the puck  towards the Big Red goaltender.
But Iles blocked the shot, and the Big Red attack responded quickly.  Just a few moments later, Cornell’s Brian Ferlin found John Esposito in  front of goal, and Esposito knocked it past Michalek to give the  visitors the commanding 4-2 lead with just 3:30 left to go.
Some final Crimson attempts at goal proved fruitless, giving Cornell its sixth victory over Harvard in its past seven tries.
“Going into the third period, we were [feeling] positive,” Everson  said. “It’s tough not to get all the way back into the game and tie it  up and win it later.”

Though a phenomenon of dubious origins, the habit of making a wish when the clock reads 11:11 may be related to the belief that repeated numbers herald good luck. Some believe that a wish made this Friday morning may be more likely to come true because of the abnormal number of repeated digits in the date and time. In anticipation of the clock striking 11:11 on 11/11/11, we sent a roving reporter around campus to see what people had to say about the tradition of making wishes according to the clock.
