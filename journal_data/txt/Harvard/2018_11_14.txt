After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council’s election period for president and vice president officially opened on Monday. Like all other election seasons, this time calls for reflection on the past year and critical evaluation of what can be improved in the year to come. Which people should occupy these positions should be incumbent upon whether their election promises to affect these changes.
One of the largest issues plaguing the UC and presidential campaigns is a lack of accountability. Year after year, candidates offer programs or push for initiatives that do not come to fruition. Pledges to complete certain improvements or to communicate progress to the student body continuously fall short. There is little done to ensure that candidates are held liable for the plans they lay out in their campaigns.
The next UC president and vice president should place precedence on being transparent in their inner workings as well as communicating effectively with the student body. Accountability is crucial in sparking change; we encourage the UC to make tangible efforts to be more accountable to their fellow students and actually create goals that are reachable.
Given that, we believe that the two tickets that bring UC experience — Sruthi Palaniapppan ’20 with running mate Julia M. Huesa ’20 and Nadine M. Khoury ’20 running alongside Arnav Agrawal ’20 — are very similar, and we see positive aspects in each. While both of their particular experiences within the UC will be especially valuable in improving how the UC operates internally, we believe that the Palaniappan-Huesa ticket presents the most attainable goals.
In the long run, we believe that making the greatest impact on the student body today is of primary importance. Palaniappan and Huesa aim to do so in their prioritization of the first-generation faculty mentorship program and in their emphasis on communication. Specifically, they plan to communicate with the student body by way of videos and by keeping in conversation with many cultural and identity groups on campus. We endorse the Palaniappan-Huesa ticket because we believe they make the most realistic promises and have goals that are more likely to take shape in the undergraduate community.
Regardless of how the elections results turn out, all of the candidates echo one another in their platforms, underscoring the pressing need for many changes to occur. For example, the ticket of Daniel K. Ragheb ’20 and running mate Samyra C. Miller ’21, like the Palaniappan-Huesa ticket, places crucial import on spearheading sexual assault and mental health reforms, and, similar to the Khoury-Agrawal ticket, focuses on improving social spaces. These are real and urgent issues across campus that evidently require addressing. All tickets should take a careful look at their peers’ proposals and attempt to incorporate the spirit of those ideas into their objectives as president and vice-president.
Ultimately, we hope that the winning ticket will not only work to achieve their vision for the College, but also prioritize designing accountability mechanisms, and following through on their implementation, to keep the student body informed of their progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard students headed to the polls here in Cambridge or mailed in their absentee ballots. It marked the conclusion of months of University-wide efforts, including the student-founded Harvard Votes Challenge, to increase voter turnout. As part of this, Harvard students received an email from University President Lawrence S. Bacow with the subject line “Democracy” on Nov. 6.
In the email, Bacow reminded students to exercise their civic duty and vote. He said, “Americans will head to the polls for the midterm elections and fulfill the first responsibility of citizenship in a democracy.” But is this really a democracy?
Rather than a fair and democratic system, our election process is ruefully undemocratic, and the process of voting here on campus sheds a different light on the great American ritual of casting ballots every other November.
The first question you were often asked upon walking up to one of the Harvard Votes Challenge registration tables around campus was “What state are you from?” This question, though seemingly simple, seemed to conceal a deeper question. Essentially, you were asked “How much will your vote count?”
If your home state is Wyoming, the answer is a lot. This year, the race for Wyoming Senate seat was decided for incumbent John A. Barrasso, who won 136,329 votes as of publication. If you voted in Texas, your vote counted significantly less. Texans cast a majority of their votes for another incumbent, Ted Cruz. However, Cruz was elected by a far greater number of votes. It took 4,244,204 votes, as of publication, for the senator from Texas to keep his seat — more than 30 times the number of votes it took the senator from Wyoming. Nonetheless, both senators will get equal voting rights.
The just-over-half-a-million residents of the state of Wyoming will share the same representation in the country’s highest deliberative body as the more-than 28 million residents of the state of Texas.
This discussion of the gross inequality in democratic power does not even include those U.S. citizens who aren’t afforded any electoral power at all.
The 3.3 million U.S. citizens who live in Puerto Rico will have an even smaller voice in deciding the composition of the Senate. Puerto Rico receives no voting representation in the Senate or the House. It is hard to overstate just how staggering this is. Despite having a larger population than Vermont, North Dakota, Alaska, and Wyoming combined, Puerto Rico will have no representation in Congress, while those states together have eight senators and four representatives. Essentially, a voter’s opinion in Puerto Rico is worth nothing at all.
It’s not a democratic system if everyone’s vote and everyone’s voice is not equally weighted.
It’s time to change our system in favor of a system where each vote matters. Perhaps turning toward a more European system which allots seats in legislative bodies in proportion to the votes they receive can begin to make the system more equitable and truly representative. Only then will our system begin to resemble a democracy.
As much as we might treasure our Electoral College and our two chambers of Congress, they do not constitute a proper democracy. When this country was founded and the legislature conceived, the 13 states of the original union each had a unique role to play. Today, when moving between states is as easy and accessible as a bus ticket or an Uber ride, why should certain states get outsized roles in our democratic process?
It’s unacceptable that someone living in New York, with a population of almost 20 million, can move just a few feet, into Vermont, with a population of about 600,000, and have their representation increased by a factor of around 30.
Everyone should vote. It’s our civic duty, and it’s a privilege that too many across the world and even across the U.S. are not always afforded. But the system we have is not just, not fair, and not democratic.
For those of us who voted, regardless of which state received our ballots, we should be proud that we did our part. We should be outraged, however, that some of our fellow students’ votes mattered any more than our own. This must be changed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember the first time I ever heard the word “gay” used in a classroom setting. It was early on in my first year, and I was shopping a class on the history of sexuality. Even though I was well aware of the subject matter of the course, hearing a professor even utter the word “gay” still shocked me; queerness felt like a personal topic to grapple with outside of school, not something an academic would concern themselves with. I had long since resigned myself to the fact that most parts of my identity, such as my race, gender, and sexuality, were not worthy of discussion in the classroom. In my mind, people like me did not exist in history. Or if they did, they were not worth remembering.
I’ve since had the opportunity to take many more courses that talk about sexuality, gender, race, class, and myriad other identities in a way that doesn’t center only the dominant narratives. But these courses shouldn’t be the exception to the rule; diverse, complete curricula should be standard. If the purpose of education is to prepare us to think critically about important issues and lead meaningful lives, how can we achieve that if we have an incomplete picture of where our society has been and where we can go? Thus, Harvard has an obligation to make sure that no one leaves its gates without having at least a basic grasp on issues that center people who are not wealthy straight white men — such as abolition, the AIDS epidemic, civil rights movements, the waves of feminism, labor reform, gender inequality in the workplace, and police brutality. All these and more are important parts of both history and our present times — and just as important as knowing the Founding Fathers or Abraham Lincoln. No education is complete without them.
One major part of curricula that needs to be changed is the breadth of topics covered. Too often, it feels like there’s the “normal” history (read: history about wealthy straight white men) that everyone knows, and then there’s the “niche” history (read: history about literally everyone else) that’s optional. And this issue doesn’t start in college; K-12 curricula are notoriously incompetent at including information about notable women, people of color, and BGLTQ people, choosing to gloss over more difficult topics like racial or gender inequality in favor of perpetuating dominant narratives about straight white men.
Due to these holes in primary and secondary curricula, it’s no wonder that a large portion of Harvard students seem to come in with little knowledge of any history not involving wealthy straight white men in Western cultures. I came in knowing that I wanted to have a better understanding of minority identities, so I actively sought out courses that focused on these topics. But diverse curricula shouldn’t be opt-in; every department should be conscious of these topics and weave them cohesively into all their courses. Just having a week dedicated to race or gender is a good start, but far from enough. Race, gender, sexuality, and class impact every aspect of our current lives and every aspect of history, and that should be fully reflected in curricula.
Another consideration is not just which topics are presented, but also how they are presented. Faculty and staff should avoid simplistic generalizations or revisionist history. It may take a little longer to find or conduct quality research on these frequently less-explored topics, but it’s important to be thorough to prevent misinformation and mischaracterization. For example, one class I took last year framed European colonization and its role in the Atlantic slave trade as entailing the “movement and exchange of ideas and materials across different countries and cultures,” which is an incredibly simplified if not downright inaccurate view of history. The course focused on the positive gains to scientific discovery for Europeans and completely glossed over the horrific human rights violations that Europeans committed when they invaded, pillaged, colonized, killed, and enslaved indigenous peoples in order to obtain these “ideas and materials.” The excuses from the course heads seemed to echo an overused narrative: that there weren’t enough sources about colonialism that didn’t center the benefits for white people, so this was the best they could do.
Above all, faculty and staff creating curricula must be mindful of whose voices are included. The courses I’ve taken that explicitly address race, gender, sexuality, or class tend to have minority, intersectional authors for our assigned readings. But for most of the ones that aren’t, the professor might assign readings by dozens of white men and only a handful by women, non-binary people, or people of color (and that’s being generous). When academia consists of research by straight white men studying straight white men, we lose valuable perspectives. There are academics of color, women and non-binary academics, and BGLTQ academics, and they should all be represented in curricula.
Professors, faculty, and teaching staff in all fields need to be better equipped to create comprehensive curricula that cohesively address issues of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other identifiers. Failure to do so will mean Harvard has failed its students.

Although I can’t imagine his face, I must have met my great grandfather the summer I first tasted pickled watermelon rinds. They were sour and cold, and I ate them as I sat on his front porch, my legs still too short to touch the ground. I remember seeing his farm extending for miles, or what seemed like miles, dotted with peanut plants and vines of fruit.
My great grandfather, according to everyone who knew him, had a sorcerer’s ability to breathe life into the scorched red clay of Winston County, Alabama. He was never satisfied with the practical crops like turnip greens, which grow happily for any unskilled farmer. With his wrinkled hands, he managed to summon fields full of enormous, yellow-fleshed watermelons, a special variety he bred himself. I never understood how they didn’t shrivel into gas in the sun.
I remember vividly the things my great grandfather touched — the farm and the plants, the barn cats, the giant pots of boiled peanuts — and, because he and my great-grandmother never wasted anything, those jars of white rinds lining the walls of the pantry. I remember his sturdy leather work coat and the little notebook he always kept in his chest pocket. I remember his hands, weathered and dark from the sun, and how his skin turned pale at the wrist because he wore long sleeves even in the summer. But, because it has been so long, I can’t remember his face.

***
When I tell people I’m from Alabama, the response is usually an involuntary, almost-whispered “Oh.” This “Oh” conveys both sympathy and mild distaste, as if I have revealed I have athlete’s foot. After the “Oh” comes the dreaded question: “What is it like, you know, down there?” This is an insane thing to ask in small talk, because the only good way to describe what the South is really like is via a Great American Novel. Because I am not Toni Morrison, I usually make a joke about how the stereotypes are 60 percent true and change the subject.
Here’s the secret about the South: It isn’t that different from anywhere else. Consumer culture and wage labor have made most places in America more or less interchangeable. People in the South listen to the same music, shop at the same chain stores, and are miserable for basically the same reasons as people in Massachusetts. We wear shoes, and only weird people talk about the Civil War. My hometown looks like any other hometown in America, except there are three times as many churches.
No one is more horrified by this secret — their indistinctness — than Southerners, who have staked their identity on being fundamentally distinct from the rest of the country. This is why so many men in Alabama drive lifted trucks that are inexplicably covered in mud. A friend and I once tried dip because it captured the vague and directionless self-destruction we associated with the real South. Whatever genuine Southern-ness there was has been replaced by a copy of Southern-ness, as obviously fake as bad country music. This is not to say that the South isn’t different on the surface. But whatever difference there is stretches no deeper than a Garth Brooks lyric.
***
If I want to talk up my Southern-ness, which is an easy way to seem interesting, I can mention that I grew up next to a cattle farm, which is technically true. I never mention that this cattle farm is right in the middle of town because the family that owns it has refused to sell for generations. It would be more honest to say I grew up next to a Target.
The other day I was talking to a friend who is also from the South, and he mentioned how, when he was young, he helped his dad birth a calf on their dairy farm. My immediate response was a very weird jealousy. How can I call myself Southern when I haven’t midwifed a single hoofed mammal?
***
After my great-grandfather’s funeral, a number of people from around Winston County told us about his turnip greens. If you have never heard of these, turnip greens are perhaps best explained as kale that hasn’t been gentrified. My great grandfather, who struggled to makes ends meet himself, had a policy that anyone could come onto his farm and take as many turnip greens as they wanted. As long as he was farming, everyone in Double Springs knew they would have something on the table for dinner.
I have no claim on the kind of life my great grandfather lived. I did not grow up on a farm, and I have never lived in the country. I don’t have the accent. Even my memories of my great-grandfather have a sort of falseness to them — I don’t know which are mine and which are family stories I’ve imagined so vividly that they’ve become like memories.
The other day I did a silly thing: I bought a brown work coat online because it reminded me of the one my great grandfather wore. Buying clothes is often a way to telegraph some part of ourselves to the world: shallow, but no shame there. It felt like a small betrayal to wear a mass-market copy of my great-grandfather’s jacket. Like saying that I could become the sort of person he was if I did something as meaningless as wear a certain set of clothes.
***
When I met new people this summer, I told them I was from Boston. Small talk about the weather (“Boy, how about those winters!”) is far more pleasant than small talk about what people imagine to be true of a large and diverse geographical region they have never visited (“So, are you racist?”).
In any case, it seems more honest to say I’m from Boston. There isn’t the same weight there. It is technically true that I am from Alabama; and that my family has lived in Alabama for generations; and that I grew up next to a cattle farm. But I’m really just from a slightly more religious slice of generic America, not whatever people imagine Alabama to be. Maybe I should say I’m from Omaha, Nebraska. It feels just as true.
But, when I think of my great grandfather, I want to claim the South as my own. Or, at least, I want to claim the idea of the South that I think he embodied — a simple life, a rootedness in a place, and deep care for other people. He was, in my mind, the real deal. Of course, I’m just doing what the rest of the country does to Alabama — putting enormous symbolic weight on the shoulders of someone I don’t really know.
But when I remember his boiled peanuts, and the barn cats sunning themselves in the heat, and those fields of yellow watermelon, I feel that there’s something worth saving.

I will never eat pad thai again. I will never eat pad thai again. I will never eat pad thai again.
I chant this to myself as I flee Spicies, the accursed Thai restaurant previously known as Spice Thai. It’s only my first visit but I already know that I will never cleanse myself of the horrors I witnessed there.
***
I feel ready. I’ve been fasting since, well, lunch, and my stomach is as prepared as it will ever be to endure a pad thai eating contest. If I can eat an entire plate of Spice pad thai the restaurant will award me $100 in cash and a $100 gift certificate. But, as I arrive at the restaurant, I read the flyer posted in their window: “Eat as fast as you can!!” Ice-cold fear clenches my heart: I had forgotten the speed requirement. I’m ready to eat a plate of pad thai — but not in five minutes.
As I drag myself across the threshold of Spicies, I first notice the unsettling darkness of the restaurant. It is barely 6 p.m. and the night sky is already black. Spicies has dimmed the lights to a foreboding gloom. I feel a rising wave of panic.
I am intimidated by the incoherent collage of decorations for Valentine’s Day, Christmas, and Saint Patrick’s Day plastered across the walls. The desperate cheer feels like it is trying to tell me something that I am failing to understand. The mirrors on the wall seem to be there for the sole purpose of allowing me to witness my own shame.
I tell the waitress who seats us that I am here to try the pad thai challenge. She pauses: “Are you sure? It’s... big.” She holds her arms apart as if to warn me that I’ll have to force down about a fully grown sloth’s worth of noodles. Do I detect a note of pity in her voice?
My friend — who is accompanying me for moral support — swears tofu will go down easier: it doesn’t need to be chewed. Because I am afraid, I set my intense dislike of tofu aside and order the dish with tofu. Is this a mistake?
***
The glistening pad Thai mountain arrives — it’s not quite fully grown-sloth-size, but, perhaps, adolescent-sloth-size. Still, it is more noodles than I have seen in my life. It dwarfs the jaunty lemon wedge resting on the side of the plate. I feel small.
The group of four sitting beside us rises and leaves, so the mirrors on the wall are denuded of reflected inhabitants. Now everyone in the restaurant will be able to watch my self-destruction from every angle. I glance at the group of servers at the front desk. They clearly pity me.
It begins.
The first few bites are not terrible. I like pad thai, after all. But I push past this enjoyment purposefully — who has time to savor in a competition like this? After six bites, it’s no longer pad thai, just a clump of carbs that I have to defeat. I press more and more down my throat, barely chewing, barely swallowing. My friend ties my hair back: I am reverse-vomiting noodles.
Glasses of water keep appearing on the table beside me: the waitstaff all want a close-up glimpse of the spectacle. I have three glasses surrounding me, and I gulped each one helplessly: maybe they would rinse the wet soy mush from my mouth.
I look at nothing and I observe no details: I am on a mission. The ticking of the clock seems deafening until I realize there is no clock. It feels like months since I began, years since I swallowed my first noodle. I glance up to see the group in the corner — the only other people in this dark, deserted hellscape. They look at me with open revulsion.
The lemon on the side of the plate taunts me. In a fit of rage, I bit into its flesh. The sudden burst of clean bright citrus feels almost transcendent. I hit my second wind; I realize that the lemon was my ally all along.
I’m more than halfway done. I remember exactly how much I hate tofu as it re-emerges in a surge of bile in the back of my throat. I swallow it down.
Barely a quarter of the plate left, and never before in my 18 years, one month, and 30 days upon this earth have I felt such an utter disgust for food. It seems fully possible for one bleak moment that I will not make it to see 18 years and two months.
Each noodle looks like the serpent in the Garden of Eden. Tofu is Satan and original sin combined; tofu will torment me and my children for generations to come. Even that messianic lemon wedge, which died for my sins, cannot save me now.
I don’t look to the right; I know that in the mirror I would see a creature, far from the fresh-faced young girl who walked so innocently into Spicies all those years ago. My mind is consumed by the passage of time.
And then, all of a sudden, it is over. My five minutes are up. I know I have failed; I know it is the tofu that ruined me.
***
“You have a nice restaurant. I don’t want to throw up in it,” I tell the waitstaff. They seem to avoid my eyes now that I’ve failed. They dared to believe in me and I disappointed them.
I pay my bill and hobble back towards my dorm. My friend and I bid each other a good night, one of us 70 percent water and the other 70 percent pad thai.
Later that night, after re-emerging from my dorm, I pass the site of my trauma. I catch a glimpse of the assorted shiny plastic holiday decorations and feel my body convulse. I can still taste the shame of my defeat.
Do the Spicies pad Thai challenge if you dare, but take this as a warning: there are some things you cannot unlive.

Gary A. Gregory arrived at Faneuil Hall dressed in blue jeans and a black baseball cap. Ten minutes later, he returns wearing a homemade apron, mustard-brown waistcoat, white stockings, and tiny, nose-pinching spectacles. “Now I’m Superman again!”
Stepping behind a towering English common press, Gregory grabs an inkball in each hand — leather stretched over sheep’s wool — and blots an array of metal type with a rapid up-and-down motion. He grunts as he pulls a long, wooden handle toward himself with a blazing grin, pushing the inked panels onto linen paper. “That’s why they call it a printing press,” he tells about two dozen tourists. The final product is the Declaration of Independence, on sale for $17.76.
But before running the Printing Offices of Edes & Gill, Gregory worked as a sales manager for a Fortune 500 corporation in Los Angeles.
“It was actually really fun.” He enjoyed travelling the globe, having access to the “best golf courses and all the best hotels,” and entertaining customers. “But about the time I hit about 27, 28 years old, I had the idea that I wanted to do more.” Unsure of what “more” consisted of, he began with the question, “Who am I?”
The beginnings of an answer arrived in 2000, when he was relocated from sleek Los Angeles to Boston’s historic streets. At a war reenactment at Minuteman Park in Concord, he rediscovered a childhood love of history.
“It was like I was being spoken to by the universe,” he chuckles. “It was a loud voice.” With his wife’s encouragement, he began reenacting. “Boy, does she regret that.” What was then only a hobby quickly evolved from colonial battle reenactment to a deep dive into the American Revolution’s intellectual history, going well beyond “the popular history books.”
“Then 2001 happened. It wasn’t a very good year for the planet.” As business took a hit, he seized the opportunity to, at age 42, leave the corporate world. “At this point it was just management at a Fortune 500 corporation. It wasn’t that fun.”
Again following his wife’s suggestion, he channeled his love of history into a walking tour company. Applying his corporate background, he “started doing heavy research” on the Freedom Trail tourism industry. “What I saw was not particularly good. A lot of good stories, and a lot of bad clothes.” Nobody was teaching the history to the level he desired.
“So I showed up on Boston Common in a $2000 handmade colonial suit. In the 18th century, you don’t go out of the shop in your shirtsleeves, it’s considered your underwear.” The suit was made by the master tailor Henry Cooke, who sews clothes for Mount Vernon and the Smithsonian. Lessons on Liberty, Gregory’s walking tour company, kicked off with a historically-accurate bang. “We started doing real, real history.”
Next on his business plan was establishing a brick-and-mortar store along the Freedom Trail. Through his research, he settled on a print shop.
“Every time you turn around it comes back to that machine.” He gestures toward his enormous press. “I’m like, ‘That’s it! Gotta be printing.’ It is the revolution.” And it was strategic. “There was nothing else like it in Boston, so I felt from a business standpoint that would be good.”
The colonial printing business presented a few barriers: namely, not owning a printing press or knowing how to operate one. Gregory found blueprints from the Smithsonian and planned to build his own printing press before eventually acquiring one from Colonial Williamsburg.
While honing his printing skills (so difficult it would have required a seven year apprenticeship in the 18th century), Gregory searched for a venue.
“I had a lot of people telling me I was nuts.” He recalls asking a prominent Boston architect if there was a space in Boston where he could set up his non-profit shop rent-free. According to Gregory, “This guy leaned back and looked at me and said, ‘You’re out of your mind.’”
Gregory was not discouraged. “When you start down a path of intention, it doesn’t matter when somebody says something like that.” And in 2010, he found the empty Clough House near Old North Church. He told the church, “What I’d like to do is turn this from a liability into an asset for you.” The deal complete, he opened in early 2011, paying no rent.
On a sunny day, while leaning against the side of the Clough House, the architect who “told me I was nuts” walked by. “I said,” — Gregory cocks his head — “Hey. Free.”
Boston itself seems to love the print shop. NBC filmed a clip of Gregory for last year’s Super Bowl for an advertisement promoting Boston’s local color. “I told all my friends I was going to be on television, and they didn’t air it. So you kind of look dumb.”
But months later, Patriots fans, tuning in to 2018’s first game and expecting to see Tom Brady or a Budweiser commercial, were instead met with a man dressed in 18th century attire and operating a colonial printing press.

 With his sales acumen and a recommendation letter from history professor Jill Lepore (his second customer), he successfully pitched his business to the city of Boston and upgraded to Faneuil Hall early this year.
Gregory’s enthusiasm spills into his home. Without a television, he says, “I spend all my time doing printing research, revolutionary research.” This summer, he drove 21 hours to Deer Isle, Maine to pick up a 1,800 pound press for the print shop he is setting up in his garage (he also has a 2,000 pound hydraulic paper cutter). The messages he lives by, and that he hopes his shop can spread, are clear: learn about history, and “We need to do what we love.”
He remembers helping a blind customer do both. “She had been studying book arts in college, and she’s read about these presses through her whole academic career, and had no idea what they quote-on-quote looked like.” He brought her to the press and let her feel and interact with it. It was his first time letting a customer make a print. “I’ll never forget it, that first experience.”
Now, he loves giving the most inquisitive third graders, who have proven they “know more than the average bear,” a closer look at the press. “They walk away and the parents say, ‘That made our trip to Boston.’” He has not stopped beaming for minutes.
“I never get tired of it. Ever.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“‘Oumuamua,” the first interstellar object observed in the solar system, could be a probe sent by intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, according to a paper published by Astronomy Department Chair Abraham “Avi” Loeb and Shmuel Bialy, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
‘Oumuamua — which Loeb said means “a visitor from a great distance” in Hawaiian — was first discovered in October 2017 by a telescope in Hawaii. It has since moved out of the range of satellites and rockets, making it very difficult to study its composition and leaving its galactic origins a mystery.
The interstellar object is an anomaly for several reasons, Loeb said. After analyzing sunlight reflected from its surface, he and Bialy concluded that the object is at least five to ten times longer than it is wide and potentially cigar- or pancake-shaped, much more elongated than the typical asteroid.
But ‘Oumuamua’s defining characteristic — and the primary reason why scientists believe it could be a probe from an alien civilization — is the “extra push” in its trajectory, which propels it forward more than the sun’s gravity alone could, Loeb said. One possibility is that ‘Oumuamua is a comet because they too have an extra push, caused by ice evaporating on their surface and creating a rocket-like appearance. But Loeb said the comet hypothesis doesn’t match observations of ‘Oumuamua.
“In that case, we should have seen a cloud of dust or gas around it, because when you look at comets, you see a cometary tail,” he said. “But there is no evidence for anything like that.”
Loeb instead theorized that ‘Oumuamua’s unusual trajectory was caused by “radiation pressure” from the sun pushing it like a sail. For this to be the case, the object would have to be less than a millimeter in thickness.
“Light sails — sails that are pushed by light — are being contemplated now in space exploration,” he said.
Loeb currently chairs the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, which aims to create this exact kind of technology for astronomical research. He and others are in the process of designing a lightweight sail propelled by a powerful laser that will be able to search for life in the Alpha Centauri star system. He suggested that ‘Oumuamua might be a similar effort on the part of other civilizations.
“I admit, my imagination is limited to what I know, but that’s true for everyone,” Loeb said. “I was inspired by my involvement in this project.”
Loeb said he was surprised by the overwhelming interest — both from distinguished astronomers and the general public — in his paper. He said the paper was accepted for publication only a few days after its submission, an unusually fast turnaround in the scientific community.
“I think the public is very interested in this subject, and scientists very much shy away from this,” Loeb said. “For me, personally, it’s a completely legitimate thing for us to consider because a quarter of all stars have habitable planets like the Earth that could have liquid water on its surface and the chemistry of life as we know it.”
Despite ‘Oumuamua’s puzzling characteristics, Loeb was hesitant to definitively classify it as an object of alien origin.
“I prefer not to assign probabilities to the nature of ‘Oumuamua,” he wrote in an email. “We just need to be practical and collect more data on it or other members of its population. The interpretation of existing and future data is my plan for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a month of voter registration drives and vote pledge collections on the rival Ivy League campuses, Harvard has emerged the victor of the first Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge.
The Harvard-Yale Votes Challenge, launched on Oct. 9, aimed to increase voter turnout by ensuring students committed to vote. Student organizations Harvard Votes Challenge and Yale Votes jointly planned the competition in an effort to use the longstanding school rivalry to encourage civic engagement.
“It was a tough competition, but Harvard pulled through,” said Theodore “Teddy” N. Landis ’20, who co-founded the Harvard Votes Challenge and helped coordinate the competition with Yale.
At final count, 22.7 percent of Harvard undergraduates had pledged to vote or complete a civic action, compared to 17.8 percent of Yale undergraduates.
“Our victory over Yale is a good omen for both democracy and for The Game on Saturday,” Landis said, referring to this year's iteration of the annual Harvard-Yale football game, scheduled to take place at Fenway Park Saturday.
Harold Ekeh, a co-founder of Yale Votes and the president of get-out-the-vote initiative Every Vote Counts, said he was “really excited” that both schools had acquired so many pledges to vote.
“The general goal here for both schools was really to get people excited about voting, and we saw that happen,” he said.
He also said “congrats” to Harvard for winning.
In 2016, 77.6 percent of Harvard’s undergraduates were registered to vote, and 57.8 percent of students voted in the presidential election, according to the National Study of Learning, Voting, and Engagement. Meanwhile, Yale had a higher voter registration rate at 79.3 percent, though its actual voting rate came in slightly lower than Harvard’s at 56.7 percent.
Midterm elections typically see significantly lower voter turnout, however. In 2014, the NSLVE reported an average voting rate across all surveyed colleges and universities of just 18.8 percent.
Landis said once the NSLVE completes the final tally for voter turnout at Harvard and Yale, the schools will know which institution boasted the higher actual participation rate.
At Yale, Ekeh said get-out-the-vote initiatives brought administrators, student groups, and cultural centers on campus together to have a “direct impact” on student attitudes toward voting.
“We will definitely have another challenge or pledge of some sort come time for the 2020 elections,” Ekeh added.

The undergraduate members of the Harvard Institute of Politics elected the institute's first all-female executive board in more than a decade Monday, according to IOP leaders.
Anna L. Duffy ’21 and Maya Jenkins ’21 ran uncontested on a presidential and vice-presidential ticket. Grace K. Bannister ’21 was elected communications director, and Olivia M. Ferdinand ’21 won her bid to be the organization’s treasurer.
The IOP elects a team of four undergraduates annually to head its organization and student advisory committee. All undergraduate members of the Institute of Politics are eligible to vote in the executive elections.
Ferdinand, the former chair of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership program at the IOP, said it is “incredible” for her to serve on the first female-led executive team since 2007.
“It really is an honor,” Ferdinand said. “As the former chair of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership, it was so great to see so many women running to lead the IOP.”
Duffy said one of the shared priorities of the incoming executive team is to expand access to the IOP’s programs. She also said it is a goal of the new leaders to create a more social culture in the organization.
“One of the criticisms of the IOP sometimes is that people don’t feel like they have a community there,” Duffy said. “So going forward, we want to make sure people feel looped in and have more socials, especially early on in the semester.”
Jenkins added that the IOP should become “a place where people feel supported as people, not just as fancy politicians in the making.”
Jenkins said she decided to run to be vice-president because she wanted to promote the IOP as a supportive place for people of all backgrounds and identities.
“I want to be able to expand the IOP’s reach to students, particularly students of color but also students who haven’t typically felt welcome at the IOP and haven’t as welcome as I have always felt and have been lucky to feel,” Jenkins said.
Duffy said the new executives will reach out to more on-campus groups in order to bolster more diverse representation within the Institute.
“Our politics are only stronger when they’re more informed,” Duffy said. “It’s really essential to be reaching out to different identity groups on campus.”
Ferdinand said another major priority of the new executive team was to “strengthen pathways to careers in public service” by hosting more career fairs, offering interview preparation, and making jobs in the public sector “financially accessible.”
Currently, the IOP provides summer stipends of up to $4,000 to undergraduates pursuing non- or low-paying summer internships in public service. The IOP also runs the Director’s Internships program, which arranges paid summer opportunities in the public sector.
At his inauguration last month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced a commitment to funding public service internships for every undergraduate who would like to pursue such a position.
Jenkins said that though having an all-female executive team will not drastically alter the daily operations of the organization, it can send a message to students across Harvard’s campus.
“The fact that we are all girls, if it will have one kind of bigger impact, is really in showing other female students, other students who don’t identify as male that the IOP is a place where we all deserve to have leadership positions,” Jenkins said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of Law School students and affiliates gathered to see Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor preside over the final round of the school's annual Ames Moot Court Tuesday night.
The competition, founded in 1911, tests law students’ skills in appellate brief writing and advocacy. Qualifying rounds begin in the fall of the second year of law school. Competitors must advance through semifinals and then to finals.
Sotomayor — who has judged the competition once before, in 2011 — was joined by Jennifer Walker Elrod, a judge in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and Susan Carney, a judge in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Students who couldn’t squeeze into the live court proceedings filled multiple overflow rooms at the Law School. Prior to the start of the trial, Sotomayor and the other judges visited the overflow rooms to briefly speak to the students gathered.
“You don’t get a chance to see us live, but nevertheless you show up to watch, and so I’m very grateful to you for your attention and your dedication,” Sotomayor said.
The case for the final round focused on the First and Second Amendments and gun control — specifically, the right to publish instructions for 3D-printing guns and the right of convicted criminals to purchase firearms.
Sotomayor remarked on the timeliness and relevance of these mock scenarios.
“These are cases that are going to come through the courts,” Sotomayor said. “They’re wending their way through the courts right now.”
Teams of six students represented each side, though only two oralists on each team engaged in back-and-forth argumentation with the three presiding justices. All three justices were vocal throughout the arguments, asking questions specific to the fictional case and established Supreme Court precedents.
Students who attended the competition said they were impressed by their peers’ performance.
“I think that the people who participate in this competition are very brave, and I’m incredibly impressed by their ability to stand there in front of three very esteemed members of the judiciary and all their peers and professors and get grilled, basically,” Solange Etessami, a second-year Law student, said. “I think they did a fantastic job.”
First-year Law student Daniel M. Sieradzki said he came to the event to take a break from classes and learn from more senior students.
“It was nice to see how they argue, how they cite cases, how they reason through their arguments, and how they deal with the other side, and how they just manage the issue,” Sieradzki said.
Third-year Law student Maxwell F. Gottschall ultimately won the award for "Best Oralist." The award for best overall team went to a team composed of Gottschall, Erika A. Herrera, Benjamin R. Lewis, Catherine H. McCaffrey, Eliza J. McDuffie, and Jacqueline K. Sahlberg.
Prior to announcing the decision, Sotomayor said the teams were “a hair apart” and lauded the finalists in the competition.
“Every time I come to one of these and I see the extraordinary performances of the students at these exercises, it fills me with hope about the future,” Sotomayor said. “It shows me that you are being trained to think and to respond in extraordinary, lawyerly, professional ways, and that you carry in your hands our future in a really good way.”

University President Lawrence S. Bacow recently met with a U.S. Treasury Department official as the government prepares final regulations for taxing university endowments, Bacow said in an interview last month.
Harvard’s endowment, valued at $39.2 billion, qualifies for taxation under the new tax codes Republican lawmakers passed last year. The University's endowment was previously exempt from taxes because the school is a non-profit entity.
The University’s financial report released in October estimates that the tax will cost Harvard $40 million to $50 million annually. Harvard will have to pay the endowment tax for the first time on returns from this fiscal year, which ends in June 2019.
The tax was passed nearly a year ago, but the University is still awaiting final guidance for how to file.
In an October interview, Bacow said he had recently met with an official from the Treasury Department, which is responsible for developing regulations for filing taxes.
“We don't know yet how the tax is actually going to be levied since the Treasury Department has not issued final regulations,” Bacow said. “I did meet recently with a representative of the Department of the Treasury to try and explain why certain regulations, and how they get interpreted, will be important to institutions like ours.”
The process of publishing final regulations around a law may take months or years, with plenty of feedback from those impacted, according to Harvard Law School Professor Thomas J. Brennan.
“Taxpayers will often try to provide feedback on how they think the law might best be crafted, and how it may best work,” Brennan said. “There’s a whole long process with lots of input from lots of private parties.”
He added that if regulations are not finalized by the time a tax goes into effect, taxpayers have to interpret the law “as best they can.”
Not only will Harvard have to learn how to file the tax, it may also change how the University invests. Bacow said future investment strategies will depend on how the tax is eventually implemented.
“We’ve not been tax-sensitive investors in the past. And the question is: do we need to become tax sensitive investors going forward?” he said.
Experts have said that university endowment managers may change investment strategies to reduce tax burden, including considering when to sell assets.
“It can affect both your choice of what to invest in, and also probably more importantly for Harvard, how often to sell,” Georgetown Law Professor Brian D. Galle ’94 said. “We only calculate the amount of taxable gain or loss on your investments in the year in which you sell or otherwise get rid of the property.”
“The timing can be very important, and it can keep you from switching into a better investment than the one you’ve got,” he added.
Bacow said it was still uncertain whether the University would be expected to pay taxes on unrealized returns — those from assets that have grown in value but have not been sold.
Galle said he understands the law — which levies a tax on the University’s net investment income — to only apply to realized returns, which result from assets being sold.
“You don’t include something in income unless it's been sold or otherwise disposed of,” Galle said.
The Internal Revenue Service released draft guidance on the endowment tax in August, indicating that universities will not be taxed on an asset’s gain in value that occured before 2018.
The IRS also released draft guidance on other changes from the tax overhaul that affect universities, including the executive compensation tax levied on the amount of a salary that exceeds $1 million and changes to how Unrelated Business Income Tax is calculated.
Brennan said that IRS regulations fill in ambiguities in tax laws.
“Every law, no matter how well it’s written, is going to have some non-specificity, some grey area, some lack of detail that can be filled in, and that’s the job of the regulations,” Brennan said. “The substantive content of the regulations should be determined by the professionals at Treasury in light of how they read the law.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chief of Harvard’s police force said in a report released Tuesday that he would have preferred University police officers respond to calls made April 13 about a black College student whose arrest by Cambridge officers later sparked allegations of police brutality.
The night of the arrest, the Harvard University Police Department initially did not send officers to the scene and instead contacted the Cambridge Police Department. CPD officers arrived at the scene and forcibly tackled the student to the ground and punched him several times. In the wake of the incident, some undergraduates said they wished Harvard police had handled the situation from the start.
The student — who was naked and likely under the influence of narcotics — was arrested while standing on a street median a few feet from the boundaries of campus, meaning he was technically outside HUPD’s jurisdiction and within CPD’s. In the weeks and months after the arrest, Harvard repeatedly cited this geographical distinction as the reason why CPD officers responded to the calls.
HUPD Chief of Police Francis “Bud” D. Riley said in the report, though, that his department would typically have responded to the calls and waited for CPD. He said HUPD was understaffed April 13 due to an unexpected spike in the number of medical transports. The student was arrested on the night of Yardfest, Harvard’s annual spring concert.
“If HUPD had been less busy, it ordinarily would have responded to an incident involving a student that close to campus and stayed at the scene until CPD arrived,” Riley said in the report.
Riley made these remarks in a report authored by a Harvard committee tasked with reviewing the events leading up to and following the night of the arrest. The report, emailed to students by University President Lawrence S. Bacow Tuesday, outlines a series of recommendations for HUPD, Harvard University Health Services, and administrators meant to “foster institutional improvement.”
The report calls on HUPD and HUHS to clarify their policies related to student medical emergencies. It also suggests several small changes to Yardfest in an effort to combat undergraduates’ tendency to use drugs and drink heavily at that event.
Former University President Drew G. Faust established the committee — chaired by Harvard Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed — after the April 13 incident to reflect on the arrest and undertake a “systematic examination” of an array of University policies.
The forcible arrest of the student roiled campus and attracted national attention. Most of the controversy centered on CPD’s physical treatment of the student. CPD officers ultimately arrested the student for a number of charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest.
The charges were later dropped in May, according to the student’s lawyers.
A CPD report filed after the arrest stated that an officer tackled the student after he clenched his fists and made aggressive moves towards the officers. Eyewitnesses, however, stated that this account of events is incorrect and that the officers tackled the student “without provocation.”
A video of the incident published by CPD depicts officers talking to the student for at least two minutes. The student then takes two steps towards an officer before stepping back. The video shows the student raising his arms to chest-level before an officer tackles him from behind. The officer delivered five punches to the student’s stomach area in an effort to unpin his arms and handcuff him, the police report states.
Hours later, the Harvard Black Law Students Association released a statement condemning the incident as an example of “police brutality.” Days later, students at the College organized a new campus group dubbed Black Students Organizing for Change, which held a protest that attracted more than 200 attendees. BSOC also released an open letter containing a list of demands for change.
The review committee investigated the context surrounding the arrest, focusing specifically on Yardfest. The group’s final report noted that Yardfest made a “significant” and “unexpected” demand on Harvard and Cambridge medical resources.
In 2018, Yardfest saw 17 medical transports, more than five times the number of transports that occurred the year before. All transports were for intoxication or overdoses. Both Mt. Auburn Hospital and Cambridge City Hospital became so “overloaded” that they refused to accept several intoxicated Harvard students that night, Bacow wrote in his email.
Bacow wrote in the email that he is “troubled” by student behavior at Yardfest 2018.
“More generally, the report serves as an essential reminder about how interconnected any community is—how one person’s actions can have profound implications for others—and underscores the need for all of us to be cognizant of our responsibilities both to ourselves and to the broader community,” Bacow wrote.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also flagged the high rates of drug and alcohol use at Yardfest as problematic in an email sent to College students Tuesday.
“Current data – as well as some of the evidence presented in the report about Yardfest – indicates an increased use of drugs and alcohol in our community, as well as an increase in related dangerous behaviors,” he wrote. “While we are a community in which individual responsibility matters, we also have a collective responsibility to provide support and resources for students in times of need.”
The committee recommended several updates to Yardfest in order to make the event safer for students. The group’s report proposes Harvard consider alternate times for Yardfest, specifically Sunday afternoons. The report also suggest that the College ensure water is available throughout the event, not allow for re-entry to the concert, and enforce a strict “no bag” policy.
The University committee offered several recommendations for specific Harvard bodies involved in the April 13 arrest.
The report suggested HUPD clarify its role in responding to incidents involving Harvard students. The committee wrote that the department should “communicate clearly and accurately” about their role in emergency situations both on and off campus.
In response to one of BSOC’s demands — that Harvard create special response teams not involving police — the committee proposed that HUPD and HUHS work together to explore hiring mental health professionals as first responders.
The report also included several recommendations specifically targeting issues of mental health and substance abuse on campus. The report suggests that HUHS work to promote awareness of its programs under the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services and Counseling and Mental Health Services.
HUHS, like HUPD and CPD, drew criticism from some students for its response to the April 13 arrest. A friend of the arrested student first called HUHS to report that the student required urgent medical care. HUHS then contacted HUPD, which transferred HUHS to Cambridge Emergency Communications.
In the wake of the arrest, some students argued HUHS should not have contacted the police. The report noted, however, that it is University policy that the police respond to all emergency calls made to HUHS. Another criticism levied at HUHS was that CAMHS did not offer the mental health services that some students said they needed in the aftermath of the arrest, according to the report.
“In the wake of the incident, a number of students, particularly from marginalized groups, felt stress and a need for mental health services that they do not feel exist,” the report reads. “Some students voiced concerns both about the availability of services, particularly mental health services, and about demographics and multicultural competency of the clinical staff.”
In an effort to address these issues, the committee recommended that HUHS expand its informal counseling services and seek feedback from students on barriers they face when seeking care at CAMHS. The report suggests that House and Yard staff undergo training for “multi-cultural competency in mental health support” and regularly review cases with CAMHS staff.
Though BSOC called on Harvard to run a student-staffed ambulance, the report recommends against a private ambulance.
“We were told that it is highly unlikely that an ambulance for a private institution would be approved today,” the committee wrote. “Additionally, conversations with both HUHS and HUPD suggested that even if permission could be secured, a Harvard ambulance would not be desirable or practical given liability concerns and discomfort some students may feel with being treated by their peers.”
CPD and the City of Cambridge are also conducting their own reviews of the arrest. Per department policy, CPD conducts an internal investigation whenever an officer uses force. The City of Cambridge hired Roderick L. Ireland, the first African-American appointed Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to direct its own independent investigation, the results of which will be made public.
Khurana offered an initial timeline for implementing the recommendations included in the report in his email to students. He wrote that he has already instructed the Dean of Students Office to work with HUPD and HUHS to enact the report’s suggestions.
“President Bacow has asked the College to provide concrete plans by the beginning of the next semester for implementing these recommendations,” Khurana said. “In the coming months, we will communicate the next steps we will take to address the recommendations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
AMHERST— In a thrilling back-and-forth battle that was decided by one possession for the second straight season, the Harvard men’s basketball team knocked off UMass 74-71. Despite a dominant 36-point outing from Minutemen junior guard Luwane Pipkins, the Crimson (2-1) held the rest of the UMass side to a combined 13 field goals.
Junior forward Chris Lewis had another commanding night in the paint, converting 8-of-11 from the field alongside three rejections. As a whole, Harvard distributed the ball for 21 assists with 32 boards. The theme of depth resonated once again, with five bench players tallying more than 10 minutes in the contest for 22 combined points.
“We just had to have an edge about us,” junior wing Justin Bassey said. “Come in with a certain spirit and a fight…to get a big, gutsy win for us here on the road.”
Minutemen coach Matt McCall was highly critical of his side’s defense, particularly in the transition game. The second-year coach praised the Crimson for its talent level and depth, even without juniors Seth Towns and Bryce Aiken.
“Just knowing their team, a veteran team [that has] won championships,” McCall said. “They weren’t going to beat themselves and every single mistake that we made tonight they capitalized on.”
Sophomore forward Danilo Djuricic impressed early for the Crimson, finding two easy baskets at the rim before draining a three at the 15:45 mark to bring the Harvard lead to 13-7 at the 15-minute point.
Early fouls on both ends of the floor for the Crimson significantly disrupted team momentum, with four calls within the first nine minutes of the contest. Harvard put in its second unit after the first seven minutes of play, but sluggish offense led Amaker to quickly re-insert his starters at the 11-minute mark, with the lead narrowed to 18-17.
Djuricic continued to pick up important points for the Crimson, tallying his 10th point in the form of a triple off a baseline feed from junior point guard Christian Juzang at 9:13.
UMass(2-1) kept in toe with the Harvard offense, holding the visitor’s margin within six in the first 12 minutes of the half. Aggressive play at the rim from both junior big Henry Welsh and first year Noah Kirkwood brought back a four-point cushion for the Crimson, but junior guard Luwane Pipkins answered back with nifty footwork at the rim and kept UMass within striking distance. The 2018 A-10 Most Improved Player led the Minutemen with a resounding 18 points in the first frame, followed by six from fifth-year big Rashaan Holloway.
“[Pipkins] is a dynamic offensive player,” Amaker said. “I think the key obviously with us was to be able to guard the other players. I’m not sure we want to be able to contain him or stop him… but we did a really nice job elsewhere and pretty much was the difference for us.”
A triple from junior wing Justin Bassey followed by another easy look at the basket by Welsh carried the Crimson to its largest lead of the half at 7 heading into the final two minutes. UMass coach Matt McCall was markedly infuriated at the team when he called a timeout.
“I would say probably four or five times, [the Crimson] could grab a box of popcorn, ate it, and shot a three I mean, that’s how open they were.” McCall said. “That’s lack of urgency, we’ve got to get better there.”
Before the end of the first half which saw the Crimson bring an eight-point lead, Welsh accomplished a personal first. The Redondo Beach, Calif., native drained his first career-triple in a Harvard uniform, much to the delight of a surprised Crimson bench. Amaker noted postgame that his long-range game was a key offseason priority for the big man.
“I didn’t realize it was first career one,” Amaker said. “We need him to take that when it’s there.”
The beginning of the second frame was defined by Chris Lewis and Luwane Pipkins.
A sloppy first play coming out of halftime for the Minutemen was followed by a Lewis righty hook, but Rutgers transfer Jonathan Laurent answered with a contested trey. Lewis again repeated the same hook shot over Holloway and ensuingly smothered him on the defense end.
“[Holloway]’s a great player, he knows how to screen well and always goes for the offensive rebound,” Lewis said. “It’s always a tough matchup play him but the coaches told me how to do my work early.”
Amaker quickly added, “[Be]cause he is a mountain.”
Lewis limited Holloway to just one basket in the second frame, who finished the night with nine rebounds and seven field goal attempts.
For UMass, it was Pipkins who continued his scoring acuity from the first frame as he quickly added two more buckets. The Minutemen narrowed the lead to five within the first four minutes of the latter frame, but a jumper from captain Corey Johnson — who has so far this season created more opportunities of the dribble — maintained the Crimson lead at seven at the first media timeout.
Harvard’s second unit struggled to produce offensively for Harvard, and much like the first frame, Amaker quickly reinserted Lewis back into the lineup. The Alpharetta, Ga., native immediately responded, quelling the UMass run that saw the margin dwindle to one point with another lay-up.
Pipkins again was the defining shining point for the Minutemen, tallying point 29 and triple number three at the 12:40 mark. UMass then took a brief 50-49 lead — its first of the contest — but Bassey reciprocated with a corner triple on the other end.
Although Djuricic and Lewis led the point tally for much of the game, Bassey was a lead contributor in the rebound and assist columns. The third-year wing finished the contest with seven boards and seven dishes.
“I thought Bassey was terrific just with his physicality and his size,” McCall said. “ I thought offensively in the first half we were consumed with how it was going and it allowed us to be affected defensively.”
Heading into the final six minutes, the Crimson held tight in the paint, forcing missed layups at the rim. Pipkins launched another made triple, but sophomore guard Rio Haskett successfully responded with a three of his own at the 4:55 mark to preserve a four-point margin. Outside of the Pipkins three, Harvard did not allow a single bucket for over four minutes.
A Juzang and-one brought the score to 68-63 heading into the final two minutes, but Holloway responded with an and-one play of his own, but was unable to convert.
With a minute to play, the Crimson lead remained at three. A missed Juzang three was followed by a Haskett foul, bringing Pipkins to the line with 39.1 seconds to play. Pipkins knocked down both.
Coming down to the wire, the ball was placed in Bassey’s hands. Bringing the shot clock to the final seconds, Bassey drove in to the basket and drew a blocking foul at the hands of Laurent. Coach McCall attempted to ice the free throw shooter, but Bassey calmly drained both. 72-69, Harvard.
With nine seconds to go, the ball was unsurprisingly placed in Pipkins’s hands. Instead of going for the triple, Pipkins decided to attack the basket where Harvard allowed for the uncontested two points.
Only three seconds remained, and Harvard closed the tight contest out with two Juzang free throws.
“It seems like this is par for the course for our games against UMass,” Amaker said. “…I was really pleased to see the balance we had, and also ability to share the ball.”
Former Harvard basketball coach Frank Sullivan was calling tonight’s game on NESN. Before the contest, Amaker was able to share a few words with his predecessor.
“He’s a class guy and I’ve known him for quite some time,” Amaker said. “I was happy to see him happy, and see how well he’s doing.”

Winter is coming.
This week in Harvard sports marked the end of the road for some teams and the turning of a new leaf for others. As the Crimson football squad gears up to take on their nemesis this weekend on the gridiron, the Harvard hockey team kept fans on ice this Friday with a nail-biter against the Bulldogs.
Here are your top three plays of the week.
#3: A SLIP OF THE PENN


 If Harvard defensive back Max Jones’s first-quarter interception for the Crimson this past weekend is any indication of how the team will perform against Yale at Fenway, the Bulldogs of New Haven are in for a toilsome time this weekend.
After a gust of wind pushed a pass from Harvard quarterback Tom Stewart into the hands of Pennsylvania defender Conor O’Brien early on in the Crimson’s match against the Quakers, Harvard was thirsty for revenge. For the competitors in crimson, not only did this payback come in the form of victory against Penn – their first win against the Band of Brotherly Love since 2014 – but a smooth catch from Jones evened out the battle for interceptions between the two teams.
Quakers quarterback Ryan Glover tossed the pigskin 25 yards up the field for an attempted first down, but Jones effortlessly juked around a Penn receiver to pick up the possession. The Crimson’s dominance was established a few plays later, when running back Charlie Booker III closed the drive to put Harvard on the scoreboard.

#2: TAKING THE BULLDOG BY THE HORNS


 Though the Crimson was unable to emerge from the rink victorious this past weekend, the Yale Bulldogs barked up the wrong tree in challenging Harvard forward Lewis-Zerter Gossage.
With 46 seconds left in the second period, Crimson defenseman Adam Fox was just as sly as his surname as he launched the puck over the head of a Yale defender and straight to the stick of Lewis-Gossage. The Montreal native competed the breakaway with a beautiful shot past Yale goalie Corbin Kaczperski, tying the match at two goals apiece.
Harvard went on to bring the Bulldogs to overtime, ending the game in a three-three draw.

#1: SHAHBO-ING


 It was the first round of the NCAA tournament, and one of the best field hockey teams to ever wear crimson was in it to win it. Even more ready for competition contention was Harvard goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo, crouching between the posts in her typical baby-blue armor.
Within the first few minutes of the Crimson’s match against Penn State, a Nittany Lion ball was launched at the Harvard goal. Only one line of defense remained. Without hesitation, the Crimson’s freshman goalkeeper dove to the turf, Shahbo-ing the Penn State shot and securing a Harvard steal.
Shahbo went on to make six more saves, setting in stone a Crimson victory. Though Harvard fell to the Princeton Tigers in the next round of tournament play, the Crimson squad squeaked into the top ten for the first time in program history.

Some are self-aware of how ~unintellectual~ we seem (and are) based on our pregaming activities:
“I look forward to the Harvard-Yale Game every year, because there is nothing more amusing than undergraduate students from two of the supposedly most prestigious universities in the country making complete and utter fools of themselves.”
Some find the rivalry to be good-natured and a great opportunity to make friends:
“I had such a good time at The Game last year...it just felt like a big sense of community and fun even though it was supposed to be competitive, and I really enjoyed meeting Harvard students and showing them our campus, which I love.”
Others, not as much:
“Harvard has a color for a mascot so should they really be talking? I think not...”
And as always, there are pessimists on both sides:
“Harvard’s football team sucks, but so does Yale’s, so I wonder how it’ll turn out.”
But that might not matter as much as some may be homeless for the night...
“I’m a little concerned about how it’ll go...haven’t heard any information about the tailgate or how to find a place to stay for the night.”
The overall distribution of tickets was annoying for everyone this year though:
“The limited number led students to camp outside the ticket office from 5 a.m. onward. Lots of people cut the line and it was really contentious between members of the student body...People had to skip their classes in order to go.”
Especially considering that...
“Only around 2500 tickets were given to Yale for its students — and we have 6000 undergrads, so what was the thought process on that?”
And we agree that the location isn't ideal:
“One of the fun things about The Game is being able to move around and see your different friends so I think it’s a huge inconvenience to have it at Fenway. It almost ruins the ‘go with the flow’ atmosphere of the event.”
So it makes sense that there are...
“People like myself who are just going for the fun and not to watch the game.”
But the big question that we and Yalies have in common is:
“W H Y T H E H E L L I S I T A T F E N W A Y?"

The Yalies are descending upon us, much like we descended (albeit in much better style) upon them last year. If you’ve got a friend/general acquaintance/enemy at Yale, it’s likely they’re hitting you up seeing if they can crash with you for a few days of drunken incoherence. Here are some tips and tricks for surviving hosting a Yalie this weekend.
If you don’t hate ‘em, host ‘em
The great thing about hosting someone for Harvard-Yale is the next year, you can hit them up and ask to stay with them at Yale. This is some economic principle I think (you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours?), and honestly you’ll never be in your room anyway, so it’s not a huge lift on your part. And if you hate ‘em, you might want to host ‘em anyway, just so you don’t get stranded next year.
Spare Key
If you’re an upperclassman, you’ve got an extra key in the building manager’s office in case you get locked out. Check that key out and give it to your Yalie friend this weekend so they can get in and out of your room without you. But it’s like $50 if they lose it, so maybe make them Venmo you $50 first so they don’t disappear into the void that is New Haven and leave you to pick up the check.
Dhalls
Yalies are allowed into the dhalls this weekend, which is great — you don’t have to sneak them in. If you have a non-Yalie staying with you, this will also make it really easy to sneak them in. Tell them to look like a loser and the dhall staff will let them right in!
Blankets, sleeping bags, pillows, oh my!
Tell the Yalie to bring a sleeping bag if they have one. Hopefully you live in a suite or you have a couch or something for them to sleep on, because otherwise they will be sleeping on the floor wrapped in your extra blankets. Your drunk ass is definitely not going to want to share a twin XL bed.
Barf bucket
It’s really easy to get carried away drinking at Harvard-Yale, but the last thing you want is Yalie vomit all over your dorm room. Try to both keep an eye on them and set up a trash can with a trash bag in it, or something, just in case.
If you’re dreading the inconvenience of hosting a Yalie, just remember that you’ll (probably) be very drunk and it’s also just one weekend. Come Monday, you’ll be back to living the high life — away from the Connecticuter rabble.
