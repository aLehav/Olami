A lifelong comedian, actor Bob Odenkirk is perhaps best known for his award-winning portrayal of Jimmy McGill — a seedy lawyer adopting the moniker Saul Goodman in television’s “Breaking Bad” and “Better Call Saul” series. After personally developing an ambitious new story and spending more than two years training, however, Odenkirk has recently added a bona fide action performance to his filmography.
Odenkirk, who stars in the upcoming thriller “Nobody,” worked with veterans of the action genre to bring a project inspired by his personal experience to the screen. The film follows the story of Hutch Mansell — an overlooked suburban father who takes life’s punches without pushing back. After doing little to prevent some petty thieves from breaking into his home, his family seems all the more disappointed and distant. Hutch, however, decides to seize control of his life again, revealing hidden skills on a guns-blazing campaign to protect his family from more capable foes and prove his doubters wrong.
On March 19, The Harvard Crimson joined Odenkirk as part of a virtual roundtable to discuss his foray into the realm of action entertainment, the production experience, and the significance of representing the “nobodies” of the world. Much of the conversation revolved around Odenkirk’s perspective on acting in a different genre, as well as the relationship between Hutch and Odenkirk’s previous roles.
“Until I played Jimmy McGill, I had not done much on screen that wasn’t ironic or sarcastic or any comical take on emotion, moments, drives, what makes up a person, what they want, how they behave,” Odenkirk said. “Everything was comedy or exaggerated or lampooned or twisted for comic effect. Jimmy is very funny at times and Saul’s funny at times, but there’s also big scenes that are utterly earnest and heartfelt, and there’s no safety valve of comedy or real self-awareness that comedy affords you.”
Odenkirk reflected further on what he’s learned from his sobering performance as Jimmy McGill, a figure now widely recognizable.
“They only know this guy who’s striving, who fails, who gets knocked down, who gets up again. He doesn’t fight, but he never stops — he never stops trying and he’s willing to share his heart and his hopes with the world and address them directly and unironically. And I thought, that’s an action lead… I played that as Saul, and that’s how people knew me. If I could build off that, it would be a neat trick.”
As part of his preparation for the role, which entailed performing stunts entirely by himself, Odenkirk engaged in intense physical training — a departure from his approach to comedic work.
“I didn’t need to do an action movie just to do it. I wanted the full experience, and I wanted to push myself… the hardest thing was the embarrassment of sucking at it for so long and continuing to try.”
Odenkirk had plenty of support in this uncharted territory. “Nobody” is the collaborative effort of multiple veterans of the action genre, including director Ilya Naishuller (“Hardcore Henry”) and writer Derek Kolstad (“John Wick”). Odenkirk spoke particularly highly of the figures behind the camera, expressing gratitude for being “surrounded by pros” as he explored new depths of acting.
“I come from sketch comedy — it was my whole life, it was like a mission for me, and I think there’s people who feel that way about action films. I would include Ilya Naishuller and Derek Kolstad in that. They love action movies like I love sketch comedy, and I didn’t want to make this movie as a dilettante…So we took this character and we pushed him past the easy place that you could have gone and just had a little thrill with him. That was hard — to go into such intense rage — and yet it was also cathartic.”
Having experienced two break-ins of his own, Odenkirk understands Hutch’s desire to fight back and protect those around him. Hutch is a man “boxed in'' by his suburban existence, and Odenkirk noted that such feelings of inadequacy and confinement are particularly resonant in light of the Covid-19 pandemic that has wrought a “similar drudgery and frustration” for so many.
“Somebody said to me the other day, ‘This is a movie I needed, but I didn’t even know I needed it,’ which is a funny thing to say about an action movie. Who needs an action movie? At the core of it, it’s pure escapism. It’s not confrontational of your inner life — it’s meant to be this fantasy that you lose yourself in. But it really seems to be addressing a certain frustration and pent up anger that a lot of people are feeling. And it’s because obviously the pandemic is this thing that you can’t hit, you can’t punch; you can’t take it apart physically, you can’t shoot it. You just have to patiently follow the rules and wait and wait and wait…If there’s something a movie like this can do, it can let you fantasize the feelings inside you and let them go — play them out and feel cleansed of those feelings.”
While continuing to move forward with his other work in comedy and television, Odenkirk was enthusiastic about the prospect of returning to the action genre again in the future. Audiences will be eager to see what comes next.

When high schools face budget cuts, the common warning that the arts will be the first on the chopping block is an unfortunate truth. Add a year-long pandemic that paralyzes the economy and prevents in-person meetings, and the fate of grade school art departments is in even more jeopardy. How can teachers successfully recreate their classroom environments online?
The Lyric Stage Company of Boston, the city’s oldest professional theater company, is aiming to help with the Lyric First Page Playwriting Festival. Students in grades 3-12 in the greater Boston area were able to submit original scripts for the competition.
“Lyric First Page is a virtual education program that we developed for the first time this year to encourage playwriting in youth,” explained Katherine C. Shaver, the program director.
According to Shaver, the festival’s goals are to provide students with more “creative opportunities” and to provide teachers with another classroom tool.
Theater teachers across Boston were able to incorporate Lyric First into their virtual classrooms. Fabiola R. Decius, a teacher at the Josiah Quincy Upper School and one of the evaluators for Lyric First, includes a playwriting unit in her curriculum, and was excited to encourage her students to submit their work.
“When I found out about this, I was like, ‘This will be awesome,’” Decius said.
However, many of her students were “very hesitant.” Decius noted that many of her students felt that they were “not good enough” to enter the competition. Fortunately, two of her students still submitted their scripts.
Jaynice Lorenzo, a senior at The English High School and a competitor, also indicated that her teacher’s support was a driving factor behind her participation. “One thing that motivated me was my teacher, Mr. [Paul] Sedgwick,” Lorenzo said. “He saw the potential that I had and all the hard working I was doing, so he thought that putting my writing out there a little bit more was a great opportunity just to, like, grow as a person.”
Students who submitted to Lyric First Page had the opportunity to receive feedback from a reading committee — a panel of theater professionals — in order to strengthen their playwriting skills. Mayra N. da Costa Pereira, a junior at Josiah Quincy and one of Decius’ students, named character development as a weakness that she was able to recognize.
“In stories, you usually have to keep the character's personality consistent and make sure the characters don't do anything out of order,” she explained. “The entire time, I was like, ‘Wait, is this something that my character would say?’”
Once final edits are completed, Lyric First Page will work with their pool of actors — a mix of Emerson College students who work behind the scenes and actors who frequent their stages — to virtually perform readings of all the plays. “These are professional actors who are lending their voices to these students’ plays,” Shaver said. “Our artistic director Courtney O'Connor was really excited about [it] because she thought seeing these adults, these really seasoned professionals, reading a little kid’s words is delightful.” No matter how delightful these readings will be, for now, shows are limited to friends and families to respect the privacy of the students.
Regarding future iterations of the competition, however, da Costa Pereira remarked “I would love directing it. And maybe could I do both? Like, direct and be in the play? I wouldn't mind that. Because I've always been interested in acting ever since I was little.” All the students interviewed, in fact, expressed interest in further participation in future, in-person competitions.
Nevertheless, the success of this pilot festival and the quality of original submissions have already pleasantly surprised the Lyric First staff, according to Shaver. “I think when kids do stuff, it always exceeds expectations,” she noted. “The plays the kids wrote are so broad, all the way from a ‘living room with my brother and sister’ situation to the future on a starship in space.”
“But the things that matter the most to the students... that’s what they write about,” she added, even if those things are as ordinary as “hanging out with your friends.” Often students wrote about regular, pre-pandemic situations. Jennifer Mei, one of Decius’ ninth-graders at Josiah Quincy, described her play as a chance encounter between “a boy and a girl.” Perhaps scripts like Mei’s reflect a longing for the former everyday interactions that the pandemic has made impossible.
Still, Decius seeks to maintain an engaging virtual classroom with a continued relationship with Lyric First Page and remains optimistic about her students’ growth: “Even though there is a pandemic going on, there are a lot of students who are maturing in ways that it's not always easy to identify.”

Peach Tree Rascals, a band originally from San Jose and now based in Los Angeles, intends to become a household name.
During the Covid-19 summer lockdowns of 2020, the band went viral on TikTok with their single “Mariposa” and has since enjoyed continuous growth in popularity.
Before the start of the pandemic the group was reaching 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. Now, they average over 5 million listeners per month.
“No one's recognizing us or nothing,” group singer-rapper Isaac Pech said. “So blowing up — all it really means is that the people back home think we made it or whatever — that we’re financially secure now. It's a comforting feeling for sure.”
Formed while they were in high school, the band consists of Pech, singer-songwriters Joseph Barros and Tarrek Abdel-Khaliq, producers Jasper Barros and Dominic Pizano, and creative director Jorge Olazaba.
Pech first met the rest of the band at pickup basketball games in San Jose after transferring schools during the second half of his freshman year. The group became close friends and began to make music for fun after school at each other’s houses.
Originally calling themselves “Peach Tree Village,” the band worked and lived together for three years before releasing their debut single, “Glide,” in May 2018.
Abdel-Khaliq credits Pizano with pushing the band towards serious music-making in the early stages of the group’s career. Pizano picked up producing during his first two years of college and quickly committed himself to a career in music, according to Abdel-Khaliq.
“He kind of lit that flame under all of us where — if we were doing this for fun before or for whatever — now we have a brand new mentality of: Let's go and win a championship like the Warriors,” Abdel-Khaliq said.
Basketball metaphors abound: The band says they want nothing less than to be the best.
“We put the team together similar to how the KD-Steph Warriors were built, where you put egos aside and you know what you want,” Pech said. “And you know what it takes to get there.”
All currently living together in a house in Los Angeles, the band agrees that Pizano remains the hardest worker of the group, working on beats every day and night.
“This guy is legit,” Abdel-Khaliq said of Pizano. “The main reason why our music is where it is today. He deserved a break like a year and a half ago, but he's gonna take a little break right now.”
“Yeah, it's not because I want to chill,” Pizano added. “It’s because I actually need to fucking chill.”
With their debut EP “Camp Nowhere” set to be released on Mar. 26, the group hopes to capitalize on the success of “Mariposa,” which currently has over 40 million views on YouTube and 174 million streams on Spotify.
Most of the new project was recorded and written during a two-week trip to Yosemite National Park where Abdel-Khaliq’s family has a vacation cabin. For the past few years, the band has used the cabin as a retreat to rest, recharge, and write music.
The name “Camp Nowhere” comes from the remote location of Yosemite and the social isolation brought on by the pandemic. Inspirations on the project range from Kendrick Lamar and early Chance the Rapper to Kurt Cobain and the Beatles.
“We were put in a position where you can't go anywhere really because of Covid and we're just here making music,” Abdel-Khaliq said. “There’s not really a direction besides the direction that we've always been going in since we started, which is to make really good music, really good records.”
“The best product possible,” Pech chimed in. “Basically, if you need that product, you come to us.”
Yet to play a live show, the band’s plans for a tour were sidelined by the pandemic. Nonetheless, the group says that they always intended to gain significant popularity before performing live and that the TikTok virality of “Mariposa” was a sign that it was time to drop the debut EP.
“When we go on tour, it's going to be everyone singing all the words to our songs and people there who know us and want to see us, rather than if we were to take a more traditional route,” Abdel-Khaliq said.
The group wants to wait on releasing their debut album until their popularity increases even more. By the time the band is ready to record a full-length album, Pech hopes that Peach Tree Rascals will be on the A-list.
“It’s not the time for the album yet because we still need some more followers and more listeners,” Pech said. “I need that shit charting.”
“Charting on Billboard, we’re trying to take over the world,” Abdel-Khaliq added.
Post-pandemic and post-vaccination, the band is eager to get out on the road for a first world tour of their EP and singles.
The group agreed that they will begin and end the tour in San Jose.

On March 19, the highly anticipated “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” debuted on Disney+ with the highest viewership numbers the platform has ever seen. Taking place six months after the events of “Avengers: Endgame,” the first episode of the miniseries follows Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) as they navigate their new lives after the return of half the world’s population and the disbanding of the Avengers. The 1.7 million households that tuned into the first episode were met with fan-favorite characters and their burgeoning backstories, impressive action scenes typical of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and an ultimately enjoyable premiere that sets up the trajectory of the rest of the miniseries and excites audiences for what's to come.
The show opens with Wilson (better known as the Falcon), working with the U.S. Air Force to stop a terrorist group in Tunisia and donating Captain America’s shield, passed down to him in “Endgame,” to the Smithsonian. Meanwhile, a recently pardoned Barnes attempts to build a new, normal life after his time as a brainwashed assassin, attending government-mandated therapy, befriending an elderly man, and going on his first date in nearly a century.
From the beginning, it is obvious that “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” is an action-packed series, filled with both serious moments that move the story forward and perfectly-timed, much-needed comedic relief to offset them. Fans of the MCU will appreciate the opening battle scene in which the Falcon (without a parachute, of course) free falls from a soaring plane, much like Captain America did in “Captain America: The Winter Soldier.” The flashback scene featuring Bucky completing a mission as the Winter Soldier will excite seasoned fans of the universe, reminding them of Bucky’s dark past and just how far he has come since his time as an assassin. The series wastes absolutely no time letting audiences know that — despite being on the same platform that hosts “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” and “Hannah Montana” — this show will not be as family-friendly as some of Disney+’s other offerings. There will be violence, which is fortunately not all gratuitous, and there will be mildly colorful language. It is obvious that this show, beyond reviving fan favorite characters, is truly part of the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and made specifically for its dedicated fans.
While the strong narrative ties to the MCU films and the nostalgic feelings they evoke for fans are one of “The Falcon and The Winter Soldier”’s greatest strengths, they also hold the series back. In attempting to recreate the feelings of watching an MCU film, the premiere feels like an incomplete feature rather than a properly adapted series. Rather than coming to some sort of cinematic resolution, the first episode of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” ends with an unsurprising plot twist that anyone who never read the comics still could have spotted from a mile away. This lack of resolution would be a nonissue if the show was released all at once instead of weekly, allowing audiences to jump into the next episode immediately instead of being left sitting there, mildly disappointed. Even accepting the weekly structure, “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier” could have followed the lead of DIsney+’s wildly successful “WandaVision,” where each episode ends with an individual resolution but still builds towards the overall narrative arc of the entire series.
Further, another downfall of the episode is that there is no interaction between the two titular characters. The episode alternates between scenes of Wilson struggling with the idea of taking on the mantle of Captain America and keeping his family’s fishing business afloat with scenes of a recently pardoned Barnes attempting to build a life. Although this structure allows audiences to catch up with both characters individually and for the two to have the spotlight to themselves for a little while, the amount of screen time they receive is uneven, working in Wilson’s favor rather than Barnes’. Fans are left wondering if/when they are going to get the buddy comedy scenes promised by the show’s trailer.
Despite its disappointments, the episode is overall entertaining, builds anticipation for the rest of the series, and absolutely delivers on its promises of MCU-esque plot and production. Although the episode feels unfinished, this may actually work in its favor and entice audiences to watch the next episode and keep following the story. Furthermore, by keeping Wilson and Barnes apart, the series makes the 1.7 million households who streamed the first episode come back for the second so that the show can finally feel like “The Falcon AND the Winter Soldier” rather than “The Falcon OR the Winter Soldier.” The premiere sets a solid precedent for the rest of the season that signals to fans of the MCU (and, more specifically, the Avengers) that although there are no more Avengers films, there is still more quality MCU content ahead.

Anuksha Savini Wickramasinghe. Without counting all 27 letters, you’ve probably already gotten the sense that my name is long and difficult to pronounce — if pronounceable at all — although I promise you it is. Growing up in the suburbs of Florida, I’ve had the syllables of my name butchered, diced, and boiled into a sad alphabet soup more times than I can imagine.
While going by a nickname has always been a non-negotiable for me, over the years, I have become more confident in correcting people who mispronounce my name. Even now, though, I still find myself worrying about whether it’s rude to correct people who mispronounce my name. I wonder far too often if I should instead just let them mispronounce it until the end of eternity to not make things “awkward,” when in reality, that would admittedly be far more awkward. I’m truly no stranger to the decision calculus of “I guess that’s not terrible,” “it could be worse,” or “at least I recognized that it was my name,” especially as I navigate yet another ice breaker or cold call. My mom and my brother make fun of me for being “insistent” that people say my name correctly — they don’t mind, or even really care if people mispronounce their names. While it is ultimately up to you to decide how much you care about how people pronounce your name, you deserve to have your name said correctly.
Our names are our power. They’re deeply intertwined with our identity, and hold within their sounds a rich personal and cultural heritage. Your name is who you are, and at the simplest level, the primary label by which you identify. After a while of having your name mispronounced, it’s easy to normalize mispronunciations, especially for people of color. Research has shown that negating one’s name can be detrimental to students’ psychological well-being from an early age, causing anxiety, stress, embarrassment, and shame around their name. This, in turn, harms their sense of identity. In effect, name mispronunciation is a microaggression, or a “tiny act of bigotry” as Jennifer Gonzalez defines it. It subtly otherizes already marginalized groups and feeds into a larger system of cultural insensitivity and erasure. In essence, it’s another message that you don’t belong. The mispronunciations build, convincing us that our names, and the significance they carry, are not worthy. Insisting on having your name said correctly is an act of defiance against assimilation, a reclamation of one’s own narrative and identity.
What’s more, name mispronunciation is not an inconsequential mistake, but a widespread phenomenon with pervasive and longstanding effects. Beyond the psychological effects individuals experience, the otherness created by such microaggressions feeds into other areas of marginalization. For example, in Western countries, individuals with non-white names are less likely to receive callbacks for interviews. Instances of refusing to pronounce an individual’s name correctly, especially in mainstream media, also signal that collective society does not value or possess the minimal effort to embrace, let alone accept its diversity. As Hasan Minhaj said on “Ellen” after correcting her mispronunciation of his name, if people can pronounce Ansel Elgort or Timothée Chalamet, they can pronounce Hasan Minhaj. And they can pronounce your name too.
So, you might be thinking — especially if you have an easy to pronounce name — what can you do about mispronunciations? Simple: Ask the person how to pronounce their name correctly. We don’t expect you to get our name on the first try, but your effort in trying to pronounce our names correctly is a simple, yet important, validation of our names, and our identities. As a kid, I would have never envisioned that my name would ever be pronounced correctly during my high school graduation, yet, it was: due to the hours my high school college counselor spent practicing with the school director. Maybe you don’t need to practice someone’s name for hours, but create opportunities for correction — and, crucially, accept corrections as opportunities to learn and grow, instead of as rude or high-maintenance. There are plenty of strategies to learn names, from breaking names down to syllables to associating them with other similar words. If it’s your name that’s difficult to pronounce, or if you know how to pronounce a peer’s name, correct others who mispronounce it.
If you don’t have an easy to pronounce name, unlike my dog, who was intentionally given a simple, two-syllable name to spare her the mispronunciations, learning to love and affirm your full name may have been (or is) a journey. But it’s certainly not mine or yours alone to travel.
As we trek, navigating a world that makes us doubt our names, remember, your name is your power. Your name is one of the first things given to you, and with it, the history and legacy of all those who came before you. Its melodious syllables are yours to fill with stories of triumph and tragedy alike, as you continue to write and define your name and who you are. It represents all that you were, are, and will be.
My name is my power. So say my name. Correctly.

Every Harvard student has probably been warned about the “Harvard bubble,” the tendency to lose awareness of the outside world during their four years on campus.
That bubble often takes on the form of a physical boundary, trapping students for weeks at a time within campus limits. The reasons for this immobility are numerous, with campus obligations being an obvious one.
But almost any undergraduate would also tell you that the costs and difficulties of transportation factor in. For stingy college students, spending nearly $5 on the T or $30 for Uber rides to and from downtown Boston can be the difference between venturing out on a Saturday night and staying in Harvard Square.
Administrators seem to understand how important it is for students to leave campus regularly to explore; the College’s own website includes first-hand testimony from a current student, Marilynn Miguel ’23 touting the benefits of “leaving the Harvard bubble.” Miguel writes eloquently about how her outings to Chinatown and Haymarket helped bring back memories of home.
Yet Harvard does virtually nothing to promote or enable that type of exploration.
Its shuttle system is mostly limited to within-campus movement. Some students can receive a modest MBTA discount, but only when buying a semester-long pass, which costs hundreds of dollars. Harvard’s partnership with Zipcar provides a slight discount, but trips can still be prohibitively expensive.
And the M2 shuttle, the closest thing College students currently have to free transportation off-campus, runs only twice an hour and not late enough into the evening for college sleep schedules. The M2 — which stops in Central and Kendall Squares on its way to the Medical School in Longwood — is often painfully slow during rush hour and doesn’t even get within a mile of Boston Common and many other downtown attractions.
What Harvard students need is a convenient, cheap, and easy way to get around the Boston area, whether to eat, party, or just explore:
Attending political protests in Boston Common or the State House. Experiencing the culinary and cultural diversity of Boston. Taking in Boston’s rich history through the Freedom Trail, abolitionist sites, or Faneuil Hall. Meeting students from other schools in the area. Visiting the Boston Public Library. Volunteering around the city.
A truly fulfilling college experience for many students in the Boston area means exploring one or all of these.
And that exploration could even extend beyond just downtown Boston. Harvard maintains its own 281-acre preserve, the Arnold Arboretum, which could offer a mental and physical respite from classwork to countless students if it were easily accessible.
Yet currently, few are able to take advantage because getting there requires close to an hour of travel on a bus and a subway. Driving there directly takes just over 20 minutes, on the other hand, meaning that if Harvard stepped in and provided a free shuttle (or reimbursed students’ Uber rides), many more would be able to easily and regularly visit.
It’s not as if Harvard doesn’t have a model to follow to make transportation easier for students. For decades, students at colleges across the country have been able to travel on public transportation free of cost. At the University of Pittsburgh, for example, students receive free unlimited rides on any subway or bus line in the city, as do University of Texas students.
In fact, an arrangement between dozens of schools and local transit agencies across the nation, called Unlimited Access, has provided more than 800,000 university affiliates with fare-free service as of 2001. The average cost of Unlimited Access for the universities was just $30 per student per year, a figure that would likely be even lower for a school like Harvard without student commuters.
At the end of the day, Harvard must decide whether it wants to help students pop the bubble the University itself helps create, or continue to deny them ample, affordable transportation options.
Sitting in the middle of a vibrant metropolitan area teeming with history, culture, and attractions, Harvard students would benefit immensely from being better connected to their environs. Harvard itself needs to start showing its nearly 400-year-old hometown a bit more appreciation, whether that’s paying its fair share of taxes or not producing rapid gentrification in Allston.
The University can start by giving students the ability to develop a love for the Boston area and a desire to stay here and make it better, rather than seeing the city through a purely transactional lens.
The only question left is: What is Harvard waiting for?

Harvard researchers published a revised model of the early Martian environment that could explain how life may have emerged on Mars in Nature Geoscience earlier this month.
The Harvard-led research team — in collaboration with Brown University, California Institute of Technology, Stony Brook University, and NASA — proposed that Mars once boasted a dynamic environment characterized by long cold periods interspersed with episodes of warmth.
Today, 3.5 billion years later, Mars is known to be very cold and dry. Its desolate environment is inhospitable to life: liquid water is nearly, if not wholly, nonexistent, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere that gives the planet its familiar reddish tinge is hostile to the early biosynthesis required for life — historically thought to be only possible in oxygen-poor atmospheres.
Over the years, though, NASA rovers have found geological evidence that points toward the past presence of flowing liquid water and minerals that form only in oxygen-poor environments, suggesting that the planet once had conditions to support early life.
The researchers modeled Mars’ climate and atmospheric chemistry, actually finding “fluctuations” between these oxygen-poor — or reducing — and oxygen-rich — or oxidizing — conditions over time, according to Robin D. Wordsworth, lead author and Harvard professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.
The fluctuating presence or absence of oxygen on Mars would have affected its climate over time, according to Wordsworth. Because oxygen is a poor greenhouse gas, the Martian atmosphere would have trapped less heat during its oxygen-rich periods. Oxygen-poor periods, however, were characterized by a greater abundance of hydrogen gas, which — in combination with carbon dioxide — would have acted as a “potent” greenhouse gas and more efficiently retained heat.
“There is a current popular hypothesis for warming early Mars in a reducing environment with a lot of hydrogen. This paper suggests that the early Martian climate didn’t need to be primarily oxidizing or reducing; that oscillating between these environments is possible,” Kathryn E. Steakley, NASA postdoctoral program fellow and contributor to the paper, wrote in an emailed statement.
“We don’t know if life ever emerged on Mars,” Wordsworth said. “But what our model does show, if this scenario is correct, is that you have episodic periods where the surface is warm, and the chemistry is conducive to early forms of life — but then long periods where the surface is cold and oxidizing.”
Because fluctuations back to an biochemically hostile, oxygen-rich atmosphere would have been harmful to early developing life forms, Wordsworth said that “if life did emerge, it would have best survived in the subsurface of Mars rather than continuously on the surface.”
The next steps for the team include testing their model with data collected by NASA’s Perseverance rover — which landed in the Jezero Crater of the red planet last month. They will examine both materials on site and rock samples sent back to Earth via a rover provided by the European Space Agency, with a current launch date of 2026.
“It’s an incredibly ambitious mission — the most complicated thing that NASA and ESA have tried to do together, with the possible exception of the Apollo missions,” Wordsworth said. “Science-wise, it’s going to be phenomenal. It’s just going to revolutionize our understanding of the Martian surface.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Medical School researchers found that increasing the number of primary care physicians in underserved areas may boost life expectancies, according to a study published Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine.
The study analyzed primary care physician density and population mortality data from 3,104 U.S. counties between 2010 and 2017. Based on that data, researchers projected that increasing the number of primary care providers in a county without sufficient healthcare resources would lead to a 9 percent increase in life expectancy.
Sanjay Basu, the corresponding author of the study and Director of Research at the HMS Center for Primary Care, said a 9 percent improvement in life expectancy is “pretty dramatic.”
“That’s at the level of what we see from reductions in smoking, for example tobacco smoking, in prior years,” Basu said. “It’s much bigger than all the innovations that have happened in cancer therapy — in history.”
Russell S. Phillips, the director of the HMS Center for Primary Care and co-author of the study, said the findings highlight the fact that “primary care saves lives.”
Basu noted that the effectiveness of increasing the number of primary care physicians varies based on the socioeconomic contexts of different regions.
“If you had one more doctor in Boston, it doesn’t make that much of an impact,” Basu said. “If you add one more doctor in the Central Valley of California, it makes much more population impact. It’s because they’re starting from such a low level.”
Despite the life-saving potential of primary care, Phillips said there is a “dramatic shortage” in primary care physicians across the country.
“What was surprising to me is how many doctors we actually need, or how many primary care clinicians we need in underserved counties to really optimize life expectancy and mortality — and came up with a number of almost 95,000,” he said.
Shari M. Erickson, the vice president for governmental affairs and medical practice of the American College of Physicians, said many primary care practices were forced to shut down or cut back due to their inability to manage the increased volume of need during Covid-19.
Phillips, a primary care physician himself, said he believes the pandemic has “emphasized the importance of primary care” because many patients’ first contact with a physician is often their primary care doctor. Many primary care providers have thus been “overwhelmed” by patients seeking care for Covid-19.
Basu said some changes are already being made to health care policies across the country. Medicare, for instance, is starting to implement “value-based payments” in which physicians are paid for the quality of their service rather than quantity of visits.
“It tries to align financial incentives with actual health improvements, rather than doing more visits, even if those are actually improving health,” Basu said.
Massachusetts is currently drafting legislation that would allow every resident to access primary care, according to Wayne J. Altman, a professor of family medicine at Tufts University Medical School.
“If we apply this article to this population of people, we’re extending people’s lives, just by virtue of having care, not to mention the fact that we’re going to decrease cost of overall care and decrease health disparities by providing that access,” Altman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced Thursday she will shut down Harvard’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics after determining that its director, Mathematics and Biology professor Martin A. Nowak, violated several University policies through his extensive contacts with convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.
Nowak will be barred from serving as Principal Investigator on any new grants or contracts for two years. Additionally, he will not be permitted to take on new advisees — undergraduate, graduate, or doctoral — during that period, though he will continue to teach undergraduate courses.
The sanctions — which Gay announced publicly in a Thursday afternoon email to faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows in the Mathematics and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology departments — come almost a year after she placed Nowak on paid administrative leave after a University review found he had extensive, previously unreported contact with Epstein.
In her email Thursday, Gay stated Nowak violated several Harvard policies, including the FAS Professional Conduct Policy and policies concerning campus access, among others. She also wrote that Nowak’s behavior toward Epstein, as well as relationship with him, was unbecoming of a faculty member.
“In instances where his actions did not constitute policy violations per se, those actions still demonstrated a pattern of blameworthy negligence and unprofessional behavior in his responsibilities as director of PED and as a member of the FAS community,” she wrote. “In my role as FAS Dean, I have determined that sanctions are warranted.”
The Program for Evolutionary Dynamics will be shut down “as soon as it is feasible” and Nowak’s research will be shifted into the Math department, she wrote.
At the end of two years, Gay will decide whether to restore Nowak’s research and advising privileges taken away Thursday.
Nowak did not respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.
Nowak’s connections to Epstein first came under public scrutiny when a University review — initiated by University President Lawrence S. Bacow in September 2019 — found Nowak facilitated Epstein’s attempts to use Harvard as a tool to rehabilitate his image following his 2008 conviction for solicitation of minors for prostitution.
In 2006, The Crimson found that Epstein donated $6.5 million to the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics — the largest single donation Epstein made to Harvard. The University report found that between 2010 and 2018, PED welcomed Epstein to its office more than 40 times, while Nowak approved the posting of flattering and false descriptions of Epstein’s support for Harvard on the PED website.
Gay wrote Thursday that enforcing Harvard policies is “essential” to establishing a “safe, fair, and respectful environment” conducive to academic exchange.
“Operating in a manner consistent with our policies, norms, and standards is one of the fundamental obligations we must each fulfill as members of the Faculty,” she wrote.
“The sanctions described above are proportionate to the severity of the behavior observed and seek to uphold and further our shared community standards, while keeping the way open to productivity and improvement,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Divinity School faculty voted late last year to approve a statement asking University President Lawrence S. Bacow and the Harvard Management Company to divest Harvard’s holdings in the private prison industry, Divinity School Acting Dean David F. Holland announced Wednesday.
Holland’s announcement comes three months after HDS faculty officially voted to send the following statement to Bacow and officials in charge of the University’s endowment.
“The Faculty of Divinity ask President Bacow and the HMC to divest the endowment’s financial holdings from carceral corporations that constitute the prison-industrial complex,” the statement reads.
HDS student activists urged faculty to adopt an official stance on prison divestment in a letter to the school's faculty in October 2020.
“Harvard’s investment in prisons is unconscionable,” the activists’ letter reads. “We request that HDS demonstrate its commitment to anti-racist, anti-xenophobic, anti-colonialist, anti-transphobic, anti-homophobic, anti-misogynist work by placing a vote to officially endorse divestment on the agenda for the faculty meeting on Monday, November 2, 2020.”
The HDS faculty did not vote on the student activists’ request in their November meeting, but the vote eventually took place on Dec. 7. Holland wrote in a letter to organizers following the vote that the Faculty Council would review how it can work to influence University and HMC officials on adopting a divestment measure.
“Faculty Council asked me, as the acting dean, to begin a process of exploring among faculty and with the central administration the possibility of such structural improvements within the HMC,” Holland wrote. “I have begun that process immediately.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed that Harvard is aware of the HDS faculty vote, but declined to comment further. Divinity School spokesperson Michael P. Naughton declined to elaborate on Wednesday’s announcement.
Bacow has long held the position that pushing for divestment — whether from fossil fuels or from private prisons — is not an appropriate way to advocate for social change.
“The University should not use the endowment...to achieve political ends or particular policy ends,” he said in 2018. “There are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don’t think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.”
Four Divinity School students behind the campaign to push for a faculty vote — Eboni R. Nash, Melissa A. Cedillo, Azani A. Creeks, and Sarah B. Kissel — wrote in a joint statement Thursday that they hope the HDS announcement motivates other Harvard schools to adopt similar measures.
“We anticipate that, following HDS’s lead, other Schools within Harvard will publicly support divestment as well, creating institutional momentum necessary to advance the effort all the way to the interior circles of Harvard’s financial management,” the statement reads. “We look forward to continuing our work with students, alumni, community members, faculty, and administration to reduce harm perpetuated by the institution as it continues to profit from legacies of slavery and injustice.”
The Divinity School vote marks the first time a Harvard school’s faculty has taken an official stance on private prison divestment, though the faculty of several schools — including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences — have urged the University to divest from fossil fuels. A Crimson survey of the FAS in February found that 74 percent of respondents agreed that Harvard should divest from companies tied to private prisons, including 50 percent of respondents who “strongly agree.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard College conducts alumni interviews for applicants to the Class of 2025 virtually due to the pandemic, applicants and interviewers alike reported mixed feelings about the unconventional circumstance.
Though the number of applications to the College has significantly increased this admissions cycle, the number of interview volunteers – more than 10,000 alumni – has remained the same. While the College tells applicants who do not undergo interviews that they will not be disadvantaged during the admissions process, virtual interviews may allow more applicants an opportunity for an interview.
In previous years – depending on geographical location and alumni availability – alumni reached out to candidates to coordinate interviews. Interviews typically took place at a nearby public location, such as a coffee shop or park, explained Benjamin N. “Ben” Levy ’69, an interviewer in Massachusetts.
“I usually invite the interview to meet me in Harvard Square, and we talk in the COOP on the balcony there or the tables, or we go over to the Smith Center and sit down there at a table and have a conversation,” Levy said of his pre-pandemic interactions with applicants.
Lina S. Scroggins ’05, who interviews applicants from Arkansas, said she believes the virtual nature of alumni interviews allowed alums to connect with more students than in previous years.
“We could reach people that we wouldn’t otherwise have reached,” she said. “In the past, we may have struggled to conduct live interviews for everybody because of the number of interviewers that were available and the locations from which applicants came.”
Rachel Mobaraka, an applicant from Lancaster, Calif., said she believes she would not have had an alumni interview without the online format due to distance, calling the interview “a matter of convenience.”
“He’s in San Diego, and that’s about four hours away from me,” Mobaraka said. “He had messaged me on a Friday and then my interview was the next day at 10 a.m., so there was no way I could have gone to San Diego at that time.”
The move from in-person to a virtual platform has presented new challenges for some applicants, though, such as internet connection problems, difficulties reading the interviewers’ body language, and background noise, they said.
Marion Kokkinou – an international applicant from Nicosia, Cyprus – said though her online interview with an alum from Cyprus spared her the potential expense of traveling to Harvard for an interview with an admissions officer, she still experienced problems interviewing over Zoom.
“I have the fear of the connection getting cut,” Kokkinou said. “Also, at the time of the interview, there was some noise from the outside because they were doing construction work, so that was a problem.”
Even with those problems, some students said they preferred the online setting. Kathy K. Zhong, an applicant from Columbus, Ohio – whose interviewer called her from Boston – said the interview felt “just like any other conversation.”
“I would have preferred online honestly, because an in-person interview seems quite daunting,” Zhong said.
Zara Dhar, an applicant from Stevenson Ranch, Calif., said she hopes the College will continue using online interviews even once the pandemic ends.
“Maybe other people won’t have the resources to be able to drive themselves to an interview or get parents to commute, and then interviewers themselves might find it easier to host interviews when they’re not working out places to meet,” Dhar said.
Though Levy said he would be willing to conduct interviews over Zoom in the future, he said he looks forward to once again interacting with applicants in person.
“I wouldn’t mind pitching in if there were people from other parts of the country or, even other nations,” Levy said. “But for those who are applying locally, I’d much prefer to meet them in-person.”
The College will release admissions decisions for the Class of 2025 on April 6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A dozen student organizations signed onto an open letter criticizing University President Lawrence S. Bacow for instructing Harvard affiliates in an email last week to contact the University’s police force if they have knowledge of a “racist attack.”
Bacow’s March 18 email condemned the recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and came the day after a 21-year-old gunman killed eight people — including six Asian women — at three Atlanta-area spas.
Bacow also addressed the recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes during the last year. Since March 2020, 3,795 anti-Asian hate crimes have been reported in the United States, according to data published this month by the reporting center Stop AAPI Hate.
In his email, Bacow urged affiliates to contact the Harvard University Police Department to report incidents of racism.
“Each of us can offer comfort and support to members of our community who are feeling targeted and vulnerable,” Bacow wrote. “As always, if you or someone you know has experienced a racist attack, please contact the Harvard University Police Department. You may also share concerns by submitting an anonymous report through the University’s dedicated hotline.”
Student organizers wrote in their open letter, however, that they consider HUPD an “unacceptable and harmful remedy” to anti-Asian violence at the University. In the letter, which is addressed to Harvard affiliates, the authors cited The Crimson’s 2020 investigation into HUPD, which found repeated incidents of racism and sexism within the force spanning the past three decades.
Since The Crimson’s initial investigation, Bacow has set in motion several reviews of the University’s police department.
The open letter condemned Bacow for encouraging affiliates to seek recourse for racism through HUPD.
“President Bacow used Tuesday’s shootings to validate HUPD’s existence and justify their continued threat of violence,” the letter states. “HUPD is an unacceptable and harmful remedy to anti-Asian violence in our community.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Bacow supports Harvard’s Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander affiliates.
“President Bacow voiced his support for Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders in our community and will continue to stand with them, as he said, ‘today and every day going forward,’” Newton wrote.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Student organizations that signed onto the letter include the Undergraduate Council, Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, Harvard College Black Students Association, Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, and Harvard College South Asian Women’s Collective.
Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, a member of the South Asian Women’s Collective and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better, said she and students spanning various student organizations drafted the letter to convey their shared outrage over Bacow’s statement.
“We wanted to be clear about the collective stance of a lot of the organizations in that group and that coalition, basically to say that policing is not an appropriate response and an increase in policing is not an appropriate response, especially from the University,” Mahajan said.
“Police are all tied to not only racism but also sexism — a history of not helping with sexual- and gender-based violence and often exacerbating it and being involved in the fault themselves,” she added.
Harvard Law School student Marina L. Multhaup, who helped draft the letter, said she believes HUPD cannot keep students safe from anti-Asian violence, calling such a notion “contradictory.”
Multhaup cited HUPD’s presence at a Boston protest against racial violence last summer, which sparked student backlash.
“There is absolutely no indication that HUPD has ever responded in a positive manner toward racialized violence or has ever prevented racialized violence from occurring,” she said.
Given recent reports of racism and sexism within HUPD, Mahajan said she was surprised and displeased to read Bacow’s guidance to affiliates.
“It seems quite ridiculous for me to hear that after a year of what has been quite a reckoning with police brutality and state violence, enhanced by the police,” Mahajan said. “It’s surprising to me with the both national and local context that President Bacow could make a statement that links some safety to police especially in the case of racist attacks.”
Harvard Medical School student Lynn Hur, another organizer behind the letter, called Bacow’s reference to HUPD “insensitive and inadequate,” given that students — some of whom had previously called for HUPD’s abolition — were “grieving and mourning.”
“I think this just speaks to how little the University has been listening to us because repeatedly, various student organizations have called upon them to not only defund and demilitarize HUPD, but abolish it,” Hur said. “It was just a complete slap in the face, reading that email.”
Multhaup said she hopes the open letter sends a message to University administrators that HUPD does not provide a solution to “deep, racialized violence.”
“We need fundamental changes to how we, as a Harvard society, exist with ourselves and with our surrounding community to fix these problems,” she said.

In a step forward for renewable energy storage, researchers in Harvard’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology have accomplished the continuous splitting of impure water into pure hydrogen and oxygen gas by leveraging a process called forward osmosis, according to an article published earlier this month.
The article, titled “Continuous electrochemical water splitting from natural water sources via forward osmosis,” was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on March 2. In the paper, Samuel S. Veroneau, first author and a Chemistry Ph.D. candidate, and Daniel G. Nocera, a professor in the department widely known for his work on renewable energy, outline their use of forward osmosis and electrochemical water splitting to generate hydrogen gas, which is effective in storing renewable energy.
Veroneau said he and Nocera built upon the natural process of osmosis in order to split impure water from natural sources like the ocean.
“If you put a grape in the ocean, it’ll start to shrivel up as osmosis begins to take place,” Veroneau explained.
Currently, hydrogen generation from water requires the use of purified water, which necessitates “huge multibillion dollar reverse osmosis desalination facilities,” Veroneau said. He and Nocera’s method allows for the use of impure water, so there is no need for a separate water purification system.
As a result, a key benefit of this method is driving down the cost of building hydrogen generation plants, an important factor for developing nations, Nocera said.
“You can use any water source, and you can do it in a very distributed way,” Nocera said. “That’s the type of energy you need to get to the poor: renewable energy that can be done in a distributed way.”
The argument in favor of fossil fuels largely involves their relatively low cost and their efficiency in storing energy, and a major challenge has been “trying to recapitulate that benefit in renewable energies,” Veroneau said. The forward osmosis method, however, matches the benefits of fossil fuels with its low costs and efficiency.
A common misconception, Nocera said, is that this process will use up all of the planet’s water sources in order to store energy.
“When you split [water], you’re using sunlight, you’ve stored the energy in the rearranged bonds of water to make hydrogen and oxygen, so when you recombine them, you get that energy back and water back,” Nocera said.
Nocera added that the researchers are working with the U.S. Navy to use oxygen gas — the other product of water splitting — to “get more breathable oxygen” out of seawater.
Looking forward, Veroneau said he hopes to improve the practicality of their research.
“We made this with 15 milliliters of water, and if you want to do this on the scale of the globe you need millions of Olympic swimming pools worth of water, so our part in this is making it as good as we can with our little test tubes in the lab,” he said.
Nocera is also widely known for inventing the bionic leaf, which artificially simulates photosynthesis in order to create renewable fuel.
“In the bionic leaf there’s an organism. It eats hydrogen from water splitting, and then it breathes carbon dioxide in from the air, and it combines hydrogen and carbon dioxide and it makes a fuel,” Nocera said.
The forward osmosis method “dovetails” with the bionic leaf by supplying the organism with hydrogen gas from impure water sources, he added.
The scientists said they hope their research will ultimately help developing nations establish sources of renewable energy.
“You can’t have a sustainable planet if you’re ignoring the poor,” Nocera said. “I usually say their voice is a whisper, but it’s going to be a cacophony because of numbers in the next 30 to 40 years, and nobody’s listening.”
“So in our research, we try to listen to that whisper of a voice that we know is going to be a megaphone in 30 years,” he said. “The goal of our research is to try to answer that — not just answer renewable energy, it’s renewable energy for the poor and the poor parts of the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Southern Poverty Center President and CEO Margaret Huang and gun control activist Shannon Watts discussed the recent rise in anti-Asian violence and the mass shooting in Atlanta last week at a Wednesday Harvard Kennedy School webinar.
The mass shooting, which took place on March 16, targeted three spas and left eight dead— six of whom were Asian women.
Moderated by Sushma Raman, Executive Director of the HKS Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, the panel explored how the uptick in anti-Asian sentiment amid the Covid-19 pandemic created an environment conducive to openly committing acts of violence against Asian Americans.
Huang shared data published by the reporting center Stop AAPI Hate that found nearly 4,000 incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans since the beginning of the pandemic.
She expressed disappointment that law enforcement has yet to classify the Atlanta shooting as a hate crime and added that the SPLC will push for more thorough documentation of hate crimes.
“Sadly, we have seen a lot of hesitation in the shootings in Atlanta, but we will continue to push for stronger hate crimes documentation across the country, because it affects so many different communities,” Huang said.
Watts, who founded Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, discussed how gun violence against women — especially women of color — could be tempered by more stringent federal regulation of gun laws.
“Strengthening our gun laws at the state and federal levels, like passing background checks. reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act — those things go a long way toward protecting women right now,” Watts said.
She added that the recent shooting in Atlanta and Monday’s shooting in Boulder, Colo. are a “deadly outcome” of “allowing gun lobbyists to write our gun laws.”
Huang gave a brief history of anti-Asian racism in the United States from the 19th century to the present. She said stereotypes of Asian women as “docile or servile,” particularly in regard to sex work, contribute to a “patriarchial violence narrative.”
“If you look at any of the other examples of some of these terrible mass shootings, it is not hard to find misogyny and violence against women in nearly all of them,” Huang said.
Watts added that Asian American and Pacific Islander women face a “triple threat of misogyny, racism, gun violence.”
“Last week in Georgia, the victims were mostly AAPI women, a community that has long faced the triple threat of misogyny, racism, gun violence,” Watts said. “In the last year, this threat has just continued to grow.”
To make headway on progress, Watts said gun control advocates should speak out against the “vocal minority” who largely influence gun policy.
“When we talk about how do we change hearts and minds, it’s really getting what has been a silent majority, to be a vocal majority, so that they have more power and control than this — what has been for so long — a vocal minority that has held sway over so many of our laws, including gun laws,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over one year ago, the Ivy League cancelled all spring sports due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. While virtually all other sports institutions in the country would soon follow suit, the Ivy League was the first to make such a drastic move. Today, one March later, the Ivy League is still not playing while other leagues, both collegiate and professional, trudge forward.
The heartbreak for fans, my fellow sports reporters, and — most of all — athletes, continues as the Ancient Eight remains sidelined. As I sat in my dorm with only weeks left in college, I reminisced of the days when I would travel the East Coast with my fellow writers and cover Ivy League sports. Our sports board GroupMe remains active, however, and I realized that while sports remained paused, the campuses were still alive, even if in remote fashion. Even without our beloved athletics, the show goes on.
Maybe it’s just the graduation goggles, but I realized that I don’t need football to do one of my favorite things as a Crimson reporter: write my Around the Ivies column. While they sometimes contained football analysis, they often didn’t, relying equally on quotes from Churchill and Batman. Although it may be harder to berate the Brown football program — don’t worry, I still will — the Ancient Eight is still alive even without sports. So without further ado, let’s take one last trip Around the Ivies.
BROWN
Thanks to alphabetical order, Brown finds itself somewhere it never could during the football season: the top. Now that I have met my contractual obligations to insult Bears football, I’d like to take this chance to uncharacteristically praise Brown in my last tour Around the Ivies. I admit, I have beaten up on Brown during my reporting career: stating that they would benefit from an exploding playing surface, likening a possible win to Joker-level chaos, assuring losses with the utmost guarantee, referring to a Brown win as “basically against the laws of nature,” claiming they would go winless, calling their subsequent win “a blind squirrel finding a nut,” and even saying that my high school football team could defeat them by three touchdowns while picking Princeton to win by 63 points (the Tigers scored 65). As my Crimson career comes to a close, however, I hope it isn’t too late to ask for forgiveness.
Brown is home to the greatest invention known to higher education: the Open Curriculum. For the uninitiated or soon to be lustful, Brown University offers an Open Curriculum plan that requires virtually no general education courses, allowing students to personally craft their own path. As I sit in my very last semester, I am especially envious. I expected to enjoy my post-thesis nirvana on a cruise to graduation. Sadly, I am forced to trudge through my final general education requirement thanks to poor planning that surely would have slid by in an Open Curriculum.
So here’s to you, Brown. You truly are the best of us in curriculum design, meaning the football cellar is only an equitable destination for the Bears. I apologize for four years of constant berating, and hope that you may share your amazing program with other institutions of higher learning that have much to learn from you. I sit in equal awe and jealousy.
COLUMBIA
While official athletics have been nearly non-existent at the Ivy League schools since the pandemic began, sports reporters have technically been allowed to operate, despite a lack of events. The slowing of my journalism career as it comes to its anticlimactic end serves as evidence of this phenomenon.
At Columbia, however, the sports journalism space is much more complicated. Following the 2018 board elections for Columbia’s version of The Crimson, an unfortunate process we share referred to as the “Turkey Shoot,” a majority of the sports board of the paper resigned in protest. For years, the paper’s election process had been criticized for unfairness and shrouded in mystery. Columbia’s version of The Crimson — or the Columbia Spectator, if you prefer — was left mostly without a sports staff.
The newly unemployed sports writers formed their own website, The Change-Up, designed as a Ringer-type blog. As a fellow sports journalist, I commend these brave souls. Sports journalism on these campuses is sometimes cast to the background by others who consider themselves more important, and founding your own organization on a campus where a storied school newspaper reigns supreme is no easy undertaking.
Unfortunately for the revolutionaries, The Change-Up seemed to have trouble staying out of the dirt. They haven’t published a story in a long while, and were posting articles with decreasing frequency even before the pandemic cancelled Ancient Eight sports. Columbia’s version of The Crimson, funny enough, never even reported on the incident. Thanks to noticeably empty seats and friendly conversation in the press box during the Columbia-Harvard football game last fall, it seemed that The Change-Up had become practically defunct.
Columbia’s version of The Crimson, however, seems to somewhat have a sports staff back and has, without needing to rush to cover sports thanks to the break, built back a relative foundation for coverage. A sports story has even highlighted the website’s home page recently! From personal experience, this takes a certain dedication. Sports clearly still mean something in the Big Apple, something to be proud of at a time in which we have been deprived for so long.
CORNELL
Ithaca is as close to the geographical description of “socially distant” as I can think of. I will not, however, harp too much on upstate New York’s sparse population density. This is partly because I now have a couple of very close friends from the area whom I often go to great lengths to annoy, but mostly because I sympathize with the fact that they still have approximately four months of winter left while spring has sprung in the Boston area.
Speaking of population density, the area is grappling with important questions on the subject. The Village of Lansing, just north of Cornell and the City of Ithaca — I know what you’re thinking, and I also have no clue how it’s legally considered a “city” — recently held a public debate regarding the zoning of a 25-acre empty property. Lansing’s Board of Trustees is considering re-labeling the property from medium density residential (MDR) zoning to high density residential (HDR) zoning.
I only bring this up to ask two questions. Firstly, I previously assumed that 25 acres of undeveloped property in the Ithaca area was simply everyone’s backyard of snow instead of an economic opportunity; is this not true? Secondly, what qualifies as “high density residential zoning” in upstate New York? I figured that just means a family of more than four, so I guess you learn something new every day.
DARTMOUTH
I should have saved my “socially distant” joke for Hanover, it’s a shame that I write these in one take. I refuse to lazily repeat jokes about the wilderness that is New Hampshire, so I’ll leave it at that.
In Big Green sports news, the golf team has found itself recently homeless. The school cut five sports teams, including men’s and women’s golf, and permanently closed the Hanover Country Club last July. The teams, however, were fortunately reinstated in January. The reinstatement of the teams is, in and of itself, a triumph. Especially during the pandemic, sports at colleges across the country have sadly been cut for financial and logistical reasons. Seeing Dartmouth reinstate teams is clearly a welcome sight.
The Hanover Country Club, however, remains closed, and the teams have spent the past two months searching for a new home. Admittedly, I am concerned for Dartmouth golf. If you click on the hyperlinked story in the previous sentence, you can see that the old course was still covered in mounds of snow into March. I can only assume that the snow will take time, likely well into the golf season, to melt for acceptable play. I extend an invitation to Dartmouth's teams to practice with me this year, as I plan to live on the Cleveland Metroparks Golf Courses from my (virtual) graduation to the start of northeastern Ohio snow in October.
PENN
I usually write this column during the football season, allowing me to easily use the Philadelphia Eagles as written cannon fodder. Unfortunately, I was out of commission this fall without Ivy League football, when the Eagles were perhaps at their most vulnerable. For now, I’ll simply thank the Eagles for our new Colts quarterback, Carson Wentz. Please let last year be the mixed outlier result of a pandemic fluke and Philly’s egregiously porous offensive line.
It is, however, no longer football season. It’s basketball season, and that’s all Philadelphia seems to care about at the moment. The Sixers are on top of the world, and the City of Brotherly Love is loving being the leaders of the NBA’s Eastern Conference, so the professional sports world in Philadelphia gets a pass.
The students at Penn should also feel better about the transition to spring. The University creatively engaged in “Spring Stay” instead of spring break, organizing outdoors-focused programs throughout the campus and the city in order to give students a well-earned break from class without having to engage in risky pandemic travel.
The Spring Stay was only two days, but still served as an actual break from classes. To fill the gap, Penn gave students three additional “Engagement Days” throughout the semester. Harvard has a similar system, albeit sans Spring Stay, spreading five “Wellness Days” throughout the semester that professors barely protect, since they’re really just homework days. So congrats to the students at Penn, I hope you enjoyed your mini-spring break. In my final spring semester, I definitely could have used one. The Class of 2021 clearly has it hardest among college students right now, despite what some first-years may think.
PRINCETON
Princeton also received a nice mini-spring break, while the nation had a short-lived romance with a fellow New Jersey school. Rutgers won its first NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament game since 1983 with a victory over Clemson earlier this week, grabbing the nation’s attention. Despite a heartbreaking loss in the second round to Houston, the resurgence brought back some fantastic Sopranos throwbacks on Twitter, and for that I thank the Garden State.
While Rutgers has captured the hearts of underdog-lovers across the country, I would be remiss if I did not turn my attention back to the underdog heroes in the Princeton area. City engineers recently announced that changing the direction of South Tulane Street, a one-way side-street on the north edge of Princeton’s campus, would be impossible. If you’ve never been to the area, this means absolutely nothing. If you’ve been stuck in the pouring rain while your co-writer dashes back to the car as you start hour seven (out of 12 total) of driving for the day following a heartbreaking Harvard defeat in Princeton Stadium while sitting on the one-way South Tulane Street as a safe haven from the madness of a rainy, post-game Nassau Street, then this is fantastic news.
That day also served as the first time I had to watch someone pump my gas for me, an absolutely bizarre concept for a Kentuckian, or anyone from 48 particular states for that matter. That being said, I do want to cut New Jersey state policymakers a big break. They seem to really know what they’re doing lately.
YALE
Yale always seems to follow Harvard. It was founded 65 years after Harvard, and the catchup continues. While a reliable jab on our campus, they truly did blindly follow us before the last Harvard-Yale football game (a tradition I will surely miss, I’m glad I got my second year of promised New Haven pizza and Yale dorm hopping, for that I am forever grateful to our brethren in Connecticut). Us football writers always trade “trash talk” columns from our most senior writer, with the articles published in each other’s respective papers. Yale’s version of the Crimson blindly printed the story from my former co-writer, Cade Palmer ‘20. Instead of a normal trash talk column, however, Cade had included a hidden message from the first letter of each sentence, severely duping our Bulldog friends.
It seems, however, that Yale is attempting to jump the gun ahead of Harvard in one regard: shopping week. Yale recently announced the official termination of its shopping period, one that had been under review for some time. As Harvard continues its assault on our shopping week, I plead them not to follow Yale. Does my shopping week usually just cause me intense stress related to class lotteries and enrollment deadlines? Sure. But it was here when I got here, and it means something to me (RIP Harvard Time, even as your last class graduates, we’ll never forget you). Please don’t just blindly follow our neighbors to the south, soon enough we’ll be posting hidden conspiracy theories in our newspaper, too.
Speaking of conspiracy theories, Yale was recently paid a visit from infamous (emphasis on the “in-”) conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. I have negative interest in the content of his visit, but the picture posted on the website of Yale’s version of The Crimson caught my eye. Apparently, Jones films his segments on the same device that I make memes regarding the dining hall’s lunch on: an iPhone. While I’m busy asking Harvard not to follow Yale’s last week, let’s just file this situation in the same folder. No need for me to see Alex outside my dorm anytime soon.
HARVARD
When I usually sit down to write these columns, I start by scanning the other schools’ student newspapers. It usually isn’t that hard to find something hilarious to parody going on in the area (especially if you focus on the sections titled “Editorial”). While I attempted to praise my fellow Ivy League institutions that I respect greatly this time around, I still couldn’t help taking a few pot shots. On the contrary, the Harvard section usually contains some type of pre-game ribbing aimed at the school facing our football team that week.
But there is no football this week, and there haven’t been any Ivy League athletics for a really long time. In fact, the sports mood in the area has been as dismal as I’ve ever seen it. I’ve lived here through multiple championship parades, but you wouldn’t think so judging by the current sports climate. The Pats just finished their worst year since I was in diapers. The Bruins have had a tough last month and a half. The Red Sox find themselves underdogs in the division to the league’s 26th largest payroll and the Canadians, not to mention the hype surrounding the you know whos in New York. And the Celtics are probably the only people on the planet that actually wish it were still 2020.
Did I just spend my chance to ferociously attack Harvard instead bashing Boston sports, an institution I’ve rooted against my entire life anyways? Yes. But that’s because I’ve genuinely loved all my time here. Comedic satire has separated this column from the designation of downright insulting for years, and in my last go, I’ll keep my blind partisanship alive. I’ve loved every moment spent with my dear friends at this school, and the time spent writing and playing pick-up with the best sportswriters in the country at 14 Plympton. One of them will soon take up my mantle, and spend countless hours writing ridiculous columns under the guise of touring “Around the Ivies” for a readership that probably doesn’t include people that I don’t directly send the link to. And I hope they love it as much as I did.

Disclaimer: There are many grocery stores in the great city of Cambridge and if your favorite one didn’t make this round up, we really mean no harm. Since Flyby is all about #lifehacks, here’s a list of stores you can hit up in under 10 minutes — whether it’s by walk, shuttle, T, or delivery!
Trader Joe’s
We love this store more than ec concentrators love stonks. Trader Joe’s is the home of fabulous snacks for unbeatable prices. Every day, we hope our unofficial-brand-ambassador status will become official, but we are yet to succeed in this endeavor. Till then, we leave you with our go-to items: dried mango, brownie brittle, fake Takis, and literally ANY frozen dinner. Note: there are a few different TJs in the area so take your pick!
Wholesome Fresh
You’ve probably walked past this store on Church Street a million times and never noticed it. Wholesome Fresh is a small but sophisticated grocery store with fruit, snacks, and basics like bread and milk. We’ll admit they’re a little expensive — actually a lot expensive — but you’re paying for the proximity. And if you’re feeling lazy, they’ve even got a deli and hot breakfast!
Broadway Marketplace
Don’t underestimate this little grocery store by Harvard Art Museums. They’ve got all the essentials: produce, baking supplies, and other healthy-looking foods. Broadway Marketplace is small, so don’t come here shopping for a party (no parties allowed now anyway #thanksrona), but this neighborhood store is perfect for personal grocery needs.
Whole Foods
Yes it’s on the pricey end, but we don’t mind spending a little extra on the good and healthy from time to time. Especially if you’ve got allergies or dietary restrictions, Whole Foods is the place for you. And hot tip: with an Amazon Prime student discount, you can get your groceries delivered to your door and save a few dollars every time you visit in person (thank you, Bezos).
Star Market 
For the quadlings and the people who don’t mind a walk to Porter, Star Market is a fully fledged grocery store that has all the essentials. It’s right by a Target and a shopping center too, to give you some suburb vibes and remind you a bit more of home. Note: they also have a bakery section where you can get cake!
HMART
Just one stop away in Central, this Asian grocery store has got you covered when it comes to produce, essentials, and (most importantly) snacks. With a wide range of imported foods, you’ll be able to find items that aren’t available at any other location on this list. And bonus: There’s a Paris Baguette (the restaurant, not the bread) inside!
No shade (okay, a little shade) to our beloved Harvard Square CVS, but with all these grocery options, there’s no reason to regularly shop there. So next time you're debating if you should drop ten dollars on a carton of juice, pull up this list and just thank us later!
