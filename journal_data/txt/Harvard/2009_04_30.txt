After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here is what J. Robert Oppenheimer (Simon J. Williams ’09) says when he hears the death toll at Hiroshima: “Some numbers are so big, multiplying by two doesn’t make a difference.” 
That line gets right at the heart of ‘The Space Between,’ a new play at the Loeb Mainstage, conceived and directed by Catherine “Calla” Videt ’08. This incredibly ambitious production is the first student-written play to appear on the Mainstage in 15 years. While Videt’s subject might be theoretical physics, what she’s really interested in are moments where the science is inadequate to explain its own implications; equations may have built the bomb, but they can’t handle the fallout.
Drawing on history, mythology, and a dizzying array of artistic work—everything from Beckett to The Books and Bruno Schulz—Videt has constructed a deep meditation on the bridges people build to one another. It’s a big topic; in the first act, one character teaches a class called “Widely Applied Physics.” When you go to see this show—which you definitely need to do—think of it as Widely Applied Theater.
The central character is Richard Feynman (Jesse W. Barron ’09), a physicist who played a supporting role in the Manhattan Project. Lured to the Nevada desert by Oppenheimer, Feynman divides his time between his work and his wife, who is dying of tuberculosis. Her real name was Arline Greenbaum, but here it’s Eurydice, and Catrin M. Lloyd-Bollard ’08 is appropriately enigmatic and cipher-like in the semi-mythological role.
The show develops out of this central relationship in many directions at once, which makes its grace all the more surprising. Feynman’s memories of Eurydice are brought movingly to life by Matt I. Bohrer ’10, who plays the physicist’s younger self. As Oppenheimer & Co. come closer to perfecting the “destroyer of worlds,” the biblical Adam (David F. “Ricky” Kuperman ’11) and Eve (Sarah T. Christian ’11) arrive to reflect on the Earth’s beginnings. There is also a trapeze. 
With an evocative, surreal set by Grace C. Laubacher ’09 and an incredibly complex program of sounds by Josh R. Stein ’09, the show flows and breathes like nothing else I’ve seen at Harvard. It’s sort of a technical miracle, actually. I was told the cast rehearsed six hours a day to make this kind of seamlessness possible. Who knows if that’s fact or exaggeration? It was worth the effort, in any case.
It can be hard to tell where one story ends and another begins, but that’s the point. Videt has a kind of wide-eyed sensibility that sees the world harmonizing with itself at every turn, and the intuitive logic that grounds her thinking is what makes “The Space Between” go. Early on in the first act, two characters discuss quarks, elementary particles born without mass; just like Adam and Eve, one says, “born without sin.” 
Oddly enough, the two characters having the conversation are also named Adam (Rory N. Kulz ’08) and Eve (Julia L. Renaud ’09), both students under the tutelage of the older Feynman. They meet in class, they fall in love, they have a baby. Adam, a painter who hasn’t figured out how to grow up, makes a joke about naming the kid Cain. Theirs is the show’s most affecting relationship.
Working in the vague zones where reality, fantasy, and myth overlap, Videt sometimes has trouble writing real people, but with Kulz and Renaud the emotions are tangible and down-to-earth. Things get cheesy sometimes—“This is what it means to love an artist!” is one of Eve’s less successful lines—but Videt is usually better at bodies than words. There is a moment, during an argument, when Renaud throws herself back on a bed before slowly curling in on herself. The gesture, which mixes irritation, helplessness, and deep fatigue, rings true. We’ve all been there.
Of course, the show also spends a lot of time going to places we haven’t been. In the second act, Feynman follows his departed Eurydice to the underworld, where the loudspeaker that greets him turns out to be very funny: “Welcome to Hell! Where the local time is . . . irrelevant.” Tied to nothing but Videt’s own imagination, Feynman’s performance of the Orpheus myth doesn’t work so well—it’s the one time the word “pretentious” skidded across my brain. 
It’s not until Oppenheimer and history return to view that Hell makes sense, with a line slyly borrowed and modified from Bertolt Brecht’s “Life of Galileo”: “August 6, 1945: Heaven abolished.”The show doesn’t so much end as dissolve, which is meant as praise. Too often artists use History to de-fang the past—think “Schindler’s List”—but Videt finds resonance in events which remain indeterminate, unknown, and unredeemed. The closing sequence is a magical, literally incandescent experience. 
It’s appropriate that the show should open on pre-frosh weekend. With its sincerity and intellectual openness, the show reminded me of those late night dorm conversations that everyone goes through freshman year, when the world seems on the verge of giving up all its secrets. Unlike a stoned freshman, however, Calla Videt knows what she’s talking about. She has real ideas about how people and history work together, and while they’re sometimes fuzzy, they can’t be easily dismissed; I’ve decided to see “The Space Between” again.

With an added risqué make-out session here and a beer pong tournament there, “The Quad” may, at first, seem like a Harvard version of “High School Musical.”  But “The Quad” is a much more substantive production than a bunch of young adults breaking out in song in the middle of their day; it is a rock musical that realistically and thoroughly portrays the current of emotions from those college years and beyond.An original rock musical written and composed by Zoe S. N. Sarnak ’09 and directed by Jordan A. Reddout ’10, “The Quad” explores the tumults of the college experience against a background of upbeat rock music and piano music. Although it is made by college students, performed by college students, and presented to a college audience, the play explores a series of universal themes: conformity, infidelity, loss and renewal of respect, inability to express emotions, loneliness, death, and love.The two-act play opens with the entire company singing “Starting Today”; it is in this atmosphere of new beginnings that the audience is initially introduced to the characters. The music is cheerful and catchy throughout the play, but the lightheartedness is much more prevalent in the first act, capturing the novelty and the delirium of new experiences that dominate that first year of college.The actors, as college students themselves, possess a natural ease with which they play their, at first, stereotypical roles. There is the timid Tenley, her outspoken and party-hopping roommate Parker, the prideful Claire, her clingy sidekick Reese, nerdy and lanky Paul, self-absorbed Liam, preppy Charles, and perky Maitre d’. But these labels do not predict or dictate the plot of the story.With the start of the second act, the complexity of the characters becomes much more apparent, as the characters’ stories unravel and their initially typified personalities acquire layers. Complicated relationships are formed, both romantic and platonic, emotions and personal problems go unsaid, and tensions arise.Certain songs repeat, in order to illustrate the cyclical nature of various situations and the parallels that are made between the characters, adding further depth to “The Quad.” Though the melody and lyrics are the same, songs like “Exactly What I Wasn’t Looking For” develop the plot of the play by placing these pieces in different contexts. The juxtaposition of such different characters and the parallels made between their situations is effective in creating a microcosm of the college experience.The set is comprised of three partitions; stage right contains a marble stone bench and a streetlight, the center is strung up with holiday lights framing a long table strewn with red Solo cups and near-empty rum bottles, and stage left depicts a dorm room with a bunk bed and a cluttered wooden desk.While condensing the college scene into these basic settings, the partitioning also represents the integration of the characters’ very different lives into one continuous narrative. In front of these raised, partitioned sets, the stage is used as a unifying setting in which all the characters come together. The front stage serves as both an extension of the characters’ individual stories and a forum in which to integrate them all.This musical, however, is less of a chronicling of college students’ escapades and drama than it is an exploration of human emotions and the raw struggle that all individuals face. Though it contains scenes bordering on the cliché, the acting, humor, and storyline are not contrived, but they are both entertaining and provocative.“The Quad” neatly packages a four-year experience into a 2-hour performance. Just as the play began with the fresh optimism of that first year of college, it ends with the relief of a happy, hopeful ending after the continuum of conflicts in the second act. “The Quad” faithfully traces the lives of college students in these formative years, avoiding brash exaggeration that would make the characters merely unrealistic caricatures. The production is easy to view, easy to follow, and easy to digest, but is simultaneously deep enough for the audience to reflect, not only on their own college years, but present lives as well.

In the Old South, cotton from the fields and performances on steamboats were staples of everyday existence. ‘Show Boat’—the Boston Conservatory Theatre’s newest musical production—recreates and interrogates what is now a distant world by soldering spectacle with keen social commentary. This successful adaptation of the beloved classic musical brims with exceptional talent on which it relies to carry the production. ‘Show Boat’—which opened on April 24—chronicles one family’s journey on, appropriately, a traveling showboat in the South. Captain Andy Hawks (Trent Mills) directs the traveling troupe while his petulant wife, Parthy Ann (Shannon Martinous), keeps his compulsion and whims in check. Their 18-year-old daughter, Magnolia (Elizabeth Ann Berg), falls in love with Gaylord Ravenal (Adam Fenton Goddu), a handsome but incurable gambler who joins their troupe after misfortune strikes the company’s two leads. As the showboat continues to travel, Magnolia and Gaylord gain prominence as the two new stars and they eventually wed. After the couple leaves the boat, Gaylord’s gambling addiction thrusts them onto a see-saw of affluence and poverty; in the end, the play follows the twists and turns of their lives, bending like the curves of the river to which they ultimately return.In addition to the show engagement with the universal themes of love, sacrifice and struggle, it also casts light on the problem of racism. It highlights the malice of racial prejudices by portraying Julie La Verne (Lori Tishfield), the company’s original lead and Magnolia’s best friend, as a martyr who rescues Magnolia while both face terrible adversities. As director F. Wade Russo writes in his Director’s Note, the show opened on Broadway in 1927 and raised controversy in its “indictment on race relations at the time.” Russo, in effect, tends to direct much of the show’s energy on the hard odiousness of racism.What is most arresting about the Conservatory’s show, however, is its spectacular musical talent. Berg and Tishfield give especially stellar performances. As Joe, a dockworker on the boat, Nicholas Christopher, Jr. delivers a stunningly noteworthy performance of the musical’s leitmotif, “Ol’ Man River.” His surprisingly crisp and sonorous baritone (surprising because Christopher is of a slight build) wholly conveys the soulful resignation of the song’s pith.The pit orchestra also impresses, notably flaunting the student talent of the Boston Conservatory. Without missing a beat, the music infuses the performance with richness and vim, as the orchestra propels the production forward. The overture, for example, begins the show with the pit’s own “solo,” allowing smooth, instrumental sounds to set the atmosphere of the Old South.Nevertheless, some elements, including Anna B. Labykina’s set design, do disappoint. For a musical fundamentally concerned with theatricality, the physical elements of the set fail to convincingly convey the boat’s pageantry. Besides the necessities—a cane here, a bundle of cotton there—the props and set design lack the grandeur of the Old South. The actors, however, make do with the paucity of props and meager space of the cramped stage. Through their vivacious singing and dance routines, the performers ultimately create the illusion that the set does not. In its conjuration of the spectacle of the Old South and its incorporation of the onerous and horrid messes of reality, the Boston Conservatory Theater’s latest adaptation of Show Boat is a production that refreshes itself and asserts its modern-day relevance. As director Russo writes, “More than 80 years after its opening and with a fresh set of eyes, Show Boat still has something to say. It is a feast for the ear, for the eye, for the mind and for the heart.”

Minnesota Governor Tim J. Pawlenty cancelled plans to give a speech at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday evening after learning of his state’s first probable case of swine flu.He was scheduled to give a presentation titled “The Need to Transform America’s Education, Health Care, and Energy Systems,” but instead chose to remain in his home state to respond to the development.“This is a situation that can become more serious,” he said in a press conference yesterday. “It is a sign for concern. It is not a sign for panic.”Minnesota’s Department of Health has labeled the case “probable” because lab testing has confirmed the virus to be type A influenza—a category which includes the swine flu—though it will take one or two more days before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can identify the specific strain of virus.Pawlenty only identified the patient as a woman affiliated with schools in Cold Spring, in central Minnesota. In response to her probable swine flu, Rocori Middle School and St. Boniface School in Cold Spring were voluntarily closed today.Health Commissioner Sanne Magnan, also present at the press conference yesterday, said the woman is recovering and did not have to be hospitalized. According to Magnan, health officials “believe the person had contact with someone who traveled to Mexico.”In Mexico, the country of origin for the current spread of swine flu, 160 people have died of complications from the disease. The first U.S. death from the outbreak occurred in Texas on Monday night when an infant from Mexico City travelling to the U.S. with family died.In response to the spread of the virus, the World Health Organization declared a Phase 5 outbreak, the second-highest on its threat scale.At Harvard, Provost Steven E. Hyman and the Director of Harvard University Health Services David S. Rosenthal ’59 sent out a community advisory yesterday, informing students via e-mail that there were two confirmed cases of swine flu in Lowell, Mass.In the e-mail they urged anyone experiencing flu-like symptoms to seek immediate medical attention and listed resources for Harvard students to learn more about the disease and its spread.

Author T.J. Stiles spoke about his new book, “The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,” yesterday evening at the First Parish in Cambridge.Along with co-sponsors like the Harvard Book Store, the Lowell Institute, and the Massachusetts Cultural Council, the Cambridge Forum hosted Stiles as part of their weekly forums on “cost.”“We are looking at the idea of cost, and obviously the financial world is important in cost. Vanderbilt is one of the architects of the American economy today,” said Patricia Suhrcke, the director of the Cambridge Forum.The Cambridge Forum—which has been operating for 42 years—reaches listeners nationwide each week through radio broadcasts on NPR stations.Stiles, the author of Vanderbilt’s biography, is a teacher of nonfiction creative writing at Columbia University and the author of “Jesse James: The Last Rebel of the Civil War,” a New York Times Notable Book of the Year.Stiles said he chose Vanderbilt as the subject of his book because Vanderbilt’s “is an important life but it is important because it is woven into so many other things than just business.”“It was woven into the course of American events,” he said. Cornelius Vanderbilt was a prominent American businessman and the original “robber baron.” He dominated the U.S. economy in the 19th century with his shipping and railway companies, and according to Stiles, was one of the wealthiest men in American history with an estimated net worth in 1877 of $100 million, representing 1 out of every 20 dollars that was in circulation.Stiles said that though many recognize Vanderbilt for his business endeavors, the businessman’s personal life and ego are the focal point of the story. “For a man who was overly ruthless and willing to gamble the stability of the economy, he had a strict code of ethics and he lived by it,” Stiles said. “That personal pride drove him all the way through and made him such a ferocious competitor.”  From his saving of the economy during the panic of 1869 to his aiding of the Union Navy at President Lincoln’s request, Stiles explained that Vanderbilt led an exciting life but one for his personal benefit. According to the author, “his life played out in an ever going stage against suppressive opponents.” Stiles said he believes that Vanderbilt is an ideal entrepreneur and that an intense research of his personal life reveals a fulfillment of the American dream, a real rags to riches story. “That personal side is something I really tried to intertwine into the story so we could try to build a portrait of this individual filling out the American landscape,” he said.

Jewish student groups Alpha Epsilon Pi, Harvard Hillel, Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, and Harvard Students for Israel hosted a number of events yesterday to recognize the 61st anniversary of Israel’s independence.There was a barbeque at the MAC Quad, a “Cheap Eats for Grads” event at Hillel, and a film screening of the Israeli film “The Troupe”—all intended, organizers said, to bring people together and celebrate Israel Independence Day.  For AEPi, a national fraternity committed to charity work, the barbeque event was both a celebration and a fundraiser for the Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, said AEPi Internal Social Chair Daniel Nachajon ’11. After going on a birthright—a fully-funded 10-day trip to Israel for young adult Jews—Nachajon said he was inspired to fundraise for the hospital, which he said offered care to all comers regardless of political affiliation—a rarity in a country often torn by political disagreements.Yesterday’s barbeque was funded by a grant from MASA, an Israeli program that helps students find jobs, internships, and study abroad opportunities in Israel, said AEPi member Fabian A. Poliak ’11.“Israel is an important place for Jewish people,” said AEPi President Samuel M. Gross ’10, explaining why he valued the celebration of Israeli Independence Day. “It’s great for people who go for so long without land to finally have their land.”Jason W. Schnier ’11, the chair of Harvard College Progressive Jewish Alliance, said that yesterday’s events were not political, but rather that they represented simply a “celebration of culture and of Jewish statehood.”Likewise, attendee Michael M. Kohen ’09 said that he believed Israel Independence Day was about appreciating how much the country has progressed.“Israel is a beautiful place in what its been able to give in 61 years,” said Kohen. “It’s amazing how a country so small can launch satellites in space and be on the forefront of technology.”Matthew R. Cohen ’11, co-president of Harvard Students for Israel, said he hoped that holding the event on the MAC quad could attract non-Jews to stop by and experience a little bit of the Israeli culture.One non-Jewish attendee, Cecelia A. Raker ’11, said she was there with friends but that she thought it was wonderful to see so many people come together.“[Israel] really is incredible in all senses and is still strong,” Raker said.

With fears of the unchecked spread of swine flu sweeping the nation, a recent study from the Harvard School of Public Health may give some insight into tackling the number one cause of preventable death in the U.S.—smoking.Majid Ezzati, an associate professor at the School of Public Health and one of the primary authors of the study—which concluded that smoking causes more premature deaths than other risk factors like high blood pressure or being overweight—said he was surprised by the “magnitude” of the problem. “Smoking effects account for about 1 in 5 deaths in Americans who are over 30 years of age,” he said. Ezzati attributed potential solutions to the problem just as much to policy-making as to individual actions.“Individuals don’t just randomly smoke or stop smoking. They do it because things happen around them, and those things could be higher prices, higher taxes.” Ezzati said. “There could be less access to tobacco because it is regulated...The public health system’s role is to create the trigger for individual action.”Though Ezzati emphasized the need for changes at the macro level—like regulating access to tobacco, advertising, or information on packaging—one student smoker said there is a social aspect to smoking that might not be affected by such changes.“Along with the actual chemical addiction of nicotine, there’s also a psychological and social addiction,” said the student, who said she wished to remain anonymous so she wouldn’t be identified as a smoker. “No matter how much you deny it, there is something comforting about smoking, whether it is the physical act of going out and smoking or commiserating with your friends.”But Christopher T. Chen ’10, the co-chair of the Institute of Politics tobacco control policy group, said that policy change could still be an important deterrent to smoking.“Anyone would tell you that smoking in particular is very much predicated on the legitimacy of it within a social setting,” Chen said. “So, creating systems that suggest or otherwise discourage smoking or decrease its legitimacy is absolutely essential.”

A new mailing list system that offers faster mail service and an improved interface is debuting this week as the Harvard Computer Society migrates lists from the old system onto the new one.The new mailing list system, part of a broader package of new services called “HCS-NextGen,” eliminates delays in receiving mail sent over the 4,595 mailing lists hosted by HCS, according to Joshua A. Kroll ’09, a former HCS president.Funded by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Information Technology and the Undergraduate Council, “HCS-NextGen” includes the mailing list service, an updated web hosting service for students and clubs, and more services that, according to former HCS president Grant W. Dasher ’09, will be announced in the coming weeks.Dasher said that the impetus behind “HCS-NextGen” was a combination of antiquated technology, mailing list slowdowns, and limited storage space.“We had capacity problems in our existing systems. We were running out of storage space for our mail archives. We were having slowdowns that were happening on high traffic days like prefrosh weekend and whatnot,” said Dasher. “Our current systems are about three years old, so we decided it was about time to upgrade our systems.”Kroll said that mailing list subscribers will no longer notice delays when posting or receiving messages. Furthermore, the interface through which users can manage their mailing list subscriptions—an open-source program called Mailman—will be more intuitive and visually appealing.As for list administrators, the ability to customize options such as posting access has been made easier, according to Kroll.Kroll said that migration began early Tuesday. Dasher said that mailing lists were prioritized based on user traffic, with more active lists such as house lists migrated before others. All house lists have been migrated.Along with changes in mailing lists, “HCS-NextGen” modernizes the ability for users to take advantage of HCS’ web hosting capabilities. According to Kroll, the new service enables more dynamic web applications, which increases functionality for site administrators.Kroll said there was one disturbance due to the migration process Tuesday night where e-mail was being delayed for about three hours. Dasher said that despite minor kinks, things are going according to plan.“There’s always glitches,” said Dasher. “Generally speaking, it’s going smoothly.”

Global health experts addressed the potentially devastating implications of global hunger and encouraged students to raise local awareness at a symposium held in the Science Center yesterday evening.Participants in the four-person discussion, entitled “The Ingredients of Food Security,” included Howard A. Zucker, the former assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, along with colleagues in economics, political science, and humanitarian outreach.Zucker began the event by asking attendees to consider the amount of food that goes to waste during an average restaurant dinner. “Now just imagine if one out of every six of us here in the room didn’t have enough to eat, but could not access any of that leftover food,” he said. “Well, that really is the world today.”After citing several causes of worldwide hunger, including famine, poverty, and natural disaster, Zucker offered his thoughts on how to address the situation.  “Dream big, invest significantly, apply technological know-how and political will,” he said.Anita McGahan, professor of management at the University of Toronto, presented the difficulties of achieving proper levels of sustenance worldwide to the half-filled Science Center auditorium. Citing age distribution projections, McGahan said that the global hunger situation would likely be exacerbated in the future as resources are diverted towards growing masses of wealthy elderly and away from impoverished regions elsewhere. Richard Leach, senior advisor for public policy at the Friends of the World Food Program, a United Nations humanitarian organization that combats hunger, praised the students in the audience for demonstrating their interest in global health.Leach commended the strides the United States has made in assisting impoverished nations, but warned that “progress is being threatened” by a lack of communication in Congress.Robert Paarlberg, a political science professor at Wellesley and an associate at Harvard’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, drew a distinction between the emergency aid that the United States effectively distributes on a periodic basis versus the sustained assistance that Africa needs.“Even when international food crises are low, we can’t lose sight of the underlying problem of persistent hunger,” he said.When asked about ways to tackle the issue of global hunger on a local level, Zucker said, “Individuals need to be the voice. Speak loudly.”

The Massachusetts House approved a plan to raise the sales tax from 5 to 6.25 percent on Monday night, a hike that officials said represents a trade off between preventing cuts in services and hurting the local economy.
The sales tax increase—proposed by House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo—will raise an additional $900 million annually in revenue, helping to bridge Massachusetts’ projected $3.6 billion deficit for fiscal year 2010. 
Under the plan, $200 million of the new revenue would go to towns and communities for local aid, and $275 million would go to transportation. The sales tax hike stands in contrast to the House’s initial state budget, released on April 15, which did not draw from new sources of revenue or state reserves and included wide cuts to local aid, services, and programs.
Despite benefiting ailing towns,  Square businesses expressed concern over the tax’s impacts on business. 
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the sales tax increase was “painful” and “difficult” for consumers who are already hard hit by the economic downturn. But she added that the negative impacts of the sales tax would probably be minimal for Harvard Square stores, since shoppers would probably view the tax as a “necessary evil” for relieving the state’s financial difficulties.
Several business owners expressed greater concern. At Crate & Barrel on Mass. Ave., assistant manager Radhika Ramdev said that the tax increase would hurt the store, which stocks big-ticket items like furniture and appliances. According to Ramdev, Crate & Barrel has already been struggling in the difficult economic climate and has experienced a slump in sales over the last six months.
“As it is, people are already hesitant to make their larger purchases,” said Ramdev. “The tax increase will make them think even harder before they even make their final decisions.”
Carole Horne, general manager of Harvard Book Store, said that the increased sales tax further tips the playing field in favor of Internet retailers. 
“It’s unfair that online retailers don’t have to collect sales tax,” said Horne. “To raise the sales tax without exploring that option first just seems crazy to me.”
Though Horne said that she doubted that consumers would drive to New Hampshire just to avoid paying the sales tax, the tax would still have a negative impact on the store. 
City Councillor Sam Seidel said that lawmakers should ideally be able to both protect businesses and to provide funds to towns, but that the current economic climate necessitated a trade off between the two.
But Seidel said that the nature of the customer base of Harvard Square ensured that local businesses would “probably not be terribly impacted.”
“Harvard Square is not just a place to buy goods, but also a shopping experience,” said Seidel. 
Seidel said that he believed the negative impact of the tax would be smaller than the positive impact of the additional local aid that will be available to local communities from the new revenue. 
Before the sales tax, Cambridge was projected to lose $8.7 million in state aid for fiscal year 2010, a loss Seidel said would probably have forced the city to make layoffs and cuts to services to balance the budget.
In approving the tax hike by a 108-51 vote, House lawmakers defied objections by Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 to first consider ethics, pension and transportation reform bills. 
The decision represents the first time in 35 years that the sales tax has been raised.

President Barack Obama announced the appointment of Harvard Professor Daniel P. Schrag to serve on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), in a speech at the National Academy of Sciences earlier this week.
PCAST—which draws its 20-person membership from the private sector and academic community—is charged with advising the President on policy decisions where an understanding of science, technology, research, and innovation are instrumental.
It primarily focuses on issues related to energy, climate change, and healthcare.
Since PCAST was first established in 1990, the majority of advisors have come from industry. 
In a break with tradition, the majority of Obama’s appointees have an academic background.
“After [Obama’s] speech it was clear that this president is committed to embracing scientific advice and truly values what science has to offer to informing his agenda,” Schrag said. “We live in a time of huge challenges and navigating through these decisions...we need good information.”
Schrag, whose areas of expertise include climate change and energy issues, is currently a professor of geology in the department of earth and planetary sciences and the director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment. 
Noel M. Holbrook ’82, a professor of forestry who serves with Schrag on the Center for the Environment steering committee, said his ability to bring different facets of the University together in his work on the environment would serve him well in Washington.  
“I think that the fact that he is able to think beyond science and understand the complexity of the issues and learn from other fields are what you need in a person that will be a sounding board for the president,” Holbrook said. 
Schrag will join Harvard affiliates John P. Holdren and Eric Lander, who were appointed co-chairs of the council in December along with Harold Varmus.
Holdren is the former director of the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program at the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Lander is the director of the Broad Institute—a joint venture between MIT and Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students who rely on recreational facilities at the Malkin Athletic Center during the summer should expect long wait times for machines, older equipment, fewer classes, and overcrowding.According to athletic department officials who spoke to The Crimson on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, the MAC will remain closed during the summer, leaving students with two smaller, less centrally-located facilities: Hemenway Gymnasium near the Law School and the Murr Center, situated across the Charles River by the athletic fields.As part of the University’s sweeping cost-cutting measures, the initiative aims to slash expenses in the athletic department’s budget. But athletic administrators said the move would also cut back on the services that are usually provided by the MAC during the summer—such as an Olympic-sized pool and a host of specialty classes like salsa dancing.In Hemenway and the Murr Center, “there’s no pool, there are way older machines as far as cardio equipment goes, and equipment will probably break faster,” one athletic official said.While some administrators said they were “99.99 percent certain” the MAC would close its doors to Harvard affiliates from June to August, others stressed that no final decision has been made.“I don’t think it’s an appropriate time to deal with hypotheticals,” associate athletic director Jeremy L. Gibson said. “We’re exploring a number of different ways to address the financial situation.”Athletic officials noted that the MAC—“the University’s primary recreation facility,” according to its Web site—is a “popular” facility for Harvard students who stay in Cambridge during June, July, and August.“Given how many students are on campus during the summer, they should really keep the MAC open,” said Jennifer J. Lee ’10, who said she frequented the MAC weekly last summer and had planned to again this summer.“I wish there were a way that we could petition the University, but that’s obviously not possible,” she added.Since most MAC employees are undergraduates—the majority of whom live off campus during the summer—athletic officials said they do not anticipate firing student workers. Instead, they said they will significantly reduce the number of temporary workers hired for the summer.Athletic administrators alluded to this year’s disorderly and drawn out process to finalize the department’s budget. Though budgets are typically submitted early in the spring, the athletic department—like the academic departments within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and undergraduate Houses—is still without a fiscal plan for next year.One administrator added that several budgets have been submitted to University Hall, but as of yesterday, all have been rejected.“We want to best serve our members,” said Wendy Healy, area manager of the MAC and Hemenway, adding that when the administration wants to publicly disclose a final decision, “we will get the word out.”—Staff writer Ahmed N.

Five Crimson athletes spoke at a panel last night to discuss queerness and athletics at Harvard in front of an audience of about 30 people in Sever Hall.
Harvard College Women’s Center intern Kameron A. Collins ’09 hosted the seminar after coming up with the idea for his senior project. 
“I thought it was really important to start talking about gay athletes at Harvard,” Collins said. “It is more liberal [here] in some ways and I wanted to see if that would also be true in the locker room.” 
The athletes—four of whom self-identified as queer, with the fifth calling himself a “queer ally”—responded to questions about the difficulty of coming out on a sports team, the social choices queer athletes face both on and off the field, and the quest for tolerance in a realm that is stereotypically unwelcoming.
The panelists, who cannot be named for reasons of confidentiality, shared a wide range of  personal stories from the experience of dating teammates to what shower time is like when you are gay and on a team.
“I definitely had awkward locker room experiences where girls thought that I was checking them out,” one female panelist said.
After a series of scripted questions from the host, the audience members were invited to address the panel. 
One concern expressed by an audience member had to do with how the Harvard Athletic Administration could contribute to increased tolerance on campus. Cross-country and track captain Kelsey B. LeBuffe ’10, who said she didn’t mind being identified, suggested that simply by co-sponsoring an event like this in the future, the administration would be making a positive statement about homosexuality and Crimson athletics.
“It’s interesting because, at least in the gay community, we always talk about the potential for closeted athletes...so it seems like there would be some good demand for an event like this,” Collins, the event’s sponsor, said. 
“I think that this panel will be one of the most informative experiences that I take away from Harvard,” said one audience member, Adam R. Singerman ’09. “I haven’t had the experience of hearing from queer athletes or straight athletes or any athletes about queerness intersecting with the athletics sphere at Harvard, so in that sense it was completely new information which was fascinating.”
Though the event was the first of its kind at Harvard, Collins said the Women’s Center is excited about the prospect of hosting similar forums in the near future.

By the end of December, most high school seniors never want to see a copy of the Common Application again. But in the basement of the Harvard College Office of Admissions, a framed four-by-two foot copy of the dreaded application hangs on the wall.The enormous application—an actual submission from a hopeful applicant—is complete with the student’s name, high school, and address, with rows of “Harvard” written across the header, with a miniscule “Yale” in the middle.“The biggest kick was that he sent it with a giant paper clip,” says Ian Anderson, the office’s file room director—perhaps the most important cog in the well-oiled machine behind Harvard Admissions. “I think he ended up going to Yale.”The Admissions Office, where 29,112 hopeful students sent their painstakingly crafted essays, letters, and applications to be reviewed this year, is the most exclusive in the country. Behind this machine are 70 people—from Dean William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 to recent alumni to current Harvard students—who together determine the fate of each applicant, with only 7 percent receiving the coveted acceptance letter earlier this month.THROUGH THE MACHINE Once students click “send” on their computers or drop their applications into the mailbox, Anderson’s work begins. Physical and electronic versions of applications arrive in the basement of 86 Brattle Street, where Anderson leads a team of students and staff who organize the piles of paper.The incoming documents—including the applications, secondary school reports, and teacher recommendations—then get scanned, a process that began this year as an electronic back-up system.  “It’s really a security device to make sure we have an electronic record of the applications in case the building burns down,” said Director of Admissions Marilyn McGrath-Lewis ’70-’73.Every morning Anderson prints applications from the Common Application Web site—through which about 94 percent of the applications were submitted this year. In addition to processing thousands of applications, the admissions office also receives gifts and trinkets from nervous applicants trying to differentiate their application from the thousands of others. Anderson pointed to handmade soaps, t-shirts, and a crocheted Harvard insignia on his office bookshelf.  “The soaps made my office smell great,” he says, laughing.“The most fun part about this job is the crazy things people send in,” says Elizabeth Adams ’10, who works in the file room. “I have a Crimson scarf in my room that none of the admissions officers wanted.”All material must first be alphabetized, which is no easy task, according to Adams. “The first couple weeks you’ll come in and say ‘Ian, what should I do’, but after a while you’ll come in ready to alph,” she says.The alphabetized paper then gets made into applicant folders, for which Anderson has another “ingenious” system for organizing the thousands of applications, according to Adams, where each applicant has both a red and a manila folder in their file. The manila folder holds the official application, while the red, or “dummy,” folder, contains the student’s essential information and serves as a place holder when the application is being read.Once the official application and secondary school report arrive, yellow barcode sheets in the folder get scanned. “It’s like working in a grocery store sometimes,” Anderson says. “Scanning tells the system we have the minimum requirement for the folder to be read.”The students who work in the office create thousands of folders nearly each day.“You make one mistake and it ripples through the whole run, so we tend to break it down into a much more manageable 900 or 1,000 at a time,” Anderson says. “Actually, that doesn’t sound manageable,” he adds. THE FILE ROOMOnce an applicant’s folder is made, it joins the nearly 30,000 other folders in the room that makes up the very heart of the admissions office: the file room.The room contains 255 filing drawers, and the walls are completely hidden by the files, except for a small counter—which had to be cut in half last year to make room for still more files—used for alphabetizing and organizing. On top of the cabinets lie more boxes filled with overflow applications.The sheer number of applications processed by the office cannot be fully understood until one is in the file room, according to Anderson. “Every drawer gets so full that you can’t put anything in it,” he explains.  “If you’re trying to file this one item, you have to pull out five folders to get one item in, and then jam all five back in.”After his years of running this essential part of the process, Anderson is familiar with everything that could go wrong—and has a preemptive solution for it.“You don’t want to have too many drawers open at once, because it tips,” he said. “Once it starts tipping, the drawers slide open and then you can’t catch the cabinet...these things weigh a ton.”Anderson’s office, which adjoins the file room, contains the tools he needs to keep track of the thousands of sheets of paper for which he is responsible every year. He has a log book—dating back to the eight years that he has worked in the office—that he carefully fills out every day with a running count of the folders made, and the number sent out to readers, or “cleared.” “See here in July and August,” he says, pointing to his records, “these are the kids who are very anxious and applied before their senior year even started.” Anderson’s job requires balance, organizational skills, and even working through the winter holidays. “We are sometimes clearing 2,000 folders on certain days,” he says. “It’s just about keeping every piece moving, you can’t ignore any of it because then you are in deep trouble.”“I’ve been here long enough that I’ve gotten used to the stress. When you see a lot of things getting done at once, its very fulfilling,” he adds. STUDENTS HELPING STUDENTSAnderson hires about 40 Harvard college students every school year to help in the file room. Students alphabetize, file, and “scrutinize” about once a month, after they have put together many applications.“We sit at a file drawer and look at every single piece of paper to make sure it’s in the right place,” says Adams. “We check to make sure the drawer is in alphabetical order, and in each folder the names are correct. You cannot do it for more than two hours without losing your mind.”Over winter break, Anderson leads a  team of students from the Boston area who work full time to put 14,000 folders together in four weeks. Anderson, who was responsible for more than 40 fellow soldiers when he served in the army before coming to Harvard, says the leadership style demanded by his current responsibilities is comparable but that the people he “commands” here have different expectations.“Here I spend a lot more time explaining why students are doing what they are doing and the steps they must take to remain organized,” he says, comparing them to soldiers who were more ready to simply carry out the tasks he gave them without question.And though the student workers have full access to applicants’ materials, they are trained in non-disclosure laws and Adams says they rarely look twice at any of the information. “You’d think it’s this really glamorous thing where we have all this insight, but when you see the sheer number of materials that we are working with,” she says, “it just turns into paper, almost.”But despite the monotony, Adams says she thinks it’s valuable to have undergraduates filling this role.“I think it’s important to have people who care about future of this school, and understand where students are coming from to work in the admissions office,” she says. DECISION MAKING Once Anderson and his team’s work is complete, the folders are distributed to the admissions officers’ boxes to be read. The office employs about 40 admissions officers, who each are responsible for up to four or five geographic areas, or up to 1,500 folders, McGrath, the director of admissions, explains.  “It’s a process of gathering widely and sort of winnowing as comparisons occur over a ten week process,” she says.The area subcommittee chair advocates for the applicant, “as if he were at a trial and he were the student’s attorney, in a sense,” says Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions. In the more widely-known part of the process, admissions officers create a reader sheet for each application, which rate the student on their academics and extracurriculars.After the subcommittee process, all the readers meet in full committee for about three weeks, and go through every school and every person, “asking again if we are sure this is a person we want to accept on April 1st,” Fitzsimmons says. “As far as we can determine, there is no other college that spends as much time in committee as we do.”Once the full committee votes on each applicant, in a “one person one vote” process, the decisions are made, and the applications return to Anderson in the file room. THE FATE OF THE PAPER Students who are accepted and decide to matriculate have their applications held at the Freshman Dean’s Office where they later form the “nucleus” of what eventually becomes the student’s college record, McGrath says. Once students graduate, the folders go to the University’s archives. Applications from rejected students are kept for three years before they are shredded. Anderson has a sheet of paper posted on his office fridge, listing the application numbers for the past eight years and the percent increase for each year. “It’s fun to look at,” he says. “When I started [working here] we were at 19,000 applicants, and here we are at 29,000.” But once the yearlong process finishes, it starts again immediately.  There is already one lone box containing applications for class of 2014, waiting to be alphabetized and filed.

The Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub hosted Brendan Maclean and the Magic Hat Brewing Company last night as a continuation of its Beer School series.Beer School—which began in the spring of 2007 when the Pub opened—brings in local brewers to host beer tastings and to talk about life in the brewing industry. Beer School takes place about two or three times per semester.MacLean, the leader of the series, is the sales representative of Magic Hat Brewing Company in the greater Boston area.  During his presentation, he spoke about Magic Hat’s most successful beers, the process of brewing, and the history of Magic Hat.Magic Hat, or the “Willy Wonka of Breweries” as described by Maclean, was founded in 1994 in Burlington, Vt. For the company, Maclean said that Beer School presents an opportunity to spread the taste of the new beers to college students and to have a fun time while doing it.“It’s a great way to get to our target audience,” he said.  “And I get to interact with people and spread the good word about beer.”Students in attendance enjoyed the experience. “To a certain extent, we try to be beer connoisseurs,” said Thomas E. Southworth ’10, one of several student managers of the pub. He added that the event was intended to attract both new and old customers. While most of the faces in Beer School were familiar to the staff of Queen’s Head, this session was a first-time experience for many students, but  not their last.  Alyssa H. Devlin ’11 and Anna R. Schulz ’09 said that they thoroughly enjoyed their first experience at Beer School. “I found out on my house list, and wanted to try it,” Schultz said. While most students at the session showed an inclination towards Magic Hat’s “#9,” Maclean said that he did not necessarily agree.  “I guess I should say Magic Hat,” he said.  “But it definitely depends on the situation. I can’t say I have one favorite beer.”

The Harvard School of Dental Medicine will be closed today after a sample collected from a student there was deemed a "probable" case of swine flu late yesterday.According to Director of University Health Services David S. Rosenthal ’59, state health officials are still waiting for final results from Atlanta, where the sample, originally taken on Monday, was sent to be tested at the Centers for Disease Control—currently the only facility in the country that has the capacity to issue final confirmation on swine flu."All I know is they have a positive culture for H1 and they sent it down to the Centers for Disease Control," Rosenthal said. "H," or hemagglutinin, is the protein marker that distinguishes the subtype of flu of which swine flu is a variety. Further testing is necessary for final confirmation of a swine flu diagnosis.Final results from the CDC are expected today, according to Rosenthal. If confirmed, this will be the first swine flu case registered in Boston.
The student, who was started on anti-viral medication when flu was first diagnosed early this week, was at home and doing well, Rosenthal said last night."We’re in touch with him on a daily basis and he’s being monitored closely, and he’s doing fine," Rosenthal said.The infected student had been in contact with an unidentified—and potentially untested—individual who had recently been to Mexico, said Rosenthal. Boston public health officials have distributed questionnaires to individuals who may have had recent contact with the student in search of other possible carriers of the virus, he said.Over 200 students, faculty, and staff make up the Dental School, located across the river in the Longwood Medical Area, approximately four miles from the University’s main campus. Dental School affiliates are currently being screened by Boston Public Health Commission officials, according to a release from Rosenthal and University Provost Steven E. Hyman.Harvard’s School of Public Health and Medical School, also located in the Longwood Medical Area, have taken precautions to prevent spread of the disease, which is raising health alerts nation-wide—eliminating self-service food stations to cut down on hygiene risks.Rosenthal stressed last night that the best way to defend against transmission of swine flu is by practicing simple hygiene. In an e-mail sent to the Harvard community earlier this week, Rosenthal and Hyman urged students to wash their hands with soap and water, and to cover their mouths when coughing.Thus far, the only two cases of swine flu confirmed in Massachusetts remain those contracted by two boys in Lowell, Mass., who are currently recovering from the illness after a recent trip to Mexico, The Boston Globe reported Wednesday.But an update yesterday on the Web site for Amherst College in central Massachusetts stated that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health had found that two of the school’s flu cases were "probable" instances of swine flu.People who experience symptoms of possible influenza infection—including sudden fever, cough, muscle aches, and sore throat—were urged in a statement issued by the Boston Public Health Commission today to contact their health care providers for additional guidance.—Staff writer Edward-Michael Dussom contributed reporting to this article.—Staff writer Noah S.

Things have a way of coming full circle for Dan Kantrovitz, which is why it’s no surprise that he’s found his way to Harvard.At the moment, Kantrovitz is in the Graduate School finishing up his master’s degree in Statistics. Once he’s done, he’ll relocate to the Bay Area, where a job in the Oakland Athletics’ front office is waiting for him.How Kantrovitz arrived at this point is a tale of coincidence mixed with common sense, and luck—both good and bad—mixed with determination, with baseball always at its center.When the St. Louis native left his job as his hometown Cardinals’ Director of College Scouting to come to school in Cambridge, it wasn’t the first time he had expressed interest in studying at Harvard.Over a decade earlier, Kantrovitz was a star high school shortstop looking for a place to play college ball.“I got some great advice from a high school baseball coach,” he says, “which was to pick your college as if baseball doesn’t exist there.”With this in mind, Kantrovitz looked for a program that could cater to his interests, academic as well as athletic. Harvard appeared to be such a place, and he visited the school hoping to see if it would be a good fit.“I didn’t know much about Kantrovitz,” Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh says. “He came to the office and he was interested. I never saw him play in all my summers going out [recruiting].”Walsh informed Kantrovitz that with established players firmly holding on to most of the infield positions—including Kantrovitz’s natural position of shortstop, occupied by David Forst ’98—Kantrovitz’s playing time would be limited in his freshman year.He chose Brown instead, where he was part of coach Marek Drabinski’s first recruiting class and was immediately given the chance to start.Kantrovitz responded with an impressive career in which he picked up 208 hits—good for seventh all-time in the Ivy League—in four seasons from 1998-2001 and made the All-Ivy First Team twice.“Kantrovitz just went out and hit,” Walsh says. “Left field, center field, right field—he just was a tough out. He was a thorn in our side for a couple of years.”After Kantrovitz graduated from Brown, the Cardinals selected their city’s native son in the 25th round of the Major League draft.Playing professionally was just the next step in what Kantrovitz saw as the natural progression of things.“I was just trying to be the starting shortstop on my high school baseball team and then I was trying to be the starting shortstop at Brown,” he says. “You keep doing that and eventually people start to take notice. I didn’t want to do anything else.”But Kantrovitz would not make it past rookie ball in his pro career, thanks to a shoulder injury he suffered during his last year at Brown. Kantrovitz had minor surgery “as sort of a Band-Aid approach” to get him through his senior season. Once in the minors, he had another operation to try and fix the shoulder permanently, but the pain lingered and, while he could hit, his play in the field was severely hindered.“A 5’8 [designated hitter] in the National League is not going to work a whole lot,” Kantrovitz says. “I saw the writing on the wall at that point.”John Mozeliak, the person who signed Kantrovitz for St. Louis and the big league club’s current General Manager, called Kantrovitz in to his office to inform him that the Cardinals were letting him go.Of course, neither man could have guessed that Mozeliak would wind up hiring Kantrovitz in a different capacity a few years later.After Kantrovitz’s minor league career came to an end, he tried investment banking for a year but, as is his nature, started gravitating back towards baseball. He began working for a startup company that offered baseball analysis tools to Major League teams. One of the teams he pitched his product to was the Cardinals, and following a presentation Kantrovitz gave to the St. Louis brass in 2004, Mozeliak offered him a new career in the game he loves—in the front office rather than on the field.Taking on added responsibility at a steady rate, Kantrovitz excelled as he learned the ins and outs of various aspects of the Cardinals organization, from scouting to international operations to quantitative analysis.The statistical aspect of player evaluation particularly piqued Kantrovitz’s interest, and he decided to pursue a broader base of knowledge in the field.“With the influx of data that’s coming out now, I wanted to keep up with that,” he says.While with the Cardinals, Kantrovitz had forged a relationship with Harvard statistics professor Carl Morris, a former chair of his department who—among his various achievements—has conducted several groundbreaking studies involving the statistical analysis of baseball. To Kantrovitz, studying with Morris at Harvard was the perfect medium through which to take his career to the next level.“He emailed me several years ago,” Morris says. “I’ve done this kind of sports work my whole life but I’ve kind of kept it under wraps. But somehow Dan got wind of it, and thought this would be a good place to study and I would be a good person to study with.”While completing an intensive one-year master’s program, Kantrovitz has applied the general statistical knowledge he’s accumulated to enhance his understanding of baseball. In one class, Kantrovitz has “designed an experiment to maximize the sink on a fastball based on a pitcher’s vertical release point, horizontal release point and velocity, with the hopes of finding the optimal combination for individual pitchers,” he explains in an email.Kantrovitz hopes to bring his findings and experience at Harvard to his new job with the Athletics. He was hired by Oakland earlier this year by the team’s Assistant General Manager—who just happens to be David Forst, the guy who had shortstop held down at Harvard when Kantrovitz looked at the school for the first time.Forst insists that Kantrovitz was good enough to find playing time no matter who was in front of him on the depth chart, while Kantrovitz is equally sure that he would have been hard-pressed to see daylight at shortstop for the Crimson in his freshman year. Of course, the decision would have been Walsh’s to make, and the Harvard coach’s verdict is in line with Kantrovitz’s thought.“Forst was…a much better defensive shortstop at the time,” Walsh says. “He was established here at the time.”“[But Kantrovitz] turned into a good defensive shortstop by his senior year and Forst turned into a very good offensive shortstop by his senior year,” Walsh muses. “It’s funny how their careers paralleled and here they are working together.”Regardless of who would have started, Forst is pleased with his hire, citing Kantrovitz’s Ivy League education, playing and scouting experience, and quantitative skills.“We’ve been looking to add somebody to the front office for almost a year,” Forst says. “Of all the things that you’re looking for as a potential employer, Dan almost covers everything.”Kantrovitz’s job with Oakland will involve a combination of scouting—mostly international—and analytical work in the front office. It is the next step for a person who has already come full circle a time or two, but has yet to veer off his chosen path.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

10-30.13-28.The first set of numbers is the Harvard baseball team’s record from 2008. The second—the Crimson’s record in 2009.Looking at those results, the logical conclusion to make is that Harvard had pretty similar—and pretty bad—seasons in those two years. Numbers don’t lie right?Well no, they don’t. But sometimes they mislead.2008 was a disaster for Harvard. The team was picked by Baseball America to win the Ivy League going into the season, but instead it finished dead last in the Rolfe Division while posting the third-worst record (8-12) in the Ancient Eight overall. Injuries were a factor—then-junior slugger Tom Stack-Babich went down early in the year and the pitching staff took a couple of big blows when it lost then-sophomore Eric Eadington after two starts and highly-touted prospect Greg Malley never made it to the mound at all.Still, with established senior starters Shawn Haviland ’08 and Brad Unger ’08 headlining the rotation, former captain Matt Vance ’08 leading an experienced lineup, and a number of talented freshmen plugging in whatever holes remained, the Crimson should have been able to put together a respectable season, or a mediocre one at the very least.But Harvard seemed to lose its drive somewhere on its Spring Break to California—where it was toasted by some of the top teams in the nation—and let its struggles carry into the Ivy season. Pretty much everybody underperformed, starting at the top: Haviland and Vance each put up the worst numbers of their collegiate careers. Only after the Crimson hit rock bottom, skidding to a 1-7 start in league play a 2-22 record overall, did the team finally appear somewhat motivated, playing .500 ball the rest of the way.A season in which Harvard finished so far from reaching its originally lofty goals has to be considered a failure. At the onset of 2009, expectations for the Crimson were more tempered. Haviland and Unger were gone, leaving sophomore Max Perlman—coming back from a year off—as the closest thing to a sure bet on the pitching staff. The rotation would have to be pieced together with sophomores that had shown flashes of competence but not consistency and rookies that had not shown anything at all. Harvard was returning its fair share of veteran bats, but bringing back most of a lineup that combined to hit .255 the previous season was not exactly cause for unbridled optimism.And yet, while a 13-28 season can hardly be called a success, there was one very important aspect of 2009 that had been missing from 2008: progress.Like last year, the campaign started off with adversity. Perlman injured his elbow in his first start and saw his season erased by Tommy John surgery. The Crimson sputtered out of the gate again—this time in Louisiana—getting knocked around during Spring Break once more by teams that were simply out of its league. Then the team was swept by Columbia in the first doubleheader of the Ivy League season, and it looked like Harvard would be delivering a repeat performance of a show that should have been cancelled after the first act.But this Crimson team would prove different than its predecessor. The next day Harvard swept Penn, and then proceeded to win six of its next eight Ivy League games, displaying a resilience that characterized the squad as much as shaky pitching and defense often did.A testament to the Crimson’s refusal to give up: Harvard outscored its opponents 19-6 in the ninth inning this season and 11-4 in the 10th and beyond. The team played in three games that went to extra innings, and won each time.The Crimson’s inherent aversion to defeat spread from its seniors to the rest of the team. Stack-Babich and Matt Rogers combined for 17 homers in their final seasons, while Taylor Meehan and captain Harry Douglas each hit well above .300 and provided some pop of their own. The powerful senior bats eased the burden on an inexperienced pitching staff, allowing some promising rookies to develop their stuff—in particular starters Brent Suter and Conner Hulse. The two young hurlers had their struggles, but by the end of the season both looked prepared to be rotation mainstays in the future. This is not to say that the Crimson played great baseball this year. Harvard had a penchant for digging its own grave—its defense committed too many untimely errors and its pitching staff threw too many balls outside the strike zone, as well as too far into it. Eventually the team’s bats returned to Earth and its flaws proved too numerous. The Crimson blew any chance it had at the Ivy League title by losing four-straight games to Brown two weekends ago. But Harvard proved its resilient character this past weekend against the Rolfe Division’s best. The Crimson bounced back from Game 1 blowouts to beat Dartmouth in the nightcaps of each doubleheader. The Crimson capped off its season by coming back from a 7-0 deficit to beat Northeastern, 16-13, on Tuesday.13-28 doesn’t exactly cleanse the palette of the bad taste left by 10-30. But there’s no doubt that Harvard is in a better place looking towards the future than it was at the end of last season.Sure, the Crimson will have to take four steps back before it takes any steps forward as it loses its quartet of senior sluggers. But Douglas and Rogers didn’t do much with the bat until this year, which leaves room for hope that a new batch of heavy hitters will emerge.Harvard’s rotation should have a whole new look next season. Suter has ace potential and Hulse is a workhorse. If Perlman and Eadington come back as expected, the Crimson might boast the best crop of starters in the Ivy League.But the most important adjustment from this season that Harvard needs to carry over to 2010 is its change in attitude—a development that can be attributed to Douglas’ leadership. Whoever the next captain is would be wise to follow the current one’s example and keep his team fighting no matter the circumstances.As concrete as numbers seem to be, they still leave room for interpretation. The seeds Harvard planted this season tell a story beyond the team’s record, and if they blossom next year, 13-28 will have a better connotation than one might expect.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ups and downs of yesterday’s season-ending 3-2 loss to Boston University (36-15) at the BU Softball Field perfectly mirrored the highs and lows the Harvard softball team has experienced throughout the season.The Crimson (27-17, 11-9 Ivy League) started off its 2009 campaign on a strong note with tournament wins at the Miken Classic and Highlander Classic, but in the end, suffered tough home sweeps to Yale and Dartmouth that derailed its quest for a third consecutive Ivy North title.  In a similar trajectory, Harvard scored first yesterday but relinquished its lead in the bottom of the third. And while the Crimson looked to rally in the later innings—it narrowed the Terriers’ lead in the fifth and was primed to regain the lead in the sixth—things just didn’t fall Harvard’s way as the team came up just short in its effort to close out its season with a win. “It was a good game,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said.  “We hit the ball really well but we hit it right at people.  We didn’t have any errors and they didn’t have any errors.  They got the key hits when they needed them.”“I thought we came out really relaxed and really loose,” freshman Whitney Shaw added.  “We came out on pace with BU.  It was a very complete and well-played game and it was overall a great effort.”Freshman Rachel Brown started and finished on the mound for the Crimson.  While the rookie allowed three runs on six hits, she also had eight strikeouts to improve her own all-time Harvard record to 211 K’s in a single season.“I love pitching for this team,” Brown said.  “I certainly didn’t expect to get this much time my freshman year so I appreciate the opportunity to help out this team any way I could.”Co-captain Hayley Bock anchored the Crimson’s offensive efforts against its cross-town rivals in her last appearance in a Harvard uniform with a home run and two scores.  “[Bock] had a great game today,” Shaw said.  “She had this intensity that she came out with—she just wanted to leave it all out on the field.  Overall, she’s just been a force.  She always leads by example and she has such a presence at bat and behind the plate.”Bock got the action going at the top of the second by blasting the day’s only homer—the fourth of her season and 11th of her career—to right-center to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.  BU overtook Harvard on the scoreboard in the bottom of the third with two scores of its own.  With runners on first and second, the Terriers’ Melissa Dubay pounded a triple to right field that landed just inside the foul line.  The Crimson avoided further trouble with two consecutive outs at third and second. But, BU furthered its lead in the next inning when Rachel Hebert singled to score teammate Emily Roesch, who had advanced to third on a passed ball.  With two outs already, catcher Bock threw to Vertovez at short, catching Hebert trying to steal and ending the frame.Harvard was able to close the gap in the fifth.  Once again, it was Bock that sparked the Crimson offense with a single up the middle.  She was able to advance to second on a sacrifice bunt by freshman Jane Alexander before rookie Mari Zumbro scored Bock with a double to right center to make the score 3-2.  “This team fights,” Vertovez said. “We didn’t want to lose our last game out there and we were going to try as hard as we could.  Even those last innings with two outs, we wanted to win that last game.”Harvard looked to carry its offensive momentum into the sixth as sophomore Ellen Macadam and Shaw led off with consecutive singles.  With Macadam on third and after junior Margaux Black, who pinch ran for Shaw, stole second, the Crimson looked to be in the perfect position to take the lead as Bock came up to bat.Unfortunately for Harvard, Terriers third-baseman Brooke Hudson snagged Bock’s line drive to end the inning and effectively, the Crimson’s season.“If [the hit] had been a foot taller or a foot lower—basically anywhere besides in the girl’s glove—we would have gotten runs,” Shaw said.  “We were hitting the ball hard today; things just didn’t happen to fall our way but that’s just the way the game goes.”Despite the bad bounces and the unlucky hits, Harvard ultimately ended its 2009 campaign with a winning record. While there were tough times—particularly this weekend’s home sweep by Dartmouth—the Crimson’s ability to rebound and correct its mistakes indicate that this season will likely go down as one of positive rebuilding for Harvard.“I’ve loved every second of [this season] and I’ve had a great year,” Vertovez said.  “We started off really strong but we had our ups and downs as any season will. It’s tough to lose the way that we did in the last game and we all would have liked to go further.”—Staff writer Lucy D. Chen can be reached at lucychen@fas.harvard.edu.

In sports, a lot can happen in the matter of a second. Too many times have fans witnessed games and championships being won and lost—all in that tiny fraction of time.But for freshman lacrosse player Katie Doherty, one second would be more than enough time to score a goal. With just one tick left on the clock in regulation, the sensational rookie scored her 16th goal of the season, lifting the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (6-10, 2-5 Ivy) over host Boston College (9-9) yesterday to a 9-8 victory in Chestnut Hill, Mass.“It was awesome,” sophomore Sam McMahon said. “There’s no better feeling to have done this for our seniors. On their Senior Day, we couldn’t get the win for them, so this was like their second Senior Day.”The victory against the Eagles came just a week after the Crimson upset 20th-ranked Cornell 11-7. That win marked not only Harvard’s first win over a ranked opponent in seven years, but also gave the Crimson a much-needed burst of confidence to finish out the season strong. “We had a rough patch in the middle of the season, so you couldn’t have asked for a better ending,” senior Shannon Flynn said. “We saw what we are capable of doing out on the field [against Cornell], so that really gave us the momentum for today.”And the Crimson wasted no time capitalizing on this newfound confidence, coming out of the gates running with an explosive offensive attack in the first period against its cross-town opponent. Though Brittany Wilton got the Eagles on the scoreboard first with 21:52 to go in the first half, junior tri-captain Sara Flood responded with a tally of her own less than 40 seconds later to even the game at 1-1. “It was all about hustling for the full 30 minutes, defensively and offensively,” McMahon said. “Defensively, it was all about making big stands. [Junior goalie] Katie Martino was playing amazingly. Offensively, it was just putting it away. There’s really no explaining it.”The two teams traded two more sets of goals, and with the score tied at 3 it appeared that neither squad could exploit a weakness in its opponent’s defensive game. But Harvard would embark on a 5-0 run late in the first period, getting impressive solo shots from sophomore Jess Halpern and Flynn.“We knew that they were going to push out on us on defense,” Flynn said. “We tried to stay in section, work with one another, and clear space for each other. I think that allowed those seven goals to come through.” The duo of senior Kaitlin Martin and Flood also got in on the action, with Flood providing assists to Martin each time as she earned the last two tallies of the period.“They definitely do have chemistry,” Flynn said. “Sara’s a really great feeder; she gets a lot of assists because she can really read the defense well. Kaitlin is just a phenomenal scorer, so the combination of that has really helped us in the last two games.”With the offensive spark and a bend-but-not-break defense led by Martino, the Crimson limited the Eagles’ first period damage to just three tallies while scoring seven times, giving it a decisive advantage going into the second period. “[Martino] is feeling really confident, which is really what you need as a goalie because everything is against you,” McMahon said. “She was ready for [the second half].”The match had all the makings of a nail-biting game going down to the wire when BC ignited a comeback effort just minutes after the beginning of the second period. Helping the Eagles was Lauren Fitzpatrick, who scored two goals in as many minutes. With her efforts, the Eagles cut the lead to just 7-5 for Harvard. The Crimson dominated draw controls all afternoon—claiming a 5-2 advantage—but suffered from four second half turnovers. With just 1:33 on the clock, Martin won the draw, but the Eagles regained possession and tied the game 8-8 with just 30 seconds remaining.Enter Katie Doherty. After Harvard won yet another draw control, Flynn tossed the ball to Doherty to set up the game-winning goal. With just one second left on the clock, Doherty fired and scored, preventing the Crimson from blowing a four point, first-half lead. “Winning those draw controls was really the key to the game,” McMahon said. “We also had to maintain possession.” “We didn’t play as well in the second half,” Flynn added. “We let them come back in, had some turnovers on both ends. It was nerve wracking but we were able to finish it off, so that was really good.”Despite a tough season, the Harvard players remain optimistic about the future of their team. The Crimson will look to build off of a strong two-game finish from this season. “We have big expectations for next year,” McMahon said. “Not many people are graduating and we have a big freshman class coming in. It’s going to be a really big season and we want to pick up from where we left off.” —Staff writer Kevin T. Chen can be reached at ktchen@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week the nation’s second-largest athletic program acknowledged that the recession had dealt it a devastating blow. MIT, proud former promoter of 41 varsity sports ranging from the mainstream to the obscure (the Engineers sported one of the best air pistol squads in the country), cut eight of its teams, including alpine skiing, men’s and women’s ice hockey, men’s and women’s gymnastics, golf, pistol, and wrestling. While Harvard can now pat itself on the back for being the only school in the nation with 41 intercollegiate teams, any celebration should be short-lived. The reality of the recession puts the Harvard Athletic Department in a precarious position, faced with the same 10 to 15 percent budget reduction as the rest of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. There is no doubt that balancing so many sports poses a difficult task, and if the Crimson faces anywhere near the $495,000 setback that the Engineers will suffer in 2009, Harvard Athletic Director Bob Scalise may have little choice in wielding the axe on a few less prominent squads. If he does so, it will be a tremendous loss for the Harvard community. High profile sports like basketball and football will never be at risk—not as long as they draw fans—but some of the Crimson’s most competitive squads often seem to be some of the school’s best kept secrets. My first beat as a fledgling sports reporter last spring was wrestling, a vacancy left for a freshman because it had escaped the interest of even my fellow sports fanatics. I had never seen a wrestling match (my high school didn’t have a team), and thus pored through the NCAA rulebook for help, too afraid to ask the athletes about the basics (junior co-captain Louis Caputo may be a gentle soul, but a meeting in person makes it painfully obvious that he could kill you with his bare hands). While I was forced to bluff my way through early articles (it takes awhile to understand how one grappler can score points when both fall to the mat in a mutual headlock), one thing did not escape my notice. From the moment that I took my seat in the MAC bleachers, it was clear from some of the pummelings delivered on the mat that this team had talent. Top-notch talent. Then-sophomore J.P. O’Connor finished sixth in the country that year, marking Harvard’s third straight season with an All-American competitor. The squad only improved this season, with sophomore Corey Jantzen and Caputo joining him among the country’s elite. All three wrestlers hovered in the top 10 for their weight class all season en route to the NCAA championships, with Caputo taking All-American honors for an eighth place finish. Can you think of any other teams at Harvard with three players ranked in the top 10 at their position? Squash? Fencing? Maybe women’s hockey? A theme starts to emerge pretty quickly: Some of our smallest sports also represent our most nationally competitive talent and while disbanding any of them may not impact overall attendance, it would gravely diminish the quality of our athletics. Of course, our traditionally stellar squads will not be threatened regardless of economic conditions, as it is hard to imagine that Ancient Eight institutions like crew or squash could find themselves without a home in Cambridge anytime soon. But how could we devalue those less heralded sports that continue to improve each year? Women’s golf claimed its second Ivy League title in as many seasons this past weekend, while the women’s sailing team recently qualified for the ICSA National Championship—a feat it did not accomplish in 2008. And even wrestling, which could not keep pace with No. 2 Cornell or Penn in the Ivy League, will return all three of its all-stars in 2010 to give the Big Red a run for its money. Yet, just down the river the Engineers will not compete in two of these three sports next year. This detail is not intended to belittle MIT—Athletic Director Julie Soriero made the decisions that she had to make when faced with a constrained budget, and the Engineers will undoubtedly adjust to the loss. But for a Division I school like Harvard—and particularly in this community, which prides itself on fostering a wide array of talents—eliminating a sport of any size is a travesty.We can fully acknowledge the difficult decisions that lie ahead, not just for Harvard’s athletic department but also for this entire institution. But for the Crimson, cutting nationally-ranked teams or those still finding their footing does a disservice to the mission of DHA. As we await the announcement of the 2009-10 budget, let’s hope that such drastic measures are a last resort. —Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

Not necessarily the first three words that come to FlyBy's mind when describing Harvard (Trail of Tears maybe?....we jest).  But we suppose if you're a prefrosh coming up on one of the finest weekends both weather and party-wise, it's easy to get fooled.
The Crimson's Roving Reporter was out and about during prefrosh weekend, chatting it up with a few of the prospectives.  The verdict: Harvard guys beat expectations (and the girls are friendly?), some of you hosts really suck, the bowling team may have its first groupie, and Delphic, your reputation precedes you.
Also, 1:25-1:27 is kind of priceless.  Smart play, prefrosh, but we know you four-strawed that scorpion bowl.  Watch it all, after the jump.

The newly branded HUTV (Harvard Undergrad TV) challenged students to create a video that answers the question "What's Harvard Really Like?" Four videos have been posted from what was originally a larger field, according to Derek Flanzraich, the organization's co-president. To vote on the best video go here. Voting closes tomorrow at midnight. The winner will receive free food from b.good for a month.
The four video submissions, after the jump:
What's Harvard Really Like?

Chris Liberge '12, of On Harvard Time fame, stars in the first video along with his roommates. There are several things that we can learn about Harvard from this video:
Like a Boss - daharvardremix

It is fair to say that this video has the worst production values (particularly lip synching) of any video—ever. What it lacks in quality, it fails to make up for with substance.

A widely-circulated e-mail from an MIT engineering student suggesting that one of her peers had contracted swine flu contained false information, an MIT infectious disease specialist confirmed this afternoon.
"My good friend's roommate was diagnosed with swine flu yesterday and they're basically in quarantine to prevent the spread of it," stated the e-mail, which reached the open lists for eight of Harvard College's 12 Houses in the space of just five hours this afternoon. "They go to MIT but live off campus  in Boston so that means there are definite cases going around the area," the e-mail continued.
But there have been no confirmed cases of swine flu among the MIT student population, said Howard Heller, the chief of Internal Medicine at MIT, in an interview this afternoon.  According to Heller, as of yesterday MIT has seen one confirmed case of Influenza A--a general species of the flu virus whose many variants include the standard "human flu" as well as the "H1N1 virus" known as swine flu--but it was unlikely that the person diagnosed had contracted swine flu.
"The person was not at a high risk for H1N1 as far as travel risk or exposure risk, and the specimen was sent to the lab," Heller said.  "They're the ones that do the confirmation and we've not heard anything back from them."
According to Heller, Influenza A cases can be diagnosed in a matter of hours at University medical centers using a "rapid flu" test, but any further diagnosis had to come from the laboratory at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.  The results of the state test could be days in coming, Heller said, but the case in question did not raise any red flags.
"It's normal to see cases of Influenza A throughout the year," he said. "The thing that would alarm us if we started to see a lot of influenza A occurring in a cluster, or if we saw influenza A occurring in a group of people with additional risk factors."
Contacted for comment by The Crimson this afternoon, the MIT senior who sent the original e-mail this morning wrote in an e-mail that she had no further comment on the matter and that "nothing is confirmed."
More on the message, the flu, and other swine-related things, after the jump.
The mistake was eventually corrected at a later point in the MIT e-mail chain by a first-year MIT student, who wrote at 12:14 p.m, 10 minutes after the original message had made its first appearance on a Harvard house list, that "the girl is at MGH being tested for swine flu.  So far, it is only known that she has the flu.  When [redacted] sent this email this morning, she didn't know that. Don't freak out, just keep washing your hands and stuff like that."
Thus far, the only two cases of swine flu confirmed in Massachusetts remain those contracted by two boys in Lowell, Mass. who are currently recovering from the illness after a recent trip to Mexico, The Boston Globe reported yesterday.
But that hasn't kept the disease from taking it's toll on the MIT medical center, which has seen increased traffic from people thinking they might have the disease.
"We're really backed up here because of the whole flu thing," said Monique Lewis, a secretary at MIT Medical.
When asked whether the uptick was because more flu cases were appearing, Lewis responded, "No, people thinking they have it."
