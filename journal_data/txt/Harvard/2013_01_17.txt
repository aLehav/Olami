After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a historic 2012 campaign, the Harvard men's volleyball team will open its season this weekend with two road games in the tri-state area. The Crimson squad will face the Stevens Institute of Technology (1-1) on Friday evening before taking on New York University on Saturday afternoon.
Harvard, which finished second in the EIVA behind Penn State with a 10-4 conference mark and 18-6 overall record, achieved its first national ranking last year and returns most of the major players from last season. The Crimson was picked to finish fourth in the conference in a preseason poll.
Harvard has not faced either opponent since the 2011 season. The Crimson swept Stevens, 3-0, in their last meeting but fell to NYU in five sets, 3-2. The Ducks, which compete at the DIII level, were voted to finish first in their conference, the UVC. The Violets, also members of the UVC, were chosen to finish third. Both teams are ranked in the top 15 nationally for DIII programs.
Stevens, which went 28-8 overall and a perfect 12-0 in the UVC, reached the conference finals last year, falling to Nazareth College.
The Ducks are led by a trio of outside hitters, senior Thomas Hannum, junior co-captain David Evans and junior Ryan Seifert. The group respectively had 344, 340 and 310 kills over the 2012 season. Seifert and Hannum register just under three kills per set while Evans notches 3.27 kills per set. This year, Seifert has already drilled 23 kills and Hannum has hit 21.
“They're outstanding players,” Stevens coach Patrick Dorywalski said. “Many of them could have played Division 1 but they chose Stevens because of the academics so that's a great thing for us. They're really well-skilled, talented players.”
Sophomore setter Kevin Aeckerle leads the team in assists, accumulating 989 last season and 41 thus far this year. Aeckerle and Hannum also set the defensive effort for the team. Both have 10 digs this season.
Senior middle hitter Jake Modestow is the primary blocker for the team. He tallied 173 blocks last season, the second-most in program history, and has eight this season.
The Ducks have played two games this season, dropping the first against the University of Waterloo, 3-0, while prevailing on the road against the University of Puerto Rico, 3-2.
“We only lost one of seven starters,” Dorywalski said. “I think it's going to be a great match. For a home opener, it's going to be quite a big match to start with but I think we're in good shape.”
NYU, which will open its season against Harvard, also cruised to an undefeated 11-0 UVC season last year and went 20-9 overall.
The Violets will return one of their three top hitters. Junior Nick Capriccio had the third-highest number of kills, with 257 and an average of 2.4 per set. The middle blocker also held team-highs in service aces, with 41 over the season, and blocks, tallying 69.
Veteran setter Connor Mortland dished out 876 assists last season for an average of 10.68 and will be a threat at the net.
“They're going to be pretty tough,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “We played them in the preseason this year and we beat them pretty handily but they were missing some key players who were all studying abroad so we have a pretty confident scouting report on them. I definitely want another shot after freshman year, so I'm excited.”
Last season, the Crimson was led in kills by outside hitter Matt Jones '12. Jones, who registered 345 kills and 3.83 per set, currently starts for Volley Bartreng, a professional team in Luxembourg. The graduate holds the all-time program record in kills, service aces, and digs.
This year, sophomore DJ White and Madden will return to lead the team in kills. Madden, an opposite hitter, was second on the team in kills last year, with 268 and an average of 3.01 per set, while White, an outside hitter, followed him with 248 and an average of 2.76 per set.
“I know that Matt Jones was a vicious part of our team last year and you can't replace him,” Madden said. “I think that we'll be just as strong as we were last year from the outside.”
Co-captain Rob Lothman will serve a final season as the primary setter. Lothman handed out 889 assists last season for an average of 10.10 per set
The team will also get a boost from its three rookies. Brandon Clemens and Alec Schlossman, both outside hitters, will jostle to start at their respective positions. Alister Bent will provide depth in the defense, backing up junior Chris Gibbons as libero. Gibbons had a team-high 211 digs last season, with an average of 2.45 per set.
“All three of them have improved a ton since the beginning of the season,” Madden said. “I'm really excited to see how they do this season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Different week. Different teams. Same result.
Despite a jam-packed schedule with two weekend conference games followed by a Tuesday night showdown against Connecticut, the No. 2/3 Harvard women’s hockey team did just what it’s been doing all season long. It made winning look easy.
The Crimson blanked both Princeton and Quinnipiac last weekend, then followed it up with a 5-1 routing of Connecticut three nights later.
“We’re really happy with how we’re playing,” co-captain Laura Bellamy said. “We’re 5-0 in January, and it’s been nice to be on campus and just think about hockey. We’ve been happy with the way we’ve played [since the break].”
With a 14-1-1 season record, the Crimson has seemingly faced little opposition from its competition so far this season, winning by an average of 4.64 goals.
The Crimson has a chance to keep its perfect 11-0 ECAC record intact when conference foes Rensselaer (6-14-2, 4-6-0 ECAC) and Union (7-12-3, 0-7-3 ECAC) travel to Bright Hockey Center for a pair of weekend matchups.
“They’re both tough teams,” Bellamy said. “[They’re] really hard working.”
First up for Harvard will be a rematch with RPI. When the two teams faced off two weeks ago, the Engineers gave the Crimson one of its toughest tests of the season. Harvard went up early in the second with a goal by junior forward Kalley Armstrong, but RPI fired back and squared the game up before the close of the period. A power-play goal by senior defender Kelsey Romatoski gave the Crimson the 2-1 lead it would maintain, but not without some close calls down the stretch.
“We could’ve played better the last time when we played RPI,” junior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “We owe them a big game, especially having them come to our rink.”
Freshman forward Mari Mankey tallied RPI’s only score of the night, one of her four goals on the season. Fellow first year Alexa Gruschow leads the team with nine goals and ten assists on the season, good for a team-high 19 points.
“I think the biggest thing is making sure they remember us a little better after this weekend,” Fry said. “We let it be to close last time we played them. We didn’t play Harvard hockey.”
After that, Crimson will have a Saturday showdown against Union. Two weeks ago, Harvard breezed to a 9-0 victory when they travelled to Schenectady, New York to take on the Dutchwomen. It was the Crimson’s most dominating performance of the season, as Harvard saw seven different players score. Harvard outshot their opponent 42 to 13 on the evening.
But even with such a commanding win, the Crimson does not underestimate Saturday night’s opponent.
“Union’s going to throw everything at us,” Bellamy said. “Anytime someone comes to our home rink, we know they’re going to give it all they’ve got.”
The weekend’s home stand will be the last time the Crimson plays at Bright for the rest of the month. Harvard has a pair of road stints lined up the next two weeks, as well as a Beanpot appearance to kick off its February contests.
With the end of the conference schedule in sight, the Crimson looks towards its ultimate goal of the season: a national championship. The only previous national title for the program was back in 1999, when the Crimson won the AWCHA national championship. The AWCHA structure was replaced by the current NCAA tournament in 2001. Since then, Harvard has gone on to appear in the NCAA finals three times, the last of which was in 2005, but has never come home with a victory.
“It’s definitely in the back of our minds to go for a national championship,” Bellamy said. “That’s our main goal. But we know that until then, we just have to take it one game at a time. Coming up here we have some big games against some conference opponents.”
But even as the Crimson amasses more wins and bolsters its national ranking, the team’s ultimate weapon—its mentality—is unchanged.
“The biggest thing is that we keep our humility about us,” Fry said. “We talked about this today, we don’t let what anybody else says, or blogs, or any of that kind of crap get to our heads. This is about us.”
“We’ve promised ourselves our focus will be on our next game,” Bellamy said. “Our biggest game is our next game, and that’s RPI tomorrow.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a little less than a minute remaining in the fourth quarter, Linsanity was alive and well once more Wednesday night. Jeremy Lin ’10 had just scored 12 points in six minutes, bringing his Houston Rockets squad back from a double-digit deficit to within one of the Dallas Mavericks. But as Lin’s next shot from the charity stripe missed off the rim, Houston’s efforts fell short as well, and it ultimately lost, 105-100.
Lin’s onslaught in the final period, which made up a large portion of his team’s 15-4 closing run, totaled 74 percent of his points on the night. For the second straight game the Harvard alum shot just under 50 percent from the field while putting up a negative efficiency rating.
While Houston’s backcourt, consisting of Lin and shooting guard James Harden, had recorded an average of 6.74 turnovers per game prior to Wednesday’s contest, the duo almost doubled that number against Dallas. The two combined for 11 mistakes, something that Lin deemed to be a deciding factor in the contest.
“We were a little too nonchalant with our passes,” Lin said. “We tried to force it a couple of times. I had a key turnover down the stretch that was unnecessary.”
Harden echoed Lin’s sentiments, stressing the unnecessarily high level of difficulty that he believed Houston added to the contest.
“You’ve just got to make the easy play,” Harden explained. “We were trying to do a little too much, one extra dribble too much.”
With the loss, Houston’s fifth straight, the Rockets fall to 20-19 on the season, half of a game ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers for the eighth spot in the Western Conference. While Lin’s squad remains in playoff position at the moment, the tightly packed nature of the West means that it may take as little as three more losses to go from eighth to eleventh seed, from battling in the postseason to fighting for a better pick in the draft lottery. Houston heads to Indiana next, where it’ll take on a 24-16 Pacers team that trails the Miami Heat by only two games for the top spot in the East.
