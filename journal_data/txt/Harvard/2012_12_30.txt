After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Washington lawmakers scramble to reach a last-minute budget deal before the end of the year, Harvard and other research universities are bracing for what would be the most dramatic cut in federal research funding in recent history.
Failure to come up with a compromise to avert the so-called fiscal cliff by midnight Monday will trigger an 8.2 percent across-the-board cut in non-defense discretionary spending. As a result, Harvard will lose out on millions of dollars in promised federal grant money for the 2013 fiscal year.
Because the cuts will be applied to the current fiscal year, which began July 1, the loss in sponsorship will be compounded onto the second half of the fiscal year, worsening the blow for the remainder of the 2013 fiscal calendar.
The University received roughly $656 million in federal sponsorship during the 2012 fiscal year. Though the University has yet to release information for the 2013 fiscal year, sponsorship figures were not expected to change drastically from current levels. Federal sponsorship comprised about 16 percent of the University’s overall operating budget for the fiscal year 2012, according to the Office for Sponsored Programs 2012 annual report.
The schools most at risk from federal cuts are Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health, both of which rely heavily on the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation for funding. The Medical School alone took in over $250 million in federal funds during the 2012 fiscal year, a sum that accounted for 34 percent of its operating budget. Though the School of Public Health brought in a slightly smaller total of nearly $193 million, that amount was 55 percent of the school’s overall budget.
Of all University schools receiving significant federal support, The Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the most diversified, relying heavily on private sponsorship in addition to federal support. FAS received just over $135 million in federal monies for the fiscal year 2012—about 12 percent of its overall budget.
Roughly 75 percent of federal sponsorship to Harvard comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the NIH. But the University also receives funding from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense, which stands to experience cuts at the slightly higher rate of 9.4 percent.
Younger faculty who rely on upstart research money for their first projects are particularly vulnerable to federal funding cuts, but all University researchers receiving federal sponsorship will be forced to tighten their belts.
University President Drew G. Faust has already warned Congress twice about the dangers of cutting funds for research. This summer, she and more than 100 other university presidents wrote to Congress and the President, urging them to avoid the automatic cuts. “Sequestration is an undiscerning and blunt budget tool that would substantially harm our nation’s future by blindly slashing valuable investments in education and scientific research,” the letter read.
In November, Faust and 15 other leaders of Universities and other research institutions signed a letter sent to the entire Massachusetts congressional delegation, calling on the legislature to avoid cuts to funding that schools “depend on to deliver innovations essential to economic growth.”
Faust told The Crimson in early November that in the long term, the University could make up for federal funding shortfalls through new sources of revenue, including partnerships between researchers and industry or philanthropic support for research. The University already receives millions in private research funds, but those numbers will likely grow as long term cuts are made at the federal level.
According to University administrators, threats to federal funding are not a new concern. Robert D. Reischauer ’63, senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—said that the Corporation’s budget meetings have discussed preparing for slower growth or reductions in research funding for some time.
“The flashing red lights have been flashing now for a few years,” he said in early December.
The recent set of fiscal cliff measures was written into the Budget Control Act of 2011 in order to force Congress to address mounting budget deficits before the end of the year. The law calls for the sequestration, or automatic trimming, of discretionary and non-discretionary federal spending to the tune of $100 billion. Cuts will take effect on Jan. 2 and increase progressively in coming years. Additionally, Bush-era tax cuts and other more recent breaks will immediately expire.
Any deal that is reached before the fiscal cliff deadline—now less than 48 hours away—is expected to address only taxes, not spending, though Congress has expressed optimism it will reach a broader compromise after the deadline passes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BERKELEY, Calif.—Entering its non-conference matchup against favored Cal, the Harvard men’s basketball team was averaging 15.6 three-point attempts per game this season. But Saturday night, Harvard topped that number in the first half alone.
The Crimson (7-4) recorded 17 attempts from deep in the opening frame on the way to a 10-for-27 effort overall and a 67-62 victory.
“I’m surprised that we took as many [threes] as we did, but we had them. They were shots that were open,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I am disappointed that we didn’t shoot it better.”
Cal attempted just six long-range shots on the game, all of which missed their mark, as the Crimson outscored the Bears, 30-0, from beyond the arc.
And although the Bears (8-4) claimed a one-possession advantage toward the end of the second half, the Crimson held on to upset its California opponent at Haas Pavilion.
Of the 33 points Harvard scored in the first frame, 18 came from deep, with co-captains Laurent Rivard and Christian Webster leading the way with two threes apiece in the first frame.
“Our whole game plan…was try to stop the shooting,” Cal guard Allen Crabbe said. “But obviously we couldn’t contain them, so we didn’t do a good job at that.”
Although each Harvard player that attempted a three knocked down at least one, the Crimson dipped below its season average of 40 percent, hitting 37 percent of its shots from long range.
Rivard led Harvard in scoring with 19 points, knocking down five of his 12 attempts from the field—all from three-point range—and shooting 4 for 4 from the foul line down the stretch.
INSIDE SCOOP
While the Crimson was quick to capitalize on its three-point shooting, Cal’s inside presence dominated at the start of the game.
With 9:45 to play in the first half, sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi scored Harvard’s first points inside the arc, finishing a layup off of a bounce pass from Webster. Until that moment, all of Harvard’s close-range attempts had been denied, as Cal blocked four Crimson layups in the opening 7:05.
The Bears’ forward Richard Solomon turned away five Harvard shots on the night—including four of his team’s initial five—as Cal tied the school record of 11 blocks in a single game.
Although the undersized Crimson lineup only amassed two blocks of its own, Harvard outrebounded Cal, 19-14, in the first half and finished the game with 33 to the Bears’ 34 boards. Cal entered Saturday night’s contest outrebounding its competition by an average margin of 7.6 boards on 40.8 rebounds per game.
“Statistically, [Harvard is] one of the poorer teams in the paint because they aren’t very big,” Cal coach Mike Montgomery said. “But we couldn’t take advantage of that, and that was really tough on us.”
Sophomore Jonah Travis—who finished the game with seven points on three-of-eight shooting—led the way down low, collecting a game-high eight rebounds, four of which came on offense.
ROLE PLAY
Although sophomore wing Wesley Saunders leads the Crimson in scoring with 15.8 points per game, he stayed off the scoreboard until 4:58 to play in the opening frame and added just five points in the first half of Saturday’s contest.
But according to Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, Saunders’ focus heading into Saturday’s matchup was on the defensive end, where he was matched up with Crabbe, the Pac-12’s leading scorer.
“We told him it might not be a game where he was going to be a big scorer for us,” Amaker said. “His assignment was to be on Crabbe…. We told him we weren’t going to be concerned with the offensive production, but we needed to see the defensive efficiency and concentration on that end, and I thought he set the tone for us there.”
Despite the slow start, Saunders found his offensive stride in the second half, leading his team with 13 points in the frame to finish the game with 18—the second highest Crimson total. Crabbe ended the contest with a game-high 27 points, including 17 in the second half.
“I was pleased with [the team’s] effort defensively,” Amaker said. “We had some breakdowns, but that’s to be expected against a good offensive team like Cal.”
“Our plan was to try to make them take tough, contested shots,” freshman point guard Siyani Chambers added. “I think, over the course of the game, we were able to do that.”
Harvard’s second leading scorer, Chambers, was quiet from the field for the duration of the game. But although the rookie point guard shot just 2 of 15 including one of seven from three-point range, the freshman found other ways to contribute.
“Siyani’s penetration and his ability to find people was sensational,” Amaker said.
Chambers tallied a season- and game-high nine assists and two clutch free throws to increase Harvard’s slim lead to three points, 65-62, with 17 seconds remaining in the game. Two more free throws from Rivard pushed Harvard’s total to 67, where it stayed as the clock winded down.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Houston Rockets’ night could be summed up in a single statistic: only one player on the team’s entire roster had a positive efficiency rating in Saturday’s contest against the Oklahoma City Thunder. As a result, Houston and Jeremy Lin ’10 were blown out by the Thunder, 124-94.
The game, which came on the second night of a back-to-back, remained close well into the second quarter. After three consecutive points from Lin, the Rockets were within two of Oklahoma City, 52-50, with four minutes remaining in the half. And then it all went wrong for Houston.
The Thunder scored 16 straight points to close the period—11 of which were put in by MVP-candidate Kevin Durant—and went to the visitor's locker room with a comfortable 18-point lead. The Rockets were unable to decrease the gap in the third and fourth quarters, finishing the game shooting less than 40 percent from the field and 75 percent from the charity stripe.
“It’s just a matter of being consistent throughout the 48 minutes,” Lin said in his postgame interview. “Against great teams we can’t have [those] lapses…Tonight was just a tough one. Just one of those nights.”
Lin and backcourt-mate James Harden both struggled against the athleticism of the Thunders’s guards, and had almost as many turnovers, eight, as they did field goals, nine. Lin did tally a team-high seven assists, his fourth time achieving at least that many dimes in Houston’s last five games.
The Rockets will have one more chance to end 2012 on a positive note when they take on the Atlanta Hawks, a team currently on a four-game win streak, at home on New Year’s Eve.
