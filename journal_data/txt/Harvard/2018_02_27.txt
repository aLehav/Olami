At the Boston Sketch Company, traveling turtle salesmen, tea-kettle-obsessed murderers, and the end of the world all came to life. On Feb. 17, the Boston Sketch Company brought their stand-up comedy show to Cambridge’s ImprovBoston theater. Composed of comedians Kenny Gray, Laura Rose, Mike Lovett, Samantha Merriweather and Sumeet Sarin, the group of five opened the show with a cringe-inducing Youtube introduction relying heavily on low-hanging, unoriginal references, and timeworn celebrity jokes in order to garner quick laughs from the audience. The show had a few good moments, but they were ultimately overshadowed by the humorlessness of many of the group’s other sketches.
Despite this overly meme-esque introduction, the group quickly proved their mettle as they began to perform some sketches. Self-deprecating humor and audience participation quickly created a relaxed and intimate environment, bolstered by the audience’s proximity to the stage. For example, in one particularly zany sketch, an audience member had to quickly move her foot out of the way to avoid getting lettuce thrown at her.
Some sketches were clearly innovative and somewhat profound. One such sketch, which featured a conversation between a therapist and a man who has anxiety, drew humor from relatable situations about everyday stress and concerns. Another particularly amusing sketch featured a family of two farmers: A seven-year-old boy and his mother conversed about the death of the boy’s pet bird. As the two came to realize that yet another family pet died, they began to discuss life and death using Einstein’s theory of relativity to inform their discussion of the perished farm animal. The sketches about the mundane landed well due to both their originality and relatability. Such sketches were able to somewhat redeem show.
Particularly uninspiring, however, were the sketches that relied heavily on melodrama, shock, and unoriginal content. Dramatic lighting and audio were overused at points and diverted attention from the substance of the sketch. One sketch depicted an engaged couple who realized the bride would become Mrs. Helen Keller if she were to take her husband’s name. After initial shock, the two asked themselves, “How could we not have seen this? How could we not have heard this?” before coming to a wholly unexpected, illuminating epiphany: “This is what it was like for her!” If one endeavors to take the clichéd, offensive, juvenile route that is the Helen Keller joke, one must at least make it truly engrossing or impressive, and Boston Sketch Company’s attempt at doing just that largely missed the mark. Other sketches were heavily prop-reliant, and drew focus away from the joke itself and instead placed attention on eye-catching yet unnecessary props—heads of lettuce, large stuffed animals—to invoke humor.
The most notable of the group was Rose, whose versatility as a performer allowed her to come up with humorous content on the spot during improvisational scenes. She also wholly immersed herself in her roles during planned sketches and dominated the stage with her talent. Additionally strong actors included Kenny Gray and Mike Lovett, whose solid rapport was clearly visible as the duo’s antics contributed to some of the more humorous aspects of the show.
The Boston Sketch Company’s show had a lot of promise, but many of the group’s sketches left much to be desired and were especially weak when compared to the group’s funnier pieces. At its worst, the sketches were cheesy unoriginal pieces overly dependent on cheap gags. Though some sketches were truly promising, the Boston Sketch Company should turn its attention to creating more complex, inventive sketches in order to rise to its fullest potential.

Jason James’ film “Entanglement”’s enticing title and plot set-up blunders and misses the target. Its whimsical effects are beautiful on their own, but don’t particularly help the film with its struggling narrative. The film’s so-called “entanglement” suggests magical moments and wonder, but it falls short of any surprises, becoming more and more predictable with each passing scene.
When Ben Layten (an endearing Thomas Middleditch), a divorcé, loses himself after a suicide attempt, he tries to make sense of where his life went wrong by making a timeline web of red yarn and pictures of his life on the wall. Soon after, his parents reveal to Ben that he was supposed to have an adopted sister before they found out his mom was pregnant with him. In pursuit of his almost-sister Hanna Weathers (a spunky and fearless Jess Weixler), Ben sets off on what he calls his own “quest.”
Next door, Ben’s neighbor Tabby Song (Diana Bang) is everything that he’s not. Skeptical yet caring, Tabby seems to play the actual role of the sister, caring and protective in nature. Some of the best shots of the film come from the peephole perspective of Tabby’s room, revealing her behind-the-door thoughts about Ben. Bang’s performance makes Tabby’s character convincing, but her actions, along with a few tense moments throughout the film, make it obvious early on that Tabby’s concern for Ben goes beyond those of a friend.
When Ben finds Hanna, he realizes that he has already met her before. Convinced that his own life has fallen to the current state as a result of quantum physics (of which he only has an amateur understanding at best), Ben finds an echo chamber in Hanna’s claim that she’s connected to Ben through “quantum entanglement.” That, coupled with Ben’s deteriorating mental health (he continuously hears voices and sees an alternate self in the mirror, animated deer in the park where they play hide-and-go-seek, and glowing jellyfish in the pool they break into) give away what Hanna really is.
Nonetheless, the animated jellyfish scene is fantastic and charming. The translucent pink shapes contrast with the blues of the water and the illuminated figures of Ben and Hanna’s bodies wading underwater, bubbles rising from their faces to the light shining down from above. An earlier cut features Ben and Hanna in the same blue-tinted shot, dancing at a concert with lights flashing behind them. Paired with evocative music, these scenes stand alone as the highlights of the film.
“Entanglement” touches on a little of everything, but doesn’t do any of it particularly well. Both Hanna and Ben’s pathetic attempts to explain complex physics concepts and metaphors suggest a somewhat academic endeavor (perhaps reminiscent of “A Beautiful Mind”). An underwater scene of Hanna telling Ben to “just let go” as she floats down into oblivion screams a cheesy rendition of Rose telling Jack that she will “never let go” in the iconic “Titanic” scene.
The ending, predictable from halfway through the film, leaves an unsatisfactory exposition of what the title and first few minutes had left expectations for. “Entanglement” gets tangled in its own plot, unnecessarily complicating details of a predictable story.

Founded in 2005, Reddit is a massive internet online forum in which hundreds of thousands of topics are discussed, home to some of the funniest, craziest, most random, deplorable, and unique content on the Internet. In 2017, it was the fourth most visited website in the United States and the eighth most visited website in the world. In his new podcast “Endless Thread,” host Ben Brock Johnson of WBUR, Boston’s NPR news station, dives into the vast expanse that is Reddit and picks out some of its hidden gems. With producer Amory Sivertson, Johnson tells the public some of the entertaining stories that inhabit random corners deep within the bowels of Reddit. The stories chosen by this duo are wildly unique, surprising, and often touch upon issues deeper than one might initially think. They are lenses through which one can learn about the lives of others and discover new perspectives.
“Endless Thread” is unique in concept. In today’s age of social media addiction, the podcast is able to seamlessly connect with its listeners, the vast majority of whom have at least some degree of familiarity with Reddit or similar platforms. By taking something seemingly mundane, like Reddit, a site which visitors use on a daily basis without a second thought, and pulling from its most obscure yet exciting pages, “Endless Thread” is addictingly captivating and has the potential to quickly build an avid fan base.
The Feb. 8 episode of “Endless Thread” entitled “Three Stories Of Love, On Reddit”, Johnson and Sivertson tell three love stories. The first “story of love” revolves around a married couple who met on Reddit. Both passionate fans of wrestling, they met through postings on the “Squared Circle” Reddit page, a space for any and all things wrestling-based. The couple discovered they lived in the same town, had a date where they watched wrestling, and the rest was history. The second love story is told from the perspective of a woman who recently lost her mother. Upon sorting through her mother’s things, the woman discovered hundreds of love letters that her mother had written her father when she was 16 while he was studying at Princeton. The story of the letters, which were funny, moving, and at times, TMI, warmed the hearts of many on Reddit and is covered effectively by the podcast as the woman herself appears in the episode for an interview. The final story starts in the “askreddit” subReddit, in which people ask random, occasionally poignant questions to the Reddit world and see what people reply. In this story, the question “What happened to your first love?” was posted, and a Reddit user replied with a story he witnessed between two high school students.

“See the color of what you’re saying,” Jill Scott’s voice rang sweet and low as she leaned over the piano. “You have to see it and sing it, or it’s not real to anybody but you.”
On the piano stool sat Arlesia G. McGowan ’19, listening intently to Scott’s feedback on her performance of “Unenduring,” an original song. The opportunity to perform for such an accomplished artist is rare—Scott is a celebrated cultural icon and a recipient of three Grammy Awards. McGowan was the first performer at the Feb. 20 masterclass with Scott and Esperanza Spalding, music Professor and three-time Grammy winner, who together formed the kickoff to this year’s Black Arts Festival. This iteration of the festival, produced annually by the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, centered around the idea of coming of age—“a retrospective on the experiences that shape Black collective and individual identity,” according to Kuumba.
After opening remarks from Kuumba President Marcus K. Granderson ’18 and Black Arts Festival Co-Chair Olutoyin Demuren ’18, the musical portion of the event began with an a capella rendition of Scott’s 2004 hit “Golden” performed by eight members of Kuumba. Performer Mirielle E. Wright ’21 said, “It was a lot of stress to plan and rehearse for, but to have her here and to see my friends go up there and share, it was an amazing experience.”
A masterclass followed the event. Typically, a masterclass consists of a pupil delivering a performance and an expert in the craft at hand giving feedback. Scott is undeniably an expert when it comes to vocal performance, and the structure was very similar to a traditional masterclass—however, it felt more like a conversation between friends than an instructive session. Scott sat in the first row of the audience, and after each performance ended, her musical voice rang out through the lecture hall as the audience snapped, hollered, and cheered along with the music and commentary. Occasionally, she would stand and move to interface more directly with the performer.
The first performance was McGowan’s, and Scott received it with joy. Praising the political and emotional potency of the McGowan’s lyrics and tone, she urged the singer and pianist to relax her tempo, to slow it down, and to “let your face speak” as the lyrics hit home for the audience.
Next, Roderick Mullen ’19 performed a cover of “This Woman’s Work” by Kate Bush and “Latch” by Disclosure featuring Sam Smith, accompanied on guitar by Alexander S. Graff ’17. Scott immediately commended Mullen’s mastery through multiple registers. Standing up, she said, “Walk like you’re giving a gift […] Strut in something you like, walk with authority, and look people in the eye.”
Third came Eden H. Girma ’18, singing an original composition, “Untitled,” accompanied by Graff. Scott appeared profoundly moved by Girma’s performance, offering little advice for musical improvement. “You don’t need to sing anybody else’s songs anymore […] I would pay to see you,” Scott said. Girma then performed another original piece, and the only guidance that Scott offered centered on how to process fame.
Finally, Michael A. Wingate ’18 covered Moses Sumney’s “Plastic.” Scott gushed over Wingate’s voice, remarking, “When you started it felt like somebody putting a hot water bottle in your sheets.” Above all, she emphasized the importance of vulnerability onstage, and of allowing the audience to feel your pain.
This formed a consistent thread throughout the evening, and nowhere was it more evident than in the conversation that concluded the night: a discussion on artistic roots and staying grounded with Esperanza Spalding. Scott shared stories of her musical inspiration, of the complex women who allowed her to grow up in a world of love and art and honesty. She spoke of the importance of staying grounded and being able to say no to opportunities, and she gave words to the emotional experience of performing.
“You can taste it: joy, pain. This is the human experience,” Scott said. “And this is what we do— we share the human experience. This is the work. And I think you can do it.”

The state of Hip Hop has evolved in a way few of its originators could have anticipated. On Feb. 13, the Hasty Pudding hosted four New England-based DJs: DJ Chubby Chub, DJ Pup Dawg, DJ/producer Papadon, and DJ Tone Terra. The panelists shed light on how they’ve adapted to hip hop’s changing landscape, emphasizing the importance of how both a passion for music and a mind for business are equally important nowadays to succeed in the industry.
Technology and all it entails provides ever-growing platforms for artists, something the panelists wished they could have taken advantage of when their careers were just starting to burgeon.
“Use your sources. You’re in a day and age right now where you can put stuff up on any platform. You’ve got Soundcloud, and Mixcloud, and Facebook. We didn’t have that when we were starting out,” DJ Tone Terra said, before reminiscing about one of his first gigs at his high school, one of the few places he could initially share his music.
DJ Chubby Chub agreed. “Like what Tone said, the best thing is getting your product out there. Nobody makes CDs or tapes anymore, but put your stuff on a thumb drive,” he said. “Get your logo, put it on a thumb drive. Do 15, 20 minutes, pass it out, let people hear who you are. Tell someone to take a chance on you.”
But the artists emphasized that it’s also important for an artist to not lean solely on the internet as a platform.
“Don’t get stuck behind a computer. You have to go out,” DJ Pup Dawg said. Going out to DJ at gigs, meeting new producers and club owners, and building up an offline fanbase can be just as crucial for an artist’s career to take off, in terms of both building a name for oneself and learning to be a professional. The panelists themselves learned how to network and interact with people who were higher up in the industry to their advantage. Without going out, only to get rejected constantly, they never would have learned the language of the trade, nor met those who would give them the opportunity to rise out of the initial stage of their career.
YN PROP, an artist who puts together music events in the greater Boston area, appreciated the panelists’ insight on the value of networking. “I thought the event was awesome, very informative,” he said. “The panelists gave a lot of information that would be helpful for upcoming DJs and artists, and basically how we can all work together  and network to get to new levels in the city.”
When it comes to getting an edge in the rap and hip hop industry, a relatively young musical genre, DJ Papadon stressed the importance of understanding the history of whatever music an artist is trying to make.
“You want to go back and learn whatever history you can in terms of hip hop or whatever genre you like the most,” DJ Papadon said. Having started out his career using CDs and dual players, Papadon went back to turntables to better his craft and learn more about the music he wanted to create. By learning to make music the way his predecessors had, Papadon became more informed as to what direction to take his own music. “That was the key for me: going back and learning all the things that I know the best are using.”
For DJ Pup Dawg, staying close to his cultural roots was key to both build a fanbase and separate himself from other DJs. He said that when he first started out, the Indian community following was his “core” that came to all his events.
“Even in Boston right now, when I do a spot, I would say 35-40% of [the audience] is South Asians that come out and support me,” DJ Pup Dawg said. “You’re my base and you got me to where I am, and I will never turn my back on them.”
The panelists also made note of how the artists of today have learned to navigate the financial danger of being solely an artist. Decades ago, record labels would ruthlessly take advantage of the clients signed to them. But according to the panelists, artists have now learned from history and have grown business-savvy enough to understand how to get their fair share of the paycheck.
“The music industry is shifting to accommodate those who refuse to be signed to a label. “That’s what the business was at the time,” DJ Pup Dawg said. “It was like nobody knew you were handing [record labels] lots of money, and people were signing their lives away and not realizing they weren’t going to make a single dollar for the rest of their life with these hit records. So now this new wave of artists has definitely learned all about the business.”
Paul E. Krasinski, a Milton resident who works with Spotify and Pandora through his self-started audience measurement company, learned a lot from hearing about how business-oriented artists have become.
“I actually think it’s interesting to see how the entrepreneur/enterprising side of music has started to come up, because I think it was talent, and business, and now those two things are inextricably linked,” he said.
For Caleb A. McDermott, a recent graduate from Boston University Business School, being adaptable was the key takeaway.
“I think understanding adaptation and how, if you want to be convinced that your way is the best way, one day that way will be outdated,” he said, “So understanding that even if you think you know what’s good, times change and culture changes and to be aware of that by reading, by experiencing the culture yourself, you know, those things that they were talking about I think regarding culture and how it adapts and being adaptive with is was interesting.”

Taylor Swift. Katy Perry. Selena Gomez. The all-seeing, all-knowing internet has spoken, and deemed these pop stars problematic. Is there anyone left standing? How will we ever continue our idol worship now?
Enter Jessie J, our new woke queen. We may have been unaware of Jessie J’s shining wokeness when she first warbled her way into the pop scene circa 2010, but a look into her early lyrics reveals that she’s been in conversation with OG woke baes Judith Butler and Gayle Rubin all along.
Take Jessie J’s debut single, “Do It Like a Dude.” In addition to being a hot bop, the song is an incisive statement on the performative nature of gender. According to aforementioned woke queen Judith Butler, we do not have fixed or inherent gender identities. Rather, gender is “performatively constituted by the very ‘expressions’ that are said to be its results”! When Jessie J sings, “I can do it like a brother, do it like a dude / Grab my crotch, wear my hat low like you,” she is demonstrating her ability to perform masculinity, thus destabilizing the false dichotomy between women and men and highlighting the arbitrariness of gender. Jessie J seems to tell us that as gender is constituted through repeated stylized acts, it can be subverted, broken, and transformed simply by adopting an alternative set of repeated acts. Yes, Jessie, slay!
But Jessie J is too much of a woke queen to stop there! “Do It Like a Dude” also offers commentary on the Lacanian psychoanalytic theory that is so essential to woke bae Gayle Rubin’s hallmark essay “The Traffic in Women.” We see Jessie alluding to Lacan and Rubin in the line “My B-I-T-C-H is on my dick, like this.” In Lacanianism, the phallus is not the physical penis, but the set of symbolic functions commonly associated with male genitalia: most prominently, the ability to possess and dominate women. According to Rubin, the only way for the feminist movement to succeed is to “resolve the Oedipal crisis of culture” brought on by the patrilineal inheritance of the phallus. When Jessie J sings about her “dick,” she is calling for a restructuring of phallic inheritance in service of women’s liberation. Does it get more woke than that?
Wow, is Jessie J a socially aware badass or what? Get ready to buy her fourth studio album “R.O.S.E.,” which is dropping this year! Sure, Gayle Rubin would say that capitalism exploits women, but surely there’s an exception for woke queens.

“Jackie Weiss, Mike Hodge wrote, had died of a broken heart, it being broken by several slugs from a .45,” reads a line in “Chicago.” In his new novel, Mamet interweaves Mike Hodge’s love story, journalism career, and a city’s intricate Prohibition politics with witty dialogue and captivating details.
For his first novel in two decades, Pulitzer-winning author Mamet goes back to his own hometown as the setting for a complicated plot. Mamet dives into 1920’s Chicago with Al Capone’s gangs in the South, the Irish up North dispersed through the police ranks, the Jews who find themselves caught (and killed) in between, and, of course, the world of Hodge and his colleagues: the newspaper.
The archetypal hero of the story, Mike Hodge, leaves his home to fight in the First World War as a fighter pilot. He returns and settles down in Chicago as a journalist for the Tribune when he falls in love with Annie Walsh, an Irish girl more closely involved with his reporting sources than he could have guessed. Hodge’s tragedy strikes when Walsh is shot dead in his own apartment in front of his eyes, leading to a quest to find the person who killed the love of his life. His ruthless aim, along with his pain and thirst for revenge, drives his professional need to pursue the next lead, the next great story of crime to report for the paper.
As with any good crime story, “Chicago” is full of twists and surprises. The novel’s supporting characters develop as equally well as the lead characters. Amongst them is Hodge’s fellow veteran, colleague, and often accomplice, Clement Parlow. Parlow provides a contrast in humor and heart to Hodge, driving some of the novel’s best dialogue. One would expect no less from Mamet, a seasoned and renowned playwright.
Their conversations take place in settings spread throughout the city that Mamet returns to again and again, establishing familiarity. In a sense, each scene feels like the cuts of a play, as Mamet turns a stage experience to paper. There’s the City Room, the office where Hodge and Parlow write their stories, where Parlow constantly yells for the copy boy. There’s Mike’s apartment, of which readers see glimpses during Mike’s flashbacks of Annie in his room. There’s the Budapest Cafe, “a luncheon resort, sufficient superior to a coffee shop or lunch counter to appeal to the genteel, the shabby-genteel, and those who enjoyed, or did not mind, their company,” where Hodge often brings Annie during their “courtship.” There’s the Ace of Spades, a whorehouse run by Peekaboo, Hodge’s friend who knows the ins-and-outs of the city thanks to the powerful men who come through and the love affairs they bring with. The list goes on, each place holding a myriad of stories.
Even as a bystander writing about the crimes in the city, Hodge follows the “principle” of the City Room, where the reporters “felt themselves entitled to whatever copy they could convert into preference, sex, or cash.” Mamet crafts the tales and experiences of these journalists cleverly, exposing their own struggles for a claim to fame underlying their everyday struggle to get the new scoop in an age of corruption. Other ’20s era sentiments shine through in the immigrant divisions deeply entrenched in the metropolis, the racial segregation not yet questioned, and Hodge’s sexist love for Annie, lusting to “wife” her into a stay-at-home mother.
As Hodge pushes on with his own investigation, he realizes that his own attempts to link murders amidst the violent powerhouses of the city aren’t enough to uncover the truth. His discovery is dark enough to become the next exposé of the paper, but Hodge has no intention of writing that story. Instead, he seeks revenge, even though he “had not fired a handgun since France.” The answers to Annie’s death aren’t particularly important, but Mamet’s ending is nonetheless powerful.
With humor sprinkled amongst even the most dire of situations, Mamet’s “Chicago” is an engaging read. The characters draw readers in, while Mamet’s narratives on the settings in the city vividly connects them. Mamet’s new novel is a treasure, a piece of fictitious history entrenched in an era of violence and love.

As Passion Pit would say, 1985 was a good year—for pop culture, that is. After all, there was U2, and Blondie, and music still on MTV. Here, we rank the best pop culture of 1985. 
5. “And She Was,” The Talking Heads“And She Was” is the psychedelic first single from the Talking Heads’ album “Little Creatures.” Based on “a blissed-out hippie-chick in Baltimore” that lead singer David Byrne knew, the song chronicles the “pleasant elevation” of the titular “she,” who awakens from a drug trip to find herself floating above the houses and factories: “The world was moving, she was right there with it and she was.” The song’s unusual modulation from verse to chorus to bridge marks its sonic individuality, while its lyrical anaphora (“and she was, … / and she was, … / and she was…”) spins its drug-addled stupor into repetitive circles. Drummer Chris Frantz said in an interview with WNCX that the song’s main character is a woman who levitates above her earthly neighbors. “The guy who’s writing the song is in love with her and he kinda wishes she would just be more normal and, like, come on back down to the ground, but she doesn’t,” Frantz said. “She goes floating over the backyard and past the buildings and the schools and stuff and is absolutely superior to him in every way.”
4. Calvin and HobbesBill Watterson’s comic strip about a precocious boy and his anthropomorphic stuffed tiger charmed readers when it first appeared in newspapers in November 1985. Like Charles Schulz’s “Peanuts” characters, Calvin and Hobbes existed as children in their own fictional universe. But unlike Charlie Brown, Calvin’s language belonged to an adult, and the subjects, which ranged from satire to philosophy, were far more cerebral than the shenanigans of Linus and Lucy. Named respectively for the 16th century theologist and the 17th century Enlightenment philosopher, “Calvin and Hobbes” explored not only the imaginative world of children, but also the irony of the intellectual and often cynical humor with which Watterson imbued their dialogue: In one strip, Calvin asks his father, “Dad, are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched?” Critics heralded the comic, which ran until 1995, as the last great newspaper comic strip before the age of the Internet.
3. “The Handmaid’s Tale”Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel imagined a future New England called “Gilead” that legally regulates sex and reproduction. Offred, the protagonist and narrator, is a handmaid, one of Gilead’s many mandated child-rearing slaves. “The Handmaid’s Tale” explores the role of what Atwood termed “speculative fiction,” a genre that imagines a possible future “which could really happen.”
The novel garnered plenty of acclaim during the era of its release, winning the Governor General’s award and the Arthur C. Clarke award. But it gained a particular resonance after the 2016 election of Donald Trump and the rising threat toward women’s autonomy over their own bodies, including the defunding of Planned Parenthood and the ideological opposition toward abortion and birth control. In 2017, Hulu produced a television adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss, which won several Emmys and Golden Globes. In her Golden Globes acceptance speech, in the midst of the height of the #MeToo movement, Moss quoted the text itself, saying, “We lived in the gaps between the stories,” before revising the quote: “We no longer live in the blank white spaces at the edge of print. We no longer live in the gaps between the stories. We are the story in print, and we are writing the story ourselves.” 
2. “Back to the Future”Great Scott! “Back to the Future” made time travel, driving at 88 miles per hour, and Oedipal complexes cool. The highest grossing film of 1985 tells the story of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a 17-year-old whose eccentric mentor Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) transforms a DeLorean into a time machine. But after an ill-timed run-in with Libyan terrorists, Marty travels back to 1955 and gets mixed up in the social fabric of his own parents: his stammering geek of a father (Crispin Glover), a bully who wields power over his family (Thomas F. Wilson), and his mother (Lea Thompson), who inadvertently falls in love with him. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, “Back to the Future” was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning for sound mixing. Its story reverberated throughout generations—the kind of movie whose references cemented themselves as a quintessential part of pop culture (“1.21 Gigawatts!”), alongside “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones.” You don’t have to time travel to the future to know that “Back to the Future” is forever.

Livestreaming is a cultural phenomenon. People apparently like watching others play video games as much, if not more, than playing themselves, and these fans have contributed to the rising popularity of streaming sites like Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Mixer. Eccentric personalities and top-tier gamers are taking over this new form of entertainment, with tens of thousands of concurrent viewers attending their live sessions.
One such player, a former Halo professional, has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few months. Tyler “Ninja” Blevins has over 50,000 subscribers on Twitch and has amassed over two million followers on the platform. On Twitch, subscribers pay the entertainer monthly, while followers are akin to subscriptions on YouTube. According to statistics found on “SocialBlade,” which tracks user statistics across a variety of sites, Blevins had only 500 thousand followers in September 2017. In less than six months, he has managed to grow his channel by over 250%.
Those numbers are staggering, but after watching his stream, they are not surprising. Blevins streams “Fortnite: Battle Royale” almost exclusively, and the meteoric rise of that game has definitely helped propel viewership. It’s not all about the game, though. Blevins clearly has talent as an entertainer and a gamer. His ability to become one of the top players in any game he plays is nearly unrivaled.
The real surprise here is the massive explosion of growth and wealth being produced. The number of followers and subscribers may seem abstract if you are not familiar with Twitch, so let's put it this way: At 50,000 subscribers, Ninja is earning upwards of $150,000 per month. That figure excludes donations, revenue from YouTube and sponsors, and any other business dealings he may be involved with. The sheer amount of money being thrown his way is astronomical. At first thought, it just does not seem possible. Ninja plays videos games for a living and streams himself doing it—often to crowds of over 100,000 people, which could fill entire football stadiums. He recently hosted a stream that was entirely dedicated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and raised over $100,000 in a single day.
What lies ahead for platforms like Twitch, and how will gamers and viewers across the world shape them? It is hard to say for certain, but it does not seem like the momentum is stopping any time soon. The influence that live entertainment has is constantly growing, and due to entertainers like Ninja, platforms like Twitch and Mixer may become mainstream.
Ninja has been doing his thing for years, but now all the pieces have come together to propel him to Twitch fame. From “Fortnite” to Twitch’s growth to other prominent members of the Twitch community taking time off, all the stars are aligned for Ninja. Sometimes being the good guy (and being ridiculously good at video games) does pay off.

The glut of new shows that January and February bring each year has passed, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still new shows being released. Here are five to get excited about:
5.) “The Looming Tower” (Hulu, February)
The new miniseries, premiering on Wednesday (Feb. 28), appears to be one of the most anticipated shows of the winter. Based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Lawrence Wright, it provides a rare glimpse of the rivalry between the CIA and FBI in the late 1990s that—according to its creators—“may have inadvertently set the path for the tragedy of 9/11.” The cast includes Jeff Daniels as the chief of the New York FBI’s counterterrorism unit and Peter Sarsgaard as a CIA analyst. Also present: Alec Baldwin, guest-starring as ex-CIA director George Tenet.
4.) “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs” (Netflix, TBD)
“Fargo” was only the beginning of the Coen Brothers’ affair with television. Their TV-directorial debut, “The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,” is scheduled to air later this year on Netflix. The anthology will follow six different tales about the American West, starring Tim Blake Nelson (“O Brother, Where Art Thou?”).  The production company, Annapurna Pictures, promised “an innovative television and theatrical integrated approach.” This promise, along with the remarkable track record of the Oscar-winning filmmakers, make the project seem particularly promising.
3.) “Sharp Objects” (HBO, TBD)
After the recent success of his “Big Little Lies” miniseries, the French-Canadian director Jean-Marc Vallée is back. His new show will be an adaptation of “Sharp Objects,” a novel by Gillian Flynn (“Gone Girl”), which tells the story of Camille, a crime reporter who returns to her hometown after spending time in a psychiatric hospital to cover the murder of two girls. Back at home, she has to face her strict mother and her spoiled half-sister. The cast will include Amy Adams (who is signed on as an executive producer as well), Patricia Clarkson, and Chris Messina (“Damages,” “The Mindy Project”).
2.) “The First”(Hulu, TBD)
The past few months have been challenging for Netflix’s “House of Cards,” but its creator, Beau Willimon, seems to have moved on. His new series, “The First,” a Hulu and the British Channel 4 co-production, will depict “the first human mission to Mars.” The sci-fi series, starring Sean Penn and Natascha McElhone (“Californication”), will be set in the near future. Most of the details have been kept secret, but Hulu announced that the story will focus “not only on the astronauts, but also on their families and loved ones, as well as the ground team on Earth.”
1.) “Kidding” (Showtime, TBD)
14 years after they made you sob in “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” actor Jim Carrey and director Michel Gondry are back together. And this time, it seems, they are going to make you smile. Their new project, which will be broadcasted on Showtime, will depict a crisis in the life of Jeff, aka Mr. Pickles, an icon of children’s television, whom the show’s creators define as “a beacon of kindness and wisdom to America’s impressionable young minds.” “Kidding” will mark Carrey’s first regular television role since his appearance on the 1990‘s sketch comedy show, “In Living Color.”

On Sunday night, HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” returned for the start of its fifth season, featuring host John Oliver’s satirical take on the news. If that summary sounds like “The Daily Show,” it’s not a coincidence. Oliver rose to fame as a “Daily Show” correspondent, and he hosted the program when then-host Jon Stewart was absent for eight weeks in 2013. A key factor that distinguishes “Last Week Tonight” from “The Daily Show” and its ilk, however, is that Oliver is on air only once a week, whereas most of his fellow TV comics are on every weeknight.
At its best, “Last Week Tonight” is wisely aware that its once-a-week format renders it poorly equipped to keep up with daily events, and it bows out of the headline-parody game altogether. Instead, episodes feature investigative-journalism-style reports on events that do not make American front pages but nonetheless have significant impact here and around the world. A particularly memorable episode shines a harsh light on the greedy practices of televangelists and features Oliver establishing his own “church,” “Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption,” to demonstrate the ease with which groups can take advantage of the tax-exempt status enjoyed by churches.
The Season Five premiere, however, seems to forget what makes “Last Week Tonight” special, as Oliver devotes much of the episode to satirizing the recent activities of President Trump. “Last Week Tonight” has targeted Trump before, and as before, the choice to focus on an oft-discussed element of the news hurts the show in two ways. First, it positions Oliver as a competitor with the plethora of other TV hosts for whom Trump jokes are bread and butter, most notably Stephen Colbert and Trevor Noah. Oliver’s writing team is great, and his delivery is often funny, but his eyes-popping-out-of-head incredulous shtick can feel un-humorously overwrought, particularly compared to Colbert and Noah’s calmer styles. Oliver’s presentation does not change depending on his subject matter, but when “Last Week Tonight” covers the same material as funnier comedians than Oliver, it invites unflattering stylistic comparisons.
The second way that covering Trump and other headline items hurts “Last Week Tonight” is by stripping the show of its educational power. Oliver’s satires of televangelists or the morally dubious world of debt-buying likely gives many viewers new information, and even when he covers foreign events of little direct importance to American life, viewers come away better-informed about the world than they were when they started watching.
True, the new segment about Trump is longer than most of its analogues (20 minutes to Colbert and Noah’s standard 5-10 minutes) and likely contains more information, but this extra time is unlikely to change anyone’s mind about Trump or to cause him to reverse any of the policies that Oliver discusses. When “Last Week Tonight” chooses issues of less prominence (and of a more manageable stature than the president of the United States), the effects of Oliver’s educational-comic sermons are palpable. He has arguably spurred a Federal Communications Commission policy reversal, changes in national civil forfeiture laws and New York City bail requirements, and many similar societal improvements. When “Last Week Tonight” lambastes Trump, on the other hand, the show becomes one of many, good for a laugh and not much more.
“Last Week Tonight” has demonstrated tremendous potential to bring about change, and its deep-dive investigative approach sets it apart from shows with a similar comic-liberal bent. Episodes that focus on relatively obscure topics are more common than the relatively disappointing ones like the latest episode. As long as John Oliver and company remember what they do best—in terms of both educating their viewers and changing the world—the show will remain among the most brilliant things on TV.

When certain identities are underrepresented in mainstream media, it becomes easy to rely on all-encompassing—and supposedly universal—narratives to see, to construct, and to interpret.
What happens when we notice the careful ways black artists build entire worlds? We should consider details and gestures that comprise a life: a pendulum-swinging pair of hips as a man mimes the rhythms of boxing in order to warm up, waiting for a broken car battery to reheat itself in the unforgiving cold, the intricate execution of a braid making its way down the tender crown of a head. This world-building spells the possibility of an alternate future. While viewing “Black Panther” earlier this week, I wondered what art would look like if this were the standard—blackness in the background and foreground, blackness in the extras you don’t pay attention to and in the main characters you want to be.This felt possible to me two weeks earlier when I was at the Harvard Film Archive, which was running a two-week series of several works by the Ohio-based filmmaker Kevin Jerome Everson. Titled “Cinema and the Practice of Everyday Life,” the series featured 22 out of some 144 films, a testament to not only Everson’s work ethic, but also his determination to painstakingly capture the world he knows best. Not once did a white—or non-black, for that matter—person appear. This felt like both the most and least natural thing in the world. Everson attended two of the screenings. I attended the second, which featured seven films: “Round Seven,” “Ears, Nose and Throat,” “Undefeated,” “Emergency Needs,” “Fe26,” “Company Line” and “Ninety-Three.” As he fielded questions from the audience, a pragmatic energy radiated from his body. Everson seemed to be a man who worked not from a vantage point of self-serious intellectual pursuit, but rather from one of unadulterated, down-to-earth joy.As the title of the series suggests, Everson emphasizes the quotidian throughout his work. His films often take place in seemingly-mundane locales: medical offices, basketball courts, basements, sidewalks. Despite their simplicity, these settings become sites where the past and present merge, which in turn allows Everson’s films to read as grounded and embodied historical texts. In the opening scenes of “Company Line,” workers in Mansfield, Ohio relay stories about when, how, and from where families living in their neighborhood had arrived. As they name cities and states, it becomes clear that their familial lineage is part of the Great Migration, the mass movement of black Americans north during the earlier part of the twentieth century. Here, as well as in other films, Everson explores the role of labor and socioeconomic mobility as an integral part of the proliferation of black life.In Everson’s films, history is not merely expressed through image, but also through sound. In “Round Seven,” Everson reimagines and stages an infamous match between two Mansfield boxers, Art McKnight and Sugar Ray Leonard. Cut in between each “round” is a return to the modern-day, when an unnamed woman circles public spaces holding a scorecard, her body a stand-in for the scorekeepers of the past. As this occurs, the past unfolds into the present, amplified by continuous narration of the match. This voice-over is authoritative, a voice that contains and channels history. In “Ears, Nose and Throat,” the mechanic beeping of a hearing test collides with a woman’s account of witnessing a shooting, raising questions about the role of the black woman’s body as both witness and instrument. During the screening of “Company Line,” a few members of the audience chuckled when an industrial worker appeared on-screen wearing a Harvard letterman jacket. I wondered what this reaction revealed about the covert class dynamics in the room and about the position of many audience members as Cambridge residents and affiliates of an “elite” institution, as people who had the time and energy to look at a blank screen and wonder about the life of “Others.” What, exactly, was so funny? Since viewing Everson’s films, I find myself thinking more about the nobility of physical labor. I think and work within a bubble that values intellectualism, and very often the esoteric or avant-garde. Yet there is much labor that goes unseen in the slim hours of the day, when I am nearly-late on an assignment, tucked into the cavernous basement of Sever or the tidy cubicles of the library. Meanwhile there are bodies shifting into movement, clearing the snow, spreading the salt, unlocking the doors.

The music video for “God’s Plan” opens with a title card: “The budget for this video was $996,631.90.” A second title card follows on its heels, alleging that Drake and his label “ gave it all away.” Over the course of the video, Drake saunters through the streets of Miami, brightening the days of unsuspecting community members with donations—groceries, scholarships, cars, literal stacks of cash.
The music video sets a tone of optimism at the very start, as an older man reminisces about how he knew Denzel Washington and Wesley Snipes in his youth. He goes on to note that though he doesn’t make a living comparable to them, he enjoys similar levels of good health. At the end of the monologue, the man notes, “It’s a good life, it’s a good life.” He doesn’t need all the money in the world to feel happy.
This attitude embodies the sentiment Drake expresses throughout the video. Drake gives away a million dollars because he doesn’t need it to enjoy a good life. Despite this generosity, Drake admits that he still suffers no shortage of haters: “It’s a lot of bad things / That they wishin’ / … On me.” However, he refuses to let this spite perturb him, as he indicates through his goofy dance moves and beaming smile.
The people featured in this video possess this smile as well. Drake doesn’t paint the depicted Miami neighborhood as sullen, nor does he paint himself as a saint, drying the tears of the weary. Instead, Drake portrays himself as a man who simply likes to help out and party with the people: In a scene about halfway through the video, he jumps up and down with a hallway full of high schoolers as the beat to one of the stanzas in the song drops. At the end of the video, the man from the introduction says once again, “It’s a good life, it’s a good life.” After getting caught up in the upbeat rhythm of the song, and involuntarily smiling along with all of the joyous people in the video, any viewer would feel obliged to agree.

A sea of raised hands stretches as far as the eye can see, growing and swelling with the thunderclouds above them. Rising from this human wave like a modern Noah is none other than enigmatic rap superstar Kendrick Lamar. The music video for Lamar and R&B goddess SZA’s “All the Stars,” the pair’s single from the recent “Black Panther” soundtrack, is visually stunning and mysterious. One would expect nothing less from a creative team that includes Lamar, SZA, and director Dave Meyers. Meyers, whose previous work includes the music videos for Lamar’s “LOYALTY.” and SZA’s “Drew Barrymore,” weaves dance, color, and symbolic imagery to craft a video that is beautiful and open to interpretation.
While there isn’t a linear “plot” so to speak, the back and forth between the two artists ties the verses and choruses together. A shot of Lamar standing in the center of a group of children, all looking to him for guidance, fades into a glittering galaxy whose stars form the shape of the continent of Africa. The camera rushes forward, travelling light years through layers of stars to reveal none other than SZA, carefree and dancing amid the floating stars. The deep red, purple, and black hues of her jumpsuit stand out against the midnight blues of the galaxy she is inexplicably standing within. A black cape extends behind her, moving just enough to make you wonder if Saturn’s rings are really just a distant time-lapse of SZA in her glowing outfit dancing circles around the planet.
SZA exudes joy in all of her movements and vocals, while Lamar plays her more reserved counterpart. He sits silently in a red suit, his chair flanked by stoic men in formal wear standing out against the makeshift metal houses behind them. As Lamar’s verse plays, the camera pans over the women, children, and dancers around him as bombs explode in the background. Lamar doesn’t begin to lip-sync until the line, “I hate people that feel entitled,” on which he stands and begins to speak directly to the camera.
From here, imagery takes over completely as the view shifts to images rife with bright colors, designs, and symbols. In a direct reference to the film the song was created for, a leather clad Lamar leads a pack of black panthers through a forest of black, burnt trees, the only pop of color existing in the form of his lime-green, patterned headwrap. SZA dances once again in her galaxy, bathed in blood-red lighting, only to materialize seconds later in a shallow, pink pool. Amid patterns of red, black, green, and yellow, she floats, flanked on all sides by dancing women draped in pink feathers. These transitions from one elaborate scene to the next become more and more frequent, as we see SZA dancing in the midst of a decorated army dressed in blue, or Kendrick wandering between statuesque, powerful women draped in gold.
At the video’s conclusion, SZA sings off frame as Kendrick walks up to a row of goddesses three times his height and draped in gold and jewelry. He looks up at them, and begins to look back down. We are transported through the constellation of Africa for the final time, through SZA’s hair. It is glorious.

In 2017, for the first time in history, hip hop/R&B officially became the most consumed music genre in America. Consumption of rap music increased by 25 percent from 2016, recording the second-largest growth of any music category. In fact, the past few years have marked groundbreaking success for the rap and hip-hop industries, as the genre has progressed from taboo to widely accepted.
Moreover, the average age of hip hop listeners is the lowest of all major music genres in the United States. Because of this impressionable demographic, the content of hip hop and rap music has particular potential for impact. Hip hop and rap music effectively convey significant and powerful messages, from expressing grievances in the black community to illustrating the vision that even the poorest black Americans from the most dangerous neighborhoods can achieve wealth and fame—a potent image for young black people in those very situations.
But along with these positive messages come more insidious connotations. One such example is the saturation of rap and hip hop music with misogynistic lyrics that hypersexualize and give little to no respect to women. On Feb. 24, 18 out of 25 of Billboard’s top rap songs—most of which are also classified as hip hop—had lyrics referring to women as “bitches,” “hoes,” or “whores.” While the core message of most songs do not line up with such belittling rhetoric, these words saturate the songs with misogynistic undertones, and their presence in so many top songs indicates how pervasive said undertones are.
The overt lionization of infidelity is similarly prevalent and problematic. One doesn’t have to venture far to find an example of this glorification. In “Gummo,” number 12 on Billboard’s Top 25 as of Feb. 24, 6ix9ine says, “Your girl on my phone / she wanna fuck but… I only want the jaw / that’s really all I use her for as I kick her out the door.” The next song on the chart, A$AP Ferg’s “Plain Jane,” contains equally demeaning lyrics: Towards the middle of the song, he says, “I fuck yo bitch for the irony.” These misogynistic lyrics run contrary to the progression of gender equality. At a time when some of the nation’s most power leaders have undercut the social strides we have made as a country, it is important to be vigilant in denouncing misogyny and to be careful to not take these aspects of rap and hip-hop to heart.
This is especially important in the black community, both because black Americans represent the largest percentage of consumers of hip-hop and because the creators of the genre’s music are predominantly black. If lyrics are ever going to positively evolve, it is important that young, aspiring rappers do not internalize these messages. In addition, trends in family composition, like single-parent households, are more prevalent in the black community than in any other American racial group. According to a study in “Demographic Research,” a journal on population sciences, children born or raised outside of families with married parents may experience diminished wellbeing. These relationship trends are due to a conglomeration of factors, including the current disproportionately high incarceration and poverty rates in the black community. It is difficult to directly measure the impact that misogynistic music lyrics have on the black community, but by taking care to internalize the positive messages in rap and hip hop, and disregard the negative undertones, listeners can better promote a culture of respect for women.
This, however, does not mean that censorship is the answer—though a reevaluation is certainly warranted, and not just for rap. Misogyny manifests itself widely and across genres from rock and roll to country music. Instead of censorship, consumers of rap and hip hop who will ultimately become the genre’s creators should be cognizant of the  messages that they subconsciously integrate into their thoughts, actions, and vocabulary. Words are powerful, and consistent auditory exposure to an ideal can have concrete effects on people’s mentality. This principle is indicated by the “mere exposure effect,” which states that people develop preferences for stimuli to which they are repeatedly exposed. Verbal influence can yield positive or negative effects on behavior. In a bid to make America a more socially equitable place, rap and hip hop consumers should try to optimize the positive effects, and minimize the misogyny in the music they listen to.

Black people have disappointed me this Black History Month. Specifically black Christians.
It’s been nearly two weeks, and I’m still disappointed and hurt by the hateful rhetoric that “ex-gay” speaker Jackie Hill-Perry spewed at Harvard College Faith and Action’s Doxa meeting. While I’ve heard plenty of pastors, church-goers, and even non-Christian people say that homosexuality is sinful, hearing that message from a black woman who looks like me made it hit a little closer to home. It hurt even more to know that we have similar interests: I was intrigued to learn that she’s also an advocate for racial justice, a cause that I’m extremely passionate about. Initially, I had the smallest glimmer of hope that she might talk about racism within the church instead of how I and the rest of my community are inherently broken. But alas, it was not to be. During her speech, I heard nothing about racial reconciliation and far too much about “loving,” “Biblical” ways to ostracize BGLTQ people.
I can still hear the black women in the audience, sitting just a few feet away from me, shouting out “amen” throughout her speech. I wonder if they would’ve passionately shouted those same “amen”s if her message had been about the inherent inferiority of black people.
This isn’t the first time that religion has been used as an excuse to discriminate against and dehumanize marginalized groups. For centuries now, white Christians have been using twisted Biblical interpretations to justify their own racism.
In the 19th century, pro-slavery Christians frequently cited a Bible verse about Noah cursing the descendants of his son Ham to be “the lowest of slaves.” Though the color of Ham’s skin was never mentioned in the Bible, these Christians became convinced that black people were the descendants of Ham and thus destined to be slaves.
The Bible also features many verses in support of slavery. One of the more explicit ones is this: “Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy slaves… You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.”
Clearly, many white Christians obeyed that verse to the letter. They stole black people from their homes and then set up an international slave trade system to buy and sell said stolen black people. When slave owners died, they “bequeath[ed] them to [their] children.” They couldn’t “rule over [their] fellow” white people “ruthlessly” because white people were entitled to basic human rights. Interestingly, this verse comes from Leviticus, the book which also contains the well-known verse about how I and members of my BGLTQ community are “abominations” who deserve death.
This Biblical racism didn’t end with abolition. In 1963, a few years before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was brutally murdered by a white man, he called out the racism in churches, saying, “I think it is one of the tragedies of our nation... that eleven o’clock on Sunday morning is one of the most segregated hours, if not the most segregated hour, in Christian America… Any church that stands against integration and that has a segregated body is standing against the spirit and the teachings of Jesus Christ.”
Another parallel between homophobia and racism is the fact that Bob Jones University, a well-known Christian college, didn’t drop its ban on interracial dating and marriage until the year 2000. Their reluctance came from their belief that God intentionally made different races after humans tried to reach heaven by building the Tower of Babel, and thus interracial couples having multiracial children would derail God’s plan.
For centuries now, white Christians have used the Bible to “prove” that black people are inferior, justify discrimination on the basis of race, and make black people unwelcome in predominantly white spaces. This is nothing new, and you can find plenty of black Christians and black people in general calling that racism out; Jackie Hill-Perry herself has spoken to the issues surrounding police brutality and the problems with claiming to not “see race.” But we must also recognize that, for centuries now as well, cisgender, heterosexual Christians have used the Bible to justify homophobic and transphobic worldviews. And too often, advocates for racial justice like Hill-Perry will either use the Bible to spew hateful rhetoric about BGLTQ people or simply leave us out of conversations altogether.
It’s not enough to be “woke” on race if you’re also homophobic or transphobic. In fact, intersectionality demands that you cannot be “woke” on race and also homophobic or transphobic. Black queer and transgender people exist, and you cannot support black liberation unless you support the liberation of all black people. “Black Lives Matter” includes BGLTQ black people. You can’t pick and choose which members of the black community matter and then throw the rest under the bus, especially when those members you want to ignore have been trailblazers in the movement for black liberation.
This Black History Month, let’s not forget the history of racist, white Christians using the Bible as a weapon against black people. But let’s also not forget the history of homophobic and transphobic Christians using the Bible as a weapon against BGLTQ people, and the ways in which many black Christians feel absolved from this because they’re “woke” on race. And most importantly, let’s not forget that all this seemingly historical bigotry is still present today.
Without active change, these histories will continue to repeat themselves. This Black History Month, we must decide to do and be better, refusing to let injustice snake its way into our history books anymore.

In the aftermath of the Feb. 14 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., high school students around the country have been protesting in support of stricter gun safety laws, in many cases staging walkouts to express their positions. On Friday, College spokesperson Rachael Dane offered a statement confirming, “Those who engage responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms would not have their chances of admission compromised.” The College released the statement Monday, in slightly modified form, on its website.
We commend Harvard for making a statement during this politically tense time that affirms the administration’s support for students choosing to exercise their constitutional rights. At the same time, the College could and should have taken the opportunity to explicitly praise the peaceful, constructive nature of the protests its would-be students are undertaking, as this kind of civic engagement reflects well on the applicants involved.
As an admissions body, the role of the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid is to determine who will be most suited to life at the College and who will contribute to the community in the most meaningful ways. When considering an individual’s history of protest as relevant to admissions, the manner in which applicants are civically engaged should be the issue at hand, not the ideological beliefs behind the protest.
Applying to college can be a stressful process, during which applicants can feel scrutinized. Feeling a need to perform for picky observers can make people put aside their individuality and ideals in pursuit of an idealized image of perfection. In order to dispel this idea to make applicants understand that precisely what makes them most attractive to the College are their principles, their willingness to be engaged, and their individuality, the College admissions office should have been more public about its position on this matter. It could have followed the lead of many other schools by using social media to share its stance, for instance.
Nevertheless, the admissions office was right to not explicitly siding with the protests, unlike an officer in its Yale counterpart. By not endorsing a specific ideological stance, the admissions office successfully walked the line in condoning respectful protest without ostracizing those prospective applicants who may not share a stance with those protesting.
There are times when Harvard as an institution must take a stand on a political issue. However, the College’s admissions office rarely need do so. Almost always, if the administration were to take a stand on a political issue, it would be problematic to make admissions decisions based on students’ positions on the matter.
For these reasons, we’re glad Harvard made a statement clarifying the College’s admissions policy concerning peaceful, civil protests of any ideological stripe. We hope that high school students will take the statement at its word and freely pursue civically engaged lives without fear of admissions consequences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a different chapter of Harvard College Faith and Action’s history, I co-led a discussion group for queer Christians. The group, known as Ask, Seek, Knock, or ASK, met every other week from 2014 to 2016 with long breaks for school holidays. Unlike most Christian communities, we chose not to have any official stance on what Christians call the Side A/Side B debate.
Side A Christians think that the passages in Leviticus 18 and the New Testament condemning homosexuality only apply to the same-sex relationships common at the time. They see modern marriage between two men or women as contributing to human flourishing. They believe these unions honor God, who designed some people to be attracted to members of the same sex. As such, they believe the Church should recognize and celebrate gay marriage.
Side B Christians agree that ancient homosexual relationships differ widely from modern gay marriage but believe the Bible prohibits the latter as well. Citing Genesis 2, Matthew 19, and Ephesians 5, they believe that marriage between a man and a woman uniquely symbolizes the union between Christ and the Church. For Side B Christians, choosing to pursue a relationship with a member of the same sex is morally out-of-bounds, since it does not lead to a marriage between two members of the opposite sex.
When the conversations in ASK were academic, we often discussed Side A and Side B. Most of us were still making up our minds on the matter. But for a group of queer Christians, this is not primarily an academic topic, and we quickly moved on to discussing our personal lives.
In leading ASK, I glimpsed the depth and width of the wounds in this part of Christ’s body. Members often spoke of a pervasive loneliness, even among Christian friends. Several were terrified of coming out to their conservative parents. Many struggled with depression, and one lost his faith.
As a bisexual woman, I am often anxious in the many gendered spaces the Church provides. I am afraid of being seen as a snake in the grass. In particular, I don’t want to be deemed too perverted to work with children.
The Church has a passing awareness that queer people are more likely to be homeless, depressed, or suicidal, but ministries catering to us are few. The unsympathetic tone of Doxa two weeks ago is but one example of how out of touch the Church is with the anguish of queer Christians. To adapt, many drift to the fringes of religious community.
Recently, HCFA had at least one queer assistant Bible course leader, but she was asked to step down after beginning a relationship with another woman. In public statements regarding this decision, HCFA implied that they asked the woman to step down because she had not been celibate. Based on the woman’s recent clarification, HCFA leadership seems to have confused celibacy (no sexual activity) with chastity (appropriate relations). To illustrate the difference, a married woman having sex with her husband is chaste but not celibate. Side B Christians believe that a woman dating another woman is celibate but not chaste. In using imprecise language, HCFA has maligned and misrepresented the woman, undoubtedly causing her additional distress.
In addressing this conflict, Harvard demands that HCFA adopt the Side A view. A recent article in the Harvard Ichthus argued that the traditional Side B view is inherently hateful. I suspect a similar assumption underlies a recent Crimson editorial and the Office of Student Life’s choice to place HCFA on probation. As a Side B Christian, I disagree with the assertion that Christians must either be Side A or live in hate.
Side B runs against the grain of most people’s intuitions, including my own at first. I believe God made each human unique, complex, and beautiful. It makes me happy when people find partners who make them happy.
And yet when I read my Bible alongside arguments for Side A and Side B, this is where my conscience falls. Men and women are different, equal, and complementary, and their union produces life. (For a better articulation of Side B than I can give, consider reading the work of Richard Hays.) To be chaste, a queer Christian may either choose to marry a member of the opposite sex or remain single.
I aim to live out my Side B view in love. Almost always that means through actions, not words. My views do not shape how I vote or advise non-Christian friends. Rather, I aspire to foster communities like ASK where queer Christians feel renewed, embraced, and honored as beloved children of God. The Church has so much damage to undo, but faithful Side B Christians are striving for restoration even as we maintain our theological view.
In its defense of BGLTQ Christians, Harvard appears to be uninterested in the contours of Christian life. If Harvard wants to enforce its view of how Christian communities should operate, let it understand the debate it is entering.
If you were a Side B Christian, how would you lead? How would you make students feel welcome without compromising their spiritual development? How would you show them Christ, die for them daily? How would you lavish them with love? Before calling on HCFA’s leaders to publicly repent, it is worth asking the questions that weigh on their hearts.

I sit in the parlor of my great-grandmother Vara Tatik’s Yerevan apartment and listen to her breathe. Her face is warm, drawn back comfortably into a 92-year-old smile; her eyes shine behind glasses that are taped at the ends and the middle. Her hand is warm in mine, the skin smoothed from a lifetime at the kitchen sink, fingers hued red from cherry pits and ashy from the daily crossword she’d finished by 10 a.m. Her hair is so white, it’s almost blue.
I lean into her until I’m sure I feel myself humming with the same silent, smiling love that she radiates softly, tuning myself like a string until just the right amount of tension falls away and I slip into the dominant chord of her being. The window curtains flutter—apricot-colored like the scent on the breeze—and a few leaves fly in. We’re six floors up; there’s no elevator. My great-grandmother hasn’t left this room in seven years.
Across from us, my mother leans out of her chair, chin against her palm, listening to Vara Tatik tell us what her grandson—my mother’s cousin—is up to in Tatev, a village four hours outside the city, where he’s been transferred as a government physician. We all share a bowl of fresh sour cherries that walk the line between dark red and black, and we stain our fingers with their hue.
As my mother and Vara Tatik chat, my attention wanders to the speckled, oval portrait that hangs on the back wall above the half piano. A gold-and-blue frame surrounds a vignette of a dark-haired Armenian physician of some renown. Wire-rimmed oval glasses rest on the bridge of his severe, sharp nose, dark eyes drawn behind a mild brow and a large, wide forehead. He’s not smiling, but the photograph was taken so that my great-great-grandfather looks as if he’s gazing across the room, pensively engaged with the person to the left of and just behind me.
Vara Tatik notices my stare. My mom goes quiet.
“That is the only picture of my father I have left,” she tells me, more proud than sentimental.
Her voice is strong and reminds me of unabashed laughter, the kind that you throw across a picnic table in the family garden after your husband is suddenly pelted by a rapid-fire spray of cherry pits and you notice that the culprit is your great-granddaughter, perched like a sniper on the balcony above, literally red-handed.
I remember that day in the garden of my great-grandparents’ summer house in all its vibrant tones and hues: the bright blue of my grandmother’s fingers sliding over mine as she teaches me how to spit out and shoot the pits of the delicious sour cherries we’d collected, the same blue as the backwards snap of my fingers when I finally get the motion just right; the cherry pits’ stains on my great grandfather Norik Papik’s white undershirt, small and scarlet like bullet holes; his aging laughter alongside my great grandmother’s, a jubilant yellow like the sun through the cherry trees; the silvery-golden green of my mother’s gaze that eyed me dangerously from below, trying to hide its unconscious mirth.
The memory colors in the spaces between Vara Tatik’s words: bright blue, scarlet, smiling yellow, and silvery-golden green.
“They found it on the floor of his old home after the Turks came and destroyed it,” Vara Tatik continues. “It was the only thing that survived.”
My great-great-grandfather married twice. His first wife, with whom he had three children, fled the home without note or notice in 1915 under a bright blue Anatolian sky, taking the family jewels and children with her. They were caught by Ottoman gendarmes leading a death march outside of the village. All four were slaughtered, stained scarlet.
My great-great-grandfather escaped the gendarmes’ ransacking of his village, the destruction of his home, and the fatal, smiling yellow of the Syrian Desert sun. He fled east, where he eventually resettled and married the silvery golden green-eyed housemaid who would become my great-great-grandmother.
Looking closer at his portrait, I see faint but clear boot-prints that mar the photograph near the creases of his lapels and brush past his beard and right ear. Compulsively, I grab a napkin and try to wipe the scarlet cherry stains off my fingers.
“We never had it retouched, to remember,” Vara Tatik tells me. “Always remember.”
I can’t forget.

As the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences plans a long-awaited move to its new Allston campus, it's contending at home with a different kind of change: an increasingly diverse student body that requires new infrastructure and support.
In the past year alone, SEAS has helped three affinity groups, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, establish chapters at Harvard.
The move is part of a larger array of initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion at SEAS including surveys that collect data on minority student experiences, coffee chats with professors, and matching prospective freshman from underrepresented backgrounds with faculty advisors.
Despite the pace at which it has grown, SEAS has historically struggled to increase its diversity relative to other divisions of FAS, in both concentrator enrollment and in its faculty.
“We’re doing better, but in my mind, not good enough,” Francis J. Doyle III, Dean of SEAS, said during the school’s annual sophomore convocation earlier this month. “We need to be more reflective of the total college student body here, and that needs to be more reflective of society.”
There are currently 1,013 undergraduates enrolled in SEAS; of that number, 34 percent are women, and 20 percent are students from underrepresented minority backgrounds. Comparatively, according to The Crimson’s annual freshman survey, 49.3 percent of respondents from the class of 2020 identify as female and 26.4 percent of respondents identify as underrepresented minorities.
“We have an overarching engineering society but I think it’s also important that we have specific affinity groups so students can see themselves in a lot of different ways that they can get involved at SEAS,” said Christina Zaldana, SEAS’s administrator for advising programs and diversity outreach.
Affiliates of NSBE, SWE, and SHPE said that the official establishment of their groups was especially important in an environment like SEAS, where intense coursework and a lack of representation can often be discouraging.
“There were not a lot of groups that were oriented onto engineering other than like HCS or project-based clubs,” said Leticia Ortega ’19, secretary of SHPE. “I wanted something that would provide me a network where I could meet other student engineers, so we could discuss what it’s like to be an engineering or STEM student at Harvard.”
Sayo R. Eweje ’19, president of NSBE, said he thinks affinity groups play a particularly important role in providing guidance to new students from underrepresented backgrounds.
“Students who don’t necessarily identify with whatever the majority is in a certain place can become stressed out of the social dynamic or even the academic atmosphere of a community like SEAS if you don't have this sort of club or organization that fits you into the larger community to begin with,” he said.
NSBE, SWE, and SHPE are not the first SEAS-related affinity groups to form in recent years at the College. Women in Computer Science, for example, has had a strong campus presence, as has the Harvard Society of Black Students and Engineers (HSBSE). But members of the new groups say that their organizations offer two additional draws: specificity, and a relationship with a national umbrella organization.
“Other organizations already exist that tailor to different spaces such as Women in Computer science, which is a really well established group on campus, and there is Women in Math, as well. So I just really saw that need to fill that void or that space for women engineers,” said Allison Tsay ’19, President of SWE.
Eweje added that national conventions held by the umbrella organizations provide meaningful opportunities for group members to engage with the larger scientific community.
“That's really an opportunity for networking, just learning more about your field, just learning more about the people in your field, but also finding jobs and internship opportunities. That's part of what really motivated us to start this chapter to begin with,” he said.
That very connection to a national organization, however, led to friction when each of the groups attempted to gain recognition from the college.
The College’s policy, according to the Harvard College student Handbook, requires that recognized independent student organizations “make all policy decisions without obligation to any parent organization, national chapter, or charter, and without direction, interference or pressure from any such entity.”
The three affinity groups were forced to search for another approach—at which point SEAS stepped in. For nationally affiliated organizations, the College allows a University department or school to assume a sponsorship role and administrative supervision over the group. According to Zaldana, SEAS opted to sponsor the groups
“Because they were affiliated with national chapters, they had to do this process through SEAS,” she said.
As a “Sponsored Student Organization,” the affinity groups operate on behalf of SEAS, receive SEAS funding and select members with SEAS oversight.
Despite this sponsorship, the groups still faced a long wait for official recognition. NSBE and SHPE received recognition from the OSL in May 2017. SWE, on the other hand, received recognition only last week, according to Tsay.
“We only registered on the Hub as of two days ago, despite being an organization sponsored by SEAS for at least two years,” Tsay said.
At the same time, SEAS sponsorship has conveyed a host of benefits, including advising, funding, and office space.
“They did a lot of meetings, they got us a lot of funding, they did a lot of the heavy lifting that us as student groups didn’t really have access to do,” Ortega said.
According to Zaldana, the near carte-blanche support SEAS has given to NSBE, SWE, and SHPE is part of a renewed effort at SEAS to show that it values its students’ ideas, especially regarding diversity and inclusion.
“If students say they want a SWE, a HSBSE, and a SHPE, for whatever reason, because it’s going to make them more a part of the community, SEAS takes that seriously and we put funding and administrative support in place so they can move these groups forward,” she said. “If students are saying that having this in place will make their overall educational experience better, then we try to make it as administratively easy as possible.”
Zaldana said she also hopes helping affinity groups increase their visibility will allow students from underrepresented backgrounds who feel intimidated at SEAS “to see this network, because we want them to know if they’re struggling, if they’re alone, than they can see other groups that have gone through similar situations.”
She said, though, that the groups have not been around long enough to significantly impact enrollment rates for women and underrepresented minorities. Zaldana said she remained hopeful that the establishment of affinity groups will generate the impetus for a SEAS culture more comfortable with making strides toward greater diversity.
“We hope that it signals to students that they have another idea that would make things more inclusive, that they should feel free to speak to the Dean about it, or go to our office and let us know,” she said. “We hope that it lets students know that we’re open to change and we’re very open to student ideas about how to improve the community here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around fifty students, employees, and activists congregated in Emerson Hall Monday afternoon to hear a panel of three Harvard workers discuss the impact changes to Temporary Protected Status will have on individual workers and union power.
TPS is a program started by Congress in 1990 to offer temporary humanitarian relief in the United States to individuals whose home countries are affected by armed conflict and natural disasters. The Trump administration has recently scaled back TPS protections for immigrants from a number of countries,including El Salvador, Sudan, Haiti and Nicaragua.
Monday’s panel was a joint effort between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, UNITE HERE Local 26, and the 32BJ chapter of the Service Employees International Union—a unified effort of three unions representing Harvard workers that moderator Genevieve LeChat, a HUCTW member, said was uncommon.
Panelists included Harvard University Dining Services employee Martha I. Bonilla, and Harvard custodians and 32BJ SEIU members Doris Reina-Landaverde and  Julio A. Perez. Perez, who is also a member of the Massachusetts TPS Committee, emphasized his concern that the loss of TPS protections could mean a decline in union membership.
“Probably 70 percent of SEIU members are immigrants like me, with TPS, or with different problems,” Perez said. “The termination of the TPS—I don’t have to say, we all know—is going to ruin the unions. They will be broken down, because they will have very few members.”
Others agreed, mentioning that a union gains organizing strength from its membership.
“I think it’s a huge number [of TPS recipients], and they know if the unions lose these members, this will break the workers. It will affect the workers,” Reina-Landaverde said.
“The union is not the building or the organization. We are the union,” she added.
Some panel attendees said they believe the changes to TPS are one component of an effort by the Trump administration to weaken unions.
“This is the first opening salvo in an attack on unions. They’re led by immigrants; they’re rapidly growing. They are being dismantled by the administration because they give workers a chance to organize,” Ander P. Pierce, a Tufts student and panel attendee, said.
Members of the panel said they have been working to increase public awareness of TPS in the months before it is scheduled to expire.
For Perez, this included driving four hours for a six-minute interview on a local television channel about TPS last week.
“We are working against the clock. It has been set against us,” Perez said.  “We are moving forward.”
Others agreed and said they have been trying to show how the impact of the TPS changes extend beyond just those who have TPS status.
“What we are pleading today is not just to listen but to understand that this is your issue, whatever constituency you are part of,” Edward B. Childs, a chef in Adams House and chief steward of UNITE HERE Local 26, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 27, 2018 at 3:45 p.m.
Sir John Sawers, the former chief of the United Kingdom’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, discussed intelligence and national security at a Kennedy School event Monday afternoon.
Sawers is one of the Kennedy School’s Fisher Family Fellows, experts who have worked in government and reside on campus for a period of time to speak with Harvard affiliates and the greater public about their expertise and experiences .
Monday’s talk was part of the ongoing “Future of Diplomacy Project,” an initiative at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs dedicated to promoting a greater understanding of international politics. The event was moderated by former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, who now works at the Kennedy School, and Professor R. Nicholas Burns.
Sawers began his talk with a discussion of geopolitics and the merits of the Western model, moving on to argue that the U.S. and the U.K. are no longer the only dominant nations.
“We live in a world in which the West has been the dominant player. But the preponderance of the Western world has now passed,” Sawers said. “The Western model is now challenged because the performance of autocratic societies is tilted against our interests.”
According to Sawers, China has edged its way up in international relations, posing a threat to Western hegemony.
“China doesn’t rely on stealing our secrets. They are as innovative an economy and society as our own,” Sawers said. “We have to come to terms with their economic power, their technological innovation, and the reality that they are already an economy that surpasses the United States, and their investment in military capabilities will follow that path,” he added.
Sawers highlighted examples from the U.S. and the U.K.—specifically, the election of President Donald Trump and the U.K.’s withdrawal from the European Union—to back his claim that Western dominance and political stability are facing a variety of new threats.
“The Conservative and Labour parties are going out and embracing populist policies on the right and left, just as the Democrats and Republicans are doing in the U.S.,” he said. “What has for generations been a source of pride and stability in the U.S. and U.K.—the two-party system—has now become a vulnerability.”
Despite these global threats, Sawers said it is most important to focus first on domestic challenges.
“We must solve the problems at home before we can take on the greater problems facing the world. If you’re running an organization as big as the U.S. Army or as modest in size as MI6, keeping your institutions fresh and open to the world is important,” Sawers said.
The second half of the event involved a question and answer period, during which Sawers, Carter, and Burns fielded queries from among the roughly 100 audience members.
In response to a question about his decision-making process, Sawers emphasized the value of complying with legal and regulatory frameworks to maintain trust as a leader and retain the ability to make future decisions.
“I once almost had to resign from the MI6 because my decision-making process failed me,” Sawers said.
Sydney V. McDonald ’21 said she attended the event to supplement her classroom experiences. McDonald asked Sawers a question about contemporary value-oriented terrorism.
“Hearing his views on that, and getting to consolidate my preconceived notions with his perspective was cool,” she said. “I also enjoyed hearing how his opinions compare to those of some of my professors, and how different interpretations of foreign policy can come about through dialogue.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: February 27, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote to Professor R. Nicholas Burns. In fact, Sir John Sawers—not Burns—said he "almost had to resign from the MI6 because my decision-making process failed me."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This February, the City of Cambridge celebrated Black History Month through a series of initiatives and events that recognized the achievements of African Americans.
During the first City Council meeting of the month, the council unanimously adopted a policy order encouraging Cambridge residents to learn more about the important contributions of African Americans to the city and to the country. The order was authored by Mayor Marc C. McGovern and—through an amendment—Councillor E. Denise Simmons.
“Cambridge is home to one of the oldest African American communities in the nation, and has been home to groundbreaking leaders and history makers,” the order states.
Among the black Cantabrigians highlighted in the order are Maria Louise Baldwin, the Northeast’s first African-American public school principal; Joshua Bowen Smith, an abolitionist and former state representative; and Clement G. Morgan, the first African American elected to the Cambridge Board of Alderman.
McGovern said he wanted the order to be educational, rather than just a proclamation deeming February to be “Black History/African American History Month.” He also said he hopes Cambridge schools will continue to focus on teaching black history.
“It’s something we have to consistently self-evaluate and look at to make sure we’re not just teaching an Anglo, white history that you find in most textbooks,” McGovern said in an interview last week. “As a city and as a school district, we’re committed to that.”
McGovern also emphasized the significance of the city speaking up for values including inclusion and representation.
“It’s important for a city and elected officials and leaders in a community to step out and say, ‘We’re highlighting this,’” McGovern said.
This month, the city council also passed a policy order to create a permanent decal on Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority buses in order to honor Rosa Parks. Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui, who sponsored the order with Simmons, said she wants to acknowledge Parks’ role in the fight for equality.
“We really feel that we have to honor the heroes of the Civil Rights Movement, not just in February but all year long,” Siddiqui said at the city council meeting on Feb. 5. “It’s important to make this recognition part of the physical infrastructures in our community.”
Last Thursday, the mayor’s office hosted an open mic night at City Hall to celebrate Black History Month. At the event, residents shared their poetry and artwork. Yet according to Deputy Chief of Staff Ana M. Barros ’16, the city’s commitment to people of color extends to policy as well.
“We have events to bring people together for community building, but on the other end, we also have policy initiatives that will be rolling out this year to address racial disparities,” Barros said. “We know the black residents of Cambridge are affected disproportionately by things like affordable housing.”
McGovern said the city has both short-term and long-term goals to address racial inequalities, including programs to address housing and homelessness. The work that needs to be done, he said, “has to go beyond February.” Simmons, who also spoke at the city council meeting on Feb. 5, agreed.
“African American history is not a month. It’s actually three hundred and sixty-five days of the year,” Simmons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A foundation overseen by controversial libertarian billionaire Charles Koch has made several millions-dollar donations to the Harvard Kennedy School in recent years, prompting some debate within the school about the organization’s role and influence on campus.
In Dec. 2015, the Koch Foundation donated $2.9 million to the Kennedy School’s Taubman Center to support an initiative meant to boost education-related entrepreneurship. And in Nov. 2017, the Koch Foundation gave the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs a $1.8 million grant to launch “The Project on Grand Strategy, Security, and Statecraft,” a collaborative international studies program between the Kennedy School and MIT.
These grants follow about $10 million given to other institutions of higher education including Tufts University and the University of California at San Diego—both meant to foster research into foreign policy.
Given these recent donations, some Kennedy School students and outside observers have raised concerns about the clout they say the Koch foundation may wield at the school.
“They have a very clear libertarian, ideological, free-market fundamentalism agenda that they are pushing not only in the United States but also across the world,” Kennedy School student Jeff Rousset said. “When the dean says he is interested in bringing more conservatives voices to the Kennedy School, we have to ask, what are the voices in his head influencing those decisions?”
Kennedy School Dean Douglas Elmendorf recently said he is interested in bringing more conservative voices to campus.
Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an emailed statement Monday that the school does not follow rules established by donors.
“We accept funding from external sources, but those sources do not dictate or unduly influence the results of our research, our policy recommendations, what we teach, or whom we accept into our community,” Gavel wrote in the statement.
The billionaire Koch Brothers come under the national spotlight in recent years, with some criticizing them for their conservative views as well as a perceived lack of transparency regarding which Republican candidates the brothers choose to fund. The Koch foundation even inspired an app in 2013 which allowed shoppers to check if products are backed by the Koch brothers—thus permitting consumers to boycott those items.
Rousset said the Kennedy School should avoid advancing the agenda of a foundation he considers to be “one of the most undemocratic forces in the country.”
“[The Koch Brothers] are pushing a pro-business agenda regardless of the impact on the poor, the shrinking middle class, communities of color, and other vulnerable communities who get crushed by such policies,” Rousset said.
The Koch Foundation did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
Dave Levinthal, a journalist at the Center for Public Integrity—who has reported on the Koch Foundation in the past—said he thinks backlash is to be expected given what he called the Koch Brothers’ opaque financial support of conservative political candidates and organizations.
"When Koch foundations give money to public policy schools, particularly ones with a generally left-leaning student body and faculty, expect an angry reaction,” Levinthal wrote in an email Monday.
“Given this, schools must weigh the benefits of Koch money—grants sometimes reach into the millions of dollars—against the potential blowback of taking it,” Levinthal added. “Most universities take it.”
Professor Stephen Walt, the co-director of the “The Project on Grand Strategy, Security, and Statecraft,” said the grant given by the Koch Foundation will not impact their admissions decisions for the fellowship program.
“Once the money has been provided to us, then we control the program and they don’t have a role in selecting the fellows or deciding what the fellows write, selecting who we bring in as outside speakers or anything like that,” Walt said.
Nonetheless, some students at the Kennedy School say the donations are concerning.
“I think we need to be careful about what we freak out about,” said Matthew B. Mcdole, who is pursuing a masters in public policy. “I’m highly concerned if this is something where it’s a widespread effort to corporatize the center.”
“The Koch Brothers thing just touching one project at one of those research centers, it doesn’t feel to me like striking at the core of the education experience,” he added.
Either way, discussion over donors like the Koch foundation will likely linger at the Kennedy School for a while, according to Kennedy School Professor Khalil G. Muhammad. Muhammad said it is difficult to disentangle a donor’s gift from that organization’s politics.
“Donors do or foundations also do have a sense what’s important to them and a university is a good place because they can usually find a home for those interests and that influence,” Muhammad said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard professors from across disciplines discussed the challenges, impacts, and implications of the #MeToo movement at a panel Monday at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study’s Schlesinger Library.
The event focused on the #MeToo movement, an anti-sexual harassment campaign that has swept the world in recent months and brought down dozens of powerful men. Women have taken to social media to share their stories of sexual harassment with the hashtag #MeToo, prompting a national conversation about harassment in the workplace.
Monday’s panel was moderated by Ann Marie Lipinski, the curator for the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, and featured Harvard faculty members David I. Laibson, Evelynn M. Hammonds, Jill Lepore, and Jeannie S. Gersen. The event began with presentations from each panelist, and closed with questions from Lipinski and the audience.
Laibson, an economics professor specializing in behavioral economics, presented first, summarizing the sexual assault climate survey he helped design and administer in 2015. That survey revealed that 31 percent of senior undergraduate women at the College that year had experienced some form of sexual assault while at Harvard.
Laibson pointed out that the survey revealed numerous obstacles to reporting sexual assault that he said still hinder many students at Harvard.
“Our community may worry about the consequences of reporting sexual misconduct. How will this affect my friendships? How will this affect my relationship with the broader university community? Will my doctoral advisor ruin my career?” Laibson said.
Hammonds, a History of Science and African and African American Studies professor, focused on the specific challenges women of color at Harvard might face when weighing whether to report sexual harassment.
“We have to ask on this campus, what does accountability look like for black women students on this campus? Where do you go when you don’t feel comfortable with the Title IX office's ability to enforce accountability?” Hammonds said.
Hammonds added that black students often have difficulty trusting law enforcement officers, which may further limit avenues for reporting assault.
Lepore, a professor of American History, pointed to the shortcomings of feminist movements in the 1920s and 1960s, cautioning attendees that the #MeToo movement could have adverse effects as well.
“This movement might lead to great, long-lasting social justice, but history might also suggest it will lead to something quite, itself, terrible,” Lepore said.
Gersen, a law professor, spoke about the role of due process in adjudicating sexual assault cases, pointing to the need for clarity in definition and accountability for sexual assault charges.
“Due process is for innocent and guilty alike,” she said. “I am so heartened that the conversation has included actual real discussion about what we mean when we say sexual harassment, and what that behavior entails.”
The panel marked the 75th anniversary of Schlesinger Library, which houses a collection centered around the history of women in America. Library Director Jane Kamensky said the aim of the panel was to provide a forum for discussing pressing issues the #MeToo movement has raised.
“I think one of the goals of trying to seize a moment is for dialogue that interrogates how Harvard as a community of intellectuals and experts can help turn viral intensity into meaningful change so that students today, in 45 years, won’t have to say, ‘why are we still having this discussion?’” Kamensky said.
Kamensky said Schlesinger Library will pursue several projects to document the #MeToo movement.
“We’re in the early stages of a digital archiving project which we hope will give a permanent home to a group of digital assets related to this moment so that when people want to study it in a hundred years, there’s a central place to do it,” she said.

The Undergraduate Council approved a proposal of action for a multicultural center on campus at its Sunday meeting, sending the plan to the desk of Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
The proposal calls for administrators to organize a group of paid staff, College faculty, and undergraduates to research the history of minority communities at Harvard, and to examine multicultural centers at other universities.
The research would then be given to a separate body, tasked with deducing whether a physical space would be the most suitable course of action for the College. Finally, if the space is deemed necessary, a task force would be organized to formulate the specifics of what the center would look like, according to the UC’s plan.
The proposal comes as a result of a November UC referendum, which asked students whether the College should establish a “physical space for students” to “promote diversity, belonging, and inclusion on campus.” Because the referendum passed—with 1,402 of 2,074 undergraduate voters supporting it—the Council was required to draft and present a policy proposal to administrators.
Khurana’s endorsement is needed to move forward with the efforts to establish the center, which has long been a dream for some Harvard students. In addition to student support for the center, a September draft report from the University-wide task force for diversity and inclusion recommended the creation of centers for “Identity, Politics, and Culture” as well as “Inclusion and Belonging.”
Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20, who co-leads the Multicultural Center Coalition—the group spearheading efforts to establish a physical space on campus—said in an interview Monday that the proposal was a culmination of months of discussion.
“It’s been a very long process of meetings with student groups, administrators, student cultural [organizations], interns with the [Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations], and other offices on campus,” Abdelrahman said.
Last month, coalition leaders held a town hall to give students the opportunity to voice their opinions on the proposed multicultural center and provide advice to the coalition. Some of the feedback they received at the town hall was incorporated into the final proposal, according to Abdelrahman.
UC Student Relations Committee Chair Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 urged students to be patient, recognizing the long process outlined in UC’s plan. The proposal sets a deadline of early 2020—pushed back from spring of 2019 in an earlier draft—for the task force to complete its work.
“There is a new president happening, and that's going to take at least a year of reshuffling the administration,” Whittaker said. “The reason that we went until Spring of 2020 instead of Spring of 2019 is because we legitimately think it's important for this proposal to be successful.”
Abdelrahman agreed, arguing that rushing the process would endanger the long-term success of the proposed multicultural space.
“Any space that becomes a community space requires the input of an entire community and so that will necessarily require time and...the investment of key stakeholders from all areas of the College," she said. “And that won’t happen overnight."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some students, faculty, and alumni are criticizing the Harvard College admissions office for its public response to concerns applicants will be penalized for participating in protests related to the recent shooting in Parkland, Fla.
On Feb. 14, a gunman killed 17 people in a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland. In the aftermath of the massacre, high school students across the nation coordinated walk-outs to speak out against gun violence—stirring up fears that universities may disadvantage demonstrators when making admissions decisions.
After high schools in Texas and Washington threatened to punish students for joining demonstrations, more than 150 schools across the country—including Yale and MIT—issued statements assuring applicants activism-related discipline would not affect their admissions prospects. Many of these statements, often advertised on social media websites like Twitter or Facebook, specifically referenced the violence in Parkland.
The College joined its peers Friday, posting a “Statement from Harvard College Admissions”—since updated—on its website.
“The mission of Harvard College is to provide a deeply transformative liberal arts and sciences education that will prepare our students for a life of citizenship and leadership,” the original statement read. “As always, those who engage responsibly in exercising their rights and freedoms would not have their chances of admission compromised.”
Over the weekend, multiple alumni and prospective students contacted the admissions office to seek clarification on the College’s stance regarding protests, according to an email sent to some alumni by admissions office staff.
“Many applicants have contacted our office concerned with the effect such disciplinary action might have on their candidacy for admission,” admissions officer Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 wrote in the email.
The College’s statement did not mention Parkland, and Harvard has yet to publicize its comments on the Twitter or Facebook accounts associated with the admissions office, according to a review by The Crimson. Over the weekend, some students and faculty members criticized Harvard for these actions, alleging the College needed to do more.
“I’m sure Harvard will join these other colleges in defending the rights of high school students who are suspended for protesting gun policies,” Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 tweeted Sunday. “If it doesn’t, I plan to resign my professorship in protest.”
Juliet A. Lewis ’18, unaware the College had posted a statement online, circulated emails, documents, and a virtual petition Saturday—since closed—urging Harvard to explicitly assure applicants that participation in protests related to Parkland would not affect their admissions decisions.
“You don't have to believe in gun control reform to agree that the first amendment rights of high school students should be protected,” Lewis wrote in an email Saturday.
After learning Harvard had posted remarks, Lewis circulated an updated document asserting she was “disappointed” by what she called the College’s “lackluster reply.”
Harvard updated its original statement Monday evening to include explicit mention of peaceful protest.
“Fundamental to our mission is our belief that students have the right to protest peacefully about issues of concern to them,” the new statement reads.
The comments also include new reassurances that the College will not penalize applicants or admitted students for “engaging responsibly” in demonstrations that result in disciplinary action.
Critics of the original statement have yet to comment publicly on the changes. Some, though, say Harvard’s new statement is less personal than those published by other universities.
In a blog post last Thursday, MIT admissions dean Stuart Schmill wrote, “It would be at best quixotic, and at worst hypocritical, if we treated our applicants differently, penalizing them for engaging in responsible, responsive citizenship as the students at Stoneman Douglas and elsewhere have done.”
“Yale will NOT be rescinding anyone’s admission decision for participating in peaceful walkouts for this or other causes, regardless of any high school’s disciplinary policy. I, for one, will be cheering these students on from New Haven,” Yale admissions officer Hannah Mendlowitz wrote in a blog post.
Lewis declined further comment on her emails and petition. The online petition is now closed, though she wrote she plans to send it to the admissions office this coming Wednesday.
Sonya Kalara ’21 said that, while she is proud Harvard released a statement regarding student protests, she thinks the College’s updated response is still insufficient.
“The institution released this statement very quietly and the language is vague and passive. It would be better if they were encouraging students to protest!” she wrote in an email.
In response to a request for comment, University spokesperson Rachael Dane referred to the statement posted on the College’s website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Gabby Thomas took the baton, Harvard wasn’t even in contention for the top spot in the Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships 4x400-meter relay. About two seconds behind the first place sprinter from Columbia, and still several paces behind the number two runner from Penn, the junior co-captain passed her divisional opponents in 200 meters, and maintained her lead through the finish line.
With the 3:43.85 finish, the women’s 4x400-meter quartet of sophomores Zoe Hughes and Karina Joiner, freshman Olivia Okoli, and Thomas earned the third consecutive indoor gold for the Crimson in the event, and the second relay title for the program at the meet.
On Saturday and Sunday, the Harvard track and field teams traveled to the Dartmouth Leverone Field House to compete in the Ancient Eights division championships. Over the course of the two-day affair, the Crimson left Hanover, N.H., with a second place and 105 point effort by the women’s team in addition to a sixth place finish by the men—who accumulated 51 points.
“I just think that we are a young team with a lot of upswing in the next few years, and right now we are putting in the groundwork to make sure we can have a sustainable future,” co-captain Myles Marshall said. “I think the men performed at our potential this weekend but sometimes that’s just not enough. Moving forward, I think we are primed for a great outdoor season, adding events that are in our favor and consolidating ones that we are already strong in. We have work to do but the future is looking brighter than ever.”
Both junior co-captains, Thomas and Marshall, earned Most Outstanding Track Performers as a result of their efforts during the meet. For Thomas, this was her second consecutive year to finish the day holding the certificate.
“It means a lot to be Most Outstanding Performer because I put so much into this competition and we train all season for this one day,” Thomas said. “So having all of that hard work being recognized especially as an award is always really rewarding.”
Marshall had to overcome a deficit of his own en route to claim a gold Sunday afternoon.
As the anchor leg of the men’s 4x800, Marshall grabbed the baton behind Columbia’s Alek Sauer. The junior from Harvard finally broke the lead on the final turn finishing first in 7:32.84, just .18 seconds ahead of light-blue clad anchor leg.
“That’s just a chance to show off all the hard work you’ve been putting in the past several months,” Marshall said. “I was pretty surprised to see him jump ahead of me with 200 to go but knew that If i just stuck with him I would have a decent chance to pass him in the final stretch. I was just happy to be able to execute that strategy and get our team another 10 points.”
The 4x800-meter relay of Marshall, sophomore Mike Kolor, and freshmen Ryan Thrush and John Fish was one of the two relay teams to top the podium.
“It’s a huge honor to be an Ivy champ,” Fish said. “It’s so rare to get the opportunity to run with and learn from a runner as skilled as Myles, and that’s benefited all of us on the team tremendously—us freshmen especially. I’m so glad that the hard work of our group paid off and that we were able to leave it all out there and come away with the win. It’s an experience that I’m sure I’ll remember for the rest of my life.”
That was Marshall’s second 800-meter victory of the weekend. Prior to the relays, the Texas native competed in solo event. In 1:52.19, the junior grabbed gold for the second straight year in the indoor event.
Thomas was golden in more than just her relay as well. The junior co-captain grabbed the top spot in two other sprint events. On Saturday, Thomas won her 60-meter dash heat in 7.25 seconds—shattering a school, Ivy League, and meet record in the event. The next day, she went on to claim the gold in a 7.62 finish. The first place finish represented her third straight year to accomplish the feat.
But Thomas wasn’t done. In the 200-meter dash, the senior crossed the finish in 23.26 seconds, another gold, and another three-year streak of top-spot medals—the first Ivy League sprinter to accomplish the hat-trick.
On Saturday, Thomas earned her first medal of the championships, with a silver in long jump following a leap of 5.96 meters. Sophomore teammate Simi Fajemisin landed just behind her at 5.91 meters and earned the bronze.
Fajemisin returned on Sunday, and on Sunday, Fajemisin broke the school record in triple jump. Leaping 13.11 meters, the sophomore achieved an illustrious division title. The jump landed just four centimeters short of a qualifying jump for the national meet.
While Marshall claimed the men’s 800-meter dash title, junior Kathryn Gillespie helped the Crimson sweep the event with a cool, 2:09.77 gold-medal finish in the event. The win was Harvard’s first in the women’s side of the event in five seasons.
Sophomore Zoe Hughes, the 2017 indoor champion in the pentathlon, returned to defend her title. With first place finishes in the 60-meter hurdles and shot put, the second-year left the meet with a silver medal.
In other team relays, silver was the medal of choice for the sprinters in Crimson. The men’s 4x400-meter relay team earned second place in a competitive race that had three schools finish within .04 seconds of each other. Cornell crossed the line first, followed closely by the group of senior Matt Hurst, and freshmen Rodney Agyare-May, Jovahn Williamson, and Charles Lego.
The women’s distance medley relay team also netted second in a 11:33.95 effort. For the quartet, Gillespie got things rolling, followed by sophomore Micah Meekins and freshmen Anna Juul and Abbe Goldstein.
Next weekend, the team continues it’s indoor season with a short trip across the river to Boston University to compete the IC4A/ECAC Championships. The meet will serve as a last ditch effort to clock a qualifying time for the national meeting. Thomas has already punched her ticket to College Station in the 200-meter dash.
“This year was tough,” Thomas said. “We had a lot of injuries, sickness, had some girls walk off the team when we needed them, so we had to work with what we had. There were a lot of good things done this weekend—so there’s a lot to be proud of. In order to win, everything would’ve had to go perfectly, and you can’t always expect that. But everybody did compete hard and battled through some mental hardships and we came out pretty well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to win a national championship. It’s even harder when you’re playing at your opponent’s home court.
Facing the raucous crowds of Trinity, No. 3 Harvard men’s squash squared off with the defending national champions for the Potter Cup in a home national championship for the Bantams.
Taking to Hartford, Conn., the Crimson team took on familiar rivals en route to a second place finish at collegiate squash’s biggest stage—the College Squash Association (CSA) National Championships.
The team defeated Penn and upset Columbia before falling to Trinity (20-0) in the final. The second place finish is the second consecutive year the team has fallen in the championship match and the second consecutive year that the defeat has come at the hands of the Trinity squad.
HARVARD 3, TRINITY 6
Deep in enemy territory, at the No. 1 Bantam’s home court, the Crimson (13-2, 6-1 Ivy) faced a team that handed it a loss 10 days prior. In a match that mirrored this Sunday’s, only with smaller stakes, Harvard fell to its Connecticut opponents 7-2.
Things did not start out well. The Crimson dropped the first four matches and was only revived by a win from sophomore Timothy Brownell. The sophomore was matched up in the No. 2 slot against Thoboki Mohohlo—to whom he lost to in the last meeting in a five-game, marathon match. Out for blood, this time Brownell finished off Mohohlo in three clean sets, 11-7, 11-8, 11-4.
With life from Brownell’s win, things picked up for Harvard. Though playing after the match had already been decided, co-captain David Ryan grabbed a victory in the No. 4 slot against Trinity’s Rick Penders. The senior’s win was his 15th of the season, representing a perfect individual record throughout every match. Ryan’s win was one of five matches to reach the five game mark before finally ending. The Crimson came out on top in two such matches, a big increase from the zero of four the team took home against the Bantams two weekends ago.
Freshman Adam Corcoran’s match also went the five-game distance in what became the last matchup of the tournament. In the back-and-forth affair, the freshman won, lost, won, lost and finally won to earn Harvard its point.
Corcoran wasn’t the only member of the team in his first championship match, classmates Samuel Scherl and Julien Gosset also faced the noisy crowds of the Trinity Bantams. Julien pushed his match to five games at the No. 8 slot before dropping the last one.
“Playing in a national final was an incredible experience, especially for all the freshmen,” Scherl said. “Even though we were in front of a very rowdy Trinity home crowd, everyone including the freshmen really kept calm and didn’t let the pressure get to them. I think we all got a lot of valuable experience playing under pressure that we will bring to the next season which will make us even stronger.”
Co-captain Madhav Dhingra took his match to five games before dropping the last one in the No. 6 slot.
“I wish it went my way, as a senior, it was my last match ever,” Dhingra said. “But I did leave everything I had on the court so I have no regrets but I do wish it went the other way.”
HARVARD 6, COLUMBIA 3
The Crimson entered the CSA National Championships with two losses. One to Trinity, but the other to division rival, and No. 2 ranked Columbia (16-2, 7-0), 5-4. The loss earlier in the season was the first time that Harvard had ever lost to the Lions. The rematch came in the the national championship semi-final match.
“The mindset was just that everyone was training really hard, we had a lot of training in the bank, and we’ve given it our all in terms of preparation,” Dhingra said. “Then it was just going out and being our best selves. It’s not about winning or losing. We knew that if we played our best, we would win, but the idea is you just go out there, show incredible fight and manifest the best version of your game.”
However, Harvard entered with a fire that caught the Lions off guard. Within the first five games, the match had been clinched for the Crimson.
While the first four in Harvard’s lineup mirrored that of the matchup earlier in the season, the lower half of the team’s nine slots had been altered slightly.
Junior Alexi Gosset was the first of those changes that paid off for the Crimson. The junior started things off in the No. 9 slot with a clean, three-game sweep of his opponent. Alexi’s younger brother, Julien, secured the fourth win of the afternoon after Hughes replicated his performance in the beginning of the semester, but more efficiently.
Rather than the five games it took him in January, Hughes defeated Columbia’s Seif Attia in three games. In the No. 6 slot, Dhingra finished next, disposing of his opponent in three games. In the fifth slot, Scherl earned Harvard its fifth point of the afternoon, advancing the team to the championship match against an undefeated Bantam team for a shot at the Potter Cup.
Ryan earned the sixth and final win of the match in quick three-game bout in the No. 4 slot.
HARVARD 7, PENN 2
In the quarterfinal round of the national championship tournament, the Crimson took on the familiar rival of No. 6 Penn (11-7, 4-3). Though no guaranteed win, Harvard cleanly defeated the squad 7-2, a marked improvement from the team’s close 5-4 victory three weeks prior.
The Crimson claimed four points on 3-0 victories, coming from Brownell, Ryan, Scherl, and Julien.
In the No. 6 slot, Dhingra maintained his unbeaten streak at that spot in the lineup after defeating Derek Hsue in four games. Hughes and Alexi replicated the feat in the No. 3 and No. 9 spots, respectively.
“I was really proud of the team across the board this weekend,” Brownell said. “The seniors have led us through the entire season, and the national championships were no different. The composure they have even in the most difficult moments really sets the standard for the rest of us to follow, and our younger players did just that. The guys showed a lot of toughness to get through to the final and complete the way that we did on Sunday, and I couldn’t be happier to have been a part of this team.

On Feb. 17, the Museum of Fine Arts hosted a Stanley Kubrick Day, screening three of the esteemed director’s most popular films—“A Clockwork Orange,” “Dr. Strangelove,” and “The Shining”—in a day-long movie marathon. Crowds of people participated in the event, either stopping by for a quick flick or spending their entire Saturday appreciating Kubrick’s work. This Roving Reporter spoke with several participants, ranging from casual moviegoers to die-hard Kubrick fans, to find out more.
Alex Z. Xu and John M. Abreu, “Dr. Strangelove” viewers
Roving Reporter: What made you want to come today to the Stanley Kubrick event?
AZX: Well, I first watched one of his films about two years ago. It was “Full Metal Jacket,” and I enjoyed the movie very much. I thought he really grayed the line between what is right and what is wrong, and you know there’s a message there. But often times it’s hard to interpret what that message was. Because of its stimulating nature, I decided to come here and watch more of his work.
RR: Had you guys watched “Dr. Strangelove” before?
AX and JMA: No, first time.
RR: What did you think about it?
JMA: I thought it was really funny. It was a really interesting satire on the whole Cold War. I’m a big Kubrick fan. I found out about [the event] because [Alex] told me about it. I thought it was really cool that [the MFA] is having a Stanley Kubrick Day. This was my first time watching “Dr. Strangelove,” and this is definitely his most satirical movie as far as the ones that I’ve seen.
RR: What do you think it is about Stanley Kubrick’s movies that make him so memorable, or why the MFA is willing to put on a Stanley Kubrick Day?
JMA: I think that Stanley Kubrick, what’s different about him than other mainstream directors of his time or even now is that he’s like—he has no boundaries in the sense that he’s not afraid to, like in the case of “Dr. Strangelove,” trash the entire Cold War and that whole thing. And I think that’s the case with a lot of his movies. He’s very out there with what he decides to do. Even like with “The Shining” where there’s like so much imagery there that other directors wouldn’t even try to do.
AZX: For me, I think it just goes back to that stimulation—that mental stimulation. What is the message he’s trying to get across? I think the movie that really stuck with me in that regard is “Eyes Wide Shut.” There’s many theories about it: Is it about the AIDS epidemic? Is it about exposing the Illuminati? Or is it exposing what reality really is? Is what’s going on in your imagination also real? And I think it’s that ability of Stanley Kubrick to make you think about what he’s portraying, about what he’s trying to put out there. That’s what keeps me coming back. And that’s what I think makes him unique.
Eric G. Kane, day-long participant
RR: What’s your favorite Stanley Kubrick movie?
EGK: “2001: A Space Odyssey.” It’s also my favorite movie of all time.
RR: What do you think it is about Stanley Kubrick movies that stand out and make it so a museum is willing to allocate an entire day to screening his movies?
EGK: Style.
RR: What about his style?
EGK: He captures the dark side of humans without being in your face about it. So in all of his movies, the more alive part is the scenery, or the robot, or the nuclear missiles, or the guy who’s dropping the nuclear missile. Not just the people. And it’s abstract. There’s an abstract part of his movies that’s fun, but it’s also approachable. And it’s very ambitious, the stuff he likes to tell… Also, attention to detail, and just little things. Like [the titular character] Dr. Strangelove becoming more and more—as they go through the possibilities of what they’re going to do—getting more and more fascist. His hand’s becoming more and more alive. Like that’s great. That’s perfect.
Abby D. Duker ’19, “The Shining” viewer
RR: You said you only came to watch “The Shining.” Why is that?
ADD: Over J-term I did a Habitat for Humanity trip with my dear friend…who said that he really liked Stanley Kubrick. We came back from the trip and everybody really bonded, as one does, and we wanted to hang out. And when I found out about the Stanley Kubrick Day—specifically “The Shining,” (because “The Shining” was the one movie that came up repeatedly while we were on the trip) I was like, we have to go… So it was partially for reunion purposes, and partially for cultural purposes.
RR: Have you seen “2001: A Space Odyssey”?
ADD: Oh! Yes, I have. Yea, I saw that movie very recently. In fact, I saw it at the end of last semester.
RR: Did you like that one?
ADD: It was very weird. “The Shining” was a lot more—this movie really held your hand in that it was super easy to follow and know what was happening. In “2001: A Space Odyssey” I was like—what is going on? I watched it and was like, what is happening?
RR: Based on those two movies that you have seen, what do you think about Kubrick’s style?
ADD: I thought it was very pleasant to look at long shots in which Jack Nicholson is centered in a really symmetrical background. I liked that. I also liked the shots where [the camera] followed people. It felt like the way you feel when you’re following around an important person and you’re just like their assistant or their secretary or their scribe or something. I just liked the experience of being in the camera… You felt like you were smaller, shorter, less important and trying to catch up the entire time. That was not a central shot for the film at all but I just liked it, and I liked a lot of other shots in the film.
RR: What did you think about the MFA hosting it?

Section means an hour of sitting in a room discussing subject matter with peers, whom you’ve either never seen before, or whom you’ve seen every day of college because there are 13 Folk and Myth concentrators. Section is the time to learn, study for other classes, or catch some z’s. But when participation makes up a third of your grade, there’s the added pressure of speaking in class. A dilemma arises: you don’t want your A to slip away because you never talk in section, but you don’t want to be “section kid” either. Here are some tips on how to welcome participation points without welcoming hatred from your peers.
Don’t dwell in disputes
Even if another student says something triggering or flat out wrong, a petty correction isn’t the most productive way to respond. Instead, try to respectfully address that student’s opinion, and move the discussion forward, rather than dwelling on their error.
Read passages and instructions
Participation includes all types of verbal contribution, including reading passages aloud. Many people avoid this kind of participation, thinking they can only contribute “original” discussion points, but TFs always appreciate it when someone volunteers to read.
Sit in the back
If you’re going to participate a lot, do it from the back of the room. This strategic position makes multitasking on your laptop a possibility, and keeps you from looking like a front-and-center teacher’s pet.
Space out your spiels
Don’t be that kid who talks every other turn. Instead, just discuss your contentions at the beginning and end of section. Your comments’ primacy and recency will make your TF more likely to remember you participation.
Participate in other avenues
To make an impression on your TF without making your peers’ eyes roll, show up to office hours to make your course engagement and knowledge known. Maybe you’ve been eying a “Classroom to Table” excursion for some time now. Don’t be afraid to go for it: you might find a truly rewarding interaction—and potential recommendation writer—in these outside-of-class exchanges.
